Foreword
John V. Pavlik
Rarely has a book provided a more timely, thoughtful or comprehensive 
perspective than Social Media: Usage and Impact. Hana S. Noor Al-Deen 
and John Allen Hendricks have edited a masterful collection of chapters both 
theoretically strong and empirically compelling in their analysis of the nature 
and influence of social media in the U.S. in a broad cross-section of domains, 
from education to politics.
Drawing upon top scholars from a diverse range of schools and disciplines, 
each chapter examines critically and insightfully the use and consequences 
of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Original data have 
been collected and analyzed to provide detailed portraits of how these emer-
gent new forms of user-generated content (UGC) are transforming mediated 
communication in the 21st century.
Editors Noor Al-Deen and Hendricks have organized the chapters in an 
intelligent and coherent conceptual road map to the domain of social media. 
Students of social networks will come away with a fresh understanding of how 
UGC is fundamentally reshaping mediated communication on multiple levels. 
Not just how people communicate but the form and substance of those com-
munications are being transformed in the process. Moreover, the relationships 
between and among social institutions and political organizations are undergo-
ing a metamorphosis as revealed in the chapters of this ground-breaking book.
Both senior scholars as well as new entrants to the field will find Social Media: 
Usage and Impact required reading. It will quickly establish itself as a book that 
provides lasting insight and sound theoretical foundation for an emerging field.
Doctors Hana S. Noor Al-Deen and John Allen Hendricks are to be com-
mended for having moved swiftly yet carefully on their edited book, Social 
Media: Usage and Impact.

Preface
Social media such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, Flickr, and oth-
ers have been growing at a tremendous rate and the adoption rate of such media 
has been skyrocketing which, in turn, has delivered astronomical numbers of 
users in less than 10 years. As a consequence of this astounding phenomenon 
involving both the rapid emergence of this cutting-edge technology and its 
adoption, social media have become an integral part of the contemporary class-
room, of advertising and public relations industries, of political campaigning, 
and of numerous other aspects of our daily existence. The incorporation of this 
massive media upsurge brings with it challenges and opportunities that need 
to be analyzed through scholarly research. Thus, this book provides a truly 
comprehensive and scholarly analysis of social media while it combines power-
ful factors which are the implementation and effect of social media in various 
environments including educational settings, strategic communication (which 
is often considered to be a merging of advertising and public relations), politics, 
as well as in legal and ethical issues. All chapters constitute original research 
while using various research methodologies for analyzing and presenting sig-
nificant information about social media.
The book serves as a tremendous source for the curriculum, educators, 
practitioners (such as advertising, PR, and media industries), libraries, per-
sonal source, and many others who are interested in using social media as 
a tool in their professions. It is designed as a reader for upper-level under-
graduate and graduate level courses intended to explore the emerging role of 
and impact of social media as they evolve. The book constitutes an excellent 
choice to use in any media technology course. With the rapid proliferation 
and adoption of social media, it is a juggernaut that must be addressed in the 
higher education curriculum and research.

Preface
The chapters were grouped into five major parts with each part present-
ing a sample of related topics. Part I: Social Media and Social Networking 
provided a general perspective about the social networking within the social 
media. Chapter 1 analyzed how aspects of users’ pages relate to users’ levels 
of connectedness and engagement on Facebook. Chapter 2 focused on the 
persuasive aspects of social media and the networks on which they operate 
while examining how the social and technical features of those media affect 
the communication they enable. Chapter 3 explained how people use social 
media to discuss the dominant mass media.
Part II: Social Media and Education demonstrated the use of social media 
in the academic settings while keeping in mind the dynamic synergy within 
the practicality and content capabilities of these tools. Because education 
tends to be the overall area most sought after by educators, we expanded 
this part to 4 chapters. Chapter 4 focused on the effects of personalization 
and interactivity related to engagement and collaboration. Specifically, it 
explored whether social media can facilitate learning by enhancing students’ 
engagement, identity and enjoyment of a given course, independent of the 
content to be learned. Chapter 5 provided an assessment of how incorporating 
a variety of new technologies as a means for enhancing the communicative 
and collaborative potential of the large lecture setting impacted not only the 
daily dynamics of the class but also its pedagogical potential as a result of its 
inclusive design. Chapter 6 discussed different approaches of using Twitter in 
the classroom and how instructors and students can productively utilize Twit-
ter in class. Chapter 7 examined the benefits and challenges of using social 
media in higher education as well as explored the possibilities of collabora-
tion within and among the student, faculty and alumni populations.
Part III: Social Media and Strategic Communication explored how social 
media can be used to achieve specific public relations strategies as well as to 
achieve specific advertising and marketing objectives. Chapter 8 focused on 
attitudes and perceptions about social media among college students (major-
ing in public relations and advertising) and professionals involved and not 
involved in strategic communication. Chapter 9 focused on how companies 
use social media to inform and engage consumers while creating a sense of 
exclusivity for consumers who partake in social media. Chapter 10 examined 
how firms adopt social media on their websites and how they utilize them to 
realize relationship marketing and branding functions.
Part IV: Social Media and Politics sought to explain the function of social 
media in modern politics and the viral influence of such media. Chapter 11 
provided an examination of the usage and impact of social media and the 
millennial generation during the 2010 midterm election. Chapter 12 evaluated 
the possibilities and limitations of social media in promoting and facilitating

youth in civic engagement. Chapter 13 explored how shifting race-gender 
dynamics in the Obama moment created challenges and possibilities for 
black-male participation.
Part V: Social Media and Legal/Ethical Issues assessed the legal and ethi-
cal dimensions of social media. Chapter 14 used existing social media case 
studies to illustrate the legal pitfalls of social media usage and explained how 
the law is adapting to address new problems generated by social media usage. 
Chapter 15 examined what is now considered public and private with respect 
to “personal information” and social media. Chapter 16 considered how eth-
ics relates to social media and explored the implications that social media 
have for the field of ethics in communication.

Chapter One
Facebook: How College 
Students Work It
Lynne M. Webb, Megan L. Wilson, 
Maggie Hodges, Peter A. Smith, and Monica Zakeri
College students, often living away from home for the first time, may engage 
in social interaction for many reasons, including finding a sense of connected-
ness or belonging in the college community (Zakahi, Jordan, & Christophel, 
1993; Walther, Van der Heide, Kim, Westerman, & Tong, 2008). While 
many of the interactions in college networks take place face-to-face, current 
technology allows for online interaction as well. Henderson, Taylor, and 
Thomson (2002) reported that, for students at the “‘critical moment’ of begin-
ning college, computer-mediated social networks play an increasingly central 
role in the success of transitioning to college” (p. 501). Online interactions 
may be especially useful for students who are introverted or shy (Baker & 
Oswald, 2010; Stritzke, Nguyen, & Durkin, 2004).
Facebook initially allowed only college students to become members, and 
remains the most popular social media among college students. In a recent 
study, college students “reported using Facebook approximately 30 minutes 
throughout the day as part of their daily routine” (Pempek, Yermolayeva, & 
Calvert, 2009, p. 227). Facebook expanded to allow any member of the public 
to join, and now reports more Internet traffic than any other social media in 
the U.S. (Schonfeld, 2008). This study examined how college students use 
Facebook as a social media utility. Specifically, this study examined how as-
pects of users’ pages (anonymity and stated relational goals) relates to users’ 
levels of connectedness (number of friends, groups, and wall postings) and 
engagement (number of applications and photo albums) on Facebook.

Lynne M. Webb et al.
SOCIAL NETWORKING ONLINE
Social media provide opportunities for users to engage in self-presentation 
of identity (DeAndrea, Shaw, & Levine, 2010; Grasmuck, Martin, & Zhao, 
2009; Pempek et al., 2009; Zhao, Grasmucks, & Martina, 2008) and “talk” 
with family, friends, and colleagues (Mazer, Murphy, & Simonds, 2007; 
Page, 2010; Pempek et al., 2009). Unlike traditional social network research 
examining face-to-face relationships, the focus of social media research re-
mains on individual-to-individual communication rather than on relationships 
or connections. Indeed, this study discovered and reviewed over 25 previous 
studies of Facebook and found very few articles on relationships enacted via 
Facebook or the connections between Facebook relationships (Baker & Os-
wald, 2010; Lewis & West, 2009). In contrast, the vast majority of the studies 
examined users’ individual opinions of behaviors enacted via Facebook, in-
cluding communicative behavior (Debatin, Lovejoy, Horn, & Hughes, 2009) 
or content analyzed messages on Facebook (Taraszow, Aristodemou, Shitta, 
Laouris, & Arsoy, 2010). In sum, scholars treat Facebook as a channel of 
communication for social interaction rather than as a place for users to make 
important connections and for those relationships to form overriding patterns 
worthy of study. The only exception to this claim concerns research on strong 
versus weak ties, as discussed below.
Further, online social interactions fundamentally differ from face-to-face 
interactions in offline social networks. Online social networking typically of-
fers opportunities for expression that are less restrictive. Users may disclose 
at levels quite different than in their face-to-face conversations (Debatin et 
al., 2009; George, 2006; Gozzi, 2010). Further, “Facebook users predomi-
nantly claim their identities implicitly rather than explicitly; they ‘show and 
tell’ and stress group and consumer identities over personally narrated ones” 
(Zhao et al., 2008, p. 1816). While alternative identities may be assumed and 
gender-bending can occur, such experimentation is not likely on Facebook 
where users retain offline ties with online interactants. Many, if not most us-
ers, employ online social networks simply to augment offline relationships 
(Pempek et al., 2009).
While online social networks differ from face-to-face social networks in 
important ways, they nonetheless function as a viable channel for interac-
tion (Memmi, 2006). In describing Facebook specifically, Wasike and Cook 
(2010) noted that “Never before have so many people gathered to commu-
nicate through a single medium” (p. 1). Maintenance of relationships online 
has become common (Pauley & Emmers-Sommer, 2007). Diani (2000) con-
cluded that while online communities lack some of the fundamental require-

ments that connect face-to-face social networks, they function effectively 
when “backed by real social linkages” in face-to-face communities (p. 396).
FACEBOOK AS A SOCIAL MEDIA UTILITY
With over 500 million active users, Facebook provides a virtual reality in 
cyberspace where users can enact identities for their friends, acquaintances, 
and a larger passing public. Facebook provides college students mecha-
nisms for communicating with peers in a focused and meaningful way. 
College life focuses on academic and social community; joining interest-
oriented communities on Facebook (e.g., fan groups for movies, musical 
groups, sports teams, and so on as well as interest-based groups around 
common interests, activities, and hobbies) can provide a lonely student with 
a strong sense of belonging.
Users join Facebook by creating a homepage that typically provides ex-
plicit details about the user’s identity (e.g., sex, religion, political affiliation) 
as well as likes and dislikes. When creating a homepage, the new user is 
asked a series of standard questions as a means of composing the homepage. 
After answering initial questions, users can further personalize their pages via 
Facebook applications that range from the informational (e.g., link to your 
“other” website, display “bumper stickers” that represent users’ philosophies) 
to the serious (e.g., display charities and political candidates that the user 
supports financially and thus encourage others to do so) to the frivolous (e.g., 
take the quiz “what kind of chocolate are you?”). Personalizing pages allows 
users to display identity and users can modify the content of their homepages 
at any time. For many users, creating and changing online content is becom-
ing an integral means of managing identity, lifestyle, and social relationships 
(Livingstone, 2008).
After creating a homepage, the user can add friends by searching for them 
by name or e-mail address across the Facebook membership. Friends can 
“talk” to one another via Facebook’s instant messaging function, via its email 
function, by writing on the wall of the friend’s homepage, and simply by 
posting a current status update (e.g., “I finally finished reading that chapter 
on Facebook.”). According to Facebook, the average user has 130 friends. 
“Facebook friends” mutually acknowledge their friendship and display each 
other as friends on their homepages. These friendships can form online or, as 
is more often the case, function as an acknowledgment of and supplement to 
offline relationships (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007). In describing how 
college students use Facebook, Walther et al. (2008) noted that, “Even when 

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
6 
Lynne M. Webb et al.
previously unacquainted individuals meet offline at college, they check the 
other’s Facebook profile to learn more about that person and whether there 
are any common friends or experiences” (p. 31). Facebook relationships can 
represent and function as strong ties (family and close friends) or weak ties 
(acquaintances) (Boyd & Ellison, 2008; Ellison et al., 2007). Facebook pro-
motes primarily weak ties among college students (Lewis & West, 2009), and 
research provides mixed results on the importance and influence of weak ties 
(Lewis & West, 2009).
Facebook is not one homogenous group of users. Instead, Facebook users 
create subgroups every day where individuals can find acceptance and cama-
raderie among like-minded users. Representations of minority philosophies, 
ethnicities, and sexual orientations may be convenient and relatively safe 
for Facebook users. Indeed, researchers have examined aspects of minority 
representation on Facebook (Honeycutt & Cunliffe, 2010; Walther, 2009; 
Wasike & Cook, 2010). Such groups may offer a sense of belonging and 
opportunities for expression that are less restrictive than face-to-face interac-
tion where issues of acceptance and negative stereotyping may arise. In sum, 
Facebook offers a virtual reality where users can display, identify, and find 
others like themselves.
Why is Facebook so popular with college students? The answer may lie 
in its many uses or functions. In addition to the obvious roles of providing 
a venue to display identity (DeAndrea et al., 2010; Grasmuck et al., 2009; 
Pempek et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2008) and for communication with other 
users (Mazer et al., 2007; Page, 2010; Pempek et al., 2009), “checking 
Facebook” can become “deeply integrated in users’ daily lives through 
specific routines and rituals” (Debatin et al., 2009, p. 83) as well as a ready 
source of social drama (Gozzi, 2010). Further, a recent survey reported that 
Facebook can serve six additional functions in users’ lives: pastime, affec-
tion, fashion, share problems, sociability, and social information (Quan-
Hasse & Young, 2010).
Previous research on Facebook has examined many interesting aspects of 
homepages including language use (Honeycutt & Cunliffe, 2010) and the 
narrative potential of status updates (Page, 2010), as well as aspects of Face-
book friendships including perceptions of the number of friends (Tong, Van 
der Heide, & Langwell, 2008), maintenance of Facebook friendships (Ellison 
et al., 2007) and quality of Facebook friendships (Baker & Oswald, 2010). 
Further, researchers have examined political activism on Facebook (Langlois, 
Elmer, McKelvey, & Devereaux, 2009), and the political participation of 
Facebook users (Valenzuela, Park, & Kee, 2009). However, no previously 
published research report could be located providing baseline data on how 
college students use Facebook as a social media utility. While many previ-

ous researchers surveyed and interviewed college student Facebook users on 
how and why they log onto Facebook, only four previously published studies 
examine actual Facebook homepages (DeAndrea et al., 2010; Grasmuck et 
al., 2009; Taraszow et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2008) and none analyzed data on 
how the college students use Facebook as a social media utility.
COMPONENTS OF FACEBOOK AS AN 
ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING UTILITY
Gender and Biological Sex
In online initial interactions, users’ biological sex may remain unknown. 
However, Thomson (2006) posited that even in such situations, gender 
manifests in the language usage. Once manifest, users’ biological sex can 
play a significant role in mediated communicative behavior, as females tend 
to self-disclose more to close friends than males and display greater socia-
bility than males (Igarashi, Takai, & Yoshida, 2005). Previous researchers 
reported differences in Facebook behaviors by biological sex (Taraszow et 
al., 2010; Walther et al., 2008; Wang, Moon, Kwon, Evans, & Stefanone, 
2010). However, the full extent of the influence of biological sex in online 
communication remains unknown. Therefore, we elected to assess differ-
ences by users’ self-reported biological sex to discover potential differences 
by biological sex.
Relational Goals
Users may employ social media to meet their relational goals (e.g., to meet 
potential friends and dating partners). To achieve these goals, users often 
attempt to manage impressions they make on others (Walther et al., 2008). 
Some users choose to disclose their relational goals on Facebook, while oth-
ers do not. This study assessed disclosure of relational goals to discover its 
potential relationship with anonymity and connectedness.
Anonymity
While some users provide many information bits about self-identity, other 
users find it advantageous to develop online profiles that disclose little per-
sonal information. Stritzke et al. (2004) claimed that this control over levels 
of anonymity can lead some users to feel more comfortable with higher lev-
els of self-disclosure. Indeed, Debatin et al. (2009) reported that Facebook 

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
8 
Lynne M. Webb et al.
users “claimed to understand privacy issues, yet reported uploading large 
amounts of personal information” (p. 83). Conversely, Bardini and Horvath 
(1995) argued that users who consciously prepare online images often face 
the dialectic of revealing positive self-information versus the uncertainty 
about appropriate disclosure. Thus, some users may be high self-disclosers 
on Facebook, while others may choose to maintain high levels of anonymity.
Connectedness
Given that social media consist of users, user groups, and the messages 
between them, it seemed reasonable to assess Facebook connectedness by 
counting the number of friends, number of groups, and number of wall post-
ings on sampled homepages.
Engagement
According to Goodman (2007), online social media provide users means to 
express their personalities and views in a public forum. Facebook provides 
many ways for users to express their personalities and views including ap-
plications and the posting of photographs. According to Facebook Statistics, 
“More than 30 billion pieces of content (web links, news stories, blog posts, 
notes, photo albums, etc.) are shared each month” and “People on Facebook 
install 20 million applications every day” (2011, para. 2 & 4). Given their 
prominence, this study elected to assess Facebook engagement by counting 
the number of applications and photographs on the sampled homepages.
PURPOSE STATEMENT AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
This study undertook an analysis of how college students use Facebook as a 
social media utility. The purpose was to examine the use of the basic elements 
of Facebook and to assess the potential relationships among those elements 
to discover larger patterns of use. Specifically, this study examined college 
students’ homepages on Facebook to examine four basic elements: 1) ano-
nymity, 2) stated relational goals, 3) engagement (number of photo albums 
and applications), and 4) connectedness (number of wall postings, friends, 
and groups). To this end, the following research questions were posed and 
figure 1.1 offers a pictorial display of the research questions:
RQ1: To what extent, if any, do relational goals influence the degree of 
anonymity users elect, users’ level of engagement (i.e., number of photo

albums and applications), and users’ level of connectedness (i.e., number 
of friends, number of groups, and number of wall postings)?
RQ2: To what extent, if any, does users’ degree of anonymity influence us-
ers’ level of engagement and connectedness?
RQ3: To what extent, if any, does users’ level of engagement influence users’ 
level of connectedness?
METHOD
Virtually all published research on Facebook has collected data in one of 
three ways: 1) by gathering data from users (Baker & Oswald, 2010), 2) by 
analyzing discourse on the site, such as descriptions of groups (Honeycutt 
& Cunliffe, 2010), or 3) by examining users’ homepages (DeAndrea et al., 
2010). This study employed the latter, as it can be argued that such data most 
accurately reflected the lived reality of how college students use Facebook. 
Unlike many social networking sites, Facebook has multiple built-in param-
eters that make it conducive to empirical analysis (e.g., initial questions about 
biological sex and relational goals). This study examined a sample of college 
students’ homepages, collecting data on how the students answered these ini-
tial questions as well as the ways they had personalized their pages by adding 
applications, photos, etc.
Sample
This study sampled homepages from four Facebook college networks to ex-
amine how a sample of U.S. college students use Facebook as a social media

utility. This study examined the homepages of 1% (N = 579) of the registered 
Facebook users who self-reported as students on the four sampled networks. 
Please note that the four previously published analysis of Facebook users’ 
homepages (DeAndrea et al., 2010; Grasmuck et al., 2009; Taraszow al., 
2010; Zhao et al., 2008) analyzed 63, 83, 120, and 131 homepages. In con-
trast, this study examined and coded 579 homepages to provide a potentially 
more accurate view of their content.
This study’s opportunistic sample of four U.S. college networks included 
one public Eastern university and three public Southeastern universities. 
The four universities included a large, flagship research university, a large 
secondary university, and two smaller regional universities. To create an 
incident-rich sample, this study eliminated homepages with less than one 
application. The sample consisted of homepages whose owners self-reported 
as 44% (N = 256) male, 48% (N = 278) female and 8% (N = 45) who failed 
to indicate biological sex. Page owners reported ages ranging from 18 to 55 
(M = 22.38, SD = 4.13). The eastern university comprised 42% (N = 241) 
of the sample; the three southeastern universities comprised 36% (N = 210), 
11% (N = 64), and 11% (N = 66), respectively. The number of friends on the 
sampled pages ranged from 0 to 4,972 (M = 267.41, SD = 329.21) and num-
ber of groups ranged from 0 to 467 (M = 23.55, SD = 30.91). The number of 
applications ranged from 0 to 35 (M = 9.13, SD = 5.99).
MEASUREMENT
Biological Sex, Relational Goals, and Other Aspects 
of Online Identity
When creating a profile, Facebook users may indicate biological sex by em-
ploying a drop-down menu with the options male and female. Additionally, 
Facebook users have the option to display a birthday on their profile, includ-
ing birth year. The majority (86%) of the sampled page owners self-reported 
between the ages of 18 and 25; 96% were age 30 or below. Finally, users 
have the option of choosing one of four relational goals: “friendship 49% 
(N = 268),” “dating 11% (N = 57),” “networking (N = 0),” and “a relationship 
8% (N = 42).” Inter-coder agreement for these variables was 100%.
Anonymity
Anonymity was defined as the extent to which users withheld personal infor-
mation on their homepage. To assess anonymity, the number of identifying 
factors each user completed was counted; such factors included age, biologi-

Facebook

cal sex, political views, religious views, relationship status, sexual orienta-
tion, and relational goals. For each factor completed, a user received a score 
of zero and for each factor not provided, the page was assigned one point. 
Thus, the higher the number, the higher the degree of anonymity. Anonymity 
scores ranged from 0 to 7 with a mean of 2.43 (SD = 1.65). Inter-coder agree-
ment for this variable was 100%.
Connectedness
Facebook serves as an online space in which social relationships can form 
(Mazer et al., 2007). For purposes of this study, connection (or connected-
ness) was defined as affiliation with others. Connectedness was assessed in 
three ways: number of friends, number of groups, and number of wall post-
ings on the Facebook homepage. Facebook users can find friends through 
a function called “friend finder” in which they search for specific names or 
email addresses. Users also can browse for potential friends via common 
interests or common friends within their network. Users can find groups on 
Facebook by looking at friends’ pages, browsing available groups, or search-
ing for specific groups by topic (e.g., Green Bay Packers, antiques). Finally, 
users have the option of writing short messages on friends’ walls. A user can 
only write on another user’s wall if they are friends. While this is not the 
only study to examine wall postings (Walther et al., 2008), no previously 
published research could be located that counted wall posts.
To assess connectedness, this study counted the number of friends 
(N ranged from 0-4972; M = 267.41; SD = 329.21), groups (N ranged from 
0-467; M = 23.55; SD = 30.92), and wall postings (N ranged from 0-3598; 
M = 277.52; SD = 438.77) on sampled pages. Inter-coder agreement on 
these indicators was 100%.
Engagement
For purposes of this study, engagement was defined as taking advantage of 
the two common utilities within the website, displaying photographs and 
applications. While this study is not the first to examine posted photographs 
(Walther et al., 2008), it is the first to count the number of photographs 
displayed. Facebook offers free access to thousands of applications (micro 
computer programs that complete specific tasks such as conversion to metric 
measurement and displaying detailed maps of Paris), with approximately 140 
new applications added daily (Zuckerberg, 2008). Over 24,000 applications 
were added between May 2007 and April 2008, the first year that Facebook 
allowed software developers free access to its network (Richmond, 2008).

Lynne M. Webb et al.
More than 95% of Facebook users have at least one application on their 
page (Zuckerberg, 2008). Successful applications “provide a useful service, 
entertain users and allow Facebook friends to easily mingle with each other” 
(Richmond, 2008, p. B7). Intercoder reliability for these measures was 100%.
PROCEDURES
This study employed an opportunistic sampling of four college networks 
on Facebook by randomly selecting 1% of users’ pages on four campus 
networks, yielding a sample of 579 pages. Each of four coders signed on to 
Facebook and clicked on the “Browse All Networks” tab and next on the 
“Colleges” tab. From there, they selected different states (Arkansas, Georgia, 
Tennessee, and Virginia) and clicked on the network to which they belonged, 
thus discovering the number of network users in each network, enabling cal-
culation of 1% of each sampled network. They randomly selected pages using 
a Facebook feature that lists a random selection of pages from the network. 
The sample included only homepages of users who self-reported as students 
and maintained open pages. Each selected page was screen printed to archive 
a static copy of the data.
The study’s procedures were pilot tested with 20 pages drawn from the 
research sample. No major flaws in the data collection system emerged. Then, 
four coders (all first semester MA students in Communication) individually 
counted the indicators for each variable in the same room on a given after-
noon. To address the issue of fatigue, coders took a 20-minute break after 
each hour. To ensure inter-coder reliability, coders examined a randomly 
assigned 1% of a fellow coder’s sample. Coders compiled data into an Excel 
spreadsheet, then imported the Excel file into SPSS for analysis. The standard 
alpha level of .05 to assess significance was used.
RESULTS
An examination of the frequency distributions revealed that several variables 
of interest displayed non-normal distributions with skew and/or kurtosis scores 
beyond the plus-or-minus-two standard-deviation range (see table 1.1). There-
fore, nonparametric statistics were calculated for all subsequent analyses.
The Mann-Whitney U “is one of the most powerful of the nonparametric 
tests, and it is a useful alternative to the parametric t” (Siegel, 1956, p. 116). 
A series of Mann-Whitney U tests revealed only two significant differences 
by users’ reported biological sex (male versus female) across the six variables

of interest (see table 1.1). Therefore, the data were combined for all subse-
quent analyses and treated as one sample.
A series of Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted to answer RQ 1 (i.e., 
to assess the potential influence of the stated relational goals—friendship, 
dating, a relationship—on level of engagement and connectedness). Eighteen 
potential differences were assessed. The analyses revealed ten significant 
differences by stated relational goals across the six variables of interest (see 
table 1.2). Figure 1.2 displays the confirmed relationships. Taken as a whole, 
the results answer RQ1 in the affirmative; engagement and connectedness 
varied by stated relational goals.
Finally, Spearman’s rho correlations were calculated to answer RQ 2 and 
3 (i.e., to assess the potential relationships between anonymity, engage-
ment, and connectedness). The analyses revealed 15 significant correla-
tions among the 15 tested relationships (see table 1.3). Figure 1.2 displays 
the confirmed relationships. Taken as a whole, these results answer RQ 2 
and 3 in the affirmative; they indicate that anonymity, engagement, and 
connectedness are highly interrelated. Engagement and connectedness are 
positively related and thus appear mutually influential. In contrast, anonym-
ity is negatively related to both engagement and connectedness. Post-hoc 
analyses including regression analyses and path analyses seemed the next 
logical step. However, given the non-normalcy of the variable distributions, 
such parametric analyses would have been inappropriate and no equivalent 
nonparametric analyses exist.
CONCLUSION
Figure 1.2 offers a pictorial display of the results. In the sample, anonymity 
varied by relational goals (friendship, dating, and a relationship) and sampled 
pages that acknowledged relational goals had higher levels of anonym-
ity (Friendship Myes = 3.38, SDyes = 1.54; Mno = 1.38, SDno = 1.03; Dating 
Myes = 2.60, SDyes = 1.65; Mno = 1.05, SDno = 0.83; A Relationship Myes = 2.55, 
SDyes = 1.65; Mno = 1.09, SDno = 0.88). These findings indicated that, in this 
sample, users who openly acknowledged relational goals engaged in more 
anonymity and less disclosure than users who do not state relational goals. 
Further, the results indicated that, in the sample, anonymity, engagement, 
and connectedness were inter-correlated. More specifically, higher levels of 
anonymity were associated with lower levels of engagement and lower levels 
of connectedness. Conversely, higher levels of engagement were associated 
with significantly higher levels of connectedness.

Interpretation
A primary purpose of the study was to discover how Facebook functions as 
a social media utility. Two primary insights emerge from this study’s results. 
First, the data offer a detailed description of social networking elements 
employed on Facebook (i.e., anonymity, relational goals, engagement, con-
nectedness) and the relationships between them as enacted among one sample 
of college students from four universities. For example, one basic information 
bit that serves as an element of social networking on Facebook is relational 
goals (specifying goals of friendship, dating, or a relationship as part of the 
users’ online identity). In the sample, users who acknowledged relational

goals differed significantly from users who did not acknowledge goals 
across three Facebook elements under study (i.e., anonymity, engagement, 
and connectedness). Users who declared relational goals employed higher 
engagement and connectedness. Users in this sample who acknowledged 
relational goals disclosed less, perhaps presenting a carefully edited portrayal 
of themselves. They also accumulated a greater number of connections, per-
haps joining groups, and “friending” as a means of finding others to achieve 
their relational goals of finding additional relational partners. Finally, users in 
this sample with stated goals engaged with their Facebook friends by posting 
pictures and employing applications, perhaps an additional means to achieve 
relational goals.
Another Facebook element, anonymity, was seldom studied in previous 
Facebook research, perhaps because the idea of remaining anonymous within 
a social medium seems oxymoronic as it may limit communication. Yet, from 
a social exchange perspective, Facebook users may calculate their perceived 
risk and weigh that risk against the possible rewards (Trevino, 2007). If a user 
perceives the cost of disclosing information as higher than the reward of re-
maining anonymous, then he or she might choose the latter option. Certainly 
many users elect to provide minimal information, perhaps in part to present 
a carefully edited, positive portrayal. Finally, Facebook may provide users 
a sense of connection (or connectedness) with their “friends.” A Facebook 
friendship circle may include strong ties (e.g., family or friends) and weak 
ties (e.g., acquaintances). The findings indicate that such connection is posi-
tively associated with Facebook engagement.
Second, the results provide insights into how Facebook functions as a so-
cial media utility. The results indicate that the more users engage the web-
site through use of its utilities (applications and photo albums), the more 
connected they become in a Facebook culture (increasing their number of 
friends, groups, and wall postings) and vice versa. Only two factors here 
examined appear to limit the embeddedness created by the strong correla-
tion between engagement and connectedness in this sample—anonymity 
and relational goals.
Participants may log on and join Facebook for the purpose of interacting 
with others. However, users may quickly experience the dialectic of interact-
ing via social media (and the accompanying vulnerability) versus the need 
for anonymity (Petronio, 2002). Facebook is unique in that it allows a great 
deal of self-selection in presentation of personal information (Walther et al., 
2008), thus allowing the user to control anonymity and repeatedly experience 
choice-making regarding privacy versus disclosure. However, when users 
chose to maintain lower levels of self-disclosure on Facebook, they offer 
fewer platforms for others to find similarities, and thus for cued interaction

and relationship development. Indeed, in this sample, anonymity was nega-
tively associated with number of friends as well as other indicators of con-
nection and engagement.
Finally, users in the sample differed in their level of engagement (number 
of albums and applications) depending on their relational goals (friendship, 
dating, and a relationship). While Facebook allows users to indicate one or 
more relational goals, in this sample, users who indicated they were seeking 
friendship actually had fewer “friends” than users with other relational goals. 
Perhaps three issues are confounding the findings on relational goals: First, 
a Facebook “friend” is anyone allowed to view the user’s page and thus may 
include strangers and acquaintances as well as intimate partners. Second, the 
selected goal of “friendship” does not speak to quality or quantity. A user 
may elect to interact on Facebook only with very close friends and their 
primary dating partner or, conversely, to interact with as many prospective 
friends as possible. Finally, perhaps users with the fewest friends want to 
make more friends via Facebook.
Taken as a whole, the results indicate that Facebook can function as a 
seductive social medium, potentially quite engaging to users, as here docu-
mented with one large sample of college students from four campuses. In-
deed, the study’s data indicated that as users became more embedded within 
the culture of Facebook, the website allowed further expansion of the user’s 
friendship circle (i.e., engagement was highly correlated with connection). 
However, the study’s findings indicate that, in the sample, Facebook’s seduc-
tiveness was limited by two factors: the users’ enactment of anonymity and 
his/her relational goals.
Limitations of the Study and Suggestions for Future Research
A field study of only one prevalent social medium was conducted, which may 
not accurately represent other social media. Additionally, while the sample 
was diverse in many ways, homepages were drawn from self-described stu-
dents in only four college networks versus the hundreds of college networks 
on Facebook. Conducting field studies on social media websites not designed 
for college students (i.e., MySpace, Friendster, etc.) might provide a more ho-
listic perspective on Facebook as a social-networking website. Because this 
study sampled only Eastern and Southeastern universities, the sample failed 
to account for potential regional differences and was not a representative 
national sample. Additionally, the sample focused solely on college students 
and not other categories of users who employ social networking utilities. 
Finally, Facebook pages contain users’ self-reported information, which may 
or may not be accurate.

Despite the above described limitations, this study augments an under-
standing of social media in multiple ways. First, the research offers a detailed 
description of the premier online social media website, Facebook. Second, the 
study documents relationships between Facebook’s elements, as evidenced in 
one sample of college students’ homepages. Third, the results demonstrate 
the seductive nature of the social networking website, Facebook, as well as its 
limitations (i.e., anonymity and relational goals). Finally, the study provides 
a warrant for future research on online social networking.

Chapter Two
Social Media and Persuasion: 
Crowdsourcing Arguments 
on Digital Networks
John Jones
In Persuasive Games, Bogost (2007) argues that video games operate by what 
he calls “procedural rhetoric,” that is, the argumentative and persuasive use 
of the procedures that are the building blocks of computer programs. While 
Bogost takes great pains to demonstrate the persuasive power of games, 
rhetoricians have traditionally viewed all communication as persuasive, even 
communication—such as art—that are not specifically designed to change 
a reader’s mind (Miller & Charney, 2007). What makes Bogost’s argument 
unique is his claim that, unlike other forms of communication, which pre-
sumably achieve their effects using similar techniques across various media, 
procedural rhetoric allows for the representation of processes with other pro-
cesses (2007, p. 14). According to Bogost, this unique form of representation 
makes procedural rhetoric distinct from other forms of inscription, forms 
which must generally represent processes in language.
Bogost (2007) further argues for the existence of distinct rhetorical effects 
related to procedural rhetoric, pointing out the differences between classical 
rhetorical theory and the needs of procedural persuasion. He notes that public 
discourse was the medium of Greek political decision-making as well as the 
foundation of the Greek justice system. Both rhetoric and rhetorical training 
grew from the need for young Greek men (and, on rare occasions, women) 
to learn how to create, shape, and deliver speeches that would persuade their 
fellow countrymen of the truthfulness of a particular course of action or judg-
ment. As such, the rhetoric that emerged from this instruction was a distinctly 
oral one, and it was dependent on the affordances of speech as a communica-
tion medium. While the persistence of many of the features of this rhetorical 
teaching into the medieval, renaissance, and modern eras suggests its vi-
ability and applicability to communication in other media, the practices of

John Jones
persuasion for oral communication cannot completely capture the unique rhe-
torical features of those media. Or, as Bogost puts it, “to address the possibili-
ties of a new medium as a type of rhetoric” it is necessary for rhetoricians to 
“identify how inscription works in that medium, and then how arguments can 
be constructed through those modes of inscription” (2007, p. 24). For Bogost, 
video games, based as they are on the procedures of computer programming, 
represent one such new medium, one which has fundamental effects on the 
artifacts, or inscriptions, created in that medium.
Following Bogost’s lead, the argument of this chapter is that persuasion 
relies on social connections and cultural assumptions that set the standards 
for what is considered correct or trustworthy, and that social media, particu-
larly social network sites, have unique rhetorical effects on persuasive acts. 
While it is possible to argue that networks, social or otherwise, have always 
influenced communication (Darnton, 1995), because of the ease with which 
social media articulate social networks (Boyd & Ellison, 2007), communica-
tion via social media is more susceptible to network effects and these effects 
create unique persuasive possibilities. Thus, this chapter is focused on the 
persuasive aspects of social media and the networks on which they operate, 
examining how the social and technical features of those media and networks 
influence the communication they enable. Because of the enormous impact 
of networks on societal and cultural development (Castells, 2000; Galloway 
& Thacker, 2007), social media represent a potentially new form of persua-
sive communication and one that needs to be addressed in new ways by new 
media and communication scholars.
THE ZUCKERBERG-LACY INTERVIEW
The data for this case study is comprised of the public Twitter messages 
sent during the keynote interview of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg by 
technology journalist Sarah Lacy at the 2008 South by Southwest Interactive 
Conference (SXSW). SXSW is a popular technology gathering, and often 
serves as a hub for launching new technology services. Twitter received its 
first large-scale public exposure at SXSW in 2007, where conference at-
tendees gleefully took to the service, encouraged by monitors throughout the 
convention center broadcasting the messages, or tweets, of attendees in real 
time (Douglas, 2007). Twitter’s popularity at SXSW was undoubtedly con-
nected to the conference’s history of encouraging attendees to provide real-
time feedback about the conference and presenters. This culture of audience 
feedback at SXSW, both through active audience feedback, such as audience 
members asking the presenters questions, and digital backchannels, is highly

25
entrenched. For example, at a SXSW session that the author attended in 2009, 
a member of the audience literally took over the panel—ascending the stage 
and assuming control of the discussion—after she perceived that the panel’s 
organizers were not going to cover the panel’s topic in the way she had an-
ticipated. While this is perhaps an extreme example, conference organizers 
regularly provide a mechanism whereby attendees could give feedback about 
panels while they are occurring. During the 2008 conference, official discus-
sions about individual panels were hosted on the online chat site Meebo, a 
third-party site that allows users to set up chat rooms wherein visitors can 
comment on a topic in a forum-like format, and instructions for how attendees 
could access these discussions were prominently displayed at each session.
Twitter, which combines the conversational features of chat, the connec-
tions of social network sites, and easy integration with mobile devices, was 
a perfect fit for the conference, allowing users to find like-minded individu-
als at the conference and engage in conversations with each other wherever 
they happened to be. Many attendees at the 2008 conference used Twitter as 
an unofficial backchannel, embracing its mobile features to comment about 
the conference in real time. By the time of the 2010 conference, Meebo had 
been completely replaced by Twitter, as organizers provided links to specific 
hashtags, or topics recognized by Twitter, for each panel, thereby coordi-
nating communications between users at the conference and non-attendees 
interested in the conference proceedings (Christine, 2010).
This culture of audience feedback is evident during the Zuckerberg-Lacy 
interview (“Mark Zuckerberg,” 2008), one of the most notorious examples 
of audience “revolt” at SXSW. Keynote sessions such as this one are promi-
nent features of SXSW, where they are held in large ballrooms and occupy 
prime time slots when few other panels are scheduled. The Zuckerberg-
Lacy interview attracted a large crowd, and vocal members of that crowd 
quickly grew frustrated with both Zuckerberg and Lacy’s performance dur-
ing the interview, expressing their dissatisfaction via Twitter and in vocal 
outbursts. This dissatisfaction eventually culminated in Lacy surrendering 
the interview to the audience, who spent the closing minutes of the session 
asking Zuckerberg questions.
DATA COLLECTION
The Twitter data referenced in this chapter consists of 3,562 messages sent 
between 3:00 p.m. and 4:11 p.m. EST on March 9, 2008. This data was col-
lected by Hinckley (2008) in March of 2008 via the Twitter application pro-
gramming interface (API). Out of these 3,562 messages, the author identified

John Jones
985 messages that directly or indirectly referenced the Zuckerberg-Lacy inter-
view. These messages, along with the video of the event (“Mark Zuckerberg 
keynote,” 2008), serve as the primary sources for the following analysis.
TWITTER
Twitter is a social medium that allows individuals to share short messages 
with a network of other users. As with other social network sites (Boyd & 
Ellison, 2007), Twitter users establish connections via the mechanism of 
following, and it appears that these users interact with each other in unique 
ways compared to other, similarly configured sites (Huberman, Romero, & 
Wu, 2009; Kwak, Lee, Park, & Moon, 2010). When someone follows another 
user on Twitter, his or her messages are displayed in a unified feed, or time-
line, which in 2008 was the site’s primary interface. In addition to the time-
line, Twitter users can initiate conversations through the use of @replies (i.e., 
@johnmjones) or through tagging their messages by placing a number sign, 
or hashtag, in front of a keyword or phrase (#SXSW).
With these tools—followed lists, @replies, and hashtags—Twitter users are 
able to monitor messages referencing particular topics as they appear on the 
network. There is evidence in the data set to suggest that users followed the 
Zuckerberg-Lacy interview backchannel in this way. For example, near the end 
of the interview, a user who goes by the name maslowbeer posted the following 
message, “had to remove my treo’s battery because i made the mistake of track-
ing #zuckerberg #sxsw and it became completely non-responsive,” indicating 
that this user was tracking the hashtags #zuckerberg and #sxsw during the in-
terview. (With a few exceptions, in this chapter Twitter users will be referred to 
by their usernames, and their messages will be presented as they are posted to 
the site, leaving typos and other grammatical oddities intact.) Like maslowbeer, 
mobilediner posted that he or she was “liking the live tweets from Zuckerberg 
keynote,” while ms_sloanev used an @reply to inform mjlambie that he or she 
would “give you highlights of Zuck keynote (if there are any).” In short, it is 
clear that individuals were using Twitter to track the interview, both by posting 
messages about the interview and actively seeking out similar posts from other 
users. This conversational use of the Twitter backchannel was the basis for the 
persuasive uses of Twitter during the interview.
PERSUASION ON SOCIAL MEDIA
Miller and Charney (2007) argue that writing has four unique effects when 
compared to oral communication: first, writing alters “the particularity of an

Social Media and Persuasion 
27
oral situation,” (p. 584) replacing it with the “decontextualized and universal-
ized space” (p. 584) of the text; second, it emphasizes logic over the direct 
persuasion of an audience, replacing what “an immediate audience is will-
ing to accept [with] what any rational hearer should accept” (p. 584); third, 
it “transforms an audience into readers” (p. 584) who must be addressed as 
a “decontextualized abstraction” (p. 584) rather than a particular group of 
individuals; and, finally, it “transforms performance into text” (p. 584). The 
argument of this chapter is that social media represents a hybrid of oral and 
written communication, demonstrating the features of both. Communication 
via social media often retains the particular nature of oral communication; 
for example, users of social networking sites frequently only interact with a 
small group of friends who they know offline (Boyd & Ellison, 2007), yet 
the fact that their messages are inscribed on such platforms make those mes-
sages susceptible to the “decontextualized and universalized space” (Miller 
& Charney, 2007, p. 584) of writing. In other words, the context in which a 
reader finds a particular text can be divorced from the context for which the 
author originally wrote it. In the case of Twitter, this could take the form of 
a user reading a tweet that was part of a larger conversation without the sur-
rounding messages that comprise the whole. While such a situation would 
not always lead to misunderstanding, it underscores the fact that written 
communication is subject to decontextualization in a way that oral speech 
is not. Similarly, communication via social media frequently addresses both 
particular groups prone to persuasion as well as the universalized, rational 
audience; it finds both an audience and readers; and it is both performance 
and text (for a discussion of the performative nature of digital communication 
see Brooke [2009, p. 176ff.]). By examining the tensions between the oral-
written binaries outlined by Miller and Charney, we can begin to understand 
some of the unique features of persuasion in social media networks.
Of course, this case study could be analyzed more traditionally. Zucker-
berg and Lacy can be said to have attempted to persuade their audience of a 
number of things: their worth as speakers; of individual arguments, such as 
Zuckerberg’s repeated insistence on Facebook’s value as a communication 
tool; or Lacy’s authority as a journalist. However, members of the audience 
were simultaneously attempting to influence each others’ opinions—and, 
crucially, Zuckerberg and Lacy—on these same topics. While Zuckerberg 
and Lacy were attempting to persuade the audience of their claims, mem-
bers of the audience presented rebuttals, counterclaims, personal and logical 
critiques, and occasionally support for those claims. Further complicating 
this interaction was the fact that while Zuckerberg and Lacy were perform-
ing their interview in a particular place for a specific audience, members 
of that audience were communicating with other readers and writers in the

networked space created by social media, relying on entirely different forms 
of persuasion. This complex series of interactions is characteristic of attempts 
at persuasion in social media. Within the space created by social technolo-
gies, the traditional presentation of simple oral performance is quickly being 
altered as all media are being represented in digital form and presented online. 
As Castells (2000) has argued, the dominant societal paradigm for power is 
the network, and any communication that cannot be expressed on the network 
quickly becomes irrelevant. If this is the case, communication made through 
social media like Twitter had a significant persuasive advantage over com-
munication that was not—the primary example of which is Zuckerberg and 
Lacy’s performance—and this led to the Twitter users being able to frame the 
discussion more or less without the input of either of the speakers. In short, 
social media operate by means of networks—digital and otherwise—and, as 
such, are dominated by the dialogic nature of these networks.
PARTICULAR AND DECONTEXTUALIZED SPACE
One unique feature of the networks that dominate social media like Twitter is 
their large scale. While communities have always shaped individual opinions, 
and certain powerful individuals have had the power to shape communities 
by virtue of their popularity or authority within those communities, the ability 
of hundreds of individuals to share opinions with each other in a large space 
in a short period of time is a recent development in communication, one fur-
thered by the asynchronous organizing features of tools like Twitter. Twitter 
allows large groups of persons to follow each others’ posts in an effective 
way, facilitating both individual interactions between users—via @replies 
and other specific messages—and many-to-many communication via public 
timelines and hashtag searches. In the case of the Zuckerberg-Lacy interview, 
this large-scale communication was in many ways particular, just as with oral 
communication. There was a particular audience present at the interview, be-
ing addressed by particular speakers at the same time. However, the re-pre-
sentation of the interview, both in real time via video to the overflow rooms 
and via Twitter and other backchannel communications, resulted in a com-
munication situation that was a hybrid of the particular and the decontextual-
ized. At any moment, Twitter users could be interacting with their individual 
social networks, with other attendees, or with Twitter users who were merely 
following the discussion of the interview as it unfolded online. On the one 
hand, the speakers were engaging in traditional oral speech, speech which, 
while it was being reproduced electronically in real time, was subject to the 
impermanence of sound: as Ong (1991) has noted, once something is said,

it is gone. Perhaps more critically, what was being said was inaccessible to 
Twitter users who were not present at the interview. Rather, those users relied 
on the Twitter discussion of the interview, which, because it was inscribed 
in the network, had a fixity that the oral performance lacked, making that 
network more permanent. Crucially, this permanence made those messages 
more persuasive to the audience. As if to underscore this effect, the interview 
was made available later in video form (“Mark Zuckerberg keynote,” 2008), 
and the fixity of that video possibly led to the altered reactions of individuals 
after the event (Hinckley, 2008; Scoble, 2008).
Many users found the written text on Twitter to be more palpable and im-
mediate than the real-time oral performance of Zuckerberg and Lacy that was 
occurring at the same time. User ryananderson observed that “the comments 
about the Zuckerberg interview are what I love about Twitter. Raw conversa-
tion. You don’t usu [sic] find that commentary on blogs.” And andykaufman 
claimed, “The twitter zuckchannel [sic] is 86x better than the actual keynote.” 
The idea that the Twitter stream implied “raw conversation,” or unfiltered 
information from Twitter users, seemed to be shared by most individuals who 
posted about the interview, giving the overall impression that they were ac-
cessing the audience zeitgeist. In other words, the Twitter conversation was 
more immediate, and therefore seemed to be a more authentic record of the 
event, than other forms of communication, such as blogs. In the comment 
above, andykaufman takes this idea further, claiming that the backchannel, 
or “zuckchannel,” was superior to the interview itself.
In other words, one notable effect of Twitter’s combination of particular 
and decontextualized space was that it led participants to believe that they 
were directly communicating with each other, receiving up-to-date infor-
mation about others’ reactions, even though these reactions lacked the im-
mediacy of oral communication. Unlike oral speech, these reactions were 
mediated by a number of technologies: the text used to communicate them; 
the mobile Twitter interfaces which slow down typing and lead to the abbre-
viations and typographical errors evident in the messages quoted here; and 
the Twitter infrastructure itself, as users sent messages to the service and then 
had those messages distributed to their followers and other users monitoring 
Twitter’s live stream. There were actual physical impediments to users ac-
cessing the Internet and cell phone networks that, somewhat paradoxically, 
were mentioned by Twitter users who had difficulty accessing the wireless 
network of the conference. In his attempt to sync Twitter messages to the 
video of the event, Hinckley (2008) found that some messages were posted 
up to fourteen minutes after the occurrence of the event about which they 
were commenting. He eventually adjusted all of the messages by five minutes 
in order to account for the delay between when a user wrote a message and

when it appeared on the network. The phenomenon of immediacy associated 
with this social media was clearly one that was not tied to the timeliness of 
the messages sent on the network, yet it easily trumped the immediacy of the 
two speakers’ performances.
This melding of the particular and immediate with the universal and decon-
textualized is a feature of social media that is facilitated by networking tech-
nology. One of the chief failures of Zuckerberg and Lacy was their inability 
to connect with this social network, and a particular feature of this lack of 
connection was the paradoxical sense that, rather than being immediate, as is 
typical of oral interactions, their communications were perceived as being re-
mote. Because of the particularity of their discussion, they could not hope to 
compete with the network that was both particular in its focus on the users of 
social media and the audience attending the interview and decontextualized—
and, therefore, able to be replicated to other, non-particular audiences—in its 
embodiment on the network.
PERSUASION AND LOGIC
It should seem obvious, given the audience’s reaction, that Zuckerberg and 
Lacy failed to persuade their audience: of their abilities as speakers, the im-
portance of their communication, and so on. After the interview, Lacy herself 
suggested that this was due to their having misjudged the audience, suggest-
ing that the interview had focused on Facebook as a business while the audi-
ence was primarily composed of software developers who were interested 
in Facebook’s technical details (Gallaga, 2008). Placed against their failure 
to persuade this particular audience were the numerous critiques of Zucker-
berg and Lacy by the members of the Twitter network, many of which were 
presented as logical refutations of the speakers’ claims. While the audience 
critique featured a substantial number of personal attacks on the speakers, the 
many logical critiques of their claims were often overlooked by commenta-
tors (Hinckley, 2008; Scoble, 2008), and these critiques played a role in the 
audience being persuaded of their overall failure.
Twitter is not generally known as a place for logical disputation, and the 
size limitations of Twitter messages place strong restrictions on the type of 
content that they can carry. Twitter messages are restricted to 140 characters 
or less, a requirement that was originally adopted to make it possible to send 
and receive Twitter messages using cell phone SMS networks. Because of 
this restriction, it is difficult to sustain prolonged argument, particularly syl-
logistic or enthymematic arguments that depend on multiple argumentative 
moves and the citation of evidence. While Twitter users have demonstrated

the service’s ability to share facts like breaking news (Kwak et al., 2010; 
Makice, 2009, p. 27), the affordances of Twitter—from its message length, to 
the lack of persistence of conversation trees—makes sustained, reasoned ar-
gument using the service difficult. Despite these restrictions, however, some 
of the messages in the data set took the form of traditional logical structures 
such as enthymemes, albeit very simple ones. For example, Systim wrote, 
“the zuckerburg interview at SXSW is terrible. The interviewer is LAME”. 
Why is the interview “terrible”? Because Lacy is “LAME.”
A more common appearance of logical argumentation directed at a univer-
sal audience centered, not surprisingly, around the claims made by Zucker-
berg and Lacy in the interview. In one case, Zuckerberg argued that Facebook 
allowed for anti-government guerrillas in Colombia to communicate, thereby 
providing an important, extra-national means of interaction between mem-
bers of these groups. In response, Brad_King asked, “Zuckerberg’s assertion, 
Facebook helping Columbians rebel against the government, may be true—
but no news stories that I found. Anyone?” Soon after, Zuckerberg made the 
claim that social problems, such as terrorism, were both caused and exacer-
bated by poor communication, asserting that Facebook could help solve such 
communication problems. This prompted jason_pontin to respond, “Zucker-
berg is claiming, very improbably, that terrorism is caused by inefficiencies 
in communication—which FB can *fix*”, while ceedub added “Facebook. 
The answer to terrorism. Yup.” Messages like these show a clear interest by 
some audience members in the content of the talk, as well as in whether or 
not the claims and evidence being presented by Zuckerberg and Lacy were 
accurate. The oral modality of the interview privileged a loose conversation, 
but the written hybrid modality of Twitter demanded evidence that was not 
forthcoming. The specifically persuasive responses of the audience are also 
available on Twitter in the memes that developed during the interview.
AUDIENCE AND READERS
As it was previously pointed out, one of the features of text is that it is always 
present, while oral speech is not. That is, text has a permanence that oral 
speech cannot attain. The Zuckerberg-Lacy interview is unique as a social 
media case study in that the participants were both members of a traditional 
audience as well as readers and writers participating in a social network. This 
audience was a constant theme of the Twitter network, as numerous Twitter 
users noted the reactions of the audience during the interview. For example, 
early on in the interview, kdando wrote: “Interviewer asks about Zucker-
berg’s tendency to fire execs. Audience member in my row asks ‘Can we fire

John Jones
*you* from this session?’” Similarly, after Zuckerberg responded to one of 
Lacy’s questions with a mildly snarky response, shane posted, “YES!!! Zuck 
just nailed her and the audience clapped for a minute!” These messages, and 
others like them, helped to reinforce the sense of some Twitter users that 
the speakers’ performance was being universally derided by members of the 
physical audience. While Miller and Charney (2007), following Ong (1991), 
point out that audiences of oral performances are “a present and participating 
collectivity” while readers of texts “are a distant and fragmented plurality” 
(p. 584), in this case a significant portion of the audience was both. This dual 
status of many audience members led to the interesting result of the “distant 
and fragmented plurality” of readers becoming instead a largely unified group 
that accepted the proposition that the interview was itself a failure and spread 
this proposition to others not in attendance at the event. As the reactions to 
the interview on Twitter became more extreme—and the audience reveled in 
their role as commentators criticizing the speakers—this led to a feedback 
loop, a kind of group identification in which the audience joined in solidarity 
against Zuckerberg and Lacy in particular.
Because Zuckerberg and Lacy failed to intervene, or even merely interact, 
with the backchannel, their silence served to reinforce this “us versus them” 
mentality. The “participating collectivity” (Miller & Charney, 2007, p. 584) 
of the audience used the powerful writing tools available to them in the form 
of the social network to express their discontent. For example, after an audi-
ence outburst in which one audience member shouted, “Beacon sucks!” at 
the stage—a critique of a failed, widely derided Facebook advertising ven-
ture—the audience member who yelled posted to Twitter, “He [Zuckerberg] 
comes to SXSW interactive. He should expect an interactive keynote. Sorry 
if I offend, but not really all that sorry.” Like this user, many members of the 
audience expected an interactive keynote, and because that was not what they 
were presented with (and because they were so unhappy with what they did 
get), they revolted against the speakers, using Twitter as the primary means 
by which they identified with each other in opposition to them.
PERFORMANCE AND TEXT
The majority of the critiques leveled against Zuckerberg and Lacy in the 
interview were critiques of their performance. In Zuckerberg’s case, prior to 
the interview he was widely considered by Twitter users to be a poor speaker, 
and this impression was not altered by his interview performance. Before the 
interview began, technosailor posted the following message to Twitter: “Key-
note packed. Folks, Zuck is not that great of a speaker! Now gimme your

Social Media and Persuasion 
33
seat.” While the final sentence suggests the author was being a bit tongue-in-
cheek, the idea that Zuckerberg was a generally poor public communicator 
was one that was held by a number of members of the technology community. 
This perception developed in the negative reaction to an interview Zucker-
berg had given on 60 Minutes in early 2008 and, even earlier, a blog post he 
wrote (Zuckerberg, 2006) responding to the public outcry that surrounded 
the company’s debut of the “News Feed” feature in 2006. In discussing the 
60 Minutes interview, one technology writer described Zuckerberg as be-
ing “robotic” and having delivered “canned” responses (Riley, 2008). Even 
though technosailor was likely making a joke about Zuckerberg’s not being 
“that great of a speaker,” the joke was rooted in a widely held perception of 
Zuckerberg as being a poor communicator.
In light of this perception of the Facebook founder, it is not surprising 
that while some individuals posted messages to Twitter positively describing 
Zuckerberg’s performance, the majority of descriptions supported the view 
that his performance during the interview was poor. For example, when the 
then 23-year-old Zuckerberg first took the stage, agentdero wrote, “Zucker-
burg has the stage presence of a normal 20-something. Ick.” Similarly, an-
guslogan described the experience by noting, “I couldnt feel more awkward 
right now.” Additionally, in line with Riley’s (2008) complaints about Zuck-
erberg’s robotic delivery, audience members frequently criticized the young 
CEO’s repeated use of particular words when answering Lacy’s questions. 
These complaints tended to cluster around his repeated use of words like 
“empathy” and the phrase “communicate effectively”—“Tired of the word 
empathy” & “say empathy one more time, I dare you”—and his on-stage 
appearance—“zuckerberg looks like he is always scared to me” & “Z seems 
pretty nervous.” In short, rightly or wrongly, Zuckerberg brought with him 
the perception that he was a poor communicator, and most members of the 
audience—as represented by the comments in the Twitter stream—saw no 
reason to challenge that perception.
In fact, the Twitter audience’s negative reaction to Zuckerberg only ta-
pered off when they found a new target: his interviewer Sarah Lacy. Lacy 
is a business and technology reporter who, prior to the interview, had been 
profiling Zuckerberg for a book on web startups and the entrepreneurs who 
founded them. While she did not carry with her the baggage that Zuckerberg 
had coming into the interview, the crowd quickly turned on her as well. 
Timothompson posted that the “Moderator is a cackling annoyatron,” while 
RichardAult added that the experience was like “watching gossip columnist 
interview teenage wunderkind.” User sunrisedesign claimed “this leslie 
chick is awful” while ceonyc summed up the experience as “Sarah Lacey: 
FAIL.” As the interview progressed, critiques of Lacy took a different turn, as

John Jones
audience members criticized her for “flirting” with Zuckerberg, or, as user 
rk crudely put it, “It seems that Sarah lacy has a b**** for zuckerberg.”
In these examples, the performances of Zuckerberg and Lacy are quite 
literally opposed by the written critiques of their audience, an audience that 
was encouraged by other Twitter users enjoying the spectacle created by their 
critique. It also served to encourage Twitter users who were not physically 
present but were following messages about the event to believe that this nar-
rative of the event was the only one, or the most viable one. This reaction 
came despite the fact that some users expressed interest in the interview 
and support for the interviewers on Twitter; however, these more positive 
messages were dwarfed by those supporting the dominant narrative that the 
interview was going poorly. This reaction was a source of enjoyment for 
some users, like timoni, who wrote, “Just started following ‘Zuckerberg,’ and 
am highly, highly amused by the Twitters that have followed. Almost wish I 
was at the keynote, now.” Similarly, arielwaldman wrote, “were all LOLing 
at reading off the tweets from the Zuckerberg roast.” In light of this fact, it 
would be somewhat simplistic to say that these two modes—oral perfor-
mance and text—were completely independent of each other. As mentioned 
in the previous section, the video of the session that was later posted online 
led to Zuckerberg and Lacy’s oral performance attaining a permanence simi-
lar to the text of the audience’s critique, and this videotext does serve as a 
counterpoint to the claims made by attendees during the interview (Hinckley, 
2008). Lacy in particular was able to respond to the claims made against her, 
although her response seemed to only make the audience turn on her more 
(Gallaga, 2008). Further, there are significant reasons to think that the partici-
pants on Twitter were also performing as they critiqued the speakers. While it 
has been argued that all communication is in some way performative (Austin, 
1975; Butler, 1997), it is clear that Twitter users who were not present at the 
interview were actively following the reaction of attendees on Twitter, some-
times encouraging those attendees in their harsh critiques of the speakers. If 
all communication is inherently performative, what social media services like 
Twitter add to textual and written communication is the immediacy (or the 
sense of immediacy) inherent in oral performance.
Miller and Charney (2007) make the following two claims as to how writ-
ing alters the dynamic between audience and speaker established by oral 
performance. First, they claim that “text fixes meaning in . . . that discourse 
ceases to be an event” but rather “becomes a proposition,” and, second, citing 
Ricoeur (1981), they state that “written text dissociates propositional mean-
ing from authorial intention,” allowing it to “achiev[e] a kind of autonomy” 
(p. 584). They argue, then, that oral performance is “an event” and the mean-
ing of that event is attached to “authorial intention,” or the speaker’s will

to communicate. This characterization is placed against writing, which is 
propositional and disconnected from the intentions of the author in that it can 
be read or otherwise consumed independently of its author once the text is 
inscribed. Social media combine these effects, mingling the immediate—or 
the feeling that one is witnessing an event that is directly connected to a par-
ticular speaker or speakers—with the propositional. This leaves social media 
users with the impression that the propositions in question are doubly true, by 
virtue of their being both immediate and permanent.
This combination of immediacy and permanence is detectable in the cri-
tique of Lacy’s interviewing techniques by the Twitter audience. Audience 
members were convinced that she was not interviewing Zuckerberg well, and 
this opinion is evident in a message by eng1ne, in which he or she tells Lacy, 
“FEEL THE ROOM. THEY HATE THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ASK-
ING.” Similarly, after an outburst from the audience, thinkkesho observed, 
“guy in crowd screams to lacey ‘talk about something interesting’ crowd 
goes wild again.” As more and more attendees expressed similar opinions 
via Twitter, the collection of messages assumed a propositional reality that, 
for these users and those following their tweets, completely defined Lacy’s 
performance. If one was not convinced that Lacy was doing a bad job, the evi-
dence to the contrary was readily available on Twitter from these individuals, 
who, by virtue of the timeliness of their reactions, were easily considered au-
thorities on the subject. Because Zuckerberg and Lacy’s performances were 
divorced from the text of the Twitter conversation, they could not compete 
with this critique of their performance.
CONCLUSION
In this chapter, the author examined the audience reaction as a series of per-
suasive acts, acts that were heavily influenced by the use of Twitter and its 
social networking features. In examining the Twitter messages sent during 
the keynote, the author showed how the opinions of audience members about 
the interview were altered, culminating in the eventual “revolt,” and how this 
process was influenced by the unique combination of oral and written com-
munication present on social media like Twitter.
In one sense, the strong, visceral reactions to Zuckerberg and Lacy that 
were expressed in many messages in the data set are puzzling when viewing 
video of the interview (“Mark Zuckerberg keynote,” 2008). While Zucker-
berg does repeat certain phrases, he does not come across as being especially 
awkward, and the basis for the extreme comments about Lacy’s behavior—
rk’s statement, “It seems that Sarah lacy has a b**** for zuckerberg,” is one

of the least profane of many offensive remarks made about Lacy by the audi-
ence—are not immediately apparent. For this reason, it is difficult to attribute 
these responses to traditional forms of persuasion. Where did the impression 
that Lacy was flirting, or that Zuckerberg was awkward originate? An easy 
answer is that they originated in the audience, the “audience of Twittering 
a*******,” as one blogger later described them (Scoble, 2008). As this au-
thor has argued, these results were in many cases attributable to the unique 
features of social media, which, in this case, combined the features of oral and 
written communication by means of networking technology. Zuckerberg and 
Lacy, by virtue of their failing to address this new form of communication, 
were utterly unable to persuade the audience—or those monitoring the event 
from afar—of the worthiness of their message. In their combination of the 
characteristics of oral and written communication, it is possible to argue that 
social media present a new forum for persuasion. Social media are both par-
ticular and universal, allowing for direct, timely interactions between users 
while also preserving those interactions just as writing preserves communica-
tion. Social media are both specifically persuasive, in that they deal with an 
immediate audience, and also susceptible to the logical claims of the univer-
sal, rational audience. Because Zuckerberg and Lacy failed to persuade their 
immediate audience, it was relatively easy for that audience to be convinced 
of the rational (and irrational) claims written in the Twitter network. Social 
media also erase the distinctions between audiences with readers, again mix-
ing the particular with the universal. Finally, social media are both performa-
tive and propositional, combining the features of oral performance with the 
permanence of textual output and the seeming solidity that this permanence 
lends to communication.
This study suggested two possible conclusions with regard to persua-
sion via social media. First, the combination of oral and written features 
of social media force the user to focus on both the particular features of a 
communication situation—such as who the individual participants are and 
what they might find persuasive—as well as the universal, rational features 
of that situation. By failing to either connect with their physical audience or 
be convincing to a universal audience, Zuckerberg and Lacy were unable to 
successfully persuade the attendees of their keynote interview. Perhaps the 
most significant result of this study is the introduction of a question: how 
can users of social media deal with the needs of both particular and universal 
audiences? Second, this study suggests that in order for communicators to 
be effective they must address social media as social media. If a complaint 
or argument is made in a social media environment, often the best response 
will be made in that same environment. A significant way in which Zucker-
berg and Lacy failed to establish credibility with the audience was that they

ignored the backchannel created by audience members. Rather than engag-
ing with the audience—who, as it has been pointed out, were accustomed to 
discussing panels and providing feedback about them during SXSW events—
Lacy and Zuckerberg essentially ignored them, choosing not to follow the 
backchannel as the interview occurred. A social media ethos is one that is 
dialogic; that is, one that is willing to engage with other users conversation-
ally. If Lacy or Zuckerberg had been following this backchannel, they would 
have been aware of, and perhaps able to counteract, the negative claims be-
ing made about their performances. In fact, it seems likely that Lacy would 
have responded well to the Twitter audience’s concerns. When the members 
of the audience vocally complained about her interview style, she seemed 
genuinely shocked that the audience was upset and immediately surrendered 
the floor to audience questions. If this intervention had been made earlier in 
the interview, it is possible that the interview would not be remembered as a 
“Fail” but rather as one of many SXSW panels that followed the wishes of its 
audience in presenting information.

The Trivial Pursuits of Mass 
Audiences Using Social Media: A 
Content Analysis of Facebook Wall 
Posts by Fans of Top-Trending 
Television Programs
Douglas A. Ferguson
Consumers of mass media have always used their experience and interpre-
tations as topics to engage other fans and friends. This function of media 
consumption is called conversation currency (Deragon, 2009). The better 
informed viewers are of a particular element of the mass media, the more 
they have to spend and the more credibility they obtain. Fans of television 
programs thus use their knowledge of shows to back up their interpretive 
claims. For example, followers of Star Trek reruns assert their opinions in 
the context of their own immersion in often-trivial facts about individual 
episodes. To a lesser degree, fans of any television program express their 
opinions and interpretations.
Interpretations take many different forms. The simplest claims fall along 
the lines of approval/disapproval. Casual conversations are filled with as-
sertions that a show or a particular episode is the best to the worst. Entire 
shows are cast as brilliant or awful, based on interpretations of actors, scripts, 
production quality, or plot outcomes. An example of such claims might be 
enacted with extreme conversational assertions (e.g., “that show stinks” or 
“it’s clearly the best show ever”).
The forum for discussions of the mass media was initially centered on 
face-to-face interactions, sometimes referred to as water-cooler conversation, 
but more accurately as interpretive communities (Ang, 1985; Fish, 1980). 
Popular television shows most often air in prime time, between 8:00 p.m. 
and 11:00 p.m. (EST). For decades, these shows competed in a three-network 
circus and audiences went to work the next day and found others willing to 
discuss their previous evening’s tele-viewing. With the arrival of cable tele-
vision, these conversations diminished somewhat as the competitive options 
grew. Still, a safe mass media topic (one that steered clear of sex, politics and

religion) was television, including televised sports. Researchers have studied 
such interpersonal conversations, sometimes to understand the parasocial 
functions of the media (Schiappa, Gregg, & Hewes, 2005).
With the advent of online communication, however, discussion of mass 
media in general and television programming in particular expanded to fan 
web pages or discussion groups devoted to conversation about a program or 
genre of programs (Baym, 2000; Jenkins, 1992, 2006). Working in the same 
building or waiting until the next family gathering was no longer necessary 
to make interpretive claims about popular culture (Isaacs, 1995). Qualitative 
research of such sites includes Beatty (2006), Clark (2008), Godlewski and 
Perse (2007), and Kozlowski (2005).
Blogging is another mechanism for online discussions (Gregg, 2006). 
Not only does an individual audience member have a voice, but those who 
visit and comment on messages posted on blogs are active discussants of the 
mass media. The successor to formal blogs is microblogging such as Twitter, 
where communities follow one another. Facebook changed its wall (where 
acquaintances share public messages), in 2009, to imitate Twitter. Aside 
from the friend-versus-stranger difference, the functional difference between 
Facebook and Twitter is small, although game-playing (e.g., Farmville) con-
tributes to its time-passing gratification and total use.
Social networking has greatly expanded the opportunity of people to con-
nect with family, friends, and acquaintances. The general nature of sites like 
Facebook and Twitter makes conversations about television programs more 
likely without joining a particular discussion group. Social networking is thus 
more like the water cooler than an online discussion board (Hsia, 2010).
The influence of social media on old media like television became a hot 
topic in 2010. Most of the discussion has centered on the use of Twitter by 
television viewers (Parr, 2010; Tsotsis, 2010), but Facebook is the dominant 
social medium and considered more influential among participants. Twit-
ter specializes in strangers whom one can follow, but Facebook focuses on 
acquaintances, broadly called “friends.” Interpersonal networks are presum-
ably more salient to participants because comments are more often judged 
for their validity. Social networking seems to be reversing a trend toward 
asynchronous viewing. Fans of live programs connect with one another, us-
ing social media, thus re-making television a must-see event (Becker, 2010). 
Only a few years ago, digital video recorders (DVRs) like TiVo persuaded 
viewers to take control of their viewing choices. One of the guiding questions 
for this study was how people have begun to share their viewing, particularly 
as it unfolds in a live setting. Thus, this study chose to examine Facebook, 
although re-tweeted Twitter posts sometimes appear on Facebook walls, as-

suming any given user wants to share all of his or her streamed thoughts. The 
primary goal of this study was to describe how people use social media to 
discuss dominant mass media, but additional efforts were made to explain/
understand online behaviors in the realm of social media. Because of the 
exploratory nature of social media research, a qualitative textual analysis was 
used to analyze a purposive sample of Facebook posts related to top-trending 
television shows and their main characters and/or themes.
LITERATURE REVIEW
A limited number of studies have examined television-viewing behavior in 
relation to social media behavior (e.g., Stefanone, Lackaff, and Rosen, 2010). 
Even before social media, Reeves and Nass (1996) anticipated the link be-
tween new media and old media. Boyd and Ellison (2007) initially staked out 
the domain of inquiry for social networking sites (SNSs).
Social media research has often focused on motivations for using these 
systems. For example, studies about Facebook have found that maintain-
ing contact with friends is one of the primary reasons for using the system 
(Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007; Sheldon, 2008). Similar findings were 
noted by Urista, Dong and Day (2009) in research about MySpace and Face-
book usage. Among other findings, they noted that users viewed the social 
networks as a convenient and efficient way to reinforce relationships and to 
share information quickly to many individuals.
Radio and television stations have experimented with social media as a 
way of connecting with audiences. Ferguson and Greer (2011) found that 
only a weak correlation between radio stations’ audience size and the number 
of followers of stations’ Twitter sites. Greer and Ferguson (2011) examined 
television stations’ use of Twitter in a separate study that revealed stations 
that offered news items seldom also promoted their regular newscasts, with 
overall Twitter use not being used to drive viewers to the station’s on-air pro-
gramming. Both of these studies, however, focused on the media reaching out 
to listeners and viewers, without much regard to feedback from the audience.
No previous scholarly studies have tracked messages posted by broad-
cast audience members, but research in related fields has been undertaken. 
Metzgar and Maruggi (2009) used Radian6, a social media tracking tool, 
to identify the major topics of conversation on social media sites during the 
2008 presidential campaign. Their findings compared how much each candi-
date appeared on traditional media and social media, but no qualitative study 
of messages was undertaken.

Another area of previous research involves the amount of self-disclosure 
as a predictor of social media use. Ledbetter, Mazer, DeGroot, Meyer, Mao, 
and Swafford (2011) found an interaction effect between self-disclosure 
and social connection directly predicting Facebook communication and 
indirectly predicting relational closeness. Friends on social media make 
evaluations of one another based on messages posted on Facebook (Wal-
ther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, & Tong, 2008). Research on social 
media and SNSs is evolving to keep up with developing trends, but work 
thus far is more exploratory than definitive, especially with regard to grati-
fications of television viewers.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were limited to those members of Facebook whose privacy 
settings permitted search engines to view their walls, where status updates 
are publicly revealed. The resulting sample was self-selected simply by 
virtue of each person choosing to participate in a semi-private forum. After 
accounting for multiple messages from the same people, the number of par-
ticipants was 1,198. The participants did not directly consent to the study. 
They willingly posted messages to their walls, perhaps unaware that their 
privacy settings were set sufficiently low enough to permit Openbook (a 
web engine) to retrieve their often-mundane thoughts. Their names were 
recorded along with the messages they shared, but all materials were kept 
confidential. One could argue that they made their thoughts public, but it 
seemed ethical to protect their identities anyway, in case they were un-
aware. In all likelihood, they did not care who saw their messages or photos. 
Social media are predicated on a threshold for self-disclosure that seems 
very loosely connected to privacy.
Starting in 2009, the contents of Facebook users’ wall postings have 
become searchable through web engines such as Openbook, located on the 
Internet at http://youropenbook.org (Heussner, 2010; Smith, 2009). Not ev-
eryone who uses Facebook is aware, apparently, that their words are seen by 
people outside their circle of acquaintances (which is the raison d’etre for 
Openbook). Facebook wall postings (status updates) served as the unit of 
analysis in this study, but the textual data that comprise the sampled messages 
does not exist separately from the search that produces the data. This study 
used Openbook to explore the viewpoints of the participants, based on their 
generic reactions to all programs on the Fall 2010 network prime-time lineup 
and to five specific programs.

Programs
This study examined the wall postings of several Facebook pages that men-
tioned new and/or popular prime-time shows in October 2010. Show titles 
were chosen to reflect debut, mainstream, and established programs across a 
variety of broadcast networks: Hellcats (CW), Hawaii Five-0 (CBS), Danc-
ing with the Stars (ABC), Outsourced (NBC), and Glee (FOX). Some of 
these shows are scripted and include one situation comedy (Outsourced), two 
performance-based dramas (Hellcats and Glee), and one performance reality 
format (Dancing with the Stars). Choosing popular or brand-new shows was 
the purpose in this study; dealing with performance themes was happen-
stance. Collecting data is not as difficult as analyzing it, but some raise the 
issue of bias (Winslow, 2010). None of the television programs studied here 
were favorites of the researcher engaged in interpretation.
Titles with ambiguous meanings were included despite their double-
meaning. Thus, the NBC debut program Outsourced was sufficiently generic 
that comments using that word sometimes referred to something else and 
had to be discarded. On the other hand, Fox’s popular program Glee easily 
uncovered comments specific to the show, suggesting the word itself (much 
like the word gay) has come to mean something unintended fifty years ago. 
Initials were useful for locating shorthand comments (e.g., DWTS for Danc-
ing with the Stars).
As indicated earlier, general comments about new fall shows were searched 
and interpreted. This strategy permitted generic wall posts that might apply 
to programs not included among the chosen five or to programming in gen-
eral. For decades, television viewers have been conditioned to expect fresh 
programming each fall, which is one justification for the time frame in the 
present study.
The process of sorting the comments by participant’s Facebook “user 
name” produced an indicator of how large the sample of posts was: Danc-
ing with the Stars (190), Glee (225), Hawaii Five-0 (193), Hellcats (211), 
Outsourced (231), and “new fall shows” (194), for a total of 1,207 messages 
from 1,198 different people. Some messages were originally Twitter mes-
sages repurposed onto the participant’s Facebook wall. Thus, over 1,200 wall 
posts were read, sorted, and interpreted. The apparent limit for each search of 
the six performed was roughly 200 messages, perhaps a function of how the 
search is programmed by someone at Openbook.
Nearly all messages were in English. A dozen or so wall posts in another 
language, usually Spanish or Japanese, were discarded. Although gender 
and age were not coded, the stream of messages came from a wide variety 
of people, national origin, and demographic category. Young people were 
sometimes displayed with drinks in their hands or posed provocatively.

Some people used a logo instead of a photograph, or showed their dog or 
cat, or a cartoon image. Even so, the Openbook website captured the gen-
der, if made public on a Facebook profile, using a male or female symbol 
(♂ or ♀). The most disturbing image was a young man pointing an auto-
matic weapon at the lens.
Procedure
Openbook (youropenbook.org) was thus employed to collect publicly search-
able messages from private accounts. Most self-reported demographic data 
are typically anonymous among privacy-conscious Facebook users, although 
photos (forwarded by Openbook) can be interpreted for age, gender, and 
sometimes social group. As indicated earlier, Openbook is intended to raise 
consciousness regarding privacy, but it makes a useful research tool for social 
media research in the meantime.
Entering the search terms one at a time into Openbook generated the six 
textualized lists of comments (available from the author). Analyzing and 
interpreting participant’s status updates was done qualitatively to identify 
emergent themes within messages on the walls of Facebook users. For ex-
ample, posted messages occasionally included YouTube links to clips within 
programs, sometimes far in excess of making simple evaluative comments. In 
addition to qualitative textual analysis, this study considered the relationship 
between themes and photo-identifiable demographics.
The constant comparative method (Lindlof & Taylor, 2002) was used to 
sort the themes and sub-themes described below. After capturing each stream 
of comments in September and October 2010, the file was printed out and 
then cut into strips of paper (including the color Facebook photo for most 
messages) that were manually sorted into piles on a large workspace. Each 
item was interpreted by finding similarities and differences between items, 
which is an iterative process that continues until saturation is reached (i.e., 
to the greatest possible understanding of the identified themes and to the 
researcher’s conviction that adding more participants or messages would not 
add any new understanding). Sometimes deeper piles of comments started 
as several related piles. Other times, smaller piles were combined into larger 
piles to help identify dominant themes.
The method itself allows greater analytic flexibility than other techniques, 
in part because the tradition has diverged over the years. The earliest descrip-
tion of the constant comparative method appeared in the work of Glaser and 
Strauss (1967), who used it to describe grounded theory. Grounded theory 
is an inductive approach where the researcher systematically and repeatedly 
gathers and analyzes field data. The repetition of comparison lies at the heart

The Trivial Pursuits of Mass Audiences Using Social Media

of the term constant comparative, with the end result being an explanation 
grounded in the data.
Glaser and Strauss later disagreed on the method and published different 
works on how it should be done (Strauss, 1987; Glaser, 1992). A subse-
quent textbook by Strauss and Corbin (1990) became a training manual for 
a newer generation of researchers trained in qualitative methods that were 
often unaccepted in communication journals even a decade before. Other 
scholars molded the method to their own purposes, but the underlying struc-
ture involved open coding (the process whereby most of the comparisons 
take place) as the first step. The sorting technique described above, using 
strips of paper, was widely taught in universities in the 1980s, until the 
appearance of software programs that reduced the manual labor. Given the 
relatively small population of postings, the manual method was employed 
in this study.
RESULTS
For the most part, ordinary people shared their feelings or opinions as private 
individuals. Notable exceptions were those who participated in campaign-
driven comments linking to tvguide.com, tv.com, ustream.tv, ABC.com, 
local newscast anchors, or their own Internet-only blog. Most of these 
comments include video clips from various programs. It was impossible to 
discern whether comments were encouraged by the sites that warehouse the 
clips. Most commercial websites have links directly to Facebook. Presumably 
someone who views clips is more likely to share comments in such situations, 
because of the encouragement.
Nearly all comments could be framed as positive such as “cant wait for 
Glee <33” or negative as “If you like Glee, you are wrong.” Even emotion-
ally neutral comments (for example “Glee is new tonight”) seemed somewhat 
positive. Some people simply said that they were “watching [show title]” or 
asking “has anyone seen [show title]?” Negative comments were numerous 
but definitely in the minority, often reflecting disappointment or taking a 
cynical view of the television industry as “Whoever greenlit Outsourced is 
really, really dumb.”
New Fall Shows
Several themes emerged from a close textual analysis of the wall postings. 
First, a sense of excitement captured the positive messages on Facebook. A 
good example is “Ready for new shows this week!! This week new fall series 

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
46 
Douglas A. Ferguson
begins!!! Here comes fall!!!” Thus, enthusiasm about watching new shows 
in the fall emerged as the dominant theme. Mostly the enthusiasm was in the 
form of a declaration, about half of which mentioned one or more specific 
shows that were enjoyed, but sometimes the comment was framed as a ques-
tion to elicit responses. For example, someone wrote “The fall t.v. season is 
underway. What new shows have you checked out and which ones do you 
like and returning shows are you excited about?” Asking questions, however, 
was not nearly as common as sharing a statement. When specific shows were 
mentioned, enthusiasm was absent about a third of the time.
A second theme was mentioning the use of a DVR (or TiVo) to assist in 
the viewing of new shows. One person wrote “WOW Aren’t lots of the new 
shows this fall just fabulous? Hard to decide what to watch ~ I just DVR them 
and watch them when I can.” That quite a few people included their viewing 
technique was a contrast to the playful nature of their enjoyment, although 
these comments were nearly universally positive.
A third theme was the context of television in people’s unmediated lives. 
Many of the people making Facebook comments framed their TV viewing 
as part of their other activities that they listed. A few suggested that the op-
portunity to see new programming lifted their spirits or sense of well-being, 
even in the face of illness or stress. One posting read “. . . call me a loser, 
call me old, or call me pathetic. WHATEVER!! The new fall shows make 
me happy!!!”
A contrasting theme was a sense of disappointment and anger with new 
viewing options. These messages made negative claims, with frequent criti-
cisms of shows. Disdain for a program was usually stated in a clever manner, 
indicating that the person making the negative comment was more entertain-
ing than the program being attacked. For example, a twenty-something male 
posted: “The order in which I will listen to a song. Original artist, acoustic 
version, tone deaf car singer, Glee.”
Specific Programs
Regardless the particular show, some postings fell under the “watching [show 
name]” variety, sharing an activity under Facebook’s original “what are you 
doing right now?” theme that replaced the “what’s on your mind” theme 
(likely in response to the growing popularity of Twitter). As such, knowing 
that someone is watching a show could just as easily be eating a sandwich 
or playing with the dog. The addition of an exclamation mark denoted some 
excitement and occasionally people would overdo the punctuation.
Hawaii Five-O. The dominant theme of these wall postings was enjoyment. 
Some just posted the name of the show without further comment, but that it-

The Trivial Pursuits of Mass Audiences Using Social Media 
47
self could be interpreted as enthusiasm, with the enjoyment understood. Far 
fewer negative comments were encountered. Even fewer postings attempted 
to engage the reader in a response by asking a question. One subtheme was 
missing Hawaii and wishing to return to Hawaii, which were feelings likely 
generated by the show’s images. An example was a young woman: “Watch-
ing Hawaii Five-0 makes me really want to go back to Hawaii :).” A second 
theme was the program’s emblematic music intro recorded in the 1960s by 
The Ventures. At least a dozen people posted YouTube links to the video 
and audio. Other clips from the earlier version of Hawaii Five-0 were linked 
to YouTube by fans of the show. A third theme was locale and localism. 
Judging from the names and photos, Hawaiians themselves were excited 
with the program. Some linked to clips of themselves or relatives in small 
roles. A few people used local jargon (e.g., “cheeehuuu,” which means ex-
citement). Another young man posted: “HAWAII FIVE-0 filming across my 
work place . . . Cool . . . Haha.” Also, a Honolulu newspaper (staradvertiser.
com) cross-promoted the program and episodes on its Facebook wall, often 
tied to a variety of news stories about the show. At least a half-dozen video 
websites linked clips of episodes: tvsquad.com, imdb.com, tv.com, cbs.com, 
among others. At the time of the study, CBS was promoting a marching band 
competition (“Marching Band Mania”) featuring schools that showcased the 
show’s theme song.
Outsourced. The dominant theme was enjoyment, greatly outnumbering 
negative comments. A handful of Facebook users wondered if the show 
was racist (usually deciding it was funny anyway), but the substantial fan 
base with Indian-sounding names would not suggest the show is offensive 
to people in India. A second trend was identically worded messages. First, a 
dozen or so people linked to www.facebook.com/funHETU, which is a hu-
mor page for Indians, using the same wording “Outsourced [HQ]” after the 
link. Second, a handful featured a word-for-word blurb linking to www.nbc.
com: “Talk to the Outsourced virtual call center. Operators are standing by. 
Outsourced, premiering September 23rd at 9:30/8:30c only on NBC.” Each 
posting came from a different person but likely generated by a “tell your 
friends” Facebook link on an NBC website. A final but smaller theme was 
posting a particular punch line from the show, worded slightly differently. 
The “moustache ride” joke apparently resonated with many viewers who 
chose to make it their Facebook post, minus an accompanying link or video 
clip (just the show title).
Dancing With the Stars (DWTS). DWTS was not a new show in Octo-
ber 2010, but was included to contrast with scripted programs. This reality 
competition draws huge audiences each week and breaks the template for 
themes in this study. First, an extraordinary number of Twitter links are

cross-posted to Facebook for Dancing with the Stars. Second, comments 
are driven by the competition itself, with posters rooting for and against the 
season’s contestants. Very little was posted about frontrunner contestant Jen-
nifer Grey and nothing at all about Brandy or other finalists (except Bristol 
Palin, daughter of the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah 
Palin, who frequently appeared in the audience.) Palin drew many comments 
but so, too, did Michael Bolton, Margaret Cho, and Michael “The Situation” 
Sorrentino (including one post from himself). Michael Bolton was the butt of 
a re-tweeted Twitter (and Facebook) line from Conan O’Brien: “The Chilean 
Miners could be released this weekend...just in time to see Michael Bolton 
sing on DWTS. Guys, what’s an extra day?” The dominant theme after the 
numerous contestant associations was the large number of video clips, includ-
ing some from previous seasons. Competitive dance is such a visual element 
that these clips were commonly shared. Thus, the enthusiasm so common to 
the other shows in this study was focused instead on those who competed. A 
secondary theme was a recurring question: “Who got voted off?” Surely those 
wondering could have Googled the answer, but they chose to ask their friends 
on Facebook. This choice reflects an effort to connect with other fans, much 
more than it serves to answer their question. One young girl wrote: “I’m so 
mad! Accidentally deleted the results of DWTS off the DVR :( Somebody tell 
me who got eliminated Tuesday night?” All of these questions, in fact, were 
posed by women, even though the gender split of those who posted a Dancing 
with the Stars comment seemed fairly even.
Hellcats. This show from the CW network is full of youth appeal, mostly 
comments originating on Facebook but some cross-posted from Twitter. The 
most striking finding is that more people claiming to be “watching” than en-
joying, although no one seems to dislike the show. Those people who claim to 
be addicted to Hellcats, judging from their Facebook photos, are quite young 
(not too surprising given the cheerleader theme. One poster described the 
show as Bring It On meets Mean Girls. Overall, the enthusiasm is reflected in 
the number of smiley-faces and sideways hearts <3 and text-style words like 
“ur” and “u” instead of “your” and “you.” A simple example from a teen-aged 
Latina was “I’ve become addicted to Hellcats :) lol.” This show elicited a sub-
stantial number of links to video clips, many of which have the same preview 
wording, which suggests they come from the same YouTube or cwtv.com 
link to Facebook. Beyond the youthfulness of the fan base, however, the wall 
postings for Hellcats were similar to other shows in this study.
Glee. One of Fox network’s biggest hits, this show already attracted some 
research attention for its reliance on Internet viewers (Perren, 2010). Glee 
elicited a large number of positive comments. Text comments were the ex-
pected prominence, but comments tied to video links were extremely high.

49
Subcategories of videos included links to a recent skit on NBC’s Saturday 
Night Live, mentions of Charice (a popular character on Glee), and specific 
video “covers” of popular songs. The number of people updating their Face-
book status as “watching” the show was less than the norm for programs in 
this study. Very few people had anything neutral or negative to say about the 
show. One unanticipated theme was listening to songs from Glee on the radio 
or portable audio players. This reflects the show’s focus on music. A few 
Facebook users commented on the program becoming “more popular than the 
Beatles” with more hits in the Top 100 songs list (Kreps, 2010), complaining 
that the hit songs were not original versions as had been the case with songs 
from the Beatles. Still, the popularity of a television show crossed over to 
other media. Random miscellaneous comments included a bar (Oxwood Inn) 
touting its Glee drink specials, a student working on her dissertation while 
listening to Glee songs in a cold library, and a young black man who com-
mented “Im a big ass softie underneath it all. Glee finally broke me down. 
Cryd like a baby lol” [his spelling]. Another recurring theme was a campaign 
to follow “Winston van der Woodsen” on Facebook to obtain additional vid-
eos. These messages were identical but not Twitter re-tweets. It is likely that 
visitors to Winton’s videos were offered a link to share a canned message 
with friends. The opportunity of Glee fanatics (called gleeks) to connect with 
others seems unlimited.
CONCLUSION
This study revealed some similarities and differences among the various 
programs. As mentioned above, nearly all users, regardless of the actual 
program, self-identified as fans of the television show (rarely making ran-
dom derogatory remarks). In all cases, there were those who saw their own 
viewing as framed by a time period (e.g., prime time), an activity among 
other mundane interests, or a solitary obsession. Few people offered deeper 
criticism; apparently the form works against the content (Postman, 1985).
One can wonder what Neil Postman would have written about the cyber-
sphere, where no discussion is too trivial. As a media theorist and cultural 
critic, Postman is best remembered for his 1985 book about television, Amus-
ing Ourselves to Death. Probably he would view social media as a logical 
extension of mass media and its connection to popular culture: less discourse 
and more “amusing ourselves to death.” Postman died in 2003, however.
Surely, enjoyment itself was a recurring motif on these Facebook walls. 
It is striking how many people can communicate a range of interpretations 
simply by invoking the name of a show: “Glee!” or “DWTS!” Posting a word

is akin to wearing a sweatshirt with a team logo. The communicator is mak-
ing a statement. The excitement and enthusiasm for watching television was 
clearly the dominant theme. A relative lack of critical comments was surpris-
ing. One possible explanation is that these shows are regularly scheduled. A 
study of special events might elicit more negative comments.
Media observers have taken note of the audience’s willingness to make 
rude comments about live events, such as the Super Bowl and the Academy 
Awards (Stelter, 2011). The key difference among the comments posted for 
different shows was the use of video clips. Sharing an experience is inher-
ently unlike sharing a declared message or posing an engaging question. Fu-
ture research should explore the reasons why people want others to see or ex-
perience what they saw or experienced. Previous research on self-disclosure 
(e.g., Ledbetter et al., 2010) seems a productive theoretical thread to explore.
Another difference was the level of detail offered in messages. Established 
programs were more specific about a given episode or character appearance. 
Newer shows focused on the excitement of their being new. It would be in-
teresting to see if established shows also had one-word wall postings when 
they were new.
Meaning
People on Facebook are expected to be upbeat, though more than a few of 
them go for the negative or snarky comment. Saying something about what 
one is doing or thinking is inherently a positioning of self, communicating 
who one is or what one believes or how one views the world. Sometimes the 
message is manifest and occasionally it is latent. Over time, discussion of 
television shows may migrate to Facebook Fan pages, where viewers may 
experience more freedom to participate in discussions of television culture 
(Jenkins, 1992, 2006).
Judging from the collective comments in this study, people are positive or 
they choose to say nothing at all. One differentiating dimension is whether 
someone is stating or asking a viewpoint. Posing questions is an attempt to 
engage others, although merely making a statement will attract comments, 
supporting or not. Future studies should examine the stream of responding 
comments generated by each message. At the beginning of data collection, 
visiting the page of a particular contributor was not feasible. Toward the end 
of the study, Openbook began focusing on walls that were public without the 
need of “friending” the originator.
If there is one overarching lesson from studying how people watch televi-
sion and share with others using social media, it would be that we live in

an era of “more choice, more voice” with regard to all media. Forty years 
ago we had limited choice and limited voice. Viewers could choose among 
three broadcast networks and engage in face-to-face interpersonal contact. 
The feedback loop for television was limited to letter-writing and the water 
cooler. Twenty years ago we had more choice, thanks to the growth of cable 
and satellite distribution of more channels, but still limited voice. Today we 
have both choice and voice, in abundance, and the impact of newer media 
on older media is potentially and increasingly significant. Even the bloggers 
and microbloggers themselves (e.g., Hamilton, 2011) are intrigued at the way 
Twitter is altering the way television is consumed.
Future research should include cable networks, not just broadcast net-
works. Now that the exploratory work has been done, qualitative research-
ers can use more in-depth data collection, engaging people in individual 
interviews and/or focus groups. Future research might examine whether the 
general tone of comments elsewhere on those same contributor’s walls had a 
similar negative viewpoint. Certainly, another welcome step is to gauge the 
uses and gratifications of social media messages as they pertain to traditional 
media content, perhaps using quantitative surveys. The qualitative approach 
has shown its potential to supply preliminary findings on this important topic.

Chapter Four
Social Media in Education: Effects of 
Personalization and Interactivity on 
Engagement and Collaboration
Ronald A. Yaros
Social network sites (SNSs) offer personalization of users’ public persona 
with interactive sharing of that information with personal networks. Digital 
publishing makes communication easier through social media that construct 
“digital identities” (Acquisti & Gross, 2006). The question is to what extent 
can these processes enhance formal learning environments and how?
Facebook, the world’s most popular social network, surpassed 500 million 
registered users in 2010 (Crunchbase, 2010). The network’s popularity with 
digital natives who grew up with social media is due, in part, to the network’s 
ability to personalize content (i.e., text and multimedia) with interactivity, as 
users share and discuss content with friends and family (Yaros, 2009a). Since 
the inception of social networks, there has been a swell of discussion and 
experimentation in education about how social media can be used effectively 
for course content. However, systematic research focusing on social media’s 
broader psychological and potentially motivational benefits has been limited. 
Some educators continue to wrestle with ways to either limit or exploit social 
media in their classroom to either protect or enhance traditional teaching and 
learning methods.
The case study described in this chapter explored whether social media, such 
as Twitter and Facebook, can facilitate learning by enhancing students’ engage-
ment, identity and enjoyment of a given course, independent of the content to 
be learned. The implication is that increasing student interest and engagement 
through social media will also facilitate knowledge transfer (Yaros, 2009b). 
This seems to be a realistic goal because it has been known for some time that 
human behavior is influenced not solely by psychological factors, but also by 
environments and social contexts that impact positive and negative behaviors 
and decisions (Rotter, 1954). That early work led to the emergence of social

Ronald A. Yaros
learning theory, which views psychological functioning as a continuous recip-
rocal interaction of personal and environmental determinants. In other words, 
people who interact with each other learn from each other, leading psycholo-
gists to view the determinants of behavior as residing not within the organism, 
but also in environmental forces (Bandura, 1977, 2008). If used appropriately, 
social media offers a unique environment for continuous observations and shar-
ing outside traditional face-to-face class meetings.
When applied to virtual communities, social learning theory centered on 
three aspects of knowledge (Henri & Pudelko, 2003). First, humans are es-
sentially social, so students gain from participating in a community. Some 
even argue that participation always leads to learning since it “contributes to 
the construction of identity” (Henri & Pudelko, 2003, p. 475). Second, social-
ization and learning can occur concurrently, making learning a social process. 
Third, meaning depends on both participation and reification, so an important 
goal when learning is ascribing meaning to life experiences. In sum, these 
aspects build on the notion that participation in a community provides the 
basis for learning and identity construction.
Of course, it is not just about what is learned, but how it is learned (Lave & 
Wenger, 1991). These researchers define learning as an increase in participa-
tion rather than internalization of knowledge or Situated Learning Theory. This 
theory, which emerged with computer-mediated communication, suggested that 
educators move beyond traditional views of social media as only curriculum-
delivery devices, teaching aids or ‘‘neutral tools.” Instead, computer-mediated 
communication should engage students with critical and creative learning. Now 
that social media are an integral part of daily life for most students, new re-
search could reveal how social media might contribute to learning in new ways.
The haunting challenge for some educators, however, is that “nonaca-
demic” communicative illiteracies are perceived to differ from school-sanc-
tioned academic literacy (Greenhow & Robelia, 2009). This position moti-
vated some to suggest so-called “hybrid” courses that engage an increasingly 
social and participatory student population with the blending of face-to-face 
meetings with interactive social media between meetings. This model is al-
ready providing evidence of social media’s value in education. For example, 
when modeling educational usage of social media from 606 Facebook users, 
researchers concluded that 45% of educational usage of the social network 
could be explained by user purposes (Mazman & Usluel, 2009). Most of the 
research, however, focuses on the uses and not the long-term perceptions and 
effects of social media. To extend the social media literature, four theoreti-
cally motivated concepts pursued in this chapter include: 1) personalization 
and 2) interactivity that enhance students’ 3) perceived class cohesion, and 4) 
enjoyment through engagement (figure 4.1).

Personalization and Interactivity
For the purposes of this discussion, personalization is the degree to which 
content is tailored to individual students. Students who customize their 
preferences for content become their own “gatekeepers” of information 
(Shoemaker, 1991). This applies to social media in education because it 
has been shown that freedom to control one’s choices in nonlinear envi-
ronments can enhance comprehension (Yaros, 2010a; Young, 1996). We 
also know that users embrace personalized web sites when confronted with 
overwhelming amounts of information online (Eppler & Mengis, 2004). 
Web portals that personalize content generate more positive user attitudes 
(Kalyanaraman & Sundar, 2006). These attitudes are attributed to: 1) a 
user’s ability to customize; 2) a user’s perceived relevance of the content; 
and 3) novelty of the content.
When learning content, a topic-specific discussion in which users share 
common interests and reactions is a form of personalization because the 
interaction contributes to a “self-as source” perception (Yaros, 2010b). This 
is particularly relevant if the participation and personalization are associated 
with a student’s self-identity. “Affectively true self-as-source can foster posi-
tive attitudes toward content by invoking a greater sense of ‘me-ness’ in that 
users may see their content gate-keeping decisions as reflecting their identity” 
(Sundar & Marathe, 2006, p. 5).
Personalization through social media such as Facebook also requires 
interactivity (i.e., engagement) with technology. Although the relationship 
between interactivity and engagement may seem intuitive, interactivity can 
be difficult to conceptualize (McMillan, 2002; McMillan & Downes, 2000). 
This may explain the differing definitions of interactivity from study to study 
and why some measure only users’ perceived interactivity (Cho & Leckenby, 
1999; Wu, 1999). Some believe interactivity tends to force user attention on 
content and increases user engagement (Sundar, 2007). Others demonstrated

how interactive users experienced increased levels of cognitive elaboration 
and recall of content (Tremayne & Dunwoody, 2001). In this chapter, social 
interactivity is measured as the degree to which students are offered choices 
and opportunities with social media to exchange information with each other. 
In this case, it differs slightly from participation when the term describes the 
activity of one individual (i.e., answering a question in class). Interactivity 
with social media describes communication between two or more individuals 
and is differentiated from the time spent in a social medium’s communication 
environments (i.e., Twitter). This concept is engagement.
ENGAGEMENT
Fundamentally, interest in a particular topic influences one’s selective 
exposure to content (Ettema, Brown, & Luepker, 1983; Genova & Green-
berg, 1979; Kwak, 1999; Viswanath, Kahn, Finnegan, Hertog, & Potter, 
1993). Engagement with (or attention to) content is referred to as sustained 
interest in social media content, such as information on Facebook or Twit-
ter, regardless if the individual shares information with others. Generally 
speaking, interest can be a “slippery construct” to conceptualize (Kintsch, 
1992) because early cognition studies determined comprehension depends 
not only on one’s engagement but also on one’s prior knowledge of the 
world (Berstein, 1955). At the same time, measurements of free recall and 
interviews following exposure to content suggested that individuals self-
reporting more interest in a topic exhibited deeper processing of that con-
tent (Fransson, 1977; Yaros, 2008).
Although a meta-analysis of studies spanning 25 years found a persistent 
but small correlation (approximately r = .30) between one’s interest in content 
and his or her academic achievement (Schiefele, 1992), interest in content is 
often influenced by the environment in which content is presented. This was 
demonstrated by a study that combined eye-tracking with measures of under-
standing and found that comprehension of health information depended more 
on how content is presented rather than the time spent viewing it (Yaros & 
Cook, 2009, 2010). This evidence underscores the need to precisely explicate 
the concept of interest or engagement with content.
Specifically, engagement is conceptualized as situational interest (Ander-
son, Shirey, Wilson, & Fielding, 1987; Hidi & McLaren, 1990) in a particular 
environment (Hidi, 1990; Hidi & Baird, 1986; Renninger, Hidi, & Krapp, 
1992), such as a social network. In other words, situational interest is the 
product of characteristics within a specific environment (i.e., Facebook) at 
a given time (Hidi & McLaren, 1990; Yaros, 2006). Previous research has

61
shown how situational interest can be suddenly evoked by viewing a novel 
graphic or a dynamic lecturer, which can be independent of a student’s prior 
knowledge of or interactivity with content (Hidi & Baird, 1986; Hidi & 
McLaren, 1990). Based on this more precise conceptualization:
RQ1: To what extent do social media enhance students’ engagement with 
course content?
To the benefit of educational objectives, students’ use of social media 
to produce and share content evokes interest through simultaneous per-
sonalization and interactivity. This is not to say that personalization and 
interactivity are processes exclusive to social media. Instead, the question is 
how students’ interest, interactivity and engagement with a course through 
social media influence the students’ perceived cohesion and enjoyment of 
a class? Specifically:
RQ2: Can social media within a formal learning environment enhance stu-
dents’ perceived cohesion of a course?
COURSE COHESION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA
Ashforth and Mael (1989) found that when individuals identify with a group, 
“the values and practices of the in-group become more salient and perceived 
as unique and distinctive” (p. 26). Fiol and O’Connor (2005) traced the 
mechanisms and moderators of cohesion by the identification that develops 
in virtual or “hybrid” course settings and contrasted those environments with 
face-to-face meetings. Their results, combined with those from other studies, 
suggest that social media can contribute to individuals’ satisfaction with life 
(Kahneman, Krueger, & Alan, 2006). Individuals who interacted regularly 
with Facebook, for example, were more likely to feel connected and happier 
(Valkenburg, Peter, & Schouten, 2006). In a separate study, the use of social 
media in a high school class led to “meaningful learning” through develop-
ment of social identities that shaped what students knew, felt and did, and 
how they made sense of their experiences (Greenhow & Robelia, 2009). 
Learning is not memorization. It relates to the processes of transforming 
into a different person in relation to the systems of relations. Ignoring the 
relational aspect overlooks how learning involves the construction of identi-
ties (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Observable relationships between learning and 
social identity emerge because “identity, knowing, and social membership 
entail one another” (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 53).

Ronald A. Yaros
Accordingly, a student’s perceived self-importance and “cohesion” of a 
class that uses social media is explained, in part, by Social Identity Theory. 
Developed by Tajfel and Turner (1985), the theory initially explained the 
psychology behind the discrimination between two arbitrarily defined groups 
(Jones, 2002). Over time an assertion central to the theory was that part of an 
individual’s self-concept comes from knowing s/he is a member of a group or 
groups. This is “coupled with the value and emotional significance attached 
to that group membership” (Tajfel, 1981, p. 255). Based on this theory, so-
cial media in education offers unique on-demand collaborative benefits not 
always found with traditional tools in education (Yaros, 2010b).
Although Social Identity Theory has undergone several revisions, a 
prevailing dimension is the importance of one’s identification in a group 
or—in the context of this chapter—a class. Arguably, class identity could 
evolve from a student’s unique attributes through membership in a course’s 
Facebook group (Yaros, 2010a). Combine this with social media’s ability to 
personalize information in an interactive environment, and the stage is set for 
students to engage with classmates and course content.
Examples of the effects of social media in education continue to emerge. 
For example, a survey of more than 2,500 college students found positive 
relationships between Facebook use and students’ lives, satisfaction, social 
trust and civic engagement (Valenzuela, Park, & Kee, 2009). This leads one 
to posit that the use of social media to seek, select and share course content 
could enhance students’ perceptions of class cohesion and ultimately, enjoy-
ment of the class. The question is:
RQ3: Can class cohesion through social media enhance students’ enjoyment 
of a course, compared to other courses?
To test this and the two previous questions, data were collected using an 
identical survey at five different times spanning three social media projects 
during two semesters.
SOCIAL MEDIA PROJECT ONE: FACEBOOK
Eight weeks into the spring semester the first of two social media projects 
was conducted in the same semester. A within-subjects nonequivalent depen-
dent variables (NEDV) experiment was conducted with a course Facebook 
group during a week when no classes were held (spring break). The NEDV 
design is based on data collected from one group (a class). Although the 
design can be weak, it is made considerably stronger by adding multiple out-

comes variables then verifying the variables change consistently for a given 
treatment. Several outcome variables are then associated with a theory that 
helps to indicate how affected (from most to least) each variable will be by 
the treatment(s) (Trochim & Donnelly, 2007). To add validity, the strength 
and direction of the dependent variables are tested and retested utilizing the 
same stimulus (social media) and instrument (survey). Admittedly, this de-
sign contributed more to a case study of social media in a course than it did 
to a generalizable experiment.
Participants
Participants for the first two projects were the same undergraduates (n = 36) 
in an introductory information literacy course. The course is open to freshmen 
through seniors from any major at a large mid-Atlantic university. Mean age 
of the sample was 21 years (SD = 1.62).
Instrument
A social media survey of 17 items was administered three times during the 
same spring semester, the first two immediately before and again after this 
Facebook project and the third survey after the second project. The survey 
included ten Likert scale questions, five yes/no and two demographic ques-
tions. Items to measure perceived cohesion included: “On a scale from 1 to 
5 (with 1 representing not at all knowing and 5 representing knowing very 
well), I know my classmates in this class.” The same scale was used for the 
statement, “I like my classmates in this class.” Responses to these questions 
were contrasted with how well students thought they knew and liked class-
mates in other courses. To measure enjoyment of the course, students also 
used the scale to indicate the extent to which they “enjoy this class” followed 
by how much they enjoyed their other classes. Other survey items solicited 
students’ comfort levels with sharing information on Facebook, perceptions 
of how much their opinions are respected by others and their comfort level to 
complete a class project with one partner or in a small group.
To quantitatively measure the class’s engagement with social media, a 
content analysis of all Facebook group posts was also conducted. Coding 
counted the number of posts and the name of the participant (to award extra 
credit). Five media categories were coded to indicate if a post was: 1) an 
original text, 2) a text comment to a previous post, 3) photo, 4) video or 
5) shared link. Nine categories of content were used to differentiate whether 
posts were about: 1) friends, 2) family members and/or pets, 3) observed 
scenery, including weather, 4) a personal activity, 5) personal insight/opinion

about a topic, 6) something newly purchased, 7) reference to an external link, 
8) comment about another post or 9) school work.
Procedure
Prior to a nine-day spring break (Saturday through Sunday), all students in 
class were asked if they wished to complete the first online survey in ex-
change for 5 extra points (in a class of 500 points). All students volunteered 
to complete the survey, which took about 15 minutes. Participants were in-
formed that completing the survey was independent of any volunteer partici-
pation in an upcoming spring break project. Participants could earn up to 25 
additional extra credit points. To participate during spring break, volunteers 
completed an online consent form and were asked to send their request to join 
the Facebook group, which would be available the next day (the Friday before 
spring break). Of the 36 students in the class, 29 volunteered to participate for 
spring break. Nineteen of the 29 participants were female. The “spring break” 
Facebook group was available only to student members, not the public. Only 
the teaching assistant (not the professor) joined the group.
Participants were asked to share any type of spring break information they 
were comfortable sharing with classmates. Of the 25 possible points, 15 
would be granted for at least three Facebook text postings during each day 
of the nine-day break. An additional five points could be earned for at least 
one original photo uploaded and 5 points for at least one video. Students were 
told that no additional credit would be granted for more than the minimum 
required text, photo and video postings. There was, however, no maximum 
limit to the number of posts. No other announcements or communication 
from the professor followed during spring break.
Following spring break, all students were asked to again complete the 
survey administered before break. Since a second social media project would 
follow three weeks after this one, results of the first project were not yet 
shared with the class.
SOCIAL MEDIA PROJECT 2: TWITTER
Two weeks after the first project, students in the same class were offered 
extra credit in exchange for participation in a mobile social media project. 
A campus “mobility initiative” supplied all students in the course with an 
Apple iPod Touch and Wi-Fi access for three weeks. Students received one 
hour of training on the device and were asked to begin using the device to 
gather and contribute content to the course’s blog and Twitter feed. After 
two weeks of using the devices, students were offered the second extra credit

opportunity. It required use of the iPod Touch to “report” events during an 
upcoming campus-wide Saturday “open house.” This annual event—open to 
the public—featured presentations by virtually every department on campus. 
To earn 20 extra points, participants were required to spend at least three 
hours on campus collecting and sharing audio interviews and tweets from 
different campus locations. Finally, at the first class meeting following this 
second event, all students completed the third survey.
RESULTS FROM PROJECTS 1 AND 2
These results are from the content analysis of project one’s Facebook post-
ings plus the three surveys related to the two projects described (spring break 
Facebook and mobile Twitter).
Content Analysis Data. For context, if all 29 students earned credit for 
the minimum number of three Facebook text postings and one photo dur-
ing spring break, the number of postings would have totaled 87 with 29 
photos. (Recall that no additional credit was granted for postings beyond 
the required minimum.) The actual number of text postings recorded totaled 
361 (or approximately 12 posts per student) with 40 photos. Only one of the 
29 students did not meet the minimum three postings and the most postings 
by one student totaled 30. Clearly, student engagement—as indicated by 
the number of text postings—far exceeded the minimum requirements for 
15 points. Only the optional videos fell short of the minimum with three 
videos uploaded.
Another indicator of engagement was that 28 of the 29 students contrib-
uted postings on all nine days of spring break. (One student dropped early 
for health reasons.) The number of daily postings (figure 4.2) indicates that 
activity was consistent during break with a gradual increase in postings the 
last three days of the period.

For content, two coders independently analyzed the first 10% of the 
postings (n = 35) of the Facebook posts. For intercoder reliability, a high 
Chronbach’s alpha of .935 was measured. Not surprisingly, text made up the 
majority of the Facebook media (66%) with a total of 239 posts. Comments 
about postings of other participants ranked second (16%) with 57 postings. 
A total of 40 photos represented 11% of the media, followed by shared links 
(n = 22) or 6% of the total. The three original videos represented less than 
1% of the postings.
By category, postings of “activities” (swimming, shopping, etc.) were 
most prominent with 140, followed by “insights and opinions” (62 postings), 
“family-related” (25 postings), and “scenery comments” (20 postings). Inter-
estingly, the number of postings about friends and school assignments each 
tied at a relatively low number of 18 postings each. Three posts were coded 
as something newly purchased or miscellaneous, which did not fit within the 
main categories.
Survey Data. The two research questions asked whether social media could 
contribute to students’ perceived class cohesion and enjoyment of a course. 
Repeated-measures analyses were conducted for the three surveys. Based on 
variability due to participants, a family wise alpha level of .05 was used to 
reduce the risk of Type 1 error. 
Factor analysis. Examining the Facebook survey items for factorability, the 
Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin measure of sampling adequacy neared the recommended 
value of .60 (.51). Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (χ² (91) = 196.25, 
p < .001). The diagonals of the anti-image correlation matrix were all above 
.3, with 10 of 12 items above .5. This supported the inclusion of each item in 
the factor analysis. Finally, communalities above .5 further confirmed that each 
item shared some common variance with other items (Table 4.1).
A factor analysis was conducted for all 12 items. Initial Eigen values sug-
gested that the first factor explained 28% of the variance; the second factor 
16% and a third factor 13% of the variance. The fourth and fifth factors ex-
plained less than 10% of the variance. Therefore, the two factors of collabo-

ration and course enjoyment emerged from the factor analysis. A principal 
components factor analysis of the 11 items using varimax rotation revealed 
two factors that explained 44% of the variance. All of the 11 items had pri-
mary loadings over .4. For reliability, a Cronbach’s alpha of .78 was also 
measured for the four items of: 1) likes other classmates, 2) interest in class 
friendships, 3) interest in a group project, and 4) interest in a partner project. 
This suggested the items were sufficiently interrelated for combination into 
the two indices of class collaboration and enjoyment.
Repeated Measures. As indicated in table 4.2, the means for 10 of the 12 
measures increased from the pre-Facebook survey to the third survey near the 
end of the semester. At the same time, two of the measures decreased. These 
decreases were for liking other classes (compared to this class) and liking 
classmates in other courses.
Of the ten measures that increased, four of the changes were statistically 
significant. These items included the extent to which students knew the class-
mates after the nine day spring break, F (2,33) = 5.32, p <. 05, and liked fellow 
classmates, F (2,33) = 3.46, p <. 05), interest in group collaboration, F (2, 33) 
= 6.23, p < .05) and a partner collaboration, F (2,33) = 4.20, p < .05.
Collapsing all items into the two indices described in the factor analysis 
indicates that enjoyment of the class (pre-Facebook = 3.1, post-Facebook = 
3.1, end of class = 3.4, and pre-posttest difference = 4.87 with p < .05) and 
measures for collaboration (pre-Facebook = 3.9, post-Facebook = 3.9, end of 
class = 4.1, and pre-posttest difference = 2.71) both increased. The increase 
in class enjoyment was statistically significant.

SOCIAL MEDIA PROJECT 3: COMPARING SEMESTERS
Three “YES/NO” survey questions asked students whether they agreed or 
disagreed with statements about courses that use social media. The goal 
was to measure whether the students: 1) felt comfortable sharing informa-
tion on a class social network, 2) whether courses that use social media 
are considered innovative, 3) and whether students felt their opinions are 
respected by the class.
Since the same information literacy course was offered for a second semes-
ter in the fall of 2010, the survey previously used in spring was administered 
before and after Thanksgiving break. Similar to the spring break Facebook 
project, this second sample of students (also n = 36) received iPod Touches 
and, for extra credit, shared information on the Facebook group during the 
brief Thanksgiving break. The pre- and post-surveys were administered six 
days apart (including the Thanksgiving weekend). Table 4.3 lists the percent-
ages of those students agreeing with each of the three survey questions.
Across the five surveys and two semesters, students’ agreement that 
courses with social media are innovative increased from 82% to 86% in the 
spring, and from 94% to 97% in the fall course. The students’ level of com-
fort with sharing information on a class Facebook site also increased from 
79% to 83% in spring, and from 81% to 100% in the fall. Finally, agreement 
that opinions were respected by peers increased in spring from 82% to 100% 
and remained unchanged during the Thanksgiving break at 100%. Again, a 
reminder that the time between the pre- and post-surveys in both spring and 
Thanksgiving breaks was only one week, when classes were not held.
CONCLUSION
This chapter of social media in education is based on the fundamental prem-
ise that learning begins when a student gains (and retains) interest in content 
to be learned. Nearly a hundred years ago, Dewey (1913) believed that inter-
est in learning was not a “flavoring” that could be sprinkled on an otherwise

boring subject. He characterized one’s interest in content as an active or “pro-
pulsive” state based on real objects and with high personal meaning. Little 
did Dewey know at the time that he was accurately describing the effects of 
today’s social media. Few, if any other, communication tools appear to simul-
taneously offer individuals both personal and interpersonal interactivity more 
than social media. That is because social networks inherently require user en-
gagement and interactivity if maximum personal meaning is to be achieved.
To be clear, presentation of the data in this chapter does not imply that 
personalization and interactivity do not already exist in education. Alterna-
tively, these data suggest that social media can significantly influence how 
students perceive and approach their educational environment, and the speed 
with which those social media influences can occur. Such outcomes help to 
underscore the need for continued experimentation and the pursuit of new 
theory that increases our understanding of how digital natives respond to the 
use of social media in education.
Of course, the role of course content cannot be ignored. This discussion 
provided little specificity about the lessons, learning goals and outcomes of 
the information literacy course. However, the focus on how social media can 
serve as a conduit to learning—independent of content—keeps the responsi-
bility for specific lesson plans and learning outcomes where it belongs, with 
the instructor.
Social media are already being introduced in education with various types 
of content and activities. Some educators use social media merely to promote 
sharing among students. Other than anecdotal observations of student ap-
proval and interactivity, little research to date has systematically quantified 
other benefits related to social media use in education.
Ultimately, the extra course credit granted for the content generated in the 
two projects described depended on the amount of engagement. Students 
voluntarily contributed more than four times the minimum amount of post-
ings required. This alone makes a compelling argument that social media 
can motivate students to engage, share and learn. Most educators know all 
too well that such continuous participation is often difficult to achieve when 
students are expected to complete assignments during spring break, a week 
when homework is typically the last thing on a student’s mind.
At the same time, we know that learning is not just engagement with content. 
We also learn by collaborating in groups and observing the activities of others 
(Rogers, 1995). Independent of course content, it has been shown that social 
media contributes to a student’s social identity more so than completing work 
individually at home. Ashforth and Mael (1989) wrote that an “individual’s 
social identity may be derived not only from an organization, but also from 
his or her work group, department, union, lunch group, age cohort, fast-track

group, etc” (p. 22). In this study, observed increases in course enjoyment, and 
the interest in future collaboration with groups and partners appeared to be 
influenced by the students’ social identity, respect for his or her opinion, and 
enjoyment of the course and classmates.
Interestingly, it was rather surprising to see the students’ liking of other 
courses and their classmates consistently decreasing during such a short 
period of time. This was not the result of the increase in liking the social 
media class, but an observable negative correlation of enjoyment. It is dif-
ficult to explain this decrease during only one week when no classes were 
held. Several limitations of this case study need to be acknowledged. One is 
that the activity and measurements employed should be extended over more 
semesters with different students before results can be generalized. Although 
the course included a diverse student population of varying grade levels from 
more than 20 majors, it would be helpful to track results longitudinally. In 
the first Facebook project, extra course credit obviously helped to motivate 
students to post at least three times during spring break. But one could still 
question the perceived value of a student earning only up to 25 points during 
spring break for a class with a total of 500 points. Finally, while it is possible 
that the use of Facebook during spring break was novel enough to motivate 
student participation, it is still impressive that all but one of the 29 students 
posted each day and, in fact, posted more content as time passed. Again, lon-
gitudinal measures will help to shed more light on these trends.
The Future of Social Media in Education. We may never know or fully 
understand the myriad of variables that contribute to learners’ engagement 
and comprehension of content with social media. Given the popularity and 
ubiquity of social media, however, this appears to be an opportune time to 
posit and empirically measure effects and new theory related to social media 
in education. Concepts explicated in this chapter acknowledge previous uses 
and gratifications research (Blumler, 1979) that demonstrated how motiva-
tion alone can significantly enhance attention to content in traditional media. 
The combination of personalization, interactivity and engagement—even for 
an inchoate educational model—represents a start to the understanding of 
how social media might be used for more than just socializing.
Like any other teaching tool, social media should not and cannot be consid-
ered a “silver bullet” to address the challenges for effective teaching and learn-
ing in the future. Content still needs to be adapted and the teaching methods em-
ployed to assist with future development, application, and assessment of social 
media. For some teachers, such goals remain elusive and often complicated. It 
is common for educators to report that students appear to be more familiar with 
social media than the instructor. Perhaps the best response to this is for educa-
tors to explore and use social networks wherever and whenever possible. Based 
on the author’s experience, designing lessons to use with social media is not as

simple as selecting and ordering a textbook with predefined content, quizzes, 
and assignments. Integrating social media in education requires multiple and 
specific assignments for collecting information, data or references. New strate-
gies for collaborative learning, plus new rubrics to assess that learning, need to 
be devised if social media are to gain respect as a demonstrable tool beyond the 
one famous for personal communication and entertainment.
Looking to the future, techniques appropriate to each course and course 
content to be learned will depend on the needs and expertise of every in-
structor. This chapter merely demonstrated how social media can strengthen 
other behaviors and perceptions peripheral to the content to be learned, fac-
tors rarely addressed by domain-specific assignments, course readings, and 
syllabi. Newer digital tools for communication and learning are unparalleled 
in both quality and access. Digital media will continue to have a substantial 
impact on information seeking and acquisition. “The nature and direction of 
this impact are not clear” (Miller, 2004, p. 291). Social media—and the plat-
forms to deliver it—will only continue to grow in number and sophistication 
for the digital natives who grew up with digital technology (Yaros, 2009a).
In the interim, there continues to be much discussion and even debate about 
the pros and cons of using social media, such as Facebook, in education. Some 
say technology and social media can be distractions and potentially harmful to 
attention and learning. Others believe that revolutionizing social media tools, 
which are designed specifically for education, are on the horizon. It is reason-
able to assume that new features, mobile applets and even custom lesson plans 
for social media will be forthcoming, implying that social media can be used 
to effectively transfer different content to all students. Until those benefits can 
be substantiated, however, the best any educator can do is to at least consider 
and test whether integrating social media into their courses makes a difference.
Some educators believe that the directions of social media and education 
may be tangential. Others interpret the participatory data, attitudinal out-
comes and productivity reported in this chapter as evidence that social media 
and education can be synthesized and may even eventually converge. The 
projects reviewed here provide only preliminary results and more research is 
needed to determine whether social media are uniquely engaging and influ-
ential across all disciplines and grade levels. The initial indications—at least 
from the students in this course—are that such questions are worth pursuing.

Chapter Five
You Can’t Go Back Now: 
Incorporating “Disruptive” 
Technologies in the 
Large Lecture Hall
C. Michael Elavsky
Teaching a large general education lecture course is always a challenge, in 
that the students come to such forums with diverse backgrounds, perspec-
tives, and knowledge sets which often complicate their ability to engage with 
the subject matter at hand in collectively meaningful ways. Add to this the 
manner by which students often approach general education courses (as sites 
where, if they even attend, they are anonymous, silent vessels who ingest 
and spit back lecture notes on multiple-choice tests) and one is confronted 
with the realization that the education value of such courses can be extremely 
problematic. Likewise, in this age of ubiquitous portable media, such forums 
are rife with student disengagement, as they check text messages, Facebook, 
and other online sites which are often more immediately compelling to their 
sense of identity than the lecture at hand. But as some educators are discover-
ing, such “disruptive” technologies can actually open up broader possibilities 
for learning (Camplese & McDonald, 2010). While such technologies intro-
duce an inherent messiness to educational settings and their “logics,” their 
ubiquity among students and university life suggests a need to explore how 
they might be effectively incorporated into the contemporary classroom as 
a means for enhancing the communicative and collaborative potential of the 
large lecture setting.
What follows is a qualitative overview and assessment of two such en-
deavors, broadly considering how incorporating a variety of new technolo-
gies (i.e., Twitter, Google apps, Harvard Moderator, etc.) into a large lecture 
course impacted not only the daily dynamics of the class but also its peda-
gogical potential as a result of its inclusive design. To that end, this chapter 
sought to address—in a candid and straightforward manner—the parameters 
and logics behind embarking on such endeavors, as well as a frank assessment

of their outcomes. To the point, it seeks to more fully frame the implications 
for integrating these technologies—which crucially intersect conceptions of 
contemporary life and agency—into the design of the modern classroom. 
Presenting insights into the problems/possibilities of such undertakings gar-
nered from several semesters’ experience, the following seeks to illuminate 
some of the implications instructors face for understanding and engaging the 
evolving, immediate relationship that exists between the hopes and strategies 
of pedagogy and praxis, the increasing omnipresence and importance of so-
cial media in the personal lives and professional development of students in 
higher education settings, and the ways both are integrally related to nurtur-
ing not only the civic potential of our students, but the very essence of their 
educational development as well.
NEGOTIATING THE DEMANDS OF THE GENERAL CLUSTER
The large lecture course is a quintessential college experience for most 
individuals at bigger universities, marking their first years of higher educa-
tion for better and/or for worse. Yet while these courses ostensibly serve to 
introduce wider sets of ideas to a larger and broader range of students, the 
tacit question remains as to just what students take away from their “par-
ticipation” therein. Exposing students to perspectives from a wider range of 
disciplines is the estimable goal, yet the structure and parameters of such 
courses (especially in contemporary times) present formidable challenges 
to the very idea of education; challenges, however, that the instructors who 
teach such courses are forced—if they truly are invested in their calling—to 
wrestle with in crucial ways.
As liberal education electives, they are meant to augment the students’ 
scholarly thinking and professional development beyond the disciplinary 
boundaries and credit requirements of their major. In theory, they offer op-
portunities to approach learning in novel ways that empower the students, 
endowing them with a broader set of knowledge in preparation to deal with 
the complexity, diversity, and change they will encounter regularly in the 
wider world. In practice, they often include tenets which seek to promote the 
development of a sense of social responsibility and an array of active intel-
lectual and practical skills which can help them negotiate real-world settings 
in ways that extend beyond the “ideology” of their major (What is Liberal 
Education, 2010).
The professed goal of such courses is to produce “persons who are open-
minded and free from provincialism, dogma, preconception, and ideology,

aware of their place in the social and natural worlds” (Nussbaum, 2009, 
p. 7). Moreover, research suggests that student exposure to such liberal edu-
cation tenets encourages the development of a healthy skepticism of their 
cultural perspectives, independent thinking, and measureable proclivities 
toward civic engagement (i.e., greater participation in community service 
activities, internships, research assistantships, and study abroad programs 
as part of their academic development) (Project on Liberal Education and 
Sciences, 1990).
Pragmatically achieving such ends in larger general education courses, 
however, offers many challenges. First, such courses often register hundreds 
of students in large implicitly impersonal rooms. As “numbers” in such 
settings (i.e., the instructor will most likely never know them beyond their 
ID #s), it is understandable why the students embrace their anonymity within 
the dynamics such settings induce (i.e., glossophobia). Consequently, the em-
bedded tenor of the class is one of distanced pedagogy: the instructor lectur-
ing unidirectionally (occasionally soliciting input or responses from the front 
rows of the hall, and often repeating said feedback for it to be audible in the 
back rows), dispensing ideas fully invested/ensconced in the banking concept 
of learning (Freire, 1970) whereby the students act as receptacles for the in-
structor’s knowledge and authority, are assessed and rewarded according to 
their ability to reiterate it (often verbatim) on call, and potentially penalized 
for questioning or contributing in ways unsolicited. Admittedly, the modern 
classroom is rarely so draconian. Nonetheless, the elements which manifest 
such dynamics of rapport are often unconsciously stitched into the interstices 
of the large lecture course design by default.
Technology often stands in as a means to more effectively “connect” 
with the students, yet the contemporary use of microphones, PowerPoint 
slides, and e-learning platforms (i.e., Blackboard) can rarely compensate 
for the dearth of dynamic interpersonal communication in such classrooms. 
Moreover, these utilities have themselves become ubiquitous props, every 
bit as formulaic and alienating in the manner of their usage as perhaps the 
perceived drone of the lecturer’s voice. Add to this the increased corpora-
tization of our educational system whereby students are from an early age 
groomed with the impulse to develop grades, skill-sets and a résumé for 
real world job opportunities, implicitly trumping any broader inclination 
toward developing themselves and their thinking more holistically (in spite 
of university “missions” pledging the development of a student’s whole 
character) and one begins to understand why general education courses pos-
sess dubious “value” in student perceptions of their “education.” At large 
universities, such courses are perceived more as required for rather than 
related to their professional future.

Consequently, these issues impact how students choose their general edu-
cation courses, similarly influencing what they expect out of such courses and 
what they want from them in terms of an experience. To the point, the class 
often becomes a hurdle to be surmounted. First considerations for a majority 
in choosing which general education courses to take often centers on the time 
of the course (e.g., will I have to get up early for this class?) and whether at-
tendance is mandatory (e.g., do I actually have to go to class?), as the ability 
to opt out is premium in many an instructor’s experience. After these, the 
next concern is to focus on finding a subject that piques their interest while 
not demanding too much work such as reading, writing, and participation 
(i.e., active engagement). However, if the instructor/course is perceived as 
easy (see ratemyprofessor.com!) and there are also alternatives by which one 
can circumvent actually doing the work to get an A therein (e.g., did a friend 
take the class previously or are the class notes available through an auxiliary 
service-for-profit campus lecture note services?), then the concern about the 
subject matter becomes negotiable when balanced against easily boosting 
one’s GPA. And finally, there is the entertainment factor. In short, will this 
class keep the student awake? Or at the very least, will its design not encum-
ber their ability to exercise diversions?
And it is here that contemporary new media “disruptions” enter the picture 
(Camplese & McDonald, 2010). As university classrooms become increas-
ingly wired, so too student access to immediate Internet/auxiliary diversions 
(i.e., email, Facebook, poker/solitaire, texting, etc.). Ostensibly, such tech-
nologies offer a surfeit of opportunities for the students to be more dialed-in 
to the class, taking notes more readily, accessing related information in real-
time, and multi-managing course content more effectively; in reality, they 
often provide an outlet for student boredom should the instructor dally too 
long explicating on obscure concepts to the class; a trend that has become in-
creasingly common especially in such forums where the students are more or 
less hidden from direct view/confrontation. In smaller classrooms, instructors 
have the option of regulating such behavior either directly (course policies) 
or indirectly (by calling students out) but these options are severely limited in 
the large lecture hall unless one wishes to police more than teach. As such, the 
class often unfolds with a tacit agreement by which instructors and students 
go through their motions regarding engagement, student attention hopping 
between technology and lecture, instructors dispensing knowledge, and each 
side “engaged” with the classroom space, subject matter, and people therein 
as is “necessary.”
Consequently, this inherent arrangement serves to fuel the idea of the 
metaphorical general education foundry, its mechanisms stamping partici-
pants onward; students with “checked boxes” for the “knowledge” and credits

acquired/needed beyond their major, instructors “as providing a service to 
society,” and the broader university mission as diligently produced in spirit 
and program, if not always in fact.
THE DECISIONS EDUCATORS FACE
Many educators do not go lightly into this system of relations. But the param-
eters and determinations with which instructors must contend force serious 
considerations as to what changes are actually possible. The first pertains 
to the very structure of such courses. The idea of the lecture course stems 
from “tradition” and to shake that up is to ostensibly invite curiosity, if not 
censure from colleagues and students alike. Moreover, it is always easier for 
instructors to keep the status quo, as it decreases demands on one’s extracur-
ricular learning curve and overall workload, especially in terms of course 
management. In addition, the status quo serves to eliminate externalities in 
course design/implementation (prep time, lecture notes or test question errors, 
unexpected deviations in student “learning,” etc.). To the point, for many 
instructors, student participation beyond the script is often viewed inherently 
as problematic. But it begs real questions as to what knowledge students actu-
ally leave with from such educational experiences. However, confronting the 
problems of this design involves much more than simply reconfiguring the 
dominant structural paradigm. For example, stressing greater student inclu-
sion begs questions of how it might actually be truly achieved, as “student 
participation”—when simply stimulated through redesigned pedagogical 
controls—more often produces induced rather than organic results (e.g., stu-
dents must post so many responses to get an A, students receive extra credit 
for contributing to the dialogue in class, and so on).
Such concerns, in turn, speak to the design and implementation of assess-
ment criteria as a factor in stimulating or stifling the students’ emergent collec-
tive potential to produce a more-inclusive and engaging learning environment. 
The utilization of multiple-choice tests in such settings certainly makes sense 
in terms of logistics, but in terms of the accuracy of assessment or student en-
gagement/outcomes (i.e., what did the student put in and get out of the course), 
they possess serious deficiencies. Didactic policy alternatives such as manda-
tory attendance, in-class quizzes, extra credit, and so forth rarely inspire the 
holistic engagement instructors seek. And E-education platform resources (i.e., 
Blackboard), while ostensibly inviting greater interpersonal exchange, operate 
rather as technologies of surveillance (to assess induced participation), more 
often inspiring the “preferred” responses the instructor seeks rather than honest 
reflection and input, in light of their function as assessment tools.

Yet, the capabilities of new media technologies today can actually pro-
vide solutions for students and instructors alike in this scenario and in do-
ing so, serve to reinvigorate the liberal arts education potential of today’s 
classrooms. When left unincorporated, new technologies encourage student 
absence in presence; their bodies in the room, their attention drifting un-
acknowledged. However, reconsidering these “disruptive” tendencies and 
incorporating them into contemporary course designs allows their innovative 
capabilities to be rechanneled such that they can actually contribute to stimu-
lating more-organic collaborative engagement in profound ways. But such 
possibilities start with educators reflecting on the instrumental role they play 
in this education system.
How must the role of the contemporary educator be reconceptualized? 
How do instructors actually engage the educational terrain on which they op-
erate? In what ways do instructors tangibly contribute to producing a liberal 
(liberating) educational experience in their course design and praxis, one that 
nurtures critical thinking skills and seeks to develop the character and values 
of an individual more holistically in ways that will demonstrably factor into 
and function as part of the students’ professional development and future? 
Or, perhaps most important, how, by maintaining tradition and protocol, do 
instructors serve as agents sustaining the problems of the system rather than 
addressing them? These are fundamental questions educators must them-
selves consider before any change is truly possible.
THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TECHNOLOGY IN FOSTERING 
LIBERAL EDUCATION VALUES IN THE LARGE CLASSROOM
Instructors and educators are the agents for changing the patterns and out-
comes of this system. Radically reorganizing the logics of the large lecture 
class in dramatic ways opens up possibilities for the dynamics therein to 
change, subsequently reconfiguring not only student expectations within such 
forums, but also the potential to produce more meaningful outcomes as well. 
Embracing such endeavors does not come easy for instructor or student, but 
it is the only way that liberal educational goals can be attained. The subject 
matter of each large lecture class offers its own specific opportunities and 
challenges for such moves, but every class possesses the potential for radical 
pedagogies to be enacted if one is dedicated to the task. What follows is an 
explication of how one course—entitled Media and Democracy—was rede-
signed (from being a college-specific elective for up to 40 students offered 
intermittently to being a campus-wide, large-lecture, humanities, general

education elective offered every semester for 300 students) with profound 
results. Previously possessing a solid and challenging law/policy focus (al-
though not exclusively) in its design, the course content was reorganized to be 
more general and perhaps less intimidating, such that it offered an alternative 
introduction to the subject matter but also a different intellectual approach to 
stimulate its participants as well.
As stated on the syllabus, the course sought to explore the role of the 
mass media in fostering democracy and democratic practices, as well as 
civic awareness and engagement more broadly. Doing so meant considering 
the concept of democracy itself and the media’s theoretical and practical 
relationship to nurturing its principles, as well as the role of government 
and its relationship to the media in constructing political knowledge, con-
ceptions of representative democracy, and an informed populace. Critical 
to all of this was discerning how culture impacts the mass media, how the 
mass media both contribute to and are shaped by culture, and what civic 
responsibilities and obligations the students have within this framework. 
To the point, the course design directly implicated the students in these 
educational explorations.
In turn, the course design was intentionally developed to appeal to the stu-
dents, inclining their participation beyond any reservations they retained about 
the course content (regarding democratic theory) and the aforementioned 
general education criteria. Such a course, Media and Democracy, lent itself 
implicitly and more readily than others perhaps to explorations related to new 
media. But more than that, the course design set out to address perceived gen-
eral educational attention deficits in ways reflective of the very excitement 
the instructor perceived in the essence of democracy—namely exploring con-
troversial subjects, challenging dialogues, deliberations and negotiations, the 
sharing and interrogating of varying perspectives, inquiry into the challenges 
of cultural consensus, and most of all, a recognition of how each individual 
is implicated in contemporary political events. In turn, the goal was not to 
explain but rather reveal and arrive at, through a shared purpose of mutually 
engaged inquiry, a stronger understanding of the relationship between media 
and democracy. As such, the pedagogical project enacted forced fundamental 
and necessary changes in how the course, its outcomes, and the very concep-
tion of engagement were envisioned. Moreover, it stimulated an interrogation 
of the role of educators as agents in deconstructing the overarching dominant 
corporatized education paradigm within which the large university setting is 
often invested (Giroux, 1999; Giroux & Aronowitz, 2000).
The overall structure of the course was loosened, providing an exploratory 
and uncertainty about it from the outset. The instructor engaged the students

often and informally, moving about the class in an almost talk-show format 
and speaking frankly without professorial overtones in ways that sought to 
make the subject matter both relatable and interesting (including utilizing hu-
mor and the occasional obscenity to add dramatic effect). Although the course 
material and approach in some ways were specifically designed to appeal to 
students, it was done so as a means to match the goals of the course to the per-
spectives students brought to the classroom. Today, the corporate university 
largely positions students as consumers. In turn, the “products” offered must 
therefore be designed both to appeal, and most important, to restructure their 
desires by exceeding their expectations. Designing an “inviting” course need 
not be implicitly improper, if such endeavors grant avenues and opportuni-
ties to stimulate new ways of thinking/seeing/being in the world, producing 
profoundly instructional moments and perhaps even life-changing outcomes 
which truly impact one’s broader vision of education.
As such, Media and Democracy was designed to offer structure in its 
format but also an emergent and inclusive potential in its subject matter and 
design, providing circuits by which students could participate in various 
ways and ultimately take ownership of their learning in the class. In doing 
so, the course was intended to be both entertaining and compelling across the 
board, the style and content of the forum designed to be open, engaging and 
unpredictable. And as was discovered, incorporating new media technolo-
gies fundamentally channeled the challenges present in the large-lecture hall 
dynamics toward more interesting and productive avenues for emergent dia-
logue, candid participation, and more inclusive and meaningful engagement 
in relation to the course.
Moreover, incorporating these technologies actually called attention to 
their disruptive potential, vividly illuminating the unspoken dynamics they 
bring to said spaces, and this revelation was exploited as both novelty and op-
portunity for exploring further the larger democratic praxi within an advanced 
democracy. Consequently, the course itself was transformed into a series of 
meta-theoretical explorations and teachable moments for all participants (in-
structors and students alike). The students were introduced to the subject mat-
ter through a course design which included the utilization of their disruptive 
social media, beckoning their participation in constructing knowledge around 
their engagements in a manner which ultimately asked them to interrogate 
the essential conceptions of their education practices, their education system, 
and the concepts and values it propagates as they relate (or not) to dominant 
conceptions of our democracy and civic agency. In turn, the overarching 
pedagogical goal—to stimulate student awareness through radical critical 
pedagogy as a means to reassert the meaning and value of liberal educational 
tenets—was fundamentally achieved in surprising and powerful ways.

CHALLENGING THE PARAMETERS OF THE LARGE 
LECTURE UNIVERSITY COURSE: TWO CASE STUDIES
Case Study 1: Semester 1
When Media and Democracy was initially offered as a general education 
course, it maintained many of the traditional and problematic design com-
ponents outlined above. The redesign offered the following paradigmatic 
changes. The course met two times a week. The first day of each week offered 
a straightforward lecture, utilizing PowerPoint slides to review, develop, and 
expand upon the main points from the thematic readings for the week. This 
lecture was augmented and punctuated by questions and responses elicited 
not only from the instructor, but also from the students and teaching assistants 
(whom were integral participants in the course design and implementation). 
The goal of this first lecture was to firmly position the students with a clear 
understanding of the issues and perspectives under consideration for the week 
and their relevance to the course themes itself.
The second class of each week was positioned as an open discussion. On 
these days, Twitter was integrally incorporated. Each student had been asked 
to create a Twitter account and to familiarize themselves with how it worked. 
Subsequently, the Twitter feed for the class (aggregated through the use of a 
hashtag ID) was projected live on the overhead screen in front. Acting as mod-
erator, the instructor would open up the discussion with questions related to the 
themes for the week and current events, and in a Donahue-esque fashion, would 
move about the lecture hall generating oral responses from the participants in 
the room. The instructor was also careful not to comment on each speaker’s 
point, intentionally attempting to defuse the participation of “authority” in the 
discussion. All the while, the teaching assistants peppered the conversation 
orally with points that pushed the students thinking in provocative ways (as 
agent provocateurs), maintaining activity on their own Twitter accounts so as 
to simultaneously engage the individuals utilizing that backchannel.
The projected backchannel provided an alternative, yet complementary out-
let for the students to express their ideas related not only to the theme discussed 
in class, but also to delve deeper into related topics or points, expanding the 
discussion in novel ways unique to the interests of those online participants. 
Moreover, it was not uncommon for alternative discussions to develop therein, 
based upon the posts of those participating. Most important, it seemed to offer 
a real means for broader participation (raising points, questions, etc.) for those 
students who either were not called on, did not want to state a controversial 
or opposing viewpoint audibly, or were perhaps too shy to state their opin-
ions aloud (students often utilized anonymous Twitter IDs). When relevant 
and possible, points from the projected backchannel were rolled back into the

in-class discussion, and conversely, points from the in-class discussion were 
often continued in the Twitter forum after class finished.
On certain days, guest speakers (e.g., a local congressional representative, 
the editor from a local alternative newspaper, the campus representatives for 
political parties, Iraq war veterans, and so on) were invited to speak with 
the class about what they do, why, and how they perceive their own civic 
engagement in the mix of democracy’s relationship to the media. On these 
days, Harvard Moderator, a program that allowed students to post and vote 
on questions to be posited to the panel members (all of which was projected 
in-class once again) was utilized so that the students could democratically 
generate the trajectory of the discussion with the panelists. Twitter was also 
utilized during these sessions, often interchangeably projected in an alterna-
tive screen window.
As such, the course became a mix of pedagogical control and open-
sourced/inclusive engagement whereby the instructor presented the general 
theme and related points, but their further development was student-directed. 
The backchannel certainly enhanced the students’ interest and participatory 
capabilities (although not everyone had their laptop present, one can text to 
Twitter with a mobile phone, thus ostensibly eliminating issues related to the 
digital divide). But it was in the redesigned assessment process by which the 
students truly took ownership of the course.
The multiple-choice test format for the class was maintained, however 
with a twist—namely the students submitted questions for the exams across 
the semester individually (they were collected utilizing Google Forms). Forty 
questions were ultimately chosen from those submitted and if one had their 
question chosen, they stood to get both extra credit (for creating a good, chal-
lenging, and fair question), and get the answer to the question correct. As 
such, even the exam process became inclusive, whereby the students were 
able to mark the parameters of knowledge generated from the course (read-
ings, videos, panel speakers, etc.) which they felt were most important to take 
away (as well as interrogating the very politics of assessment themselves). 
Having collected the questions (which numbered in the hundreds), they were 
reformatted onto a spreadsheet (with answers removed) and given back to the 
students two days prior to the exam so as to provide orientation on what they 
were about to be tested on. The tests, with 40 questions chosen from that list, 
were then administered in class; the process in principle being a democratic 
exercise “for the people, by the people.”
Outcomes
The class as a whole developed an air of excitement and vitality from the 
start, marking its dynamics in important and unusual ways. Although there

85
was no attendance policy, most of the students regularly came to class, and 
the atmosphere was a mix of loose and playful combined with tense prob-
ing critique, honest discussion, and challenging perspectives. And while 
one might assume that such an open-ended frame might lead to anarchy, 
it was surprisingly integrated and focused. The in-class discussions were 
self-regulated by all participants, with the students often bringing wayward 
perspectives back into the context of the discussion, producing a coherent 
examination of the ideas at hand, despite having upward of 40 participants in 
the oral and online forums at once. Also, surprisingly, the Twitter feed only 
demonstrated wayward tendencies at the outset (students posting silly or off-
topic statements). After three weeks, the novelty apparently wore off, and it 
became a true forum for more sincere and focused participation. In fact, the 
forum was distinctly respectful (despite the affordances of anonymity) in 
that “flaming” (i.e., posting an aggressive or condescending comment) only 
happened twice, and said posters were called out and reprimanded by their 
classmates so effectively that both ultimately felt compelled to apologize in 
the Twitter stream for their tone and conduct therein.
Likewise, Harvard Moderator allowed the students to democratically direct 
the discussion with guest speakers in ways that the students also found to be 
empowering (as revealed in the course evaluations and survey data obtained). 
But perhaps the most intriguing development (especially for the students with 
regard to taking ownership of the course, as also revealed in the course evalu-
ations) was the process surrounding the course assessment. Overall, the stu-
dents liked the idea of making their own exams. However, when they initially 
received the questions (over 300) for the first exam, the idea that they would 
be able to easily “know” the exam prior to the actual test day initially dis-
sipated into frustration (marked vividly by online posts in the Twitter feed). 
That is until one enterprising student took it upon himself to create a Google 
doc with all of the questions posted upon it, inviting the class—through the 
class Twitter feed as well—to collaboratively work out all the answers in the 
48 hours prior to exam.
And so they did, in astounding ways. From the outset, “stupid questions” 
(simple, off-topic, vague) were collectively identified and marked as “ones 
the Professor would never choose” (largely on the mark). Several posted their 
“own” answers to the questions they contributed. Others posted the answers 
they found and the place (i.e., reading and page #) where they could be veri-
fied. Most compelling, however, was how they collaboratively worked out 
the answers to the remaining (and tougher) questions (roughly 50) through 
successive deliberative posts; a process watched and documented by the in-
structor in realtime (downloading the Google doc as progressive screenshots). 
The students ultimately “finished” the study guide with 12 hours to spare

86 
C. Michael Elavsky
(which was approximately 95% right). No acknowledgment of any awareness 
of this process was made by the instructor but an anonymous survey and a 
focus group interview were later employed to dig deeper into these develop-
ments related to the course.
Assessing Outcomes
The results from the data were revealing. For while it was believed that the 
course was indeed a much more inclusive and collaborative endeavor, the 
data suggested that in fact, it was not as much as had been initially perceived. 
The survey data related to in-class participation suggested that only 15% of 
the students had regularly participated (presenting at least one oral contribu-
tion per class) and only approximately 40% having done so at all across the 
semester. Similar results were found regarding Twitter (less than 30% of 
students posted at all). Likewise, regarding the collaboration surrounding the 
Google doc study guide, the findings were analogous, with less than 30% of 
the class contributing anything to working out the answers. However, almost 
90% of them said that they used it to study for the exams!
While these findings were initially disheartening, the written evaluations/
assessment of the course conversely suggested that despite the fact that all 
were not “participating” as it was defined in the survey questions (posting 
or presenting their original idea in the class forums available), a substantial 
amount were in fact much more “engaged” in terms of attention, interest, and 
outcomes as a result of the design of the course and the implementation of 
new technologies, teaching strategies, and course dynamics. Over 85% of the 
students reported that the class had been especially compelling and revelatory 
regarding how they saw the world, their place in it, and their understanding 
of the media and its roles in a democracy. Moreover, they assessed the course 
very strongly, commenting that the mix of subject matter (entertaining, yet 
compelling class content and its delivery), use of media (new technologies, 
movies, clips, etc.), and instructional approach (loose and inclusive) had in-
strumentally affected not only how they now understood the subject matter, 
but more important, how they now understood the purpose of their education 
as part of a system and how their thinking had significantly changed regard-
ing their approach to its processes. Of course, all students were not satisfied, 
three responses in particular cited the “miserable failure” that was the class 
experiment. Nonetheless, the majority rated their “engagement” as high (de-
fining it as “regularly paying attention in class and online to course-related 
developments, if not necessarily contributing”), adding that the use of new 
technologies had definitively enhanced the feeling of the course (in terms of 
intimacy), their interest and knowledge of its subject matter, and their sense 
www.ebook777.com

You Can’t Go Back Now 
87
of how said technologies could be personally utilized in the future to enhance 
their own civic engagement.
Nonetheless, the survey results also suggested that the course retained a 
major contingent of students who were intent on remaining passive (in terms 
of developing their own voices) despite the various opportunities offered by 
which their more active participation could be enhanced. The following se-
mester presented another opportunity to address this issue.
Case Study 2: Semester 2
In the following semester, the impetus for active-collaboration was more 
fully incorporated, as the three-test format was abandoned in lieu of Google 
Doc group projects. This class also met two times per week. The same class 
format was maintained from the previous semester (more formal structured 
lecture on one day/Twitter and in-class discussion on the second), however, 
fewer guest speakers were utilized and Harvard Moderator was not em-
ployed. In the third week of class, the students were divided up into groups 
of 10 (the class ultimately had 187 students in it) and the assessment process 
was explained in depth, including the delivery of an explicit example by the 
instructor. To the point, the students were asked to collaborate on the devel-
opment of a Google doc which would include several deliverables: the doc 
itself (namely, several things that had to be developed and present in a posted 
doc on the web), a 10-minute in-class presentation (that was videotaped and 
subsequently posted to the doc via YouTube). Two different groups presented 
their Google doc presentations each week in-class across weeks 4–13, and 
a set of quiz questions emanating from the contents of the aforementioned 
docs were subsequently administered to the class via ANGEL, a course 
management system (CMS) similar to Blackboard that enables faculty to 
enhance their courses through Web design without knowledge of HTML. 
The quizzes counted for 50% of the grade and since they were based on the 
student-created documents each week, it ostensibly meant that the students 
were being asked to regularly engage the content their classmates had created, 
reading the document in full as it reviewed, developed and expanded upon the 
readings, lectures, and course theme for the week (and in relation to the over-
arching thematic development of the course). The Google doc/presentations 
counted for 30% of their grade resulting from a mix of assessments generated 
from the group’s leader and a group facilitator who assisted the students in 
developing their docs (through face-to-face and virtual meetings on the doc).
The final 20% of their grade came in the form of a final exam. However, 
this exam was also designed to be a collaborative and inclusive experience.

88 
C. Michael Elavsky
Having created their shared Google doc and having received their prelimi-
nary assessment (with tips on how to improve it and in turn, their grade), 
each group was asked to re-edit their document, addressing its perceived 
deficiencies (including grammar, graphics, style, reshooting video content, 
etc.) in the last two weeks of class. Finally, they were asked to post a 250-
word essay summarizing what they felt were the most important ideas their 
classmates should take away from their document and its theme in relation 
to the overarching themes of the course. The essays were posted promi-
nently on each of the Google docs and the final exam consisted of ques-
tions based on each of these 20 essays. In total, for better or for worse, the 
students—through the design of the course—had to theoretically develop 
their own opinions in relation to the course content (i.e., their Google doc 
projects), as well as engage and know the opinions and perspectives of their 
peers (for the quizzes and exams).
Outcomes
From the outset, the dynamics of class were much different. To the point, 
Twitter never got off the ground, despite all efforts. The students simply had 
no interest in embracing its affordances (many of them surprisingly were not 
familiar with it and had difficulty figuring out what it was useful for) so it 
never achieved anything close to the vibrancy and input of the previous se-
mester; a development simply unanticipated. However, on the contrary, the 
in-class participation was generally more vibrant and inclusive, perhaps due 
to the warmth of the room (the classroom had a better ambience) and smaller 
class size (113 fewer people). The time of the class (6:30 p.m.) definitely 
affected attendance and the energy levels (as the students stated on evalu-
ations), however it also seemed to stimulate more reflection in the group’s 
thinking, largely curtailing impulsive comments.
Observing the dynamics of the group projects illuminated the difficulties 
of initiating truly collaborative assignments. As stated, each group designated 
a leader and subsequently worked with a facilitator and teaching assistant 
(through two mandatory face-to-face meetings and virtual collaboration on 
the group’s Google doc) to complete their projects. Not surprisingly, most 
groups waited until the week they had to present to actually begin their 
work (although not all). From observations (facilitated by the capabilities of 
Google docs, where one can track participation in real time), most had 2–3 
really dedicated individuals, 2–3 putting in minimum effort, and 1–2 who 
contributed little, late, or nothing at all. Empowering the group leader in re-
lation to grading their peers produced mixed results in that they nonetheless 
tended to inflate their overall assessments of their peers. Another interest-
ing development that was noticed, perhaps not too surprisingly, related to

the manner by which the student groups approached the work to be done, 
namely dividing and outsourcing the deliverables such that each person was 
responsible for doing one aspect of the doc, rarely interacting, deliberating, 
or engaging with one another regarding each other’s work (as reported by 
the teaching assistants and facilitators). In some cases, participants appeared 
to have slapped their individual contribution onto the document without any 
sense of collaboration in thought or delivery as to the development of the 
document’s overall theme.
Despite having this pointed out in the feedback they received on their 
Google docs, the final editing processes were nonetheless a similar affair, 
with subsets of particularly motivated individuals picking up the slack of 
their group members and addressing the critiques raised (correcting overall 
style and grammar issues, strengthening thematic development and flow of 
the document, etc.). The seeming failure to produce the intended outcomes 
in light of the time and energy invested into the course design processes ini-
tially suggested that the majority of students had taken little away from the 
collaborative exercise—and perhaps had collaborated even less—than those 
in the previous semester.
Assessing Outcomes
Despite the fact that Twitter utterly failed during this latter semester, chang-
ing from the three-test format to group projects ostensibly provided a tem-
plate and opportunity for a wider range of student input, participation, and 
interaction. However, survey data suggested that, in addition to observing 
the outsourcing of our collaborative agenda, most groups, having been given 
a template by the instructor, simply ran with that template, making sure to 
deliver the same format and constituencies present in that example (akin to 
the aforementioned “induced participation”). Moreover, the fact that there 
remained certain members in almost every group who participated barely or 
not at all suggested that not all students were inclined to commandeer their 
own learning, even if given the chance, freedom, and encouragement to do so.
As for the weekly quizzes, the surveys revealed that many of the class 
members often skimmed the docs initially, utilizing the search component 
(Ctrl+F) during the quiz to more quickly arrive at the answer (in defense of 
such tactics, the Google docs were lengthy, many upward of 30 pages when 
printed, including embedded URL links and a time-limit for the quiz). As for 
the final exam (which was based upon 20 student-generated essays; approxi-
mately 20 pages), the survey revealed that the students had indeed studied 
these closely, with its design viewed favorably.
But outcomes are not always as they appear, apparently. For the course 
evaluations and survey data once again overwhelmingly reflected a strong

appreciation of the course and its design, many explicating (voluntarily) at 
length how it had changed what their university experience meant, and how 
it had impacted their thinking on the development of their professional future. 
Similarly, a majority of students expressed gratitude for the use of inclusive 
technologies and collaborative strategies which had profoundly impacted not 
only their thinking and how they saw the world, but how they saw the poten-
tial for a general education course in their education. And in the two weeks 
following the course, the instructor/teaching assistants/facilitators received 
over 55 unsolicited emails, letters, and office visits reinforcing this impres-
sion of the pedagogical outcomes.
CONCLUSION
What an instructor accomplishes (or not) in any venture is never immedi-
ately apparent. But what he or she strives for is essential toward producing 
any desired outcome. And what was apparent in the data collected (both 
solicited and unsolicited) was that the reconfigured approach to this course 
had profoundly unsettled student expectations and sentiments regarding 
the purpose of their education in general, general education courses in 
particular, the subject matter at hand, and their foundational conceptions 
of their civic identity and professional goals. Whether the impact will be 
lasting and the outcomes tangible remains to be studied. But the complexity 
and passion by which these sentiments were expressed was unprecedented, 
remarkable, and rewarding, for it was clear that the course had uniquely 
garnered students’ attention and profoundly stimulated their thinking, forc-
ing reconsiderations for researchers perhaps of how “active” participation 
is conceived and studied in course designs. The survey data revealed that 
exploring the possibilities for the design of a large lecture course—which 
provided unique spaces for interpolating and validating student identity and 
engagement—had significantly stimulated the possibilities for its meaning 
for the students as well as their mental engagement with its overarching 
and unfolding themes, concepts, and intentions. To the point, the larger 
purpose—to stimulate critical thinking that would resonate beyond their 
experience in the classroom and unsettle the normal dynamics of their 
education—including the purpose of the general education class—had been 
largely and demonstrably achieved, with a majority of students reinforcing 
this conclusion by explicitly stating on their course evaluations that this was 
what they had always envisioned the college experience of courses to be—
namely an experience to broaden their thinking in profound and enriching 
ways that would transcend the parameters of the course.

What educators can take away from this exercise is this: the goals and ac-
complishments instructors seek to enact in educational practices are a function 
of their willingness to confront their own conceptions of education as agents in 
sets of systemic forces. To stimulate meaningful educational experiences, they 
must lead by example, pushing themselves into the unknown intrepidly much 
as they desire their students to do likewise. This means engaging the students 
on the terms and perspectives they bring to class, as well as honestly grappling 
with the very dynamics that comprise contemporary large-lecture classrooms. 
New media as a function of daily life and education will only increase. Tradi-
tional conceptions and practices of education cannot be preserved by simply 
ignoring these developments or trying to control them through restrictive class-
room policies, for that misses the point of liberal education—namely, how to 
teach students to effectively engage the world they will live in, with principles, 
sense, and sensitivity. But while there is no going backwards, instructors must 
also resist the urge to either simply embrace the power and potential of social 
media uncritically or sacrifice higher intentions in the face of such change.
Rather, instructors must adapt and acclimate their principles into new prac-
tices which utilize the challenges they confront in this new media environ-
ment as a means not only to reassert the educational values they hold dear but 
also their potential to be achieved in novel—if sometimes confusing—ways. 
But by taking the risk to collectively explore how the tenets of the dominant 
educational paradigm might be effectively challenged through their agency 
within its dynamics, instructors open the door to more successfully inspir-
ing their students to do the same—by example—in their educational and 
professional development in ways which are not only revolutionary but truly 
emancipatory as well.

Chapter Six
Tweeting 101: Twitter and 
the College Classroom
Alec R. Hosterman
Since this chapter concerns the popular social media Twitter, here is an at-
tempt to tweet an abstract of it using the obligatory 140-character maximum:
Unique Twittr users create digital class spaces, asking?s, sending links, & rede-
fining modes of comm. Also, +/– of Twttr, & best practices
Although admirable, it does show that not everything is tweetable. Com-
municators must choose the most appropriate mode of communication for 
their goal at hand, and obviously this was not the best choice. Whether it is 
face-to-face communication or merely something scrawled on the back of a 
napkin, the goal is to match the message with the mode in order to achieve a 
successful communication act.
Beginning in 2009, “social media” and “social networking” were the 
phrases du jour. Outlets like Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Blogger, Aca-
demia.edu, Ning, and LinkedIn gained popularity as the primary means of 
connecting and communicating with participants. Face-to-face was out. The 
napkin was in. Modes of communicating were changing, as they do with 
every new technological turn.
One of those sites, Twitter, gives users a unique way to communicate in-
formation in discrete bits, and useful for those who might not have a conven-
tional voice in their community or want to be heard on different levels or for 
different reasons. Film critic Roger Ebert is a prime example. After losing his 
ability to speak due to cancer, Ebert (2010) turned to blogging and Twitter. In 
his June 11, 2010, journal entry, he noted:
I said Twitter represented the end of civilization. It now represents a part of 
civilization I live in. . . . Twitter for me performs the function of a running

conversation. For someone who cannot speak, it allows a way to unload my 
zingers and one-liners. (para. 1)
For Ebert, Twitter is his new and unique voice among many in the digital 
jungle of social media outlets. And like quite a few others, users have found 
themselves engaging Twitter for different reasons, from keeping up with their 
favorite performing artists to getting the latest deals on Amazon.com to com-
municating with their friends and family.
To some, Twitter is just a waste of time. However, others see Twitter as a 
medium with potential in the new arsenal of digital communication strategies 
that are available to connected users. If utilized with forethought, Twitter can 
be a valuable and useful resource in the social media stratosphere.
This chapter explored the reach of Twitter and its different users. Because 
this is rather broad, this chapter focused on its use within the educational set-
ting of the college classroom. To this end, the chapter discussed the relatively 
quick rise to popularity of Twitter and the different types of Twitter users, 
explored two different approaches to using Twitter in the classroom, and of-
fered suggestions on how instructors and students can productively utilize 
Twitter in class.
THE RISE OF TWITTER AS ONE OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA
Twitter is categorized as a microblogging web application that allows users to 
connect to one another through tweets. Tweets are short 140-character mes-
sages that are sent publicly to individuals (commonly called followers), or 
privately via direct messages (much like e-mail). Those who send messages 
are commonly called tweeters or twitterers. Tweeters answer a simple ques-
tion: “What are you doing?”; this prompt helps facilitate the creation of de-
centralized, open social networks as opposed to centralized, closed networks. 
Some people just follow other tweeters, looking at their tweet stream for 
interesting information, but others engage in conversations they find compel-
ling or valuable for some reason.
Twitter was first conceived of and developed by software engineer Jack 
Dorsey through his podcasting company, Odeo, Inc. (which later became the 
Obvious Corp.). Dorsey’s goal in creating the service was to be able to com-
pete in the SMS (Short Message Service) market. In March of 2006, Dorsey 
sent the first official test tweet of his service: “just setting up my twttr” (twttr 
being the short form of Twitter). Later that year, Dorsey and Evan Williams 
established Twitter.com and hired the familiar social media icons of Biz 
Stone and several others to help run the company. In April of 2007, Twitter 
incorporated itself, becoming the organization it is today (Glaser, 2007).

Tweeting 101 
95
In 2006 and 2007, Twitter held steady at a few million tweets per day. In 
2008, awareness of Twitter by Americans 12 years and older was just at 5%. 
In January of 2009 though, the service began to boom in the marketplace 
and by January of 2010 it exploded to upwards of 10 million tweets per day. 
This explosion was not without consequences, most notably the inability 
to handle the amount of tweets sent and the inclusion of the infamous Fail 
Whale (Schroeder, 2009). Twitter has over 105 million registered users, an 
87% awareness among those 12 years and older, attracts 190 million visitors 
per month, and generates 65 million tweets per day (Edison Research, 2010; 
Schonfeld, 2010). And by the time you read this, these statistics will probably 
be different in some manner. This is the ever-changing nature of social media.
Twitter’s growth and immense popularity has produced a plethora of 
third-party applications that allow users to access their accounts from smart 
phones and portable media devices as well as their computers, both PC and 
Mac (desktop and laptop). Several of the more popular programs include 
TweetDeck, Nambu (currently only for Mac), Seesmic, HootSuite, Twit-
telator, and Twitterific. In addition, there are services like bit.ly and tinyurl.
com that shorten URLs for tweets; and Twitpic, Yfrog, or TwitVid that post 
photos and/or videos (Faculty Focus, 2010). Twitter has spawned its own 
cottage industry, carving out a niche for those specializing in microblogging.
But with each and every new medium come its proponents and its crit-
ics. As Thompson (2007) writes: “Critics sneer at Twitter and Dodgeball as 
hipster narcissism, but the real appeal of Twitter is almost the inverse of nar-
cissism. It’s practically collectivist—you’re creating a shared understanding 
larger than yourself” (para 9). It is this idea of experiencing the creation of 
relationships and its prominence in the social milieu that is indeed intriguing. 
Dorsey and his crew were probably not thinking that Twitter was going to 
be a commonplace term among our conversational lexicons, something right 
up there with Facebook’s liked and friending or Google’s google. But that is 
what it has become. That is the power of a popular social media tool expand-
ing within the digital marketplace.
Scholarly research on Twitter exists, but it is limited. The early studies 
demonstrated that Twitter is used to create communities of connected indi-
viduals (Java, Song, Finin, & Tseng, 2007), as an outlet for reporting news 
in different mediated outlets (Fahri, 2009; Ahmad, 2010), and as a new type 
of research tool (Ovadia, 2009). As Twitter gained in popularity in 2010, the 
number of research articles published that year also increased. Studies have 
focused on how Twitter is used in international political campaigns (Grant, 
Moon, & Busby, 2010; Ifukor, 2010), in the educational setting as related to 
communicating with faculty and students (Dillon, 2010; Junco, Heibergert, & 
Loken, 2010), as a social media tool for self-reflection in education (Wright,

Alec R. Hosterman
2010), as a tool for public relations practitioners communicating with dif-
ferent audiences (Greysen, Kind, & Chretien, 2010; Rybalko & Seltzer, 
2010; Smith, 2010; Xifra & Grau, 2010), in religion and the sharing in of 
spiritual experiences and grief (Sanderson & Cheong, 2010; Yust, Hyde, & 
Ota, 2010), as a channel for communicating during conference presentations 
(DeVoe, 2010; Jennings, 2010), and as a social media tool that is redefining 
our understanding of mass communication (Napoli, 2010).
Most of this research concentrates on how Twitter is now being used in 
particular professions, such as journalism, public relations, or education; or 
where Twitter has become a useful tool for communicating to (or with) a 
body of participants, such as religion or education. What is missing is the 
way in which Twitter either impacts or acts as a communication medium, 
and thereby the effect it has on us as rhetorical beings. Questions need to 
be asked:
•  How will Twitter affect our ability to communicate in face-to-face situations?
• How will it affect traditional modes of written communication?
• How does Twitter function rhetorically?
What we know for sure is how impressively quickly Twitter has woven itself 
into the mediated fabric of our contemporary culture. It has become a main-
stay in social circles, businesses, newspapers, politics, and educational venues 
worldwide. It is here to stay . . . at least until something better comes along.
TWITTER USERS
So who tweets? Interestingly enough, the champion of Twitter is not what 
Palfrey and Gasser (2008) call the digital native: those “born after 1980, when 
social digital technologies . . . came online” (p. 1). Nor is it just the business-
savvy advertising executive. Twitter is used by businesses, government agen-
cies, professors, journalists, and public relations practitioners. Parents and 
grandparents are also getting on the Twitter bandwagon, as are celebrities and 
media personalities alike. Twitter is everywhere, spreading faster than gossip 
about a celebrity foible.
But who exactly is tweeting and why are they doing it? This is something 
that public opinion research companies are beginning to ask themselves 
(among other things). According to a 2010 Pew Internet & American Life 
Project (Smith & Rainie, 2010) research report (run by the Pew Research 
Center), 8% of American adults who go online use Twitter. Also, young

Tweeting 101

adults (18–29) are more likely to use Twitter than older adults; minorities 
(African Americans and Latinos) are twice as likely to use Twitter as white 
users; and urban residents are twice as likely to use Twitter as rural users. 
Finally, 24% of Twitter users check their account several times per day, while 
21% never check it (Smith & Rainie, 2010).
And what do tweeters tweet? Again, according to the Pew (Smith & 
Rainie, 2010) report, here are the top categories:
Updates to personal life, activities or interests; Work-related activities; Sharing 
links to news stories; Posting humorous or philosophical observations about 
life; Re-tweet material from other tweeters; Send messages to people; Share 
photos and videos; and Tweet their location
In other words, people tweet pretty much anything and everything. An article 
on Bit Rebels tries to answer this question from a non-scientific perspective. 
Belardo (2010) delineates seven different types of tweeters, including:
The Content Provider; The Twitter DJs; The Retweeter; The Time and Weather 
Announcers; The Quotes and Inspiration Giver; The Help Brigade; and The 
Conversationalist
Although these categories were not discerned by any formal research meth-
odology per se, it is an important step forward in better understanding the 
Twitter user.
Prolific usage of Twitter since 2008 has allowed for three distinct typolo-
gies of users to be anecdotally identified in tweet streams (the stream is the 
daily tweets sent by those followed). These include the literalists, the net-
workers, and the facilitators. (To help describe these typologies, examples 
from actual users are provided and taken from http://www.twitter.com. An 
individual’s tweet is denoted by the @ symbol and their username.)
The first type of tweeter the Literalist takes the site’s charge literally: 
they tweet what they are actually doing or thinking at any given moment. A 
tweet from actor Ashton Kutcher (@aplusk) illustrates the literalist’s posi-
tion: “In case you are wondering what’s going on I’m doing a twitterview 
with @TIME.” A recent commercial for a major cell phone provider pokes 
fun at literalists. The parents of two digital native siblings are sitting on their 
house’s front porch, tweeting “sitting on the front porch” to their followers. 
Predictably, their children are rolling their eyes in embarrassment from their 
parent’s lack of Twitter protocol.
There is a certain pleasure for followers in reading a well-constructed, 
literal post. Sometimes it is inspiring to know where someone is located at 
that moment in time, like “walking along the beach watching the sunset,”

Alec R. Hosterman
“enjoying the evening listening to Bach,” or @seanzdenek tweeting “80 
degrees today. Beat that!” from Lubbock, TX on December 21st.
On the other hand, some people take the literalist position to the extreme, 
tweeting their exact physical actions like “drinking beer” or “eating dinner” 
or even “using the restroom.” A recent function added to the Twitter account 
is the ability to post location information of the tweet (and by extension, the 
twitterer). The tweet includes a location map of either your general location 
(town or neighborhood) or specific location (latitude/longitude coordinates). 
With issues and discussions of Internet privacy at an all-time high, this fea-
ture is something a user must enable rather than it being the default.
Finally, the literalist’s tweets can also act as agent to a cause, inspiring 
some to action or bring about thoughts long ago forgotten. For instance, 
@spinuzzi tweeted “Grading undergrads’ reports from their field research. 
Some really nice work here,” while @bethaniqua tweeted “I think it’s likely 
that people can agree on what’s bad writing, but excellent writing is a matter 
of taste.” Viewing this through the lens of rhetorical scholar Burke (1969), 
these tweets acted as both agency (how an act is done) and purpose (why the 
act is done), two important factors underlying many users’ tweets.
A second type of user engages Twitter to act as a digital gatekeeper of in-
formation called Networkers. These types of users are typified by the RT phe-
nomenon. RT, or re-tweet (also spelled retweet), is the mark used to identify 
a tweet that is not an original thought from that user, rather they are simply 
passing along someone else’s tweet. Re-tweeting is usually an indicator of that 
person’s desire to share the wealth, so to speak. Steve Rubel (@steverubel), 
Mashable (@mashable), and Alyssa Milano (@alyssa_milano) are all tweet-
ers that embody this practice. For instance, @mashable tweeted this, “FCC’s 
Net Neutrality Order Finally Passes, Many Disappointed,” while @alyssa_
milano tweeted “Check out @XXXXX for live pics of the #Lunareclipse /via 
@XXXXX.” The hashtag (the # symbol in front of a word or phrase) allows 
users to quickly look up all tweets with that same tag, engaging the research 
function of Twitter. It is the hope that the tweet re-tweeted will fall into the 
tweet stream of someone who can use the information to their advantage, solve 
a problem, or fill an information void of sorts.
Networkers are also about strengthening bonds and creating new relation-
ships where ones did not exist prior. They may include a simple note in 
addition to the message re-tweeted, but networkers want the focus to be on 
the content of the original message, not their note (that would be second-
ary). As gatekeepers, they can also be classified as the third type, facilitators, 
feeding upon the desire and knowledge of those out there in the known (and 
unknown) Twitterverse.

This third user type is different than the other two in that they are using 
Twitter as a means to communicate directly between tweeters, as opposed to 
just sending out random thoughts to anyone listening or merely passing on 
information from another party. This third type is referred to as Facilitators 
because they utilize Twitter as a means to both enrich and augment their 
traditional face-to-face or other mediated communications. Facilitators ask 
and answer questions, provide links, argue, offer commentary, follow up on 
statements, begin and add to conversations, and the like. For them, Twitter 
becomes a tool that enables immediacy among vast virtual networks of indi-
viduals and groups.
In creating, maintaining, and enhancing their online relationships, fa-
cilitators see Twitter as a means to an end of sorts. Tweets are perceived 
as part of the transactional dialogue between multiple participants in a 
de-centralized digital network. For instance, @daniellestern tweeted to a 
student: “As with the recent assignments, I do have feedback if you’d like 
to stop by my office in spring to discuss.” Likewise, @janetnews tweeted 
to a friend: “Let’s see a pic! Am having hard time imagining this . . . what 
do the spreadsheets contain?”
Facilitators are managers of information, of relationships, and of tact. They 
know how and why Twitter manages the communication process and uses 
it to their advantage. Likewise, they see Twitter as an extension of face-to-
face communication, not something that totally supplants it. For instance, 
@billiehara tweeted the following to a colleague: “matrix of domination? 
interesting concept. Do you have sources?”, and @daniellestern tweeted her 
thanks to someone after a post face-to-face encounter: “thanks for bringing a 
fresh, invigorated perspective to the #csca10 panel.” Entertainment icons can 
also be facilitators. Writer Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) exemplifies this as he 
has conversations with his friends, wife, and fans.
Are we always just a literalist, networker, or facilitator? No, we move 
among the three based upon our need and intent. Like any competent com-
municator might do in a traditional face-to-face encounter, tweeters alter 
their approach depending on the actual context they come in contact with in 
their tweet stream. Some people, though, use Twitter for the distinct purpose 
of providing information on new products or tweet random thoughts. They 
inhabit one typology dominantly but can switch depending on purpose. The 
user @spinuzzi has a plethora of random thoughts on his bus rides to and 
from work, while reading, cooking, or any number of other actions. For in-
stance: “The Hulk seems to have a lot of Twitter accounts.” Obviously this 
is not to anyone in particular and is there for consumption as-is. However, 
he does re-tweet information he deems valuable to his followers or interact

Alec R. Hosterman
with them if they ask questions using the @ function (you can direct a public 
message to a particular person, and it will appear as a mention, by putting the 
@ symbol in front of their username).
Another example of this flexibility and adaptability comes from @tengrrl. 
She takes the facilitator role to a new level in that she sends comments to 
friends and colleagues as well as herself (i.e., “Must. Do. More. Writing. Write. 
Write. Write.”). However, she also has two other accounts: @newsfromtengrrl 
tweets relevant information about composition and literacy in the news (i.e., 
“Yes We Can: The Case for the Editorial We—The Subversive Copy Editor 
Blog”), while @bedfordbits tweets composition and language assignments or 
projects (i.e., “What makes something funny? Use Stephen Colbert’s videos to 
help AP students explore the rhetoric of humor”). These two accounts (separate 
from her personal account) allow her to utilize Twitter mainly as both a facili-
tator and a networker, strengthening the knowledge base of her followers and 
communicating with others in a more traditional manner.
Understanding the types of  users is much like utilizing Kolb’s (1984) 
learning styles (concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract con-
ceptualization, and active experimentation) or experimenting with the ways 
in which students encounter and utilize new knowledge (visually, aurally, 
tactilely, etc.). If we understand the different modes that tweeters utilize, then 
the better prepared we are to actually use Twitter in the classroom, both from 
a student’s perspective and from an instructor’s. The next section illustrates 
this point, as it examines the use of Twitter in the college classroom, in both 
undergraduate and graduate settings.
TWITTER IN ACTION
This section begins with several stereotypical assumptions identified about 
college tweeters, both undergraduate and graduate. First, there’s the assump-
tion that because college students are digital natives they must naturally 
gravitate toward using all new digital technologies as soon as they become 
available (and accessible) in the marketplace. This is not always the case. 
Granted, there are some digital natives who will stand in line for the debut 
of a new Apple product or video game release, but for the most part being 
a digital native does not equate with the desire to own all things new with 
communication technologies. Nor does it mean that if given the technology, 
digital natives know instinctively how to use it. People are not genetically 
predisposed to being able to use (or not use) technology.
Second, because graduate students tend to be older than traditional college-
aged students (18–25), they prefer to employ more traditional forms of com-

munication rather than newer, trendier forms. This is also not the case. Twit-
ter appeals to a wide range of users, young and old alike. In the second case 
study below, a doctoral student in her 50s went from writing notes on a piece 
of paper to using Twitter on a daily basis. Age is not a determining factor in 
one’s ability to use this technology.
Put simply, genetics and age are not factors in whether technology is ad-
opted. Its usefulness as a communicative tool is what is important. As Faculty 
Focus’ 2010 Twitter Survey notes: a “growing number of professors are using 
Twitter as a way to connect with like-minded peers from around the country 
(or world), as a new teaching tool to keep students engaged, or as a real-time 
news source” (p. 4). And yes, even professors are using it!
Searching for new and innovative ways to reach their students, instructors 
are turning to new media technologies like Twitter in order to enrich their 
lectures and further topical discussions related to their teaching. Instructors 
are learning and teaching students the necessity of understanding the imme-
diacy of the tweet and its reach, which is different than that of any traditional 
or modern forms of digital communication. Naturally, with new technolo-
gies come new questions. Will it work? Will students use it? How will it get 
integrated into the class? How will students get assessed on their tweeting? 
Monica Rankin, Professor of History at the University of Texas at Dallas, is 
one such professor who understood the questions and still took the plunge 
early on (Rankin, 2010).
Wanting to experiment with social media, Rankin adopted Twitter for 
her basic U.S. History II survey course. Not knowing much about it, she 
had a graduate teaching assistant chronicle her semester-long experiment, 
by creating a short documentary of Rankin’s class called The Twitter Ex-
periment (available on YouTube). While two days per week were focused on 
traditional pedagogical methods, Rankin devoted a third day to group work 
using Twitter, primarily as a means to engage 90+ students and have them 
participate in discussions. To do this, she grouped students and allowed them 
to tweet questions and comments. She then had a live tweet stream from 
Tweetdeck projected onto a screen, allowing her to answer the questions and 
thus participate with students. Interestingly enough, she refers to these days 
as Twitter discussions, implying a dialogical frame of mind when using Twit-
ter (Rankin, 2010). Overall, Rankin thought the experiment was a success, in 
part, because “it encouraged students to engage who otherwise would not” 
(para 14, 2010).
But Rankin (2010) is not alone in early adoption. Danielle Stern, Assistant 
Professor of Communication Studies at Christopher Newport University, 
uses Twitter in her popular culture classes. In a personal communication, she 
noted: “Twitter is more of a learning tool & a quick way to stay in touch with

students.” Also, it “helps students get ideas for course discussion, blog posts 
and projects” (personal communication, December 12, 2010). Likewise, Cole 
Camplese, Director of Education-Technology Services at Pennsylvania State 
University in University Park, utilized Twitter as a second level of commu-
nication for students to tweet observations or ask questions. It was his hope 
that “the second layer of conversation will disrupt the old classroom model 
and allow new kinds of teaching in which students play a greater role and 
information is pulled in from outside the classroom walls” (Young, 2009, 
para 5). Finally, Howard Rheingold, technology and media professor for 
University of California, Berkeley, and social media professor for Stanford 
University, has his students “employ Twitter for a kind of group contact that 
he describes as ‘student-to-teacher-to-student ambient office hours,’ during 
which he shares information not on the syllabus, such as videos or reading 
notes” (Miners, 2010, para 6). It is this verve for experimenting with technol-
ogy and teaching that allows students to see the potential for the tool to move 
beyond a literalist position and well into the facilitator.
What follows are two case studies to better demonstrate how Twitter can 
be utilized as a teaching tool. Both instances are based on classroom experi-
ences, one as an instructor teaching an undergraduate course and the other as 
a doctoral student program that has a focus on technology.
CASE STUDY 1: USING TWITTER 
WITH UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS
In the fall of 2008, a 400-level Political Communication course was taught 
at a midsize, midwestern university. With it being a presidential election 
year, the focus of the class was on the communicative aspects of the politi-
cal campaigns. With eight students, Twitter was only a small project among 
several assigned to the students, just 5% of their final grade. Students were 
requested to follow each other and the professor, thus creating a private 
virtual network.
Throughout the course of the semester, the class discussed varying 
communication strategies of the campaign between now-President Barack 
Obama and Senator John McCain. Students ended up using Twitter in sev-
eral different ways:
•  To augment in-class discussions. On many occasions, the class would have 
very spirited discussions about class material. Students would go home and 
think about what was discussed, oftentimes tweeting their thoughts at all 
hours of the day (and night).

103
•  To do “live tweeting” during the presidential debates. The class ran unof-
ficial Twitter parties during the presidential and vice-presidential debates. 
With everyone at their respective homes or varying locations, the class 
would tweet comments or questions as the debates were going on. In a 
sense, this created a virtual classroom wherein the class debated answers 
and nonverbal strategies by the candidates.
•  To pose questions or debate classmates. Along with being in the course 
came a responsibility to respect each other’s political opinions, regardless 
of how divergent the students may be. And students did this. Students used 
Twitter as a means to engage in dialogue and productive arguments outside 
the classroom while still adhering to the standards set forth early on.
•  To provide links to supporting material. Many times, students would post 
links to articles or material they came in contact with, either to help some-
one else in their projects or to prove what it was they were trying to say in 
class or in a previous tweet.
In the end, students felt the class would not have been as rich in comments, 
engagement, or learning if Twitter had not been a part of the overall experi-
ence. Not only did they use Twitter in a way the professor did not imagine 
at the start of the semester, but also they showed how important a commu-
nication device it was in the learning process. This demonstrated the role of 
the tweeter (literalist, networker, and facilitator) as an important aspect of 
classroom communication.
CASE STUDY 2: USING TWITTER 
WITH GRADUATE STUDENTS
Annually, students enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Technical Communication 
and Rhetoric at Texas Tech University go to Lubbock, Texas, for two weeks. 
In that time they interact with fellow students and faculty, attend classes and 
professional development workshops, and participate in a mock academic con-
ference. The graduate students see the summer exchange as a necessary tool for 
a successful life in the academy and on the conference circuit.
The goal of the mock conference, specifically, is to give graduate students 
practical experience presenting their research in front of an educated audience 
along with providing them the ability to improve their presentation abilities. 
After a student presents, the audience (made up of fellow students and fac-
ulty members in the program) would engage the speaker with questions or 
dialogue. After that, the audience would critique the student’s presentations, 
pointing out items for them to improve on in future presentations.

Alec R. Hosterman
Because students spent significant time preparing and then presenting their 
mock presentations, feedback was seen as capital for improving and captur-
ing some of the “it” factor that traditional face-to-face doctoral students re-
ceive. At first it was easy with only 8 students in the program: feedback was 
in-depth and immediate. But with each incoming cohort, the bar was raised 
ever so slightly. By 2009, almost 50 students were scheduled to give presen-
tations. To facilitate this important communication act, Twitter emerged as a 
digital resource for students and faculty.
Because so many students were already on Twitter, that summer the stu-
dents decided to experiment with digital feedback. As students gave their pre-
sentations, the audience would listen and post commentary to Twitter using a 
uniform hashtag (#mayseminar). Overall, there were three different types of 
commentary given: research references (@seanzdenek tweeted: “Johnston’s 
Samoan study forthcoming in J. of Intercultural Comm. Awesome!”), content 
feedback (@digital_julie tweeted: “I like your observation that random noise 
builds social capital and establishes the tweeter as an individual”), and gen-
eral feedback, usually about the presenter or presentation itself (@konstanze 
tweeted: “Technology NOT for technology’s sake but rather as a means for 
accomplishing a goal <- motivation at play”).
However, one doctoral student decided to forgo the Twitter experiment 
and do things using traditional paper and pen. After each presentation she 
would write down comments and hand deliver them to the presenter. Many 
saw it as a unique and personal gesture, one not done often in this day and 
age. When asked, she remarked that she did not want to lug around the tech-
nology or engage in the hassle of being torn away from the presentation: 
“But as I took notes, I realized that the only difference was that I was using 
a pencil and they were using something electronic” (personal communica-
tion, October 11, 2010). The student realized the end result was the same: 
providing feedback; it was merely a different medium that communicated 
the message.
During those two weeks, the tweets generated a unique online commu-
nity for faculty and students. Likewise, it created a digital repository of 
data that both the presenter and the audience could mine if needed. Using 
Twitter, this rhetorical community provided benefits beyond that of the 
presentations themselves. Therefore, if these students could capitalize on 
this technology, why can’t other graduate classes or seminars use Twitter 
it to their advantage?
Using Twitter was a new experience for students and faculty. It enabled 
invaluable commentary and provided resources that augmented face-to-face 
feedback. Twitter also made the process a transactional experience that was 
far more useful and permanent than the quick debriefings from the past. In

short, technology was utilized in much the same way as traditional face-to-
face conversations because that was the intent of the communicator, a neces-
sary factor in the overall experience.
TWITTER BEST PRACTICES
Instructors at the helm of 21st-century learning know that change is inevitable. 
Instructors are challenging themselves in creating new pedagogical strategies 
for reaching the ever-connected college student. As Rankin (2010) remarks 
on her own teaching, “I think it is absolutely essential that educators consider 
new approaches and new technologies in the classroom. I consider my own 
teaching strategies to be in a constant state of creation and re-creation” (para 
15, 2010). This change is coming at a time when digital communications are 
emerging as tools of new media.
Twitter is enriched by the promiscuous growth of such things as smart 
phone applications and cloud computing. It embraces the ideas of Computer-
Mediated Communication (CMC) but moves beyond the “computer” aspect 
of CMC since Twitter can function on cell phones, smart phones, mobile 
devices (i.e., iPod Touch, iPad, etc.) or computers. In a sense, Twitter has 
come about at just the right time in the development of one-to-many digital 
communications.
As discussed previously, Twitter has immense potential to augment the 
college classroom, both as a tool of learning and a tool of communication. 
Suggestions abound from faculty in most every discipline. As such, here 
are some that work best to help both instructor and student (Parry, 2008; 
Hosterman, 2009; Wolff, 2009). To begin, instructors might use Twitter to 
do the following:
•  Create a closed virtual network so students have a place to dialogue with 
one another or the instructor without the rest of the digital world “listening.”
•  Pose questions or elicit comments from students, either to be answered in-
class or outside as homework.
• Distribute assignments or projects to students.
• Provide immediate feedback on student work.
• Have students write assignments, such as poetry or short stories.
•  Use it as a reminder service for upcoming deadlines, events, exams or 
the like.
• Use it as a public notepad for taking or sharing notes on presentations.
•  Use it to provide teachable moments to students, utilizing links to items that 
augment what it is they’re learning.

Alec R. Hosterman
Students could then use Twitter in response to the previous items or use it to:
•  Work out thoughts or ideas discussed in class, bouncing them off class-
mates or other followers.
• Keep a journal of thoughts or reactions to particular topics.
•  Work on spelling, grammar, and clarity of thought (especially since 140 
characters forces users to concentrate on choosing just the right word to 
convey exactly what they mean).
• As a research tool, utilizing keywords or trends.
• To understand virtual crowd sourcing.
• Attend events and tweet their reactions (only if appropriate, naturally).
• To brainstorm ideas with groups or individuals.
•  Network with professionals in a given field, either by following them or 
engaging them in conversations.
• Interview people.
• Post photographs or short videos (through a third-party service).
Using Twitter should be more than just a simple assignment added to fill up 
time during the semester. It needs to be used with conscious forethought and 
purpose. To develop the use of Twitter in classes further, it is advantageous to 
go beyond just surface use. Rather, one should engage it like they would any 
other pedagogical tool. Sherblom (2010) outlines aspects to what instructors 
can do to facilitate learning in a CMC classroom.
Media Richness. The ability to tweet is one thing (it’s rather straightfor-
ward to use), but using all of the aspects of it in order to enrich a student’s 
learning experience is at the heart of this characteristic. A tweet containing 
links is one example. So is re-tweeting with comments. The more avenues 
that enhance the message, the more it creates a media rich tool.
Social Presence and Identity. Twitter enables one to create a sense of 
immediacy between user and followers. The simple act of answering ques-
tions or giving credit to something re-tweeted will help students envision 
themselves as actually engaging and creating solutions to the problems and 
questions posed by the teacher. In turn, managing a Twitter presence will en-
able users to create an ethos associated with their Twitter handle, either as a 
literalist, networker, or facilitator.
Social Information and Processing. Having students respond and work 
through questions posed on Twitter, for example, not only engages them in 
course material, but it allows them to interact with fellow students and solve 
problems on their own. It is this fostering of positive experiences with tech-
nology that teaches students to critically assess the tool from the message, 
and how to use other social media to their advantage when the need arises.

CONCLUSION
There exists a plethora of opportunities for using Twitter in the college class-
room, both for undergraduate and graduate students. As a communicative de-
vice, Twitter can explore ideas, connect participants, or extend discussions. As 
a research tool, Twitter can provide insight to groups of people and understand 
their attitudes and behaviors. And as the 2011 democratic movement in Egypt 
showed media, it could be a window into events happening around the world, 
providing firsthand viewpoints where big media might not be able to go.
For writers, Twitter can help to become better at one’s craft. As Wolff 
(2009) notes, “using Twitter in Information Architecture reinforced my belief 
that micro-blogging is an important communication medium and as such it is 
important for burgeoning writers to understand it both theoretically and prac-
tically” (para 2). From message construction to message editing, Twitter’s 
simple 140-character maximum forces users to choose just the right word to 
convey their intended meaning.
Academic research has been paying attention to social media for a while 
now, however given Twitter’s recent rise in popularity, very limited formal 
research exists. But that is okay. As this was being written, several calls to 
take surveys for formal research were circulating among the listservs. Un-
doubtedly, there will soon be a dearth of scholarship by the time this book is 
published. And that is a good thing. Understanding how users consume Twit-
ter and what they do with it enables teachers and scholars to better understand 
the fields of new media and cyber culture. As Microsoft founder and philan-
thropist Bill Gates remarks: “I’m a great believer that any tool that enhances 
communication has profound effects in terms of how people can learn from 
each other, and how they can achieve the kind of freedoms they’re interested 
in” (Coley, 2009, para 2).
Chapters like these also function to spark curiosity and potential areas of 
inquiry that scholars may pursue in the near future. For instance, what are 
the short and long-term effects of Twitter’s use on writing style? Does Twit-
ter’s 140-character maximum affect the way in which people comprehend 
messages? Do participants feel more engaged with followers as a result of 
using Twitter? Does using Twitter diminish or increase relationships among 
people? And how does Twitter affect our rhetorical nature as human beings? 
Or, as Orenstein (2010) posits, “Each Twitter post seemed a tacit referendum 
on who I am, or at least who I believe myself to be” (para 3). Issues of identity 
construction and maintenance are wrapped up in one’s Twitter identity, much 
like any other form of public communication, mediated or otherwise.
This chapter has also demonstrated that Twitter is much more than just an-
other fad. Rather, Twitter provides the potential for exploring new avenues.

Twitter has become as ubiquitous as a news station’s call letters, web address, 
or sign off. It is a way of communicating with a public that is ever divergent 
and going in multiple directions. To wit, does this imply that Twitter is part 
of the cause or part of the solution? Only time will tell.
What is known is that as a social media, Twitter has (in its very short ex-
istence) has changed the ways in which people communicate, breaking down 
walls and opening up new avenues for users and followers alike. Understand-
ing its reach in the classroom will not only help us teach but will also help us 
learn. After all, docendo discimus . . . “by teaching, we learn.”

Chapter Seven
Cultivating a Community of Learners: 
The Potential Challenges of 
Social Media in Higher Education
Lily Zeng, Holly Hall, and Mary Jackson Pitts
Social media have quickly evolved into thousands of sites and formats with 
limitless applications. They rely on consumer-generated content and are 
exemplified by interactivity and conversation. Gone is the need for highly 
educated, sophisticated technological gurus to serve as Internet gatekeepers. 
Ordinary people are now in control as the publishers and the implications of 
that power are still not fully understood or utilized.
Social media are looked upon by some as a cure-all for engagement and 
relationship-building issues. While social media have unquestionable ad-
vantages, there are an equal number of drawbacks, shortcomings and chal-
lenges in their successful implementation. In higher education, specifically, 
many are looking to social media to “cure” or at least mitigate issues such 
as student retention and engagement, the need for increased alumni dona-
tions and involvement, and to implement pedagogical changes to improve 
student learning. A University of Massachusetts survey found that colleges 
and universities are “adopting social media tactics faster than Fortune 500 
companies” (McDonald, 2009, p. 1).
Social media are, in many respects, enhancing our capability for dialogue 
and instruction in higher education institutions. This chapter examined the 
benefits and challenges of using social media, explored the possibilities of 
collaboration within and among the student, faculty, and alumni populations, 
and offered recommendations for social media use in higher education.

FACULTY
Two styles of communication have often been identified: transmission and 
ritual (Carey, 1989). Historically, institutions of higher learning have used the 
transmission style of communication. The teacher talks and the students take 
notes. The communication is often one-way with little interaction. To create 
a more ritual style of communication, interactivity is a requirement. In this 
style of communication, both participants groups, i.e., faculty and students, 
are actively involved in creating meaning. The process allows all participants 
to develop discussion and enhance understanding of difficult concepts and 
constructs. Often some of the best professors are those who have the ability 
to engage the students in discussions. The give-and-take during the instruc-
tion fosters learning. Many faculty know when a class went well and when it 
did not. An engaged classroom of learners is one where students talk, debate, 
discuss, and apply what they are learning. Creating an atmosphere where this 
occurs can be difficult. The engaged classroom is often one where the instruc-
tor uses many resources to create interaction in the classroom. Faculty who 
use social media to stay connected and up-to-date with researchers in their 
field of study are among the best faculty at an institution. Social media allow 
faculty members even at the smallest of schools to interact with faculty from 
across the world about topics central to their teaching and research.
Educators debate pedagogical styles and recognize that different methods 
of teaching can help and hinder learning. Instructional accountability is talked 
about in every state capitol in the country; legislators want tax dollars spent 
wisely and they want students to actually learn from the instruction provided. 
Assessment of student learning is often perceived on college campuses as 
onerous. However, as mandated by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) 
and other accrediting bodies, institutions must assess whether their students 
are learning. The best faculty seek ways to improve instruction and do not 
view assessment negatively.
Technology has often been used as a tool to reach students but not every 
faculty member is willing to adapt to change. An observation by a graduate 
student in a social media focus group accurately portrays the current state of 
teaching styles: “they (teachers) have to change if they want to keep up with 
the young crowd, but a lot of them don’t want to” (personal communication 
focus group participant, November 8, 2010). Administrators look favor-
ably upon faculty using technology tools to supplement the student learning 
process. Higher learning institutions have often rewarded faculty for using 
creative teaching activities, and they have strongly encouraged use of tech-
nology to deliver information. In the classroom, PowerPoint overpowered 
chalkboards and dry erase boards and then it became the faculty Web site that

took over some of this distribution of information. In these cases, the com-
munication was one-way . . . .teacher to student.
Multimedia became the next venue for distributing information. Smart 
classrooms advanced this concept and suddenly the classroom began to be-
come a TV show. How entertaining could the professor make the lecture? 
How much media could be used in the classroom to keep the student’s atten-
tion? Faculty sought more tools in their attempts to engage the student and 
began to use Blackboard as a tool of information delivery and as a supple-
ment to teaching. The Blackboard tool allows faculty to meet with students 
and students with peers to have a more interactive classroom external to the 
traditional classroom setting. Blackboard allows for tremendous amounts of 
information to be presented to the student with no limit to the paper and ink 
it would take to print the material. Other faculty went beyond Blackboard to 
create “The Teacher in Your Pocket,” using podcasting and vodcasting (a 
technology that allows users to subscribe to audio/video feeds and receive 
automatic updates to their computers or mobile devices) to supplement stu-
dent learning (Miles, 2009; Pitts, 2008; Pitts, 2010). Pitts (2010) used experi-
mental research and found that students who are exposed to podcasting and 
vodcasting score better in classrooms than students who do not have access 
to them. Yet at the end of the day, many faculty do not engage students with 
forms of communication such as social networking (Yang, 2009).
Awareness of social media is significant; actual use within the classroom 
is less impressive. Tinti-Kane, Seaman, and Levy (2010) report that 80% of 
college professors report they use social media and some 50% of professors 
say they use tools such as video, podcasts, and wikis in their classroom. Wi-
kis are Web sites that can be used by content creators such as students and 
faculty. Wikis allow professors and students to create their own community 
of information with interlinked Web pages edited and viewed through a Web 
browser. Wiki software allows all participants to share information. However, 
reality is the use of social media is very superficial. Findings show that only 
about 10% of faculty surveyed engage the students with these tools while 
the remainder use them as passive activities where students listen or watch 
a posted video but have no interaction with others. Some 33% of faculty use 
social media to communicate with colleagues and slightly fewer use social 
media to communicate with students. As one might expect, faculty teaching 
online classes are more likely to use social media to communicate with stu-
dents and other faculty than those teaching in the traditional classroom.
Among faculty users, YouTube is the most often used tool followed by 
Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter for communicating with students (Tinti-
Kane et al., 2010). Faculty report they ask students to use online media 
such as podcasts, vodcasts, blogs, and wikis as elements of their instruction.

Faculty strongly agreed with how valuable podcasting and vodcasting were 
to their teaching. Some professors believe the social media tools help to 
extend the classroom.
The informality of the venues encourages discussion, often from participants 
beyond the classroom. Social media make students feel connected. Social media 
also offer students another, sometimes-less-threatening unofficial communica-
tion venue. Students appear to be more willing to discuss assignments or pro-
vide notification for missed classes or class work on social media than they do 
in more formal venues. (Zibluk, personal communication, November 23, 2010)
Roblyer, McDaniel, Webb, Herman, and Witty (2010) suggest that the 
greatest angst arises from the differences between the platforms used by 
teachers and students. The authors believe social media can help as a “com-
munity building resource” (p. 134). Sharing of information is seen as one of 
the most important features that can be used in social media. Already some 
high schools in the country are using online media to communicate via blog-
ging, podcasts and vodcasts. As students move from secondary education 
to higher education, the expectation to be engaged with such learning tools 
becomes even more pronounced. Higher education faculty must come out of 
their ivory towers of education and use whatever tools are needed to increase 
learning, understanding, and application. Mazer, Murphy, and Simonds 
(2007) suggest that “teachers may enhance their credibility among students 
by signifying an understanding of contemporary student culture” (pp. 3–4); 
however, some students assert social media should be used with caution by 
faculty and students, “you should keep a boundary between your personal 
life and your professional life” (personal communication focus group partici-
pant, November 8, 2010). Someone who applies a grade to a student’s work 
should not necessarily have access to the personal life of the student. Some 
faculty recognize that Facebook can be used as a tool to connect to students, 
to get classroom information to students, and as somewhat of a mother who 
can remind students about due dates for class work. Roblyer et al. (2010) 
report students believe there is a level of convenience that is provided by 
Facebook, while faculty believe Facebook is not for education. Faculty in this 
study were more likely to check email regularly while students check email 
and Facebook equally. Using Facebook to reach classmates to work on class 
projects was the least common way for students to connect to their classroom 
peers. A study by Miller, Parsons, and Lifer (2010) found just the opposite 
with regard to Facebook. More than 60% of the respondents indicated they 
used Facebook to connect with students in a class.
From Carey’s (1989) viewpoint, communication is at its best when all 
people actively participate in the process. As in the oldest of classrooms,

it is dependent upon faculty willingness to adopt new pedagogical styles. 
As one faculty member put it, “Social media certainly have their limits. 
They are a fine supplement, but they are inappropriate as a primary com-
munication venue” (Zibluk, personal communication, November 23, 2010). 
While many students like Facebook connectivity, they do not necessarily 
like teachers who interact constantly with their students. One undergradu-
ate focus group member said of his teacher, “He commented too much, so I 
blocked him. He just got too much into my life. He just would not leave me 
alone and was commenting on all my stuff. It was a requirement that we be 
his friend on Facebook. And this teacher just took it too far” (Anonymous, 
personal communication, November 10, 2010). Privacy is perhaps the great-
est of challenges. Miller et al. (2010) found students indicate they were least 
comfortable knowing that potential employers and faculty could view their 
profiles. As one student put it, “You have your personal life and then your 
school life and those kind of stay separate” (Anonymous, personal commu-
nication, November 10, 2010). Likewise, some faculty hold similar feelings 
about the separation of their personal life and their private life. Faculty and 
students can certainly avoid this concern if they simply do not post materials 
that are personal.
Any technology or software can be used for good or bad. The user makes 
the decision on how he/she uses it in cultivating a community of learners. 
Social media are here to stay and will only become more advanced. Admin-
istrators should encourage faculty to use creative teaching styles . . . whether 
social media are a part of that style is left to the faculty member. While 
faculty members may not actively use social media in the instructional area, 
faculty administrators see social networks as a way to create a community 
of friends that share a common interest. At times, administrators attempt to 
encourage faculty to participate in social networks so that community bonds 
are developed between faculty and students. Some researchers have found 
that students who participate in social networking are more likely to return to 
school for their sophomore year (Chapman, 2010). These students were ones 
who made more connections and showed more friends and posts on their 
social media site. The challenge is to move beyond the survey of opinions 
about social networking and to begin work which uses experimental research 
to measure how social media impact student success.
STUDENTS
In the higher education environment, social media can be beneficial to cur-
rent and potential students in numerous ways. Social media can enhance the

Lily Zeng, Holly Hall, and Mary Jackson Pitts
learning experience and lead to academic success through “creating systems 
of information, contacts and support” (Yu, Tian, Vogel, & Kwok, 2010, 
p. 1496). This starts as early as the day an individual looks for college appli-
cation information, and lasts until that person gets ready for the job market.
Social media help with application efforts. Nearly three out of four Ameri-
can teenage Internet users now use social networking sites (Lenhart, Purcell, 
Smith, & Zickuhr, 2010), which explains why many young individuals are 
experienced social media users by the time they apply for college. Social 
media enable these active users to reach beyond the information they receive 
through interpersonal communication and mass media. For example, Zinch
.com allows prospective students to showcase themselves and connect with 
over 800 colleges and graduate schools as the students prepare applications 
and hunt for scholarships. And the Ning application, boasted as the “World’s 
Largest Platform for Creating Social Websites,” allows visitors to create a 
place where recently accepted students can ask questions and make friends.
Universities also take an active role in this process. Many universities or 
academic departments send out invitations to accepted students through so-
cial media. An applicant can befriend students who already attend her dream 
college, join a group, or follow the tweets by the university or a specific 
academic unit of the university to prepare herself for the transition from sec-
ondary to higher education.
Once on a college campus, students are increasingly immersed in online 
social networking, but the use remains to a great extent for “social” rather 
than for “instructional” purposes. A recent survey of college students re-
ported that education-related use of Facebook was the least common use of 
the technology, as compared with other more frequent uses such as keeping 
in touch with friends (Roblyer et al., 2010). However, this is not to say that 
students use social media for nothing other than fun. Research suggested that 
benefits of social media include social learning, such as expansion of net-
working capacity and psychological well-being, as well as improved learning 
outcomes (Yu et al., 2010).
Online social media allow students to develop networking skills. Network-
ing through online social media enables relationships in a typical core-periph-
ery mode (Yu et al., 2010). On the one hand, a student connects at the pe-
ripheral level with a large group of people that person may or may not know 
very well. For example, it is no longer unusual for a college student to have 
1,000 friends on Facebook. On the other hand, a typical student maintains 
close relationships with a core group of friends through regular interactions.
Use of social media is related to students’ mental health. Not only do 
students need channels other than the classroom to express their feelings 
informally and freely, but also those who are not very comfortable with

face-to-face interaction find social media a friendly environment to express 
themselves and interact with others. Effective communication through social 
media facilitates integration with peers and social acceptance, which in turn 
improves self-esteem, all of which are of vital importance to students’ psy-
chological well-being.
Information a student obtains through social media from sources related to 
the institution often leads to better adaptation and a higher degree of commit-
ment to the university. Social media allow universities to meet students in an 
environment that students are already comfortable with and these initiatives 
are very often well embraced by their target users, students. For example, ap-
proximately 1,000 students at the University of Akron follow a parking Twit-
ter account, which provides traffic updates and helps finding open parking 
spaces on campus. Individuals who are immersed in regular interaction with 
peers on social media tend to be more committed to and more satisfied with 
the university life (Yu et al., 2010). As a consequence, they are more likely 
to continue their education at the selected institution, hence contributing to 
the retention rate at the institution.
Social media engagement has substantial impact on academic as well as 
social learning outcomes. Students need channels other than the classroom to 
capture additional information. And social media make it possible to provide 
the information where students already exist. In addition, individuals with 
a higher level of engagement in social media tend to have better affective 
development, perceive a higher level of social acceptance and self-esteem 
(Morrow, 1999; Steinfield, Ellison, & Lampe, 2008), and better adapt to the 
university culture, all of which play prominent roles in improving their learn-
ing outcomes (Roblyer et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010).
Although social media are rarely used for purely academic purposes, some 
students are positive about the potential for education-related use of social 
media (Roblyer et al., 2010). Among the recommended academic activi-
ties are peer mentoring (Sanchez, Bauer, & Paronto, 2006), peer-coaching 
(Parker, Hall, & Kram, 2008), and orientation practices (Yu et al., 2010). In 
addition, students can take advantage of the expanded networking capacity 
through social media to assist in their learning experience.
While it is no longer news that employers screen job applicants’ social 
media profiles, social media are increasingly being used to assist college 
students in their job-hunting effort in a more positive light. A recent en-
deavor is a LinkedIn application called Career Explorer, which is sponsored 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Still at its experimental stage, Career Explorer 
allows college students at 60 colleges, including the University of California 
at Berkeley, New York University, and Michigan State University, to enter 
the name of their school, their major, and the industry in which they want

Lily Zeng, Holly Hall, and Mary Jackson Pitts
to work. LinkedIn then lists relevant job openings based on jobs that similar 
LinkedIn users pursued (Walker, 2010).
A number of challenges exist in college students’ use of social media. The 
first challenge is possible abuse of social media. The attention span of this 
generation of students is decreasing and when they are engaged in some-
thing, they are often multitasking. Faculty are observing students tweeting or 
posting on Facebook on their laptops or cell phones during class. Although 
the human brain can perceive two stimuli at once (Pashler, 2000), research-
ers have concluded that the brain is limited in how much information it can 
process simultaneously (Meyer & Kieras, 1997; Pashler, 2000). Therefore, 
performing more than one task at a time often results in poorer performance 
such as slower content comprehension and delay in reaction. Students who 
use social media sporadically during class time are likely to be paying less at-
tention to what is going on in class, thus leading to potential negative impact 
on learning outcomes.
The second challenge is the diversity in the form of social media. Although 
Facebook is currently the most popular online social network among adults, 
with approximately 73% of adult social media users owning a profile on the 
site, user patterns of different networks vary by age (Lenhart et al., 2010). 
Specifically, users 18–29 years old are much less likely to have a profile on 
the professionally oriented LinkedIn than those who are 30 and older (7% vs. 
19%) (Lenhart et al., 2010). While educators and universities are encouraged 
to meet students where they are, employers do not necessarily follow suit, 
especially in tough economic times. Therefore, it is important for college stu-
dents to understand how to diversify their social media profiles and showcase 
themselves where potential employers exist.
Last but not least, social media users, particularly college student users, 
sometimes fall victim to the blurring line between their professional and pri-
vate life. Research has repeatedly revealed that individuals post content that is 
inappropriate for audiences such as potential employers (Maranto & Barton, 
2010; Miller et al., 2010). There are several reasons why students engage in 
such negative posting behaviors.
First, some students have insufficient knowledge of who might be view-
ing their profiles. Research suggests that students are most comfortable if 
their information is viewed by their peers and least comfortable if viewed by 
potential employers (Miller et al., 2010). However, an incoming freshman 
may lack the understanding that social media are routinely used as employ-
ment screening tools. Even if they have heard about employers checking 
applicants’ social media profiles, they do not necessarily see how it bears 
relevance to their own profiles or their future career. Miller et al. (2010) re-

Cultivating a Community of Learners

port that students who are far from graduation (i.e., freshmen) tend to engage 
more in inappropriate posting behaviors than those approaching graduation.
Second, there is a lack of knowledge regarding what information to share 
and with whom. Some students routinely post personal information that could 
be used against them in case it falls into the wrong hands. A considerable 
proportion of the college social media population does not know how to lock 
their profiles so that only people with their approval can view the informa-
tion. There is barely any formal education opportunity for students to learn 
what information to share and what not to share, and how to secure personal 
information on social media. Since a fundamental function of social media is 
social learning, most students have to either be self-learners or rely on their 
peers for such knowledge.
Finally, knowing “how to” does not mean that one is actually “doing” 
it. Not all students who know how to secure their profiles screen all friend 
requests to ensure that they are befriending only qualified “friends.” Some 
students accept everyone who requests to be friends with them for the sake of 
a long friend list. Miller et al. (2010) found that at least one out of five college 
students do not screen their friend requests. As a consequence, students who 
think their profiles are protected “may, inadvertently, be granting access to 
the wrong people” (p. 380).
ALUMNI
The uses for social media in alumni relations continue to be developed and 
analyzed. According to a recent Council for the Advancement and Support 
of Education poll of alumni and marketing staff in the United States, United 
Kingdom and Asia Pacific, the primary uses of social media between educa-
tional institutions and alumni is to relationship-build with potential donors 
and to maintain connections with alumni (Fearn, 2010). Regardless of the 
increasing utilization of social media in this area, there remains many ques-
tions about its validity and value, due to the lack of data showing measurable 
successes. The anecdotal evidence available suggests the following benefits 
of social media as they relate to alumni relations: assisting alumni with em-
ployment searches and placement, stimulating new avenues of conversation 
and relationship-building between alumni and institutions, contributing to 
the spread of institutional information, and soliciting donations and support 
from alumni.
Although many schools have active career services departments, alumni are 
finding social media like LinkedIn to be useful resources for connecting on a

professional level. For example, Michigan State University utilizes social me-
dia sites like LinkedIn, YouTube, and Twitter to communicate job opportuni-
ties and to provide occupational resources to alumni (Lavrusik, 2009). Kansas 
State University’s Web site expresses the appeal to follow the alumni associa-
tion on Twitter “to receive K-State job opportunity updates, career advice and 
more” (Social Media, 2010). The University of Connecticut presented an online 
webinar for their alumni association members entitled, “Using Social Media to 
Find the Right Career” (Using Social Media to Find the Right Career, 2010). 
Gonzaga University encourages sign-ups to its LinkedIn page to “connect in a 
meaningful way with alumni and other ‘warm’ contacts” of alumni, faculty and 
staff, parents, peers, internship managers and others (Bobko, 2009).
Many schools realize the critical opportunity for these kinds of services 
is when the student is making the shift to becoming an alum. M.I.T. permits 
students to join its LinkedIn alumni group pre-graduation so they can avail 
themselves of the networking opportunities (Lavrusik, 2009). Those services 
reinforce and support the second benefit of social media in the alumni rela-
tions area: relationship-building with the school. Due to the inherent power, 
social media have to build rapport among “friends,” institutions look to the 
networking tools for the relationship-building purposes of supporting and 
facilitating successful alumni reunions and other alumni events and further 
communicating the brand and institutional identity.
At Macalester College, Facebook was triumphantly hailed as a key tool in 
record attendance numbers for recent alumni reunions. The viral nature of the 
social networking site allowed alumni to connect and quickly spread the word 
about the event, generating excitement and enthusiasm (On Campus: Social 
Media Trends, 2009).
Sporting events are also connecting points with alumni and their institu-
tions. Social media have now, in many instances, filled the gap for those 
wanting to see an event but not able to attend because of geography or other 
reasons. Michigan State University arranged for a Ustream feed of live cov-
erage of the basketball team’s return to campus after winning the NCAA 
regional championship (Ustream is a Web site offering a platform for live 
video streaming of events online). They tweeted a link to the feed as well as 
promoted it on Facebook. In the time span of one hour, over 1,000 people 
from dozens of states and a few foreign countries watched and delighted in 
the team’s homecoming (The MSU Alumni Association Rides the Social Me-
dia Wave, 2010). Many alumni enjoy continuing education and revisiting the 
feeling and atmosphere of learning that their college or university provided. 
Recognizing this, Colgate University makes live webcasts with foremost 
writers available to alumni through their “Living Writers” course. There is an 
interactive element as alumni may offer questions to the writer through a chat

room (On Campus: Social Media Trends, 2009). Again, tools such as these 
break down any geographical barriers and allow alumni a link to the campus 
regardless of their location.
YouTube is a popular source of information-sharing and relationship-
building in higher education. The University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire, for 
example, developed a YouTube channel which includes a variety of materials 
regarding the school from promotional, image videos to poetry readings and 
student projects (UW–Eau Claire Launches Social Media Profiles, 2009).
Beyond relationship-building and information-sharing, one of the most 
important issues in alumni relations today, especially in challenging eco-
nomic times, is increasing donations and cultivating successful fund-raising 
activities. A few institutions have learned how to assimilate the various social 
media tools available into their fund-raising efforts, but many schools are 
uninformed regarding the possible uses of social media in this particular area.
One success story is from Emory University, which began the process of 
cultivating alumni donations with the undergraduate population. The “Blue 
Pig Campaign” used a Facebook profile, Twitter account, and other media to 
persuade students to donate to the school, resulting in a 157% increase in gifts 
from undergraduates, in the hopes that when the students become alumni, 
those giving practices will continue (Lavrusik, 2009).
Macalester College’s president learned firsthand of the power social media 
have in the area of donations and fund-raising. A self-admitted social media 
Luddite (a person who is opposed to technological change), he consented to 
participate in a YouTube video aimed at alumni entitled, “President’s Day at 
Macalester College.” The response was overwhelming for President Brian 
Rosenberg. The college received an unquestionable bump in visibility and 
image. While he thought the video would be simply entertaining and engag-
ing, he did not anticipate the extraordinarily high rate of gifts to the annual 
fund as a result of the video. Another side benefit was the effect on faculty 
and staff. Morale and pride increased as a result of the presidential self-
parody (Rosenberg, 2010).
Despite the numerous accounts of achievement and accomplishment from 
schools with their social media efforts, social media cannot replace the 
value of face-to-face relationship-building activities. In the end, it is a tool 
to facilitate a holistic alumni relations program: to support customary events 
and services. But, there is no doubt that it can be a useful link and continual 
connection with an institution, an emotional, nostalgic bond in which social 
media can be employed as a reminder, stimulant, and prod.
Many challenges remain to be met. In the alumni area, there is simply not 
enough data to show if many of the efforts being expended are really work-
ing. How are we to measure success? Some populations are not heavy users

of social media. If schools funnel too much energy into social media while 
ignoring other communication efforts, it could mean missing communica-
tion opportunities with important constituents. Some schools that are rather 
risk-averse have not invested much or have invested very little into social 
media efforts. They are similarly losing opportunities to connect, mostly 
due to the fear that social media represents a lack of control. Handing over 
that control to social media community participants, these institutions feel, 
could possibly damage the institutional image. Some alumni are not com-
fortable with social media tools and need training. Additionally, there are 
literally thousands of social media tools available. How does an institution 
know which ones to use?
Some potential answers may be found in McGill University’s response to 
the growth of social media in alumni relations programs:
Alumni Relations at McGill University used social media in many areas of our 
programming, but without strategy or metrics or a clear understanding of what 
could be done. . . . We were left floundering, not understanding the depth and 
breadth or the significance of the tools available to us. We decided to tackle the 
situation through education, review, research and most importantly, through the 
hiring of an external online marketing company to advise and guide us through 
the process.
With the help of bv02, McGill Alumni Relations recently launched www
.alumnilive365.mcgill.ca a dynamic social media infrastructure—an aggre-
gate—that allows for effective and measurable engagement of alumni. Alum-
nilive 365 uses RSS feeds to compile McGill related content . . . and allows 
for sharing across various social media . . . The Google Analytics account 
helps us keep track of our social media progress by measuring site statistics. 
(LeCouvie, 2009, p. 24)
Using discrete tools without a real plan or not engaging in social media at all 
can be detrimental to alumni relations programs. The key is to have a well-
researched plan with defined goals, objectives, and measurement strategies 
for evaluation.
The opportunities for collaboration are limitless, especially in easing the 
transition from student to alum. A prime example of this can be found at 
Stanford University. The Stanford Alumni Association offered to graduating 
students a download of an application known as Loop Star, a social mapping 
tool and mobile rewards game, offering a special “Class of 2010” graduation 
gift when students “checked in.” The purpose was two-fold: “to help gradu-
ating students get the most of their Commencement experience, and to help 
them keep in touch with one another as alumni” (Stanford Mixes in Mobile 
Social Media for Commencement Weekend, 2010). They also made their 
Commencement available via live webcast, offered live updates on Twitter,

and allowed Facebook users to post questions to the Commencement speaker. 
Following the event, audio and video recordings of the proceedings were 
made available on iTunesU and YouTube. Efforts such as those sow the seeds 
of alumni engagement for years to come.
CONCLUSION
The primary mission of an educational institution is to prepare students for 
long-lasting and fulfilling opportunities. Faculty and alumni play a significant 
role in creating an environment that cultivates student success. The social 
media platforms provide the setting where faculty and alumni can engage 
with students in ways that invigorate the learning experience. Social media 
can be used as a community-building resource and can enhance face-to-face 
interaction in the educational environment by promoting a holistic, pedagogi-
cal approach which facilitates a sense of well-being.
Institutions of higher education must provide a supportive infrastructure 
in which social networking activities can take place to enhance cultivation 
of the community of learners. Universities should recognize the importance 
of a defined strategic plan for implementation and utilization of social media 
among faculty, students, and alumni. The plan must have clearly stated objec-
tives and formal evaluation methods to assess uses and effectiveness.
There is the question of whether institutions should have social media poli-
cies. These policies can be helpful in delineating appropriate and inappropri-
ate uses of platforms. Legal risks from inappropriate social media postings 
can include claims of defamation, cyberbullying, copyright infringement, 
and false advertising, to name a few. The ultimate aim of any policy in this 
area should be to clearly state what kind of content is acceptable while still 
capitalizing on the real value of social media. To create a policy with broad, 
strict rules could potentially chill free speech, and therefore, affect the quality 
of the dialogue. There should be enough guidance to help users grasp what 
are acceptable and unacceptable uses; tempered with a spirit of independence 
and autonomy to promote authenticity and transparency.
The right of student freedom of speech in particular is based on the landmark 
Tinker v. Des Moines case which stands for the proposition that school officials 
are only allowed to prohibit student speech if it “materially and substantially 
interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline” (393 U.S. 509). 
Nevertheless, courts are still struggling to deal with the issue of “off-campus” 
communications via social media and their impact on the classroom. Finding 
the balance between interference with the learning environment on the one 
hand and First Amendment rights on the other is proving to be a difficult task

for our courts. Currently the vast majority of social media applications handle 
information as if all audiences are homogenous. However, profile owners may 
have preferences over what information they want to share with certain audi-
ence groups. For example, most students are comfortable sharing information 
with peers, but many are cautious when making information available for other 
audiences such as parents and professors. Some even create separate profiles 
for their parents because their parents request to befriend them and they find no 
reason to decline. Such use of social media points out a need for emerging tech-
nology to provide tailored content for each niche audience, possibly through 
channels using the same social media application.
A successful program will create a continuous loop where relationship-
building between students and faculty becomes the first point of connection. 
The social media platforms allow for ease in sustaining the connection the 
student, now alum, has developed with their alma mater. It also creates a 
level of knowledge support and networking potential that invites participation 
of all members of the community. Thus the sustainability of the community 
reaches outside the brick and mortar of the institution into the threads of so-
cial networks no longer confined by geographical space.

Attitudes and Perceptions about 
Social Media Among College Students 
and Professionals Involved and Not 
Involved in Strategic Communications
Bobbi Kay Lewis and Cynthia Nichols
It is impossible to ignore the influence of social media on our society. While 
it took traditional media—such as radio and television—more than a decade 
to reach 50 million users, it took Facebook less than nine months to reach 
100 million users (Patel, 2010). Mobile technologies including laptops, tab-
lets and smart phones allow us to be constantly connected, which has had a 
dramatic impact on our daily lives. Social media are used for personal use 
to connect with old and new friends, build on existing relationships, and 
gather information and community knowledge. John Q. Public is no longer 
the passive consumer of media messages; he can now be creator, publisher, 
producer, and broadcaster. Internet tools such as blogs, YouTube, Flickr, 
and Facebook allow the average person to create content that can be shared 
with a worldwide audience. In addition to personal interaction and enter-
tainment value, social media have become a powerful tool in the arsenal 
of marketers, entrepreneurs, advertisers, and public relations professionals. 
Social media have changed the way society communicates, learns, and con-
ducts business. The interactive nature of these tools has transformed media 
messages from one-way communication to facilitating a dialogue both 
locally and internationally. Advertising spending on the Internet has out-
paced all other traditional media (Center for Media Research, 2004). This 
chapter sought to examine social media and its impact on college students 
and professionals, particularly with respect to strategic communications. 
Because of the integration of public relations and advertising curriculum 
across the country, known as strategic communications, students majoring 
in public relations and advertising are grouped and measured together, and 
professionals in the area of advertising and public relations are also grouped 
together for this inquiry.

SOCIAL MEDIA AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS
Strategic communications, as defined by Hallahan, Holtzhausen, van Ruler, 
Veri, and Sriramesh (2007), is the “purposeful use of communication by an 
organization to fulfill its mission” (p. 4). In many cases, strategic commu-
nications is aligned with an organization’s overall strategy and includes ad-
vertising, public relations, and marketing as disciplines under its umbrella 
(Hallahan et al., 2007). The emergence of the Internet and social media has 
had a tremendous impact on the theory and practice of advertising, public 
relations, and marketing disciplines (Chung, Kim, Trammell, & Porter, 
2007; Pavlik, 2007; Scoble & Israel, 2006; Scott, 2010; Wright & Hinson, 
2010). Marketing, advertising, and public relations programs were once 
developed well in advance and released on the practitioners’ timetable, but 
social media have created a demand for real-time, two-way communica-
tion programs that engage publics and evolve based on the conversation 
(Scott, 2010). Because of its ability to organically connect people, social 
media have become essential to public relations, advertising, and marketing 
practitioners (also commonly known as strategic communicators) as tools 
for communicating with strategic publics. Social media allow marketers to 
communicate with segmented markets virtually automatically. By learning 
consumers’ interests and lifestyles, as represented in their social networking 
profiles, marketers can deliver messages and information that is customized 
to the individual. The rise in this type of social media advertising marks 
a continued trend to establish more intimate relationships with customers 
(Wright, Khanfar, Harrington, & Kizer, 2010). Many strategic communica-
tors also have embraced social media as an important tool to enhance is-
sues management, environmental monitoring, and two-way communication 
(Wright & Hinson, 2009). The rules for doing so are constantly changing, 
and there is considerable uncertainty on how to employ these tools from a 
strategic perspective. According to Pavlik (2007), public relations practitio-
ners have had to adapt their strategies and tactics as media have evolved. 
Some of these adaptations have been strategic and intentional—designed 
to improve effectiveness and efficiency; however, other changes have been 
unintentional—possibly having negative effects on public relations prac-
tices. It has been established that public relations professionals perceive 
social media positively with respect to strategic communications (Wright & 
Hinson, 2010). However, few studies have examined how business profes-
sionals (i.e., those outside the field of public relations) perceive the same 
types of social media.

SOCIAL MEDIA AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
Teens and young adults were among the first to adopt and utilize social net-
working tools as ways to facilitate dialogue and develop online communities. 
Because social networking site usage is so prevalent among college students, 
there is an assumption by many professionals and organizations that they 
know how to employ them as strategic tools (Loretto, 2009). In fact, many 
organizations are looking to college students to fill their social media deficit, 
and are posting jobs on websites, such as Craigslist.org, that seek out social 
media gurus and social media managers. Despite the assumed expertise in the 
title of the positions, these companies are often seeking interns, yet expecting 
them to be able to incorporate advanced social media strategies into the orga-
nization’s initiatives. This particular business strategy assumes that college 
students would be equipped with their own social media strategies that could 
be applicable to the business’ strategic communications efforts. This logic 
begs the question: Does merely having a Facebook page and Twitter account 
make one an expert in social media? Or, do students need to be immersed 
in learning situations that demonstrate how social media can be used stra-
tegically? Media literacy and media education literature suggests that even 
though media and commercial messages are virtually inescapable in Western 
culture, it is still necessary to educate people about the media, its power and 
influence, and how to effectively craft and disseminate mediated messages.
In previous research on college students’ attitudes and perceptions of 
social media, Lewis (2010) found that major, class standing, or number of 
years in school, using social media as a top news source, and social media 
coursework have a significant impact on college students’ attitudes and per-
ceptions of social media. The purpose of this current study was to expand 
the understanding of the impact of social media, and to examine whether 
people’s opinions about social media can be affected by whether they are in 
college or a business professional and whether they are in a strategic com-
munications field or not. The uses, attitudes, and perceptions of social media 
among these groups were explored through survey data. College students and 
business professionals were surveyed to investigate how certain factors, such 
as education, experience, social media habits, and professional focus, can 
affect understanding of and attitudes toward social media. Through situated 
learning theory and Communities of Practice, this chapter examined how it 
is important for students, educators, curriculum leaders, and business profes-
sionals to have an appreciation of social media and how to employ it strategi-
cally in the construction of knowledge and reality.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Situated Learning and Communities of Practice. Largely based on the educa-
tional philosophy of John Dewey (1938) who maintained the importance of 
the processes of actual experience on learning, contemporary learning theo-
ries lean heavily on constructivist notions based on learning through inquiry, 
experience, social interaction, and reflection (Friere, 1970; Kolb & Fry, 1975; 
Rogers & Freiberg, 1993; Vygotsky, 1962, 1978). Lave and Wegner (1991) 
designate learning as a function of activity, context, and culture in which it 
occurs; learning is “situated.” According to Wenger (1998), a social learning 
theory must integrate four components necessary to characterize social partic-
ipation, including: “(1) Meaning: learning as experience, (2) practice: learn-
ing as doing, (3) community: learning as belonging, and (4) identity: learning 
as becoming” (p. 5). Situated learning discussions often refer to the idea of 
a community of practice. Lave and Wenger coined the term “community of 
practice” while studying apprenticeship as a learning model, as reported by 
Wenger (1999). The term refers to the community that acts as a living cur-
riculum for the apprentice. Through further investigation of the concept, Lave 
and Wenger realized the existence of the practice of a community went far 
beyond the formal apprenticeship system (Wenger, 1999). Communities of 
Practice (CoP) are informal, pervasive, and an integral part of our daily lives. 
Knowledge and skills are obtained by participating in activities that expert 
members of the community would perform. Learners become involved in a 
community of practice, which embodies that certain beliefs and behaviors be 
acquired (Wenger, 1998). For example, to facilitate learning in education, 
teachers act as practitioners and expose students to conceptual tools, which 
they then can employ to wrestle with authentic problems. Enculturation into 
the cognitive community is fostered through modeling from the teacher and 
providing authentic activities in an appropriate environment. As Wenger 
(1998) points out, social learning theory is not purely an academic enterprise. 
Social learning not only informs our academic investigations but also influ-
ences our policies and the technical and organizational systems we design 
and work within.
It is also established in the literature that mediated elements play a sig-
nificant role in the situated learning environment. In fact, most of the current 
work in mobile and digital learning theory applies constructivist principles 
and situated learning assumptions (Jonassen & Land, 2000). The concept of 
constructivist learning and situated learning is that learners interact with the 
physical and social world rather than passively receive knowledge (Yukawa, 
2010). This can also describe the difference between traditional media and 
social media. People are no longer viewers or passive audience members

receiving information; social media provides the opportunity to interact with 
and contribute to the knowledge being created and disseminated. The recent 
development of mobile technologies and better understanding and applica-
tion of Web technologies—particularly cognitive tools—is said to have a 
profound impact on pedagogy, according to Comas-Quinn, Mardomingo, and 
Valentine (2009). Technological development is affecting other areas of soci-
ety as well. Traxler (2007) reports new forms of art, employment, language, 
commerce, deprivation, and crime, as well as learning, are emerging from 
the transformed discourse and knowledge created by mobile, personal, and 
wireless devices. Situated learning involves engaging students in meaning-
ful practices, providing access to resources that enhance their participation, 
opening their horizons so they can put themselves in learning trajectories 
they can identify with, and involving them in actions, discussions, and re-
flections that make a difference to the communities that they value. Sharing, 
collaboration, and interaction with other learners and experts from whom the 
learner can obtain different perspectives on the problem clearly enhance the 
opportunities for learning (Comas-Quinn et al., 2009). Wenger (1998) ex-
plains that theories of social practice “are concerned with everyday activity 
and real-life settings, but with an emphasis on the social systems of shared 
resources by which groups organize and coordinate their activities, mutual 
relationships, and interpretations of the world” (p. 13). Social media are part 
of our society’s everyday activity and emphasize the sharing of resources by 
which like-minded groups organize and coordinate their activities, maintain 
relationships, and interpret the world.
HYPOTHESES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
In order to grasp social media’s impact on the communications practice, it is 
important to understand strategic communications professionals’ (Wright & 
Hinson, 2009) and students’ (Lewis, 2010) attitudes about and perceptions of 
social media. However, it is also important to understand how professionals 
and students who are not in the strategic communications industry perceive 
social media. Therefore, this research sought to understand how and if college 
students (strategic communications majors and non) have the same attitudes 
and perceptions toward social media as business professionals (those who are 
in strategic communications and those who are not).
Social media and its impact on strategic communications is a fairly recent 
phenomenon, so the empirical research on the topic is somewhat limited. Wright 
and Hinson’s (2009) survey instrument, used to measure the impact of social 
media on public relations among practitioners, was modified and employed

with permission of the authors to measure the perceptions of social media in this 
study. Driven by the following hypotheses, research questions and purpose, the 
uses of, attitudes about, and perceptions of social media among college students 
and business professionals were explored by analyzing survey data.
H1: Public relations and advertising majors will perceive social media more 
positively than other college students.
H2: Public relations and advertising professionals will perceive social media 
more positively than other business professionals.
In addition, the following research questions were addressed:
RQ1: How will gender affect college students’ and business professionals’ 
attitudes toward social media?
RQ2: How will age affect attitude toward social media?
RQ3: How does number of years in school affect students’ attitude toward 
social media?
RQ4: How will taking a class on social media affect students’ perceptions of 
social media as strategic communications tools?
RQ5: How will years of experience affect professionals’ attitude toward 
social media?
RQ6: How will using social media as a primary news source affect attitude 
toward social media?
METHOD
In many ways, social media have changed the way individuals and corpora-
tions communicate. Blogs, websites, mobile applications (apps), and a variety 
of developing technologies not only give people the ability to tell a story, but 
also have the potential to educate, inspire, and engage others. The ability to 
do so is unlike anything business professionals have encountered before. The 
following section explains the measures used in the study as well as the data 
collection process.
Procedures
To measure the attitudes of the college students and business professionals 
toward social media, quantitative data (N = 667) were collected through two 
methods. First, students (n = 356) enrolled in communications and general 
studies courses at a large midwestern university were administered a paper

survey. Next, business professionals (n = 246) were administered the survey 
via an online host through snowball sampling. Before beginning the survey, 
participants completed an informed consent form that the University’s insti-
tutional review board approved. Sixty-five unusable surveys were thrown out, 
and the remaining 602 were included in this analysis.
Measurement Scale
Attitudes toward social media were analyzed using a 40-question scale 
designed to examine perception of social media with respect to strategic 
communications (Wright & Hinson, 2009). In this scale, 5-point Likert-type 
statements regarding attitudes toward social media ranged from strongly 
disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). Within the survey instrument, some of the 
questions focused on negative associations to social media. Because of this, 
some of the scores were reverse-coded in order to have all positive answers 
associated with a “5” and all negative answers associated with a “1”—thus, 
the higher the score, the greater the agreement. Some language in the sur-
vey was slightly changed to address the student population; however, the 
meanings of the statements were not affected. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient 
of reliability was used to measure the average inter-correlation of the scale 
(Alpha =.889), which met the requirements of an acceptable measure of .70 or 
higher. To determine the significance of the difference between group means, 
ANOVAS, t-tests, and simple linear regression were used for the Likert-type 
survey questions relating to the impact of social media on college students’ 
and business professionals’ communication, in general and with respect to 
strategic communications. The findings of this research were analyzed ac-
cording to the hypotheses and the research questions addressed.
Participants
Similar to previous research of this nature, a majority (62.8%) of partici-
pants were women (n = 378). However, more than a third of the participants 
(n = 217) were male. Since the research focused on the opinions of college 
students versus business professionals, the age distribution was skewed. One-
third (n = 257) of the participants were between the ages of 18 and 20, 18% 
(n = 107) were between the ages of 21 and 24, 20.3% (n = 137) were between 
the ages of 25 and 35, 10.1% (n = 60) were aged 36 to 49, and 5.7% (n = 34) 
were 50 or older.
Of the college students who participated, 35.7% (n = 124) were classified as 
freshman, 31.4% (n = 105) as sophomores, 13.8% (n = 48) as juniors, 15.6% (n 
= 54) as seniors, and 3.5% (n = 12) were classified as graduate students. Col-

lege students who participated also had a wide variety of majors, including ones 
that did not have any emphasis on social media. Because of the integration of 
public relations and advertising in university curricula across the country, stu-
dents majoring in public relations and advertising were grouped and measured 
together. Nearly a third of students (n = 84) had majors directly dealing with 
strategic communications (e.g., public relations, advertising, etc.), and 71.4% 
(n = 210) did not.
Given that social media are having an impact on professionals in the public 
relations industry, the researchers questioned if social media are having a 
similar impact on business professionals outside the public relations industry. 
Nearly two-thirds (n = 142) of the professionals who participated indicated 
they were in the strategic communications field, whereas 36.3% did not 
(n = 81). Participants indicated that they held a variety of jobs outside 
strategic communications, and included everything from finance (6.1%) to 
medical services (3.9%) to education (23.8%). Of the business professionals 
who participated, 13.2% (n = 32) had less than three years experience, 25.6% 
(n = 62) had 3–6 years of experience, 20.2% (n = 49) had 7–10 years of ex-
perience, 14.9% (n = 36) had 11–15 years of experience, and 26.0% (n = 63) 
had more than 15 years of experience.
RESULTS
First, the authors tested the two stated hypotheses. The first hypothesis ex-
pected public relations and advertising majors to perceive social media more 
positively than other college students. This expectation arose from Wright 
and Hinson’s (2010) five-year study among public relations professionals 
and the Lewis (2010) study among college students. The one-way ANOVA 
resulted in significant findings supporting the first hypothesis. Strategic com-
munications majors’ (n = 84) opinions on social media significantly differed 
from students of other majors (n = 210), F (1, 292) = 7.437, p < .042. Students 
who were classified as strategic communications majors (M = 155.16, SD = 
17.42) rated social media more positively than other students (M = 150.88, 
SD = 15.77). In the same vein, the second hypothesis predicted that business 
professionals in the public relations industry (n = 142) would rate social 
media more positively (M = 157.87, SD = 14.78) than other professionals 
(n = 177, M = 155.61, SD = 12.99). However, there were not any significant 
differences between the groups, F (1, 257) = .889, p > .347. Although pro-
fessionals had scores that were similar to those of strategic communications 
majors, there were no significant differences between students and business 
professionals, F (1, 600) = 1.663, p > .198.

The authors then explored the influence of gender on opinions and attitudes 
toward social media. Overall findings indicated that females’ (n = 378) opin-
ions (M = 154.27, SD = 14.96) were significantly different from males’ (n = 
217) opinions on social media (M = 150.36, SD = 15.35), F (1, 593) = 9.104, 
p < .003. To further explore this, a 2 × 2 factorial ANOVA was calculated 
to examine the impact gender and major had on college students’ attitudes. 
Results indicated that gender and major had significant impact on college stu-
dents’ attitudes toward social media, F (1, 286) = 7.223, p < .008, with female 
strategic communications majors (M = 158.16, SD = 2.03) having the most fa-
vorable opinion about social media, followed by male non-majors (M = 151.05, 
SD = 1.68), female non-majors (M = 150.63, SD = 1.49), and male majors 
(M = 145.74, SD = 3.69). Additionally, a one-way ANCOVA was calculated 
to examine the impact gender and industry had on business professionals’ at-
titudes toward social media. Results indicated that gender and job focus did not 
interact to have a significant impact on business professionals attitudes toward 
social media, F (1, 253) = .000, p > .992. Thus, answering RQ1.
Then, to explore the relationship between participants’ attitudes toward 
social media and age, we reviewed a simple linear regression that indicated 
age was not a significant predictor of attitude toward social media, F (1, 593) 
= .006, p > .938 with an R² of less than .001. However, a one-way ANOVA 
comparing the mean scores of attitudes between the six age groups indicated 
significant differences were found among the groups, F (5, 589) = 3.496, 
p < .004. Tukey’s HSD was used to determine the nature of these differences, 
and revealed that participants aged 21–24 (M = 156.59, SD = 16.21) rated 
social media more positively than ages 18–20 (M = 151.12, SD = 15.49) and 
ages 50 and over (M = 147.18, SD = 13.17). However, there were no other 
significant relationships between ages 25–30 (M = 153.36, SD = 14.30), 
31–35 (M = 156.95, SD = 10.98), or 36–49 (M = 152.88, SD = 16.11). Thus, 
answering RQ2.
Next, to explore the relationship between students’ attitudes toward social 
media and years in school (RQ3), we reviewed a simple linear regression that 
indicated years in school was not a significant predictor of attitude toward 
social media, F (1, 345) = 1.413, p > .235 with an R² of .004. Additionally, a 
one-way ANOVA comparing the mean scores of attitudes between the school 
classifications (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, grad student) indi-
cated significant differences were not found among the groups, F (4, 342) = 
1.491, p > .204.
Since many universities are incorporating courses about social media into 
the curriculum, the fourth research question (RQ4) examined the effect tak-
ing such a course had on students’ attitudes toward social media. A one-way 
ANOVA examining the impact that a course in social media might have

on students’ attitudes indicated significant differences existing between the 
groups, F (2, 344) = 6.994, p < .001. Tukey’s HSD was used to determine the 
nature of these differences, and revealed that students who had taken a course 
rated social media more positively (M = 157.13, SD = 16.68, n = 105) than 
those who had not taken a course in social media (M = 150.38, SD = 15.42, 
n = 231). Students who were not sure if they had taken a course in social 
media (M = 148.55, SD = 11.49, n = 11) were not significantly different from 
either of the other two groups.
Next, the authors explored the relationship between business profession-
als’ attitudes toward social media and years of experience. A simple linear 
regression indicated that years of experience explains a practically significant 
amount, approximately 3.0%, of attitude toward social media, F (1, 240) = 
7.323, p < .007. Years of experience and attitude toward social media were 
weakly, positively correlated (r = 0.172). Additionally, a one-way ANOVA 
comparing the mean scores of attitudes between the five experience groups 
indicated significant differences were found among the groups, F (4, 237) = 
3.053, p < .018. Tukey’s HSD was used to determine the nature of these differ-
ences, and revealed that business professionals with 7–10 years of experience 
(M = 157.89, SD = 13.76) rated social media more positively than professionals 
with more than 15 years experience (M = 149.47, SD = 15.49). However, there 
were no other significant relationships between professionals with less than 
3 years experience (M = 155.59, SD = 12.68), 3–6 years (M = 155.34, SD = 
13.05), or 11–15 years (M = 152.03, SD = 13.65). Thus, answering RQ5.
The final research question (RQ6) examined how using social media as a 
primary news source can influence participants’ attitude toward social me-
dia. A one-way ANOVA examining the impact of this indicated significant 
differences existing between the groups, F (1, 591) = 44.631, p < .001. Par-
ticipants that used social media as a primary source of information (n = 327) 
rated social media more positively (M = 156.66, SD = 14.77) than those who 
did not (n = 266) use social media as a primary source of information (M = 
148.46, SD = 14.99).
To further explore this, a 2 x 2 factorial ANOVA was calculated to exam-
ine the interaction that being a student or professional and using social media 
as a primary news source had on participants’ attitudes on social media. 
Results did not indicate a significant impact on participants’ attitudes toward 
social media, F (1, 589) = .173, p < .678. Thus, it appears that no significant 
differences existed between professionals using social media as a primary 
source (M = 155.74, SD = 1.06), students using social media as a primary 
source (M = 152.81, SD = 1.21), professionals not using social media as a 
primary source of information (M = 149.23, SD = 1.44), and students not us-
ing social media as a primary source of information (M = 147.95, SD = 1.18).

Attitudes and Perceptions about Social Media 
139
CONCLUSION
The aim of this chapter was to examine whether college students’ and busi-
ness professionals’ attitudes and perceptions of social media were affected 
by being in the field of strategic communications. The findings in this study 
suggest that strategic communications curriculum does have an impact on 
college students’ attitudes and perceptions of social media. As the data indi-
cated, students majoring in strategic communications had significantly more 
positive attitudes toward social media than other majors. However, there was 
no significant difference in attitudes and perceptions of social media between 
professionals in strategic communications and business professionals in gen-
eral. Professionals’ attitudes toward social media were not impacted by the 
discipline as much as college students’ attitudes.
According to the results, gender had an impact on attitudes toward social 
media. In general, women rated social media more positively. This finding 
held true among college students, but not among professionals. Numer-
ous studies have identified measurable differences in how men and women 
perceive and use new technology; however, Gerlich, Browning, and Wes-
termann (2010) found no significant differences between male and female 
college students in their Internet usage, social media usage, or beliefs about 
social media sites in general. One interesting finding was the significant cor-
relation between gender and major on students’ perceptions toward social 
media. Female strategic communications majors rated social media more 
positively than female non-majors and males despite major. It is important 
to note that males majoring in strategic communications rated social media 
the most negatively of all four gender/major groups. Significant differences 
were revealed in age among participants who are traditional college-age. 
Participants between the ages of 21–24 rated social media more positively 
than participants between the ages of 18–20. This finding also suggests that 
education is having an impact on attitude toward social media. Older college 
students have been exposed to more curricula on social media than younger 
students. However, class standing did not reveal significant differences.
Another interesting finding was that years of experience had relatively 
little impact on professionals’ attitude toward social media. However, partici-
pants with 7 to 10 years of experience rated social media significantly higher 
than professionals with 15 years of experience. This finding indicates that 
professionals with less experience in the business world may see more value 
in social media as strategic tools than professionals with more experience. 
Participants in this study who use social media as a primary news source 
rated social media more positively than those who do not. This is supported 
by the communities of practice theory, which maintains engagement “implies

a sustained intensity and relations of mutuality” (Wenger, 1999, p. 184). The 
more engaged with social media that students and professionals become––
particularly from a strategic perspective––the more likely they are to see the 
value in it.
One of the key findings in this study is that discipline has an impact on col-
lege students’ perceptions of social media, but there was very little evidence 
to support that discipline had an impact among business professionals. The 
differences found between college students and professionals could be a re-
sult of early adoption and heavy consumption. Because college students are 
early adopters of social media and spend more time with social media, they 
are more likely to be positively impacted by learning how to use social media 
strategically. In turn, since adult professionals have been slower to adopt social 
media and consume it less, the notion of using social media strategically is not 
significantly more positive among strategic communications professionals than 
business professionals in general. The significant differences found in regard 
to gender among college students contradicts a recent study by Gerlich et al. 
(2010). However, a study of how 13.2 million people were using social media 
found that both genders are using social media in huge numbers, but women far 
outpace the men (Hoffman, 2008). Thus, further research should examine and 
explore the impact of gender on social media use and attitudes.
In his book Communities of Practice, Wenger (1998) maintains that we 
not only know who we are by what is familiar, but also we know who we 
are not by what is unfamiliar. Our identities are produced through the prac-
tices we engage in, but we also define ourselves through practices we do not 
engage in. This notion of identity helps to explain the findings in the current 
study. The mix of participation and non-participation through which we de-
fine our identities is better understood through the concepts of peripherality 
and marginality (Wenger, 1998). With peripherality, nonparticipation is an 
opportunity for learning. For example, newcomers’ participation in the com-
munity of practice may be peripheral, but the expectation of full participation 
is not a goal or an expectation in this stage as a newcomer. In this study, 
participation is defined as actively using social media, and the community 
of practice is strategic communications. Because students’ participation and 
non-participation is peripheral, they are more open to the opportunity for 
learning. On the other hand with marginality, long-standing members of the 
community of practice can be kept in a marginal position, which does not 
allow for growth in the future. Professionals who have been established in 
strategic communications practice prior to the inception of social media are 
often pushed back into identities of non-participation or viewed as laggards in 
their abilities and use of new technologies. Because of the marginality, there 
is little opportunity for learning.

These findings suggest by providing situated learning environments that 
engage students in meaningful strategic communications practices, students 
will likely be excited to see how they can use social media tools—that they 
adopted for personal use and entertainment—in their careers. For example, 
utilizing a blog/social network platform for teaching enables collaborative 
learning in a real world environment while improving student’s writing 
and communication skills. Social media are having a tremendous impact on 
strategic communications practice, thus business leaders in strategic com-
munications need to determine the appropriate methods to generate enthusi-
asm, maximize learning, and drive performance by leveraging the power of 
social media tools. Professionals, who do not wish to be marginalized in their 
participation in the strategic communications community of practice, must 
break through the barrier and learning curve to actively use social media both 
personally and strategically. Social media cannot be avoided; they are tools 
to be leveraged in education and in practice.
As with any research, this study has several limitations. The first and per-
haps most serious limitation concerns experimental design. As previously 
mentioned, the authors conducted surveys to business professionals online. 
Thus, the researchers have no way of knowing whether each subject was 
focused solely on the survey or influenced by external environs. Addition-
ally, the business professional data was collected through snowball sampling 
primarily through email and social media channels. Thus, the business pro-
fessionals who participated in the survey were likely already familiar with 
social media. What is not known is how business professionals who do not 
use social media on a regular basis feel about it. Additionally, the study is 
limited in that it was conducted on only one college campus in paper format. 
This change in survey form has the potential to skew survey data, as it is a 
different format from how business professionals viewed it. Future studies 
should seek to include students from a variety of universities and regions of 
the country, as well as seeking professional participants through means other 
than social media.

Beyond the Press Release: 
Social Media as a Tool 
for Consumer Engagement
Mia C. Long
A September 2010, Advertising Age, article announced the death of the 
press release (Dumenco, 2010). Though Dumenco focused most of his 
reasoning on the new wave of entertainment news drawing heavily from 
the Facebook and Twitter pages of popular celebrities, it is evident that 
corporations now rely on social networking sites to inform consumers of 
their latest happenings. Moving beyond the press release, many companies 
have sought to not only inform consumers, but also engage them by involv-
ing them in company decisions, drawing them into physical locations with 
Internet-based promotions, and creating a sense of exclusivity for consum-
ers who partake in social media.
In the last few years, companies worldwide seemed to be perplexed by the 
consumer drive to such social media as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. 
Though some still struggle to gain “fans” and “followers,” there are a num-
ber of companies who have gotten it right. Among the top ten companies on 
social networking site (SNS) Facebook are Red Bull, Oreos, and Coca-Cola 
(Porterfield, 2010). Coca-Cola’s success may actually be a result of lessons 
learned from its past failures in customer relations. When, in the mid-2000s, 
YouTube videos sprang up featuring experiments with Diet Coke and Mentos 
candy, the company was not pleased with the video creators (Klaassen, 2009). 
Less than three years later, in August 2008, two avid Coca-Cola consumers 
added to the soft drink company’s list of credentials a fan page on one of the 
world’s largest SNSs (Klaassen, 2009). In stark contrast to its treatment of 
the YouTube media users, the company endorsed the work of the two fans, 
eventually entering into a co-administrator agreement with them (“Hoping to 
Find,” 2009). At the end of 2010, Coca-Cola’s Facebook fan page boasted 
more than 20 million “likes.”

Not every company has had the same success with social media marketing. 
Countless advertising industry articles give poor critiques to companies that 
failed to properly engage consumers. For example, when the Bowl Champi-
onship Series (BCS) launched its Facebook and Twitter accounts, countless 
fans sought interaction with the organization. Instead, they got one-way 
communication which seemed to disregard the value of fan opinions and 
interaction (Thomaselli, 2009). H & R Block found it necessary to adapt its 
traditional personal service approach to social media. Realizing that people 
were not willing to post personal information on the site, the company ad-
justed its tactic and pushed Twitter users to visit one of its company websites 
(Wasserman, 2009). According to Media Week, major brands such as Nike, 
Microsoft, and Dell have, at some point, missed the mark with customer en-
gagement through social networking (“Hoping to Find,” 2009).
What is interesting in all this is how company failure is measured. How 
does one measure the return on investment (ROI) from marketing on sites 
like Facebook and Twitter? Starbucks claimed success when coupons 
posted on its Facebook fan page were printed en masse and redeemed at 
cafés across the nation (York, 2010). More often than not, though, the mar-
keting industry has struggled in providing guidance as to how companies 
should address social media audiences as well as how to properly measure 
ROI. Even when users follow prompts to visit the company websites, 
there is no technique for acquiring the direct effects of social media use. 
Still, companies are able to engage consumers who use their products and, 
through an already established network, reach out to those who do not. In 
this way, social media audiences become unpaid workers for companies 
they “friend,” “like,” or “follow.” The company gets free trusted publicity, 
brand awareness, and perhaps increased customer loyalty. If the company’s 
strategy is effective, consumers get to be heard, connect with other brand 
consumers, and learn more about features and issues connected with a par-
ticular brand. The objectives of this chapter are: (a) to provide an overview 
of the consumer and business uses of Facebook and Twitter; (b) to discuss 
the challenge these two sites present to companies’ consumer engagement 
practices; and (c) to assess how three companies—Whole Foods, Southwest 
Airlines, and BP—have approached that challenge.
THE BUSINESS OF FACEBOOK
Because Facebook relies on members adding friends who add other friends, 
creating a network of trusted allies for each member, there is great potential 
for marketers to reach groups of consumers with similar interests. When

Facebook opened up its pages to businesses, targeted ads began to appear on 
member pages based on interests listed in their profiles. The site soon real-
ized that there was an even better way to reach the public. Companies would 
be allowed to gain friends and fans by creating a page on the site. Good 
for marketers is the fact that consumers find information featured on social 
media to be more trustworthy than company-sponsored communications like 
traditional ads and sales promotions (Foux, 2006; Mangold & Faulds, 2009). 
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg stated that Facebook was “building a 
massive network of real connections between people through which infor-
mation can flow more efficiently than it ever has in the past” (Cohen, 2008, 
p. 11). Zuckerberg added that the SNS had “massive potential for advertis-
ers eager to leverage their brands with minimal effort to a captive audience 
keen to share information about books, music, and products through social 
networks” (p. 11). As such, Facebook members become unpaid, voluntary, 
product promoters.
Each time a Facebook member joins a company’s fan page or “likes” a 
product or company, his friends are alerted of this new association. This, 
in turn, may draw other members to the company’s page. As members post 
their opinions and criticisms of particular brands and products, they engage 
in dialogue with other Facebook members and the company itself. Success-
ful companies will learn from the mistake of the BCS and provide an envi-
ronment for open, honest conversation between all parties. In addition, the 
companies can use their fan pages to inform consumers about promotions 
and drive them to their website or store. Burger King offered free burgers 
to customers who removed 10 Facebook friends from their account (York, 
2009). The practice became so popular the company had to discontinue 
the promotion as it went against the tenets of the site. Similarly, Starbucks 
saw an increase in sales when it offered free pastries to Facebook fans who 
printed off the voucher (York, 2010). Starbucks, one of the 15 most popu-
lar corporate pages, boasted that it is able to maintain such a large number 
of fans because of the unique consumer community created by its brand’s 
products, employees, and environment.
THE BUSINESS OF TWITTER
While Facebook offers companies the opportunity to post photo albums, 
videos, and other content on their fan pages, Twitter does not focus as heav-
ily on page development as it does on the use and frequency of microblogs 
(Kwak, Lee, Park, & Moon, 2010). Developed in 2006, the microblogging 
site boasted over 41 million users, mainly located in the United States and

Mia C. Long
Europe, at the end of 2010 (Kwak et al., 2010; Xifra & Grau, 2010). Twit-
ter users, or “tweeters,” follow others who may blog messages limited to 
140 characters. Unlike Facebook, reciprocation is not a necessity on Twit-
ter. When a Twitter user chooses to “follow” an individual or company, the 
individual or company does not involuntarily become a follower of the user. 
Instead, the individual or company must also make a conscious decision to 
follow that user. Also, in contrast with Facebook is the obligation for a Twit-
ter user to approve their followers. Unless a Twitter user has privatized, or 
locked, their profile, anyone who wishes to follow the user may do so with 
the click of a button. This is quite beneficial for companies who may observe 
what users are saying about their company. As an added bonus, frequent top-
ics on Twitter, referred to as “trending topics,” appear on the right side of the 
screen for all users to see. In this way, a company can be aware of height-
ened discussion surrounding their company or brand. A plethora of Apple 
products were among the most tweeted technology topics in 2010, with the 
Apple iPad, Apple iOS, Apple iPhone, and MacBook Air among the top 10 
(Gaudin, 2010).
Twitter also allows companies to engage in dialogue with multiple share-
holders (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010). Cortés (2009) asserted that public rela-
tions strategies are primarily used on sites like Twitter to build and maintain 
a company’s positive image through the distribution of “company news and 
activities” (p. 92; Xifra & Grau, 2010). All too often, though, companies 
spend time on Twitter responding to customer questions and complaints. In 
2009, companies like Comcast, JetBlue, and UPS used Twitter to resolve 
customer issues (Grant, 2009). Hotel chains have used the site to monitor 
what customers think of them, finding Twitter an effective way to address 
customer concerns. Some companies now have employees devoted to search-
ing social media for customer praise and complaints (Beaubien, 2010). In-
stead of engaging in ongoing dialogue for all users to see, many companies 
will suggest that those with complaints contact staff via e-mail or telephone. 
Companies may also send direct messages to Twitter users in response to 
customer gripes.
As the traditional press release grows into obscurity, the glimmer of social 
media becomes a bright and shining star. Social media like Facebook and 
Twitter provide very few limits for companies’ customer engagement. Face-
book allows companies a space for information distribution and free market-
ing within the many networks of friends on the site. Facebook also allows 
the company to give users a behind-the-scenes look with space for photos, 
videos, and blogs. Twitter varies in the amount of space directly attributed to 
pictures and videos, but affords companies the option of attaching multimedia 
content to their 140-character blog. Companies using Twitter can also pro-

vide summarized information and provide a link to a traditional press release, 
serving both the modern and conservative shareholder. What every company 
must do is determine how to maximize their impact on social media through 
consumer interaction, promotions, and honest, open dialogue.
THE CHALLENGE TO CORPORATIONS
Mangold & Faulds (2009) referred to social media as “the new hybrid ele-
ment of the promotion mix” (p. 357). In interjecting this new feature into 
the world of advertising, personal selling, public relations, publicity, direct 
marketing, and sales promotion, the researchers suggested nine methods that 
will help companies shape the discussions taking place within social media. 
The researchers urged companies to provide a networking platform; use so-
cial media tools to engage customers; use both traditional and Internet-based 
promotional tools to engage customers; provide information; be outrageous; 
provide exclusivity; design products with talking points and consumers’ de-
sired self-images in mind; support causes that are important to consumers; 
and utilize the power of stories.
Mangold & Faulds’ (2009) nine suggestions for shaping producer-con-
sumer discussions on social media can be used as the measuring device for 
company success on Facebook and Twitter. The researchers’ first piece of 
advice is that companies provide networking platforms. They argued that 
consumers like to interact with like-minded people in value- and interest-
centered communities. Secondly, Mangold & Faulds suggested that com-
panies “use blogs and other social media tools to engage customers” (p. 
361). The results of such opportunities for feedback allow for increased 
customer engagement and a further sense of community. Third, the scholars 
urge companies to use both traditional and Internet-based promotional tools. 
Examples of customer-engaging promotions are contests, online customer 
loyalty programs, online voting, online games, and consumer competitions. 
Mangold and Faulds also recommended that companies provide information 
on the premise that “consumers are more likely to talk about companies and 
products when they feel they know a lot about them” (p. 363).
Mangold and Faulds (2009) advised companies to create a “buzz” among 
consumers by doing things that incorporate and shock the public. Based on 
the assumption that consumers like to feel like parts of an exclusive network, 
the researchers proposed that companies provide special deals to a specific 
group of consumers (in this case, Facebook fans or Twitter followers). An 
additional recommendation was that companies keep consumer self-image 
and consumer engagement in mind when designing new products. Such

consideration may increase customer discussion via social media and word 
of mouth. Mangold and Faulds stressed the importance of supporting causes 
of interest to their consumers. Finally, the scholars urged companies to use 
“the power of stories” (p. 364), suggesting that the more memorable stories 
of the company (or company employees and consumers) are, the more likely 
they are to be repeated—even on social media. Each of these elements, or the 
lack thereof, is present when taking a closer look at the social media tactics 
of three popular companies: Whole Foods Market, Southwest Airlines, and 
British Petroleum (BP).
WHOLE FOODS MARKET: AN EXTENDED COMMUNITY
John Mackey, Renee Lawson Hardy, Craig Weller, and Mark Skiles founded 
Whole Foods Market in 1980. The four owners of two previously established 
grocery stores—Safe Way Natural Foods (Mackey and Hardy) and Clarks-
ville Natural Grocery (Weller and Skiles)—felt it was time for the natural 
foods industry to enter the supermarket segment. The first store opened in 
Austin, Texas, with 19 staff members. Today, the company—still based in 
Austin—boasts more than 270 stores in North America and the United King-
dom and over 50,000 team members. Throughout the years, Whole Foods 
Market has merged with and acquired several companies, including: Well-
spring Grocery, Bread & Circus, Mrs. Gooch’s, Fresh Fields, Bread of Life, 
Nature’s Heartland, Harry’s Farmers Market, and Wild Oats© Markets. The 
company describes itself as “the world’s leader in natural and organic foods” 
(Whole Food Markets, 2009).
Sewell (2002) stated that “the best—and most profitable businesses—don’t 
want all the customers” (p. 69). He further stressed that retailers should not 
attempt to gain everyone as a customer. Lovelock and Wirtz (2006) added 
that retailers must build a foundation for loyalty by selecting only custom-
ers who fit their target and delivering quality service to them. Just as Sewell 
illustrates that shoppers at Walmart and Neiman Marcus are substantially 
different, Whole Foods Market management realizes that their customers fill 
a certain niche. Retail consultant Gene Hoffman agrees that Whole Foods’ of-
ferings are designed to appeal to a certain segment of consumers. He declares 
that typical Whole Foods consumers are “from the suburbs, are nutritionally 
and socially conscious and they seek the better products because that is the 
image they have of themselves” (Mitchell, 2006, p. 8).
In the wheel of loyalty discussed in Services Marketing, Lovelock and 
Wirtz (2006) contended that companies must deliver high levels of satisfac-
tion and develop close bonds with customers. Good employee relationships

with customers set the bar for customer expectations and increase customer 
loyalty. Whole Foods employees are applauded for being very knowledge-
able and concerned about meeting customers’ needs. Retail consultant W. 
Frank Dell maintains that the chain’s employees “are proud of what they are 
selling, while associates in traditional supermarkets just seem to be putting 
in their time” (Mitchell, 2006, p. 10). The company itself affirms that its 
employees are “passionate about healthy food and a healthy planet” (Whole 
Foods Markets, 2009).
Lovelock and Wirtz (2006) further asserted that social bonds that extend 
to shared experiences between customers “can be a major loyalty drive for 
the organization” (p. 375). Whole Foods develops social and customiza-
tion bonds with its customers by appealing to issues that are important to 
them. The company gives at least 5% of its annual net profits to charity 
(Fishman, 2004; Whole Food Markets, 2009). The company website also 
reveals information on requesting donations, choosing beneficiaries for the 
company’s 5 Percent Days/CommUnity Giving Days, and who to contact 
for company sponsorship.
In addition to its entry into social media, Whole Foods educates consum-
ers through its e-mail newsletter. The weekly notices include store specials 
and events, contests like the March 2009 Baby’s Favorite Foods photo con-
test, money saving tips, and unique recipes. The development of customer-
organization ties is deepened by the company’s invitation—on its website 
and in the newsletter—for customers to join Whole Foods on such social 
media as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. The company welcomes customer 
feedback via the company newsletter, website, and blog. In her article on 
the company’s progression, Howell (2005) stated, “Whole Foods’ ability to 
satisfy an extremely loyal and expanding customer base interested in healthy 
and premium-quality food grows each year and is giving fits to conventional 
supermarket chains . . .” (p. 22).
THE WHOLE FOODS SOCIAL COMMUNITY
On Facebook, Whole Foods describes its page as “fresh organic content from 
Whole Foods Market HQ in Austin, TX,” and listed 464,841 fans as of Feb-
ruary 8, 2011. On the page, the company features general information such 
as the year it was founded (1980), company overview, company mission and 
core values, and links to its many websites; videos of Whole Foods products 
and promotions; and links to location-specific Whole Foods grocers. The 
Whole Foods page also offers its fans the opportunity to learn more about its 
charitable organization via a link to the Whole Planet Foundation.

On their Facebook fan page, Whole Foods creates an environment for their 
grocers and other like-minded individuals to interact online. Whole Foods 
takes it a step further by offering links to “sub-networks” of 156 specific 
Whole Foods locations. Whole Foods fans are also greeted throughout the 
day with messages regarding topics that may be of interest to them such as 
recycling, healthy eating, and store openings. Whole Foods fans are regularly 
engaged through trivia games and polls. For example, on April 7, 2010, the 
site invited members to take “pesticides out of the recipe” and partake in an 
online poll.
Aside from the aforementioned polls, the Whole Foods fan page offers a 
variety of tools for customer feedback and engagement. First, Whole Foods 
administrators periodically provide information on their “Wall” and in their 
“Notes” section, to which fans can respond with their own opinions and 
critiques. Fans are also allowed to initiate posts on the grocer’s wall and 
post responses to company-uploaded photos and videos. The page features 
three additional feeds: “Recipes,” where readers can find budget-friendly and 
healthy recipes; “Newsletter,” where fans may follow links to three newslet-
ter offerings featuring information about the company, local Whole Food 
Market stores, and Whole Foods Market recipes; and “Gift Boxes,” where 
fans of the page receive 20% off any online Whole Foods Market gift box 
orders. Links to the company’s website blog, Twitter feed, and Flickr account 
allow for greater interaction between the company and consumers.
The Whole Foods page offers incentives to members for participating in 
company-sponsored polls. For example, the company-initiated post of April 
9, 2010, states, “Let’s raise fish that say no to drugs. Speak up in our poll 
for a chance to win a $100 gift card!” Two weeks prior, Whole Foods fans 
were invited to participate in the Whole Foods Pineapple Contest, entering 
to win a nine-day trip to Costa Rica. As it relates to the traditional press 
release, the Whole Foods Market Facebook page provides a wealth of in-
formation for its fans. The company’s page consists of the following tabs: 
Wall, Info, Recipes, Newsletter, Video, Boxes, Gift Boxes, and Notes. The 
wall is updated every day by fans or the company. On the wall, the company 
posts information on recycling, company products, recipes, films, and warn-
ings of Facebook scams. The “Info” section of the Whole Foods page offers 
such information as the year the company was founded, company-sponsored 
websites, the company overview and mission, and a brief blurb about its 
products. The “Video” segment features 99 videos with titles from “Festive 
& Budget Friendly Holiday Appetizers” to “Especially Delicious Dishes for 
Special Diets” as well as cooking videos and videos on associated entities 
(like the Savannah Bee Company). The “Boxes” segment contains links to 
“The Whole Story,” the Whole Foods Market blog, the company’s newslet-

ter, the Whole Planet Foundation, and photos from the Whole Foods Flickr 
page. The “Notes” segment includes information on company sweepstakes, 
store openings, organic certification, and employment and sampling policies.
Whole Foods’ presence on Twitter is similar to that on Facebook, pro-
ducing consistency across the two sites. On Twitter, Whole Foods Market 
releases information regarding store openings and accolades the company 
receives from other organizations. The company also invites its followers 
to engage in activities related to healthy eating. For example, in December 
2010, the company urged followers to watch a cooking competition featuring 
a chef from one of its stores. The company also partakes in cross promotion, 
urging consumers to purchase items that will instantly provide them with the 
chance to win a gift card to the store. Though most of the responses listed 
on the company’s Twitter page are to positive customer statements, there are 
also some which acknowledge customer concerns. Those concerns include 
suggestions that the company open a new store in a particular town or ques-
tions regarding food items and recipes.
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES: LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT
Southwest Airlines has long been heralded for its superior corporate com-
munication and media relations efforts (Callison & Seltzer, 2010). The 
company’s ability to address the needs of its publics in the traditional sense 
seemed to evolve into social media as well with its recognition as PR News’ 
“Best Blog” in 2007 and 2008 (Callison & Seltzer, 2010). While many of 
these accolades relate to the company’s relationship with and approval by 
journalists and public relations practitioners, the driving force behind the 
company are Southwest Airlines passengers. Social media like Facebook and 
Twitter provide the company with fertile ground for building a relationship 
with this public and present the potential to gain new patrons. What is inter-
esting is that the company seems to address two different audiences on the 
two different social media sites, providing one group with information and 
using them for free promotion, while providing customer service and open 
invitations to the other.
Of the half a billion Facebook users, over one million are fans of Southwest 
Airlines (SWA). Those who have not “liked” the page are quickly prompted 
to do so by the image of an SWA flight attendant. The flight attendant directs 
users simultaneously to the page’s “like” button and to information regarding 
a sweepstakes for those who “like” the page. As a reward for liking the page, 
Facebook users gain the chance to win two round-trip tickets on the airline. 
Contests like these are featured throughout the fan page for those who “like”

it and those who have yet to jump on board. For instance, during the month of 
December 2010, the page featured information on a contest sponsored by the 
Grand Ole Opry that included a Southwest Airlines flight to see Keith Urban 
at the historic venue. The page also allows visitors to register for other prizes 
including free travel.
More than anything, the Southwest Airlines fan page urges visitors to post 
airline information to their own Facebook pages. One section of the page 
allows users to calculate how much money they save annually flying South-
west, which does not charge for passengers’ first or second bags. Visitors are 
then prompted to post their savings on their own page. Various polls placed 
throughout the page also include ways in which users can post results on 
their personal pages. Likewise, the page features a playlist of artists such as 
Dwight Yoakam, Simon and Garfunkel, Bon Jovi, and Tom Petty which fans 
can post on their Facebook pages. In essence, the page is intended for fans 
to have fun, but also for them to share their experiences with their network 
of Facebook friends. In this way, Southwest Airlines fans have a heightened 
potential to voluntarily promote the company, increasing its awareness and 
reach on the site.
The company has no qualm about its use of the Facebook page, disclos-
ing that it is not meant to be a customer service page. Expounding upon 
that fact, the company requests that visitors present customer service issues 
via mail, offering the company address, or telephone, listing the company’s 
phone number. This further illuminates the Southwest Airlines fan page’s 
function as a promotional tool rather than a tool for full customer engage-
ment. Certainly, the site does allow fans to interact with the company. Fans 
may post comments on SWA’s Facebook wall, post pictures or videos, and 
share several elements of the page with their network of friends by post-
ing information on their walls. However, Facebook fans are also neglected 
in certain aspects of traditional public relations. For example, Southwest 
Airlines fans are not informed of upcoming events. As of December 2010, 
the last post to the events page publicized an airline party that took place 
on May 12 of the same year. The previous event post was from an event in 
October 2009.
In terms of providing general information about the company, the South-
west Airlines Facebook fan page features the company’s founding date 
and links to numerous SWA websites from the main company site to the 
company blog to its Twitter account. The fan page also helps fans feel con-
nected and reminds them of their past Southwest experiences with videos of 
Southwest staff and crew members. In a modern version of the traditional 
press release, the page even features a two-minute video about the company 
“going mobile.”

In contrast, the Southwest Airlines Twitter account seems to operate 
primarily as a customer engagement and service tool for followers. The 
company often tweets responses to followers in relation to in-flight services, 
customer complaints, customer suggestions, and praise for great service. In 
addition, the company offers information on the latest company announce-
ments, events, and promotions. For example, in 2010, the company invited 
customers to join them for one day of free Corona on all flights and intro-
duced new apps for Droid and Blackberry. The SWA Twitter account also 
lends itself to more customer engagement in that it requests content like 
photos from its followers.
Overall, Southwest Airlines uses each social media, Facebook and Twitter 
in particular, in a different way. It uses Facebook for free promotion in an at-
tempt to extend its reach among the many networks the site offers. The com-
pany does this through polls, contests, and other offerings, all of which may 
be posted to a fan’s own Facebook page. On Twitter, the company engages 
more with customers, requesting more customer interaction and responding 
to customer questions, suggestions, and requests. Though Southwest Airlines 
refers Facebook fans to the company’s Twitter page, where it frequently 
responds to customer service issues, the company limits its customer service 
focus to the company headquarters and toll-free line on its Facebook page. 
Either site, though, is much less formal than the traditional press release, al-
lowing the company to show off its fun side (Bush, 2009).
BP VS. BP GLOBAL PR: A (TWITTER) LESSON IN RESPONSE
BP’s presence on Twitter gained overwhelming attention during its 2010 Gulf 
oil disaster. Because of its failure to respond to the public in an acceptable 
amount of time, the company was berated on various forms of media. Its 
Twitter presence, in particular, was forever changed with a user’s creation of 
a BPGlobalPR account, not related to the company. In May 2010, the spoof 
account had nearly 20,000 followers while the company’s actual account had 
only 5,000. The company was not the least bit pleased with the fake account, 
but that did not stop its creators from making the most of the BP debacle and 
public relations failure. Among the tweets the fake account posted throughout 
the year were: “If we had a dollar for every complaint about this oil spill, it 
wouldn’t compare to our current fortune. Oil is a lucrative industry!” and 
“Please do NOT take or clean any oil you find on the beach. That is the prop-
erty of British Petroleum and we WILL sue you” (Male, 2010).
Beneath the comic portrayal of the company, the real BP struggled to gain 
ground with consumers on the Twitter site. The company chose to focus on

Mia C. Long
response rather than their reputation throughout the crisis. Perhaps this is the 
reason the company did not ask Twitter to remove the fake account (Parekh & 
Bush, 2010). However, Twitter, in accordance with its impersonation policy, 
later requested that the account holder change the image associated with the 
account as it closely resembled the actual company (Learmonth, 2010b). The 
reason behind the request was that the account violated the Twitter imperson-
ation policy, in which “fake” accounts had to be labeled as such. Ironically, 
BPGlobalPR simply made the image black and white and added a drop of oil 
to one point on the logo.
Though BP chose to focus on recovery in the gulf rather than have an 
all-out war against the “fake” account holder and eventually hired Ogilvy to 
market its rebranding, the company’s failure to respond quickly—via social 
media and otherwise—is remembered as one of the biggest stories of the year. 
Aside from the fact that it took the company three months to stop oil from 
leaking into the Gulf, the company failed to adequately address consumers in 
the social media realm. Many consumers thought the BPGlobalPR account 
was the company account and expressed anger and grief surrounding the 
company on a page the company did not own. The blurring of multiple ac-
counts attributed to one company may present a threat for all companies. For 
this reason, companies must be aware of what is occurring on social network-
ing sites, even if they are not fully engaged on the sites themselves.
CONCLUSION
Debate may abound over whether the press release is dead, but there is no doubt 
that social media is very much alive. Facebook and Twitter, with over half a 
billion and 175 million users, respectively, provide an ideal opportunity for 
corporations to inform and engage consumers. Facebook allows companies to 
establish pages which users may “like” and voluntarily promote to their friends. 
On these pages, companies and brands can provide information and customer 
service, offer interactive promotions and games, and build a loyal community 
of consumers. Twitter also allows for the development of a media-driven 
consumer base for companies. Utilizing 140-character statements that inform 
multiple publics of the latest information, promotions, and events, companies 
on Twitter develop a network of followers who are made more knowledge-
able about their brand. These consumers—insiders in a sense—eagerly await 
company announcements regarding new products, general information related 
to the company’s consumer community, and response to customer suggestions 
and complaints. In addition, these Twitter followers have the ability to retweet 
the company’s message to their own followers.

Extending Mangold and Faulds’ (2009) suggestions for companies using 
social media, Whole Foods Market, Southwest Airlines, and BP provide 
tips on company and consumer interaction on Facebook and Twitter. Whole 
Foods exhibits the importance of catering to an already-established niche 
community that shares common concerns and priorities. For instance, a focal 
point of the Whole Foods Market Facebook and Twitter profiles is the sharing 
of information for a healthy lifestyle. On both sites, the company offers users 
healthy recipes and information on store openings throughout the nation. In 
addition, its Twitter account invites questions from followers, though it limits 
responses to weekday business hours. Still, the overall goal of Whole Foods 
Market is to engage their distinct niche of consumers who desire to live a 
healthy lifestyle and contribute to the development of a well-nourished earth.
Southwest Airlines displays prowess in engaging current and potential 
customers through its social media accounts. Southwest also demonstrates 
independent uses for Facebook and Twitter, though the fun-loving image of 
the airline shines through on both. On Facebook, the company strongly urges 
visitors to “like” its page through the use of promotional giveaways. Further, 
SWA urges users who “like” its page to share the results of company-spon-
sored games, polls, and promotions on their own Facebook pages, increas-
ing its reach. However, the company makes it clear that its Facebook page 
is not intended to provide a platform for customer service. Conversely, the 
company’s Twitter account invites consumers to contribute to its content by 
tweeting, retweeting, and responding to customer stories, suggestions, com-
plaints, and praise. Customers are also invited to meet members of the crew 
or visit Southwest Airlines gates at airports throughout the nation.
Finally, BP provides a useful example of what not to do in a social media 
platform and speaks to the importance of a multimedia version of the tradi-
tional press release coupled with immediate actions for service recovery. In 
a time of crisis, the company failed to respond to customers in a timely man-
ner, despite its presence on a social media site that allowed for immediate 
and ongoing response. What proved worse for the company was its alleged 
misrepresentation through the parody Twitter account, @BPGlobalPR. In its 
efforts to clean up the Gulf, it failed to adequately address consumers, many 
of whom took @BPGlobalPR as the company’s official account. Despite the 
eventual distinction given to the spoof, BP lost ground with its consumer 
base. In this way, the company illustrated the importance of a company’s 
interaction with consumers on social media, especially in a time of crisis.
Though some predict an inevitable demise for Twitter, Facebook continues 
to evolve. It is critical that companies take advantage of both while they do 
exist as they present captive audiences in the millions. Twitter, in particular, 
seems to be a site primarily used by youth, minorities, and practitioners,

providing a prime source in reaching these markets. Merely existing on ei-
ther site, though, is not enough. In fact, a 2010 study found that “only 1% 
of consumer tweets that mention a brand are part of an active conversation 
with that brand, meaning marketers are, for the most part, conducting one-
way conversations—the opposite of the way consumers often use Twitter” 
(Learmonth, 2010a, para. 4). It is up to companies, then, to expound upon 
Mangold and Faulds’ (2009) suggestions for engaging consumers by involv-
ing them in product creation, doing the “outrageous,” and providing rewards 
and exclusivity.

Marketing and Branding in 
Online Social Media Environments: 
Examining Social Media Adoption 
by the Top 100 Global Brands
Miao Guo
As the buzzword “Web 2.0” becomes increasingly merged into the business 
community and common people’s lives, the traditional Internet is under-
taking a major evolution from both technological and social perspectives 
(Klinc, Dolenc & Turk, 2009). Meanwhile, the firms that have jumped on 
the Internet bandwagon, using it as a marketing and branding vehicle, are 
facing a new challenge from the proliferation of online social media. Sev-
eral industrial observations predict that in the few short years that social 
media has been a marketing vehicle, it has already exhibited an enormous 
effect on the way companies do business. There will be even more changes 
in the coming years, because social media marketing continues to extend 
from the marketing department to nearly every aspect of a company’s busi-
ness (eMarketr, 2010).
Recognized as principal components of Web 2.0, social media such as 
online social networks, blogs, podcasts, and Really Simple Syndication 
(RSS) feeds—once the domain of younger, tech-savvy consumers—have 
gradually entered the mainstream covering a broad demographic spectrum 
(Stephen & Galak, 2009). Some industrial surveys found that around 75% 
of U.S. adults used such social media to connect with each other (Bernoff, 
Pflaum, & Bowen, 2008). The number of Americans over 35 on Facebook 
has nearly doubled, and women over 55 remain the fastest growing group 
on Facebook (Abell, 2009). Other findings indicated that Twitter is most 
popular among working adults; in 2009, the largest age group using Twitter 
was between 35–49 years old, comprising almost 42% of the site’s audi-
ences (McGiboney, 2009). Moreover, Nielsen (2009) reported that social 
networking and blogging sites have overtaken personal e-mail as the fourth 
most popular activities on the Internet.

At the same time, consumers’ desire to interact with marketers is high. 
According to a survey conducted among a sample of American social media 
users, 93% of them indicated that a company should have a presence in social 
media and about 85% said that a company should not only have a presence in 
social media but also interact with customers through these platforms (Cone, 
2008). Though most organizations still struggle in understanding how social 
media might be used to its full potential, companies, large and small, have 
actively utilized various social media applications as a marketing tool (Pet-
tice, 2009). For example, around 16% of the primary corporations listed on 
the Fortune 500 have corporate blogs, which also link to a variety of social 
media channels, including podcasts, RSS feeds, and microblogs (Barnes & 
Mattson, 2009).
Particularly, social media have been increasingly recognized as compelling 
tools in marketing and branding for several reasons: As an industry report 
stated, companies can reinvigorate their marketing and create new bonds 
with consumers by looking at social media as a way to listen to consumers, 
respond to their needs, and create ongoing dialogue instead of as another way 
of advertise to them (Williamson, 2009). It is also observed that consumers 
and firms are conducting a substantial amount of business on the Internet; 
meanwhile, the marketers prefer the decentralized, many-to-many Web for 
e-commerce to the centralized, closed-access environments provided by 
online services (Lichtenberg, 2009). Accordingly, social media vehicles like 
social networks, syndicated videos, and blogs are expected to grow the fastest 
and become the third-largest interactive marketing spending category in five 
years (VanBoskirk, 2009).
Despite the prevalence of social media and their importance in market-
ing and branding, fundamental issues such as the attributes of social media 
and their relative effectiveness in marketing and branding remain to be 
explored. Moreover, are there any differences in social media adoption 
by different types of industries? Hence, the purposes of this study were to 
examine how and to what extent corporate websites engage in social media 
to realize marketing and branding functions. Specifically, guided by the 
perspectives of media characteristics in communications and information 
processing fields, the current study first proposed a social media typology 
according to diverse characteristics possessed by a variety of social media. 
Second, it used content analysis to ascertain which social media vehicles 
are evident on corporate websites and whether the difference in social me-
dia adoption varies by industry type. Last but not least, this study explored 
how companies engage in social media to realize marketing and branding 
functions by applying an integrative approach from mass media, Internet 
branding, and relationship marketing.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Social Media Definition and Media Characteristics
Social media often refer to online applications, platforms, or media that aim 
to facilitate interaction, collaboration, and content sharing (Universal Mc-
Cann, 2008). Compared to traditional mass media, social media are consid-
ered the “activities, practices, and behaviors among communities of people 
who gather online to share information, knowledge, and opinions using con-
versational media,” that are “web-based applications that make it possible to 
create and easily transmit content in the form of words, pictures, videos, and 
audios” (Safko & Brake, 2009, p. 6). In a sense, social media in the study’s 
context is defined as conversational media and their online applications to fa-
cilitate information sharing, knowledge distribution, and opinion exchanges.
The most prevalent social media in practice include social networks (e.g., 
Facebook and MySpace), blogs, microblogs (e.g., Twitter), online message 
boards/forums, social bookmarks (e.g., Digg and Delicious), and content 
sharing communities (e.g., YouTube and Flickr). These social media gen-
erally possess the following prominent attributes: participation, openness, 
conversation, community, and connectedness (Immediate Future, 2008; May-
field, 2008). Specifically, the most profound characteristic of social media 
that differs from traditional mass media is their dynamic and flexible partici-
patory nature. This not only allows individuals to receive information, but 
also empowers them to take part in the creation and distribution of content; 
hence, it blurs the line between media and audiences (Interactive Advertising 
Bureau [IAB], 2009). Meanwhile, different from the one-way broadcasting 
nature of mainstream media, social media is better seen as a two-way con-
versation (Mayfield, 2008). More important, social media encourages the 
building of communities, allowing groups of people with common interests 
to interact with one another, and enables communication to form quickly and 
effectively as well. Most social media also thrive on their connectedness, 
which usually links to other social media, web sites, resources, and people 
(Immediate Future, 2008).
These prominent attributes vary greatly among a host of social media and 
each of them is unique and functions differently, therefore studying basic media 
characteristics may provide a structural context for comparing a variety of so-
cial media channels. Particularly, Hoffman and Novak (1996) proposed several 
dimensions to differentiate media type when examining marketing in hyperme-
dia computer-mediated environments. The first dimension is communication 
mode. This dimension is based on conventional models of communication from 
senders to receivers, which includes one-to-one communication between two 
consumers, one-to-many, few-to-few, and many-to-many modes. The second

Miao Guo
dimension of measuring media characteristics is person-interactivity, signifying 
“whether interactivity between people occurs through a medium or is unmedi-
ated, as in the case of face-to-face communication” (Steuer, 1992, pp. 77–78). 
On the other hand, machine-interactivity is “the extent to which users can par-
ticipate in modifying the form and content of a mediated environment in real 
time” (Steuer, 1992, p. 84).
The remaining four media characteristics are related to media content. One 
dimension identifies whether static or dynamic information such as video, 
audio, image, or text can be delivered by the medium. The number of linked 
sources available specifies “how many sources of content are readily acces-
sible or available to the user at any given usage opportunity,” and media 
feedback symmetry measures “whether different parties in the communica-
tion process employ differing media bandwidth for sending information” 
(Hoffman & Novak, 1996, p. 54). The last dimension, temporal synchron-
icity, characterizes whether interaction occurs concurrently or sequentially 
(Hoffman & Novak, 1996).
Social Information Processing
Social information processing theory provides a useful lens to examine how 
interpersonal influence processes through social media. The basic premise of 
social information processing theory is that meaning is socially constructed, 
and social environments are an important source of information and cues for 
individuals’ perceptions and behavior (Fulk, Steinfield, Schmitz & Power, 
1987). In contrast to traditional face-to-face conventional contexts, the inter-
personal interaction and information processing in social media ecosystems 
presents significant differences in several ways.
First of all, the information delivered on social media has extended from 
natural language to all formats of communicative languages, including text, 
video, audio, and rich media. Daft and Wiginton (1979) posited that all three 
basic media such as video, audio, and computer text provide similar capa-
bilities like using natural language and numbers. Furthermore, the personal 
influence possible through online social media such as social networks is con-
siderably expanded in terms of its scale and scope, as computer mediation al-
lows “a much larger number of individuals to be connected by informational 
linkages than feasible through face-to-face contact or through conventional 
media such as the telephone” (Subramani & Rajagopalan, 2003, p. 301).
More important, by engaging in online social media, people do not have 
to extend as great of an effort to reach a large number of people, which en-
courages individuals to act on their natural impulse to share knowledge and 
communicate information they consider useful and timely in their social net-

works. Furthermore, the immediacy of feedback through computer-mediated 
communication media such as social networks provides the unprecedented 
ability to connect individuals concurrently or sequentially (Dennis & Kinney, 
1998; Subramani & Rajagopalan, 2003). Concurrent feedback is feedback 
provided simultaneously with the delivery of the message, while sequential 
feedback occurs when the sender pauses (or the receiver interrupts) and the 
receiver communicates to confirm understanding or to redirect the sender’s 
presentation of the message (Dennis & Kinney, 1998). Thus, the rich informa-
tion delivered by online social media, the ability to influence a large number 
of individuals, the minimal effort required to make influence attempts, and 
the flexibility to deploy a variety of influence strategies through information 
technologies are a potent integration, allowing that the influences of social 
media to be more compelling and pervasive than conventional mass media.
Online Relationship Marketing
Relationship marketing is defined as an approach to establish, maintain, and 
enhance long-term associations with customers and other stakeholders (Koi-
ranen, 1995). Evans and Laskin (1994) proposed that relationship market-
ing is a customer-centered approach, enabling companies to seek long-term 
business relationships with prospective and existing customers. Rapp and 
Collins (1990) pointed out that the goals of relationship marketing are to cre-
ate and maintain lasting relations between the firm and its customers that are 
rewarding for both sides. It is obvious that the central theme of relationship 
marketing is to communicate and to get involved with customers, thereby 
developing an ongoing relationship with products or services. In this regard, 
companies perceive their customers as the sum of their potential lifetime 
value rather than a collection of individual sales opportunities (Gan, Sim, 
Tan & Tan, 2006).
Prior studies have recognized the advantages of relationship marketing 
through the Internet and proposed several online relationship marketing mod-
els based on the presence of various business sector websites. By analyzing 
Singapore hotel websites, Gan et al. (2006) proposed a four-level online rela-
tionship marketing model and suggested that a range of Internet tools can re-
alize the four relationship marketing functions on the hotel websites. The four 
levels are the use of information to create market awareness among custom-
ers, the collection of data and identification of customer preferences, website 
personalization, and the creation of community and long-term relationships. 
Meanwhile, focusing on Irish companies’ online relationship marketing, Gei-
ger and Martin (1999) found that companies use websites for three market-
ing purposes such as ornament, information, and relationship, therefore they

Miao Guo
observed three strategies when the companies use the Internet as a medium 
within the marketing and communications arena, including ornamental web 
presence, informational web presence, and relational web presence.
As a part of online relationship marketing, the goal of marketing with 
social media is to build a relationship and conversation with customers. Par-
ticularly, marketing within social media is not simply sending messages; it is 
an engagement with online communities to share and exchange perceptions 
and ideas, generate exposure, opportunities, and sales (Drury, 2007). Enabled 
by their strengths in building personal connections and relevance, social 
media have been recognized as optimal niche marketing tools as they can 
effectively reach targeted audiences. Most important, compared to traditional 
mass media, marketing with social media has a more sizable effect on market-
ing performance due to their larger volumes than traditional media (Stephen 
& Galak, 2009). It is obvious that the use of social media as relationship 
marketing tools allows companies to build lasting relationships with potential 
and existing customers. However, what has not been explored is which social 
media channels are most evident and effective in building trusting relation-
ships by different industries.
Internet Branding
Branding refers to the process of creating value through the use of a compel-
ling and consistent offer and customer experience that will satisfy customers 
and keep them coming back (Aaker, 1991). Previous studies pointed out that 
the advance of new technologies in the Web and emerging marketing trends 
have significantly shifted the balance of power from brands to customers, 
therefore companies have to adjust their branding and marketing strategies 
to match the unique attributes and capacity brought by the Internet and its 
applications (Simmons, 2007). For example, Court, McLaughlin, and Halsall 
(2006) suggested that companies should not only generate awareness on 
their websites, but they need to focus on developing trust and relationships 
through an improved “click-to-order” ratio and repurchase rates. Moreover, 
Ibeh, Luo, and Dinnie (2005) indicated that through targeting customers with 
unique messages, unique functionality, content, and personalization tech-
niques can build stronger relationships between customers and brands.
Internet branding strategies and brand utility relying on the Internet’s 
unique technological characteristics are found to substitute, complement, or 
improve offline brand functions (Chen, 2001; Ibeh et al., 2005; Simmons, 
2007). Specifically, Chen (2001) suggested that recommender systems and 
online communities can offer similar brand functions such as providing assur-
ance of quality and indicating status or prestige. Domain names, hyperlinks,

and “favorites lists” in the websites also complement such offline brand func-
tions as new product familiarity, product differentiation, and promotion. Fur-
thermore, Simmons (2007) proposed that diverse web-based tools and a host 
of social media can be utilized to perform different online branding functions. 
For example, blogs, RSS feeds, and online communities are the best tools to 
establish interaction and relationships with consumers.
Although branding with social media is in its initial stage, academic schol-
ars and industry practitioners have showed stronger interests in this field. One 
report surveyed how the top 100 global brands engaged in various social me-
dia channels, including blogs, branded social network/community, discussion 
forums, and content sharing websites (e.g., Flickr and YouTube), Wikis, and 
Twitter (Wetpaint & Altimeter, 2009). The findings demonstrated that social 
media involvement varies by industry, and media and technology companies 
tend to be most aggressive in social media adoption. Moreover, as the number 
of social media channels increase, overall engagement increases at a faster 
rate (Wetpaint & Altimeter, 2009). On the other hand, taking each social 
media channel as a unit of analysis, one industry survey reviewed the num-
ber of times a brand was mentioned on various social media platforms and 
determined brands’ share of voice of social media. The results showed that 
electronics companies and the automotive industry showed strong presence of 
their voices on most popular social media channels (Immediate Future, 2008).
Given the prominent attributes possessed by various social media, and 
stronger interpersonal influences driven by information processing within 
social media ecosystems, the current study first differentiated various social 
media based on media characteristics along many dimensions. With the aid of 
content analysis, this study examined how corporate websites engage in vari-
ous social media channels to realize marketing and branding functions. They 
are operationalized into the following specific research questions:
RQ1: What media characteristics are possessed by different social media?
RQ2: How extensively are different social media used on the firms’ websites?
RQ3: Do social media used on the firms’ websites differ by industry type?
METHOD
Guided by research questions, a web content analysis method was employed 
to examine how firms adopt social media on their websites and how they 
utilize them to realize relationship marketing and branding functions. The 
firms under the analysis were retrieved from two industry reports—Wetpaint 
and Altimeter (2009) and Immediate Future (2008), and both of them list the

top 100 global brands in terms of social media engagement, though both use 
different approaches and methodology. Overall, there were 107 global brands 
selected for the present study: 8 in apparel, 13 in auto, 3 in business services, 
9 in consumer electronics, 11 in consumer products, 12 in financial services, 
13 in food and beverage, 6 in leisure, 4 in manufacturing, 7 in media, 9 in 
retail, and 12 in technology industries (see appendix 10.1). Considering the 
brands in this study are all global, only the individual brand’s official site 
in the United States or its English version was examined. The basic unit 
of analysis was a corporation’s complete website, which means that coders 
clicked through and coded all items presented on the homepage and then on 
all subsequent pages. The presence or absence of different social media was 
recorded, but no interpretation of the substantive meaning of the features or 
page content was made.
To obtain the intercoder reliability, two trained coders, both graduate 
students, coded 10% of the sample. The intercoder reliability for the se-
lected sample yielded an intercoder agreement ranging from .88 to .100 
for the majority variables, but the Scott’s pi coefficient reliability needed 
improvement for some variables. After a retraining session, an extra 5% 
of the firms’ sites were coded. Prior studies indicated .70 as the accepted 
criterion for Scott’s pi reliability coefficient (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997), 
and the ending reliability test for almost all variables under the study had 
reliabilities that exceed this minimum.
Social Media Category Coding Scheme
Drawing upon the literature and an initial sample of websites from these 
firms’ modalities, the following social media and other online media were 
analyzed for each individual firm’s website:
Social Networks. The presence or absence of three major social media, 
Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, were dummy coded. Specifically, the 
study recorded whether the firm established a link with the three social media 
on the firm’s sites. If not, the coders logged in to each of the three social me-
dia to check whether the company had an official channel on the social media. 
It should be noted that the current study only focused on the firm’s official 
channel established by the company, not brand interest groups launched by 
brand fans on these social media.
Branded Social Networks. Some companies build their own social net-
works on the companies’ websites for consumers or employees. These 
branded social networks have similar functions like most prevalent social 
networks sponsored by a third-party (e.g., Starbucks’s V2V, Dell’s Group), 
including personal profiles updating and interest group building. The present

Marketing and Branding in Online Social Media Environments 
169
study defined these social networks sponsored by firms as branded social 
networks. The presence or absence of these kinds of social networks on firms’ 
sites was dummy coded.
Microblog. The study first measured whether there was an icon of Twitter 
on the firm site; if not, the coders further checked if the company had estab-
lished an official account on the Twitter site. Both situations were recognized 
as presence of the social media and dummy coded.
Blogs and Forums. There are various blogs written by internal employees 
or external consumers; at the same time, there are diverse forums with dis-
cussion on the brand, products and services, or brand user experiences. To 
simplify the coding scheme, the current study only examines if these two 
online media are shown on the firm’s official website, which means that blogs 
or forums related to the brand sponsored by a third party were not recorded 
by the current study.
Tags and Social Bookmarks. A variety of tags and social bookmarking 
tools have been used on the websites. This category was coded if any tagging 
or bookmarking means like Digg, Delicious, Diggo, etc. are present on the 
firm’s sites.
Content Sharing Community. This study examined the two leading content 
sharing communities—video content community YouTube and photo content 
community Flickr. To measure whether the firms adopt these two social me-
dia channels, the study first recorded the presence or absence of the icons of 
YouTube or Flickr on the firm’s website. If not, the coders further identified 
if the company had launched an official channel on YouTube or Flickr. Either 
situation is identified as “presence” dummy coded.
Idea Sharing Community. An idea sharing community is sponsored by 
the company, where people can share ideas about a firm’s products/services, 
brand experiences, or brand involvement stories. A typical example is Star-
bucks’s My Starbucks Idea community (http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/). 
The features of an idea sharing community includes posting innovative ideas, 
sharing these ideas among members, commenting on others’ ideas, joining 
the discussion, and finally voting for certain ideas you like.
Social Mobile Platform. More and more companies utilize smart phones 
as marketing channels. Examples of such usage could include sending text 
alert information on new products, deals, promotions, or empowering certain 
search functions for store location. If the mobile icon was shown on the firm 
website, the current study recognizes it as a presence of mobile services.
Widgets. The Internet widget is a free and convenient Internet application 
that enables content available on the website that users visit often. Widgets 
are usually functioned with most social media such as social networks, blogs, 
microblogs, or personalized pages through online users’ subscriptions. If the

widget link was shown on the firm website, the current study recognizes it as 
presence and dummy coded.
RSS feeds and Podcasts. Both of these have been used in industry for some 
time, and companies usually treat them more as a means to share the brand 
information among various stakeholders. The presence of these two on the 
websites are easily recognized and dummy coded.
Games. Some companies establish a gaming function on their sites or build 
a gaming community to connect to their consumers. In particular, the gaming 
function on the website is more socialized, such as using social bookmarks/
tags to rate the game or sharing the game with friends through other social 
media. Accordingly, the present study coded the “game” category as present 
if it was socially oriented and could be shared among Internet users.
Composite Social Web. There are several Internet tools aimed to pro-
mote sharing, communication, or participation, therefore the current study 
also recorded them on these companies’ sites, including fan clubs, online 
polling/ratings, feedback tools like e-mails, e-newsletters, live chat, and 
Wikipedia links.
RESULTS
The results for RQ1 are presented in a perceptual map (see figure 10.1) and 
are produced by plotting objective scores for 16 social media comparing 8 
mass media platforms and 6 personal communication channels. Following 
orthogonal rotation of axes, figure 10.1 has a clear interpretation for various 
social media and other online media by comparison to other mass media or 
interpersonal communication channels. The horizontal axis differentiates 
from impersonal to personal communication media, and the vertical axis 
differentiates static to dynamic media. Specifically, figure 10.1 shows that 
traditional mass media occupy positions at the lower left (e.g., electronic 
media) and upper left (e.g., print media), whereas interpersonal media occupy 
lower right (e.g., telephone) and various social media largely occupy the up-
per right, which implies most of them are more personal-focused media with 
less dynamic information.
Regarding specific social media and other online media, Internet relay 
chat (or live chat) can deliver dynamic information, but is less dynamic than 
personal communication media like telephone or videophone. By compari-
son to Internet relay chat, video sharing communities deliver less dynamic 
information, while mobile messages are more personal-focused. On the other 
hand, e-newsletters occupy the upper left position with traditional print media 
such as newspapers and magazines, which implies that this social media tool

171
is more impersonal-oriented with static information. Podcast is positioned at 
the central point in Figure 10.1, which suggests that it is the most “typical” 
of communication, sharing characteristics with a wide variety of other media 
types. Specifically, podcasts, in some degree, possess the mass “broadcast-
ing” attribute, because they do not allow interaction between message senders 
and receivers. On the other hand, people can subscribe to particular podcast 
content based on his/her preferences, so they are more personal-focused. The 
content delivered by podcasts could be video or audio, which means the infor-
mation is more dynamic than other online media like message boards/forums 
or social media such as microblogs. Overall, compared to electronic media 
such as cable and broadcast television or personal communication vehicles 
like the telephone, the information delivered through online social media are 
more static. On the other side, a majority of social media are personal-focused 
in contrast to traditional mainstream electronic or print media.

To answer RQ2, the frequency of each social media and other online media 
is represented in table 10.1, which shows to what extent different social me-
dia and other online media are used on the firms’ websites. By summing up 
all scores of each social media and then averaging the summarized score by 
the 107 companies, the frequency of each social media found on the websites 
is obtained. Specifically, Facebook is the most prevalent social media used by 
these companies (M = .95). The next two popular channels are LinkedIn (M = 
.93) and online feedback tools like e-mail (M = .93). Meanwhile, 78% of the 
companies under the study launched a Twitter account, while 62% of them 
use RSS feeds on their sites. The least used other online media are Wikipedia 
(M = .06) and games (M = .07). The remaining channels have frequencies 
ranging from 10% to 60%.
To examine whether social media adoption varied by different industries, 
the present study first computed a summary score of all social media and 
other online media for each industry and then averaged them by the num-
ber of companies in the industry. The average scores reported in table 10.2 
represent the volume of various social media used by the 12 industries.

Specifically, the media industry (M = 17.71) and technology industry (M = 
16.75) under the study show much higher social media engagement scores 
than the others, which suggest that these two business sectors are aggres-
sive in adopting a variety of social media and other online media on their 
websites. The leisure and business services industries are found to possess 
the same score (M = 9.67). By comparison, the financial sector has the low-
est average score out of all companies in this study (M = 6.42). The overall 
rankings of social media engagement from the highest to lowest among 
the 12 industries are media, technology, consumer electronics, auto, retail, 
business services, leisure, consumer products, manufacturing, food and 
beverage, apparel, and financial.
Furthermore, the present study computed the average scores of each social 
media for different industries to investigate the variations in each social me-
dia adoption related to specific business sector (see table 10.3). Regarding the 
three social media examined, Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, it appears 
that Facebook is the leading social media for all business sectors except the 
manufacturing industry, while LinkedIn also has a relative higher presence 
across all industries. However, nearly all business sectors tend not to incor-
porate MySpace on their official sites or establish a channel on the social 
media. In terms of branded social networks sponsored by the companies, 
only the media (M = 1.00) and technology (M = .83) industries have widely 
adopted this social media channel, whereas the majority of business sectors 
seldom have this practice. Moreover, blogs are found to be most apparent 
in the media sector, while message boards/forums are most evident in the 
technology sector. Furthermore, the leisure companies in the sample all have 
launched accounts in Twitter in addition to the media and technology sec-
tors. Furthermore, regarding video and photo content sharing communities,

nearly all technology (M = 1.00) and auto companies (M = .92) have official 
channels in video sharing community YouTube, and the consumer products 
(M = 1.00) and auto (M = .92) industries have a high presence in photo shar-
ing community Flickr. Idea sharing communities seems to be only evident 
in the technology industry (M = .75), but online polling/rating functions are 
most used by the consumer electronics (M = .89) business sector.
CONCLUSION
This study recognized that each of the social media is unique and functions 
differently to deepen the consumer relationship and build brand loyalty, 
therefore the study first explored social media characteristics along many 
dimensions comparing traditional mass and personal communication chan-
nels. Based on the assumption that companies would take advantages of 
different attributes possessed by each of the social media to realize diverse 
relationship marketing and branding purposes, the present study conducted 
a web content analysis to investigate how extensively a variety of social 
media were used on the corporate websites and whether social media adop-
tion varies by industry type.
Specifically, the conceptual map of media typology indicates that social 
media are more personal and conversational compared to traditional elec-
tronic or print media, while the information delivered through social media 
are less dynamic than personal communication platforms. With respect to 
each individual social media and other online media, there indeed exist some 
variations along the two attribute dimensions. For example, e-newsletters, 
RSS feeds, podcasts, and online polling/rating are less personal-focused than 
social media, while mobile and live chat deliver more dynamic information. 
These diverse characteristics inherent in each social media enable industry 
practitioners to utilize them as niche marketing tools to effectively target dif-
ferent media users and consumers.
Taking social networks as an example, from the marketers’ perspective, 
implementing listening programs through social networks could obtain au-
thentic knowledge from consumers; meanwhile “endorsement by consumers 
in the form of friending/following/subscribing validates their efforts and 
activates a viral distribution of their brand across channels” (IAB, 2009, 
p. 4). Regarding video content sharing communities, syndicated video en-
ables marketers to reach a large targeted audience with a richer and more in-
teractive medium. The most popular website, YouTube, allows both individu-
als and businesses to share interactive content easily and freely. Moreover, 
based on blogs’ conversational nature and affinity with readers, blogs could

provide marketers with additional information of consumer behavior and in-
tent. Idea sharing communities, which allows companies to capitalize on their 
consumers’ creative ideas in product innovation and design, create incentives 
for people’s attention and engagement, and finally deliver valuable input to 
reward both sides—the ultimate goal of relationship marketing.
Based on the assumption that each social medium functions with different 
marketing and branding purposes, the current study empirically examined 
how a range of social media were adopted in industry. It is not surprising 
that Facebook and LinkedIn are two leading social media adopted by these 
companies due to their large subscriber bases; 95% of firms under the study 
have launched an official channel on Facebook, while 93% of them have a 
presence on LinkedIn to build relationships with their potential or existing 
customers. Moreover, the current study found that the two social media are 
used differently by companies for divergent purposes. Specifically, the com-
panies engaged in Facebook are more likely to share product/service infor-
mation or deals/promotion news, create event invitations, and connect with 
partners, while the use of LinkedIn is more focused on recruiting, networking, 
and fostering discussions. Furthermore, 78% of companies in the study have 
launched an official account on Twitter, where they share the latest product 
information with consumers, discuss thoughts and ideas, and respond to con-
sumers’ feedback on brand experiences.
In regard to social media adoption by different industries, the companies 
under study place different emphasis on a variety of social media to best 
match their relationship marketing and branding purpose. Overall, media and 
technology industries appeared to be more aggressive to engage in social 
media than other industries, which might reflect principles delineated in the 
resource-based view of strategy (Conner & Prahalad, 1996). In other words, 
the offline resources and capabilities of a firm are likely to play a role in its 
online strategy. In this case, it is likely that media companies would capital-
ize on their information gathering and reporting competency, and technology 
firms benefited from their expertise on advanced technologies and online 
applications by deploying a wide range of relevant social media and other 
online media like social bookmarking, blogs, and RSS feeds.
Furthermore, the different social media approaches seem to reflect the di-
vergent offline product nature by different industries. The auto and consumer 
electronics industries more tend to create channels on video or photo content 
sharing communities to demonstrate their newer, innovative products, as 
these social media are more easily used to enhance brand knowledge and

involvement through multimedia formats. Comparatively, the media industry 
seems less likely to launch a presence or set up links with content sharing 
communities sponsored by a third-party like YouTube or Flickr, which re-
flect the rich media resources possessed by traditional mass media platforms. 
More important, a majority of mass organizations provide the function of 
uploading user-generated video or photo content inside their own websites, 
sharing them among the local community.
In summary, based on a media typology model along several media char-
acteristic dimensions, the study first differentiated diverse social media and 
other online media comparing mass and personal communication channels. 
By conducting a content analysis on the utilization of social media on the top 
100 global brand websites, the study found that Facebook and LinkedIn are 
the leading social media used by these companies. The variations in social 
media adoption also differ by industry type that might indicate the offline 
resources and capabilities of a firm are likely to play a role in its online social 
relationship marketing and branding strategies.
The implications of this research must be tempered by an understanding 
of its limitations. Though the top brands selected may represent or predict 
the future modality of social media adoption across different industries, it 
is difficult to generalize the results to the whole business sector; therefore, 
future research might focus on certain industries and use a random sampling 
method to produce generalized conclusions. Moreover, each of the social 
media functions with diverse features, and a more detailed coding scheme is 
needed in order to capture their distinct attributes for marketing functional-
ity. It would also be interesting to approach the concept of social media us-
age within industry sites from the audience perspectives. Such studies might 
provide insight on the actual contribution of social media in complementing 
companies’ customer relationship development.

Chapter Eleven
Social Media and the 
Millennial Generation 
in the 2010 Midterm Election
John Allen Hendricks and Jerry K. Frye
The 2008 political campaign was a landmark campaign regarding social media 
usage and impact. Hendricks and Denton (2010) state: “the 2008 campaign was 
unique in that it became the first national campaign in which traditional media 
such as television, radio, and newspapers were overshadowed by new media 
technologies and the Internet” (p. xi). The usage of social media by Barack 
Obama changed the way in which future political campaigns will occur. Hence-
forth, social media will play a prominent role in American politics. Particularly, 
social media will be used by and have an impact upon 18–29 year olds who 
are politically active and are technologically savvy. Social media activities are 
one of the most popular web activities. Interestingly, Goldsmith (2008) reports,
one of the major shifts in Internet use in the past decade had been the fall off 
in interest in pornography or adult entertainment sites . . . surfing for porn had 
dropped to about 10 percent of searches from 20 percent a decade ago, and the 
hottest Internet searches now are for social networking sites (para. 6–7).
This statistic is especially applicable to the 18–24-year-olds. Accordingly, this 
chapter attempts to examine the role of social media in the twenty-first-century 
political process and the role it plays in attracting traditionally apathetic de-
mographics to participate in the American democratic process, making it more 
inclusive and more robust. This chapter provided an examination of the usage 
and impact of both social media and the Millennial generation during the 2010 
midterm election in the California gubernatorial campaign and the Kentucky 
U.S. Senate campaign. Specifically, this study attempted to determine patterns 
of usage for the candidates in the 2010 campaign and determine emerging 
themes from their use of the social media of Facebook and Twitter.

John Allen Hendricks and Jerry K. Frye
SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE 2010 CAMPAIGN
In 2010, social media usage was not as aggressive as it was in 2008. The two 
social media technologies that seemed to be the most popular were Twitter 
and Facebook. Twitter received significant attention and usage as Alterian, 
a marketing firm, reported that 36% of all 2010 election Internet conversa-
tions occurred in Twitter followed by Facebook and MySpace, with 20% of 
the Internet traffic (PRsarahevans, 2010, para. 2; Reynolds, 2010; Alterian.
com, 2010). Thus, a total of 56% of the midterm election conversation took 
place online compared to only 19.3% of the election coverage conversation 
taking place via traditional media outlets (PRsarahevans, 2010). Calabrese 
(2010) asserted:
If 2008 was the year that social networks like Facebook and Twitter broke 
through to mainstream America, then 2010 is shaping up to be the election 
year that’s defined by social media. Consider that three out of five Americans 
who consider themselves somewhat politically active are members of a social 
network . . . (para. 1–2)
Although Facebook, with its online vote counter, and Twitter, with its #vote-
report hashtag, played the most prominent roles during the 2010 midterm 
election, Foursquare also played its part (Howie, 2010). Foursquare, a social 
media that allows users to “check in” at certain locations, also played a role 
in the 2010 elections. Foursquare provided electronic versions of “I Voted” 
badges for social media users to post to their Facebook pages once a user con-
firmed they had voted (Howie, 2010). The trend that emerged from the 2010 
midterm election appears to be that “we’re seeing an expansion in people’s 
expectation that voting is meant to be a social experience, something that 
they share with their family, friends, and strangers—whether on Facebook, 
Foursquare, or Twitter” (Scola, 2010, para. 5).
MILLENNIALS, TECHNOLOGY, AND POLITICS
Ideally, the American democratic process works at its best when participatory 
levels are at their highest and all citizens exercise their civic responsibility to 
cast a vote. The Millennial generation has proved to be an active voting de-
mographic (Hendricks & Denton, 2010; Hendricks & Kaid, 2011). Members 
of the Millennials include those between the ages of 18–29 and were born 
between 1982 and 2003 (Winograd & Hais, 2008). Above all, the Millen-
nial generation is the largest in American history (Winograd & Hais, 2008). 
In fact, it is 21% larger than even the Baby Boom generation (Greenberg &

Weber, 2008, p. 20). The “Millennials are the most ethnically diverse genera-
tion in American history” (Winograd & Hais, 2008, p. 2). Howe and Strauss 
(2000) noted that the Millennials “. . . are more numerous, more affluent, bet-
ter educated, and more ethnically diverse” than any generation before it (p. 4).
Indeed, the Millennials are set to become a juggernaut in American soci-
ety and American politics. Greenberg and Weber (2008) assert: “There are 
enough of them that today’s youth could become a political force that could 
dominate all political factions and institutions if they are united and share 
beliefs and long-term planetary orientation” (p. 4). Also, Greenberg and 
Weber (2008) posit: “. . . they’ve begun affecting the outcome of national 
elections, especially as participation rates by young voters climb steadily” 
(p. 21). The Millennials are a technologically savvy generation. The members 
of this generation have never known a period in their lives when technology 
did not play a significant role of some kind and advancements in technology 
have grown by leaps and bounds during their lives. Greenberg and Weber 
(2008) observed:
[The Millennial Generation] includes the people who have made social network-
ing (Facebook, MySpace, and so on) an important technological and societal 
trend. They live on instant messaging (IM), text each other continually, and 
have created entire new industries such as massive multi-player online gaming 
. . . They’ve made the Internet the world’s most important and fastest growing 
medium for entertainment and information. (p. 20)
For twenty-first-century politics, Johnson (2009) acknowledges, “. . . social 
networking sites, like Facebook and MySpace, have become important com-
munication links. Added to this is the enormous potential of cell phone text 
messaging and Twitter, the social networking and micro-blogging service” 
(p. 17). All of which are enthusiastically embraced by Millennials.
Winograd and Hais (2008) assert, “This emerging generation has a pen-
chant for getting its information from the Net, especially on social networking 
sites” (p. 164). For future politicians to be successful on Election Day they 
must integrate social media strategies into their campaigning and they must 
target the Millennials. Politicians desiring to hold a high elected office in 
America can no longer ignore this emerging voting bloc as the numbers are 
simply staggering. Winograd and Hais (2008) estimate that, “By 2012 the 
first half of the entire Millennial Generation, approximately 40 million young 
Americans, will be eligible to vote. The history of political realignments sug-
gests that the realignment shaped in 2008 by this generation’s oldest members 
will be confirmed and solidified when whoever is elected that year runs for 
reelection” (p. 7). Moreover, Tapscott (2009) asserts that “The Net Gen-
eration [Millennials] is turning into a political juggernaut that will dominate

twenty-first-century politics in America. Indeed, they have the numbers to 
do it. Already they are one-fifth of overall voters, and by 2015, once they all 
are old enough to vote, they will be one-third of the voting public” (p. 244).
THE MILLENNIALS AND THE 2010 MIDTERM CAMPAIGN
The political views held by the majority of the Millennials do favor Demo-
cratic candidates. Tapscott (2009) states that Millennials usually vote “. . . 
for a Democrat and for socially progressive people and causes” (p. 244). 
However, the Millennials were unable to keep the Democratic Party in con-
trol of all three branches of the federal government during the 2010 midterm 
elections. Although the 2010 congressional elections did shift the power of 
the U.S. House of Representatives from the Democrats to the Republicans, 
the Democrats did maintain control of the U.S. Senate. Polling data and an-
ecdotal evidence suggests that Millennials simply did not participate in the 
2010 midterm elections in large numbers. Observers suggest that there are 
several factors that contributed to this lack of participation in 2010 including 
the “usual midterm effect” where enthusiasm levels are traditionally low for 
all demographics (Cave, 2010). Of the 18–29 year olds eligible to vote in the 
2010 midterm election, only 20.9% chose to do so, which was a 25% drop 
from the 2006 midterm elections (Bauerlein, 2010). As Tapscott (2009) and 
Bauerlein (2010) noted, even with a lower voter turnout among the youth in 
2010, they still supported Democratic candidates over Republican candidates 
57% to 40%. In addition to voting for more Democrats than Republicans 
during the 2010 midterm elections, the Millennials also gave more money to 
the Democrats. Political donations from college students to Democrats were 
almost 20 times more than the donations given to Republicans by college 
students (“College Students’ Campaign Contributions,” 2010). In early 2010, 
the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press reported that the poor 
economy, high unemployment rates that have affected younger Americans 
worse than older Americans, and public anger toward the U.S. government 
in general had eroded some of the support the Millennials had given the 
Democrats in 2008.
Connelly and Marsh (2010) reported that midterm exit polls indicated that 
“Voters under 30 were the only age group to support Democrats but made up 
just 11 percent of the electorate, typical for a midterm election. By contrast, 
voters aged 60 and older represented 34 percent of voters, their highest pro-
portion in exit polls since 1982” (para. 6). The 2010 midterm election remains 
a reminder of the prominent role that Millennial voters will play in future 
American politics as Carberry (2010), a member of the Millennial generation,

Social Media and the Millennial Generation in the 2010 Midterm Election

astutely asserts that “Many say that the historic election was an isolated mo-
ment in time and that momentum has plateaued, but 2008 was the beginning 
of something that will manifest itself in the coming decade, starting with 
November’s midterm election, to 2012, 2014 and beyond as our nation’s 
demographics shift toward majority Millennial voters” (para. 3).
THE 2010 MIDTERM CAMPAIGN CASE STUDY: 
CALIFORNIA AND KENTUCKY
On October 20, 2010, just days prior to the midterm election, Real Clear 
Politics released a snapshot of polling data that showed the nation’s approval 
rating of President Obama, the U.S. Congress (both the House and the Sen-
ate), and whether citizens thought the country was moving in the right direc-
tion (Real Clear Politics, 2010). The poll revealed that President Obama’s 
job approval rating was at 49.3% disapproval and a 45.7% approval rating; 
Congress’s job approval rating was at 71.6% disapproval and a 21.2% ap-
proval rating; while only 31% thought the country was moving in the right 
direction and 62.6% thought the country was on the wrong track (Real Clear 
Politics, 2010). Thus, the 2010 midterm election that swept a majority of Re-
publicans into the U.S. House of Representatives and gave them control of its 
leadership can be attributed to the poor approval ratings of both Congress and 
the President. Tumulty and Balz (2010), reporters for The Washington Post, 
noted that “In his own assessments of what went wrong, the president has 
lamented his inability to persuade voters on the merits of what he has done, 
and blamed the failure on his preoccupation with a full plate of crises” (para. 
2). As noted, the Republicans wrestled control of the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives from the Democrats and now serve in all leadership positions of 
that chamber. That is not the case with the U.S. Senate as Democrats retained 
their majority in that chamber and retained all leadership positions there. Re-
garding the gubernatorial races during the 2010 midterm elections, The New 
York Times reported that Democrats lost six seats bringing the total number 
of Democratic governors to 20, the Republicans won six seats bringing the 
total number of Republican governors to 29, with one Independent governor 
(“Election 2010: Governor Map,” 2010).
METHOD
This was a qualitative, exploratory study that used textual analysis to exam-
ine the usage of social media of the candidates. Regarding textual analysis,

188 
John Allen Hendricks and Jerry K. Frye
Poindexter and McCombs (2000) assert that “. . . researchers use the content 
from these various media sources to interpret or criticize society or culture 
as an influencer of the media content or text” (p. 291). Further, textual 
analysis “. . . seeks to use interpretations to define the culture that produced 
this communication content” (p. 291). Accordingly, the authors captured all 
Facebook postings and tweets of the candidates that were sent and/or posted 
during October 2010, the month prior to Election Day 2010 and leading up 
to Election Day.
Because evidence does support the assertion that the Millennial voting bloc 
and the usage of social media by politicians are important factors in modern 
elections, the gubernatorial campaign studied was California with Republi-
can, and former eBay CEO, Meg Whitman running against Democrat, and 
former Governor, Jerry Brown. PRsarahevans (2010) reports that the Califor-
nia gubernatorial campaign was one of the most discussed campaigns on so-
cial media outlets. The U.S. Senate campaign studied was between Kentucky 
Republican, and physician, Dr. Rand Paul and Democrat, and attorney, Jack 
Conway. In the California gubernatorial race, Jerry Brown won 53.8%, of 
the total votes compared to Meg Whitman’s 40.9% of the total vote (Election 
Results California, 2010). Nichols (2010) reported that young voter turnout 
was low in the 2010 midterm election. He stated that, “In 2010, polls showed 
that young people were still supportive of Obama and the Democrats. But 
only 20.9 percent of them bothered to vote” (Nichols, 2010, para. 3). Spe-
cifically in California, the voter turnout for the 18–29 year old demographic, 
or the Millennials, was only 11% compared to 18% in 2008 (Fahey, 2010). 
In Kentucky, Rand Paul won 55.8% of the total votes while his opponent 
received 44.2% of the total votes (Kentucky, 2010). Data were unavailable 
for Millennial voter turnout in the 2010 midterm election in Kentucky. But, 
prior to the Kentucky election, a Survey USA poll conducted for the Louis-
ville Courier-Journal and WHAS-TV indicated that Rand Paul would garner 
60% of the 18–34 year olds votes compared to his challenger, Jack Conway, 
garnering only 33% of the Millennial support (Benson, 2010).
CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN: 
BROWN VERSUS WHITMAN
Twitter. Jerry Brown’s campaign used Twitter, with 1.1 million followers, to 
provide quick and specific information to his supporters (http://twitter.com/
JerryBrown2010; Kravets, 2010). Some tweets provided: 1) links to video or 
pictures of campaign activities, such as his speech on election night with an 
introduction from his wife, or ways in which you could help the campaign

Social Media and the Millennial Generation in the 2010 Midterm Election

[hot link]. The Brown campaign took full advantage of the various Twit-
ter features of Retweet, TweetDeck, reply, blog, status, Tweet Button, and 
Twitter API (Application Programming Interface), a way for a program in 
Twitter to do tasks such as sharing live comments with a Facebook account. 
2) Other tweets focused on a general campaign theme: join the campaign to 
get California working again, read about Jerry, volunteer, donate and pro-
vided a consistency and image of unity for supporters. And, the redundancy 
features of social media were fully employed as illustrated by the use of 
identical messages which repeatedly appeared in both Twitter and Facebook. 
3) Sometimes innovative tweets indicated a recurring campaign activity with 
clever, attention-getting social media spelling, as in “Phonebank Phriday! 
http://bit.ly/cil3kH October 22, 2010 1:03:13 PM CDT via TweetDeck Reply 
Retweet http://twitter.com/JerryBrown2010 10/27/10 12:31 PM.” 4) Some 
tweets were tweet-specific, focused on a single task as in one which stated: 
“Here is a window sign you can print yourself! http://bit.ly/bM1MO5 Octo-
ber 23, 2010 2:28:01 PM CDT” and at other times, multiple-tweet tasks were 
presented in a single tweet, e.g., alerting supporters to new campaign vehicles 
and attacking the opponent, as in the following tweet: “New Jerry Brown TV 
ad. Title: Meg Whitman: ‘Why I moved to California.’ Watch it here: http://
bit.ly/bmtRwd October 25, 2010 12:00:59 PM CDDT via web Retweeted by 
JerryBrown2010 and 31 others.” Brown’s tweets contained wide-ranging top-
ics including thanking supporters, campaign activities alerts, voting informa-
tion (deadlines, polling locations, vote by mail instructions), donations, links 
to connect with Twitter and Facebook contacts, along with rally images of 
pictures and video.
Facebook. Jerry Brown not only used Facebook effectively to communi-
cate with 98,000 friends/fans, but he also demonstrated his seasoned skills 
as a career politician through this social networking medium (http://www
.facebook.com/jerrybrown; Kravets, 2010). Cleverly, the Brown campaign 
used Facebook to promote the usage of other social media platforms. For 
example, a Facebook post suggested that Flickr and YouTube could be used 
to watch campaign pictures and video. One post asked: “Are you on Twitter? 
Here’s a video on how you can help the campaign: Social Media Webisode 
3: Twitter” which gave lessons on how to use Twitter to help Brown. Another 
post suggested specific action, by stating: “Add this badge to your profile to 
show your friends who won the debate! Get your Jerry Brown for Governor 
Facebook Supporter Badge! Show your support for our cause! Install the 
Jerry Brown for Governor ‘Donate to Jerry Brown for Governor’ Facebook 
Supporter Badge on your Facebook profile. Click the image to get your own 
badge!” Repeatedly, posts were related to supporting Brown and educating 
voters about Brown such as “join the campaign to get California working

John Allen Hendricks and Jerry K. Frye
again, read about Jerry, volunteer, or donate.” Frequently, posts included 
“hot links” that made participation easy and quick. Other posts gave clear and 
helpful encouragement to show support through various Facebook utilities 
and features. Another post combined positive responses by asking, “Why did 
my opponent come to California? Are you one of the nearly 400,000 people 
who watched this video to find out? If you haven’t seen it, take a look, and 
please use the ‘Share’ link.” His posts also mentioned numerous endorse-
ments of individuals and newspapers.
Other posts consisted of: 1) blog posts and guest blogs from campaign 
staff and/or supporters, 2) thank-you messages from Brown (to military, to 
various supportive groups, and other citizens) and even specifically named 
campaign staff members, for example, Brown’s post reads, “Congratulations 
to the campaign insider, Carly, for her 100th blog post! http://www.jerry-
brown.org/blog/endorsements-galore,” 3) participation invitations to submit 
ideas of how to get California working again (government; jobs; economy), 
4) share speeches, rally content, campaign blogs together with YouTube 
video, 5) encourage active participation such as: “here is something else I 
need you to vote on; help us decide which are the top campaign ads with a 
focus on the Whitman ad: Why I Came To California; Echo, or the Sarah 
Palin attack ad;” join phone banks, 6) requests to get out the vote and infor-
mation about how to find your polling place, 7) sports congratulations (base-
ball champions, San Francisco Giants); and multiple posts that repeated, for 
instance, “Appropriate for the Orange and Black to win on Halloween—San 
Francisco Giants one to go!,” 8) encouragement to contact other Facebook 
friends and suggestions to use the California Democratic Party’s Facebook 
application to contact targeted voters and help round up the support needed 
to win on Election Day, 9) time, place, and directions to rallies and various 
campaign events (e.g., debates), and 10) pictures, videos of supporters across 
the state to join him at rallies to help get out the vote; 128 photos.
In general, the Brown campaign’s Facebook postings were confident, up-
beat, positive, encouraging, and focused on specific ways to request help and 
continued support. Collectively, the posts projected an image of a confident 
candidate intent on providing positive support and encouragement to his sup-
porters and a willingness to directly confront his opponent. Above all, Brown 
used Facebook to both refute charges from his opponent while simultaneously 
attacking his opponent. The Brown campaign used Facebook to unleash a 
barrage of attacks on Whitman while simultaneously stating his position on 
the same issues that included: 1) eliminating the capital gains tax, 2) job cre-
ation, 3) Whitman plays politics with the pension fund, 4) Whitman’s facts 
on education are false, 5) Whitman’s atrocious voting record, and 6) Whit-

man’s position on illegal immigration is riddled with inconsistencies. Brown 
continuously flaunted his support of “star studded” supporters such as former 
President Bill Clinton and always made sure to announce well in advance the 
locations and times of his next campaign stop with such luminaries as the 
former president.
Twitter. Meg Whitman, former eBay CEO and billionaire, spent an esti-
mated $140 million of her own money to campaign for the California’s gov-
ernor’s office (http://twitter.com/Whitman2010; Lawrence, 2010). Whitman 
used Twitter to campaign with more than 240,000 followers, as of the end of 
September 2010. Her tweets consisted of: 1) invitations to watch videos with 
the links to videos such as her interview with FOX News Channel’s Sean 
Hannity or videos on her campaign platforms for California, 2) generic state-
ments about how California can be a great state and better days are ahead of 
it, 3) reminders to vote, 4) comments about event turnouts and door/phone 
contacts made by her campaign, 5) announcements of what her campaign 
stops were like for the day, 6) directions to her homepage, 7) links to news-
paper articles that were positive about her candidacy, and 8) mentions of key 
endorsements. Overall, the tweets from the Whitman campaign during the 
final days of the election were generally not calls-to-action and most tweets 
were of events after they occurred rather than invitations and directions to 
her campaign events. One tweet stated: “Looking forward to rallies around 
the state today. On the road to A New California! #cagov #gomeg October 
30, 2010 11:22:28 AM CDT via web.” A Whitman supporter would not be 
able to know where those rallies were being held by reading the tweet alone. 
Another pattern that appeared in Whitman’s tweets was that most tweets were 
after the event had occurred. An example of this includes the following tweet: 
“Visited a fruit packing plant this afternoon—agriculture is one of CA’s key 
industries. #cagov #gomeg http://twitpic.com/2zn1ob 6:59 PM Oct 21st via 
Twitpic.” Of all Whitman’s tweets, very few, were calls-to-action or invita-
tions to get involved in her campaign. But, here is one of the few examples 
where the Whitman campaign encouraged supporters to help: “We need your 
help in the homestretch! Find your nearest volunteer office: www.megwhit-
man.com/fieldoffices #cagov #gomeg October 21, 2010 1:29:18 PM CDT via 
web.” There appeared to be no political themes that emerged from Whitman’s 
tweets such as the poor economy that California was facing.
Facebook. The Meg Whitman campaign also utilized Facebook as a me-
dium to communicate with California voters with more than 200,000 friends 
(http://www.facebook.com/megwhitman). Whitman was labeled the “most 
friended” candidate in the 2010 midterm election (Gavin, 2010). Her posts 
consisted of: 1) encouraging people to vote. For example, “Good morning

John Allen Hendricks and Jerry K. Frye
on Election Day! Go to www.megwhitman.com/vote to find your polling 
place! Pass along to friends!” 2) encouraging people to share their favorite 
photos that indicated support for Meg, 3) some posts discussed the number 
of door and/or phone contacts that had been made by the campaign, 4) there 
were many posts that simply thanked various supporters, while other posts 
announced key endorsements and links to the actual endorsement video. 
She also stated, “Thank you to Governor Chris Christie for this video en-
dorsement! Please reshare on your wall by hitting the ‘Share’ link below!” 
5) posts indicated where she had campaigned on a particular day and how 
much fun they had. Whitman posted, “We’ve been all over the state on 
our Jobs bus—read about the fun we’ve had, event by event!” The “Jobs 
Bus” was a recurring theme in Facebook postings reminding supporters 
that she would work hard for Californians to create new jobs, and 6) posts 
led friends to op-ed pieces and news stories that supported Whitman’s 
campaign. In general, Whitman’s Facebook postings were relatively be-
nign and steered far away from the issues of the campaign and/or anything 
controversial. The closest any of her Facebook postings came to discussing 
a negative campaign issue was a post when Whitman stated, “New TV ad 
out. Jerry Brown admits ‘It’s all a lie . . . I didn’t have a plan for CA.’ No 
plan then, no plan now.”
Whitman did utilize Facebook to motivate and engage voters to get in-
volved in the democratic process. Her Facebook posts included clever ways 
of getting “friends” to share their endorsement of her on their Facebook 
pages. For example, one Whitman post introduced a “Twibbon” that friends 
could download and it would appear on their profile pictures on their Face-
book page showing their support for the Whitman campaign. The post stated, 
“Show your support for Meg 2010 by adding a Twibbon to your Facebook 
profile picture (http://twb.ly/cmbrfj)—it takes less than a minute. A Twibbon 
overlays Meg’s logo on top of your existing profile picture—you can even 
choose the placement of the logo. Give it a try (and be sure to set the new 
image as your profile picture)!” In a Whitman Facebook post, she introduced 
a Facebook app that supporters could download: “Volunteers: Use our new 
Facebook app (http://meg4.me/volunteercentral) to easily tell your Facebook 
friends how and where you’re volunteering. This is a fun way to let your 
Facebook friends know how hard you are working to elect Meg. The applica-
tion is also accessible using the ‘Volunteers’ tab on my page.” Whitman also 
introduced a mobile program on a Facebook post that allowed supporters to 
text a specific number and receive a free bumper sticker. Whitman posted: 
“Join our mobile program and receive campaign updates by text! Text mes-
sage ‘FB’ to 46634 (GOMEG).”

KENTUCKY U.S. SENATE CAMPAIGN: 
PAUL VERSUS CONWAY
Twitter. Although limited, Dr. Rand Paul, a Kentucky eye surgeon, used 
Twitter to campaign with 10,882 followers (http://twitter.com/DrRandPaul). 
Paul’s use of Twitter was very limited. His tweets consisted of the following: 
1) reminding voters that the polls were open, 2) informing followers of his 
speaking engagements and other appearances, 3) counterattacking his oppo-
nent’s comments. Paul stated, “Action Requested: Help Us Catch Conway’s 
Dirty Tricks.” Paul tweeted, “@DrRandPaul is right. @ConwayForKY has 
flip-flopped on cap & trade. I’ve reported this for MONTHS. @Conway
ForKY is sadly lying.” 4) tweets reported newspaper endorsements, times of 
press conferences, and appearances on television. Paul tweeted, “Rand will 
be on Fox News America Live with Megyn Kelly at 1:33 Eastern.” His tweets 
also offered observations about his television appearances such as his appear-
ance on MSNBC, with Dr. Rachel Maddow, where there was a 15-minute 
debate between the two over Paul’s questioning the constitutionality of parts 
of the Civil Rights Act. Paul subsequently tweeted: “Wow. Who knew going 
on MSNBC could backfire?” 5) there were specific issue related tweets such 
as his tweet “Has two tickets to the gun show. And the endorsement of Gun 
Owners of America.” And, finally, his tweets included call-to-actions such as 
“Help Rand make the phone calls and door knocks he needs to finish strong 
in the final 30 days by volunteering at . . .”
Facebook. The Rand Paul campaign also utilized Facebook to communicate 
with Kentucky voters with more than 92,000 friends (http://www.facebook
.com/RandPaul2010). The Rand campaign recognized the importance of social 
media, particularly the importance of Facebook. In fact, to increase the num-
ber of “friends” that he had on Facebook, Paul’s Senate campaign announced 
a contest called, “Facebook ‘Friend Bomb’ on Sunday August 1st,” that was 
designed to add 100,000 new “friends” to his Facebook page. The top five 
recruiters would be awarded the opportunity to have lunch with Paul (Good, 
2010). As Good (2010) noted: “. . . Rand Paul doesn’t want your money. He 
just wants to be friends, and for his campaign events and musings to show up 
in your news feed. And to remind you that politics is about popularity contests, 
especially online nowadays” (para. 4).
Similar to all politicians, Rand Paul utilized Facebook to communicate 
with and motivate voters. His Facebook posts included: 1) expressing appre-
ciation for financial support, requesting financial support with a link to do so, 
thanks for endorsements, and announcements of press conferences, 2) posts 
also included call-to-actions for help with his campaign. Paul posted: “Help

final 30 days by volunteering at your local Victory office! Click here: http://
bit.ly/cjK1EP for locations across Kentucky,” 3) posts reminded friends to 
watch his appearances on television programs as well as watch his cam-
paign’s TV ads. Paul also posted, “Have you seen our new ad? It talks about 
Jack Conway’s Stamp of Approval of Obama and his policies. Enjoy- http://
www.youtube.com/users/randpaul.” He also posted video of his television 
appearances with links for friends to watch, 4) there were continuing posts, or 
threads, from Rand Paul directed at his opponent, Jack Conway. In one post, 
Paul stated, “Here’s a new video condemning the shameless attacks of Jack 
Conway—using not our words, but those of the liberal media” with a link to 
the video. Finally, following his victory, although it contained a misspelling, 
he posted to his friends: “Thank you the people of Kentucky and to everyone 
who supporter [sic] our campaign!” In sum, Rand Paul utilized Facebook 
quite effectively to communicate with his supporters, yet there is no evidence 
that his victory was a result of this social media.
Twitter. Jack Conway’s campaign used the social media platform of 
Twitter, with 2,251 followers, to provide quick and specific information 
to his supporters (http://twitter.com/ConwayforKy). His tweets included: 
1) thanks and encouragement to supporters, “Thanks to everyone who helped 
us have a great financial quarter, have you signed up to volunteer? http://
ky.jackconway.org/apjcz #KYSen 9:40 AM Oct 4th via web Reply Retweet,” 
2) voting information (time left to vote, polling location, encouragement 
to vote) as evidenced by “Make sure you know where to go vote tomor-
row morning. Look up your polling location here: http://jackconway.org/
election-center/November 1, 2010 7:10:03 PM CDT via HootSuite Reply 
Retweet” and “Knocking on doors, making phone calls, and reminding vot-
ers to vote tomorrow—This is how we win. #KYDems November 1, 2010 
10:45:12 AM CDT via HootSuite Reply Retweet,” 3) providing information 
about campaign events, for example, “Join President Clinton tomorrow at 
the University of Louisville, find out more. http://ht.ly/32cjY October 31, 
2010 1:20:16 PM CDT via HootSuite Reply Retweet,” 4) attacking his op-
ponent with tweets such as “The Lexington Herald Leader said @drrandpaul 
is lying. http://bit.ly/aDfZ4G #KYSen 6:54 PM Oct 25th via web” or again 
“Stop Rand Paul’s plan to eliminate student loans. Come to the phone bank 
and say he just doesn’t get KY. #KYSen http://ht.ly/32anT October 31, 2010 
12:45:03 PM CDT via HootSuite” or sometimes his tweets combined an 
attack by focusing on a specific campaign issue, for example, “Headed to 
Greenup county to talk to seniors about why @drrandpaul’s $2,000 medicare 
deductible isnt [sic] right for them #KYDems October 29, 2010 9:13:15 AM 
CDT via HootSuite” and sometimes included extreme attacks, for example,

“@drrandpaul you returned money from the attacker. Now will you return 
the money you took from pornographers? #headstomp 6:10 PM Oct 26th 
via HootSuite” and again “@drrandpaul starting to return donations. What 
about the money from white separatists? Will you return that? 4:58 PM Oct 
26th via HootSuite,” 5) positive statements combined with a specific cam-
paign issue, for example, “Great BBQ & conversation in Owensboro. Issue 
here same as everywhere, who has a real plan for jobs in KY? October 27, 
2010 1:00:09 PM CDT via HootSuite,” 6) endorsements, for example, “The 
Courier-Journal endorses Jack Conway for U.S. Senate: http://bit.ly/aBR7JB 
#KYSen #Retweetthis [sic] October 24, 2010 11:18:03 AM CDT via web.” 
The Conway tweets frequently contain opponent attacks and suggest a very 
combative, frustrated candidate. For example, “I will protect KY seniors and 
I won’t take a lecture in constitutional law from a self-certified ophthalmolo-
gist. http://bit.ly/ckCOph October 15, 2010 12:02:19 PM CDT.” The major-
ity of the standard, typical Twitter features were used by Conway such as 
HootSuite, Reply, Retweet, and the web. These were used repeatedly with 
little evidence of innovative use. The impression was an unsophisticated use 
of Twitter focused on combative opponent attacks.
Facebook. Jack Conway used the social media platform of Facebook, 
with 8,936 friends, to encourage the use of other social media (http://www
.facebook.com/pages/Jack-Conway-for-Kentucky). Characteristic posts by 
the Conway campaign included: 1) encouragement of supporters to partici-
pate, such as “Have you reminded your neighbors that tomorrow is Election 
Day? Call them now: http://ht.ly/32 Bep” and “Just like your vote makes a 
difference, reminding someone to vote will too. Make a call now. #votenov2. 
http://ht.ly/32BcY,” 2) referencing other social media “Tweet at us, how 
many voters did you talk to today? #KYDems #VoteNov2,” 3) providing 
information about campaign activities, “President Clinton is joining us this 
Monday at UofL at 5:00 PM make sure you join us! #votenov2” and “Get-
ting ready to go on Hardball with Chris Matthews, tune in 5pm EDT on MS-
NBC,” 4) requesting support through social media applications “Show your 
support for our campaign—make this your profile picture, and make sure 
your friends do the same!” 5) voting information and requests to vote “Are 
you registered to vote? Today is the last day to register before election day. 
http://wwwrockthevote.com/.” A link followed that explained the initiative. 
6) endorsements such as “Lexington Herald Leader endorses Jack Conway 
for U.S. Senate. http://bit.ly/9EIHo0.” The most characteristic feature of his 
Facebook posts was the ever-present Facebook profile name of “Jack Conway 
for Kentucky,” which seemed to give his posts a tired, bland, sameness qual-
ity. And, there were frequent postings accompanied with the same posed 
photograph of candidate Conway.

CONCLUSION
The role of social media in political campaigns continues to be significant, 
as was reflected in the 2010 midterm election. Further, the role of the Mil-
lennials continues to be significant when enthusiasm levels are elevated. 
Again, this was demonstrated in the 2010 midterm election. The thesis of 
this case study was that social media and the youth are a powerful combina-
tion for the twenty-first-century American political landscape. Although the 
youth vote was lower in 2010 than in 2008, the youth vote was still felt in 
the 2010 election. As has been documented, the Millennials are very reliant 
upon social media not just for day-to-day peer communication but also for 
their gathering of information about what is happening in their communi-
ties, nation, and the world. For the moment, this new generation has chosen 
social media as the avenue in which they voice their concerns and find 
like-minded individuals to champion causes. Particularly, this new genera-
tion believes strongly in and embraces the participatory aspects of social 
media. For example, in early 2010, The MacArthur Foundation’s Digital 
Media and Learning Initiative concluded, “While some scholars believe 
that engagement in such forms of participatory culture can eventually lead 
to engagement in participatory democracy, the researchers gathered at the 
Princeton convening acknowledged that the likelihood of this transition is 
far from clear” (Davis, 2010, para. 8).
The conclusion arrived at from this chapter’s case study was that in the 
California gubernatorial race there were indeed differences in strategies used 
by the two candidates. Jerry Brown appeared as a seasoned politician who 
was adept at using Twitter and Facebook. Frequently, his campaign cleverly 
referenced Twitter and other social media and even offered video lessons on 
how to utilize other social media. You could almost feel his excitement from 
reading his posts. Jerry Brown’s campaign used Twitter to provide quick 
and specific information bursts to his supporters. Retweet, TweetDeck, re-
ply, blogs, status updates, Tweet Button, and API Twitter were all used and 
promoted to communicate his agenda. Above all, Brown was not averse to 
attacking his opponent via social media. In fact, many times his Facebook 
posts and tweets would attack his opponent and state his position on the 
attack issue simultaneously. The impression of Brown’s social media was 
that of an upbeat, innovative, confident, excited, mature, and experienced 
campaigner. Conversely, Meg Whitman’s use of both Twitter and Facebook 
were very positive, primarily stayed away from issue oriented statements, and 
was generally not used effectively to promote the candidate or even attack her 
opponent. In many instances, Whitman would announce campaign stops after 
the event occurred whereas her opponent always promoted upcoming cam-
paign events and had links for times and directions. If social media helped

voters make a decision as to which candidate to support, then it explains Jerry 
Brown’s victory as California’s new governor.
Regarding the United States Senate race in Kentucky, the conclusion ar-
rived at from this chapter’s case study is that both candidates used Facebook 
and Twitter to propel attacks at each other without any hesitation. At least on 
Facebook and Twitter, it was a very negative campaign as this chapter did not 
examine political campaigning on traditional media outlets. Aside from the 
attacks, Jack Conway’s use of Facebook certainly included the various ap-
plications and his postings could be found in all the expected categories of en-
couraging voter participation and providing campaign event information. The 
impression, in general, was of an egocentric individual eager to make sure his 
campaign banner and his picture were prominent in most posts. As Twitter is 
designed to do in 140 characters or less, Jack Conway’s campaign utilized it to 
provide quick and specific information to his supporters. He tended to include 
more opponent attacks and some of the attacks were sharply critical including 
references to negative financial activities together with associations with white 
separatists, and even pornographers. Rand Paul, the Tea Party Republican can-
didate, was also guilty of negative campaign attacks against his opponent. In 
fact, between the two candidates, the majority of the posts and tweets included 
mudslinging. Unlike Jerry Brown with his clever video tutorials provided to 
supporters on how to use other social media and Meg Whitman’s clever usage 
of “Twibbons,” Facebook apps, and her mobile program on Facebook for mo-
bile texting to receive bumper stickers, all of which were available to her sup-
porters. Neither Rand Paul nor Jack Conway demonstrated any sophisticated 
use of Facebook or Twitter and the number of their friends and followers on 
these social media were low numbers. The case study provides little evidence 
that social media played a significant role in the Kentucky campaign.
Although strong evidence exists that social media are now a mandatory way 
to communicate with the electorate, it still requires the candidate’s usage of the 
technology to be effective and to have a positive impact. And, strong evidence 
does exist that supports the assertion that the Millennials will play a substantial 
role in future American politics. But, the need for further research in this area 
remains. In 2010, the MacArthur Foundation called for further research in this 
area, stating: “At the same time, we all recognized the need for additional re-
search to support and extend such recommendations, such as empirical research 
that explores the connection between participatory culture and participatory 
democracy. Further research will allow us to identify those aspects of youth’s 
digital media practices that follow common historical patterns of moral panic 
and those aspects that represent a true historical turning point. In the case of the 
former, we can look to history for insight and guidance. In the case of the latter, 
however, we will need to invent new strategies for supporting youth develop-
ment in this digital era” (Dav is, 2010, para. 14–15).

Chapter Twelve
Social Media and Youth Activism
Rhon Teruelle
In the 1960s, the student movement and the Black Panther party were two 
examples of youth-driven subcultural formations that were instrumental in 
helping actualize societal changes such as the end of the Vietnam war and 
the extension of civil rights to minority groups (Agger, 2009; Flacks, 1969; 
Gitlin, 1980). And in the 1970s, punk rock helped define youth subcultures 
enacting social change. Punks, dissatisfied with the status quo, established 
their own music, fashion, and lifestyle through a countercultural movement 
that challenged social norms (Hebdige, 1979; Laing, 1985; Marcus, 1989). 
Today, however, many critics think that youth are not only disengaged from 
civic participation, but are equally “self-centered, narcissistic, competitive, 
confident and individualistic” (Bryner, 2010). Thus, an increasingly pessi-
mistic attitude toward young people has become prevalent.
Contrary to this popular discourse, some suggest that “many young people 
have found their voices and are speaking up for change” (Ardizzone, 2005, 
para. 1). Others posit that countless youth are civically engaged and involved 
in movements outside traditional political groups such as trade unions and 
political parties. In a very concrete way, they see youth actively participating 
as social change agents (Chawla, 2002; Kennelly, 2009; Rizzini, 2010). But 
have online sites been effectively utilized by youth interested in changing 
the world? Is it even possible to do so? From the reworking of Pink Floyd’s 
anti-authoritarian anthem to “Ayatollah, Leave Those Kids Alone” as a rally-
ing cry for Iranians, to discussions about organizing a youth-led revolution, 
to a group determined to “kick apathy in the balls,” the answer appears to be 
a resounding “yes.” It also stands to reason that since youth spend countless 
hours on social media, these too should be primary tools for facilitating civic 
participation and activism. But is this reality or merely perception?

In an attempt to answer the aforementioned questions, this chapter ex-
plored the two most popular social media, Facebook and Twitter, as resources 
for youth activism. Their potentiality for civic engagement as activist groups 
and individuals was investigated. Young people discussed their perceptions 
of both activism (in general) and online activism (in particular). In sum, this 
chapter investigated the possibilities and limitations of social media in pro-
moting and facilitating youth activism.
CONTEMPORARY YOUTH ACTIVISM
Critics propose that young people’s apathy is symptomatic of their disen-
gagement; from social issues in general, and politics in particular. Many 
in the media have bemoaned the younger generation’s disengagement and 
their primary concern with their own well-being coupled with their laziness, 
ignorance, and narcissism (Borba, 2010; Norman, 2006; Page, 2010). The 
reasons factored into this perceived disengagement include distrust of those 
in power, a sense of entitlement, and arrogance, just to name a few. For far 
too many, young people’s attitudes are a mere precursor to the erosion of 
society (Houston, 2010).
Despite the negativity, perhaps not all is lost. For one, Banet-Weiser (2004) 
claims that the world is being transformed by young people, “but crucially 
through means and methods that are unfamiliar to adults” (p. 282). The youth 
of today are challenging tradition and engaging in activist practices that either 
go unnoticed or are disregarded as non-activism when applying the old staid 
terms: technological advancement has necessitated a new way of understand-
ing activism among young people. Contemporary research reflects this line 
of thinking as concepts such as “networked activism” (Best, 2005), “alter-ac-
tivism” (Juris & Pleyers, 2009), and “subactivism” (Bakardjieva, 2009) have 
come to the forefront, while Banaji and Buckingham (2009) position “ethical 
consumerism” as another new form of activism. What all these theories share 
in common are respective re-conceptualizations of youth activism today.
Working on the same premise, Dahlgren (2010) proposes a radical leap 
from conventional thinking: a political position consisting of purposeful 
activism through willful disengagement. Dahlgren maintains that “we must 
build into the notion of engagement not just a bias toward democracy but 
some irreducible element of free will” (p. 9). By definition, engagement is 
the act of doing. But Dahlgren argues that engagement is also the act of “not 
doing” when the element of free will is introduced. In short, willfully choos-
ing not to engage is engagement in itself when it is an individual’s choice.

Social Media and Youth Activism 
203
Among many that demand a rethinking of citizenship and democracy, Juris 
and Pleyers (2009) articulate a new form of activism: namely, alter-activism. 
Alter-activism “expands on many features associated with past youth move-
ments” (p. 57) and is explained as representing “an alternative form of 
democratic participation, which is at once cultural and political, a new mode 
of global citizenship, and an emerging form of transnational (sub-)cultural 
practice” (p. 60). Alter-activism is both an activist culture, “a particular way 
of understanding and working toward social change” and a youth culture that 
is “a shared way of experiencing the world, building common identities and 
lifestyles, and interacting with others beyond or within the ‘interstitial’ spaces 
of institutional life” (p. 63). Alter-activists use today’s technology as a tool 
for their activism and “primarily use email and electronic listserves” while 
also creating “temporary web pages during mobilizations to provide informa-
tion, resources, and contact lists, and post documents and calls to action, as 
well as house discussion forums and Internet relay chat rooms” (p. 67). They 
have been known to create and circulate alternative news and information, 
and practice “tactical media” in the form of culture jamming and “new kinds 
of electronic civil disobedience, such as the ‘virtual sit-in’” (p. 67). If viewed 
through the traditional lens of what constitutes activism, then alter-activism 
would not be considered a form of activism at all because the actions do not 
conform to tradition.
Most egregiously, the discourse surrounding youth apathy and disengage-
ment is overstated. Studies indicate that young people worldwide are not 
as apathetic and disengaged as the media would have us believe (Atkinson, 
2009; Hoffman & Appiah, 2010; Hardina, 2010; Scammel, 2000). Juris and 
Pleyers (2009) maintain the following: “analyses that equate a lack of formal 
participation with apathy mistakenly blame young people for this situation 
and overlook alternative forms of political engagement” (p. 60). More pos-
sibilities exist in our non-binary world.
SIMILARITIES TO THE 1960S MOVEMENT
Despite its many forms, the most predominant media images of youth activ-
ism are those of protests and demonstrations. Historically, this mirrors the 
widespread media coverage of the student protests of the 1960s and early 
1970s. Hence, in the minds of many, youth activism only occurs when it is 
in the form of a visible action. And aside from the number of recent media 
reports detailing the student uprising in Europe, by and large, youth activism 
has gone relatively unnoticed by the general public due to minimal media

Rhon Teruelle
coverage. Of course, there have been a few exceptions to this: from a North 
American context, Barack Obama’s “Facebook election” and the recent G20 
protests in Toronto, Canada, are prime examples of youth activism that have 
garnered great media attention, for a variety of reasons. However, even those 
media reports pale in comparison to the coverage of the student activism in 
the 1960s. And it is because of this media effect that a number of individuals 
still believe that youth activism reached its apex during the 1960s and the 
early 1970s.
From an historical perspective (Agger, 2009; Westby 1976), to their own 
personal experience (Gurvis, 2006; McEvoy & Miller, 1969), to an analyti-
cal assessment (Gitlin, 1980; Phillips 1980; Sherkat & Blocker, 1994, 1997; 
Wood 1975), countless individuals have written on and about the student 
movement of the 1960s. Despite the topical and stylistic differences between 
the works, what cannot be disputed is that each author credits the student 
movement as having played a large role in helping to facilitate drastic 
changes within society. Aside from their obvious link to the anti–Vietnam 
War movement, the students were also heavily involved in social justice for 
the civil rights movement, the women’s liberation movement, and gay rights, 
as well as environmental issues and freedom of speech, among other things.
Essentially, the commonality between the student activists of the 1960s 
and 1970s and today’s young activists is twofold. Just as the student activists 
from the 1960s were concerned with issues that had a direct (negative) effect 
on their lives, so are today’s young activists. And just as their predecessors 
had used the media available to them to further their cause, so too do today’s 
young activists. Naturally, activism has evolved insofar as it now incorpo-
rates and takes advantage of modern technology and current media forma-
tions; in particular, social media.
INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA
Although the exponential growth of the Internet in conjunction with the tre-
mendous success of social media is no longer debated, researchers remain 
polarized by the ongoing discussions pertaining to the potential of the Internet 
in actualizing social change. Sceptics who do not ascribe to the possibility of 
the Internet in actualizing social change draw their conclusions from a num-
ber of studies (Baumgartner & Morris, 2009; Grossman 2004). Others instead 
point out that the effect of the Internet on civic participation and political 
engagement is highly dependant on the individuals themselves, although 
the opportunities for engagement are present (Banaji & Buckingham, 2010; 
Zhang, Johnson, Seltzer, & Bichard, 2010). There are clearly many examples

Social Media and Youth Activism 
205
of those who doubt that the Internet can facilitate meaningful activism, let 
alone social change.
In another vein, there are a growing number of studies that oppose the 
above claims. Their results suggest that the potential of current technologies 
and specifically, social media, are being effectively utilized by young activ-
ists who are formalizing new modes of activism (Bachen, Raphael, Lynn, 
McKee, & Phillippi, 2008; Delli Carpini 2000; Harris & Wyn, 2009; Juris 
& Pleyers 2009). These critics, besides being more hopeful, firmly believe 
in the Internet and social media’s potential to bring about social change, and 
subscribe to nontraditional forms of youth activism.
In fact, what has emerged for Wilson (2006) is that this “new” virtual world 
should not be differentiated from the “real” world. According to Wilson, for 
young people (and countless adults nowadays), the virtual is as real as offline 
relationships and experiences (p. 316). Thus, it stands to reason that since off-
line and online “realities” have become intrinsically intertwined, a disconnect 
no longer exists between the two. And as Valenzuela, Park, and Kee (2009) 
postulate, “The development of SNSs dedicated to fostering civil and political 
engagement among users, particularly young people, speaks in a loud voice to 
the potentialities of social media as a tool for collective action” (p. 879). Hence, 
in order to precipitate meaningful changes in today’s world, young people’s use 
of social media must play a large part in actualizing those changes.
METHODS
The central question of the study was to investigate the potentiality and 
limitations of social media in facilitating youth activism. Data were collected 
by examining five of the more popular Facebook youth activism groups (10 
Million Strong Against the British National Party (BNP) (UK), Democratic 
Socialists of America—Young Democratic Socialists (US), Students Against 
Tuition Fees Rising Again (UK), The New Movement Forging New Peace 
in Equal Rights and Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transsexuals and Queers 
(GLBTQ) Activism (US), and Activists Networking Against the Exploitation 
of Children (SA). The five groups were selected to represent a variety of is-
sues that concern young activists: democracy; rising tuition fees; equal rights 
for GLBTQ; and exploitation of children. As well, the five groups were fairly 
representative of Western dominance on social media; two groups were from 
the United States and two were from the United Kingdom. The non-Western 
group was based in South Africa. Also, groups that contained a large mem-
bership (over 400 members) and maintained transparency, in the form of 
content open to the public, were specifically targeted.

For this study, five individuals/groups on Twitter (YAHAnet, Brutalcops 
UK, think 2050, seachele420, Freechild Project) and 40 young people were 
surveyed to determine their views on youth activism in relation to social me-
dia. Although the Facebook groups and the individuals and groups on Twitter 
are not representative of all youth activists, they do demonstrate how social 
media are currently being used in conjunction with activism by young people.
And in order to develop a more nuanced study that deals with young people, 
activism, and social media, it is imperative to gain a general understanding of 
what young people’s thoughts are on the subject. To satisfy this, a question-
naire was administered to 40 participants ranging in age from 18 to 29. These 
individuals, who remained anonymous for obvious reasons, volunteered 
to participate in the study, and their responses were quite revealing. The 
questionnaire itself was fashioned with questions that reflected Likert items, 
as respondents were able to choose their answers from 5 distinct choices: 
strongly disagree; agree; neither agree nor disagree; agree; strongly agree. 
Since the questionnaire was exploratory in nature, the questions posed were 
fairly simple to comprehend and specific to youth activism, as evidenced by 
the following examples: 1) Are you currently involved in any type of activ-
ism (e.g., a group that is trying to bring about changes in the world—be it 
ecological, social, political, etc.)? 2) Do you feel that activism is effective and 
can bring about change?, and 3) Do you feel that online activism is effective? 
Essentially, this exploratory questionnaire provided a general overview of 
how young people felt about youth activism online, in addition to identifying 
those who are active participants in youth activism.
As a follow-up to the questionnaire, 10 semi-structured interviews were 
conducted with those identified as being most actively involved in civic and 
political participation to gain even further insight into young activists today. 
These interviews were conducted on a “one-on-one” basis with all the par-
ticipants. The questions posed were open-ended and allowed the participants 
to lead the conversation. Effectively, the semi-structured interview questions 
allowed the subjects to elaborate on their previous responses found in the 
questionnaire, as the five-level Likert item was no longer utilized, and the 
responses were free-flowing. For example, a typical question was thus: You 
previously mentioned that online activism was effective. What has led you to 
this conclusion? And typical follow-up questions included the following: 1) 
What type of things can impact the effectiveness of online activism? 2) Do 
you think that there are limitations to how social media can help facilitate 
youth activism? If so, what are these limitations? Although there were a few 
questions that were prepared for the semi-structured interview beforehand, 
typically, the follow-up questions were unscripted and were used as a way 
to further explore the participants’ beliefs and attitudes about activism in

general, and online activism in particular. In short, these interviews provided 
further insight into young people’s motivation and goals for activism, as well 
as identifying the online resources that they frequented, valued, and trusted.
The decision to definitively position those between the ages of 18 to 29 as 
young people was a conscious choice. To be more precise, the young people 
who participated in the study belong to a demographic that is more likely to 
be involved in activism. Mainly because it is a social construct, the definition 
of young people is always in constant flux. Flanagan and Syvertsen (2006) 
define youth as the following:
Youth is an elastic category: where it begins and ends is subject to interpreta-
tion and is sensitive to social and historical context. Typically, this stage or time 
in the life cycle refers to persons in the adolescent and emerging adult years, 
people who are no longer children but “not quite” adults in the sense of assum-
ing the independence and responsibilities typically associated with adulthood. 
Depending on the socioeconomic and sociocultural traditions of a society, youth 
may be persons as young as thirteen and as old as forty. (p. 11)
Hence, in defining young people, this research ascribes to this definition but 
limits its participants to those who are of legal age but under 30.
FACEBOOK FINDINGS
The results clearly suggest that although Facebook’s potential to connect 
young activists is tremendous, sustaining a young person’s interest in a group 
and in a cause is a bit more challenging. Two of the five groups, the Demo-
cratic Socialists of America (US) and Students Against Tuition Fees Rising 
Again (UK), remain active as displayed by the recent postings by its members 
(see table 12.1). However, the other three groups (10 Million Strong Against 
the BNP [UK], The New Movement Forging New Peace in Equal Rights and 
GLBTQ Activism [US], and Activists Networking Against the Exploitation 
of Children [SA] range in activity from being somewhat active to inactive.
To give further context into the possible reasons for inactivity, the group 
(10 Million Strong against the BNP) has 22,204 members. The BNP is a 
right-wing political party that is recognized for restricting its membership to 
people it referred to as “indigenous Caucasian.” The majority of the “wall 
posts” on the page chastise the BNP as a racist party. Additionally, numer-
ous members’ call for action centers around fighting racism. Despite its large 
membership, it is no longer an active group as indicated by the last posting, 
which was on November 16, 2010, and only four posts have been made in 
the past three months. Quite possibly, 10 Million Strong Against the BNP’s

members could have contributed to keeping the party out of power during the 
recent 2010 UK elections. However, while the 10 Million Strong Facebook 
group is now relatively inactive, the BNP still exists.
In the same vein, the recent tuition hikes in the UK is a current issue, which 
is reflected by the traffic found on the Students Against Tuition Fees Rising 
Again group page. The protests, sit-ins, and rallies are ongoing, which coin-
cides with the number of current posts on the website. It remains a very active 
group with many of its members involved in the student protests taking place 
on many university campuses across the UK. Several of the posts relate to in-
formation regarding planned protests and campaigns against the tuition hikes, 
links to the issues involved, links to political parties, and links to videos of the 
protests. The last post was dated December 10, 2010, and there have been 27 
posts in the past three months. Since the tuition hikes have become a reality, 
will the members continue to oppose it or begrudgingly accept it in the end? 
Undoubtedly, the traffic on the site will be indicative of the young people’s 
reactions toward the situation.
And whereas The Democratic Socialists of America remains an active 
group, the same cannot be said for both The New Movement Forging New 
Peace in Equal Rights—GLBTQ and Activists Networking Against the 
Exploitation of Children. Many members of The Democratic Socialists of 
America are explicit in their calls for action and post on the site on topics that 
include the following: 1) information on conferences and rallies; 2) regional 
factions that seek membership; 3) individuals seeking out local groups; 4) in-
dividuals attempting to start their own group; and, 5) supporting ideology and 
links to like-minded articles, webpages, and blogs. On the other hand, The 
New Movement Forging New Peace in Equal Rights—GLBTQ has remained 
inactive for several months despite its fairly large membership. And based 
in South Africa, Activists Networking Against the Exploitation of Children 
has had three posts recorded in the past three months, and none of them were 
explicit calls for action.
TWITTER FINDINGS
“Tweets” (messages sent) and “re-tweets” (re-sending messages made by 
other posters) far outnumber posts made on Facebook pages (see table 12.2). 
Moreover, unlike the Facebook groups, individual members of Twitter tend 
to be more diverse in the number of issues they address. A prime example 
of this is seachele420, who has tweeted and re-tweeted 634 times in the past 
week alone. The topics discussed include the following: 1) the oil spill in 
the Gulf of Mexico; 2) Green Peace and animal activists; 3) WikiLeaks and

owner/activist Julian Assange; 4) various environmental issues; and, 5) net 
neutrality. Similarly, brutalcopsUK has tweeted and re-tweeted 179 times in 
the past week. While the common underlying theme behind all his tweets 
and re-tweets deal with perceived police brutality, there are also tweets that 
engage with the student protests, practical tools for activism, the BBC, and 
the government, as well as links to photos and videos of police attacks.
On the other side, groups on Twitter function in a similar way as those on 
Facebook as the majority of the tweets and re-tweets on their respective sites 
deal primarily with one particular issue: YAHAnet deals with AIDS, AIDS 
awareness, and HIV-related material, information, groups, and calls for ac-
tion; think2050 proposes bringing intergenerational equity to the heart of 
decision-making; the Freechild Project promotes youth voice, youth engage-
ment, and youth activism. For example, one such call for action by YAHAnet 
is a request for support to “Mary’s FACE AIDS Back to School Project” 
which involves funding to help give HIV-infected students from the Kirehe 
and Kayonza districts of Rwanda the opportunity to attend secondary school. 
Meanwhile, the Freechild Project has recently challenged youth by asking, 
“What are YOU doing to change the world right now?” Included in this tweet 
is a link to the group’s website; specifically, the Youth Action Resource Cen-
tre, which helps and directs youth interested in activism.
To summarize, individuals and groups on Twitter are much more active 
compared to their Facebook counterparts in terms of online posting. More-
over, all those sampled displayed a very active online presence. However, 
this does not necessarily translate to effective activism, not unless tweeting 
or posting something online is considered activism in itself. Essentially, de-
termining effective activism through Twitter requires further analysis.
FINDINGS FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND INTERVIEWS
The results from the questionnaires, as displayed in table 12.3, indicate that 
quite a large percentage (32.5%) of the respondents believe themselves to be 
involved in some form of activism. Despite this number, a staggering percent-
age (95%) believe that activism can lead to social change. The fact that only 
(5%) of the respondents do not believe in the effectiveness of activism in 
bringing about positive changes to society speaks volumes. These results seem 
to support Dahlgren’s (2010) and Brlek-Slasek and Turnsek’s (2010) claims 
that young people today feel completely powerless to actualize change. If such 
an overwhelming majority believe that activism can bring about change, why 
are more of them not involved? Or phrased as a question: If you truly believe 
that activism can bring about change, then why are you not involved yourself?

The majority of the respondents were familiar with various types of online 
activism (80%), and individual activists as well as activist groups on both 
Facebook (75%) and Twitter (75%). A large number (77.5%) also feel that 
online activism is effective. However, there remains a strong disconnect 
between their awareness and action, as a paltry number of the respondents 
belonged to a Facebook activist group (12.5%), and an even lesser number 
(7.5%) were involved with activists on Twitter. Another important statistic 
that bears mentioning is that although 32.5% of the respondents claim to be 
involved in activism or an activist group, 40% consider themselves activists. 
This result suggests that 7.5% of those polled still view themselves as activ-
ists despite not being currently involved in any activism or group.
The additional semi-structured interviews conducted with 10 of the most 
actively involved respondents further clarifies how young people perceive 
youth activism. According to participant 1, an undergraduate, her reason 
for remaining involved in activism is due to the fact that “it feels right.” On 
a similar note, participant 2, also an undergraduate, is involved in activism 
because the causes she supports mirrors her values and beliefs.
A recurring theme for these young activists is the idea that even with their 
individual contributions, they were making a difference. Or as participant 3 
rationalizes, she not only tries to live her life as environmentally friendly as 
possible, but also tries to convince others to do the same. In a similar fashion, 
participant 4 sees herself as a “daily activist” who purposefully chooses envi-
ronmentally friendly modes of transportation. And despite identifying herself 
as a “passive activist,” participant 5 nevertheless displays characteristics that 
are inherent in activism. Participants 6, 7, 8, and 9 all professed to be highly 
involved in activism and utilized various forms of social media to enact their 
participation.
And reflective of his belief in the effectiveness of activism in general, and 
online activism in particular, participant 10 posits that the Internet and social

Social Media and Youth Activism

media are well on their way to becoming an effective tool for activists. Such 
logic is in line with young contemporary activists’ realities. Since the majority 
of Western youth spend a great portion of their waking hours online, as Boyd 
(2007) and Livingstone and Bober (2004) have alluded to, it stands to reason 
that young people conceive the Internet—and, by extension, social media—as 
limitless in its possibilities; especially when it pertains to facilitating social 
change. However, although they believe in the Internet’s possibilities, it does 
not necessarily translate into action, as only a few young people take advantage 
of the opportunities for them to participate (Livingstone, 2007).
CONCLUSION
This chapter’s findings have revealed that many young people are currently 
involved in activism. As evidenced by some of the participants’ responses 
to the questionnaire, today’s young people use social media to enact their 
activism. However, obstacles such as the prevalent mythology that positions 
youth as disengaged quickly needs to be disproven. And although increasing, 
the literature exploring youth activism online is somewhat minimal especially 
when compared to other studies involving youth. This poses a challenge, but 
is to be expected for a relatively new and evolving topic.
The sample groups chosen from Facebook and Twitter are indicative of 
both the possibilities and limitations of youth activism on social media. 
Young people are definitively taking advantage of social media to facilitate 
youth activism, but the effectiveness of these actions are not as explicit. From 
the two sample groups chosen, those on Twitter tend to be more active online 
in comparison to their Facebook counterparts. Regardless, countless causes 
can be supported through both mediums, and both can and have been used 
to organize young activists. With this in mind, limitless possibilities exist in 
our networked society. Perhaps, in the not-so-distant future, these sites and 
others like it can be utilized in an even more efficient manner to ensure even 
more positive social changes.
Young people engaged in online activism cannot be counted on to solve 
all of the world’s problems or cure all social ills. However, history has 
shown that due, in large part, to youth activism, some societal changes can 
be achieved. This chapter explored youth activism using social media with 
the goal of gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon, critiquing the 
current movements, and ultimately, increasing ways of getting more young 
people involved in activism.
Recent scholarship into youth activism reveals that this subject requires 
more attention. Calls for future research into the topic include “untangling

these different influences on the ways young people develop as citizens re-
mains an important area for future research” (Kennedy, 2010, p. 322). More-
over, a similar need exists in studying youth activism using social media:
Although prior research indicates that Internet information-seeking is associated 
with building young people’s political knowledge, interest, trust, participation in 
voluntary organizations, and community service, we still know little about what 
kinds of Web sites are most effective at fostering these connections. (Bachen et 
al., 2008, p. 293)
This chapter helps attend to the need for increased scholarship into new 
manifestations of youth activism by beginning an exploration into the effec-
tiveness of social media in promoting and facilitating youth activism online. 
As a response to the negativity surrounding today’s youth, it is imperative 
to challenge existing tropes and discourses, and instead reveal that today’s 
young people are not as disaffected and disengaged as many would have us 
believe. They do care and are using the technologies at their disposal to help 
achieve their goals. Moreover, the possibilities of social media in promoting 
and facilitating social change are limited only by the constraints of our col-
lective imaginations.

Chapter Thirteen
Black Youth, Social Media, 
and the 2008 Presidential Election
Travis L. Gosa
While scholars have focused on the digital divide between blacks and whites, 
and the poor and the affluent (Judge, Puckett & Bell, 2006; Kress, 2008), 
new research suggests that African American youth with Internet access 
are not contributing to online communities (Jackson, 2008). Young African 
American males exhibit the lowest levels of computer and Internet use of any 
subgroup while being engaged in high rates of video game play (Jackson, 
Zhao, Kolenic, Fitzgerald, Harold & Van Eye, 2008). This participation gap 
may represent the racialization and gendering of inequality in the YouTube 
era, as the virtual world is inextricably linked to real world (dis)advantage 
(Mossberger, Tolbert & Stansbury, 2003). The question of digital inequality 
in new media competency and participation is gaining needed attention (Har-
gittai, 2008; Hargittai & Walejko, 2008; Jenkins, Clinton, Purushotma, Ravi, 
Alice & Weigel, 2009).
Social media participation represents an avenue for the development 
of skills or human capital required for success in information economies 
(Jenkins et al., 2009). As sociologist Conley (2009) explained, new media 
represent a valuable conduit of social capital, as virtual trust and web-based 
knowledge increasingly define society’s haves and have-nots. Wikis, blogs, 
and YouTube also represent an emerging source of political capital in the age 
of digital democracy. In the American context, the 2008 presidential election 
was the first in which political participation and civic engagement moved to 
digital, online communities (Muir, 2008).
The use of social media in the 2008 presidential election provides a case 
study for examining these issues related to the participation gap. During 
the candidacy and election of Barack Hussein Obama as the first African

American president, black youth flooded YouTube and Peer-2-Peer (P2P) 
file-sharing sites with Obama-inspired dances (e.g., “The Obama Hustle”), 
video mashups (“Crank Dat Obama”), and impromptu rap songs (“Obam-
A-Milli”). A qualitative analysis of the election was used to explain how 
and why African American/male youth were poised to become active agents 
in this online movement. It is argued that the race-gender connection with 
Obama and the cultural capital embedded in the popular culture of hip hop led 
black youth to engage social media. While young African American males 
suffer from many historical socioeconomic disadvantages, the “Obama ef-
fect” allowed for the widespread visibility of this group on the Internet.
Advocates of social media tend to emphasize the revolutionary nature of 
user-generated media to flatten social relationships and to decentralize ex-
pertise. Critics of social media warn about the tragedy of the mob, and the 
emptiness of the digital world (Gladwell, 2010; Keen, 2007). The narrative 
of the 2008 election provides some cautionary tales about the limits of online 
activism due to possible corporate misuse and a heavy reliance on popular 
culture entertainment. The overall objective of this chapter was to examine 
how shifting race-gender dynamics in the Obama moment created challenges 
and possibilities for African American/male participation.
NEW MEDIA PERSISTENT INEQUITIES
The work of French sociologist Bourdieu (1977/1986) provides a context 
for understanding the relationship between social stratification and new me-
dia technology. While elites always attempt to dominate valued resources 
and skills which Bourdieu calls “capitals,” he stresses that the outcome of 
contests is not predetermined. Moments of cultural and social reproduction 
depend on the context of ever-changing institutional realities which he calls 
“fields.” Importantly, society’s winners and losers can shift in “social worlds 
where practices are only weakly institutionalized and boundaries are not well 
established” (Swartz, 1997, p. 120).
New advances in personal computing and Internet technologies repre-
sent this kind of weak institutional field, in which contests over cultural, 
economic, and political capital are now taking place. However, the social 
media revolution of Twitter and YouTube has been built on the foundation of 
real-world exploitation of capital, opportunity hoarding, and monopolization 
(Hargittai, 2008; Mossberger et al., 2003). The “information superhighway” 
promised to usher all Americans into a new era of prosperity and freedom. 
Historically, though, the superhighway has been an expensive and exclusive 
toll road. Since the early 1990s emergence of chat rooms on Compuserve and

America Online, researchers have described a digital divide along persistent 
nodes of (dis)advantage. Access to these online spaces has always varied 
along intersecting social matrices: socioeconomics (poor/rich), race (black/
white), geography (urban/rural), gender (male/female), and age (young/old) 
(Judge et al., 2006; Kress, 2008; Mossberger et al., 2003).
The digital field has shifted dramatically in the last twenty years, as the 
economic barriers to connectedness have receded and high-speed access has 
become commonplace. In 2000, only 3% of American households had high-
speed, broadband Internet (one million bytes per second or faster). Today, 
two-thirds of American households subscribe to broadband Internet, at an 
average cost of $40 per month for unlimited access (Smith, 2010).
Despite the lessening of exclusion, recent numbers on Internet connectivity 
demonstrate a shrinking, though significant digital divide along socio-demo-
graphics. In 2010, 67% of whites and 56% of African Americans were broad-
band users (an 11-point gap). The relative gaps along education (53-point gap 
between high school dropouts and college educated), income level (42-point 
gap between poor and affluent), and geography (20-point gap between urban 
and rural) remain large (Smith, 2010). Internet access has become faster, 
cheaper, and less scarce in a relatively short period of time, though differ-
ences remain. As the original digital divide continues to shrink, computer and 
Internet technologies in everyday life are quickly becoming natural. While 
some Americans still lack access to the Internet, the propagation of free 
public Wi-Fi hotspots at libraries, coffee shops, schools, and town localities 
means that basic connectivity is becoming as common as FM/AM radio. The 
field of digital inequality is now shifting from online access to participation.
SOCIAL MEDIA AND PARTICIPATORY CULTURE
The spread of always-on, near-ubiquitous Internet connectivity and relatively 
low-cost computer technology has spurred the social media revolution. Often 
referred to as “Web 2.0,” the moniker suggests a movement toward Internet-
based applications that emphasize user-generated content and interaction. 
Social media represent a weakening of institutionalized boundaries of au-
thority. They blur the traditional lines between producer and consumer, artist 
and audience, as culture and meaning are constantly (re)produced through 
instant communication through social networks (Conley, 2009). The lone 
amateur, when joined by the “crowd” or “mob,” can dictate credibility, trust, 
or authentic coolness (Surowiecki, 2004). Observers have deemed this shift 
revolutionary because “everybody” (or “anyone”) can become a media pow-
erhouse, news reporter, rapper, editor, and activist (Shirky, 2008). A positive

interpretation holds that social media solved the problem of scarcity, oppor-
tunity hoarding, and exclusion by powerful business elites.
The accolades for social media must be tempered by the sober realization 
that the dimension of online inequity may have shifted from digital access to 
digital participation. The participation gap denotes the unequal opportunity 
to experience, create, and share self-generated media online. For example, 
participation can entail uploading self-published “zines” (magazines or short 
stories) or mashups of the new Jay-Z song with The Beatles b-sides. A ma-
jority of teens with Internet access seem to love creating blogs or sharing 
photography online. Research by the Pew Internet & American Life Project 
suggests that more than half of teenagers (age 13–18) are new media creators. 
At least one-fifth of young people report “remixing” the content they find on-
line (Lenhart & Madden, 2005). The importance of anonymity on the Internet 
makes research on social media use and behavior difficult to detangle, but 
self-reported assessments through survey research provide some estimates of 
online participation.
Notwithstanding rampant downloading of copyrighted music, “sexting” 
(sending sexy messages), or cyber-bullying, these practices help equip youth 
with valuable critical thinking skills. A comprehensive report by the Mac-
Authur Foundation summarizes the importance of online participatory culture 
in the 21st century (Clinton et al., 2006):
The potential benefits of these forms of participatory culture include opportuni-
ties for peer-to-peer learning, a changed attitude toward intellectual property, 
the diversification of cultural expression, the development of skills valued in the 
modern workplace, and a more empowered conception of citizenship. Access 
to this participatory culture functions as a new form of the hidden curriculum, 
shaping which youth will succeed and which will be left behind as they enter 
school and the workplace. (p. 3)
We imagine that all youth are now “growing up digital” (Heverly, 2007, 
p. 199). However, research shows that some youth with access are not utiliz-
ing social media technologies. Even when access is not an issue, differences 
have been documented in the intensity and types of technologies used by 
race, gender, and social class. The ability to participate in these new spaces 
is likely tied to old mechanisms of inequality in home life, educational 
background, and economic resources. This is what Hargittai (2008) calls the 
“digital reproduction of inequality” (p. 936). Hargittai and Walejko (2008), 
for example, find significant socioeconomic and racial differences in college 
students’ participation in new media. African American college students are 
less likely than other racial groups to create photography or films online, 
while white, middle-class (as measured by parental education) students are

more likely to produce music and videos online. This gap represents a missed 
opportunity for some African American youth to practice computer skills, 
influence online discourse, and receive meaningful feedback from peers. 
Among adolescents of middle-school age, whites are more likely than blacks 
to use computer and Internet technologies for communication and entertain-
ment (Jackson et. al, 2008). These racial gaps are compounded by gender. 
Girls of all races are more likely to use the Internet for communications and 
practical research, such as googling health issues or cooking advice, rather 
than just fun (Wasserman & Richmond-Abott, 2005).
This places young African American males at the intersecting disadvan-
tage of race, class, and gender. The subgroup exhibits the lowest levels of 
computer and Internet use of any subgroup (Jackson et al., 2008). And much 
to the dismay of parents, black adolescents—like males of all races—spend 
more of their online time browsing sexually explicit materials than do girls 
(Peter & Valkenburg, 2006). Young African American males evidence high 
rates of video game play, a troubling trend given the link to aggressive be-
havior, low academic achievement, and health problems among adolescents 
(Anderson, Gentile, & Buckley, 2007). Black males’ engagement with video 
game technology represents the linking of real world problems with digital 
ones. Young African American males are especially at risk of developing low 
levels of school achievement and experience negative involvement with the 
criminal justice system. Thus, for this subgroup in particular, the opportunity 
to express one’s self and develop creative skills online takes on a heightened 
level of importance.
DIGITAL DEMOCRACY
Any participation gap is disheartening because all youth should engage new 
technology and global communications. As a realm of creativity and free ex-
pression, new media represents an opportunity to become active participants 
in media, not just passive recipients of popular culture products. In addition, 
these online spaces are becoming more than sites of cultural expression and 
entertainment; they represent meaningful sites of political discourse, orga-
nization, and political capital. Not participating in social media may mean 
exclusion from “online politics” or “digital democracy” (Muir, 2008).
The 2008 presidential election was the first in which political participa-
tion and civic engagement moved to digital, online communities (Hendricks 
& Denton, 2010). Wikis, blogs, text messages, and YouTube are becoming a 
valuable source of political capital for campaigns and individual citizens. The 
Internet allows for a particularly bi-directional campaign. Voters can talk back

to campaign staffs and become virtual campaigners through their online foot-
prints on social networking services. Conversely, these same networks can be 
used to instantly organize against rivals. The campaign of Barack Obama and 
Joe Biden leveraged text messages and Facebook to connect with youth voters, 
who traditionally evidence low levels of political involvement. Post-election 
analysis of Obama’s social media advantage shows how political capital can 
be produced through online social networks. Lutz (2009) calculates that the 
Obama campaign “friended” more than five million people on fifteen social 
networking sites and uploaded at least 2,000 official videos to YouTube. By 
Lutz’s count, these videos were viewed more than 80 million times. The mag-
nitude of the online campaign created a new type of social movement in which 
its adherents were told to click web links and forward text messages to friends.
While the Obama campaign invested millions into online campaign staff-
ers and database software to manage email and text messages, the top-down 
branding of the election was dwarfed by organic, user-generated social me-
dia. During the election year, Obama supporters uploaded more than 442,000 
user-generated videos on YouTube alone (Hartman, 2008). Anyone with a 
cell phone or webcam could broadcast themselves singing, yelling, or ranting 
about election-year politics. It also created a unique opportunity for young, 
African American males. As this study describes, the production and distri-
bution of Obama songs, mashup videos, and dances is one example of black 
youth making their voices heard through social media.
METHOD
To examine issues related to digital reproduction of race-gender inequal-
ity in participatory online spaces, a qualitative case study of black youth’s 
social media usage was conducted. The overall goal was to examine how 
shifting race-gender dynamics in the Obama moment created challenges and 
possibilities for black/male participation. This study utilized an exploratory, 
“snowball” sampling approach to locate examples of black male youth’s on-
line media creations during the 2008 presidential election. Targeted keyword 
searches on “Obama,” “election,” and other political phrases were conducted 
from November 2009 through February 2010. Politically themed postings, 
songs, and videos were located via Peer-2-Peer trackers, search engines, 
social networking sites such as MySpace and YouTube, blogs, and mixtape 
websites such as DatPiff. The initial discovery of materials led to additional 
interlinked websites, videos, and message boards about the election.
Rather than provide an exhaustive count of the media produced and cir-
culated on the Internet, the approach was to identify thematic patterns in

black youth’s online contributions. For this study, more than 100 full-length, 
“mixtape” soundtracks dedicated to Obama, 600 unique Obama rap songs, 
and twenty YouTube videos with more than 10 million hits (as of Febru-
ary 2010)—all produced by black youth—were examined (Gosa, 2010). 
While these materials represented only a small, nonrandom sample of the 
massive ecosphere of content found on social media websites, it provided 
some insight into the types of self-made media created and circulated by 
African American youth since the 2008 election. Importantly, this approach 
revealed how the convergence of physical image, symbolic identity, and 
popular culture advantage—what might be called an “Obama effect” in social 
media—allowed black youth to actively participate in the creation of social 
media content during the election. Indeed, even when black youth were not 
the direct performers or producers of this material, their styles, sounds, and 
culture became inseparable from the online discourse.
REMIXING OBAMA: POP CULTURE 
MIXTAPES & RAPPING THE VOTE
The 2008 presidential election represented a new moment in which black, 
male youth processed valuable capitals that could be used to take a leading 
role in the online political discourse. The analysis revealed that three re-
sources dealing with physical image, symbolic identity, and popular culture 
converged to advantage black youth as “digital natives” instead of “digital 
immigrants” or outsiders. First, black males could appear as Obama, given 
the physicality of black-maleness. Young African American males could 
participate in the political discourse by appearing in Obama spoofs and re-
produce his mannerisms in online videos. Second, Obama’s black masculin-
ity provided a cultural frame of reference in which young African American 
males could claim legitimate authority over the meaning and importance of 
an Obama presidency. The notion of ownership and racial pride proved to be 
an important motive for logging on and getting involved. The third advantage 
for participation involved the pop culture branding of civil engagement in the 
2008 presidential election. In this context, black youth could use their hip hop 
coolness, fashion, music, and dance to impact political discourse.
These three dynamics of black/male youth’s participation can be seen in the 
production and distribution of user-generated compilations known as “mix-
tapes.” Musical mixtape culture extends back to the trading of cassette tapes 
through hand-to-hand contact in the 1980s. In today’s social media era, the 
digital mixtape consists of packaged (usually compressed or “zipped”) musi-
cal tracks, music videos, hyperlinks, sampled news clips, and photographs

and other artwork. Given the large amount of online campaigning and popular 
culture material surrounding the election, user-generated compilations allowed 
for the aggregation of these materials from around the web. Mixtape creators 
functioned as multimedia editors by using technologies to instantaneously re-
mix campaign advertisements, news interviews, and speeches with the hottest 
club beats to create a new political soundtrack. Black youth, already familiar 
with this format by way of hip hop culture, used these mixtapes to become ac-
tive participants in digital democracy.
The digital mixtape became an important aspect of participatory online 
culture for black youth during the presidential election due to the hip hop 
branding of the Obama campaign. Young African American males began 
circulating music about Obama in the fall of 2007, after Chicago emcee Com-
mon (Sense) name-dropped Obama on the track “Real People” (Common, 
2007). The lyrics suggested that both Obama and Common stood in solidar-
ity with “real” people, the poor and working-class masses on “Main Street,” 
not the privileged “Wall Street.” In a culture obsessed with authenticity and 
the real, Common’s assurance of Obama’s street credentials was supported 
by the idea that he and Obama were friends in real life. They are both from 
Chicago and both attended Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s controversial Trinity 
United Church of Christ. Common initiated the practice of pop stars associ-
ating themselves with Obama which would result in superstar rappers like 
Jay-Z, Young Jeezy, Will-I-Am (of the Black Eyed Peas) and Nas becoming 
de-facto members of the Obama campaign. Over the course of the following 
year, hip hop provided the beats and discursive framework for amateur artists 
and bedroom emcees to add their own voices to the “Obama-Hop” movement 
(Gosa, 2010). By late 2007, black youth began uploading hundreds of their 
own Obama-themed rap songs, remixes, and video mashups to the Internet.
The idea that black youth share a collective identity with Obama, and that 
it made sense to enact this identity resource through popular music, was 
memorialized in the September 2007 issue of Vibe magazine. The hip hop, 
urban lifestyle periodical declared that Obama and hip hop was a perfect 
match. The cover of the 14th Anniversary Special “Juice” issue featured 
Obama checking his watch, letting the hip hop community “know the time” 
was “Obama Time,” according to the magazine cover. Like MC Hammer’s 
“Hammer Time” ushered in an era of commercial rap in the early 1990s, the 
“Obama Time” moniker signaled the beginning of a new era in which black 
youth would elect the first black, hip hop president. According to the lead 
article, Obama—referred to as “B-Rock” in the piece—was a “baller [a ball 
player and authentically cool black guy] who still enjoys throwing ’bows on 
the basketball court,” and will be the “first man to rock Air Force Ones [the 
classic hip hop sneaker] on Air Force One [the presidential aircraft]” (Chang, 
www.ebook777.com

Black Youth, Social Media, and the 2008 Presidential Election 
227
2007). Wrapped in the symbolisms of black youth culture, Obama was por-
trayed as one authentically cool candidate.
The media blitzkrieg also worked to place his candidacy within the larger 
history of black politics, while ensuring that his image remained accessible 
as the populist candidate. Vibe played on the collective memories of Black 
Nationalism and the tradition of call and response in black culture. “Obama 
Time” was an allusion to the “Nation Time” chant: “What time is it? Nation 
Time!” The black power chant was popularized by radical jazz musician 
Joe McPhee in 1971, as a tribute to black arts pioneer Amiri Baraka. Rev. 
Jesse Jackson used the same call-and-response to energize black crowds in 
his community organizing efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. Replacing “Na-
tion” with “Obama” was a concise way to connect Obama with the legacy of 
the black liberation struggle. The message served as an invitation for black 
America to become active participants in the movement to elect the first black 
president. On the Internet, the response came in the form of user-generated 
media that sidestepped traditional forms of communication such as maga-
zines. The Obama issue of Vibe magazine represented a last gasp of old media 
print to stay relevant in the emerging era of social, online media. The print 
production of Vibe was shut down and sold in the summer of 2009. Later, it 
returned as a website destination.
Black youth uploaded themselves rapping, yelling, and dancing in support 
of Obama. The explicit message of this activity was “vote for Obama” or 
“rap the vote.” While yelling for one’s candidate is a time-tested, low-tech 
way to influence politics, the digital mixtape represents a new dynamic of 
popular culture and mass politics. First, the mixtape represents an opportu-
nity for youth to shift from popular culture consumers to new media creators. 
Instead of a top-down structuring of music by record labels, this user-centric 
discourse involves youth downloading music, adding their own messages 
and images, and uploading these new creations to music websites (such as 
DatPiff), blogs, MySpace, and P2P file sharing sites.
With titles like “Audacity of Hope,” “Barack Obama: Yes We Can,” 
“Barack Obama Tribute Mixtape,” and “Barack The Vote,” these mixes 
eclipsed the realm of music entertainment to become virtual campaign tools 
used to reverberate Obama’s political platform. These Obama mixes consisted 
of Obama tribute songs by major rappers mixed with amateur productions. 
The music was accompanied by excerpts of Obama’s campaign speeches and 
comedy routines which lampooned Republican candidate John McCain’s age 
or poked fun at George W. Bush’s verbal gaffes. These new media creations 
also contained audio of historic speeches from the 1960s. The words of Civil 
Rights and Black Power icons Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X were 
layered over popular hip hop beats and remixed with the words of Obama.

The Internet provided the opportunity for youth to (re)circulate their home-
made rhymes and impromptu freestyles about Obama. Professional rap stars 
played an important role in the election, but unknown young African Ameri-
can males leveraged the power of webcams and cheap music editing software 
to insert their own opinions about the election. For example, in 2008, an 
online battle erupted over who might create the best Obama-inspired “Obam-
A-Milli” or “Barack-A-Milli” remix, a political take on Lil’ Wayne’s hit song 
“A-Milli.” The winner became a black California teen calling himself A.P.T 
(Aaron P. Taylor), whose clever rhyme parody about Obama garnered more 
than ten million views on YouTube (A.P.T., 2008). The success of the song 
led to A.P.T releasing an online music video and full-length digital album 
of political parodies (“A.P.T: The Next Black Hope”). A.P.T’s version of 
“Obam-A-Milli” led to hundreds of mashup videos of the song on YouTube. 
Kids recorded themselves dancing to the song in their kitchens, while other 
teens provided beatboxing and freestyle renditions from a high school cafete-
ria. The most bizarre mix layered the song over a video of a person wearing 
an Obama Halloween mask and terrorizing shoppers at the mall.
The production of these creations was inherently democratic as anyone 
could and did participate in this online discourse. But African American male 
youth branded themselves as the unofficial face of the Obama campaign. 
This can be seen in the digital photography of mixtapes. The artwork usually 
contained photos of Obama’s face, American flags, red-white-and blue color 
palettes, the Obama Logo (globe containing sun setting over red and white 
landscape), and the campaign’s inspirational slogans such as “Yes We Can” 
and “Change We Can Believe In.” Superimposed in the artworks was often 
the image of Barack Obama with rap superstars such as Lil’ Wayne and T.I. 
To become part of the election process, black youth “Photoshopped” them-
selves into photos with Obama and popular rappers. Other youth became 
Obama-look-a-likes dressed in presidential suits. Of course, these young men 
accented the Obama look with dark sunglasses, diamond-encrusted cross 
necklaces (“Jesus pieces”), and titled baseball hats (“fitteds”).
Remixing Obama was considered ostensibly “political,” given the blur-
ring of distinctions between politics and entertainment. To recall, this was 
the election in which comedian Tina Fey’s impressions of the Republican 
vice-presidential candidate on Saturday Night Live hampered Sarah Palin’s 
poll numbers. Many Americans relied on fake news of Comedy Central’s The 
Daily Show and the Colbert Report for their information about world events. 
For African American youth, the melding of politics and satire involved 
“Auto-Tuning” Obama and network news events.
Auto-Tune, the pitch-tuning synthesizer technology, corrects off-key 
singing, though its overuse produces a robotic distortion of voices. While

the technology has been used since the 1990s to mask the imperfections in 
studio recordings, hip hop and R&B superstar T-Pain created his signature 
sound by explicitly overusing it on every song. The self-proclaimed “Rappa 
Ternt Sanga” (i.e., rapper turned singer) mimicked the synthesizer voice box 
used by Roger Troutman of Zapp & Roger fame in the 1980s. The exagger-
ated (and annoying) use of Auto-Tune by major artists such as Snoop Dogg, 
Kanye West, and Puff Daddy caused Auto-Tune to become an Internet meme, 
as online citizens raced to Auto-Tune everyone from Winston Churchill and 
Adolf Hitler to Barack Obama. An Apple iPhone application called “I Am T-
Pain” allowed users to Auto-Tune otherwise mundane everyday encounters. 
During the early months of the Obama presidency, the Jimmy Kimmel Live 
television show featured a sketch in which T-Pain Auto-Tuned the president. 
T-Pain-style distorted vocals and R&B and hip hop beats would, according to 
the comedic routine, help Obama pass the health care reform bill.
CONCLUSION
The Meaning and Significance of Participation. Social and user-generated 
media were a major part of the 2008 election. Previous research has docu-
mented inequities along the lines of race, gender, and social class, raising 
the question of whether some youth might be excluded from digital de-
mocracy. In this chapter, it has been shown that young black males became 
active participants in the Obama moment. Instead of experiencing the old 
inequities of access and exclusion, they used their race-gender connection 
to Obama and the cultural know-how of hip hop to meld pop culture politics 
into their social media lives.
The case of black youth suggests that digital inequities in new media, like 
the technologies themselves, are fleeting and ever changing, as advantage 
and disadvantage in these spaces are not inherently based on old forms of 
social standing. During the 2008 election, youth, hipness, musicality, and 
popular representations of blackness became valuable commodities. The 
Obama effect allowed black youth to become an important part of the politi-
cal discourse. How patterns of participatory culture between groups change 
over specific moments should be part of future research. This analysis would 
suggest that, in the event of a white female president, the heightened visibility 
of that subgroup could be expected.
This chapter concludes with some observations about the future use and 
impact of social media. If the digital world continues to become a purveyor 
of important economic, social, and political capital, one of the challenges 
will be ensuring that all youth develop the skills necessary to become active

participants. Education initiatives and resources will be needed to deal with 
lingering differences in Internet access and leisure time required to engage 
social media.
Concerning the issue of digital democracy, specifically, excitement about 
this trend must be tempered by some potential problems with the model. First, 
the current democratic nature of the medium is vulnerable to corporate and 
political top-down control and misuse. Organic, user-generated social media 
in 2008 depended on the unauthorized (re)use of copyrighted images and 
media. The ability of youth to create political soundtracks and trade these 
materials on the web could be hindered by take-down notices and threats of 
legal action. Obama’s ability to demonstrate the power of online campaign-
ing will likely cause future politicians to spend even more money on digital 
staffers and collecting social media profiles of potential voters. It is plausible 
that “staged” viral videos crafted by advertising companies could muddy the 
waters, while hired legions of Facebook vandals might be used to create fake 
profiles and spam accounts. The “newness” of social media politics may have 
helped privilege the voice of the masses. African American youth inserted 
themselves at the beginning of the process; hopefully they were able to es-
tablish norms that will make their future participation more likely. Cultural 
practices and relative (dis)advantage can shift, especially as the field becomes 
more institutionalized. How high-stake business and political players attempt 
to dominate this space should be the focus of future research.
Videos of young people rapping about politics or Auto-Tuning the State of 
the Union address is relatively benign. No one got hurt in virtual video dance-
offs between Obama and McCain supporters. However, a second concern 
is the use of this format to spread misinformation and hatred. According to 
some, the blogosphere is flooding the marketplace of ideas with conspiracy 
theory, blind faith, and extremism (Thompson, 2008). Social media can be 
used to launch virtual hate campaigns. After the 2008 election, a backlash of 
white conservatives known as the “Birther” or “Tea Party” movement began 
using the Internet to spread rumors that Obama was secretly born in Kenya 
and was a Muslim terrorist. The wisdom of the crowd, as Keen (2007) argues, 
may be vulnerable to this type of mob mentality. The ability to distinguish 
fact from fiction will become a valuable skill if purposeful misinformation 
continues to spread on the Internet.
Likewise, some political observers are dismayed by the transformation of 
national politics into a virtual popularity contest. According to critics, vot-
ers have become “fans” engaged in an American Idol–esque contest to find 
the next president of the United States. That is, a distinction should be made 
between politics and playing on the Internet. Gladwell (2010) addresses the 
meaning of social activism in the age of social media, especially as it relates

to black youth. Musing that “the revolution will not be Tweeted,” Gladwell 
argues that digital activism through social media bears no resemblance to the 
heroic protests of black youth in the 1950s and 1960s Civil Rights Move-
ment (para. 1). Desegregating lunch counters and facing the Klu Klux Klan 
required strong ties and organization beyond clicking a web link. Social 
media, he argued:
Shifts our energies from organizations that promote strategic and disciplined 
activity and toward those which promote resilience and adaptability. It makes 
it easier for activists to express themselves, and harder for that expression to 
have any impact. The instruments of social media are well suited to making the 
existing social order more efficient. They are not a natural enemy of the status 
quo. (para. 31)
The online creations of black youth discussed in this chapter demonstrated 
the importance of social media for artistic and political expression. It was, in 
fact, quite easy to upload an Obama mix or support video to YouTube. Doing 
so did not involve physical risks or learning discipline; at least not the kind 
realized by freedom fighters of the civil rights revolution. What, then, was the 
actual political significance of black youth’s participation?
Gladwell’s (2010) concerns are well-intentioned, though attenuated by 
the realization of “traditional” political activity in the election. Rapping and 
Auto-Tuning Obama was accompanied by old-school political activism, 
voter registration rallies, lapel buttons, and voter turnout. The instruments of 
social media amplified a social movement of youth activism that was already 
stirring. YouTube just made it more efficient—and entertaining. The digital 
democrats provided the soundtrack to the movement. As political scientist 
Cohen (2010) details in her analysis of the election, “democracy remixed” 
arrived with youth voter (under 30) turnout in 2008 being the highest since 
1972. Importantly, the numbers indicate that black youth, along with white 
Obama youth, provided the margin of victory for the campaign. They decided 
the election, given that older white Americans voted for another candidate 
(Noah, 2008). Unless or until politics moves completely online, civic engage-
ment still requires logging off. In the Obama moment, African American 
youth were part of both real and digital change.

Chapter Fourteen
Legal Pitfalls of Social Media Usage
Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky and Daniel C. Friedel
Social media enrich public discourse by allowing more citizens than ever be-
fore to engage in interactive public discussion and debate. Speakers use social 
media to communicate ideas and information quickly to mass audiences of 
their choosing and even to form associations to achieve important social and 
political goals. One reason, undoubtedly, that so many users flock to social 
media is that they are ideal venues for spontaneous and informal communi-
cation with seemingly sympathetic audiences. Social media foster a sense of 
connectedness among users, so much so that conversations often are more 
akin to informal gossip than formal written communication.
Spontaneity and informality sometimes play positive roles by encourag-
ing robust discourse, but they also can lead to disastrous legal consequences 
for unwitting speakers. American society highly values free speech, but it 
also values civility, individual reputation, privacy, physical and emotional 
security, and dignity. As more and more citizens use social media, increasing 
clashes between these values are inevitable. Courts, policymakers, and law 
enforcement officers are struggling to resolve these clashes both by adapting 
existing legal remedies and developing new ones.
A number of social media users already have discovered the hard way 
that sharing information on social media can subject them to civil lawsuits 
for defamation and both civil and criminal penalties for invasion of privacy, 
cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and sexting. The goal of this chapter is to use 
existing social media case studies to illustrate the legal pitfalls of social media 
usage and explain how the law is adapting to address new problems generated 
by social media usage.

DEFAMATION
Defamation law exists to vindicate society’s “strong interest in preventing 
and redressing attacks upon reputation” (Rosenblatt v. Baer, 1966, p. 86). 
Defamation, when written, is libel; when spoken, it is slander. A communica-
tion is defined as defamatory when it is false and would tend to harm reputa-
tion. Accusations of dishonesty, criminality, and adultery are typical defama-
tory statements. The cause of action for defamation is governed by state law, 
which means that the exact elements a litigant must prove to recover money 
damages varies from state to state. Typically, however, a person suing for 
defamation must prove, at a minimum, that a speaker (or writer) published a 
defamatory statement concerning him or her. If the person about whom the 
defamatory statement was made is a celebrity or public official or the state-
ment concerns important public issues, constitutional protections for freedom 
of expression come into play, and the defamation lawsuit quickly becomes 
complex and expensive to litigate (Lidsky & Wright, 2004).
Courts have been adapting the principles of defamation law to the Internet 
for well over a decade, but social media present new challenges. Even from 
a statistical perspective, social media usage is likely to increase defamation 
actions simply by increasing the quantity of speakers who can disseminate 
potentially defamatory statements to a wide audience. More significantly, so-
cial media use may actually increase the chances for defamation to the extent 
they encourage users to share spontaneously their most trivial observations, 
thoughts, and feelings about their lives and the people surrounding them. 
Computer mediated communication generally has been shown to have a dis-
inhibiting effect on speakers (Joinson, 1998). Social media may exacerbate 
this effect. Social media conversations sometimes have the ephemeral feel of 
gossip among a close group of ostensibly like-minded friends, which encour-
ages speakers to believe that anything goes. Unlike gossip in the physical 
world, however, gossip shared in social media can be copied and shared far 
more widely and in strikingly different contexts than the speaker originally 
imagined or intended. Thus, it is not surprising that Twitter and Facebook 
have already generated defamation lawsuits.
The first Twitter defamation lawsuit was set for trial in early 2011 and 
involved the singer, actor, and celebrity, Courtney Love. Love apparently got 
into a business dispute with fashion designer Dawn Simorangkir (a.k.a. Bou-
doir Queen) over some items of clothing Love had given her to “transform” 
into designer dresses (Complaint at 4-5, Simorangkir v. Love, 2009).
Love, evidently unsatisfied with the Boudoir Queen’s work, refused to 
pay. To add insult to injury, Love posted allegedly defamatory statements 
about the Queen on Twitter, MySpace, and Etsy. Love tweeted, inartfully, 
www.ebook777.com

239
that “police are more than ecstatic to pick [Simorangkir] up she has a history 
of dealing cocaine, lost all custody of her child, assault and burglary. [sic]” 
(Motion to Strike at 3, Simorangkir v. Love, 2009, p. 5). Love also wrote, “so 
goodbye a****** nasty lying h******thief,” as well as “… my clothes my 
WARDROBE! oi vey don’t f*** with my wradrobe or you will end up in a 
circle of sorched earth hunted til your dead” (Complaint at 5, Simorangkir 
v. Love, 2009). Love made similar statements on MySpace and on an Etsy 
feedback forum about Simorangkir. At the time the tweet went online, Love 
had an estimated 40,000 Twitter followers, and more people certainly saw the 
posts on MySpace and Etsy.
In response to Love’s “feedback,” the Boudoir Queen sued for defamation 
(libel) under California law. Love’s attorneys initially responded to Simo-
rangkir’s allegations by claiming that Love was merely warning others about 
“Simorangkir’s pattern of criminal and bad faith conduct” (Motion to Strike 
at 3, Simorangkir v. Love, 2009). Love’s attorneys argued that social media 
outlets like Twitter and MySpace are public sites and that she acted in the 
public interest by “warning other [consumers] of her nightmare experiences” 
(Motion to Strike at 3, Simorangkir v. Love, 2009, p. 3). The California court 
that heard the arguments, however, found that the dispute involved not an is-
sue of public interest but rather “a discrete private dispute between Love and 
Simorangkir” (Heller, 2009, para. 3). The court also rejected the argument 
that the defamatory statements concerned matters of public interest simply 
because they are about Love, since “under that theory, no celebrity could ever 
be found liable for defamation” (Heller, 2009, para. 10).
Besides being the first Twitter-based defamation suit to reach trial, the 
suit poses interesting legal issues. As a result of American society’s commit-
ment to free expression, a speaker cannot be held liable for expressing her 
opinion. Opinion, however, is a legal term of art that refers to statements that 
are unverifiable or cannot be interpreted as stating actual facts. For example, 
hyperbole, which involves the exaggeration of facts for emotional effect, 
is not actionable as defamation (Milkovich v. Lorain Journal, 1990). Thus, 
calling a doctor a murderer is not an actionable defamatory statement if it is 
clear from the context that the label “murderer” is attached because the doctor 
performs legal abortions to which the speaker is opposed. In a 140-character 
tweet, however, the speaker has little chance to clarify her meaning and pro-
vide relevant context that might establish her tweet as hyperbole. In Love’s 
case, she is well known for her “over the top” behavior in general, perhaps 
indicating her followers on Twitter might expect most of her tweets to contain 
hyperbole. Love also provided a series of tweets that may have alerted some 
audience members to the context of her dispute with the Boudoir Queen, but 
it is an open question whether the tweets should be read together to establish

the “context” supporting her statement that the Boudoir Queen was a “ly-
ing hosebag thief” (Complaint at 4, Simorangkir v. Love, 2009). Certainly, 
Love’s accusations of criminality seem to indicate that she had undisclosed 
(and potentially false) factual information, which certainly makes it harder 
(or likely impossible) for her to shield her statements under the mantle of 
opinion. Nonetheless, the Love saga is instructive about the perils of assum-
ing that one can vent one’s frustrations about another in social media without 
legal repercussions.
Not all social media defamation suits involve celebrities with thousands of 
online followers. In July of 2009, Horizon Group Management, an Illinois-
based property management company, sued tenant Amanda Bonnen for 
defamation after she tweeted: “Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment was 
bad for you? Horizon realty thinks it’s ok.” (Complaint at 2, Horizon Grp. 
Mgmt. v. Bonnen, 2009). At the time of the tweet, Bonnen had only twenty 
people subscribing to her Twitter posts, but her account was set as public. 
In Illinois, successful defamation claimants must prove that the defendant 
speaker “published” a false statement to at least one third party and that the 
“unprivileged publication” damaged the plaintiff (Solaia Tech., LLC v. Spe-
cialty Publ’g Co., 2006, p. 839). Horizon alleged that Bonnen’s defamatory 
tweet harmed its “reputation in its business,” and therefore fell into a special 
category of libel (libel per se) that allows reputational harm to be presumed 
without the requirement of proof. Horizon sought $50,000 in compensation 
(Complaint at 2, Horizon Grp. Mgmt. v. Bonnen, 2009). Bonnen asked the 
court to dismiss Horizon’s claims. She contended that her tweet could not 
reasonably be interpreted as defamatory because it was imprecise and, when 
read in context, did not state actual, verifiable facts about Horizon. As part 
of that context, she asked the court to consider her Twitter history leading up 
to the statement at issue, claiming her tweets as a whole represented “off the 
cuff reflection or opinion” and contained “exaggerations” (Memorandum of 
Law at 9, Horizon Grp. Mgmt. v. Bonnen, 2009). For example, she pointed 
to tweets that said: “[c]all me or else we are not friends” and “[a]ll of these 
people eating at McDonalds is making me want to hurl” (Memorandum of 
Law at 9, Horizon Grp. Mgmt. v. Bonnen, 2009). She contended that “any 
reasonable reader of [her] Tweets would not take them literally” and would 
instead understand them as rhetorical hyperbole (Memorandum of Law at 
9, Horizon Grp. Mgmt. v. Bonnen, 2009). The trial court judge accepted her 
argument and ruled that her statements were nonactionable as a matter of law 
(Dismissal Order at 1, Horizon Grp. Mgmt. v. Bonnen, 2010). The court did 
not file a written opinion, but one of Bonnen’s attorneys, Leslie Ann Reis, 
claimed that at the dismissal hearing, the judge stated that the tweet was “re-
ally too vague to fit the legal elements required to prove a libel case” (Wang, 
www.ebook777.com

241
2010, para. 10). It is not clear what the court meant by this statement. Perhaps 
the court was not convinced that readers would understand that the statement 
referred to Horizon Group Management. Another view, put forth by First 
Amendment attorney Julie Hilden, is that the judge dismissed an otherwise 
valid defamation claim because “Horizon would never be able to prove that 
it had incurred any but the most minimal damages” resulting from a single 
tweet to a very few followers (Hilden, 2010, para. 20). The judge may also 
have wanted to prevent a corporation like Horizon Group Management from 
using the threat of a defamation suit to silence not just Bonnen but all other 
tenants who might make similar complaints.
Even if Bonnen’s story ends happily for free expression in social media, 
speakers would do well to remember that even when a social media com-
munication seems “private,” it has the potential to generate a defamation 
lawsuit that is costly to defend even if it is ultimately dismissed. In 2009, a 
high school student sued Facebook Inc., several former classmates, and their 
parents for $3 million after nasty remarks about her appeared on a “private” 
Facebook page called “Ninety Cents Short of a Dollar” (Complaint at 4, Fin-
kel v. Facebook, 2009). She sued her former classmates for posting defama-
tory statements on the Facebook page, their parents for negligent supervision 
of their children, and Facebook for not removing the offending posts. The 
Facebook page at issue was set up so that no one could access it without ob-
taining permission from an “administrator,” and it appears that the page had 
six members only (Complaint at 4, Finkel v. Facebook, 2009).
The posts at issue were truly disgusting. They stated, “BTW the 11th cent, 
[evidently, the plaintiff] unbeknownst to many, acquired AIDS while on a 
cruise to Africa …While in Africa she was seen f****** a horse… I felt 
WORSE for the horse.” The posts continued in this nasty tone, also stating, in 
similar language, that she “persisted to s**** a baboon,” that she patronized 
a male prostitute and that her disease was so bad “that she morfed [sic] into 
the devil in one of our pictures” (Complaint at 4, Finkel v. Facebook, 2009).
Despite the vile nature of the posts, a New York court dismissed all of the 
plaintiff’s claims. The claim against Facebook fell prey to a provision of the 
Communications Decency Act (1996), a federal statute that immunizes the 
providers of “interactive computer services” from liability for defamatory 
content posted by the users of such services. More surprisingly, the New 
York state court judge dismissed the claims against the adolescents who 
had posted the insulting statements because she concluded that the posts 
could not reasonably be interpreted as making factual assertions about the 
plaintiff’s sexual behavior. Viewed in light of “the broader social context or 
setting surrounding the communication” and “the entire context and tone of 
the posts,” the court found that the statements on Facebook could “only be

Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky and Daniel C. Friedel
read as puerile attempts by adolescents to outdo each other” (Order Dismiss-
ing Remaining Claims at 7, Finkel v. Dauber, 2010). Instead of believing the 
posted material, a reasonable reader would interpret them as “evidence of ad-
olescent insecurities and indulgences, and a vulgar attempt at humor” rather 
than defamatory “statements of facts” (Order Dismissing Remaining Claims 
at 7, Finkel v. Dauber, 2010). Finally, the court found that New York law did 
not recognize a claim for negligent parental supervision based on failure to 
keep one’s adolescent child from posting such material on a private Facebook 
page (Order Dismissing Remaining Claims at 7, Finkel v. Dauber, 2010). 
Although Finkel’s defamation suit was unsuccessful, its resolution was by 
no means certain. What the New York judge interpreted as hyperbole might, 
in the hands of another judge, have been viewed as implying that the plain-
tiff was sexually promiscuous, even if they did contain fantastical elements. 
Moreover, the lawsuit embroiled both those who made the allegedly defama-
tory statements and their parents in a costly, stressful, time-consuming, and 
embarrassing lawsuit, even if they ultimately prevailed. The case therefore 
illustrates one of the legal perils speakers face in social media, even when 
they believe themselves to be among friends.
INVASION OF PRIVACY AND 
OTHER BASES OF CIVIL LIABILITY
Although claims for defamation appear to be the most common civil claims 
brought against social media users to date, it is worth noting that social 
media-based lawsuits will often involve additional theories of liability. The 
complaint in Simorangkir v. Love (Complaint at 4, Simorangkir v. Love, 
2009), for example, involved not only defamation but claims for intentional 
infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, intentional interference 
with prospective and advantageous business relationships, and breach of 
contract. Often, these additional claims are simply added as “fallbacks” or 
“make-weights” to the defamation claim, but this is not always the case.
One theory of liability likely to be used against social media users whose 
revelations transgress social norms and injure others is the tort of invasion 
of privacy. For over a hundred years, American tort law has been struggling 
to define how far the institutional mass media may delve into the intimate 
lives of the people they cover, how “outrageously” or viciously they may 
parody or satirize their targets, and how much they may exploit private 
information for entertainment or profit (Lidsky & Wright, 2004). The dif-
ficulty has always been in balancing the individual’s right to privacy with 
the speakers’ rights to freedom of expression and the public’s right to know,

Legal Pitfalls of Social Media Usage 
243
and the emergence of social media is likely to make striking this difficult 
balance even more difficult.
Two recent cases involving social media confirm this prediction. In 2009, 
a Minnesota appellate court decided a case involving one of the first civil 
lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy via publication on a social media site. 
In that case, Yath v. Fairview Clinics (2009), a clinic worker revealed hu-
miliating medical information illicitly gleaned from a patient’s medical file to 
the patient’s sister-in-law. The private information included the fact that the 
patient had cheated on her husband and had a sexually transmitted disease. 
This humiliating information later appeared on a MySpace page referring to 
the patient as Rotten Candy (Yath v. Fairview Clinics, 2009, pp. 38–39). The 
web page was taken down within a day or so, and the patient was only able 
to verify that six people had accessed it while it was on MySpace (Yath v. 
Fairview Clinics, 2009, pp. 38-39).
She nonetheless brought suit against the clinic worker and her former 
sister-in-law for invading her privacy by publishing private information about 
her. Minnesota law makes a defendant who discloses private information 
about another liable for damages if the plaintiff can show that the defendant 
gave “publicity” to a private matter about the plaintiff; disclosure of the in-
formation would be highly offensive to a reasonable person; and the matter 
was not of legitimate concern to the public (Yath v. Fairview Clinics, 2009, 
p. 42). The Minnesota Court of Appeals found that the plaintiff had shown 
sufficient “publicity” of her private information to maintain a claim, even 
though the MySpace page may have been seen by only a few users (Yath v. 
Fairview Clinics, 2009, p. 43). The court analogized the publication that oc-
curred on the MySpace page in the Yath case to publication in a newspaper 
with a small distribution. The court therefore found that it was irrelevant, 
for purposes of establishing “publicity,” that few people may have seen it: 
liability “is triggered when the discloser makes the information publicly 
available,” rather than when it is received by an appreciable number of users 
(Yath v. Fairview Clinics, 2009, pp. 43–44). Thus, “the publicity element of 
an invasion of privacy claim is satisfied when private information is posted 
on a publicly accessible website” (Yath v. Fairview Clinics, 2009, p. 44).
Even so, the Minnesota court dismissed the plaintiff’s invasion of pri-
vacy claim, due to strategic errors she (or, more likely, her lawyer) made 
in pursuing her claim rather than a lack of merit in the claim itself. The 
plaintiff made a strategic choice not to appeal a trial court ruling dismissing 
her claim against the clinic worker who accessed and disclosed her medical 
information. The plaintiff dropped the claim against the worker despite hav-
ing evidence that the worker had colluded with another person to post the 
information on MySpace (Yath v. Fairview Clinics, 2009, p. 45). Thus, the

Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky and Daniel C. Friedel
plaintiff’s invasion of privacy against her former sister-in-law failed for lack 
of evidence that the sister-in-law was the person who posted the information 
on MySpace. Nonetheless, the appellate court went out of its way to suggest 
that the plaintiff’s claims against those who actually posted her information 
might be valid if “revived” (Yath v. Fairview Clinics, 2009, p. 45).
If the Yath case is instructive about the dangers of revealing private infor-
mation about someone else in a social media forum, a California appellate 
case, Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc. (2009), is instructive about the dan-
gers of revealing “private” information about oneself. While Cynthia Moreno 
was a college student at Berkeley, she visited her hometown of Coalinga, 
California. Moreno subsequently published on her MySpace page a very 
negative “Ode to Coalinga,” in which she stated, among other things, that 
“the older I get, the more I realize how much I despise Coalinga” (Moreno v. 
Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, p. 861). The principal of Coalinga High School 
obtained the Ode and forwarded it to a local reporter. After publication of 
the Ode in the local newspaper, Cynthia Moreno’s family received death 
threats, and a shot was fired at their home. They were forced to move away 
from Coalinga (Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, p. 861). They sued 
the principal and the local newspaper for invasion of privacy and intentional 
infliction of emotional distress. The trial court dismissed the case against the 
newspaper under a special California statute designed to prevent lawsuits 
from silencing commentary on issues of public significance. The Moreno 
family did not appeal the trial court’s ruling as to the newspaper, but they did 
appeal the trial court’s dismissal of their claims against the principal for inva-
sion of privacy and for intentional infliction of emotional distress (Moreno v. 
Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, p. 861).
With regard to the privacy claim, the California appellate court held that 
the plaintiffs were missing a “crucial ingredient” of a valid claim because 
the revelations concerning the Ode simply were not private once Cynthia 
Moreno posted them on MySpace, “a hugely popular internet site” (Moreno 
v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, p. 862). According to the court, “Cynthia’s 
affirmative act made her article available to any person with a computer and 
thus opened it to the public eye.” (Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, 
p. 862). “Under these circumstances, no reasonable person would have had 
an expectation of privacy regarding the published material” (Moreno v. 
Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, p. 862). The court found it immaterial that few 
viewers actually accessed Moreno’s MySpace page. By posting it, Moreno 
opened her thoughts to “the public at large,” and “[h]er potential audience 
was vast” regardless of the size of the actual one (Moreno v. Hanford Sen-
tinel, Inc., 2009, p. 863). As Cynthia Moreno learned to her sorrow, there is 
no privacy invasion when information shared with a seemingly “friendly”

245
audience is repeated to a hostile one (Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 
2009, p. 863). Nonetheless, the court held open the possibility that a claim 
for intentional infliction of emotional distress could succeed, at least if a 
jury determined that the principal’s forwarding of the Ode to the newspa-
per was objectively “outrageous” (Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc., 2009, 
p. 861). The case therefore sends a mixed message about legitimate use of 
information shared in social media. On one hand, the information is not 
private. On the other, republication can still lead to liability if done for the 
purpose of inflicting emotional distress on another in a manner that jurors 
might subsequently deem “outrageous.”
CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR PRIVACY INVASIONS
Those who speak and share information in social media must be aware 
not only of the potential for civil liability but criminal liability as well. 
One tragic case leading to criminal charges involved 18-year-old Tyler 
Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who committed suicide after 
his college roommate surreptitiously filmed and (allegedly) live streamed 
over the Internet (via iChat) images of him “making out with” another man 
(Tyler Clementi Suicide Sparks Outrage, Remorse, 2010, para. 8). The pri-
vacy invasion that brought about Clementi’s suicide began on September 
19, 2010, when Clementi asked his roommate, Dharun Ravi, for privacy. 
Ravi went to his friend Molly Wei’s dorm room, but tweeted to his nearly 
150 Twitter followers, “[r]oommate asked for the room till midnight. I went 
into molly’s room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a 
dude. Yay.” (Miller, 2010, para. 7). On September 22, 2010, just three days 
after Ravi and Wei allegedly broadcast the images of him, Tyler Clementi 
posted on his Facebook page “jumping from the gw bridge sorry” (Tyler 
Clementi Suicide Sparks Outrage, Remorse, 2010, para. 13). Immediately 
afterward, Clementi indeed jumped to his death into the Hudson River from 
the George Washington Bridge.
After Clementi’s death, a New Jersey prosecutor brought criminal charges 
against Ravi and Wei for invasion of privacy pursuant to New Jersey law, 
which makes criminal the unconsented recording of images depicting sexual 
contact (N.J. Stat., 2010). The statute also makes it an offense punishable by 
a prison sentence of up to five years to transmit or distribute such images 
(N.J. Stat., 2010). The attorney for Ravi told newspapers that Ravi and Wei 
only viewed Clementi “hugging and kissing” for a few minutes and never 
broadcast the images to others (Friedman, 2010). However, charges were still 
pending at the time of this writing. In the meantime, Clementi’s parents filed

notice of their intent to sue Rutgers University for not doing more to protect 
their son, who evidently reported Ravi’s actions to his dorm’s resident advi-
sor prior to his suicide (Fanelli, 2010). Certainly, Clementi’s case is a tragic 
illustration of the harm that victims feel when they believe their private en-
counters have been transmitted to the world at large via social media. Even if 
Ravi and Wei are ultimately acquitted, the decision to prosecute them reflects 
societal outrage over their cavalier sharing of private information heedless of 
the harm it might cause.
CYBERBULLYING
The law is creative in adapting old theories to perceived new problems, but it 
is also capable of generating new theories of legal liability to deal with new 
social problems. One spur to creation of new legal remedies is the phenom-
enon of cyberbullying, which is the essence of the claim involved in both the 
Finkel defamation lawsuit discussed above as well as the criminal invasion 
of privacy case brought against Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei after the death 
of Tyler Clementi. Indeed, within a few months of Clementi’s suicide, New 
Jersey enacted the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights, Assembly Bill No. 3466 
(2010), which “requires school districts to establish bullying prevention 
programs or approaches” and subjects school administrators to discipline for 
“fail(ing) to initiate or conduct an investigation of an incident, or who should 
have known of an incident and fails to take action” (Anti-Bullying Bill of 
Rights, 2010). Although this reform is relatively modest, it is responsive to 
the public frustration over the lack of adequate preventive measures to stop 
tragedies like Clementi’s.
It is unclear whether Clementi’s case is an anomaly or merely the tip of 
an iceberg, but studies suggest that the number of cyberbullying incidents 
among middle and high school students appears to be multiplying (Hinduja 
& Patchin, 2010). Bullying is by no means a new phenomenon. Prior to the 
advent of the Internet, bullying usually occurred face-to-face, with aggres-
sors dishing out insults, calling names, shunning, and sometimes physically 
assaulting victims. Now bullying has moved online. Cyberbullying typically 
involves the intentional humiliation of another person via use of electronic 
devices, such as “in an email, a text message, an online game, or comments 
on a social networking site” (Net Cetera, 2010, p. 20).
From a victim’s perspective, cyberbullying may be worse than many types 
of “offline” bullying. Cyberbulllying can target the victim in the confines 
of her home, and the victim may fear that anything said about her may be 
searchable indefinitely and thus haunt her for years. The cyberbully by con-

trast, may not always appreciate the effect of his words. In Bullying Beyond 
the Schoolyard, researchers Hinduja and Patchin (2009) suggest that cyber-
bullying sometimes occurs because the passive nature of online communi-
cation makes the bullying speaker unaware of the effects of his speech. In 
face-to-face interactions, physical cues often signal when speech transgresses 
social norms and causes emotional distress. But when people communicate 
online, such signals are absent (Hinduja & Patchin, 2009, p. 22). Without 
instant feedback from the victim, the bully may have difficulty registering 
the effect of his speech, and he is thus less likely to apologize or clarify that 
he meant no offense.
Although cyberbullying is associated with schoolchildren, a case of cyber-
bullying perpetrated by Missouri mom Lori Drew focused a public spotlight 
on the harm that speech in social media can cause to children and even 
prompted the development of a new legal theory to address that harm. The 
49-year-old Drew opened a MySpace account as “Josh Evans,” a teenage 
boy, in order to start a correspondence with her 13-year-old daughter’s former 
friend Megan Meier (Steinhauser, 2008, para. 9). After winning Meier’s trust, 
“Josh” cruelly ended the friendship by email, telling her “[t]he world would 
be a better place without you” (Steinhauser, 2008, para. 10). Meier emailed 
back, “You’re the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over” (Steinhauser, 
2008, para. 11). Megan hanged herself approximately fifteen minutes after 
these messages were sent over the MySpace servers (Steinhauser, 2008, 
para. 11). There were no cyberbullying laws in Missouri at the time of 
Meier’s death, but because of the national outrage of an adult manipulating 
a minor to kill herself, a federal prosecutor concocted a criminal case against 
Lori Drew under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of (1986). Essentially, 
the jury convicted Drew of “defrauding” MySpace by misrepresenting her 
identity and motives to open an account (Steinhauser, 2008). The jury found 
that Drew had accessed a computer involved in interstate communication 
(the MySpace Servers) without authorization or in excess of authorization 
(in violation of MySpace’s terms of service) to obtain information, thereby 
committing computer fraud (Steinhauser, 2008).
The trial court ultimately overturned the jury’s verdict and acquitted Drew. 
The court reasoned that the Act was unconstitutionally vague because it did 
not put Drew on notice that the breach of the MySpace “terms of service 
contract” could be a crime (United States v. Drew, 2009, p. 464). The court 
further stated that the Act did not provide guidance for law enforcement re-
garding when to enforce a breach of a website’s terms of service contract as 
a criminal act. Without “clear guidelines or objective criteria as to the prohib-
ited conduct,” federal law enforcement would be “improperly free to pursue 
their personal predilections” (United States v. Drew, 2009, p. 467). In the end,

Drew was acquitted of all federal charges and was never charged with any 
state crimes relating to her phony MySpace account or Meier’s suicide. None-
theless, the case is a cautionary tale about the dangers of cyberbullying and 
the potential for lawmakers to develop new theories of liability to address it.
As of December 2010, forty-four states have passed laws that address bul-
lying. Of those, thirty-one include electronic harassment, but only six states 
include the term “cyberbullying” (Hinduja & Patchin, 2010). States have suc-
cessfully brought cases for cyberbullying against minors, but some of these 
laws may be declared unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as cases make 
their way through the appellate courts. As of January 2011, there was no fed-
eral cyberbullying law in effect, but House Resolution 1966, designated the 
Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act, was proposed and is pending 
before the House Judiciary Committee. If passed, it would constitute another 
new tool against cyberbullying in social media.
SEXTING AND CYBERSTALKING
As social media become more popular, some crimes that previously took 
place through texting or email may migrate into social media. One of these is 
“sexting.” Sexting is a relatively new term used to describe the imposition of 
criminal liability for “sending or forwarding sexually explicit photos, videos, 
or messages from a mobile phone” (Net Cetera, 2010, p. 19). To date, most 
“sexting” cases have involved the sending of text messages. However, a sex-
ting case also can arise when the receiver of sexually explicit photos decides 
to post them to Facebook, MySpace, or other social media outlets.
Sexting can create liability in a host of ways. At a minimum, posting a 
nude photo without consent can lead to a civil lawsuit for invasion of privacy. 
Yet, even the posting of a “fake” nude photo posted online can lead to liabil-
ity. In a 2011 Florida case, prosecutors brought felony aggravated stalking 
charges against two teenage girls who allegedly posted a fake nude photo of a 
classmate on a Facebook page. They created the photo by pasting a picture of 
the victim’s head on a picture of a nude body, and the victim evidently faced 
widespread ridicule within her school (Florida Teens Charged with Felony 
Cyber Bullying, 2011).
Even more serious criminal charges await any person who makes sexu-
ally explicit materials available to a minor or posts images of a minor within 
social media. Prosecutors have threatened to charge teens who text explicit 
images of themselves to “consenting” minors with felony child pornography 
(Miller v. Mitchell, 2010). Moreover, an 18-year-old who texted nude photos 
of his girlfriend to others was convicted of distributing child pornography and

branded a sex offender, a designation he will bear until age 43 (Feyerick & 
Steffen, 2009). The potential criminal penalties for sexting can be so serious 
that some states, such as New Jersey and South Carolina, are trying to cre-
ate programs that would soften the penalties or allow teens to avoid criminal 
prosecution by participating in educational “diversionary” programs (Santi, 
2011; Boone, 2010). Although no sexting case involving social media has 
yet become national news, the prevalence of social media use for intimate 
and sometimes impulsive conversation makes it very likely that it will soon.
Cyberstalking is a serious criminal offense that has already migrated to so-
cial media. In simplest terms, cyber stalking involves the “use of the Internet, 
e-mail, or other electronic communications devices to stalk another person . . 
. that generally involves harassing or threatening behavior that an individual 
engages in repeatedly” (Attorney General of the United States, 1999, para. 5). 
States define cyberstalking in various ways. The state of Florida, for example, 
defines cyberstalking as the use of email or other electronic channels to 
communicate words, images, or language to a specific person, repeatedly, to 
serve no legitimate purpose, and that causes the person “substantial emotional 
distress” (Fla. Stat., 2010). When one “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly” 
cyberstalks another, he or she can be charged with a misdemeanor offense, 
though the offense becomes a felony when the target is under age sixteen. If 
the harassment includes a threat intended to create reasonable fear of bodily 
injury to the victim or the victim’s family, the crime becomes aggravated 
stalking (Fla. Stat., 2010). Florida law permits law enforcement to arrest any-
one they have probable cause to believe has violated the cyber stalking law, 
even without an arrest warrant (Fla. Stat., 2010).
In December of 2010, law enforcement officials arrested 27-year-old 
Mitchell W. Hill of Key West, Florida, on charges that he sexually harassed 
women who pledged a sorority at Louisiana State University (Clark, 2010). 
Hill is also a suspect for similar cyberstalking incidents against sorority 
members at Florida State University and the University of Florida as well as 
schools in other states (Clark, 2010). In these cases, Hill initiated the alleged 
cyberstalking by contacting a sorority pledge on Facebook and requesting 
her to become a Facebook friend. He claimed to be an alumna of the soror-
ity the victim was pledging. He then requested to video chat, but he claimed 
to have a faulty webcam so that only images of the female victim would be 
captured and transmitted to him (University Students are Targets of Cyber 
Stalkers, 2010). Hill allegedly asked his victims personal questions such as 
the color of their underwear. Over time, he requested the victims to disrobe in 
front of the webcam as part of the pledging initiation. If the victims refused 
a demand, he threatened to post compromising pictures on Facebook and 
block their entry into the sorority (University Students are Targets of Cyber

Stalkers, 2010). Florida State University student, Ashley Atchison, was one of 
the first to report what was happening. She told law enforcement authorities 
that in response to her refusal to one of the perpetrator’s suggestive demands, 
he threatened, “what if I told you there were two girls outside your dorm that 
could handle you?” (University Students are Targets of Cyber Stalkers, 2010). 
As a result of Hill’s Facebook activities, Louisiana prosecutors have charged 
him with extortion, video voyeurism, and attempted video voyeurism, and 
Florida law enforcement are still conducting an investigation into his alleged 
cyberstalking (University Students are Targets of Cyber Stalkers, 2010).
CONCLUSION
As usage of social media increases, uninhibited speech and information shar-
ing are increasingly clashing with other important social values, such as the 
preservation of civility in public discourse and the protection of individual 
reputation, privacy, security, and dignity on the other. To mediate these 
clashes, courts have adapted and will continue to adapt existing legal theories 
to new media problems. Meanwhile, legislatures are creating entirely new 
theories of liability in an effort to curtail antisocial behaviors.
Currently defamation is the claim most likely to be deployed by private liti-
gants against uncivil communication within social media. The rise of social 
media defamation claims is forcing American courts to adapt a legal theory 
borrowed centuries ago from England to the new types of discourse taking 
place in social media spaces like Facebook and Twitter. This legal adaptation 
is necessary to address, for example, whether the conventions of communica-
tion within a “private” Facebook page or on a celebrity Twitter feed should 
influence the interpretation of allegedly defamatory statements. Civil claims 
for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress have 
also presented difficult legal questions: Can the repetition of statement pub-
lished to friends on MySpace ever form the basis of an invasion of privacy 
claim? Should a person be held liable for the emotional harm caused when he 
disseminates a “friend’s” MySpace comments originally made to a limited, 
“friendly” audience to a much broader, “hostile” audience? Tentative legal 
answers to these and other new questions are beginning to emerge, as the law 
responds to pleas by private litigants for compensation for harms allegedly 
suffered through social media communication. As courts continue to respond 
to similar claims, their decisions will inevitably impose a civilizing influence 
on communication within this new realm.
Meanwhile, criminal law is struggling to police the most extreme abuses 
attendant to social media communication. Several teens such as 18-year-old

Rutgers student Tyler Clementi have killed themselves in response to cyber-
bullying, and legislatures have responded to these incidents with new laws 
designed to prevent and punish cyberbullying conduct. In the meantime, pros-
ecutors have charged alleged cyberbullies with criminal privacy invasion and 
even computer fraud and abuse in an attempt to ensure that perpetrators do 
not escape punishment. The search for adequate legal responses to cyberbul-
lying, its adult sibling cyberstalking, and even sexting is likely to continue as 
existing forms of antisocial behavior migrate to social media.

Chapter Fifteen
The Realm of the Expected: 
Redefining the Public and 
Private Spheres in Social Media
Jasmine E. McNealy
In the United States the definition of privacy is the source of much conten-
tion. Definitions are diverse and at times disparate, prompting one scholar to 
call the large number of conceptions of privacy embarrassing (Gerety, 1977, 
p. 234). Privacy has been called secrecy (Posner, 1998), intimacy (Inness, 
1992), and information control (Westin, 1967). Privacy has also been related 
to total fulfillment as a person (Craven, Jr., 1976) and the right to be let alone 
(Warren & Brandeis, 1890). These conceptions of privacy appear to be based 
on what the theorists believe is most important with regard to the kinds of 
information or relationships the law should protect.
In privacy law related to both government prosecutions and civil proceed-
ings, privacy depends upon the circumstances surrounding the disclosure—
what is called the expectation of privacy. For example, in Katz v. United 
States (1967), the U.S. Supreme Court found the act of closing a telephone 
booth’s door created a temporary zone of privacy for the booth’s occupant, 
and that an individual did not relinquish the right to exclude others from 
his conversation just because he used a public facility. Yet, in more than 40 
years since the Katz decision, with Justice Potter Stewart famously stating, 
“The Fourth Amendment protects people—and not simply ‘areas’—against 
unreasonable searches and seizures” (p. 351), private “places” have not been 
defined concretely.
Social media like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter can be considered both 
public and third-party, designations that have historically vitiated an indi-
vidual’s privacy claims. Under traditional privacy law, one could argue, for 
example, that in making their tweets public and using social media, Twitter 
users have no expectation that the 140 characters they place in their status 
boxes are private. But new media and new methods of communication may

require rethinking what information is protected as private. A growing num-
ber of individuals use social media to communicate and connect with others. 
This may involve placing otherwise private information online.
But is it truly reasonable for an individual using social media to expect 
that the information they provide to these media platforms will remain pri-
vate? This chapter examined what is now considered public and private with 
respect to “personal information” and social media. To do this, the chapter 
considers traditional as well as modern privacy theory, and legal opinions 
regarding privacy as they relate to social media.
THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY
The Katz (1967) case arose after FBI agents, who were investigating orga-
nized gambling, secretly recorded a man’s calls to a bookie made from a 
telephone booth. Although the majority of the Katz Court ruled the man’s 
conversations were private and the agents violated his Fourth Amendment 
right to privacy when they recorded him, it is Justice Harlan’s brief concur-
rence that has helped to shape many of the rulings with regard to what is 
private. In his concurrence, Justice Harlan annunciated a concept later called 
“the reasonable expectation of privacy” (p. 9). Harlan wrote, “My under-
standing of the rule that has emerged from prior decisions is that there is a 
twofold requirement, first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) 
expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is 
prepared to recognize as ‘reasonable’” (Katz v. United States, 1967, p. 361). 
For Harlan, this meant that a person’s home was the place with the greatest 
expectation of privacy. The same could not be said for anything an individual 
said or did in public.
Post-Katz, the Court has delivered rulings detailing when and where indi-
viduals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, individu-
als do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers 
that they have dialed because in pressing the buttons on their telephones, they 
have provided the information to a third party (Smith v. Maryland, 1979). 
Nor do people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the trash that they 
leave on the curb for removal because it is exposed and available to the pub-
lic (California v. Greenwood, 1988). What’s more, the Supreme Court ruled 
that a man did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents 
of his greenhouse, which the police were able to observe while flying over 
in a small aircraft because the officers were able to view the contents from 
public airspace (Florida v. Riley, 1989). The aggregate rule from these court 
decisions and others defining reasonable privacy expectations is that although

reasonableness will depend upon the situation there is no reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in information exposed to others. The lack of a formal defini-
tion of a reasonable expectation of privacy, however, provoked Justice Scalia 
to assert, “reasonable expectations of privacy bear an uncanny resemblance 
to those expectations of privacy that this Court considers reasonable” (Min-
nesota v. Carter, 1998, p. 477).
The idea of a reasonable expectation of privacy is not solely found in 
Fourth Amendment related jurisprudence, but it is also found in tort privacy 
law. In the United States, tort privacy has its foundation in an 1890 Har-
vard Law Review article appropriately titled “The Right to Privacy,” which 
called for the recognition of a “right to be let alone” (Warren & Brandeis, 
1890). Legislatures and courts began recognizing privacy torts soon after 
the article’s publication. Prosser (1960) fleshed out Warren and Brandeis’ 
new tort by evaluating the privacy cases that had arisen after the 1890 
article’s publication, and found that, “The law of privacy comprises four 
distinct kinds of invasion four different interests of the plaintiff” (p. 389). In 
two of these invasions, intrusion upon seclusion and publication of private 
facts, the courts examine reasonableness with respect to the plaintiff’s claim 
of invasion of privacy.
Intrusion is the intentional and highly offensive invasion of a zone of pri-
vacy created by another individual (Restatement of Torts, 1965, sec. 652B). 
This invasion can be physical or electronic so long as a person enters an 
otherwise private place or the affairs that another has taken the effort to keep 
private (Restatement of Torts, 1965, sec. 652B comment (c)). Therefore, just 
as in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, a person has the greatest expectation 
of privacy in his home. Although one’s home is a major sphere of privacy, 
information found in public records or observed in areas open to the public 
are not the subject of intrusion liability (Desnick v. ABC, Inc., 1995; Nader 
v. General Motors Corp., 1970). Concomitantly, the courts have recognized 
that certain information observable in public may provide a cause of action 
for intrusion.
In intrusion cases, a reasonable expectation of privacy is an objective stan-
dard to be judged by a jury. This standard is evaluated based on what society 
would consider reasonable. The justification for this standard is “address[ing] 
the problem of idiosyncratic individual preferences,” in relation to privacy 
“Some individuals may have an unusually strong desire for privacy and may 
make impossible demands for privacy” (Solove, 2008, p. 71). In place of a 
variable standard of privacy, the courts use a standard that comports most 
with public policy. Individuals have no expectation of privacy in what they 
say or do in public, therefore, because society would not consider it reason-
able for an individual to claim privacy in actions that are readily observable.

Public disclosure of private facts also makes use of a reasonableness 
expectation rooted in societal norms. This category of invasion of privacy 
asks whether the defendant has publicized private information about the 
plaintiff (Restatement of Torts, 1965, sec. 652D). The focus is not so much 
on whether or not the information was private, but whether the publication of 
the information was highly offensive to a reasonable person (Restatement of 
Torts, 1965, sec. 652D comment (c)). This highly offensive requirement, like 
the reasonable expectation requirement, takes into account societal views of 
offensiveness. It is, for example, highly offensive to a reasonable person to 
publish the photograph of a woman whose skirt has blown up above her head 
in public (Daily Times Democrat v. Graham, 1964), or reporting that some-
one suffered from a rare disease (Barber v. Time, Inc., 1942). At the same 
time it is not highly offensive to publish a picture of a young couple kissing 
at a restaurant (Gill v. Hearst Publishing Co., 1953), or of a young woman 
exposing her breasts at a rock concert (Mayhall v. Dennis, 2002).
A final consideration in evaluating publication of private facts is newswor-
thiness. The question here is whether there is a public interest in the disclosed 
information. Although there is no established rule with respect to newswor-
thiness, the courts have used at least three different tests in analyzing whether 
there is a legitimate public interest in certain information (Dendy, 1997). 
These tests are aimed at avoiding a confrontation with the First Amendment 
for punishing the publication of information. One such test was excerpted 
from Virgil v. Time (1975), and the Restatement of Torts later adopted it. 
It requires the courts to evaluate the “customs and conventions of the com-
munity” when deciding newsworthiness (p. 1129). Another key test is found 
in the well-known case of Sipple v. Chronicle Publishing Co. (1984). In that 
case, Oliver Sipple, the man who had thwarted an assassination attempt on 
President Gerald Ford, sued a newspaper for disclosing that he was gay, but 
the Court found that the customs and conventions of the community dictated 
that Sipple had become news. Therefore, the disclosure about his private life 
did not invade his privacy.
The jurisprudence of intrusion, public disclosure of private facts, and 
Fourth Amendment–related privacy has been easily applied to offline privacy 
infractions. When the medium has shifted online, however, the application of 
supposedly well-settled principles has been difficult. This difficulty, at least 
with respect to the privacy torts, is a result of privacy traditionally being a 
function of physical space and location (Abril, 2007, p. 12; Solove, 2008, 
p. 1131) demonstrated by the idea that one’s home is where he has the great-
est expectation of privacy. But the dependence on spatial determinations is 
detrimental to the application of privacy torts on the Internet, more specifi-
cally social media, because the web transcends space (Abril, 2007, p. 19).

Further, this social media space has created expectations about privacy that 
differ from what traditionally has been considered acceptable. These expecta-
tions are based on “the anonymity of the multitude, and assumptions about 
the presence of their intended audiences,” which Abril (2008) calls a “com-
plex conception of privacy rooted in the perceived entitlement of selective 
anonymity” (p. 77). Taking this view into account, the expanse of the social 
media network is such that it gives users the illusion that the private informa-
tion they provide on these sites is protected from invasions.
PRIVACY AND SOCIAL MEDIA
The use of social media by both young people and adults in the United States 
continues to grow. In fact, the number of adults using social networking 
sites increased by almost 600% in the four years between February 2005 
and September 2009 (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith & Zickuhr, 2010, p. 17). With 
data demonstrating increased social media usage, the question remains as to 
what, exactly, constitutes social media. According to Correa, Hinsley, and de 
Zúniga (2010), social media are digital and Internet tools that have little to do 
with traditional media. Instead “it provides a mechanism for the audience to 
connect, communicate, and interact with each other and their mutual friends” 
(Correa et al., 2010, p. 248). Other scholars define social media more broadly 
than just networking sites, to include blogs, wikis, user-generated media, 
and forums (Schrock, 2009). Researchers Boyd and Ellison (2008) provide a 
more complex three-prong definition of social media:
We define social network sites as web-based services that allow individu-
als to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, 
(2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and 
(3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within 
the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from 
site to site. (p. 211)
However broadly or narrowly defined, social media are about interaction 
or the ability of users to form networks and otherwise mingle with others 
they know or have just met. Boyd and Ellison (2008) assert, “What makes 
social network sites unique is not that they allow individuals to meet strang-
ers, but rather they enable users to articulate and make visible their social 
networks” (p. 211).
Not only have social networking sites enabled users to communicate with 
others, but these media have “blurred” the boundaries between what is a 
reasonable expectation of privacy and what is not (Abril, 2007; Cohen, 2008;

Jasmine E. McNealy
Gelman, 2009; Sprague, 2008). Inherent in social media is the display of 
connections and communication. Social media like Facebook, Twitter, and 
LinkedIn require users to create profiles and input identifying information. 
This information may be as benign as a name or username, to more specific 
information like geographic coordinates. For the most part, users are able 
to choose the type of information, and the accuracy of the information they 
provide. Individuals are then able to connect with “friends” both real and 
imagined, or “follow” others whose status updates, or tweets, they find inter-
esting. Users may then send messages, chat, view user-generated media, and 
otherwise interact using the Web site as a medium. This display of informa-
tion, be it in the form of a Facebook wall, Twitter feed, or a connection on 
LinkedIn are, for the most part, open to public viewing. Of course, each of 
these sites has privacy settings by which a user can restrict access to their 
information. The default setting, however, is to allow public viewing of this 
information. And yet, Internet users continue to flock to these Web sites and 
disclose their private information.
Studies of information disclosure on social media sites have found that us-
ers appear unconcerned about the amount of information they disclose (Gross 
& Acquisti, 2005; Young & Quan-Haase, 2009). Gross and Acquisti (2005), 
for example, found the majority of the college student respondents to their 
survey displayed personal information on their Facebook profile including 
their birthdate and address, and an image that made them identifiable. Young 
and Quan-Haase (2009) found that although Facebook users disclosed the 
personal information as indicated above, they were concerned about privacy. 
To express their concern, the majority of users in the study had changed the 
privacy settings on their Facebook profile to “friends only” (p. 268).
Predictors of those who will make changes to their profile’s privacy set-
tings include having a large number of friends with private profiles, making 
frequent changes to a profile, as well as having more mainstream tastes with 
respect to cultural items such as favorite books, music, and television shows 
(Lewis, Kaufman, & Christakis, 2008). But changes to privacy settings may 
also be a result of a user’s understanding of threats to their privacy, as well as 
the user’s familiarity with the site’s privacy settings (Debatin, Lovejoy, Horn 
& Hughes, 2009; Grimmelmann, 2009). Those more familiar with a site’s 
privacy settings are more likely to use them (Debatin et al., 2009; Tuunainen, 
Pitkanen & Hovi, 2009).
But the reason for the failure to change one’s privacy settings on a social 
networking site may be as simple as laziness. Krishnamurthy and Wills 
(2008), for example, found that 99% of Twitter users kept the default privacy 
settings, which allow their name, followers, location URL, and biographical 
information to be public. Even when Twitter users took measures to protect

their information by setting their profiles to private, their communications 
may still be disclosed (Meeder, Tam, Kelley & Cranor, 2010). Meeder et 
al. (2010) investigated the leaked tweets of over 5 million Twitter users 
with their profiles set to private. Their study found that 4.68% of users with 
protected accounts had at least one tweet that was retweeted, and thereby 
exposed to others outside the users’ control (p. 6). These users may have 
been unaware that their tweets were retweeted because instead of using the 
Retweet function on Twitter, many re-tweeters would simply cut and paste 
the tweet. Despite the lack of privacy, Twitter continues to grow.
Grimmelmann (2009) provides three reasons for social media users’ 
continued interest in and posting on these sites in spite of the threat to their 
privacy. First, social media users perceive safety in the large number of other 
people online (p. 1161). Social media usage has continued to grow (Lenhart, 
2009). As of September 2010, Twitter, for example, boasted 175 million 
registered users, and 95 million tweets written per day (“Twitter,” 2010). 
Facebook tallied 500 million active users (“Statistics | Facebook,” 2010). The 
sheer number of those on social media could influence a user to believe that 
someone looking for them would be searching for the needle in the haystack.
Secondly, the design of social media sites is such that they make users 
believe that they are in a private space (Grimmelmann, 2009, p. 1162). 
According to Cohen (2008), networked spaces, like those in social media, 
can be analogized to “home,” where the individual has the “freedom of 
movement.” Home is where “we can move from room to room, we can 
speak our minds and read whatever interests us, we can pursue intimacy 
in relationships” (p. 195). Similarly, in social media spaces, users create a 
profile, invite friends over, communicate with others, and do things typical 
for the home setting. Moreover, users can personalize their profiles, adding 
images, video and other applications.
Finally, the connections made on social media sites create the belief in 
users that they are in a community of similar people, all of whom they know 
(Grimmelmann, 2009, p. 1162). According to Gelman (2009), social media 
users do not protect their privacy more because they view their social net-
work as still undefined. Users may expect their networks to grow as they add 
friends and connect with more people. This is one of the incentives created 
by social media: that users will be able to connect with offline friends and 
associates. Debatin et al. (2009) found that the majority of social media us-
ers saw the benefits of using social media as outweighing the risks to their 
privacy. The perceived benefit is that in disclosing more information, users 
may attain more connections.
According to Lewis et al. (2008), online privacy and the disclosure of 
information can be characterized as following a familiar pattern. First, the

boundary between what is public and what is private is undefined and there 
are debates over appropriate boundaries. The next stage is perhaps important 
to understanding the current state of privacy law with respect to social media. 
Abril (2008) views the social media privacy debate as being between digital 
natives and digital immigrants. The divide between these two camps emerged 
in the work of Palfrey (2007) and was published in the Harvard Business 
Review. Digital natives are those who have always used the Internet and Web 
capabilities to communicate. Digital immigrants are those of an older gen-
eration who have had to become accustomed to using digital media. Digital 
natives’ view of privacy is complex and based on the idea that they should 
be protected, at times, from the unintended consequences of their information 
disclosures (Abril, p. 77). The digital immigrant’s conception of privacy, on 
the other hand, is rooted in the knowledge that the Internet is open to anyone. 
Therefore, Internet users should take more control over their personal infor-
mation, although that is difficult in a place where an individual’s personal 
information may be disclosed by another entity (pp. 77–78).
In the second stage of the Lewis et al. (2008) pattern, the users of online 
technology began to feel the consequences of the blurred boundaries of public 
and private information. “Users venture too far into public space with private 
details, and the consequence is a crashed party, a lost job opportunity, or—at 
the extreme—sexual assault or identity theft” (p. 96). Recent legal decisions 
demonstrate that the privacy in social media may now be at a consequential 
stage. The courts are now deciding whether social media users should expect 
privacy in the information they post online.
APPLYING THE REASONABLE 
EXPECTATION TO SOCIAL MEDIA
According to Sprague (2008), “new forms of communication require a shift 
in attitudes to accepting the idea that just because few people could access in-
formation does not mean it is no longer private even on the Internet” (p. 408). 
Such a shift would seem to run contrary to traditional privacy jurisprudence, 
which provides the greatest protection to activities and information that an 
individual took affirmative steps to keep safe. To evaluate whether the courts 
are shifting attitudes toward expectations of privacy with respect to social 
media it is instructive to examine their decisions.
In many of the cases found, a party to a lawsuit has requested access to the 
social media profile, or documents connected to the profile, of the opposing 
party to the lawsuit. In Dexter v. Dexter (2007), the court used a woman’s 
MySpace posting, which indicated she used drugs in her home while her

child was present to decide the best interest of the child in a custody case. 
In Ledbetter v. Wal-Mart Stores (2009) the federal court granted a subpoena 
for the Facebook and MySpace profiles of two people claiming to have been 
injured at a Wal-Mart store.
Similarly, in McMillen v. Hummingbird Speedway (2010), a Pennsylvania 
trial court ordered the plaintiff in a personal injury case to produce the login 
and passwords to his Facebook and MySpace accounts. Bill McMillen sued 
Hummingbird Speedway after he was injured during a stock car race. Mc-
Millen claimed he was injured after being rear-ended by another driver on 
the Hummingbird track. Hummingbird requested discovery of McMillen’s 
Facebook and MySpace profiles to investigate McMillen’s claim that his in-
juries caused him to lose the ability to enjoy life. In particular, Hummingbird 
wanted information on a trip that McMillen had made to the Daytona 500 and 
a fishing trip (p. 2).
The court granted Hummingbird’s motion for discovery, finding that 
McMillen’s communications on the social networking sites were not confi-
dential communications for which there was a privilege against disclosure 
(p. 6). In its opinion, the court noted the terms of service for both Facebook 
and MySpace warn the user that any information provided to the sites may 
be disclosed if requested by law, as well as for other reasons (pp. 7–8). Ac-
cording to the court, this is evidence that communications on these sites are 
not considered private. Further, any information provided or communicated 
through these social networking sites is information delivered to a third party. 
Individuals have no expectation of confidentiality with respect to information 
disclosed in the presence of a third party (p. 9). Meaning, social media users 
should not expect to keep the information that they post on these sites private.
More recently, in Romano v. Steelecase (2010), another personal injury 
case, a New York appellate court ruled that the postings on a plaintiff’s 
social networking profiles were not privileged, and therefore available for 
discovery. To make its decision, the court examined cases decided outside its 
jurisdiction including Ledbetter v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2009). These cases 
led the court to decide that the material included on Romano’s social media 
profiles was discoverable in spite of the privacy controls she had configured 
to restrict access to her page. Further, the court found that any risk to privacy 
was outweighed by the benefits of allowing a defendant ample evidence by 
which to defend themselves (p. 655).
The parties in the cases above sought protection for information they 
posted on various social media sites. The courts in all of the cases found no 
violation of privacy in allowing an adverse party to access the social media 
postings. In the cases involving physical injuries the courts used the rules of 
evidence as a basis for ruling the individuals’ social media communications

were not privileged. In evidence law, certain relationships, such as doctor-
patient or attorney-client, are privileged, and therefore the parties to those re-
lationships are not required to disclose that information except under certain 
circumstances. The relationship between an individual and a social media site 
does not rise to the level of that between a doctor and her patient. The dis-
closure of information to a third party for which there is no privilege vitiated 
both McMillen’s and Romano’s claim of privacy in their social media posts.
As part of her argument against allowing discovery of her social network 
profiles, Romano asserted protection under the Stored Communications Act 
(SCA), which prohibits third-party Internet Service Providers from disclos-
ing electronic communications. Buckley Crispin asserted similar protection 
for his online communications that were subpoenaed during the course of his 
lawsuit against Christian Audigier, Inc. (Crispin v. Christian Audigier, 2010). 
Crispin sued Christian Audigier claiming the company had used and sold his 
artwork for use without his permission. Unlike the Romano court, the Crispen 
court found the plaintiff had a personal right to privacy in his stored com-
munications on social networking sites (p. 22). But the court distinguished 
between private messages sent on social networking sites, and postings like 
those found on a user’s Facebook wall. Private messages were protected from 
review, but the public postings could be available for subpoena depending on 
Crispen’s privacy settings (p. 78).
Indeed, placing more restrictive settings on her MySpace profile could 
have saved Cynthia Moreno and her family the pain of embarrassment and 
ostracism. Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel, Inc. (2009) arose as a result of a local 
newspaper publishing a post the college student made on her MySpace page. 
Moreno wrote and posted, “An Ode to Coalinga,” a rant about how much she 
hated her hometown as well as negative comments about the city and some of 
the people who live there. Although Moreno removed the post only six days 
after publishing it, the principal at the high school that her sister attended 
obtained a copy and passed it along to the local paper, which published it in 
the letters to the editor section along with Moreno’s full name. This resulted 
in death threats to Moreno and her family, forcing the family to move out of 
town and to close their 20-year-old business.
The Moreno (2009) court affirmed the trial court’s ruling that Moreno 
failed to prove invasion of privacy. The court asserted that in posting the ode 
to her MySpace profile, Moreno engaged in “an affirmative act [that] made 
her article available to any person with a computer and thus opened it to the 
public eye” (p. 1130). Moreno’s publication of her poem on the Internet, 
therefore, excluded her from having any reasonable expectation of privacy 
in that posting.

SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY UNDER THE LAW
Recall Justice Harlan’s two-part test for establishing whether an individual 
had a reasonable expectation of privacy. First the court must examine whether 
the individual demonstrated that they expected privacy in the information or 
activity in which they are engaged. Second, the individual’s expectation must 
be one that society would find reasonable (Katz v. United States, 1967). With 
the exception of Crispen, the courts in the cases above found no expectation 
of privacy that would be acceptable to society. Therefore, although the social 
media users may have that thought their postings were private, the courts 
have rejected their claims. Further, even affirmative steps taken to protect pri-
vacy on social media, such as the placement of restrictions on who can view 
an individual’s profile, did not create a reasonable expectation of privacy.
Sprague (2008) asserted the application of the law needs to change to re-
flect new modes of communication, specifically, with regard to the idea that 
the possibility another person might view Internet communications does not 
render those communications public. The cases detailed above demonstrate 
that courts have not shifted their views on privacy in this manner. In Moreno, 
for example, the court found that the woman’s MySpace postings were open 
for public viewing; therefore, she had no expectation of privacy in that post-
ing. It did not matter that she, like the many people using social media, may 
have been speaking solely to her friends.
Perhaps the courts’ ignorance of the culture of social media provides the 
rationale for a decision like that in Moreno. Although it is well settled in 
offline situations that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy 
in information and activities exposed to the public, recall that in the digital 
world, the disclosure of information has benefits. In social media, information 
disclosure is how people connect with friends and nurture those friendships.
This may demonstrate Abril’s (2008) concept of the debate between digital 
natives and digital immigrants with respect to privacy. In the cases above, the 
courts, populated by those who would be in the generation of digital immi-
grants, have asserted their conception of privacy. That is, information is only 
private when you control it. If McMillen (2010) wanted to control his private 
information, according to the court, he would not have posted his pictures to 
his MySpace and Facebook profiles. This disclosure of information to a third 
party vitiated his claim of privacy because he was no longer really in control of 
his information. Likewise, Romano (2010) had lost control of her information 
even when she seemingly asserted control by restricting access to her profile.
These court opinions seem to assert the only recourse for those wanting to 
protect their privacy while using social media would be to either limit their

interactions, or withdraw from using these media altogether. The choices 
seem extreme with regard to personal liberty. Such a choice definitely ap-
pears to reject Cohen’s (2008) analogy of the networked space to “home.” 
If home is the place where an individual is most free and, for the most part 
devoid of consequences, the cases demonstrate the consequences of using 
social media and may give people pause with respect to using this liberty. 
The courts appear to define social media as a public space where individuals 
have less of an expectation of privacy than they do in their physical homes.
CONCLUSION
Privacy in the age of social media remains as complex as privacy in the off-
line world. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has provided some guidance, 
no exact definition exists as to what is public or private in the physical world. 
It is well settled, however, that no reasonable expectation of privacy exists in 
information or activities observable in public. The term “public” is, perhaps, 
the cause of the difficulty in applying offline privacy principles to online 
situations. Although recognizing that some of their personal information is 
available to a large number of people, social media users assert that the in-
formation shared on social networking sites is private. The courts continue, 
however, to reject the idea that society is prepared to recognize a privacy 
interest in information available to many others. Although an increasing num-
ber of individuals are now making their homes online, recent court decisions 
demonstrate that they will not receive the high level of privacy protection that 
they would within their own four walls.
The third stage in Lewis, Kaufman, and Christakis’ (2008) pattern of pri-
vacy on the Internet is awareness (Lewis et al., 2008, p. 96). In the aware-
ness stage, users themselves make affirmative steps to protect their privacy. 
As a result, a boundary forms that delineates the public and private spaces. 
The court decisions above, and those that are sure to follow, should raise 
awareness among social media users that although the normative expecta-
tion would be to retain a privacy interest in some of the information they 
have posted on social media, the current standard rejects this expectation. 
Awareness does not, however, necessarily make the lines between the pub-
lic and private clearer.
In the future, courts may continue to use the digital immigrant view of 
privacy, and only extend the reasonable expectation of privacy protection to 
social media users who have attempted to control their information. In the 
alternative, the courts may take the digital native view of privacy, and extend 
the reasonable expectation of privacy protection to whatever information that

social media users believe to be private. The courts may also take a view of 
online privacy that straddles the center between these two extremes. This 
would require the courts to examine the context of the information disclosed, 
including the perceived benefits of disclosing the information and the custom 
and usage of the information. Such an examination recognizes that no clear 
line exists delineating the private from the public. Until the courts begin to 
perform this kind of analysis in social media privacy cases, users should re-
frain from posting information that, if disclosed, would harm their interests.

Chapter Sixteen
Tweets, Blogs, Facebook 
and the Ethics of 21st-Century 
Communication Technology
James Benjamin
Mark Twain (1897) said that “Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs 
to.” The great American humorist touched on a salient point about the nature 
of people—we are interested in ethics and ethical situations. The rhetorician 
Weaver (1964) put it another way, writing:
Man universally considered has cognitive, aesthetic, ethical, and religious facul-
ties or means of apprehension. The first is the inquiring faculty, which gives him 
knowledge; the second, which is essentially contemplative, enables him to enjoy 
beauty; the third enables him to determine the order of the goods and to judge 
between right and wrong; and the fourth which is essentially intuitive, gives him 
glimpses of his transcendental nature and his destiny. (p. 85)
Indeed, for centuries rhetoricians have acknowledged the role of ethics in hu-
man communication. Some, like Weaver (1964), have argued that rhetoric is 
inherently moral. Others, like Plato, have argued that rhetoric is immoral in 
Gorgias (Plato, n.d.). Still others, like Aristotle (n.d.) in Book I of his Rheto-
ric, have contended that rhetoric is amoral.
In a similar vein, some would argue that communication technology is 
moral, that it is a bastion of citizen journalists and has led to the democra-
tization of information (Arts Institute, n.d., para. 1). Others argue that com-
munication technology is immoral, that the Internet is a cesspool of sexual 
predators, political renegades, and cyber-businesses aiming to bilk consumers 
(Fletcher, 2010, para. 5). Still others claim that communication technology is 
amoral, that it is a tool like a scalpel that can be used by surgeons as readily as 
by serial killers (Elmore, 2009, para. 4). In the age of social media, contem-
porary communication technologies used for tweets, blogs, Facebook friend-
ings, and YouTube postings have led us to ask whether the established ethical

standards are adequate and appropriate to address the unique features of these 
social media forms. This chapter explored the ethics of such 21st-century 
modes of communication. First, the philosophical foundations of ethical 
judgment were explored. Next, the chapter considered how ethics relates to 
social media of tweets, blogs, and Facebook. Finally, the chapter explored the 
implications that social media have for the field of ethics in communication.
ROLE OF ETHICS IN HUMAN COMMUNICATION
There are many established precepts of ethics. Some of the most often 
mentioned are hedonism, the Golden Mean, utilitarianism, and Kant’s cat-
egorical imperative. An ancient ethical perspective is based on hedonism. 
This view, advocated by ancient philosophers like Aristippus (c. 435–360 
B.C.E.) and Epicurus (342–270 B.C.E.), claim that a person’s moral respon-
sibility is to embrace pleasure and to avoid pain. “It is impossible to live a 
pleasant life without living  wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible 
to live wisely and well  and justly without living pleasantly” (Epicurus, 
n.d.). As applied to social media for developed nations like the United 
States, this concept has been labeled “cyber-hedonism.” The Economist 
described the situation in this way:
To the dismay of idealists, young people in many countries seem to be giving 
up the political struggles of previous generations and opting instead for a sort 
of digital nirvana, reveling in a vast supply of movies, music, instant commu-
nication and of course, sexual opportunity. One appealing thing about cyber-
hedonism is that, compared with politics, it’s less likely to attract the authorities’ 
attention. (Virtual Pleasures, 2009, p. 54)
Another well-known ancient ethical perspective is Aristotle’s “Golden 
Mean.” This concept is that, when confronted with a moral choice, modera-
tion or the mean described in his Nicomachean Ethics, is ideal (Aristotle, 
n.d.). A clear application of this principle in human communication on the 
Internet can be found in the concern for excessive use of social media. There 
is a concern that the overuse of social media actually impairs face-to-face 
interpersonal communication; therefore, perhaps children should be restricted 
in their use of social media. According to Aristotle’s standard, it is appropri-
ate to restrict excessive access but not to prohibit access to social media.
In addition to the ancient philosophies, there are more contemporary 
principles of ethics. Principal among these is the ethical principle of utili-
tarianism as expressed by Jeremy Bentham (1784–1832) and John Stuart 
Mill (1806–1873). The principal ethical concept of utilitarianism is secur-

Ethics of 21st-Century Communication Technology 
273
ing the greatest good for the greatest number or as Bentham (1977 version) 
wrote, the “fundamental axiom, it is the greatest happiness of the greatest 
number that is the measure of right and wrong” (p. 393). When we apply 
this principle to communication technology, it is reasonable to conclude 
that Utilitarianism supports net neutrality. That is to say, all Internet traffic 
should be treated equally rather than restricted on the basis of content, site, 
or other irrelevant factors.
The Categorical Imperative of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) asserts that 
one should “act as if the principle from which you act were to become 
through your will and universal law of nature” (Kant, 1785). In other words, 
the ethical laws are unconditional and cannot be changed by circumstances. 
So, for example, a principle like the Golden Rule (“Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you”) does not depend on circumstances such as: do 
unto others unless it is to your advantage to do otherwise. Applied to contem-
porary social media, this view would hold that it is immoral for WikiLeaks 
to publish classified U.S. government documents regardless of the fact that 
Julian Assange is Australian (Harrell, 2010), the server is located outside the 
United States (Singel, 2008, p. 3), and that Assange did not personally down-
load the documents from the U.S. Government archives (Martinez, 2010).
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND ETHICS
The preceding pages touched on the centuries-long examination of ethics. 
The ethical issues involved in communication technology usage can be clas-
sified into three categories: the creator of the messages (source), the receiver, 
and the critic.
Sources
The regard for professional behavior and its linkage to ethics lead to the devel-
opment of codes of ethics for professional communicators. A clear example can 
be found in The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) statement of the code 
of ethics for professional journalists. The following precepts are used
as a resource for ethical decision-making by professional journalists. Seek Truth 
and Report It—Journalists should be honest, fair and courageous in gathering, 
reporting and interpreting information. . . . Minimize Harm—Ethical journalists 
treat sources, subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect. 
. . . Act Independently—Journalists should be free of obligation to any interest 
other than the public’s right to know. (Society of Professional Journalism, 1996, 
para. 2–5)

Honesty, minimization of harm, and rejection of inappropriate influence are 
clearly related to values traditionally incorporated in guides to ethical behav-
ior and adapted to communication codes of ethics.
Examination of the SPJ Code of Ethics as well as the International As-
sociation for Business Communicators (n.d.), the National Communication 
Association (n.d.), the American Advertising Federation (1984), and the 
Public Relations Society of America (2000) reveals that these formal codes 
are directed at the creators of messages. For example, the Public Relations 
Society of America’s code of ethics mandates that public relations profes-
sionals should advance the “free flow of information” based on the ethical 
principle that “[p]rotecting and advancing the free flow of accurate and truth-
ful information is essential to serving the public interest and contributing to 
informed decision making in a democratic society” (Public Relations Society 
of America, 2000, PRSA Code Provisions para. 1). The principle, intent, and 
guides are all directed toward the creator or source of the communication.
Another observation about these codes is that they do not specifically ad-
dress the social media formats. Therefore, the ethical codes of conduct should 
be amended to remedy this problem and to provide better guidance in light 
of the development of social media as widely used means of communication. 
In November, the Texas Education Agency adapted its code of ethics for 
teachers by amending Standard 3.9 to read: “The educator shall refrain from 
inappropriate communication with a student or minor, including, but not lim-
ited to, electronic communication such as cell phone, text messaging, email, 
instant messaging, blogging, or other social network communication” (Texas 
Education Agency, 2010). Individual organizations have also recognized that 
they must address social media. For example, the University of Maryland 
Medical Center requires that:
Postings and comments about the Medical Center or on Medical Center sites 
shall be ethical, honest and accurate. Postings which contain mistakes are to be 
corrected promptly. . . . The Medical Center will reply to comments, blog posts, 
emails, etc., when appropriate in its judgment. . . . Medical Center staff members 
are to avoid conflicts of interest and to disclose conflicts that might arise when 
making or responding to postings or comments. (University of Maryland Medi-
cal School, n.d., para. 1–5)
These codes are known and followed by professional journalists but citizen 
journalists may not be familiar with them or may not adhere to such ethical 
codes of conduct and responsible reporting.
While there have been calls to update codes of ethics to reflect the unique 
characteristics of social media, to date the professional associations have 
not changed their codes of ethics to directly reference social media. While it

may be argued that the underlying principles apply to social media as well 
as the traditional media formats, there are features, like removing erroneous 
blog entries to correct for accuracy of information that were not a part of the 
traditional media formats of communication.
Receivers
While codes of ethics underscore the role of ethical decision-making for the 
communication creator, the principles of ethics also apply to the audiences 
or receivers of the communication. As Anderson (1984) reminded us, “as 
we think of ourselves in the role of receiver we certainly wish to exercise 
our own judgment. We want and need to assure ourselves that actions urged, 
means employed, and effects eventuated will meet our ethical requirements” 
(p. 220). In other words, human communication ethics should also be consid-
ered from the standpoint of media consumers.
Receivers must apply ethical judgment to the truthfulness of the communi-
cation they encounter. Austin (1970) wrote, “It is fundamental in talking (as 
in other matters) that we are entitled to trust others, except insofar as there 
is some concrete reason to distrust them. Believing persons, accepting testi-
mony, is the, or one main, point of talking” (p. 82). Beyond caveat emptor, it 
is the ethical obligation of receivers to apply critical thinking to the messages 
they encounter. This issue is particularly complicated by the new communi-
cation technologies in which there is often no editorial oversight, no external 
accountability for the accuracy of the content of the messages, and the cloak 
of anonymity and screen names that may mask the source of the messages. 
Misinformed and ill-informed sources may use social media unintention-
ally to deceive receivers. Unscrupulous marketers may deliberately mislead 
others in schemes like “pump and dump” that use “stock tips” to inflate the 
value of stock they own so that they can sell before the bubble bursts and the 
price falls back to an accurate market value. Clearly, efforts to instill critical 
thinking skills must also be informed by ethical dimensions of the content of 
social media.
Receivers are also ethically obliged to apply the tests of credibility to the 
sources of the information. As Tucher (1997) wrote,
On the Web, journalism, para-journalism, and pseudo-journalism don’t just 
coexist; they invade each other, through the handy online device of the hyper-
text link. While a newspaper editor can—theoretically, anyway—maintain iron 
control over the content of her four sections’ worth of newsprint, no online 
journalist, no matter how scrupulous his own standards, can predict where his 
readers might daisy-chain their way. Even the most respectable news site has the 
potential to launch the unwary surfer straight through the looking glass. (p. 35)

James Benjamin
Studies of social media formats indicate that credibility does not rest solely 
with assessing the credibility of the source. Instead, a variety of factors intrin-
sic to the message and the media, such as appearance and navigability, be-
come indicators of credibility. As Warnick’s (2003) review of three national 
studies concluded,
clear indication of authorship, sponsorship, and credentialing is not ubiquitous 
on the Web. For some genres of sites such as entertainment, sports, and travel, 
users appear to attend much more closely to site functionality and usefulness 
than to source identification in choosing a site. (para. 24)
Thus, our criteria for the evaluation of credibility of social media must extend 
beyond the more traditional factors of source credibility and ethos used for 
decades in the assessment of communication.
Abdulla, Garrison, Salwen, Driscoll, and Casey (2002) used twelve factors 
of credibility in a comparative analysis of traditional newspapers, television 
news and online news: trustworthiness, currency, bias, fairness, complete-
ness, objectivity, honesty, up-to-date, believability, balance, accuracy, and 
timeliness. They concluded that “the dimension of currency, timeliness, and 
up-to-date remain important in the credibility of all three news media stud-
ied” (p. 19). However, they also noted differences:
Newspaper credibility is seen to be based in balance, honesty, and currency. 
. . . Television news credibility is anchored in fairness. . . . trustworthiness, 
accuracy, objectivity, completeness, believability, unbiased, and honesty as 
elements of fairness. . . . For online news to be credible, it must be trustworthy 
and believable. It must also be accurate, complete, balanced and fair, and hon-
est. (pp. 19–20)
Thus, consumers weigh different factors of credibility differently depending 
on the media format. Similar studies should be conducted on news web sites, 
for blogs, for Twitter, and for other forms of social media.
So far, ethics and human communication have been considered from the 
perspectives of the source and the receiver, but there is a third perspective 
needed to complete this examination. Ethical dimensions of human com-
munication should be considered from the meta-communication perspective 
applied by critics.
Critics
Media critics serve an important role in the analysis, interpretation and evalu-
ation of communication. The role of media critics goes beyond critiquing 
messages. As Hart (1997) noted, “the good critic never studies a particular

Ethics of 21st-Century Communication Technology 
277
text simply because it exists but because it promises to tell a story larger than 
itself” (p. 25). Media criticism that tells a larger story, that is designed to ac-
complish more than commenting on the reporting of specific stories, seeks to 
make larger social and cultural commentary in order to reveal “the common 
bonds and sense of identification that are the glue holding together a society 
or culture as well as the basis for visions that lead people to try to fulfill their 
hopes and dreams” (Zarefsky, 2006, p. 386).
To assess and evaluate the uses of modern social media requires updated 
standards of ethics. Just as communication law has had to evolve as a result 
of the unique characteristics of the Internet, so too must the ethical standards 
of media criticism evolve to incorporate the unique feature of social media. In 
the following section, the ethical implications of some of these social media 
forms will be explored.
SOCIAL MEDIA
“Social Media,” wrote Kaplan and Haenlein (2010), “is a group of Internet-
based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations 
of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of User Generated Con-
tent” (p. 61). While the specific forms of social media are constantly evolv-
ing, three of the forms were explored as a basis for developing a concept of 
the ethical implications of social media: Twitter, Blogs, and Facebook.
Twitter
First, Twitter with its short messages called tweets was explored. Tweets are 
short (140 character) text messages submitted to followers from computers 
or mobile devices. While tweets seem similar to personal text messaging, the 
fact that there are followers (often numbering in the hundreds and thousands) 
simultaneously receiving the tweet and a publically accessible archive of 
tweets, makes Twitter more akin to mass communication than interpersonal 
communication.
Some have suggested the earlier ethical standards apply to journalists us-
ing Twitter. Brewer (2010), for example, suggests that accuracy, impartiality, 
fairness, offence (i.e., sensitivity to audience expectations), integrity, and 
privacy should be the guiding ethical principles for Twitter journalism. He 
notes that while these are the traditional ethical standards “[t]he platforms 
and conduits change, but journalists must remain true to editorial values ad-
justed only to reflect societal developments” (para. 29). However, there are 
several characteristics that must be taken into consideration in revising the

James Benjamin
traditional ethical standard. One of these is the 140-character restriction that 
limits tweets to about two sentences.
The 140-character limit affects the context of the communication. Reporter 
Loo (2010), described a ruling on a defamation case that involved Twitter: 
The case involved Amanda Bonnen, who rented an apartment from Horizon 
Management Group. Ms. Bonnen used her Twitter account to complain 
about mold in her apartment. Her public tweet read, “Who said sleeping in a 
moldy apartment was bad for you? Horizon Realty thinks it’s okay.” Horizon 
Group Management filed suit claiming that her tweet was malicious, false, 
and damaged Horizon Group Management’s reputation. Judge Diane Larsen 
dismissed the charges ruling that Bonnen’s tweet “is really too vague” and 
“lacks any context” (para. 2–4). It should be noted that tweets now include 
“hashtags” that can be used to provide some limited context. For example, 
preceding a tweet with #kidding may indicate that the author is not serious 
about the content of the tweet, but such tags, if used at all, do not provide suf-
ficiently detailed context that puts the message into anything more than a very 
broad category. A recent deployment of Twitter include “rich detail panes” 
that allow users to include additional information, photos, videos, and other 
information (Twitter.com, 2011, para. 2). Neither of these developments ad-
dress the problem inherent in the 140-character limitation of tweets. For an 
utterance to be judged unethical, as in the Bonnen case of alleged libel, it 
must be considered in context. Since context is inherently restricted in tweets, 
limitation of context is a central characteristic that must be accounted for in 
any ethical standard developed for social media.
In addition to a lack of context, the 140-character limit offers insufficient 
room for qualifiers for the tweet. Since reality is complex, it is difficult to 
accurately report events through a severely limited message length. To ex-
press appropriate nuance requires qualifications that are too often lacking in 
tweets. Both expression in tweets and interpretation of the messages in tweets 
challenge the ethical mandate for accuracy in communication endeavors. Any 
explanation or qualification must be omitted when length limitations are im-
posed. Bailey cited a clear example of the problem. Octavia Nasr, a Middle 
Eastern reporter, was fired by CNN for sending a tweet that read, “Sad to 
hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah…One of Hez-
bollah’s giants I respect a lot” (Bailey, 2010, para. 2). Bailey (2010) quoted 
The Guardian’s, Peter Walker, as commenting, “Twitter, with its strict 140-
character limit, was never going to be the best medium to make a nuanced 
point about Middle East politics” (para. 10). In traditional media, even time 
considerations in television newscasts and space considerations inherent in 
print media are not as severely restricted as a tweet’s 140 characters.

Still another restriction of Twitter is that the 140-character limit restricts 
development of the communication. In traditional media, creators can de-
velop their points and offer support and arguments that the receiver can 
assess. Tweets substitute headlines for insightful articles, restrict messages 
to bold claims without the ability or the need to include carefully developed 
arguments. As Hirschorn (2010) sarcastically observed, “Sarah Palin quickly 
adopted Twitter perhaps because it enabled her to blast forth dramatic proc-
lamations that, given the140-character limit, she couldn’t be expected to 
explain or defend” (p. 64).
Finally, a feature of tweets that must be considered is that they are not only 
short but instantaneously distributed. Instantaneous communication is valu-
able in cases of reporting disasters, but also has drawbacks. Rapidly spreading 
erroneous information leads to communication without reflection. Real-time 
receipt of tweets leads to the expectation for instant response. Under these 
conditions, receivers do not have time to assess the messages they encounter. 
The more followers the sender reaches, the worse the problem becomes.
To develop ethical standards appropriate for Twitter, both limited length 
and instance reach must be considered. These aspects of tweets have a sig-
nificant impact on ethical aspects of Twitter and its impact.
Blogs
Another social media format that requires examination is the blog, short for 
web log, or online web-based journals that contain a series of entries. While 
blogs began as personal logs, blogs have increasingly become public fora 
used by communities to offer political observations and commentaries and 
by businesses to reach potential clients. The blogosphere is a community 
of blogs. “One of the most important features of a blog,” wrote Safko and 
Brake (2009), “is the readers’ ability to interact with the author through 
comments” (p. 167)
Because blog sites are open for comments from anyone, a concern is that 
blog journalism becomes rumor mongering rather than reporting. Basen 
(2009) related the story of the impact of a rumor about the health of Apple 
founder Steve Jobs on the stock price of the company. On October 3, 2008, 
a citizen journalist named “johntw” published a story on CNN’s iReport 
claiming that Apple CEO Steve Jobs had suffered a severe heart attack. He 
claimed that the story came from a reliable source who had asked to remain 
anonymous. As the story became re-posted and re-tweeted, the price of 
shares of Apple dropped dramatically, losing $5 billion in a space of a few 
minutes. When an official spokesperson denied the veracity of the report,

it was pulled by CNN’s iReport and the price of Apple shares recovered 
as quickly as they dropped. An investigation showed that johntw was a 
teenager who made up the story for fun. In the era of print media, before 
the advent of social media, reporters and editors who published unverified 
stories from anonymous sources risked their careers for such a violation of 
journalistic ethics. In the era of social media, however, the johnw blog re-
port is used as an example of the value of the media because the false story 
was quickly corrected by other bloggers.
Blogs, then, foster a world of news stringers but not a world of solid report-
ing. The open, unedited blogosphere becomes a particular ethical problem 
when personal blogs become conflated with the public sphere of news. Blogs 
are interactive and the content of a blog develops and evolves by readers 
posting comments and additions to the blog site. This raises another ethical 
consideration unique to this form of social media. Since the source of the blog 
is responsible for maintaining the blog site, where does the ethical responsi-
bility reside for the content of the comments? Inaccurate, misleading, uncivil, 
plagiarized, or libelous comments are clearly the ethical responsibility of the 
commentator, but what responsibility rests with the blog source to edit or 
alter the site’s comments? Some argue that the blog is sacrosanct and should 
never be tampered with except through corrections added as separate entries. 
The problem with this approach is clearly illustrated by the example of Miller 
(2010), when he wrote:
Some bloggers consider it immoral to withdraw an error because it would mean 
covering up their mistakes. They are willing to admit the mistake. But fixing it 
would be a coverup. Here, I think we need to consider a shift from rule ethics to 
thinking about the consequences of our actions. (para. 16)
Examination of blogs requires the development of ethics that incorporates 
social media characteristics. Ethical standards must consider the conflation 
of the personal and the public spheres. As media sources, blogs also give rise 
to concerns for both the form and function. Ethical standards for blogs must 
address the responsibility for the content of blogs, the need for accuracy, and 
respect for freedom of speech.
Facebook
Facebook is a social network site with more than half a billion active users 
(Facebook.com, 2011, para. 1). Facebook allows registered users to post 
updates, photographs, videos, and links that can be viewed on the user’s 
Facebook page. In addition, it allows invited “friends” to interact. Facebook 
pages also allow users to endorse (“like”) posts, pages, and articles. A record

is made of the Facebook “like” selections and conveys the endorsements to 
the user’s friends. Unlike Twitter, Facebook requires users to register with 
one’s real name. Once registered, the site requires a profile to be created and 
the user can then invite others to connect as a “friend.” All such invitations 
must be accepted by the other user before the accounts are linked for interac-
tion. As a globally popular social media, Facebook has two important ethical 
ramifications. One problem is the matter of cyberbullying and the second 
concern is the issue of information security. Each of these will be considered 
in more detail.
Cyberbullying is a social phenomenon in which social media are used to 
intimidate victims. Smith, Mahdavi, Carvalho, Fisher, Russell, and Tippett 
(2008) defined cyberbullying as “an aggressive, intentional act carried out 
by a group or individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly over 
time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or her self” (p. 376). 
Cyberbullying is not rare. According to the Pew Internet and American Life 
Project, nearly one-third of all teenagers who use the Internet have been 
victims of such harassment (Lenhart, 2007, p. 1). In Manassas, Virginia, a 
16-year old student created a Facebook page and posted pictures of other stu-
dents with lewd captions. The student was arrested on misdemeanor charges 
of harassment and her computer was seized. In addition to the legal charges, 
the 16-year old faces expulsion from her school (Gordon, 2011). The issue is 
particularly relevant to Facebook because a survey of undergraduate students 
indicated that Facebook was the most frequently used medium for cyberbul-
lying (Walter, Sockman, & Koehn, 2011, p. 35).
While some parental organizations propose limiting Internet access for 
minors, ethical standards for using Facebook must go beyond attempting to 
restrict Internet access. We should protect young people by educating them 
on the ethically responsible use of social network systems and on protect-
ing themselves in the electronic social environment (Erdur-Baker, 2010). 
Protection against the threat posed by cyberbullying should also include 
counseling about online behavior that puts students at risk. Sengupta and 
Chaudhuri (2010) found that unsolicited stranger contacts and bullying in-
creased significantly for teenagers who uploaded pictures of themselves for 
public viewing, who disclosed personal information such as the school they 
attended, their phone numbers, who flirted with unknown users, or who 
visited online chat rooms (p. 289).
Facebook not only requires its users to register with a personal profile, but 
users and friends often voluntarily post extensive personal data about them-
selves on their accounts. While this information may be restricted to specific 
individuals, establishing such restrictions is complicated and confusing. As a 
result, Facebook is a rich mine of information about millions of people—their

lives, their friends, their views, and their preferences. The availability of this 
wealth of information raises a wide range of ethical concerns about online 
information security from employers scanning the lives of their employees, 
exploitation of marketing data, potential violations of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and other privacy regulations.
Facebook does not validate its registration applications which, in turn, 
creates additional ethical implications related to anonymity, cyberstalking, 
and identity theft (Light & McGrath, 2011, p. 303). For example, McMillan 
(2011) reported a case of a hacker offering 1.5 million stolen Facebook user-
names and passwords. Scam artists can use such access to compromised ac-
counts to conduct nefarious activity like inviting friends to link to malicious 
software under the guise of a “hilarious” video. Clearly there are important 
ethical implications for social networking sites like Facebook. According 
to Michelfelder (2001, pp. 219–130), ethical safeguards against such social 
media abuse can be classified into three categories: technological approaches, 
self-regulatory solutions, and legislative approaches. The following analysis 
examines Facebook in light of each of these categories.
Technological safeguards can be built into social networking sites. For ex-
ample, Facebook’s software can be designed to protect against misuse and the 
system can clearly explain how to use the available technological safeguards, 
but Facebook opts instead for weak and confusing privacy technology. In a 
complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2010, the Electronic 
Privacy Information Center joined several privacy interest groups in outlining 
a history of Facebook altering its service in ways that harm user security (In 
the Matter of Facebook, pp. 28–31). The complaint charged that the actions 
of Facebook cause injury to its users
by invading their privacy; allowing for disclosure and use of information in ways 
and for purposes other than those consented to or relied upon by such users; caus-
ing them to believe falsely that they have full control over the use of their infor-
mation; and undermining the ability of users to avail themselves of the privacy 
protections promised by the company” (In the Matter of Facebook, p. 33).
Technological safeguards alone are not sufficient to address the ethical con-
cerns of social network sites.
Self-regulation relies on individuals to identify and implement protection. 
Here, again, Facebook seems to deliberately make self-regulation of privacy 
settings difficult and confusing. For example, Light and McGrath (2010) 
traced progressive redesigns of the privacy menu in Facebook from July 2008 
to February of 2011. Their analysis concluded that Facebook “made it more 
difficult to manage privacy” with each redesign (p. 302). Clearly Facebook 
is seeking to obfuscate rather than clarify in order to defeat self-regulation

Ethics of 21st-Century Communication Technology 
283
of privacy. Neither technological safeguards nor self-regulation provide suf-
ficient protection of privacy.
Finally, there is the legislative approach to protecting people from unethical 
behavior in social networking sites by strengthening legislation that protects the 
privacy of online information. While legislation for a Privacy Bill of Rights is 
being drafted, the proposed bill does not deal with protection of Facebook post-
ings (Pike, 2010, p. 28). To address legislation that will affect Facebook, Marc 
Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, testified 
before Congress that section 2701 of the Stored Communication Act should 
be strengthened to more strenuously restrict social network sites like Facebook 
in sharing user data with third parties unless the user specifically opts into the 
release of such data (Online Privacy, Social Networking, and Crime Victim-
ization, 2010, p. 50). Only by combining strong technological safeguards with 
vigilant self-regulation and more stringent regulation can the users of social 
network sites be protected from unethical behavior.
The ethics of human communication clearly applies to social media. Ig-
noring the ethics of social network systems has serious consequences. Since 
social media constantly evolve, the ethical standards and their implementa-
tion must also evolve through technological enhancements, improved self-
regulation, and strengthened legislative regulation.
CONCLUSION
Ethics should not be seen as a finalized field. Like the U.S. Constitution, 
underlying principles must be constantly adapted to meet new developments 
in human communication. The examination of communication ethics and 
social media leads to several conclusions that can guide the development of 
new protocols and practices in communication ethics. First, social media put 
the power of mass media into the hands of all. While the “old” media ethics 
were designed for a select group of news reporters operating in an edited 
environment that held publications accountable to their readers and com-
munities, social media allow everyone to act like a journalist and to reach a 
worldwide audience. This has advantages in that journalism is democratized, 
but it also has ethical implications. Sources should be held accountable to 
ethical standards they may not be familiar with nor concerned by. Receivers 
should be sensitive to factors of message analysis and source credibility vital 
in social media.
Second, social media blur the traditional lines between public and personal 
communication. When communicating directly with another, we are in an 
interpersonal relationship that allows us to learn about the other so that we

James Benjamin
may over time assess both the messages and the person creating the messages. 
When we move to public communication, the source is communicating with 
many people, and our communication impinges on the public sphere. Here 
receivers may not be in a position to know the source and may not have the 
time or resources to assess the veracity and intent of the messages. Our ethical 
standards must acknowledge the reach inherent in social media’s conflation 
of the personal and the public spheres people inhabit.
Third, the instantaneous and lasting qualities of social media affect the eth-
ics appropriate to these forms of communication. As we noted, social media 
are marked by their immediacy. As soon as the entry is posted, as soon as the 
tweet is sent, it is in the potential purview of the receiver. We feel compelled 
to be both first and fast. This does not encourage consideration in composi-
tion nor reflection upon receipt of the message. Our ethical standards must be 
adapted to take instant communication into consideration.
The ever-changing nature of new human communication media com-
plicates the development of ethical theory. Because technology changes 
so rapidly, scholars and communication professionals have difficulty in 
adapting the principles and codes before the media evolves and requires 
yet further adaptation. No sooner is a standard considered and adapted than 
the standard requires further reworking to meet the evolution of the media. 
Nonetheless, communication professionals should be dedicated to seeking 
new standards of ethics that incorporate these features. Communication 
educators should be dedicated to teaching ethics to communication con-
sumers. Finally, communication critics must be dedicated to applying ethi-
cal standards appropriate to social media while respecting the appropriate 
standards of the earlier media.
