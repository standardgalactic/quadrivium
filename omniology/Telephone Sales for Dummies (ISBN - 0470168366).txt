Dedication
To salespeople — the backbone of any successful company. You
possess the power to make your companies grow and prosper.
Nothing is accomplished without someone making a sale some-
where at sometime. Be proud you are a salesperson. Your profes-
sion is noble and essential to the world.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I thank the team at Sales Champions and Real Estate Champions,
my two sales training companies. Without your dedication to
helping salespeople reach their full potential in selling, this book
wouldn’t be possible.
Special thanks must be expressed to my senior management team
Don Cunningham, Director of Coaching; Dan Matejsek, VP of
Marketing; Roger Marti, Sales Manager; and Julie Porfirio, VP
of Operations. You all take on extra duties while I am focused
on writing. Also, to Rachelle Cotton who typed and proofed the
manuscript . . . thanks.
Thanks to Tracy Boggier, Acquisitions Editor, Chad Sievers and
Georgette Beatty, Project Editors, and Sarah Westfall and Carrie
Burchfield, Copy Editors, for taking on this project and keeping us
all on schedule. Thank you to Betsy Sheldon who did a masterful
job of taking my writing, thoughts, and ideas and converting them
into the For Dummies format that you can learn from and enjoy.
To the home team — my wife, Joan, my son, Wesley, and my
daughter, Annabelle, you make the challenges of a sales career
all worth the effort. Without you all, the rewards of sales and
success would have diminished value.

Telephone Sales For Dummies 

Introduction
“A
born salesman.” You know the expression. People love 
to slap that label on those who seem to come naturally 
to selling. Maybe you’ve been told you were born to sell at some
point in your life:
 When you were 6 years old and persuaded the guy in the 
ice-cream truck to buy your lemonade, your Mom said it.
 When you got the prize for selling the most candy for the
school fundraiser, the other kids said it.
 When you talked your way from a C to a B, your English lit
teacher said it.
 When you turn your trash into treasure by selling it on eBay,
your spouse says it.
But whether you call it the power of persuasion, the capacity to con-
vince, or the wit to win over — I’m here to tell you this: Dynamite
salespeople aren’t born. They’re the result of commitment, disci-
pline, and the drive to learn the best and smartest ways to earn the
business of their prospects.
Take it from me: I’m the penultimate salesperson. Sure, sales is my
passion, my path to career success. Sales has helped me attain and
even exceed my financial goals and has allowed me to realize my
most-valued life dreams. But I didn’t start out that way.
When I started out in the field, I was the youngest, greenest sales
agent in my office. Some tried to convince me I’d fail, that I didn’t
have what it took. However, I put forth a lot of effort in those first
few months. During the day, I’d work through breakfast, lunch, and
dinner to make as many calls as possible. And after hours, I’d review
my performance and numbers and devise the most effective 
methods for selling over the phone.
Within months, I earned the title of top salesman for the entire 
division. My progress continued, and I earned my first million at
the ripe old age of 32. In 1998, I launched my coaching company,
Sales Champions, to help others become top-notch salespeople
and reach their career goals and life dreams.

I wrote Telephone Sales For Dummies for the same reasons I started
my company — to guide others to develop their full potential as a
sales professional and achieve their highest aspirations.
About This Book
This book is a how-to guide for gaining the skills and knowledge 
you need to become a champion telephone salesperson. You can
also use it to acquire the organizational habits, time-management
techniques, personal motivational strategies, and positive 
attitudes you need to rise to the top.
Telephone Sales For Dummies isn’t a book of theory but of 
“real stuff” that works. I’ve packed it with proven programs and
processes, tested techniques, and tried-and-true skills, strategies,
and scripts.
In classic For Dummies fashion, the book is designed to give you
easy access to the precise information you’re looking for. You can
read the book from cover to cover or zigzag your way through, flip-
ping to the content you need when you need it. You can keep the
book close at hand and turn to it for a fast reference — whether by
combing the Table of Contents or Index or zeroing in on a particular
chapter section, sidebar (those gray shaded boxes), or list.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book as easy to use as possible, the following 
conventions are followed throughout:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
Note: Some Web addresses break across two lines of text. In
such cases, no hyphens were inserted to indicate a break. So 
if you type exactly what you see — pretending the line break
doesn’t exist — you can get to your Web destination.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an
easy-to-understand definition. I also use italics for emphasis
once in a while.
 Bold font highlights keywords in bulleted lists or identifies 
the action parts of numbered lists.
 I indent and italicize all scripts used throughout the book. You
can use them verbatim or with minor tweaks to increase your
sales success.

What You’re Not to Read
I understand your life is busy, and you want to read only the need-
to-know information. If you’re on a fast-track learning mission, you
can safely skip the sidebars. Shaded gray boxes, sidebars serve as
examples or support material. They’re meant to reinforce and illus-
trate a concept (giving you a little extra oomph), but aren’t critical
to your understanding of the concept.
Foolish Assumptions
When I wrote this book, I assumed a few things about you, my dear
reader. I assumed that you picked up this book because you want 
to improve your phone-sales skills. I didn’t assume, however, that
you’re a working person with the title of telephone salesperson. You
may be
 A real estate agent
 A financial consultant
 An insurance agent
 An account executive for a business-to-business product
 A volunteer for a phone fundraising campaign
 A telemarketer
 A customer service professional
 A savvy businessperson who understands that telephone-sales
skills are valuable to success in any job
No matter your title or your job, you want to elevate your game
and improve your sales numbers.
How This Book Is Organized
I divide Telephone Sales For Dummies into six major parts to help
you find just what you need as quick as possible. The content is
organized so that you can choose to read only the topics that inter-
est you — or the entire part. Check out the Table of Contents or the
Index to find your area of interest, and then go to the chapter that
addresses the topic. At a glance, here’s what you can find:
Introduction
3

Part I: Picking Up on 
Telephone Sales
Part I presents an overview of the most important matters to 
master in order to achieve telephone-sales success. I begin with 
a walk-through of the phone-sales process in Chapter 1, and then
follow with ways to increase your sales and income in Chapter 2. In
Chapter 3, I untangle Do-Not-Call regulations for easy understanding.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork 
for Telephone-Sales Success
Phone-sales success requires plenty of groundwork before you place
a finger on the first touchtone. And a game plan is the best founda-
tion for a champion sales effort. Chapter 4 takes you step by step
through the process.
Ready to get in touch with future clients? Chapter 5 covers the 
what, who, when, why, and how of prospecting for business. And 
in Chapter 6, I show you how to overcome that common malaise:
call hesitance. I identify this malady and reveal my sure cure. And
because time is your most valuable asset, Chapter 7 addresses
another challenge to your sales endeavors: time management.
Part III: You Make the Call!
The call is the core of telephone sales. And (no surprise) making 
a call that closes is a complex process — complex but easily mas-
tered if you have a handle on the process and the players. Part III
contains the how-to instructions for executing a winning call, start-
ing in Chapter 8 with tips to get past the gatekeepers that guard
your prospect’s phone access. In Chapters 9, 10, and 11, you dis-
cover how to craft an attention-getting opening, how to ask and
listen before you tell and sell, and how to ask the questions that
garner the best answers. Finally, Chapter 12 shows you how to
smoothly shift into the delivery of your sales presentation.
Part IV: Going for the Close
So close to the close! This stage is one of the most critical parts of
the sales process — the spot that can make or break the sale. This
part contains the secrets to overcoming close barriers: Chapter 13
covers the most frequently cited objections and presents my six-
step process for defusing them. In Chapter 14, I show you how to
Telephone Sales For Dummies 
4

lock in your prospect’s commitment and close the order now. And
Chapter 15 shows how you can turn a failed close into a future sale.
Part V: Increasing Your Sales
This part contains tips to help you read your clients and adapt
your behavior to increase your odds of closing, no matter the
prospect’s behavioral style. In Chapter 16, I cover different selling
styles and show you how to make the most of yours. Recognizing
your prospect’s communication style over the phone can be a chal-
lenge, but Chapter 17 gives you the tools to meet that challenge
head on. And finally, I give you some tricks of the trade for staying
motivated through discipline, attitude, and ongoing training and
professional development in Chapter 18.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book ends with the famous Part of Tens 
(drum roll, please). In mine, you get three tip-packed chapters 
to help you polish your delivery when talking on the phone, steer
clear of do-not-use phrases, and abide by the ten commandments
for phone-sales success.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book a bit better, you can rely on icons in
the book’s margins. The icons are similar to little signposts pointing
out the important info.
This bull’s-eye icon points out little-advertised nuggets of knowledge
that are certain to give you an edge in increasing your telephone
sales.
This icon denotes critical information that you really need to take
away with you. Remember these points if nothing else. They address
the issues that you come across repeatedly in your phone-sales
efforts.
Consider this icon the flashing red light on the road to making 
a sale. When you see a Warning icon, you know to steer clear of
whatever practice, behavior, or response I indicate.
Introduction

“Did you hear the one about the salesman and the . . .?” Not to
worry. When you see the anecdote icon, expect to find a G-rated,
short personal story from my own archives of experience — one
that is meant to drive home the point I’m making in the text.
Where to Go from Here
To get the lay of the land of telephone sales, Part I is a good place
to start. This part introduces you to the big picture and the big
benefits of acquiring and honing your telephone-sales skills.
From there, you can use the Table of Contents or the Index to pick
out the topics that most interest you. If you’re new to sales, you can
feel comfortable jumping to and fro in any order that suits you —
without feeling that you’ve missed something.
If you’ve got some years of professional experience under your
belt, you may want to jump to Part V. Here, I address how to get
yourself to the next level through an understanding of sales psy-
chology and continuing development through ongoing education.
No matter where you start, you can find tons of valuable info that
you can use to elevate your sales performance.

Part I
Picking Up on
Telephone Sales

In this part . . . 
T
elephone sales may focus on the sense of hearing,
but you have to be able to see the big picture. The
chapters in this ﬁrst part offer a wide-angle view of what
it takes to make it to the top — valuable information
whether you’re brand-new to the business or a veteran
who’s won your share of sales awards.
From the best ways to set up for sales calls to sureﬁre
strategies to “work” those calls to following up to secure
the sale, I outline the crucial steps to making sales calls
in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 reveals the four ways guaranteed
to increase sales and income and other tried-and-true
tactics for achieving the success you desire. Lest I leave
you with the idea that the route to phone sales success is
a walk in the park, I lead you into the land of “Do Not Call”
in Chapter 3. The regulations that affect telemarketing are
full of twists and turns, but trust me, they’re not as impen-
etrable as you may think. Be sure to read Chapter 3 if you
have any questions about these latest regulations. (And
who doesn’t?)

 Staying motivated
T
he surge in telecommunications technology has changed the
very nature of — well — communication. From anywhere in 
the world, you can reach out and touch someone. Or text-message
them. Or at least leave a voice mail. You can even arrange a confer-
ence call so that several parties meet remotely, or set up a videocon-
ference and put faces to voices. There’s no doubt about it — you’re
in the era of the telephone. (And if you have any doubt, just listen to
the orchestra of cellphone rings in the middle of a shopping mall, or
count the drivers who whiz by with a phone attached to their ears.)
So it’s natural that the telephone is the most important tool at the
disposal of any salesperson.
If you’re a sales professional, you may not consider yourself to be in
telephone sales — maybe because your job title isn’t “telemarketer”
or because you don’t work in a call center. But in today’s world, all
salespeople rely on the telephone to be successful in their work.
In any sales scenario, the first contact with a potential customer is
likely to be via the phone, even if follow-up is face to face. Although
more and more commerce is carried out on the Internet, few 
business-client relationships are forged without regular phone con-
tact. The days of the door-to-door encyclopedia peddler are long
past. In fact, it’s not unusual for, say, a printer in the Midwest to
serve a magazine publisher on the West Coast, executing business
entirely over the phone.

Now is the time for all sales pros to step up to the phone and master
this amazing sales tool. This chapter gives you a quick rundown on
telephone sales and serves as a jumping-off point to this book and 
to the world of telephone sales.
Plugging In to Telephone Sales
Telephone sales is much more than simply picking up the phone and
asking someone to buy something. Telephone sales is the primary
sales communication system for any salesperson on the planet. The
formula for telephone-sales success is complex if not complicated.
It’s more involved than just picking up the receiver and punching in
a phone number. Just as any sales effort requires planning, prepara-
tion, and practice, telephone sales demands much effort before you
can count on closing sales at regular intervals.
Are you telephone-sales material?
Do you have to be a certain “type” to succeed at phone sales?
Nope. In order to be a good telephone-sales pro, you must be organ-
ized, detailed, persistent, and able to read people and situations in a
single call. Although individuals with certain qualities may be faster
to adapt, I believe that anyone with the drive and desire to succeed
can do so.
Sure, those outgoing types who are fearless about meeting new
people, who love a challenge, and who thrive on competition may
dive right into the sales pool and find the temperature just right. 
But phone-sales success demands more than personality. Whether
you’re the classic “sales type” or you have other qualities valuable
to effective selling, all salespeople benefit from honing their knowl-
edge and sales skills, as well as maintaining a positive attitude.
(Check out Chapter 2 for more on what a thriving telephone-sales
pro needs.)
Obeying the Do Not Call laws
Critical to any salesperson who uses the phone to sell is a clear
and thorough understanding of national and state Do Not Call laws.
More than 150 million people have registered to have their names
and phone listings added to these Do Not Call lists, which blocks
them from most telemarketing calls.
Salespeople who sell products or services direct to consumers —
life, auto, and health insurance; long-distance or cable services; real
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
10

estate; replacement windows; and myriad others — must be aware
of the Do Not Call registries and adhere to their restrictions.
If you sell business to business, you don’t have to worry about the
no-call issues, because businesses can’t register with national or
state Do Not Call lists.
If you’re caught breaking the Do Not Call law, the federal fine is
$11,000 per offense — not an inconsequential amount of money. 
For more information about the Do Not Call Registry and state laws
involving telemarketing restrictions, read Chapter 3.
Gearing Up for Winning Calls
Great telephone-sales calls don’t just happen, whether you’re a vet-
eran or a newbie. A lot goes into a sales call before your fingers ever
hit that first touch button. You master all the details about the serv-
ice or product you sell, and you research everything possible about
the person or company you’re calling. You practice your delivery,
prepare for questions or challenges, and — last but not the least —
you prepare yourself! This section gives a quick 4-1-1 on preparing 
to make your calls. (You can also check out Part II for more in-depth
info.)
Studying up for call success
When it comes to making the most out of your telephone-sales
career, the same advice that applied to your classes in high school 
or college still applies in the workplace: Keep up with the daily
assignments, and the big tests seem to take care of themselves.
Each day, when you arrive at the office, set aside some time for
reviewing your schedule. Then study up for each and every phone
call. Review your notes to refresh your knowledge, and if you dis-
cover some gaps, do what you must to fill them, whether digging
deeper into your files or researching on the Internet. (Refer to
Chapter 4 for more advice.)
Prospecting smarter, not harder
Telephone sales demands work, but you can manage your
prospecting work in an efficient way. Prospecting, the heart and 
soul of telephone sales, simply means you invest effort consistently
seeking new customers.
Chapter 1: Calling All Sales Professionals! 11

The following tips can help you work smarter and increase your
effectiveness and productivity when prospecting. You can also
check out Chapter 5 for more info.
 Batch like calls together. By addressing similar questions, chal-
lenges, objections, and related issues, you gain a smoother flow
and greater efficiency. For example, call all small, independent
tire dealers in one batch, and then call the attorneys in the next
batch, then the dentists, and so forth.
You also can batch by sales stage — make all your presentation
appointments at the same time, all your lead follow-up calls
together, and all client-referral calls in a group.
 Recognize your limits. No one can stay on the phone for eight
hours straight. To maximize your production and maintain a
high energy level, plan a 10- or 15-minute break after each hour
of calling. Stretch, grab a snack, and get back for another hour
of calls. An hour to 75 minutes is really the maximum time to 
be calling back-to-back.
Overcoming sales aversion
No matter how experienced or how successful, all sales pros are
stricken with sales-call aversion from time to time. Sales call aver-
sion is when you try to avoid, delay, or divert your prospecting and
lead follow-up calls to later or never. A few examples may be bore-
dom, stress, or fear of calling. The best cures, however, work for
almost all forms of sales aversion.
Sticking to routine is a healthy way to control the condition. If you’re
in the habit of setting aside every morning for calls, you likely have
an easier time moving forward even if you’re temporarily unin-
spired. For more prescriptions for sales aversion, check out
Chapter 6.
Making the most of your time
Telephone salespeople are plagued by time burglars. Taking a bite
out of time crime is critical — and it’s not so hard after you identify
what is preventing you from using your time wisely. The following
two culprits can steal a lot of valuable time. If you can eye them and
make them a priority, you may be able to increase your productivity.
 Low-return activities: Held captive by service calls and paper-
work duties, the sales pro watches as valuable opportunities
slip away. Zero in on the high-return activities and make them
your number-one priority. In sales as in other disciplines, 20
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
12

percent of your efforts bring in 80 percent of your successes.
So determine what comprises the 20 percent and make it 
a priority. This, combined with a zero tolerance for time 
stealers, is certain to control time loss.
 In-between call breaks: They may be a few seconds — but
sometimes these breaks are three, four, or even five minutes.
However, these seemingly small breaks can add up. For exam-
ple, say you spend five hours making 100 calls a day, with three
minutes between each call. If you reduced your in-between call
breaks from three minutes to one minute, you could make an
additional 200 calls per day.
Instead of allowing these thieves to steal from your telephone-sales
success, zero in on the high-return activities and make them your
number-one priority. (Read Chapter 7 for more ways to free yourself
up to become a more productive member of your sales force.)
Making the Call
The time has come — you’re ready to pick up the phone and sell!
What to expect? Well, at the most fundamental level, you may antici-
pate a yes, a no, or a maybe. That outcome depends largely on what
you do from the moment you connect with the prospect until you
ask for the business. This section looks at the possibilities.
Reaching the right person
The gatekeeper is the person who guards the decision maker — 
the person you want to talk to. You must be able to get past the
gatekeeper to make the sale. If you’re stopped at the administra-
tive assistant’s extension, a few tricks are at your disposal:
 If you know the decision maker’s extension, call before or after
the close of business and hope the assistant isn’t at work —
and the boss is.
 Call someone else within the company, apologize, and say you
were transferred to the wrong extension. This individual may
transfer you to the exec’s direct line.
 Based on the assistant’s extension, try keying in a number
higher or lower. For example, if the assistant’s extension is 234,
it’s highly probable that the decision maker’s extension is 233
or 235. (If you don’t reach the executive, then try one of the
other two ploys.)
Chapter 1: Calling All Sales Professionals! 13

For more hints and tips for reaching the decision maker, read
Chapter 8.
Opening moves
The opening is the most critical step in charting your sales call. Your
first seven seconds determine whether you get the sale. You don’t
want to leave it to chance. Put in time to craft a powerful, stop-
in-your-tracks opening, and then practice it until it’s perfect.
Every successful opening is built on certain key components. 
You must also avoid certain words or phrases like the plague (see
Chapter 20). Chapter 9 is a great source of statement templates, as
well as other ideas for winning greetings.
Asking the questions first
The best way to sell is through questioning. A masterful telephone
salesperson focuses on the questions because well-crafted ques-
tions elicit answers that can be used to guide the successful sale.
Without an effective questioning process, you can’t determine
desire, motivation, needs, wants, expectations, ability, authority,
time frame, competition, priority of needs and wants, and a host of
other factors that influence the buying decision.
After you get the answers to these questions, then it’s your turn 
to talk. You have a lot to consider in crafting and preparing your
questions. Chapter 10 provides more on questioning.
Hear this!
Salespeople are cast as talkers, not listeners. But all good sales 
pros — and especially telephone-sales pros — are successful because
they listen, not because they talk. The better you are at listening, the
more you learn about the prospect and the better equipped you are
to sell to the prospect when it comes your turn to talk.
But listening is more than shutting your mouth. In order to pick 
up and process valuable information that helps you to shape your
sales presentation, you have to be proactive — even if you feel like
listening is a passive exercise.
Learning to love the pause and making peace with the awkward
silence are two important skills that make you a master listener.
Chapter 11 shows you the way to these and other valuable tricks.
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales

Delivering dynamite presentations
The sales presentation is where you do the talking. And if you’ve 
followed all the other guidelines to phone-sales success, a powerful
presentation is likely to follow.
Presentations that turn a prospect into a client don’t happen by
accident. Ever watch those courtroom dramas on TV? You know, the
ones where the lawyers chase down every last detail and anticipate
every move from objections to surprise witnesses? That’s the kind
of work that results in a winning sales presentation. And if you pre-
pare your presentation as if it were your closing statement to the
jury, you’re well on your way to success. For more advice, turn to
Chapter 12.
Closing the Deal
If you do an effective job throughout the sales process, the close
is merely the natural — and successful — ending to your effort.
Closing does require careful attention, as much preparation as any
other step of the process, and an artful reaction to any last-minute
objections. This section shows what you need to do for a successful
close.
Dealing with objections
You know you’ve reached savvy-sales status when you come to
welcome objections from sales prospects! Because, indeed, objec-
tions are a positive sign — and they signal promising potential for
a sale.
Objections, you see, are evidence of interest. Instead of reading an
objection as a don’t-waste-my-time message, look at it as a please-
please-convince-me-to-buy plea. Chapter 13 spells out, step by step,
how to prepare and respond to objections in a way that transforms
that reluctant prospect into a satisfied customer.
Getting to yes
If you’ve ever read advice about job hunting, you no doubt dis-
covered that you must always ask for the job — even if you’re not 
certain you want it. The same holds true for making a sale . . . except
for the part about not wanting it.
Chapter 1: Calling All Sales Professionals! 15

Oh sure, you can find all kinds of closing techniques and strategies
that you may want to try — and I spell them all out in Chapter 14.
But whatever technique reels in the prospect, you still want to ask
for the sale. Always.
Looking on the no-sale bright side
By handling that rejection in the right way, you may earn yourself 
a client down the road, a glowing referral, or even a sale a lot sooner
than you may expect. Although losing a sale can be a downer, you
can tap into ways to turn this failure into a future success. Read
Chapter 15 for some ways to use this rejection in a positive way.
Keeping Motivated
No matter where your sales career path takes you, staying moti-
vated is critical to your success and growth. Motivation comes 
from within, but it must be nourished from the outside. Begin with
an understanding of your values and your goals and maintain 
them through discipline, attitude, routine, habit, and further 
self-development.
Staying motivated is the picture of the Porsche (or resort in Tahiti,
or mansion in Montana) tacked on your bulletin board. But it’s also
the checkmarks in your day planner, the commitment to your daily
call schedule, and the hours of practice and rehearsing. In short,
your ongoing motivation calls on efforts both grand and humble.
(Check out Chapter 18 for how you can stay motivated.)

Thriving as a Telephone-
Sales Pro
In This Chapter
 Discovering the required traits and skills for phone-sales success
 Applying the Four Probabilities of Success for greater results
 Counting out the four ways to increase your sales
A
little more than a year ago, I was interviewed in a monthly
trade magazine for an international sales association with 
1.4 million-plus members. The interviewer asked me this question:
“What is the very best sales tool currently available to our sales
association members?” When I gave her my answer, she was so
surprised she dropped the phone. I got in a good chuckle, while
she fumbled around for the receiver.
The greatest sales tool for the last 30 years, I told her, remains 
the telephone. I knew she expected me to say, “the Internet,” 
“the Blackberry,” or some other 21st-century high-tech device.
They’re dandy gadgets and certainly aid in organization and lead
generation — but none of them directly helps make a sale. The
telephone is still the best tool with which to convey your sales
message in a personal way — the only tool that allows you to 
inject emotion, urgency, passion, and conviction and enables 
you to immediately address questions and objections and guide
your prospect to action.
However, thriving as a telephone-sales professional takes more 
than a phone. The winning salesperson must have the skills, knowl-
edge, attitude, and habits that make the best use of that tool. In
this chapter, I identify what it takes to succeed — the personality
traits and skills that shape a successful phone pro — and how to
acquire them. I reveal the four components that lead to top sales
achievements, and offer four proven ways to raise your sales 
productivity.

Understanding What You Need 
to Succeed in Phone Sales
The toolkit for success in the world of telephone sales contains 
a variety of instruments. To maximize your potential, you need to
gain command of all of them. The good news? You don’t have to be 
a “born” salesperson in order to shine in your career. Unlike sports
celebrities, blessed with physical build and innate skills, telephone-
sales professionals can achieve stardom in their jobs through dili-
gence, commitment, and development of positive behaviors. This
section explains the most important tool you need and lists helpful
personality traits and skills for telephone-sales pros.
Mastering the primary tool: Words
Every profession has its primary tool and its secondary tools.
Although all tools are important, without that primary tool, the
secondary tools are of little value. Mastering that number-one tool
separates the successful professionals from the rest of the pack,
distinguishing them from the competition and positioning them 
as world-class in earnings, prestige, and recognition.
Words are your primary tool when it comes to achieving success in
telephone sales. I know, I know . . . at the beginning of this chapter, I
say that the telephone is the most important tool. In the case of the
telephone-sales professional, however, the telephone is the means
for conveying your words. The two are inextricably entwined.
For example, my father was a dentist for more than 30 years. He
was, by most people’s definition, extremely successful. He relied
on countless tools: drills, explorers, probes, amalgam fillings, gold
and porcelain fillings, sealants, adhesives, and Novocain. But one
tool was absolutely essential — his skillful hands. Without them,
my father’s efforts would have resulted in a different outcome.
The quality of your words conveyed via the phone is what enables
you to rise to the top of the field in any sales profession. Whether
you’re selling rain gutters, windshield repair, real-estate services,
insurance, or financial services, your ability to thrive — not just
survive — is linked to the mastery of that tool. In Parts III and IV, I
provide tips for mastering the words of your sales calls, from start
to finish.

Becoming a sales star with a few
essential personality traits
Most folks have a pretty clear definition of a “sales type.” You 
know, a real people person who’s not shy about meeting strangers.
An upbeat sort — always seeing the glass as half-full. A tireless 
go-getter. Doesn’t take rejection personally. Lots of tenacity.
I’ve met countless successful salespeople who fit that description.
Indeed, a positive attitude, a social orientation, and a high toler-
ance to rejection are personality traits that definitely serve the
sales professional well. And strong commitment and passion
increase the odds of success. These champions win through 
desire and willpower because of their willingness to pay the 
price. If I’m describing you, then the odds of your success are 
very high!
I understand this type well because my personality is the same.
When I began my sales career more than 20 years ago, I made 
calls for hours to get sales or secure appointments. I was willing 
to walk through a wall of fire to earn an income for my family.
But even if you have less natural drive and a lower tolerance for
rejection, you can still succeed at telephone sales by tapping into
other strengths critical for sales, training yourself to take on certain
personality traits, and avoiding other personality traits. Although
turning into a telephone-sales superstar may be more of a challenge,
you can consistently produce month after month and serve as a
valuable team player. You can create revenue, sales, and measurable
returns on investments for the company and for yourself.
What are some of these traits that serve the telephone-sales 
professional well? They include the following:
 Consistent
 Disciplined
 Enthusiastic
 Optimistic
 Patient
 Persistent
 Stable
 Strong belief in the product or service
Chapter 2: Thriving as a Telephone-Sales Pro 19

Chapter 18 discusses many of these traits and how you can use
them to stay motivated.
Surveying skills that suit a sales pro
Although you can strengthen positive personality traits and break
the negative ones, skills are practices that are learned. The suc-
cessful salesperson must master a number of disciplines, including
those in the following list. (Some are so critical, I’ve devoted an
entire chapter to them.) Check the list to assess your skills in the 
following areas. And if you find yourself lacking, get the training 
you need (check out Chapter 18 for more on training).
 Closing techniques (see Chapter 14)
 Communication
 Follow-up
 Handling objections (see Chapter 13)
 Listening effectively (see Chapter 11)
 Organization
 Phone skills
 Prospecting (see Chapter 5)
 Script-writing (see Chapter 4)
 Time management (see Chapter 7)
One skill deserves special attention: discipline. Now I’m not talking
about having you sit on the time-out chair. Discipline is the ability
to do what you know needs to be done even when you don’t feel
like doing it. This ability helps you acquire the other necessary
skills, and can significantly improve your career and earnings. As 
a speaker and coach of peak sales performers, I consistently observe
that the top salespeople have more discipline, whether conquering 
a new skill, overcoming a challenge, or just attending to the paper-
work and administrative details of their jobs. Discipline isn’t a 
mystery; it’s an act of will.
Achieving Your Goals with the
Four Probabilities of Success
In the world of sales — especially telephone sales — you must be on
a constant quest to understand the odds for success and focus on
the improvement of those odds. With an increase of the odds comes
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
20

improvement of income, reduction in work time, higher conversion
ratios, greater career satisfaction, and a better home life.
One of the secrets to achieving your sales and life goals is conquer-
ing the Four Probabilities of Success. When you can grasp their
direct connection to achieving your dreams and desires, you’re
better able to formulate a plan for your growth. You’re also able 
to put the plan into action and attain the success you desire.
I call these important areas the Four Probabilities of Success,
because when applied, they raise the probability of your increasing
your sales, income, quality of life, and quality of relationships. These
Four Probabilities of Success carry with them the power to trans-
form your bank account, status at work, and personal life. The 
following section leads you through the four.
Identifying the Four Probabilities
What you accomplish is the net result of the proper application 
of the Four Probabilities of Success: knowledge, skill, attitude, and
activities. If you raise any one of these, you increase the chances of
achieving your personal or business goals. You virtually guarantee
your success if you improve all of them.
Knowledge
If you increase your knowledge of the products or services 
you sell, you enhance your income and success. If you gain more
knowledge of your competitors’ offerings, you increase sales by
selling more effectively against the competition. If you learn more
about your customers before they buy, you increase the likelihood
of making more sales for higher dollar amounts. (Chapter 4 has the
basics on doing your homework for winning calls and increasing
your knowledge.)
Skill
Do you have the skills you need to have telephone-sales success? 
If you can focus on just two skills, I recommend the following:
 Sales skills arm you with the ability to convince customers to
take an action (buy your product, for example) or to persuade
them to do it faster. Sales skills include your prospecting, lead
follow-up, qualifying, presentation, objection handling, and
closing abilities.
 Time-management skills increase the time you invest in direct
income–producing activities over production-supporting activi-
ties. Time management is one of the largest challenges for most
salespeople. (Check out Chapter 7 for more info.)
Chapter 2: Thriving as a Telephone-Sales Pro 21

Both of these critical skills require ongoing attention if you want to
increase performance, but each salesperson must work to perfect
many other skills (see the list in the earlier section “Surveying skills
that suit a sales pro”). As you improve your skills, you’ll see the
odds swing more and more in your favor.
Attitude
Most salespeople report that attitude influences their results. The
ability to control and improve your attitude leads to increased sales,
because as a human being, you’re inevitably influenced by outside
forces, which is especially true for salespeople. You’re on the front
line of rejection and a “no” is always a nearby threat. A positive atti-
tude is a choice you make each day. The easiest way to improve
your attitude is to choose it yourself, rather than let other people
dictate it. In other words, be proactive, rather than reactive, with
your daily attitude.
In telephone sales, you run the risk of letting someone on the 
other end of the line influence your attitude. Don’t allow a faceless,
unknown person control the rest of your day because you caught
them at a bad time or they didn’t want what you were selling. Make
a decision today — right now — to improve your attitude. Also,
commit to being the only person you allow to control your attitude.
If you stand around waiting for someone else to improve your atti-
tude, what happens if they don’t show up? (For more about
improving your attitude, head to Chapter 18.)
During my formative years, I watched a mother who chose, each
day, to have a positive attitude when a negative one would have
been easier. My mom was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when 
I was 3. By the time I entered second grade, she had taken her last
step and was confined to a wheelchair. Over the next 35 years, as 
I watched MS ravage her body to the point of total incapacitation, 
I saw that her power was in her attitude. I, like most people who
knew her, didn’t notice the wheelchair to which she was confined.
Her attitude lifted her out of it. Her attitude also raised the 
probability of success for her children.
Activities
When a salesperson focuses on the activities necessary to increase
her sales success, positive things come quickly. Top sales perform-
ers perform activities that bottom sales performers can’t or won’t
do. Top salespeople do more prospecting, lead generation, lead
follow-up, and appointment booking — and end up with more sales.
If you want to increase your probability of success, increase the 
success-producing sales activities. (I go into more detail on direct
income–producing activities in Chapter 7.)

Prioritizing the Four Probabilities 
to maximize success
When considering the Four Probabilities of Success, you must 
prioritize. Two of the probabilities have a larger influence on your
sales growth than the others. You may even call one of them the
“choke point” for most salespeople. Take a moment without read-
ing further (no peeking!) and rank the following probabilities from
1 to 4, with 1 being what you think is the most important and 4
being the least important.
_____ Knowledge
_____ Skill
_____ Attitude
_____ Activities
Before I reveal the correct order, I want to share with you what I’ve
discovered after speaking to hundreds of thousands of salespeople
about the Four Probabilities of Success. Universally, I’ve found that
85 percent rank attitude as number one. Each of the other proba-
bilities (knowledge, skills, and activities) earn top billing from only
about 5 percent of the voters.
A very compelling case can be made for attitude as the top 
priority. You can say that without a proper attitude, nothing posi-
tive will happen. My years of coaching and training have led me to
another conclusion, however: I find that most salespeople have a
good enough attitude to dramatically increase their sales. The true
number-one priority is activities, because most salespeople aren’t
doing the success-producing activities of prospecting, lead follow-
up, and booking enough presentation appointments to drive the
sales they desire.
But you may find yourself faced with the age-old question: Does
your attitude influence your activities more than your activities
influence your attitude? Which way is it for you? For most sales-
people, even top performers, attitude has a greater affect on their
activities than their activities have on their attitude. For the top
salesperson, though, I find that the influence is reversed. To reach
the highest levels in telephone sales, your activities must have
greater influence on your attitude than your attitude has on your
activities. (Chapter 7 has ways to help you use your time well.)
I hear the following from salespeople all the time: “I didn’t feel like
prospecting.” Since when does feeling like it have anything to do
with what you must do? I can tell you I rarely felt like changing my
Chapter 2: Thriving as a Telephone-Sales Pro 23

children’s diapers, but I did it anyway. I rarely feel like skipping
dessert, but it needs to be done if I want to maintain my weight.
If you’re waiting to feel like doing challenging sales activities such
as prospecting, you may be waiting a long time. You may as well
say to a wood stove, “Give me some heat, and then I will put the
wood in.” You must be willing to move activities to the top of the
Four Probabilities of Success and to the top of your daily personal
to-do list.
From activities as number one, attitude is the second most impor-
tant. Knowledge or skills can be next depending on where you are
in longevity and success in your sales career.
Tackling one probability at a time
Although each of the Four Probabilities holds the potential to
create explosive growth in your sales career, focusing on all of
them at once is impossible. Instead, target one or two to work on
right now by answering the following questions:
 Which of these probabilities is the choke point or limiting
step for you?
 Which one would have the greatest positive influence on 
your sales career if you mastered it in the next year?
After you’ve determined the answers, then you know which proba-
bility you must tackle first. You can have positive results in a short
period of time, as little as a few weeks. But to achieve mastery over
each one of the Four Probabilities of Success, you’ll need as much as
a year. The sooner you make a commitment to start, the sooner you
can conquer that one probability — and begin your next 12-month
journey to master another.
Charting the Four Pathways 
to Increased Sales
When you tally what contributes to increased sales, the number 
of choices are fewer than you may think. Sure, you’ve seen ads for
courses and books that claim to reveal hundreds of ways to multiply
your sales. The truth is that all these options for increasing sales
are mere footpaths that fall under four major avenues to increased
sales. Each category carries tremendous power to help you increase
your sales, as you can see in the following sections. Apply them
effectively, and the road to success becomes much smoother.

Growing your number of contacts
A reliable predictor of performance is the number of contacts you
make on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. A salesperson
who consistently achieves his daily contact goal — no matter the
distractions — goes a long way in locking in a successful sales
future.
In the world of sales, numbers do matter. Making a personal com-
mitment to meet predetermined performance standards on a daily
basis separates you from the pack. Your grasp of and attention to
sales ratios is critical to meeting your sales goals — and the first
component of that ratio is contacts to leads. How many contacts do
you need to engage in order to generate one lead? Top salespeople
know the connection between not only their contacts to leads, but
also their leads to appointments and appointments to sales.
I adhere to a narrow definition of contact: a phone-to-phone or 
face-to-face meeting with a prospect who could either purchase
your products or services or refer someone who could. Others may
include hits on a Web site or recipients of a marketing piece as a
contact. Any other definition allows you to delude yourself. Tracking
Chapter 2: Thriving as a Telephone-Sales Pro 25
Chart it — and achieve it
I have a wish for every salesperson I have the privilege of serving, a desire born
out of the best day I’ve ever had in sales in my more-than-20 years in the business.
I woke up early on January 12, 1993. I had just finished my best sales year. I was
in the shower at 6:15 a.m., using that time to review my business plan and sales
ratios in my head. All of a sudden, like a lightning bolt, the realization that I could
make any amount of money I wanted struck me. I knew my sales ratios so thor-
oughly that I could calculate exactly how to achieve any financial goal I set for
myself. It was one of the most empowering feelings I’ve ever experienced: to know
with certainty, less than two weeks into the new year, that I would achieve my
income goals for that year.
My objective that year was to make $250,000 — a quarter million dollars — more than
I made the previous year. And on December 27, 1993, I cashed a $4,700 commission
check that put my annual income in 1993 at $252,000, more than in 1992. The best part
wasn’t the extra income; it was knowing that I had the power to chart my course to 
success — and that I would do it again.
My wish is that every sales professional could realize that this power is within reach.
That sales success — whether measured by income, position, or fulfillment — is
attainable. That by increasing contacts and using other strategies that are part of
the Four Pathways, individuals can truly chart their course.

the results from Web hits and direct-mail lead generation is harder
than tracking the cause-effect relationship between your telephone
contacts, leads, presentations, and sales. When you’re making direct
contact via the phone or in person, you’re also using your personal
sales skills to create urgency, motivation, emotion, and desire for
your products or services on the prospect’s part. You can’t do that
as easily or effectively through your Web site or direct mail.
Using the telephone effectively 
as your method of contact
Most salespeople are more effective selling face to face than over
the phone. At minimum you have to use the phone to book those
face-to-face presentations, so any salesperson must be a master of
the telephone. Some salespeople can conduct the complete sales
process over the phone.
If you’re selling high-ticket, personal, or professional services, as 
do financial planners, mortgage originators, real-estate agents, and
insurance agents, the best strategy is to use the phone to book
personal, face-to-face presentations for your services. However, 
if you’re selling cable television, magazine subscriptions, long-
distance service, or many other products or services that may be
considered more of a commodity, booking face-to-face presenta-
tions is probably an unnecessary step. You’ll be able to complete
the whole sale over the phone, maybe even in just one call.
As a method of contact, the telephone is highly effective. You can
control who you contact and your message. You have the opportu-
nity to convey your message with power, passion, and persuasion.
And I show you how to do so throughout this book!
Upping your revenue through 
the quality of your prospects
A salesperson who makes consistent contacts in a personal manner
and uses strong presentation skills can still suffer from low sales if
the prospect is a poor match for your product. In the following list,
I give you some guidelines on determining the quality of your
prospects.
 The 80/20 Rule: To increase the odds for success, you can
apply the 80/20 Rule — that 80 percent of your effort creates 
20 percent of your results — to your prospecting strategy. The
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
26

rule also dictates that 20 percent of your prospects create 80
percent of your sales. (For more about the 80/20 Rule, see
Chapter 7.) A dynamite salesperson focuses time, effort, and
emotion on the 20 percent that yields the 80 percent.
 The 20/50/30 Rule: Prospects can be further broken down
(from the 80/20 Rule in the previous bullet) with the use of 
a rule I call the 20/50/30 Rule. Around 20 percent of potential
prospects will do business with you easily. They trust and 
connect with you quickly, and their barriers come down easily.
You have to convince about 50 percent of prospects that they
should do business with you. The remaining 30 percent is toxic.
This segment can’t be satisfied. As a group, these prospects
can ruin your sales, motivation, and attitude.
If your compensation is essentially 100-percent commission or a
small-base fee with a large commission incentive, your prospect’s
commitment becomes an even more critical consideration. Why? 
If you expend a lot of time and energy on a person with a low com-
mitment level, that’s time and energy you’re not spending on
prospects who are more likely to buy.
With each prospect, you need to ask yourself: Is this person a possi-
ble sale or a probable sale? Do you have a greater than 50-percent
chance of making a sale, or are the odds much lower than that? In
order to gauge a prospect’s commitment level, you need to ask 
qualifying questions (see Chapter 10 for more info).
My experience is that the larger the order, the lower the odds or
probability of a sale that most salespeople are willing to accept.
You wouldn’t go to Las Vegas and bet more money with longer odds
and expect to win more frequently. The size of the sale shouldn’t
influence the quality of the prospect you’re willing to work with.
Your evaluation of the odds and quality of the prospect can’t be
influenced by your earnings, or you will get burned.
Improving the quality of your 
message: Two theories
Too many telephone salespeople operate on the edge of insanity —
doing the same things over and over but expecting different results.
If you have quality leads, and you’re making the number of contacts
you need daily with the appropriate method of contact (see previ-
ous sections on these topics), the problem is clearly the quality of
your message. It can’t be anything else!
Chapter 2: Thriving as a Telephone-Sales Pro 27

What you say and how you deliver that message matters — a lot.
The careful preparation, practice, and role playing of your presenta-
tion skills can yield amazing results. I believe that for every 15 hours
you spend on the phone, one hour must be invested in practicing
what you’re going to say and role playing.
To improve the quality of your message, you can rely on the two
following theories:
 The X Theory of Success: Becoming proficient at anything
always takes people a certain amount of time, which I call X.
X is different for each person based on your innate talents and
previous experiences and skills. The more innate talent and
previous experience you have, the less practice you need.
For example, perfecting your presentation may take you 100
practice sessions, in order to deliver it with power and convic-
tion, handle objections, and persuade the prospect to sign the
contract. I may have a tougher time perfecting my message. 
I may need to practice 200 times before I get it down pat.
However, the issue isn’t that I take twice as long as you to
achieve success, but that I have an idea of where X is, and 
I’m working toward it regularly.
 The Y Theory of Choice: I now have a decision to make:
Because I know I must practice my presentation 200 times, 
I have a choice of how long I will take, which is the Y Theory 
of Choice in action. I can take ten years, five years, two years,
one year, or perhaps even just six months. If I only conduct my
presentation live, in front of prospects, and don’t practice, it’ll
take me a long time to reach my 200. For example, say I’m 
in front of prospects three or four times a month, I may need
more than five years to complete my 200 presentations. This 
is where too many salespeople miss a critical opportunity to
make a positive choice: They don’t factor in greater frequency
of practice in their equation.
Your success in improving the quality of your message is
determined by crossing the finish line (X) and using the short-
est amount of time (Y) to get there. A top salesperson uses a
combination of presentations to prospects and a larger number
of practice or role-play sessions to advance farther faster when
striving to improve her message quality.

of Telesales Land
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of Do Not Call

 Finding opportunity in the challenges of Do Not Call
T
he rules of telephone sales changed forever on October 1,
2003. That was the day the National Do Not Call (DNC) Registry
went into effect. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) amended 
the previously standing Telemarketing Sales Rules (TSR) to prohibit
telemarketers from calling individuals who place their home phone
numbers on the DNC list. The list has more than 150 million phone
numbers from consumers who have indicated that they want to
limit the telemarketing calls they receive. Registration is voluntary
and must be initiated by the consumer.
For the world of telemarketing, the change was met with concern
and trepidation. Many swore the list would bring about the end of
companies that relied on telephone sales and lead to an economic
collapse. Others were hopeful that the restrictions would signal
doom only for dishonest telemarketers. Consumers who signed up
on the registry were thrilled that the telephone would never again
interrupt a family dinner.
The conscientious phone-sales pro must be aware and adhere to the
newest addition to the Telemarketing Sales Rules. Abiding by the law
takes some attention and extra work. But on the other hand, the new
legislation has also presented some positive opportunities for tele-
phone salespeople. In this chapter, I help clear up exactly what the
Do Not Call Registry restricts and permits, and I point out how the
limitations may even improve the salesperson’s success and quality
of leads.

The registry is managed by the FTC and enforced by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), as well as state consumer pro-
tection agencies; more than 30 states have Do Not Call registries, as
well. To access further information or to receive a copy of the Do
Not Call list, go to www.telemarketing.donotcall.gov.
Coming to Grips with the Rules
The impact of the Do Not Call Registry is neither black nor white.
Although it hasn’t brought down the U.S. economy, the DNC Registry
has certainly thrown some challenges at companies that count on
telephone sales to meet their financial goals. Plenty of scam artists
still manage to stay in business even with the DNC list. And con-
sumers still have to put their fork down to take calls in the evening.
As a salesperson, you need to understand how this law affects you.
This section helps you get a firmer grasp.
Defining telemarketing
The establishment of the Do Not Call list gives households the
chance to opt out of receiving telemarketing calls. But how that list
and the term telemarketing are defined is often misinterpreted by
both telephone-sales companies and consumers.
This is how the FTC defines telemarketing calls:
“The do not call provisions of the TSR cover any plan, 
program, or campaign to sell goods or services through 
interstate/intrastate phone calls. This includes calls by 
telemarketers who solicit consumers, often on behalf of 
third-party sellers. It also includes sellers who are paid to 
provide, offer to provide or arrange to provide goods and
services to consumers.”
In short, telemarketing calls are those that solicit the sales of goods
and services to consumers — even if the business or individual
isn’t identified as a “telemarketer.” Anyone who generates sales
leads and sells to consumers over the phone is covered by the 
rule.
Examining exceptions
You can find a number of exceptions to the Do Not Call Registry
on the books. Exempted are charitable organizations and tele-
phone surveyors. And the politicians who passed the law also
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
30

excluded themselves and political organizations — imagine that!
The following situations also are exempted from the Do Not Call
prohibitions.
Business-to-business sales
For salespeople who sell to other businesses, Do Not Call has 
had zero effect, because the DNC law only encompasses home 
telephone numbers. However, many businesses are home based. 
If a business is home based, then the number is exempt from DNC
coverage. Savvy phone-sales pros make every effort to get a work
phone number for every prospect and client they meet. They’re
steering clear of the Do Not Call restrictions by calling prospects 
at their offices.
Established business relationships
Sales calls are permitted — even if the consumer’s number is on 
the Do Not Call list — if the salesperson or company has established
a business relationship with the consumer within the previous 18
months of the call. Markers of this relationship may be a final 
payment, previous purchase, or recent delivery.
This relationship extends to all company employees and divisions —
meaning you may call a prospect even if the established business
relationship was with another department. For example, if you’re
selling life insurance, and your company also has a mortgage divi-
sion, you can call all the people who originated mortgages from
your company in the last 18 months.
This provision has proven a valuable exemption, allowing sales-
people to call indefinitely without repercussions. When was the
last time you paid your credit card bill? Last month? Technically,
even if you stopped paying your bill for the next 17 months, the 
card company can call to sell you other products without violating
the Do Not Call rule.
Inquiries
If an individual calls about your company, product, or services — 
or even to ask for directions — that’s considered an inquiry. Because
the consumer initiated the contact, he’s just created a 90-day
window that allows you to call back for the purpose of selling to
him. If a prospect hits your Web site and leaves contact information,
that is also considered an inquiry.
Make your contacts within that 90-day period. After that time
passes, you can’t contact people who had inquiries unless they
make another inquiry or give you written permission to call them.
Chapter 3: Brave New World: The Laws of Telesales Land 31

Written permission
You can continue to contact anyone beyond the 90 days after an
inquiry or 18 months after an established business relationship
(see previous sections on these topics) provided that the person
gives you written permission to do so. I recommend, for example,
that real estate agents include a phrase at the bottom of every
open house sign-in sheet: “By providing us with your name and
telephone number, you grant us permission to contact you via the
telephone.” This allows an agent to contact the people who attend
the open house long after the 90-day inquiry period has ended.
Any other salesperson can use the same language and technique.
You must acquire the prospect’s signature on some document 
with the language printed on the bottom. You can also put it at the
bottom of your Web page where the prospect fills out an inquiry for
more info. You can also e-mail brochures and place it on the bottom.
Forming your own list
Most companies that a telephone salesperson would work for would
handle the task of forming a list of individuals. The company would
require each salesperson to daily hand in the names of people that
have requested to be taken off their call list. If you’re an independ-
ent contractor or own your own business, you have to keep track of
this information. I suggest establishing a spreadsheet of the names
and phone numbers of people who have requested to be removed
from your calling list.
You’re required to update your list every 90 days if you’re going 
to call consumers directly.
What to do when customers 
are upset with legal calls
If someone has placed herself on the Do Not Call Registry and then
receives a call from you, the individual may react with anger. She
may not be aware of the key exemptions that allow you to call —
and may not care that the call is legal. You may receive a tongue-
lashing, a hang-up, or even a demand to be taken off your call list
forever. If that happens, your best option is to use the best four-
letter word in sales . . . next!
If anyone asks you to not call again or tells you to put them on your
in-house no-call list, you have to comply with their wishes — even 
if you have an established business relationship or if they provided
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
32

written permission for you to call. If you don’t comply, you may be
hit with the $11,000 fine from the FCC.
Adhering to the Registry’s Rules
Following the rules of the DNC Registry usually isn’t high on the list
for most salespeople. Some salespeople want to bend the rules in
order to get the sale. Be warned though! The DNC Rules are rigid 
and the fines are steep (usually $11,000 a fine). This section explains
what you can and can’t do to make sure that your sales calls fully
comply with the rules of the DNC.
Making the most of what you can do
Despite its restrictions, I believe that the Do Not Call list has pro-
vided a real opportunity for success-minded salespeople. Norman
Vincent Peale, the famous author and speaker, described problems
as the outside wrapping for opportunities. The exterior looks
daunting and impenetrable, but after you break through the tough
exterior, the inside is easy-going.
Although some of the most attractive prospects have opted 
themselves onto the Do Not Call Registry, exemptions such as busi-
nesses, consumers who’ve established a business relationship, and
people who’ve made inquiries to your company pump plenty of
prospects into the sales pipeline. (I cover exceptions to the no-call
rule in more detail earlier in this chapter.) And in many ways, the
rule works to filter out many of the leads that would most likely fail
to produce sales anyway.
Instead of viewing DNC as an expensive, inconvenient barrier that
hampers your ability to make sales contacts, shift your perspective
and treat it as motivation to focus your efforts on the most qualified
leads. Such a philosophy can result in higher close ratios.
Documenting call activity
The new Do Not Call restrictions make it more critical than ever to
document your sales activities: each call, all correspondence, topics
discussed, and outcome of contact. If you intend to use the estab-
lished business relationship and inquiry exemptions to contact
names on the list, you must record a history of delivery of service
to back up your action. Delivery of service is a very broad provision,
and is open to interpretation. If you can make a case that your serv-
ice to the client hasn’t ended, then you may be able to fall under this
provision. The more diligently you document your prospect and
Chapter 3: Brave New World: The Laws of Telesales Land 33

client contact, the longer you can extend the established business
relationship provision.
The best way to document your activity is through the use of your
customer relationship management (CRM) software. Whether you
use ACT, Goldmine, or salesforce.com, document every phone, mail,
or e-mail contact into the software log. You should also get into the
habit of recording the detail immediately after the contact — leave 
it until later and you run the risk of forgetting important details.
Using telephone surveys as a contact method
Telephone surveys are also exempt from the Do Not Call restric-
tions. By conducting a survey, you can approach individuals who
may be good prospects — even if they’re on the list.
This method works only if you refrain from promoting your product
or service, attempt to make a sale, or process an order as part of
that survey phone call. If you don’t refrain from such actions, you’d
be breaking the law.
But the primary reason you’d be conducting that survey is to 
identify potential leads, not to make the sale right away. And that’s
legit — nothing wrong with having an ulterior motive! In the follow-
ing examples, both salespeople can use the info they’ve gathered 
to determine which respondents qualify as good prospects:
 A real estate agent may conduct a phone survey among 
area home owners, asking questions about buying and selling
trends, neighborhood activity, age of homes, and services 
consumers want from a real estate agent.
 An insurance agent can survey folks about their most impor-
tant insurance needs, quality of their current service, and 
types of insurance they currently carry.
But that’s where the phone contact must end! The only way you 
can market to people you’ve surveyed is through going to their front
door or direct mail or e-mail. Then (and only then) if they respond
expressing interest in further information (called an inquiry), you’re
allowed 90 days to follow up with them on the phone. To get their
home and e-mail address, you must ask carefully. One way is to offer
to send them the results of the survey and then ask them for their
address or e-mail address.
You can also pay a personal visit. Yes, instead of sending a direct-
mail piece, you can drop off information and ask for permission to
follow up with a prospect. I have coached numerous salespeople 
in the last few years who have employed the survey method and

techniques with tremendous sales results, so don’t be afraid to get
out there yourself. With this technique, you don’t have to wait on
an e-mail inquiry or a response to a direct mail request. You get the
answer from the horse’s mouth right now!
Tapping into technology to create inquiries
The explosive expansion of the Web as a marketing vehicle pres-
ents another way to skirt the limitations of DNC. Free online reports,
streaming audio files, complimentary newsletters, podcasts, and
blogs are all proving to be effective in generating inquiries and 
harvesting leads that can be pursued via the phone within 90 days.
Another breakthrough for the world of telephone sales is the call-
capture system, a service that provides a toll-free access point to
consumers who want to hear about your company and its prod-
ucts or services. Through marketing efforts, you can persuade the
prospects to dial the call-capture system, and in turn, they listen to 
a recorded message and learn about specific products or services
by entering codes. Because you can record all activity, you have a
great way to measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.
So what are the advantages of a call-capture system to the telephone
salesperson? Oh, let me count the ways:
 After consumers dial into the call-capture system, their phone
numbers are available for you to use for follow-up solicita-
tions — even if their names are on the registry. Because they’re
initiating calls into this system, they fall under the inquiry provi-
sion of the Do Not Call law (which I discuss earlier in this chap-
ter). And because your company is paying for the call-capture
system, you’re entitled to call them. You have 90 days after the
call is captured to follow up to make a sale.
 Many call-capture services offer instant notification for the
salesperson. Within minutes, you receive a phone call, text
message, or e-mail notifying you of the contact and providing
the phone number and information about the caller. This means
you can call the prospect immediately, when she’s most likely
still at the number she called from minutes earlier.
 The call-capture system encourages a high inquiry rate. For 
one thing, people can use the service any time they wish —
which means the system may be gathering leads while you’re
sleeping. Consumers are further motivated to call because they
know they don’t have to talk to a salesperson — no personal
contact and no pressure. In fact, I’ve seen marketing response
rates increase by 75 percent — or even double — when 
call-capture is used.
Chapter 3: Brave New World: The Laws of Telesales Land 35

Knowing what you can’t do
You don’t want to disregard the Do Not Call regulations. If your
product or service is sold directly to the consumer, you can’t
ignore the law. The penalty is too high for the company and for the
errant salesperson. The fine is set at $11,000 per offense. It’s easy
to get nicked because any consumer can turn you in.
Calling from unscrubbed lists
If you cold call from a database of prospects, you must have the list
scrubbed — or cleared of the names of people who have opted onto
the Do Not Call Registry. By law, a call list must be scrubbed every
31 days. To scrub your list, just compare your list of prospects to
the phone numbers on the DNC list and delete the prospects’ 
numbers who appear on the list.
What are the odds that, in the last month, many of the folks on
your list have added themselves to the registry? What would it
hurt to go ahead and call a few numbers from the database? Don’t
even go there. The DNC list contains more than 150 million phone
numbers — and the registry is growing all the time. Don’t risk 
picking up that phone until you’ve updated your list.
Neglecting to establish a Safe Harbor compliance program
A burgeoning sector of the telephone-sales world is dedicated to
assisting sales companies with managing their prospecting lists,
DNC compliance procedures, sales staff training, and other related
Part I: Picking Up on Telephone Sales 
36
The birth of Do Not Call
Laws regulating telephone sales had been on the books for years. But in January
2003, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) amended the Telemarketing Sales Rules
to create the National Do Not Call Registry — a change that has had far-reaching
consequences for the world of telephone sales.
Even today, years later, you can still find confusion and controversy over DNC. The
initial rule was drafted to protect consumers from predatory telemarketing sales-
people selling scam products and services. The original intent was to restrict inter-
state prospecting; for example, you live in California, and you get a phone solicitation
call from someone in Arizona. A number of amendments were added to significantly
expand the reach of the law to include intrastate calling, as well. These amend-
ments caught up a number of service sectors — including real estate agents, insur-
ance agents, financial planners, and many others — that were not part of the
original version.

areas. When navigating the DNC waters, engaging such a service is
a wise move for sales businesses, because it establishes what is
known as a Safe Harbor compliance program and guides the sales-
call practices with a specific set of predetermined standards of
compliance, monitoring, and training.
The Safe Harbor compliance provisions offer some protection from
violation simply through the protocols and oversight of an outside
company. In most cases, if a company is working with a compli-
ance program, the company is less likely to incur a fine if a few
unintentional mistakes are made.
A number of credible companies offer safe harbor compliance pro-
grams. Check out www.export.gov/safeharbor/Sh_Checklist.

Facing the Future of Telephone
Sales in Three Easy Steps
If you think that the Do Not Call list has made life more difficult for
phone-sales pros, you’re right. If you have the attitude that the DNC
list has improved things for good salespeople, you’re also right. With
the right attitude and expectations, you can discover that the DNC
registry has been a blessing to your job.
For example, fewer people are cold calling to generate prospects
than ever before. In fact, the number of direct calls to people who
aren’t on the DNC list has reduced since the advent of the laws. Now,
when you cold call from a scrubbed list (see the previous section for
more on this topic), you’re likely to experience a higher response
rate. In the following sections, I share with you some steps to help
start your journey into the future of telephone sales in the right
direction.
Review your database
For most salespeople, their database is a black hole. Almost any-
thing goes in — and never comes out. Many pour names into the
database and never speak to the prospects again. Some salespeo-
ple may mail something on occasion, but for the most part, these
potential clients are swallowed up and forgotten.
Chapter 3: Brave New World: The Laws of Telesales Land 37

In order to avoid sending prospects into the black abyss, take the
time to review every single name in your database, assessing each
person’s value as a viable prospect or referral source. You should
separate the prospects in your database based on two key factors:
 Timeframe: How soon is the prospect going to take action? How
long before he intends to purchase your product or service?
 Odds of making a sale: How committed is the prospect to you
as a service provider? What are the odds that you can make the
sale? Is the person a possible prospect or a probable prospect?
A possibility is something that happens less than 50 percent 
of the time — and that could be even 1 percent. A probable
prospect would buy your product 50 percent of the time or
more. Great salespeople always evaluate the odds of the game
that they’re playing.
Contact everyone regularly
After you’ve reviewed everyone in the database (check out the pre-
ceding section), you need to contact each one. I don’t mean send
another mailing. The time has come for personal contact. Talk to
them over the phone or face to face, if possible.
This personal contact is an opportunity to discover how the 
individual felt about your service or whether she is satisfied with
your product. Using direct contact is also a chance to call past and
current clients and gain permission to continue to talk to them —
which means if they’re on DNC, you can move them out of the 18-
month established-business-relationship category and put them
under free-to-call-indefinitely portion of your list.
Ask for the business — always
Asking people for their business can be scary. You don’t want 
to appear too pushy or “salesy.” But, my friends, you are in sales!
That is your job: to sell. Prospects are calling, surfing your Web
site, asking for a brochure, or inquiring about your products and
services because they have a need or a want. You’re exactly the
person to provide the solution for them to achieve a better life.
You sell solutions.
Anything is possible for anyone who wants it badly enough. And you
work in the greatest profession in the world — sales. More million-
aires have been created in sales than in any other profession. But in
order to reach that level of success, you must ask for the number,
the appointment, the order, and the referral. Head to Parts III and IV
for details on making the sale effectively.

Just as professional athletes win through preparation
and practice, telephone-sales success requires plenty
of hard work before you place a ﬁnger on the ﬁrst touch-
tone. This part takes dead aim at the preparations required
for a championship sales season. In Chapter 4, I coach
you through creating your game plan and cover all the

person you can be. An outstanding telephone salesperson
knows that prospecting is the pathway to career success.
Chapter 5 covers the how, why, and when of contacting

Even with plenty of preparation, salespeople are suscepti-
ble to a serious telephone sales condition: call aversion.
The prognosis is good for a quick recovery if you follow
my prescription. In Chapter 6, I identify call aversion and

for A-Plus Calls
In This Chapter
 Examining the importance of call preparation
 Taking a few lessons on prospect research
 Cribbing from customer communications
 Improving performance through scripts
Your days in the classroom may be over, but life learning never
ends. Dynamite salespeople read books such as Telephone
Sales For Dummies and enroll in seminars to sharpen their skills.
They also know the value of routine preparation. The best way to
stay at the top of the class is to complete those daily assignments —
in the sales world, that translates to doing your prep work for sales
calls on a regular basis.
Your sales-call homework involves many of the practices you prob-
ably recall from school: research, analysis, review, and rehearsal. It
enables you to stay on course of your long-term goal — graduating
to the top performance level — by successfully performing the
day-to-day assignments.
Preparing diligently for your calls means that you not only do well
on the day-to-day challenges — whether making a sale or building
your appointment schedule — but you’re better positioned to suc-
cessfully handle the bigger tests that your career as a telephone
salesperson inevitably brings. Before you pick up the phone (in
terms of crafting high-quality results-oriented scripts, practicing
those scripts to perfection, and investing the time to research 
the prospect), look over these actions. They can help swing the
results in your favor. Not only does being prepared increase sales,
but it also decreases the time you invest to make the sale along
with shortening the sales cycle. This chapter shows you how to
figure out what you want to achieve, who you want to reach, and
how to get there with a well-constructed script.

Focusing on Your Objectives: What
Do You Want to Achieve?
In order to be successful at telephone sales, or anything in life for
that matter, you need to know what you want to accomplish. You
simply can’t pick up the phone and make that killer sale without
having an idea of why you’re doing it in the first place. Figuring out
your goals and objectives is paramount before jumping into the call.
After you figure out your goals — short, medium, and long range —
staying focused on them isn’t easy. However, before you pick up the
phone for the first time today, you need to pause and look at the
larger picture for the day, week, and month. Doing so helps ignite
the positive energy and keeps you on track. The greater the clarity
of purpose, the easier it is to stay on the path toward your ultimate
destination. This section helps you figure out what your own goals
and objectives are. After you have a clearer picture of them, you
increase your chances of success in telephone sales.
Identifying and assessing 
your achievement goals
When figuring out what you want to accomplish when you’re work-
ing in telephone sales, you want to establish what your own specific
achievement goals are. Your achievement goals are a blueprint for
your actions; they can be broken down into short-, medium-, and
long-range goals. After you establish your goals, you want to revisit
them on a regular basis to assess how you’re doing.
For example, your long-term goal may be to retire comfortably at the
age of 50. In the meantime, short-term goals help you get there. And
your daily preparation helps you achieve these short- and medium-
range objectives. (Continue reading this chapter for more info on
how to study your prospects and prepare your script.)
Consider what you must accomplish to stay on course to achieve
your goals. Look at the next month:
 How much money in commission do you need this month to
fund your lifestyle?
 How much money in commission is your goal for the month?
 How many sales do you need to achieve the commission goal?
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
42
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 

 How many appointments or sales presentations do you need
to achieve the number of sales to reach the goal?
 How many contacts must you secure to meet the required
number of appointments?
 How many dials will it take to reach the contact goal?
 What must you do this week to achieve at least one-fourth 
of your monthly goal?
 Who are your most probable targets for achieving sales this
week?
 Do you have enough good targets to reach your weekly goal?
 If the number of probable targets is low, what action must you
take to change the outcome?
Telephone-sales success relies on a consistent formula: Identify
your goals, determine what course can get you there, act upon that
course, and refine your action plan as required as you progress.
Reviewing your sales cycle
Knowing your field’s or company’s sales cycle — the process from
first contact to final sale — is invaluable, especially when focusing
on your objectives. This information can allow you to manage your
time and get the necessary preparation done for each sale. The
more familiar you are with your sales cycle, the easier it is to pre-
pare for and keep on top of the process and determine whether
you’re meeting your goals and objectives or falling short.
A sales cycle for a product or service is the order of action taken 
to achieve the sale. For example, if you’re selling long-distance tele-
phone service to individuals, your sales cycle may look like this:
 Secure a targeted list that your company will probably 
provide for you.
 Make initial calls to the people on the list using approved
scripts and dialogues for opening statements.
 Find out their current provider with in the first three minutes
of the call.
 Bridge to your pre-scripted comparison evaluation between
their current service and yours.
 Confirm that they see the clear advantages they would enjoy
by changing services.
 Close for the order and confirm a good decision was made.
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 43

Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
44
This example is obviously a smaller sales cycle because of the one-
call close objective of selling long distance. If you were selling busi-
ness long distance rather than individual long distance, the sales
cycle may be longer, with a few more calls and more comparison
and evaluation between services.
Chances are slim that you can speed up the timeframe or stream-
line the process. The average sales cycle reflects a successful sales
history in your company or field. Depending upon the product or
service you sell and the type of client you sell to, your sales cycle
may be as short as ten minutes or as long as six months.
Be sure you know the answers to these questions regarding 
the sales cycle:
 What is the length of the sales cycle for your product, 
company, or industry?
 What are the phases of the typical sales cycle (phone calls, pre-
sentations, follow-up calls, information packets, and so on)?
 What actions must you perform in order to complete the 
sales cycle?
These questions can help you have the right timing for the sale.
Some of selling is being there at the right time. If you’re too early
or too late with a wonderful offer or opportunity, you won’t
acquire the sale.
Preparing for daily assignments
High scores in telephone sales require daily preparation. The suc-
cessful telephone salesperson has a game plan for the day — every
day. If you want to meet your goals and objectives, you need to do
more than just walk in the door, put your stuff away, grab a cup of
coffee, switch on your computer, put your headset on, and make
the first dial. The following sections help you prepare your own
game plan.
Planning for every call
Begin by preparing for each and every call . . . no exceptions. 
Before you pick up the phone, have the answers to the following
questions:
 Why are you calling this person? To book an appointment? To
confirm receipt of information? Are you making a presentation?

 If you’re making a presentation, do you have your questions pre-
pared? Your script? Have you personalized your presentation
for this particular call?
 What is the desirable outcome for this call?
Anything can derail a sale. You want to avoid derailment through
knowing clearly the goals and objectives of each call that you invest
your time, effort, and energy into.
Setting the call objective
No matter how inconsequential you think a call may be, setting a
goal for every call is important. Make your primary objective a tan-
gible one; instead of “Convince the prospect to consider my product
further,” be sure an action is attached to it: “Take an order.” “Book
an appointment.” “Gather full profile from lead.” “Ask all qualifying
questions.” When you hang up the phone, you then have a material
reflection of the results.
Be prepared with a back-up objective, too. If your primary objec-
tive is to make an order and that doesn’t happen, what’s the sec-
ondary outcome you’d like to have? Getting the prospect to agree
to a face-to-face meeting? Procuring a referral from the prospect?
Getting permission to call the prospect in a few months to see
whether circumstances have changed?
When establishing objectives, be sure that you balance your 
optimism with reality. Be forward-thinking, but not delusional.
Expecting the prospect to switch to your services and commit to 
a five-year contract for $100,000 a year with the first call is just this
side of deranged. A primary objective of a single, smaller sale is
optimistic — and a back-up objective of booking an appointment 
is realistic. All in all, try to strike a good balance.
Rehearsing your words
In order to meet your overall objectives, you want to take a few 
minutes before making a call to practice and know what you’re 
going to say. What you say to the prospect is guided by your objec-
tive: If you’re trying to determine whether the company is a good
fit for your product, you prepare your list of qualifying questions.
(See Chapter 10 for more about qualifying prospects.)
If you’re planning to sell, you pull out your sales script. (More about
script-preparation later in this chapter in the “Delivering a Straight-
A Script” section.) And if you’re anticipating specific objections, you
plan for some compelling responses. (Turn to Chapter 13.) If you
don’t take a few moments to rehearse, you won’t be prepared, and
you risk blowing the call and blowing the lead, sometimes for good.
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 45

Establishing call length
To keep control of your schedule, establish your call length in
advance. This doesn’t mean you have to abruptly cut the call short
if you’re still tying things up or if an enthusiastic prospect is asking
more questions. And, of course, you need to invest the time in build-
ing a personal connection. But giving yourself an average timeframe
helps keep you on track.
In most cases, longer calls don’t bring better results. In your busi-
ness, a time standard has most likely been set for the typical follow-
up, presentation, booking, or service call. When you exceed the
planned call length, then you have to evaluate why. If, for example,
you’re investing too much time on meeting your primary objective,
it may be necessary to switch to your back-up goal.
Studying Your Prospects
Knowledge is the key to the door of opportunity. When you study
up on your prospects before your calls, you gather information
that is bound to unlock sales success. As a side benefit, prospects
are impressed and flattered when you show you’re acquainted with
their business. And your pre-call research also helps you avoid
being sideswiped by sensitive situations you may not have been
aware of.
Before the Internet, doing such research was much more difficult.
Today you can find a ton of reliable and valuable info online. This
section shows you what to look for and where to turn when study-
ing your prospects. (For more on prospecting, turn to Chapter 5.)
Boning up on the company
Remember your job-hunting days? You were advised to walk into
every interview with a solid background on the company. Your pre-
call research should uncover similar information. You want to make
sure you’re familiar with a prospect’s company, including:
 Core business
 Key management, including president, CEO, COO, and CFO
 Company history
 Size: number of employees, divisions, and locations
 Financial information, including recent annual report
 Market share
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
46

 Stock-market history
 Major competitors
 Management in the division your contact works in
 Sales figures for that division
Gathering any other information that gives you a glimpse of the
company’s character — press releases, news articles, corporate
mission statement, core values, and even employee policies and
benefits — is a good idea.
Taking the three-click crash course
By investing even five minutes before an important sales call to dig
up a little dirt on your prospect, you can dramatically increase
your knowledge, improve your call performance, and increase the
odds of success. And it’s as easy as three clicks on your computer.
Click one: Visit the corporate Web site
On the company’s Web site, you can find plenty about its services
and products. Check for information about the senior managers.
Often, their e-mail addresses are listed — and you may need those
in the future. Review the mission statement or core values. Quickly
read any recent press releases (ideally published in the last three
to six months).
Don’t put too much value on company-issued press releases. Press
releases, in most cases, skew positive — announcing achievements
and successes or launches of cutting-edge products or strategic
projects. Most are written to position the company as a leader in
their field. You may want to check an independent source to verify
some of that info.
Click two: Search online
Checking up on a company via an Internet search engine brings up
references on other Web sites, from news and trade e-zines to per-
sonal blogs. Read a few articles about the company in third-party
publications (although you’re likely to see a regurgitation of the
same press releases you discovered on the company’s Web site).
Find out whether others are critical or whether the company has
some public relations issues. Be sure to check the date — an arti-
cle that’s three years old may not depict the present state of the
company.
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 47

You may also come across the sites of competitors in your Internet
search. Frequently, other companies buy ads around their competi-
tion’s search-engine traffic. So find out what’s up with the 
competition — you may even identify some future prospects!
Click three: Research your contact
Finally, research your company contact by typing the name into an
Internet search engine. Of course, you may find information about
her on the corporate Web site, but unless she’s senior management,
there’s a good chance she’s not included.
When you type the name into a search engine, you bring up refer-
ences both professional and personal. You’re as likely to learn that
your prospect leads seminars in your industry as you are that she’s
president of the PTA. You could discover that she has won top pro-
fessional awards — and that she won a blue ribbon in the state fair
quilting exhibit. Personal information about a prospect comes in
handy when trying to build rapport.
With this information you can guide the conversation to areas that
you know will peak their interest. You know in advance that if they
are president of the PTA that they are very active in school functions
and issues.
Posing as a Customer
Gathering info the company freely gives out to the general public 
is completely above board — and smart. The best way to access 
this info oftentimes is to act like you’re a prospective client. In fact,
to fully understand the company and best serve the client, you 
certainly want to experience its services from the consumer’s view-
point. This section gives you a couple ways to find out more about
your prospect by acting like one of its customers.
“Send me a brochure”
If you want to find out more about a company, just ask for a
brochure. Granted, some of this info may be repetitive to info on 
the company’s Web site (check out the earlier section, “Click one:
Visit the corporate Web site”), but you also may uncover a tidbit
you didn’t know. Most companies are prepared to provide con-
sumers with a brochure or information packet that explains and
promotes their business, product, or service. And in most cases,
getting your hands on this material is as easy as clicking a link on
the company Web site.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
48

If you want to dig further, you may find that a phone call will pro-
duce more results. The source for this information is likely to be
someone in administration — or possibly sales — but not typically
the contact you’re trying to win as a client. You may ask, for exam-
ple, whether the company offers more detailed information about
specific services — or the activities of a particular division (the one
you’re trying to secure as a client, of course).
This type of research means advance preparation, though. Rather
than starting your research gathering the day before your sales call,
you need to work a week to ten days ahead in order to receive and
digest the company materials. If you want to speed up the process
and reduce the company’s costs, ask it to e-mail the info to you.
“In the market for some stock”
Another great way to find out information is to buy some stock.
Call the company for some information or contact your broker.
Stockholders of publicly traded companies receive insider infor-
mation, including copies of annual reports. These year-end sum-
maries typically include financial information and a description 
of short-term and long-term projects.
When you read the annual report, you’re getting the straight 
story —but told in as positive a light as possible. This report is 
an opportunity for the company to share its success stories with
investors in order to encourage them to invest even more.
So become a shareholder and get in on the news. Owning even 
one share can give you an advantage in a couple ways:
 It puts you on the mailing list for corporate communication 
and keeps you abreast about your investment — your invest-
ment in this company as a client, that is.
 You can also share with the prospect that you own stock in
the company. He’ll be impressed that he’s dealing with not 
just a salesperson, but a stockholder, as well.
Delivering a Straight-A Script
Ever take part in a school play? I’m willing to bet you followed a
script, which led you word by word through the performance. You
probably rehearsed for weeks, until you could read the lines in your
dreams. But could you imagine accepting the role of, say, Juliet, and
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 49

simply showing up for the performance without ever having looked
at a script, only knowing that you were playing a star-crossed
teenage lover destined to die?
Plays, oral reports, bar mitzvah speeches, class lectures — they 
all require a script. And the most effective deliveries are from those
individuals who prepare and follow that script. The same goes for
telephone salespeople. Using a script ensures the quality of the 
call, increases impact, guides your prospects and clients more
effectively, shortens your call time, and increases sales and cus-
tomer satisfaction. The net result is that you make more calls in 
the day for more sales. Who wouldn’t want that?
Are you not sure where to start with your script? Not to worry.
This section explains what to include in a script, how to rehearse,
and what you can add to it to personalize it.
Following the company line
Businesses often insist that their phone-sales staff follow an
approved script, which is a wise practice. Good companies have 
distilled their years of sales experience into presentations that have
historically delivered results. Scripts are designed to help you and
the company achieve sales, so don’t be too quick to change them —
that only moves you from the proven to the unproven.
If you’re new to sales or new to selling this product or service, my
best guidance is to follow the company scripts, at least until you’ve
established yourself in the upper-middle tier of the sales force. If
the company doesn’t provide scripts for telephone-sales efforts,
bring up the situation with your sales manager. In a positive way,
explain that a company-endorsed script could help you — and the
others on the sales force — to improve your calls and results and
ensure a consistent message and image to prospective customers.
In this section, I include all you need to know about constructing,
rehearsing, and even personalizing your sales script.
The ABCs of a well-
constructed script
The best rule anyone can give you in sales is to use scripts. 
A good script should be structured with three elements in mind:
 The purpose: The script for completing a sale isn’t the same
as the one for booking an appointment. Qualifying a prospect
requires a different approach than delivering a presentation.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
50

The purpose of your call dictates the content of your script.
Determine this before you finalize your script.
 The recipient: Who are you intending to reach? A consumer?
A business person? The receptionist? The CEO? A purchasing
agent? The script varies, depending upon the answer to this
question.
 The offer: If you sell a line of products or services, your script
may be targeted to a single item or a family of items. In order
to select the proper script, you want to know this first.
A good script also follows the sales cycle for your product or serv-
ice, moving you up one rung at a time (refer to the “Reviewing your
sales cycle” earlier in this chapter for more info). If your typical
sales cycle takes the form of three initial calls to introduce yourself,
send information, and qualify the prospect, your scripts must be
designed in that manner. A four-step process and a two-script sales
arsenal just don’t add up.
Just as an A-plus class paper has an accepted structure with 
consistent components, so does a telephone-sales script. If you’re
following the company script, try to identify its key parts. If you find
yourself in a situation in which you must write your own script, this
information is critical. A good call script includes
 An opening statement: This opening launches the call with
ease, quickly introduces you and your product, and piques
interest in a few seconds. (Turn to Chapter 9.)
 A request for an appointment (phone or face to face): If the
appointment is part of the sales cycle, you want to ask for an
appointment. If you’re selling a product in which the sales
cycle is a one-call close, then you omit this step.
 Questions to qualify the prospect: Ask questions in order 
to ensure that your time on the appointment is well spent. 
You want to find out about the prospect’s typical purchasing
process, and specific needs, wants, problems, and desires.
 The core presentation: Show how your product or service 
fits the prospect’s needs. (Chapter 12 includes the scoop on
designing and scripting presentations.)
 The initial close: This is the first asking for the order of your
presentation, which will usually be followed with objections
by the prospect. (See Chapter 14 for more on the types of
closes you can use.)
 Objection handling: Although you don’t include all possible
objections, you definitely need to have them at hand and
ready. (See Chapter 13.)
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 51

 The final close: After you get the objections out of the way,
your job is to go back and gain the final commitment for the
sale and confirm that the prospect made a good decision.
Rehearsing for a winning delivery
Scripted calls seem to have a bad rap among salespeople. I often
hear complaints that scripts sound unprofessional. I laugh at that
because, in my view, stuttering and struggling for the words to say
are much more unprofessional than following a script. I suspect
that what sounds unpolished about script reading to these folks 
is salespeople who haven’t rehearsed or prepared enough. The
script is rarely at fault.
Before you actually pick up the phone and make the call, you want
to take a few minutes to rehearse the call and make your call seem
fresh and not canned. However, rehearsing is more than simply
parroting the words to get successful results from a good script.
You can make it or break it with nuances in pauses, tonality, feed-
back-response techniques, pace, voice inflection, and conviction.
Incorporating, tweaking, and testing these components with a few
practice sessions is bound to make for a smoother, more-natural
reading.
Translating written script to speech
When you rehearse, you can work out any awkward spots where
written dialogue doesn’t translate naturally in verbal mode.
For example, while writing Success as a Real Estate Agent 
For Dummies (Wiley), I came to loggerheads with the editorial 
staff. They wanted to make some changes to the sample scripts in
the book in order to correct grammar. They were clearly right . . .
about the grammar. But all our scripts have been tested and proven
by hundreds of thousands of real estate agents over more than 15
years.
Those grammar glitches were designed into the scripts to make
them more conversational — a critical component of a winning 
sales script. A couple of phone calls cleared things up between us,
and my scripts appeared in the book untouched. My advice is to 
not get hung up on grammar . . . get hung up on the results. Does 
the script work? Then it’s correct!
Planning pauses and indicating voice inflections
You may be thinking, “What? Planning pauses and marking voice
inflection?” Yes; you want to note on your script where to pause
and where to change the tone of your voice. These techniques may
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
52

seem too rehearsed, but, paradoxically, they help create a more
natural, conversational tone. And they yield fabulous results for
the salespeople who plan, prepare, and use them on calls.
When rehearsing a winning script, make notes on the script about
pauses and changes in voice inflections:
 Pauses: Pauses are important because they give the prospect
time to think and consider your points. After you’re on the call,
you may rush right through your lines — whether out of nerv-
ousness or a desire not to take up too much of the prospect’s
time. However, pauses allow you to keep an effective pace.
Highlight pause points or insert an ellipse to indicate a pause.
 Tone or voice inflection: Do you want to deliver with a down-
swing in your voice at the end of a sentence? The downswing
conveys power, authority, and conviction of your statement or
question.
By properly employing pauses, inflections, and other techniques,
you can avoid sounding like a prerecorded automated customer-
service line.
Testing, testing . . . one, two, three
During your rehearsal, you can’t just sit down for a few minutes,
read through the script, and then pick up the phone. Make sure
you follow these three steps of the rehearsal process:
1. Read through the script aloud, getting a feel for the 
delivery speed, pauses, downswings, and convictions.
You may have your sales manager review the script, too. 
If you feel it has some weakness, the two of you may agree
on some minor changes for improvement.
2. Role-play with your sales manager or another sales-
person, and be sure to have the other person read the
script, too.
Put yourself in your prospect’s shoes to gauge reaction.
Listen to the pause points when your role-play partner
delivers the script. Did you get them in the right spot to
increase the power?
3. Test your script with the prospect.
At least one individual has to serve as a guinea pig. Listen
for the reaction on the phone. Does the prospect seem con-
fused? Are there gaps of silence because she can’t answer
your questions? Your attention to the response helps you
fine-tune your delivery for greater effectiveness.
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 53

Taking time to revise
Your script doesn’t end when you hang up the phone. After you
hang up, take a moment to debrief:
 What did you do well?
 What area needs improvement in your delivery?
 Were there parts that went over like a lead balloon?
 Was undue resistance created at any part?
 Did the script lead to a discussion by the prospect?
 Were the pauses right?
 Do you need to change the pace of delivery or tonality?
 Did it work better than the script you were using before?
 What do you need to change?
After you answer some of these questions, revisit the script, make
notes, and determine whether you need to make changes to
improve the script.
Don’t change the script because your first delivery is less than stel-
lar. Testing is essential to define a script as a success or a flop. Test
it — as is — at least 25 to 30 times by tracking such factors as con-
tacts to leads, leads to appointments, and appointments to sales. If
your numbers aren’t where you want them at that point, go ahead
and tweak the script. By the time you cross the 50 to 75 threshold,
you should know whether you need to start over. Don’t undertest
scripts!
Personalizing the script
For people who are new to sales or who may have been struggling
with their sales numbers, I encourage you to stick with tried-and-
true company scripts. But don’t misunderstand — I’m not endorsing
generic scripting! A good script, whether for lead generation or clos-
ing, is formatted to allow for personalization. This section points out
a few easy ways that you can personalize your script without stray-
ing off the path.
What’s in a name?
No sound is sweeter than the sound of your own name. So when
speaking to a prospect, inserting his name into the script is bound
to get a positive reaction.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
54

Before you can effectively use the name, however, you have to be
able to say it. And how is it that your call list is exploding with 20-
letter last names containing two vowels and unfamiliar accents?
What to do — risk butchering the name? Stick to the first name? Or
in the case that the first name is the challenge, refer to them as Mr.
or Ms. Whomever? I recommend three options:
 Plan ahead. Call the assistant or receptionist and ask for 
help with the pronunciation before calling the prospect.
 Call the prospect well before the opening of the business
day. You want to reach her voice mail greeting — not her.
Listen carefully as she says her name — and write it out 
phonetically.
 Confess at the get-go that you’re clueless. Trust me, this won’t
be the first time the prospect has heard this. Expressing some
interest into the name’s origin may help distract from any
awkwardness. As the prospect pronounces the name, write it
down phonetically, then repeat it back, asking if you’ve said 
it correctly. Your care, diligence, and desire to get it right may
just launch your relationship in a successful direction.
Once upon a time . . .
You can also personalize scripts through short stories and anec-
dotes about your product or service and its effectiveness for others.
This works well, no matter what you’re selling. By sharing success
stories, you increase the credibility of your product and your 
company. The stories can’t be novels, however. You want your
anecdotes to be easy to grasp, illustrative, and compelling, such 
as the following:
“Fred, my client, Bob Smith, at XYZ Company had the same
challenges you are describing. When he started using our
machine, he reduced his costs by 35 percent in less than a
month.”
“Stan, my client Susan Jones, of ABC Company, had a similar
problem. When we placed our machine in her company, she saw
an immediate return of $5,000 in additional sales in just two
weeks. So, our machine paid for itself in that short amount of
time.”
Earning trust
You’re only as good as your word, as they say, and when dialoguing
with prospects, one of the strongest tools you have is your personal
guarantee. Whether it’s for on-time delivery, lowest price, or lifetime
service, when you give your word that you and your company will
come through, you make big points with the customer.
Chapter 4: Doing Your Homework for A-Plus Calls 55

Make sure your script has room for personal guarantees. But, be
absolutely positive that you can stand by your commitment, what-
ever it is. For example, if you know you have absolutely no control
over escalating costs, don’t promise a locked-in price. Instead, you
may be able to commit to alerting the prospect about upcoming
price increases.

P
rospecting: Brings to mind images of the Old West, doesn’t 
it? History has made the determined prospector who spent
every backbreaking day panning for gold in a churning river or
swinging a pickaxe into hard rock mythological. However, lots of
miners returned to their homes with nothing. Some were seduced 
by get-rich-quick schemes — card playing, stagecoach robbing, and
so on. And plenty, after a brief taste of the demands of the work,
realized that an easier way to make a living had to be out there
somewhere. But a handful of dedicated and persistent 49ers with-
stood the harsh conditions and, day in and day out, continued the
grueling task. To these folks came the fortunes of the Gold Rush.
Prospecting really isn’t so different for the telephone-sales 
professional. They just mine for a different kind of reward: sales!
And success is still the result of hard work, determination, and 
fortitude. It requires rolling up your proverbial shirtsleeves and 
digging in — committing to the day-to-day chore of making tele-
phone calls. Any shortcut to bypass this effort leads only to 
fool’s gold.

I have yet to meet a salesperson who is dying to prospect. No 
one gets up in the morning, leaps out of bed, and says, “I’m excited
today — I get to make 200 cold calls!” But face it: Prospecting is the
bedrock of sales success. And it can even be fun if you approach it
with a can-do attitude and the right tools. Honest. In this chapter, 
I outfit you for your search for gold — I mean, sales — and help
guide you along the surest path to the mother lode of leads. Eureka!
Plenty of sales trainers may try to convince you otherwise; they may
swear they’ve discovered a miraculous prospecting-free route to
riches. But, believe me, anyone who tells you that you can become 
a champion sales leader without prospecting is nothing more than 
a snake-oil salesman. So the next time you’re offered a ticket to the
“greatest show on earth,” pass it up and get back on the phone.
Understanding What Prospecting
Is — and Isn’t
Webster defines prospecting as “seeking a potential customer,
seeking with a vision of success.” You can find two key concepts
worth considering here:
 Seeking: Notice that Webster’s definition doesn’t say waiting,
hoping, or praying. Action is implied here. You require effort 
to go find these potential customers.
 Vision of success: Effective prospecting requires an optimistic
approach, a belief in a positive outcome. It forbids the influ-
ence of other salespeople who may have bought into other
definitions of prospecting.
You may find various other definitions for prospecting in your
dictionary. But in the language of the telephone-sales world, the
word may have a narrower meaning than in other translations.
Prospecting is limited to a very specific action: talking. Not mailing,
not blogging, not advertising. If you’re not on the phone or face 
to face with a person, you’re not prospecting.
Table 5-1 shows the differences between prospecting activities 
and other tasks.
Too often salespeople only work the leads that they have currently.
A salesperson always needs new leads to work, and that is what
prospecting creates — new leads. Like I always say: “The pathway
to riches in sales is the prospecting pathway.”

The power of prospecting: 
A first-hand account
In 1991, I joined a new sales firm. The sales office was populated with experienced
and high-producing professionals. To succeed, I knew that I needed to prospect
more than the other salespeople. My prior experience prepared me to do what was
necessary — to make a certain number of dials and contacts each day.
I arrived at the office at 7 a.m. every day. I was on the phone by 8 a.m. — list calling
and cold calling. Heck, as long as those prospects had phone numbers, I’d call them
as long as they had a pulse. The other salespeople laughed about the “new kid’s”
zeal. The laughing died down in less than six months when I moved into the top pro-
duction category. The laughter stopped when I made more than six figures in earn-
ings my first year. And my grin started when I held the number-one sales position in
less than three years. If you make this same commitment to prospecting, you too can
see this kind of sales success.

Prospecting: The Cornerstone 
of Your Business
Prospecting must be the foundation of your business. E-mail corre-
spondence, support marketing pieces and brochures, or any other
tool is the icing on the cake. Prospecting is the cake. Without a solid
foundation, a house won’t be safe, secure, or stand for decades into
the future. Without the foundation of prospecting, a sales career
won’t hold up, either.
In the following sections, I explain how to make prospecting the
cornerstone of your sales career with a strong support system. I
also show you how to aim for the best prospects and work toward
specific prospecting goals.
Setting and achieving goals
When you’re first starting out in sales — or in a new sales job —
start with easily attainable goals as you build healthy prospecting
habits. You don’t run a marathon without having trained for weeks
or months to increase your endurance. Nor would you set the goal
of 100 contacts in a day of sales prospecting — that’s marathon-level
prospecting!
In setting daily and weekly prospecting goals, concentrate on fol-
lowing these three steps, which all flow into each other and help
you establish your goals:
1. Establish a number of contacts.
The number of qualified prospects — decision makers who
are able to purchase your product or service or can refer
you to someone who could — that you decide to call must
be based on your goals, sales cycle, and sales ratios.
When I coach a new sales client, I like to start him at realis-
tic goals for daily contacts. Of course, sales numbers of any
kind vary greatly, based on product or service, cost, sales
cycle, presentation length, and any number of factors. But
as a general rule, a safe minimum is 15 to 25 contacts a day.
Seem low? Remember, a contact is two-way conversation
with a potential prospect. It’s not a voice mail message, a
discussion with a gatekeeper, or a call to gather background
information.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
60

It may take several weeks for you to build up to this number.
After you find yourself comfortably achieving 15 to 25 con-
tacts a day for three weeks straight without missing a single
day, you’re ready to ratchet up: 30, 35, 40 a day.
2. Calculate the number of leads.
After you review the list of all those people you contacted,
this list is the total number of contacts who demonstrated 
a motivation and desire to make an investment in your prod-
uct or service. They said something that led you to believe
that your product or service is a viable solution to their
problem — and that they have the financial capacity to 
make the investment.
3. Project a number of appointments.
From that list of leads, you must establish a list of follow-
up face-to-face or phone meetings that you must schedule.
During this appointment, you discuss in more detail their
needs and wants, share more information about your serv-
ice or product and how your company works, and build the
foundation for a relationship. The more you can secure an
exclusive relationship, the more control you can have in the
sales process.
Building the four pillars 
of prospecting
You need a system of support for your foundation of prospecting.
You can’t just go at it without a little forethought and elbow 
grease. You need some specific guidelines for carrying out your
plan in order to accomplish your sales goals. My four pillars of
prospecting are just the thing to stabilize your sales efforts and
build long-range success.
Pillar #1: Find a set time and place for daily prospecting
Many salespeople make the commitment to prospect every 
day — but their mistake is trying to work it in around their day. 
That approach doesn’t work long term. Instead of working your
prospecting around your day, work your day around your prospect-
ing. Schedule a segment of your day — same time every day — to
prospect, and have a set place for it.
If you’re unable to reach whom you’re calling, you need to vary your
approach. You may want to periodically add additional prospecting
sessions on differing days and at different times. You may be trying
to catch someone who will never be available in your primary
prospecting block.
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Success 61

In a previous sales position, I had set up a prospecting space in 
my private office. It was a standup area with a computer and a tele-
phone with a headset. My prospecting scripts were tacked on the
wall where I could see them. On the other wall were my objection-
handling scripts. Having all my tools within reach or in sight allowed
me to not fumble for a moment with a prospect — I was ready for
anything.
Here are two helpful tips that I gathered from setting up this space:
 A good-quality headset is one of the best investments a 
telephone-sales professional will find. Check for features 
such as sound quality, comfort, fit, and range. You may have
to spend a few hundred dollars, but the expense is worth it.
 Standing up while prospecting is an amazing technique 
to pump up your passion and energy. Your body language
accounts for 55 percent of your communication — even when
you are on the phone. A headset frees up your hands so that
you can use them to engage in the sales process more effec-
tively. The combination of standing and freeing up your hands
is guaranteed to raise the level of passion, conviction, and
enthusiasm your prospect hears when talking to you.
Pillar #2: Fight off distractions
First of all, distractions are a fact of sales life. And truth be told,
most people are looking for them: the inbound phone call, a diffi-
cult client, an e-mail, another salesperson who wants to talk, a
problem sale, a broken fingernail. Any excuse will do — you can
call it creative avoidance.
And don’t think you’re off the hook after you achieve telephone-
sales success — top salespeople have more potential for distraction
because they have a greater volume of business. The sooner you
accept the fact that distractions are a constant threat, the better
prepared you’ll be to fight them off.
So what do you do when distractions hit? The best way to fend off
distractions while you’re prospecting is to not let them happen in
the first place! Hold all calls and messages. Put up a do-not-disturb
sign on your office door. Take whatever steps are necessary to
divert distractions. (See more tips on eliminating distractions in
Chapter 7 on time management.)
Ironically, your own effective prospecting efforts may be the biggest
distraction-making culprit. Prospecting calls always generate pro-
duction-supporting activities. Many prospects want further informa-
tion, future contact, comparison data, and outside input. And, of
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
62

course, each call may require a follow-up thank-you note or recap 
of your discussion.
Don’t break your stride now. Take a moment to jot down a few
notes about the tasks you need to do, so you can remember them
later and get back on the phone now. Be in the moment. Stay on
your prospecting path — the quickest route to sales success.
Pillar #3: Follow the plan
Prospecting is only effective if it generates a truly qualified lead —
someone who is interested in what you offer, needs the service you
provide, and has the ability and authority to become a client of your
business — or refers you to someone who could. A contact isn’t a
secretary, voice mail, an assistant, the babysitter, a 10-year-old, or 
a teenager. Those salespeople who strike it rich at prospecting set
their sights on the best opportunity for making sales. They don’t
waste their time calling iffy contacts that may not even be in the
market for their product or service.
Success boils down to some very simple formulas. Following the
right steps in the proper order is one of those formulas. In short,
you need a plan. For best results, set up your daily prospecting
plan at the end of the prior workday. Before you leave your office
today, lay out your call schedule for tomorrow. Set everything you
need on your desk so you’re ready the minute you walk in the door
in the morning.
Establishing a daily routine reinforces your commitment to the
process and helps build good habits. It can be as simple as the 
following steps:
1. Research prospects and set up your call list the day
before.
Invest the time in determining who you’re going to call
tomorrow before you leave today. If you can invest time in
researching before you leave you’ll be better prepared for
tomorrow’s calls. Turn to Chapter 4 for how to research
your prospects.
2. Set aside time to practice your script and rehearse
responses just before you begin your calls.
You want to spend about 20 minutes practicing your scripts
and dialogues before your pick up the phone for the day. See
Chapter 9 to know what scripts to practice.
3. Do a quick review of your list and daily goals.
4. Repeat (out loud) your favorite affirmation statements.
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Success 63

Using affirmations is a great way to get your mind in a posi-
tive state before you make your prospecting calls. You can
say your own, or try out some of the following:
• “I am a great prospector.”
• “I will generate _____ leads today.”
• “I am going to make _____ sales today.”
By following a similar routine, you can be warmed up and ready 
to give your task your best effort — just like any professional. The
minute you pick up the phone, practice is over — the limelight’s on
you.
One note of caution: Adequate preparation and warm-up is impor-
tant, but too much can be a sign of creative avoidance (see Pillar
#2)! If you spend more than 30 minutes to get ready to call, you’re
spending too much time.
You can target qualified leads by purchasing better lists that target
income, geography, demographics, or job titles. You may need to
target a CEO, a CFO, purchasing agents, or sales managers depend-
ing on what you’re selling. You can also target by company size in
sales, employee numbers, and number of offices or branches. You
can target past clients for additional sales or referrals. I would sug-
gest that you talk with your sales manager to understand what
groups of prospects offer the highest probability of success.
Pillar #4: Finish what you start
In order to win, you have to finish the race. The whole race. That
means fulfilling your daily goals every day, down to the very last
contact on your list. Don’t accept anything less!
If it’s been a particularly grueling day, throwing in the towel and 
cutting your calling short is easy: “What’s the point? One more call
won’t pull up my stats.” If you’ve hit record numbers, justifying quit-
ting before you’re done is also easy. “Hey, I’ve exceeded my goal — 
I don’t need to make any more calls today.” Again, resist the tendency
to seek any excuse to avoid fulfilling your prospecting goals. Don’t
settle; finish what you start.
Finishing what you start is more than just making it through your
list. You must also follow through with the contacts you made. A
great way to wrap things up most effectively with a contact is to
compose a handwritten thank-you note and mail it in a small (not a
standard business size) envelope. Unlike an e-mail or even a generic,
preplanned regurgitated form letter, your personal note will get
noticed. The typical consumer receives dozens of e-mails a day, 
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
64

selling everything from no-interest loans to Viagra. And the post
office delivers stacks of junk mail. Although most of this ends up 
in the “circular” file, a handwritten letter breaks through the clutter
to land in the A pile, which means it gets read — and keeps your
relationship alive until you talk again.
Connecting the Dots between
Numbers and Income
You’ve probably heard of cause and effect — a basic law of
physics. But you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand
that your prospecting efforts today can influence the results you
receive tomorrow. And as a telephone-sales professional, the more
you understand this connection, the better you can identify the
actions that will bring you the outcome you desire. And after you’ve
mastered this principle, you may see quantum leaps in your sales
activity.
In order to get you there, you need an understanding of the cause-
and-effect relationship between numbers and income as well as 
a record of your past performance, so you can chart your future
success. This section helps.
Harnessing the power of sales ratios
Sales ratios explain the relationship between various factors
involved in the selling process in a form that you can use to meas-
ure performance and establish goals. For example, take the daily
prospect list and number of contacts made for Salesman A:
 If Salesman A calls 80 prospects a day and has a voice-to-voice
conversation with 40 of them, he achieves a 2 to 1 (or 2:1) call-
to-contact ratio. (Not too shabby.)
 If he then succeeds in persuading 20 of these contacts that they
are candidates for his service, his contact-to-lead ratio is 2 to 1.
(Pretty good work.)
 Say he’s able to secure ten appointments from these leads.
Again, that’s a 2 to 1 ratio of leads to appointments. (This guy’s
on fire!)
 After completing those appointments, Salesman A has closed
five sales — at a ratio of, yes, 2 to 1.
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Success 65

You can also convey other relationships with ratios: prospects to
appointments; prospects to sales; number of closes to sales dollars;
and any other pairing.
These ratios help take the guesswork out of success by helping you
establish clearer expectations and goals. Measuring yourself against
the averages for your office or industry can give you an indication of
where you stand — and where you need to go. But in order to do
this, you need to keep track of your ratios (which I tell you how to
do in the following section).
Sales ratios also help you identify what areas you need to work on.
If I see your sales ratios, I can tell you exactly what you need to do
to dramatically increase your sales. For example:
 If your prospect-to-contact list is low, I may advise you to
check the quality of your list to be sure it’s up-to-date or sug-
gest that you try calling at a different time of day.
 If your contact ratio is good, but your contact-to-lead ratio is
poor, you’d want to see whether you have the right kind of
customer for your service.
 If your lead-to-appointment ratio is below average, I’d say it’s
time to brush up on your phone presentation skills (which
you can do in Part II).
But you don’t need me to diagnose your strengths and weaknesses.
By understanding sales ratios, you can figure out on your own what
skills you need to attend to. That’s the power of sales ratios.
Tracking and recording everything
In order to use sales ratios to assess the effectiveness of your
prospecting efforts, you must capture the details of your sales 
activity. Consistent tracking of your numbers creates a record 
that can serve you well. You can break sales activity down to a
series of repeatable numbers that, over time, produces a predeter-
mined result. If you track your numbers over a few months, you 
can determine what you need to do to earn the income you desire.
Sales averages aren’t built in a day! Or even a week or month. 
Your ratios are most effective as measuring sticks when they reflect
your consistently documented activity over a period of at least three
months. I had days when I didn’t set an appointment. I probably had
weeks that I got skunked. Over a three-month period, however, I was
always within a 5-percent margin of error on my numbers.

Keep a complete and accurate record of your sales numbers. Table
5-2 is a sample tracking sheet you can use. (Feel free to create your
own.) You want to use this tracking sheet daily so you establish your
sales ratios. It will take three months worth of daily use to achieve
accuracy in your sales ratios.

Obeying the law of accumulation
The law of accumulation states that everything in life accumulates
either positively or negatively in disproportionate amounts. For
example, if you were to save $2.74 a day from the time you were 20
and you received an average rate of return of 9 percent over those
years, you would be a millionaire at 65. You would have saved only
about $45,000 over that time, but the law of accumulation did the
rest of the work. If you asked most people if they would trade
$45,000 for $1 million, they would say yes, but few people do.
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Success 67

The law of accumulation rules the world of prospecting, as well.
The daily amount of time and effort you invest in prospecting is 
a manageable amount, but the return is greater than the sum of 
its parts. And as with saving money, the payoff doesn’t come right
away. It may be 60 days later — or months and months, depending
on your particular sales situation. You have to make deposits in
daily prospecting over a period of time before you receive with-
drawals of commission income. The only way to ensure sales 
success is the daily deposit approach.
Success without Prospecting?
Shattering the Myth
I hear a lot of myths in my work as a sales coach: “My market is 
different.” “My product is not like others.” “You don’t understand
how we do things here in Mayberry.” And some salespeople think
they can get by or even make it big with little to no prospecting.
But these ways of thinking are myths through and through.
The prospecting guidelines I give you work in any market, with 
any product or service, at any place in the world at any time. The
reason I’m so confident is because I have taught and coached this
strategy to salespeople all over the world in numerous industries
with different products and services. And the fundamentals I share
with all of them are the same fundamentals you can read in this
chapter. The results for these companies and individual salespeo-
ple have been outstanding; many of these salespeople rise to the
top level in their company in a short period of time.
In the following sections, I break down the myth that you don’t need
prospecting for telephone-sales success, and help you know how to
deal with people who promote prospecting-free sales schemes.
Believe me — everyone needs to prospect!
Realizing that prospecting 
won’t disappear
Sorry to be the one to disappoint you, but you can’t find a miracle
pill or magic solution that makes the prospecting part of sales
vanish. Championship sales results are built upon solid practices
and supportive actions, and you can’t take prospecting out of that
ratio!
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
68

Plenty of folks may try to convince you that the fundamentals in
this chapter don’t apply to the salespeople who follow their short-
cut to success. Look out for promotions to buy their book, e-mails
to subscribe to their Web sites or e-newsletters, or — and this is
the jab that stings me the most — a phone invitation to their semi-
nars. Just imagine: A roomful of telephone salespeople making
calls to convince you that phone prospecting is obsolete!
These sales-meisters may allude to a secret selling method that
only they have discovered, promise a scientifically calculated for-
mula to quick success, or hint at a strategy so effective that you’ll
have prospects calling you, begging for your services. And that’s
about as likely as going fishing and watching the fish jump into
your boat. And it bears repeating one more time: Prospecting is the
foundation for sales success. You can’t leave it out any more than
you can skip laying the cornerstones for a 30-story building.
Determining fraud from sales god
Enthusiastic peddlers of quick-fix tactics do a great job of selling
their schemes. Getting drawn in by tales of effortless sales pickings
and fantasizing yourself on that sales-associate-of-the-year grand-
prize trip to Tahiti are easy. Indeed, some self-proclaimed sales
gurus paint a golden picture of possibility. But, there’s more (or less,
actually) to the picture than these wizards of prospect-free wealth
like to reveal.
Before believing any get-rich-quick sales schemes, pull back the
curtain and discover the truth. Demand hard evidence for their
method’s success: the connection between actions and results and
quantifiable measures of effectiveness. In at least 95 percent of the
cases, you’ll most likely find nothing there. So next time you’re
approached about such as scheme, ask these questions — and if
the great and powerful wizard of sales can’t answer them, you’ll
know it’s time to head back to Kansas:
 How many sales does this technique generate for you annually?
 How much time do you need to invest personally to set this
up and maintain it?
 What does it cost you to use this marketing service to generate
your leads?
 What conversion ratio does this technique generate?
 What percentage of your business comes from using this
method?
 How many clients did you get?
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Success 69

 What was the average sale made to those clients?
 What was your average commission earned from those clients?
 What is your net profit from this after all your costs?
 Have you included the value of your time in that equation?
Committing to the never-ending 
task of prospecting
The best nugget of advice I can give any salesperson is to start
prospecting today — and never, ever, ever stop prospecting. I com-
mend the dedicated telephone professionals who’ve discovered
that consistent and regular prospecting is the bedrock of sales 
success. The wisest also know that even after you strike it rich,
daily prospecting is still the best tool for mining an untapped
wealth of sales opportunity.
You may have been hoping that after you made it big in sales 
you could say adios to the daily chore of generating new leads? 
No such luck. When you commit to an effective and disciplined
prospecting process, you’re virtually guaranteed to create sales —
which in addition to income also creates more work: order-taking,
paper-signing, follow-up, problem-solving, customer service, and
so on. But growing income and increasing workload aren’t reasons
to stop prospecting. Does a concert pianist stop practicing after
she plays Carnegie Hall? Would a tennis pro quit working out just
because he won at Wimbledon? No — and neither should you
(never ever!).

Doing the math: Putting a prospect-
free scheme to the test
I recently received a marketing piece from a salesperson touting his prospect-less
lead-generation strategy. In his third year of business, he made 60 sales — a very
enviable number for the high-ticket, personal service he sold. His brochure also
noted that he generated 1,200 leads per month. I immediately grabbed my calcula-
tor (that’s just what the sales coach in me does) and computed his leads per year
as 14,400. So his 60 sales against 14,400 results in a conversion ratio turned out to
be less than half of 1 percent (0.004167, to be exact). That means he converted only
one person out of the 240 leads he generated through his so-called “no-fail”
prospect technique. Either his leads are marginal at best, or he is extremely 
ineffective at converting them. I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusion.

Conquering Sales 
Call Aversion
In This Chapter
 Diagnosing sales call aversion
 Enlisting strategies to fight sales call aversion
 Eliminating sales call aversion for good
O
ne of the most sinister threats to the aspiring telephone-sales
professional is sales call aversion. This condition is particu-
larly insidious because it starts out so mild that you may not even
notice you have it. And by the time you recognize the problem, you
may have already suffered the damage — low sales results.
Sales call aversion is one of the most common afflictions to sales-
people everywhere. This condition eats away at the productivity,
calls, and results of any salesperson. It can affect even salespeople
who are skilled and successful. Sales call aversion costs companies
worldwide billions of dollars a year in sales.
For salespeople, the most reliable measure of their future success 
is the number of consistent contacts they make to prospects. In
short, salespeople have to rely on their ability to pick up the phone
each day and make large volumes of calls. This fact is especially true
with new salespeople who are untested, unproven, and don’t have
extensive product or service knowledge yet.
All salespeople face the dreaded sales call aversion at one time or
another in their sales careers. But this chapter helps you identify
the symptoms of sales call aversion, determines which forms of the
conditions are more common and which you’re more susceptible to,
and offers strategies to build up your sales call aversion immunity.

Recognizing Sales Call Aversion
To fully understand sales call aversion, you need to be able to iden-
tify the signs. Some salespeople have difficulty recognizing when
they’re suffering from sales call aversion — but here’s an easy way
to test: Use your sales ratios and goals to take your temperature. If
you’re not making the required number of calls per day to achieve
your sales goals, that’s all the evidence you need to know . . . you
have sales call aversion!
So what exactly causes this condition? Although varied theories
exist, the following are some of the more popular:
 Your environment: Both your upbringing and work can lead
to periodic bouts with sales call aversion.
• Your upbringing: Maybe you were raised in a household
(as was mine when I was growing up) where sales wasn’t
a highly regarded career choice. My parents wanted us
to be professionals like doctors, dentists, accountants,
attorneys, and so on. Being a salesperson wasn’t viewed
as a pathway to success.
• Your work environment: Some people, maybe even
your manager, will raise your level of sales call aversion
and stunt your performance. For example, some low-
performing salespeople will want you to join their coffee
and donuts bunch. They’ll try to get you to join the com-
plainer convention of “how poor the leads are that the
company provides.” Don’t do it!
 Your sales field or company you work for: How do the sales-
people view themselves at your job? Do they view themselves
as salespeople, account managers, coordinators, customer
service representatives, account representatives, sales con-
sultants? People affix this never-ending list of job titles to
themselves either personally or corporately to avoid being a
salesperson. But face it, you’re all salespeople. Don’t let a job
title make you think you’re not at risk; you’re all susceptible 
to call aversion.
 Your DISC behavioral style: This style can influence your 
frequency and intensity of sales call aversion. Your DISC behav-
ioral style influences how you do everything in life, so it can
influence how you make calls and how many calls you will
make. (For more on your behavioral style, turn to Chapter 16.)
If you’re the reserved, introspective, introverted, noncompeti-
tive type, your likelihood of coming down with sales call aver-
sion is higher. If you score higher on the Steady or Compliant
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
72
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 

scale of a DISC assessment, you’ll have more difficulty initiating
new sales calls to people you don’t know. Your dial numbers
will usually be lower than someone whose high scores are in
the Dominant or Influencer scale.
If you can see marketing opportunities for what you’re selling 
and don’t seize the opportunities, you may be letting sales call aver-
sion suppress your decision to act. Logically, most people with sales
call aversion admit that they need to take action. The problem is if
they’re experiencing sales call aversion, few of them do take action.
Good Medicine: Treating 
Call Aversion
What do most telephone salespeople do when call aversion hits?
They avoid making calls — the very worst action they can take.
That makes about as much sense as deciding not to breathe when
you have a stuffy nose.
Avoiding the task only aggravates and increases the severity of
sales call aversion. The more you succumb to its symptoms, the
more difficult it is to overcome. Before it gets any worse, commit 
to the following.
Reducing aversion in your life
Sales call aversion is the psoriasis of phone-sales disorders. You can
treat it, you can reduce its damage, and it’s not likely to kill you, but
it’s hard to get rid of it for good. In this section, I recommend two
paths to reducing the threat of sales call aversion and its damaging
impact on your productivity and your sales career.
Clarifying the “why”
Making calls is a day-to-day commitment. Its importance can often
be overlooked when your sights aren’t set on your values and goals.
In short, you have to know why you make the calls. After you have
clarity of the why, the how becomes easy.
My father, a dentist, only worked Monday through Thursday. He
was always around on Fridays when I came home from school. In
the summer, we spent three days a week on a lake near the Oregon
Coast. My father worked harder in four days than most people work
in five in order to meet the financial goals he set for himself. His
why was borne out of his love for my mother. When I was 3, my
Chapter 6: Conquering Sales Call Aversion 73

mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. By the time I was in
the second grade, she’d lost her ability to walk. She spent the last
years of her life without the use of her arms or legs. My father was
determined to provide her with the most extraordinary life possi-
ble. Through his clarity of purpose, he managed to travel with my
wheelchair-bound mother and three sons to Mexico, Asia, Hawaii
(annually), and many other places. And he cared for her as her
condition worsened in the home they raised their children in.
As soon you achieve clarification of purpose — the why — the 
how makes itself known and you have an easier time staying on the
right path. For salespeople, goals are typically wrapped up in their
success in selling. And the most direct how is making a consistent
number of yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily telephone calls.
Admitting you have a problem and then getting help
Sales call aversion isn’t a theoretical condition. It’s a real problem
with real costs attached to it. According to numerous studies, the
reluctant salesperson defaults on an average of four pieces of new
business a month. To bring that home to your own backyard, take
the average commission you earn for an average sale and multiply
that number by four. That’s what’s lost each month by a sales-
person with sales call aversion.
The first step to conquering a condition is to recognize that you
have it. If, after reading this chapter, you feel you suffer from call
aversion, respond to it quickly by taking action. If you’re still not
quite sure, then here is one final option. I have an assessment at
Sales Champions that can measure and benchmark your sales call
aversion. It can help you identify the barriers and benchmark your
levels against top sales performers in a wide range of sales indus-
tries. For more information about this assessment, visit my Web
site at www.SalesChampions.com/CallAversion.
You can also take the following actions to help you treat this 
condition:
 Chart your progress daily. Doing so leads to results. For exam-
ple, set a written goal of making 100 calls a day, and then track
your progress. Writing down the goal and then monitoring your
results helps keep you on track and doesn’t let you off the
hook.
 Establish benchmark goals for dials and contacts for each
day. Set them at a level that will make you stretch, but also
keep them attainable. Being able to consistently meet your
goals for dials and contacts on a daily basis contributes to 
the reduction in sales call aversion.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
74

What can lead to greater sales call aversion is the up and down
numbers of calls that most salespeople make each day. For
example, Monday may be a high call day for you, but Tuesday
and Wednesday are slow. Thursday can be good, but then you
leave Friday afternoon for a round of golf. With this typical
week, far too many salespeople lack the consistency; they
never establish clear benchmarks, so sales call aversion can
take root.
All salespeople grapple with sales call aversion to some degree.
Even the best salespeople exhibit tendencies toward call aversion.
The question is whether it affects your sales performance? If you
believe it’s affecting your performance to the point where you’re
losing sales, take action sooner rather than later.
The taking-stock strategy
Chronic call aversion can stem from low self-esteem, lack of com-
fort-level with the product or service, or even uncertainty about
personal values and goals. The process of taking stock — of self,
sales products, and values — addresses all these root causes, and
helps boost confidence and clarity.
Stick to the following when taking stock to help you maximize your
efforts:
1. Take inventory of your personal skills and attributes.
Those qualities make you a good salesperson and a valued
employee. What are your problem-solving abilities, years 
of experience in fundraising, and your attention to detail?
2. If you get stuck, call past satisfied clients.
Such an exchange can remind you of your winning quali-
ties. This boost can counter those feelings of self-doubt
that may be keeping you off the phone!
3. Then, before you hang up, ask if the client needs any-
thing, ask for a referral, or share information about new
products.
This step primes the pump, so to speak, adding another
success to your score and leading you to a potentially
lucrative follow-up call.
4. After your personal inventory, tally up the features and
benefits of your company’s offerings.
When taking stock of what you and your company bring 
to the table, ask these questions:
Chapter 6: Conquering Sales Call Aversion 75

• What do we do for the prospects?
• What makes us different from our competition?
• What qualities make me the person they should work
with?
• What are the specific benefits of our services?
• If I had to select one reason above all others why
someone should do business with me, what would 
it be?
5. Keep your completed inventory report close at hand as 
a quick attitude picker-upper and a helpful reference of
product/service highlights.
If you’re struggling with sales call aversion over an extended
period of time, review the list every day. Keep it handy to
raise your confidence and the conviction of your message.
The setting-daily-goals strategy
Unrealistic goals can aggravate sales call aversion. If you hang a
“must-increase-productivity-by-500-percent” directive above your
head, you may be so overwhelmed by the big picture that you
can’t take the first step.
Don’t get ahead of yourself — sure, you may want to hit $1 million 
in sales by the end of the year. But instead of gazing out at that lofty
goal, break it down into smaller pieces: $1 million in sales a year is
$20,000 a week. Is it possible in your wildest imagination? If not,
adjust your goal and make it more attainable.
If the goal is realistic, break down your week into days and deter-
mine what steps to take each day to achieve it. At your close ratios,
how many calls per day must you make? For more about managing
your time for maximum productivity, turn to Chapter 7.
The ban-negative-self-talk strategy
Sometimes, the salesperson’s inner voice is his biggest fan and
encourager. However, at other times, that little voice chains the
sales pro to a cement block and pushes him into a deep river. Have
you heard comments in your head like “They’re going to reject you”
or “Why would they use me?” If you suffer from sales call aversion,
you want to get rid of any negative self-talk.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
76
P

Negative thoughts and talk generate stress and anxiety, which 
are certain to influence the course of the call. To utilize the ban-
negative-self-talk strategy, confront and put the handcuffs on this
criminal influence. For example, you can do this by repeating daily
affirmations out loud, while driving in the car to work or right before
you make the call. This negative self-talk still may pop up again from
time to time, but with repeated daily affirmations, the voice gets 
quieter, and after a few calls, it goes away completely. (Check out
Chapter 18 for how to use daily affirmations.)
If your inner voice is a particularly fierce critic, try writing down 
the negative self-talk messages. Capturing them on paper helps you
refute the statements. Write down your positive self-talk responses,
too, and you can feel the shift, giving the supportive self-talk 
a greater voice.
The visualize-the-perfect-
call strategy
Human nature often drives the salesperson to imagine the worst
possible outcome of a sales call. However, if you’re going to fanta-
size, make it a story with a happy ending. Before starting a call,
picture it playing out the best way possible.
Just before your scheduled call, follow these steps:
1. Visualize yourself on the phone, speaking with confidence.
Visualizing good thoughts serves as a rehearsal for the real
call. The more you run your story line through the mental
projector, the more likely it is to become reality.
2. Imagine a receptive prospect, asking questions.
3. Picture your exchange, building toward the climactic
moment when the prospect says, “I’ll take it!”
The ten-minute strategy
Anticipating hours on the phone may not be the most motivating
thought — even for the most positive and successful of salespeople.
But for the reluctant caller, that anticipation can delay or preempt
the activity entirely.
Chapter 6: Conquering Sales Call Aversion 77

If you find yourself in this situation, try the ten-minute strategy:
Give yourself permission to blow off the phone calls for the morn-
ing, afternoon, or day. But before you’re permitted to walk away
from the telephone, resolve to make ten minutes’ worth of calls.
Promise yourself that when the ten minutes is up, you can quit.
The benefit of the ten-minute strategy is that you break the negative
pattern. Sure, you only stayed on the phone for ten minutes — made
a few or even just one call — before you quit for the day. But you
took the first step — it’s still progress! When you perceive this as
positive, a good attitude helps reinforce good habits. Maybe
tomorrow you’ll do it again, possibly even for longer.
After you take the hardest step of picking up the phone, the rest
isn’t so difficult. In fact, you may find that your 10 minutes turned
into 30. Or more. All without you suffering a bit.

Investing Your Time Wisely
In This Chapter
 Accomplishing more in less time with the 80/20 Rule
 Putting direct-income-producing activities first
 Using time blocking and to-do lists as tools for sales success
 Keeping your time management on track
T
he effective use of time is a critical skill for anyone in sales —
particularly phone sales. And particularly phone sales in which
you’re responsible for your own schedule. Peter Drucker, the famous
management expert, said, “We can’t manage our time; we can only
manage ourselves.” Time management is self-management. The abil-
ity to control the distractions, procrastination, interruptions, and
low-priority activities in order to increase effectiveness separates
the top producers from the rest of the sales force.
A casual approach toward time may result in low production, incon-
sistent sales numbers, income fluctuation, and frustration — which
can lead to discouragement, or even termination. But if you recog-
nize time for what it is — a precious resource — you can use it to
your advantage to maximize your sales power. I call time a resource
because it’s something you invest in for an expected return. And
because you only have a limited supply of it — a nonrenewable
resource, if you will — the first step to better time management is 
to recognize the scarcity of time.

Making the most of your time requires urgency, focus, and intensity:
 Urgency attends to deadlines and goads you to accomplish 
a given task within a given time frame.
 Focus empowers you to think single-mindedly and drown 
out distractions — whether the chatter of other telephone
salespeople, e-mails, inbound problem calls, or mindless
administrative tasks.
 Intensity helps you overcome the inclination to procrastinate.
By exercising these three traits and enhancing them with some 
time-tested self-management tools, you can find yourself accom-
plishing dramatically more in less time — which translates to more
sales success and increased revenue. This chapter tells you how.
Acquainting Yourself 
with the 80/20 Rule
In 1895, Vilfredo Pareto articulated what he observed as a universal
phenomenon. In his home country of Italy, he saw that a small 
contingency of citizens — 20 percent — held most of the power,
influence, and money — about 80 percent of the power, he figured.
He described these people as the vital few. That, of course, meant
that the other 80 percent of the population held only 20 percent of
the financial and political power in the country.
This principal became known as the 80/20 Rule (also known as 
the Pareto Principle), and can be applied to almost any situation. 
I’ve heard it used in nonprofit groups (“20 percent of our volunteers
do 80 percent of the work”), the workplace (“20 percent of my staff
make 80 percent of the revenue”), and even by investors (“20 per-
cent of my stocks generate 80 percent of my income”).
The 80/20 Rule works when we’re talking about time, as well: 20 
percent of the activities you invest your time in generate 80 percent
of your achievement. In the world of telephone sales, those who
consistently earn the high incomes know how to work the 80/20
Rule to perfection. They have monitored, watched, evaluated, 
and determined what 20 percent of their time and efforts bring in 
80 percent of their income.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
80

The better you are at applying the 80/20 Rule to your own sales
efforts — not to mention all areas of your life — the more successful
you will be. The secret to this success, however, is finding out on
what and how you should be investing your time in order to achieve
the 80-percent return. I introduce the basics of the 80/20 Rule in the
following sections.
Determining where your 
time currently goes
Anybody can make the 80/20 Rule work for them. But not before
they understand exactly how they’re currently spending their time.
This understanding may require an upfront time investment — say, 
a week — to record and track where the time goes.
For at least five working days, keep a running tab of your daily
activities. Track everything: the review of your date book, the water
cooler chat with colleagues, your follow-up calls to resolve problems
with an account, your prospecting efforts, and your sales calls. Chop
up your day into 15-minute increments — no bigger — and account
for each quarter-hour.
A handy schedule for this task has lines for each quarter hour so
you can fill in the activity you performed. Each entry notes whether
the activity falls under the category of direct income–producing
activities (DIPA) or production-supporting activities (PSA), both of
which I cover in more detail later in this chapter. The schedule 
concludes with spaces for total hours spent on DIPA and PSA. (You
can create your own schedule; I’ve started one for you in Figure 7-1
to show you what it looks like.)
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 81
Condensing seven days into four
My focus and productivity intensified when I went from seven days of work to six
days, and then to five days. I experienced the largest production increase, however,
when I went to a four-day workweek. My wife, Joan, and I were constructing a
vacation home some three hours away in Bend, Oregon. Because Joan was the
general contractor, we had to be in Bend every Friday to check on the progress. We
did that throughout the eight months of construction. After the home was done, 
I decided not to revert back to working five days a week. I didn’t need to. Through
intensity, urgency, and focus, I was able to accomplish as much in four days as 
I had previously in five. And we’ve continued with our lifestyle, driving to Bend every
Thursday late afternoon and coming home Sunday.

Figure 7-1: Keep track of your days in 15-minute blocks to see how you 
spend your time.
In tracking your time every 15 minutes, you want to be able to 
separate your direct income–producing activities like prospecting,
lead follow-up, and presentation appointments from all the other
things you do. You want to track your PSA compared to your DIPA.
Ask yourself how much time is spent on DIPA versus PSA. Do PSA
take over a time of your day? What are the changes you need to
make to increase your DIPA time by at least 20 percent right now?
At the end of a week, you’ll have a pretty accurate read on where
you allot your efforts. This critical piece of evidence can then help
you to take the next step: redirecting your time into revenue-
producing activities.

Identifying the tasks 
that matter most
A salesperson’s time is spent in two areas:
 Creating new customers
 Serving current customers
I often ask telephone salespeople, “If you had to select only one area
to be exceptional at, which would you choose?” Well, you must be
skilled at both. But of the two, creating customers is undeniably the
more critical effort. Many salespeople are skilled at keeping their
customers happy. These service-oriented folks hope that through
their attentiveness, their customers will send more business their
way, and that’s good. But it’s a risky basket to put all your eggs in —
especially if it results in neglecting the development of new
customers.
As a salesperson, you must invest time daily, regularly, in creating
new customers through outbound prospecting. This is the 20 per-
cent of your time that will bring you the 80 percent of your income.
Nothing is more important than investing your time in creating new
leads, pursuing prospects, and following up on potential opportuni-
ties — all efforts that result in more customers. The creation of new
customers qualifies as a direct income–producing activity; I discuss
the importance of such activities later in this chapter. (For more on
prospecting, check out Chapter 5.)
Turning time from enemy to ally
Telephone sales is a demanding job. An eight-hour day of prospect-
ing, following up on leads, delivering presentations, handling objec-
tions, and closing sales can wear you down faster than a 100-meter
dash. Few people have the stamina to maintain a high level of focus
and performance for eight hours or more every day. In the following
sections, I explain how to figure out your peak performance period
so you can accomplish more in less time and stick to the 80/20 Rule.
Discovering your peak performance period
Whether you’re a night owl, early bird, or reach your peak at some
point in between, identifying your highest-performance period and
scheduling your most important tasks (in other words, those related
to creating customers) at that time is a tried-and-true technique to
rev up your productivity and boost your sales numbers.
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 83

Decide when you have the most energy during the day. When are
you more focused, and when does your mind wander? Most people
tend to have more energy, intensity, and focus during a certain time
of day. Mine happens to be in the morning. The middle of the after-
noon — when my energy level is lower — is my down time. I’m just
not as effective at prospecting at that time. And I’ve met hundreds 
of telephone salespeople just like me.
The solution for us early birds is to concentrate our mornings on
creating clients, and reserve the afternoons — when we have less
energy — for client service. Those who spend all morning struggling
to wake up, but then come alive in the afternoon, want to flip-flop
this schedule.
Pre-empting the 11 a.m. Rule
It’s uncanny, but no matter what time zone you live in, it seems the
world starts delivering problems and challenges to your doorstep
just before mid-day. This phenomenon is known as the 11 a.m. Rule.
So to pre-empt those troubles that could derail a productive day, get
as much of your lead generation and prospecting done first thing.
The more you can accomplish before 11 a.m., the higher your 
productivity rises.
And if 11 a.m. is the start of your peak period, you can protect your
time with a couple of strategies:
 In some telephone-sales jobs, particularly in the insurance,
finance, mortgage, and real estate sectors, salespeople must 
be available to clients to resolve problems and answer ques-
tions. To minimize distractions during high-production hours,
it’s okay not to answer the phone. Your voice mail message 
can assure callers that you will return calls after a certain time.
By doing so, you’ve created a win-win solution: Your customers 
are comfortable that their needs will be met in a reasonable
timeframe — and you haven’t sacrificed your productivity.
 You can move your paperwork and servicing segments to
later in the day. If you need to research information for a
prospect or write a business letter, do it after 11 a.m. to
increase your effectiveness.
Separating High-Return Activities
from Other Tasks
Champion performers in any field quickly discover which actions
account for the great majority — the 80 percent — of the results
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
84

they achieve. They save their best time of day for the activities that
result in the highest return on investment, while minimizing the 
time they spend on required activities that take up a lot of time.
Targeting direct income–
producing activities
I describe high-return activities as direct income–producing activities
(DIPA). In the world of sales, for example, DIPA might include:
 Prospecting (see Chapter 5)
 Lead follow-up
 Sales presentations (see Chapter 12)
 Practicing, role-playing, and rehearsing your sales skills
 Writing and negotiating contracts
As an example, in order to make it in an entrepreneurial sales 
field such as real estate, insurance, or financial services, you must
spend a minimum of 15 hours a week on these activities. An out-
standing salesperson goes beyond this — 30 percent, 40 percent,
and more. I have watched countless entrepreneurial salespeople
add $100, $200, even $300 to their per-hour value in less than six
months, simply by concentrating on and devoting more hours per
day on DIPA.
Checking out other necessary 
(but time-draining) activities
In addition to DIPA, telephone salespeople have two other job
activity categories:
 Indirect income– producing activities (IIPA): These tasks 
help create income, but not in a direct way. Developing a sales
brochure or a mailing for consumers and placing an advertise-
ment in the local paper are examples. Although mailings, ads,
and sales materials are certainly important to making sales,
they can’t be tied to revenue the way a one-on-one sales 
closure can.
 Production-supporting activities (PSA): These involve
follow-up service to clients. After you make the sale, the
faxing, copying, filing, and letter writing are required. This
type of activity also includes all the phone calls taken from
clients who have questions about their purchase.
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 85

Of course, IIPA and PSA are as much a fact of telephone-sales life 
as DIPA — although they’re often the activities that cause the most
stress, frustration, and challenges. But the more you can accomplish
these tasks in a minimum amount of time, the more effort you can
invest in those activities that directly bring in revenue (read more
about these in the preceding section).
IIPA and PSA may be hazardous to your schedule! To keep the indi-
rect and support activities from hijacking your time, schedule them
during your low-energy periods of the day. And during the time the
11 a.m. Rule is likely to sabotage your day. After all, what better time
to devote to serving your customers than when your customers are
most likely to be contacting you? These strategies help keep peak
performance slots reserved for DIPA — and DIPA only. (See the ear-
lier section “Turning time from enemy to ally” for details about
adjusting your schedule to your peak performance time.)
Time Blocking: A Way of Life 
for Winning Salespeople
In my company, Sales Champions, we offer many valuable time-
management tools to the sales professionals we coach. But figuring
out how to time block, our program alumni tell us, is the most life-
changing. Time blocking is prescheduling your day’s activities in
segments of time. When the concept of time blocking clicks in for
salespeople, it not only increases their sales success, but it also
influences all aspects of their lives. When they apply time blocking
to workout time, spiritual time, social time, children time, and rela-
tionship time, they often experience a positive shift that results in
a healthier balance — a lifestyle that more accurately reflects their
values and priorities.
For the telephone salesperson, time blocking is certain to take 
the process of task prioritization to the next level, leading to
higher sales numbers and — perhaps — a career-improving
change.
The first step toward effective time blocking is to grid your day 
into 15-minute increments. Why 15 minutes? For an effective sales-
person, time is of great value — even 15 minutes can represent a lot
of revenue and production. Losing even two or three of these small
blocks could represent hundreds of dollars. As you work through
this section and discover more about time blocking, you can use 
the schedule in Figure 7-2.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
86

Figure 7-2: Block time in 15-minute increments for maximum effectiveness.
Achievement-oriented sales folks tend to follow the “squeeze-it-in”
philosophy of scheduling: They cram everything they possibly can
onto their calendar — and then some. It’s important, however, to
attack the process of time blocking in the right order, scheduling
first things first. And speaking of first things first, Steven Covey, 
in his book of the same name, uses “big rocks” as a metaphor for
people’s most important priorities and values. (See the nearby
sidebar “Putting the big rocks first” for more details.)
What are the big rocks in your life? Time with loved ones? A worthy
cause? Your faith, education, or future plans? Providing for your
family? Mentoring others? Whatever they are, it’s critical to put your
big rocks first in order to make time blocking work for you. That
means identifying your most important priorities — not just at work,
but in life — and blocking out time for them before filling in your day
with tasks and activities that don’t support those priorities. The 
following sections show how many may go about time blocking 
their week.

Block out the most important 
personal time
Whatever your personal priorities — workout time, prayer 
time, quiet time, family time, kids’ sports events — block these
into your weekly schedule first. Doing so gives weight to these
activities and ensures that they won’t be usurped by an obligation 
of lesser importance. There’s nothing wrong with telling a client 
that you’re not available for an evening appointment if you’ve 
scheduled that time for your family. You merely need to say that
you’re booked at that time.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
88
Putting the big rocks first
When Steven Covey and A. Roger Merrill used this story in their book First Things
First (Simon & Schuster), they didn’t cite the source. But its message is powerful
and worth my re-telling it here:
One day an expert in time management was speaking to a group of business stu-
dents. Standing before the group of high-powered overachievers, he said, “Okay,
time for a quiz.” He pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouthed Mason jar and set it on
a table in front of him. Then he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and care-
fully placed them, one at a time, into the jar. When the jar was filled to the top, and
no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, “Is this jar full?” Everyone in the class
said, “Yes.” He said, “Really?”
He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. He dumped some
gravel in and shook the jar, causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into
the spaces between the big rocks. He asked the group once more, “Is the jar full?”
This time the class was on to him. “Probably not,” one of them answered. “Good!”
he replied.
He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping
in the sand, and it went into all the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel.
Once more, he asked the question, “Is the jar full?” “No!” the class shouted. Once
again, he said, “Good!”
Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to
the brim. He looked up at the class and asked, “What is the point of this illustra-
tion?” One eager beaver raised his hand and said, “The point is, no matter how full
your schedule is, if you try really hard, you can always fit some more things into it!”
“No,” the speaker replied. “The truth this illustration teaches us is if you don’t put
the big rocks in first, you’ll never get them in at all.”

Reserve days off
I personally believe two days off each week is best, but schedule 
at least one day — one entire day — off. This means no calls, no
checking e-mails, no going through the mail, no working on a pro-
posal. Time off is meant for relaxing and recharging. And a regular
charging of your batteries is absolutely essential for your work
productivity: The more re-energized you are after time off, the
more you can focus on and achieve your work goals.
Block out evening time
By blocking out your nights each week, you help ensure a reason-
able end to your workday. Of course, you sometimes need to put in
extra hours or schedule an evening appointment. But make it some-
thing you control. You might, for example, leave Tuesdays and
Thursdays open for appointments or to catch up on paperwork,
and block out the rest of your evenings for family or fun time.
Schedule all other personal time
I work out every morning. I always block that time on my weekly
calendar. Reading, study, yoga, or a pedicure — whatever your 
personal avocations or interests are — are important enough not 
to leave to chance. Don’t assume, for instance, that you’ll simply
squeeze in the time necessary to read Catcher in the Rye for your
book club. Schedule it.
Schedule direct income–
producing activities
After you’ve scheduled your personal priorities and family time 
(see previous sections), you must then start blocking out work 
priorities. As I emphasize throughout this chapter, generating sales
is the most important priority to the telephone salesperson. And 
in order to do so, the sales pro must do direct income–producing
activities first (I cover these activities earlier in this chapter).
Blocking 90 minutes for prospecting and an hour for lead 
follow-up each day is a good rule.
For most people, mornings are the best time for prospecting and
lead follow-up. I advise scheduling these tasks first thing. That way,
you don’t put off your most critical activities until you’re too tired
to give it your best. If your best time mentally is in the afternoon,
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 89

then block your direct income–producing activities there. However,
completing them at that time will be harder, due to the 11 a.m. Rule
that I discuss earlier in this chapter. You may have to fight harder
for your protected prospecting time in the afternoon.
Add appointments
Not only is blocking out your existing appointments (frequently
DIPA related) important, but also, you must develop a consistent
structure to your appointment scheduling. This way, you can offer
choices to your clients while still maintaining control over your own
schedule.
For example, my typical sales presentation was no more than 
45 minutes, so I made my appointments in one-hour increments,
allowing 15 minutes of drive time between appointments. I set
appointments at 3:15, 4:15, and 5:15 Monday through Thursday. 
On Tuesday evenings, I also had 6:15, 7:15, and 8:15 slots.
Because I operated with specific appointment times, I had more
control of my schedule. Instead of asking a client when she could
meet, I offered a choice: “Sue, which would work better for you —
4:15 on Monday or Tuesday?” If Sue said she couldn’t get home
until 4:30, I’d move her to a 5:15 slot.
Work in time to return calls
You can count on accumulating calls that must be returned, so block
time daily. Schedule one time segment for late morning — allowing
you to concentrate on the DIPA tasks without anxiety. You may also
want to schedule another “return-call” block toward the end of the
day to catch up on all the calls you may have missed during a busy
afternoon. This block of time should be about 30 minutes. You want
to try to keep the return phone call less than 10 minutes.
Schedule ongoing production-
supporting activities
All administrative and customer-relations tasks require regular
attention. Although I maintain that these PSAs are secondary to gen-
erating sales, they must still be accomplished. Scheduling adequate
time to stay on top of ongoing service activities ensures that they
don’t get pushed to the schedule for the next week. And the next
week. And the next week.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
90

Your sales process and client servicing greatly influence the amount
of time you spend in PSAs. Some salespeople do a lot of servicing.
Some salespeople hand the servicing over to another department.
The real truth is to invest as little in PSAs as you can while keeping
your client happy. (I go over the basics of PSAs earlier in this 
chapter.)
Set aside time for staff
If you have direct reports, your job responsibilities include coach-
ing and supporting others. Schedule the necessary one-on-one and
meeting times to ensure you stay on top of staff productivity and
performance. Block on your schedule brief daily “touch-base” chats
with individuals as well as weekly meetings with the whole staff.
Take emergencies into account
Some flexibility is essential in order to keep to a time block 
schedule. For every two to three hours of productive time per 
day, schedule 30 minutes of “emergency” time. In case an appoint-
ment runs late or some other glitch derails your day, you’ve got 
a half-hour leeway to get back on task.
Putting the “Now” before 
the “Later” with Daily 
To-Do Lists
Daily to-do lists help the telephone-sales professional meet sales
objectives. Sometimes, you just don’t have enough time in the day
to get everything done. That’s why it’s necessary to identify which
tasks are the most important. The process of organizing your to-do
list in order of importance is called prioritizing.
Many people make daily lists, which is a good start. But as the 
day goes on, they get into trouble and don’t even know it. Why?
Because they see accomplishment as crossing off as many items
on the list as possible. They measure success in quantity. But 
what really counts isn’t how many tasks you cross off, but what
you cross off. When creating a daily task list, put all the tasks in 
for the day. Don’t just list the sales tasks, but the servicing tasks,
as well.
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 91

The following is a powerfully effective prioritization system that
can take your task list making to the next level:
1. Write down all your tasks (in no particular order).
To set effective priorities, create your list as you normally
would. Don’t worry about which tasks are most important . . .
yet. Concern yourself only with what needs to be done. This
is the brainstorming stage: Just get it all down on paper.
2. Categorize tasks according to their importance for the
day.
Wait! Don’t start prioritizing in 1-2-3 order. At this stage,
you group your listed tasks in A-B-C-D-E categories accord-
ing to these criteria:
A: Items that have a significant negative consequence if
they’re not completed today
B: Tasks that have a mild negative consequence if not
completed today
C: Actions that, if not done today, won’t cause any nega-
tive consequences
D: Tasks that can be delegated
E: Items that can be eliminated
3. Prioritize the tasks within the categories from Step 2.
Start with the A category and determine which item has the
highest priority. Designate this as A-1, followed by the next
most important item, A-2, then A-3, A-4, and so forth. Repeat
this process for the B, C, and D categories. You don’t need
to prioritize the E category because you need to eliminate
these items. Your list is now accurately prioritized, and you
can start accomplishing each item, confident that if you run
out of time at the end of the day, you’ve at least finished the
most important items on your list. And, best off all, no 
negative consequences!
Don’t expect to complete as large a volume of cross-offs as 
you may be used to. Because you’re doing more important items,
which likely take more time, you may not be able to get as many
tasks completed. In my view, however, the measure of a great day 
is whether you achieve closure on all the A-category items. If you
follow this system for a year and complete only the A items each
day, you will see your production and income explode. How is this
possible? Because the B, C, and D items quickly work their way up 
to As — and you always get the most important things done!

Making Each Day a Time-
Management “10”
A day that rates as a perfect “10” doesn’t just happen. Oh, sure, a
can-do attitude is important, but it takes a concerted effort to keep
a productive day on track. Time management offers some valuable
tools in constructing a high-scoring day.
Managing distractions 
and interruptions
Your best-laid plans can go awry when external forces scheme
against the productive schedule you’ve set for yourself. Your office
mate wants to tell you all about his weekend. Your phone keeps ring-
ing. Your e-mail program signals that you’ve got more messages. The
conversation out in the hall makes it hard to hear your prospect on
the phone.
The best way to handle interruptions is to stop them from happen-
ing in the first place. Because the most critical time is DIPA time, it’s
helpful to establish some preemptive strategies during this period of
your day. Just a few of the steps you can take to avoid interruptions
include:
 Turning off your cellphone
 Asking the receptionist to hold all calls or forward them to
your voice mail
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 93
Questioning the status quo
My friend Zig Ziglar tells a story about a little boy watching his mother prepare a
holiday meal. He asks her why she cuts off the end of the ham. She says this to him,
“I don’t know. My mother always did it this way.” Now this 5-year-old boy (the
reason I know he was 5 is that my son Wesley is 5, and he would say the exact same
thing) says, “Let’s call Grandma right now and find out why.” So they call Grandma
and ask her why she always cut the end of the ham off. Her reply? “The pan was too
small!”
People often continue to do their jobs a certain way because “that’s the way I’ve
always done it.” Sometimes the original reason for doing it no longer has any 
relevance. Critically questioning the status quo can help identify and eliminate 
needless tasks, freeing up your energy for more important activities.

 Turning off your e-mail program so the you’ve-got-mail icon
doesn’t distract you
 Signing out of your instant message program
 Closing your office door
 Hanging a Do-Not-Disturb sign on your door or cubicle
entrance
Do whatever it takes to stay on track. In most cases, when you
explain to your colleagues, clients, family, or boss that this is a criti-
cal production time for you, and you give them a specific time when
you can get back to them, they’re more than happy to let you be.
Keeping calls short ’n’ sweet
Telephone sales is a numbers game: The more calls you make, 
the more money you can earn. So it goes to reason that the shorter
the call, the more calls you can make. A good practice is to keep 
customer-service calls and PSA calls as brief as possible.
Tell your sales contact that you have another appointment in 15
minutes (and if you follow the advice on time blocking earlier in this
chapter, you should have another appointment in 15 minutes!), but
you felt it was important to get in touch as quickly as you could.
This technique tells the person two things:
 That the situation must be resolved quickly (diverting unpro-
ductive chit-chat)
 That the client is so highly valued that you’re making time for
the call even with your full schedule
Assure the client that 15 minutes is more than enough time — and
if not, you’ll set aside time later that day to talk again. The truth is,
however, I’ve never had to talk with the client later — we always
manage to resolve the issues in the first call.
With prospects, you want to speak with the person directly — it’s
the only way to drive them to a face-to-face meeting or make the sale
on the phone efficiently. But PSA calls are another story: Take advan-
tage of voice mail at every opportunity. This allows you to answer
questions without a time-consuming conversation. Of course, you
want to give them the option to call you back. Here’s a good script
to use in that case:
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Telephone-Sales Success 
94

“Bob, I know that you are very busy. I believe that this resolves
the issue. If you agree, there is no reason to call me back. If you
do need to speak with me, I will be available later today between
3:30 and 4:15. Please call me then.”
Getting a head start on the next day
A perfect “10” day is born the previous day, created through strate-
gic setup. At the end of your workday, take 10 to 15 minutes before
you go home to review your calls for tomorrow. Who are the leads
you need to reach? What presentation appointments are on your
schedule? Are you prepared — or do you need to invest more time?
For each call, make sure you have all the information you need on
that prospect and that you have everything you need to answer
their questions. This brief time investment to review, arrange, 
analyze, and create your strategy increases the likelihood that
tomorrow will rate a “10.”
“Seasonalizing” your schedule
Most businesses follow a predictable seasonal pattern of ups and
downs. Maybe sales for your business are flat or declining as you
approach the holiday season, or possibly, the holidays are your
biggest time of the year. Breaking down sales results from quar-
terly or seasonally to monthly to weekly to daily also produces an
enhanced urgency that results in better time usage. The daily focus
on calls, contacts, leads, appointments, and presentations shows 
up first when a salesperson is off the mark.
Look at historical sales patterns for your company. Recognize that
you may want to pattern your hours invested to match historical
sales data. You may work longer hours in the high sales weeks and
months and decrease your hours or plan for vacation time when
sales are historically slow. I have traditionally taken off the last
week of the year for close to 20 years. I found that sales were very
low the last week of the year for my sales business. The return for
the investment of time wasn’t warranted.
At Sales Champions, each of our telephone salespeople has a 
specific annual income goal, reflecting a mix of products and serv-
ices broken down by season. By factoring in the seasonal swings,
our sales staff is more likely to stay on course. If the sales goals were
spread out flat, some who merely hit the modest goals for a busy
season would certainly face more challenge in making them up
during the times when sales are more challenging.
Chapter 7: Investing Your Time Wisely 95

Using your car as a classroom
One of my greatest vehicles for higher learning? My car. In my early
sales years, I turned it into my learning classroom. Spending hours
in my car every day was an opportunity to expand my knowledge
and grow professionally. I was never in my car without a tape or CD
playing. Not music, but rather lessons on sales skills, motivational
messages, and advice from the sales world’s most renowned
experts.
I am a long-time supporter of the auto-university. Those of us in the
world of sales tend to spend large quantities of time in our vehicles.
Having an educational CD or CD series playing helps improve your
learning curve as you’re maneuvering your sales routes.
I’m convinced that the time I spent in my own auto-university is one
of the key reasons I’ve achieved the levels of success that I enjoy
today. You’re success-minded, too, or you wouldn’t have invested in
this book. Turning your travel time into learning time enriches your
long-term growth in addition to boosting your day’s value to a “10.”
Putting off procrastination
Falling into the procrastination trap is easy. Too many available
working hours leads to a lack of urgency, which leads to the I-can-
do-it-later syndrome. Defining a clear line between prioritization and
procrastination is critical to making the most of your time. Setting
precise deadlines — and adhering to them — stops procrastination
in its tracks. For success-minded individuals, deadlines drive 
performance.
Think about what happens the week before your vacation. If you’re
like me, just prior to your getaway, you’re typically operating on
overdrive to cross off all the to-do’s on your list. Why? You don’t
have an option. You don’t have tomorrow to catch up. Your vaca-
tion deadline creates an urgency that enhances your focus, action,
and intensity to a level you may rarely reach at other times.
Successful telephone salespeople apply that sense of urgency to 
all their deadlines. They resist the inclination to wait until a “better
time” to pick up the phone. They won’t permit themselves to make
excuses to postpone. They treat all deadlines with the same impor-
tance as they give a vacation. They live by the motto, “There is no
time like the present.” They take action, and they do it now.

Continuing to call, even 
when you’re down
Frustration. Stress. Burn-out. It’s a fact of telephone-sales life: At
some point in your professional work, you’re bound to confront
some “down” moments — times when you’d consider it a miracle 
to boost your day even to a “5.” At these times, you may be tempted
to give up on your time-management efforts, rationalizing that it
won’t do you any good to “stick with the program” when you’re 
in the dumps anyway.
My advice when this urge hits? Get on the phone! Just pick 
up the phone and do what a telephone salesperson does — 
call. If you’re feeling a bit insecure, then call your best clients. 
Hearing from satisfied customers is a sure cure against a case 
of the doubts. They’re pleased that you’re calling to check in on
them, and you gain from a boost to your confidence. Even one or
two positive calls to your best clients can turn the day from a big 
zero to something closer to a “10.”
Linking rewards and deadlines
Working the phone for appointments and sales is hard, taxing, 
even grinding — sometimes for long stretches. Most salespeople 
go through a drought or slump at least once in a calendar year.
Getting through the hard times can be tough, but rewards can help
soften the angst. Not commission-based rewards — which come
from successful sales efforts, of course — but personal incentives
that motivate you to stay the course and get past the slump.
Personal is the operative word. What’s an attractive “carrot” to keep
you committed to your schedule? A day at the spa? A long weekend
getaway? A new set of golf clubs? What are you willing to go the
extra mile for? Choose a reward that’s tailored to please you.
After you choose a reward, set short-term stakes. If the reward is 
too far away, it will lose its pull. The promise of a healthy retirement
fund isn’t going to motivate you to meet your daily objectives now.
Instead, a reward that dangles just a week or month away is more
likely to inspire you to make that additional phone call today — say,
treating yourself to an evening of fine dining Saturday night. Reward
yourself in small, meaningful ways for managing your time wisely
and hitting deadlines and production goals.

Part III
You Make the Call!

In this part . . .
You turned to this part ﬁrst, didn’t you? After all, the
call is the heart of telephone sales. And although
making a phone call may seem pretty straightforward,
consistently making sales calls that end in closes takes
more effort than simply letting your ﬁngers do the walk-
ing. These ﬁve jam-packed chapters guide you through
the sales call.
In Chapter 8, I give you tips for getting past even the most
militant gatekeeper. And even if you turn that bulldog of
an assistant into your staunchest ally, you still have to get
your foot in the door — so to speak — with the prospect.
In Chapter 9, I show you how to develop and use a power-
ful opening statement that’s sure to keep the prospect on
the line.
But be sure: Successful phone sales isn’t “show and tell.” In
fact, in Chapters 10 and 11, you discover that asking and
listening are skills that serve you better than telling and
selling. I also reveal the best questions to ask in order to
get a sale. And all that asking and listening is leading up
to your big scene (give me a drum roll, please): your sales
presentation. Chapter 12 holds the secrets for sliding
seamlessly from your supporting role as prospect confes-
sor to center stage, including the keys to effective delivery.

T
here I was, outside the castle gates — the drawbridge closed
tight. The moat was filled with crocodiles; the parapet armed by
legions poised with arrows and cauldrons of boiling oil. And inside
the keep, the treasure I sought was secure in an impenetrable tower,
guarded by the ruler of the land. . . .
No, I’m neither a weekend role-player at a Renaissance fair nor 
am I playing a Medieval-themed video game. I’m describing how 
it can feel for me — and leagues of telephone salespeople — when
calling a business to try to reach that all-powerful decision maker.
You know — the one who can grant the key to the kingdom’s riches.
Problem is, I have to pass the gatekeeper to attain those riches.
Getting past the gatekeeper is a constant challenge in reaching 
high-level decision makers. Recognize this, though: The more 
difficult getting beyond the gatekeeper is for you, the less likely
your competition has succeeded. This is great news. And, trust 
me, breaking through the gatekeeper gauntlet is possible. In this
chapter, I share the best battle strategies, from finding secret pas-
sages that lead to the decision maker to employing the passwords
that persuade the gatekeeper to let down the drawbridge.
Meeting the Three Gatekeepers
In order to keep you out of the castle, gatekeepers use all sorts 
of tactics, based on their individual position, experience, tempera-
ment, and relationship with the decision maker. Some, wearing
“company policy” as a suit of armor, are hard as nails to get past;

others aim to derail you through disinformation; some may even
disguise themselves as a decision maker, when all they’re really
empowered to do is to fool you into thinking you’re making
progress.
Typically, all gatekeepers fall into one of three general categories.
By recognizing them, you’re better equipped to circumvent their
efforts to block your passage.
The loyal assistant
Secretary. Administrative assistant. Personal assistant. Executive
aid. Even office manager. Gatekeepers with these titles invariably
have direct-report status and work very closely with the individual
you seek to reach. Each sees it as her mission to keep callers from
intruding on the boss. A loyal assistant frequently labels “intru-
sions” according to her own definition. The longer this individual
has worked with the boss or company, the stronger the loyalty
factor — and the greater the challenge to get past her.
The mid-level manager
Often, you make it past the initial gatekeeper — the loyal 
assistant — only to run into another gatekeeper. The assistant 
commonly directs you to someone with a title, someone who may
report to the decision maker you want to reach, but who doesn’t
have the authority to buy your product or service— usually 
some type of mid-level manager.
Mid-level managers are less driven by personal loyalty and more
concerned about whether they look good. They’re on their way up,
on their way down, or stuck. If you can persuade the mid-level man-
ager that your service or product is the key to her advancement —
or the salvation to his demise — you’ll have a strong advocate who
can help you reach the decision maker (see the section “Enlisting
the Gatekeeper as Your Ally” later in this chapter for more info).
Here are some clues to help you figure out which direction the 
mid-level manager is headed:
 The manager on the climb is your most likely ally — you’re
presenting a new and innovative idea that may save or make
the company money, which will make him look good.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
102

 Managers on the way down — or out — are more challenging.
Supporting something new isn’t what most managers on the
decline are focused on. If you do manage to convince them, you
must gain audience with the higher-ups. Why? If the down-and-
out manager presents your case, you run the risk that:
• His reputation will taint management’s view of your
product.
• His delivery may not position your product in the 
best light.
The imposter of importance
Ah, the toughest gatekeeper of them all — the employee who proj-
ects importance and power far beyond what she really possesses!
She may insist that you deal directly with her: send her all your
information and make the presentation to her.
The more she insists you deal with her the more likely she is an
imposter of importance, especially if when you ask her for her title,
she hesitates to tell you. She is often trying to come up with some
title that sounds more important than the one she currently 
possesses.
When you suspect you’ve encountered an imposter of importance,
you must probe, clarify, repeat, question, and even confront, if nec-
essary, as to the exact parameters of her role. Find out the answers
to the following questions:
 What does she typically do when a salesperson asks for 
her boss?
 Does the boss usually agree with her decision?
 How much weight does her opinion carry?
 How does she advise you to proceed?
 Even ask her outright if you had misinformation — is she 
the decision maker?
Her responses may need further dissection. Imposters often create
gray areas with phrases such as, “I am involved,” “I have a hand in,”
“I wield some influence,” or “I have some responsibility.” When you
hear responses that need further interpretation, feed them back for
clarification by using phrases such as the following:
Chapter 8: Getting Past the Gatekeeper 103

“What do you mean by _______________?”
“Can you clarify _______________?”
“Can you give me a little perspective on _______________?”
An imposter often backtracks, contradicts, or continues to be vague.
If you’re talking to the real decision maker, you should get clear-cut
responses that confirm authority.
Enlisting the Gatekeeper 
as Your Ally
The gatekeeper can stop you dead in your tracks, so it is wise 
to turn him into an internal advocate if you can. You will find 
techniques to do just that in this section.
Making a good first impression
Your first call to the gatekeeper is a little like trying to land a glider:
You can’t circle back for another pass. With that initial call, you set
the stage for the resistance level on future calls. If you’re dismissive,
you may crash and burn. If you come off as trying to schmooze the
gatekeeper, you’ll get the “sleazy salesperson” treatment.
Although you may feel as if gatekeepers exist to make your life 
difficult, keep in mind that they’re bombarded daily by a legion 
of vendors, clients, employees, and strangers — all trying to gain
audience with the person they work for. The gatekeepers may also
receive the message from these people (and possibly even their
boss) that they aren’t important. Your ability to treat the gate-
keeper with respect and reinforce his value, and — after all, 
he is very important to your efforts — can open doors.
Three techniques to convey your respect of the gatekeeper 
can be employed in the first phone contact:
 Say the person’s name. This signals that you recognize 
him beyond the role of assistant or employee. Use his name 
in all conversations and follow-up calls. If you’re not good
with names, add this critical detail to the prospect record.
(See Chapter 3 for details about keeping an accurate 
database of call activity.)
Part III: You Make the Call! 
104

 Promote the gatekeeper. Even if you know the title is 
“secretary” or “assistant,” refer to the individual as “office
manager” or “executive adviser.” This communicates that 
you recognize his critical role in the workings of the company.
Using these titles reinforces the gatekeeper’s value and
reduces the likelihood that he’ll push you off with the 
“I’m just the assistant” ploy.
 Ask for help. By soliciting the gatekeeper’s help, you say,
“You’re important to me” and “I rely on your knowledge,” both
positive and ego-boosting messages. Plus, the more you can
glean from her, the more effective you can be after you reach
the decision makers. You’re transferring and admitting the
power position that she currently has. It conveys respect.
Digging for information
Questions for the gatekeeper are one of your best tools for prying
open the gates that lead to the decision maker. Use the initial oppor-
tunity to establish, first, whether you’re reaching the right person,
using questions such as the following:
“Does Mr. Jones usually handle decisions regarding
_______________?”
“Who do you normally work with to provide _______________?”
“If you were me, how would you approach Mr. Big?”
Then fish for a little more detail to help tailor your efforts to the 
individuals (both the gatekeeper and the decision maker) you’re
working with. Some questions secure more information so you can
build a more spot-on presentation. Some may reveal shortcuts or
alternate routes to reaching the decision maker. Some are designed
to involve the gatekeeper and elicit support, and others simply keep
the gatekeeper on the line a little longer. However you use them, the
following questions are bound to garner more info for you to better
do your job:
“I know it’s challenging to anticipate his every move, but when
might be a good time to call him back?”
“Is she usually more available in the morning or the afternoon?”
“I would assume he is like most successful _______________ and
comes in early in the morning.”
“You certainly know her well. How does she approach decisions
such as _______________?”
“If you were in my shoes, what would you do?”
Chapter 8: Getting Past the Gatekeeper 105

If you get stuck, focus on results. Instead of talking about the
copiers you sell, zero in on desirable results: Ask the gatekeeper
what goals are important to the decision maker. Point out how you
have a solution that results in more effective presentations, greater
office productivity, and money savings. A responsible gatekeeper
will surely want the boss to hear about that.
Always get the gatekeeper’s extension number. Why? The boss’s
extension is often one digit more or one digit less than the gate-
keeper’s. This information allows you to attempt to reach the deci-
sion maker directly — your best bet is to try before or after official
work hours, in hopes of catching the boss when the gatekeeper 
is out.
Asking for help
Believe it or not, when asked, most people are only too eager to
help. Recruiting the gatekeeper as an ally instead of an adversary
is an extremely under-utilized but effective technique for getting
through to the decision maker. Enlist the gatekeeper’s support with
lines such as
“May I ask a favor of you?”
“Can you help me out?”
“I would really appreciate your assistance.”
“I know you are extremely busy, but could you advise me?”
“I know your time is valuable, and I hesitate to ask because 
of that, but . . .”
To pack this tactic with added punch, be sure to tack on the 
gatekeeper’s name to the beginning of your request, as I explain 
in the earlier section “Making a good first impression.”
Providing an out
I consider this method a master technique. One of the most reliable
ways to elicit the help of gatekeeper is to offer an “out.” I call it the
pressure release technique because it takes the pressure off the gate-
keeper by allowing him to say no. Here’s how it works — you say
something like:
“I understand if you can’t, but is it possible to . . .?”
Part III: You Make the Call! 
106

Of course, the beauty of this technique is that giving the individual
permission to refuse your request makes him all the more eager to
grant you the favor. The best pressure release statement is, “I under-
stand if you can’t.” Link this with, “I have a favor to ask,” and you’ve
got a virtual battering-ram’s chance of getting in the door. Odds are
good that the gatekeeper will drop his defenses and let down 
the barriers.
Avoiding Sidetrack Sabotage
One of the gatekeeper’s most trusted methods of sabotage is to
throw decoys in your path. Gatekeepers have an arsenal of these
diversions. You may be hit with one on your first call and bom-
barded with different ones at each subsequent effort. It may even
start before you get to the gatekeeper — the receptionist may be 
in on the subterfuge, too!
If you get sidetracked at the front door, here’s a tactic to get 
past the receptionist: When asked to hold, respond by saying
something like, “Holding for Mr. Jones, please.” Most phone sys-
tems re-ring the receptionist after a caller has been on hold for
some time. A busy receptionist may believe she has “screened”
your call earlier and then simply put you through to the decision
maker! Look out for the following common decoys as well.
“Send us your brochure”
This brush-off is a favored ruse among those who like to avoid con-
frontation. It allows the gatekeeper to postpone, diminish, or avoid
rejecting you outright. The gatekeeper appears to be opening the
door, but in reality he knows that few salespeople actually follow up.
And if they do, an envelope is a lot easier to deflect than a person.
This method only works if you, the salesperson, allow it to work.
Or you can turn the tables and use the gatekeeper’s decoy as an
opening to collect more information about the decision maker’s
needs by using the following method:
“The truth is, one of the reasons for my call is to be able to send
more information to Mr. Jones in the near future. I wouldn’t want
to waste Mr. Jones’s time by sending something that doesn’t apply
to your needs. Can we take another few minutes, so I can ask a
few more questions about _______________?”
Chapter 8: Getting Past the Gatekeeper 107

This technique moves you away from “send me your brochure”
and back to your fact-finding mission (for more on this, see the
section “Digging for information” earlier in this chapter).
“Mr. Decision Maker is busy right
now; can I take a message?”
One would hope Mr. Decision Maker is busy doing something.
Although your prospect is unlikely to be flossing his teeth when
you call, be prepared to hear this type of response. What might
you not be prepared for? If the gatekeeper has anything to do with 
it, Mr. Decision Maker may be too busy to ever get your message.
One of the primary duties of the gatekeeper is to protect the boss
from unscheduled intrusions. Although, technically, the gatekeeper
takes the message, the likelihood is slim that the gatekeeper will
actually give the message.
To keep your message from being written in invisible ink, you may
need to employ this strategy — respond to the request in this way:
“Sure, but before you take the time to do that, can I ask you a few
questions to make sure that Mr. Jones even needs to call me back?”
What you’re saying is, “I’m giving you the power to decide whether 
I call back again.” Now, you will, of course, call back again. But if you
use this technique successfully, you can often move from a message
to an appointment with the boss.
However, if this first technique doesn’t work and the gatekeeper
continues to press you to leave a message, ask for a time and date
when you can call back and be assured of reaching the decision
maker instead of simply leaving a message for a return phone call.
Make it as difficult as possible for the gatekeeper to find an excuse
to refuse your request. Ask for a small amount of time: 15 — even
just 5 — minutes. Check out the following examples:
“I can appreciate that Mr. Jones is busy. You sound like the person
responsible for handling his schedule. Does he have an opening of
15 minutes on Wednesday or Thursday when we could talk?”
“I understand his schedule is full; mine is full, as well. In the inter-
est of saving time, is he available on Thursday in the morning or
afternoon to speak with me for 15 minutes?”
Part III: You Make the Call! 
108

Before you hang up, see whether the gatekeeper will tell you what’s
scheduled after your phone appointment. Knowing what comes
next gives you a sense of whether the call could be extended — or
whether the call must be kept to a certain length. Later in the call,
you can impress the prospect with your respect for her time with
comments such as the following:
“I know you have a meeting in a few minutes, so could we finish
our call _______________ or _______________?”
Another Gatekeeper: Using Voice
Mail to Your Advantage
Many executives use voice mail to screen out callers. Inept and
unscripted voice mail messages don’t generate return calls. Leave
a bad voice mail message, and you can anticipate an even greater
buildup of the ramparts.
But just as you can turn an executive assistant into your ally, you
can use voice mail to your benefit. Just think: Even if the live conduit
in the company refuses to pass on your messages, you can count on
voice mail to deliver a well-crafted message — exactly as you want 
it delivered. I provide some guidance in the following sections.
Following five steps to 
a powerful message
Just as effective live conversations with sales prospects are built 
of important component parts, the voice mail message must also 
be carefully constructed, as you find out in the following sections.
Even though you may serve customers with varying needs, you can
easily come up with a basic voice mail template you can customize,
of course, when you have insider information to tailor it.
Here are some crucial guidelines for a productive working 
relationship with voice mail:
 Keep your messages 15 to 30 seconds.
 Be prepared. Have a script at hand; if you stumble, mumble,
and bumble in the message, you’re worse off than if you leave
no message at all. I can’t overemphasize how important being
prepared really is.
Chapter 8: Getting Past the Gatekeeper 109

 Take advantage of voice mail features such as the replay-
and-rerecord function.
 Ramp up your energy level to deliver with passion and 
enthusiasm. (If you sound like a sleep-aid commercial, 
delete and repeat!)
 Smile when you leave voice mail messages. It can’t sound 
like the 50th message that you have left today.
Provide your name, rank, and phone number
Launch the call by identifying yourself. State your name, company,
rank, and phone number. Because of unreliable reception quality of
voice mail, speak with greater clarity in your voice. Relay this criti-
cal information slowly and carefully. If the recipient must replay the
message several times to decipher the details, well . . . she probably
won’t do it.
Construct an attention-getting bridge
Before diving right into the heart of your message, ease your 
way in with a one-of-a-kind warm-up phrase. Most salespeople say
something like “I’m sorry I missed you.” Don’t you do it! Instead, 
try a fresh approach:
“It’s a pleasure to leave you this message today.”
“Since our last discussion. . . .”
“Since my last voice mail. . . .”
“I am certain you recognize my voice by now.”
State your purpose — with an accent on benefits
“The reason for my call . . . ” is an obvious but also extremely effec-
tive introduction to the crux of your call. These words signal that
it’s time for the recipient to tune in. At this point, you’re presenting
the benefits, the opportunity, and the critical details you hope will
hook the prospect into returning your call and asking for feedback.
You want to spotlight benefits for the recipient, of course — 
benefits that you’re at the ready to offer. Don’t confuse benefits
with your laundry list of products and services. The prospect
already knows, for example, what an office equipment company
sells. Instead of running through your catalog of products, offer
results: for example, more just-in-time business opportunities
because of faster turnaround, or 24/7 maintenance service means 
no downtime, ever. The individual who listens to your message
ought to hear how your product or service can help boost sales,
decrease costs, or increase productivity.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
110

The objective of stating your purpose is to increase urgency. 
Here’s an example:
“The reason for my call is to alert you to three strategic benefits we
provide our clients: reducing duplication service costs; increasing
quality in promotional and presentation materials; and increasing
staff productivity with the walk-away feature on our machines.
Which of these services is most important to you?”
This segment of the voice mail message is what changes most as
you make additional follow-up calls to that prospect (see the later
section “Setting a six-call limit” for more information).
Specify a call to action
A compelling message also contains a call to action. Saying “I called;
tag, you’re it,” just doesn’t cut it. Be specific about the next step:
“Please call me back tomorrow between 10 and 3.”
“Please be on the lookout for an information packet I’ve 
dropped in the mail for you.”
“I will try you again tomorrow. If another time is more 
convenient, please feel free to call me at. . . .”
Close the call
Restate your name, company name, and phone number at the end
of your voice mail message. The recipient may not have jotted it
down earlier, and this saves her the trouble of replaying your mes-
sage. Then end with a sincere thank you. Expressing appreciation
for her time is a solid strategy, showing courtesy and respect to
the listener.
Setting a six-call limit
Through years of testing, research, monitoring thousands of calls,
and analyzing my own track record, I’ve hit upon six as the magic
limit for leaving sales messages on voice mail to the same prospect
in a few weeks’ period. When you go beyond this number, you’re
past the peak and looking at diminishing returns.
But by no means should you be leaving the same message with
each call! If the prospect didn’t call back after the first two “Sorry 
I missed you” efforts, what makes you think he will respond to the
third, fourth, fifth, or sixth?
Chapter 8: Getting Past the Gatekeeper 111

Develop your first benefits-oriented message, and then script five
more messages that build on the previous efforts — with new detail,
more benefits, and increasing urgency. With varying messages,
you’re more likely to hit the prospect’s hot button.
Don’t neglect to use the insider information you acquired through
the gatekeeper or through your earlier research (see previous sec-
tions for more on this). If you can insert the insider information in
the general scripting, the call-back rate climbs even higher.

Call with Ease
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the seven-second rule for opening statements
 Writing your opening statement
 Delivering a winning opener
 Steering clear of opening pitfalls
 Preparing an elevator speech as the foundation for opening statements
You may have heard the saying “You never get a second 
chance to make a good first impression.” This oft-repeated
axiom is never truer than when selling over the phone, where the
full weight of your sales success hangs on your first words. You
can’t rely on your physical presence, the benefit of reading body
language, or the ability to hold the individual with eye contact as
you can when you make your case face to face. If you don’t hook
the prospect within your first few sentences, your odds of seeing
the sale through to the close shrink faster than the time it takes
your prospect to say good-bye or to hang up.
And as much as you want to think otherwise, most folks don’t
eagerly await the ringing of the phone in hopes of hearing from a
salesperson — even if they really need and want certain products 
or services. When they stop to answer the phone in the middle of 
a busy day, they’re not likely to be receptive to a message that 
translates as, “I want to sell you something.”
Of course, you would never start a sales call in that manner. But, 
in so many words, that’s exactly what many common opening-
statement formulas convey. The message you do want to impart 
is this: “You’re looking for a solution and I have it.” No matter the
situation, the product or service you sell, the size of the company
you approach, or whether you’re selling to individual consumers
or businesspeople, if you can zero in on the need and benefit of the
prospect and craft a compelling opening that addresses that need,

you’ve found a way to make that first impression a positive one.
And this chapter shows you how.
Living with the Seven-Second Rule
It’s a law of sales physics: From the beginning of the call, you have
seven seconds to give the customer a good reason to stay on the
line with you. Therefore, your opening statement must be great at
the very minimum. Outstanding, world class, or stellar is even
better.
Seven seconds isn’t a lot of time. But, unfortunately, it’s enough
time for the prospect to formulate a rejection response. If your
opening statement is less than great, you’re likely to hear, “I’m
busy”; “We already have one of those”; “I’m not interested”; “We
are happy with our current supplier”; or “I’ll get back to you if I
need it down the road.”
How do your prospects know they won’t be interested in your offer?
They don’t. But they do know that you weren’t interesting enough
for them to want to explore the possibility. They drew that conclu-
sion based on your less-than-great opening statement. To make the
first seven seconds something special, this section helps you get off
on the right foot.
Never assume
I don’t have to tell you what happens when you assume. But 
all too frequently, salespeople do just that. They assume that the
prospect is familiar with their company and what it offers. They
assume that the prospect remembers them, whether they’ve met
once or many times. However, studies on recognition indicate that
it takes more than six contacts before a prospect remembers and
recognizes a salesperson.
No matter how many times you or someone from your company 
has talked to a prospect, always clearly introduce yourself and your
company — even if you shook hands with the prospect last week or
talked on the phone yesterday. Sure, it takes up some of those pre-
cious seven seconds — but stopping in the middle of the opening
statement to remind the customer who you are and what your 
company does eats up a lot more time.
If you’re taking over someone else’s call lists, don’t assume that 
the prospect remembers the previous salesperson. If you open
with, “John Jones left, and I am taking over.” You will likely hear,
“John who? What company?” The better approach is to treat the 
Part III: You Make the Call! 
114

call as a cold call and allow the prospect warm-up time to connect
the dots. After you get past the opening, you can remind the
prospect that John used to be the company representative.
Make your voice music to their ears
In that first seven seconds, the prospect makes a judgment of your
intelligence, professionalism, and knowledge by the sound of your
voice and delivery of your message. He establishes a mental picture.
If you open those seven seconds with power and value, he visualizes
a capable, accomplished salesperson and treats you as such.
When you talk to another person, your words only account for 7 
percent of your ability to communicate, but the modulation of your
voice makes up 38 percent. Without the visual component — which
comprises 55 percent — you’re working at a distinct disadvantage
when you sell over the phone.
You can succeed in conjuring that professional image, compensating
for the lack of the visual component, by training yourself to maxi-
mize your modulation. Pay close attention to the following areas
when you practice and deliver your opening statement:
 Pace: A plodding dialogue does nothing to generate enthusi-
asm or interest. And if you’re as hyper as a Dalmatian, you risk
wearing the prospect out. Moderate a reasonable pace, but be
sure to incorporate variety. Slow down in places to emphasize 
a point, and vary the position and length of your pauses.
 Tonality: Avoid being monotone, at all costs. Practice moving
from a power delivery with a strong tone to a softer, patient
delivery. Varying your tone adds interest to your presentation
and helps highlight key points. Using tonality effectively helps
convey enthusiasm, believability, and passion.
Scripting an Opening Statement
In order to have a great opening, you can’t just wing it. You want
your opening to be great. In order to do so, you need to script it
and deliver it word for word. With the entire presentation resting
on those seven quick seconds, you can’t afford to wing it. This 
section helps you draft an effective opening.

an opening that can lead to a close, draft your statement on paper,
using these six parts as your outline.
Step one: Greet the prospect by name
The sweetest words in any language are those of one’s own name.
When you say the prospect’s name, she homes in on your voice as
quickly as a cat perks up its ears at the sound of the can opener.
Don’t undo all your good work by mispronouncing the name. Do
the recon necessary to verify the pronunciation ahead of time. If
the name is tough to pronounce, either call in advance to find out
how to pronounce it by listening to the prospect’s voice mail or
ask the receptionist to pronounce it. If you butcher it, you waste
valuable seconds being corrected — and alienate the prospect in
the process.
Step two: State your full name
Often in the frenzy and stress of hooking the prospect, salespeople
rush through their introduction with only a first name — especially
when they’ve met or spoken to the prospect previously. Make sure
you tell the prospect your full name. If you write out your full name
as part of your script, you remember to say it.
Step three: Identify your company
Just as with your full name (see the preceding section), don’t
assume that the prospect is familiar with your company or what it
does. Make sure you state your company’s service in a jargon-free,
easy-to-understand fashion. Don’t assume that the prospect knows
acronyms or complex terms. Initially state your service offering as 
if you were speaking to a novice.
You can also add what I call a specialty statement after giving the
name of the company. A specialty statement tells the prospect your
area of expertise or the area you’re known for. Set yourself apart
even more by incorporating a benefit into the specialty statement.
(This quick singular statement isn’t to be confused with the benefit
statements in step five where you deliver multiple statements.)
Check out the following examples:
 We specialize in reducing payroll costs.
 We specialize in rapid radiator repair.

 We specialize in selling high-end eastside real estate properties
at the best value.
Check out the section, “Building Your Elevator Speech” later in this
chapter to help you develop a quick, but thorough, speech about
your company in case the prospect wants more background info.
Step four: Explain why you’re calling
It’s time to get to the point. You’re now going to reveal why the
prospect is taking her time to talk with you. The easiest way to get
to the point is . . . to get to the point! “The reason for my call is . . .”
should be put right in your script.
Keep your focus on the prospect. On one hand, the reason for 
your call is to make your sales quota by the end of the week. But
that is irrelevant to your prospect. Cast your “reason” in a way that
is meaningful to her. For example, “The reason for my call is our
new cable package offers 30 percent more channel selection that
what you’re currently getting.”
Step five: Link in a benefit statement
The benefit statement is added to your reason-I’m-calling statement.
You’re now approaching the seven-second cut-off: If the benefit
statement isn’t tuned to WIIFM, you lose the listener. WIIFM is the
Chapter 9: Opening Your Sales Call with Ease 117
The power of specialization
One of the best words you can use in describing your company or yourself is 
specialist. It positions you as an expert. People want to work with the best, and 
specialist implies that you’re more experienced in this particular field than others.
Ultimately, it shows that the prospect has a low risk when choosing to work with you.
When you define yourself as a specialist, this also tends to focus your efforts as 
a salesperson. Instead of being all things to all people, your potential for sales 
success actually increases when you narrow your area of expertise. Be sure to sell
those strengths in the specialty statement of your opening (see the section “Step
three: Identify your company” for more info). What does your company do better
than anyone else? What are the core competencies, core focus, or core compo-
nents that set your business apart?
When you’re positioning yourself or your company as a specialist in an area, it 
doesn’t mean you can’t offer other products or services outside your defined expert-
ise. You can always recommend an alternative if the prospect doesn’t want your 
specialized offer. But when you sell your best first, you increase the odds of 
opening up a strong and long-lasting relationship.

radio station that plays in our brains 24/7. It stands for What’s In 
It For Me? If your benefit statement doesn’t address that listening
audience, you run a good chance of turning off your prospect.
The less contact you’ve had with the prospect, the more critical the
benefit statement. But even if you’re making a follow-up call with an
established client, playing WIIFM is always music to a prospect’s
ears. Here are some examples of effective benefit statements:
 “We’ve had considerable success in reducing payroll costs 
in mid-sized companies like yours.”
 “We’ve achieved significant performance increases for our
clients through our scheduling software that they now use.”
 “We’ve seen our clients reduce their weight by more than 
15 percent, on average, in just three weeks.”
Step six: Add a close or bridge
. . . Five, four, three, two. . . . The time has come to wrap up the 
opening statement as you close in on the seven-second marker. But
you don’t want the road to end here, so you make your conclusion 
a question or a bridge so that continuing the conversation is natural
and easy.
If you choose to close with a question, use it to establish some
form of commitment. Ask for an appointment, for example:
 “Let’s set an appointment to talk. Which would work better 
for you — Wednesday or Thursday?”
 “Our next step would be to meet. Do you have time this week,
or would next week be better?”
The bridge is a softer approach, linking the benefit statement 
with the close by asking permission to explore further. Although the
question close infers more certainty, the bridge places some power
into the prospect’s hands, which often makes her more comfortable
to proceed:
“Until we invest a few minutes together, I don’t know if your results
will be the same, worse, or better than those of XYZ Company.
Would you be willing to spend a few minutes together to see?”
“Bob, I am not sure at this juncture if I can help you, and you are
not sure if I can’t, so let’s spend a few minutes together to find out
if you could benefit from our product.”

118

Engaging the prospect
When you’re establishing communication without the benefit of 
a visual or physical connection, any technique that can help you
reach through the phone and connect with the prospect is bound to
smooth the way. Add one of these to your opening for extra impact:
 Drop names when appropriate. Name-dropping takes a bad
rap, but it’s a tactic that works in the business world. If you
can mention a respected friend or colleague or even a promi-
nent person in the industry, you earn the prospect’s attention
and reduce resistance. For example:
• “During a conversation with Fred Smith at FedEx 
last week . . .”
• “Just the other day while visiting Microsoft’s 
headquarters . . .”
Mentioning a competitor of the prospect’s company can 
also work as a doorstop, but you must do it carefully. Referring
to a leader in the industry — a company that surpasses the
prospect in sales, stature, longevity, and brand recognition — 
is best. The prospect perks up at the possibility of discovering
the secrets that the competitor is so successfully using.
 Use manners. The words “thank you” are magic. I know when
I pick up the phone and hear, “Dirk Zeller, I want to thank you
for . . .” I tune in for more!
A perfect opportunity to say thank you is when the individual
is already a customer or has purchased in the past. You may
be following up with someone who bought over the Internet
or through former sales agents. Instead of the typical, “I see
you bought _____ from us, and I would like to sell you some-
thing else,” launch it with a thank-you: “I’d like to thank you
for your recent order. I see we had the opportunity to provide
you with toner and copier paper.”
Putting it all together
More than a few salespeople are intimidated by the task of crafting
an opening statement. Coming up with an introduction that captures
the prospect’s interest can seem daunting. And, indeed, your seven-
second speech may take hours of wordsmithing — and many more
in practice, fine tuning, and evaluating. I’m here to help. In this 
section, I put together a fill-in-the-blank statement for you. Use 
it as a framework for your own customized openers.
Chapter 9: Opening Your Sales Call with Ease 119

I even provide a list of word suggestions (see Table 9-1 for some
examples) so you can plug in the best description for your particu-
lar needs. Use these words or explore through your thesaurus to
find your own. I suggest you continually work to expand the chart 
to include as many as 20 or 30 words in each category. Then you’ll
always have the right words at your fingertips.

Use the following outline and word list from Table 9-1 verbatim 
to jazz up your existing statements or to prime your mental pump
when creating your own. Break down the fill-in-the-blank statement
into its parts:
1. “Hello, [name of prospect], I’m [your full name] with [your
company’s name].”
Easy enough. Just remember to verify the correct pronunci-
ation of the prospect’s name before you call.
2. “The reason for my call today is, depending on your experi-
ence in [specialty area], there is a probability we can aid you,
like we have [name drop], with [shrinking verb] your [nega-
tive result noun] while also [expanding verb] your [positive
result noun].
Part III: You Make the Call! 
120

In the bracketed specialty area, briefly describe what 
you and your company offer customers. In the name drop
brackets, plug in a name familiar to the client — whether 
an admired industry professional you both know or a 
prestigious client that the prospect may relate to.
Now, you get into the mini grammar lesson! In brackets,
you see the phrases shrinking verb, negative-result noun,
and expanding verb. Basically, this sentence highlights the
benefit that you can provide, by showing how you can turn
an undesirable situation into a positive one for the company.
Thus, the bad verb and noun versus the good verb and noun.
My list in Table 9-1 gives you some common words you can
choose. You should come up with something like, “. . . we
can aid you in reducing your expenses while also maximizing
your productivity.”
3. “If you have a moment, I’d like to [call-to-action phrase] your
situation to see if this is something [closing phrase].”
Finally, you’re ready for the wrap-up, incorporating a call-to-
action phrase with a closing phrase. For example, “. . . I’d like
to discuss your situation to see if this is something that would
be of value to you.”
By using this script, you have now constructed an effective opening
statement.
Delivering a Knock-Down-
the-Door Opener
Writing your opening statement (see preceding section) is only half
the task; delivering it effectively is just as important. The way that
you write is entirely different from the way that you speak. So what
looked great on paper now has to be brought to life to be sure it also
sounds great. You want to sound confident, professional, knowledge-
able, and helpful — in essence, be the expert. This section shows
you how to rehearse your opening, how to determine whether it’s
effective, and how to make adjustments to it.
Rehearsing for the real thing
Before you pick up the phone and try your opening, you want 
to practice. Investing the time to rehearse and practice your state-
ments put the words to the test. Does your introduction sound natu-
ral? Persuasive? Is your opener attention getting? Intriguing? Is your
description of your company’s focus clear? Do your words present a
compelling case to explore further? You know only if you test them.
Chapter 9: Opening Your Sales Call with Ease 121

In order to rehearse your opening statement, follow these steps to
ensure your opening doesn’t fall flat:
1. Find a coworker, friend, or partner to role-play with you.
Go through your script a few times and then ask for 
feedback.
2. Take the suggestions and adjust accordingly, and then
test again.
In this go-round, focus on the words rather than your deliv-
ery. Check out Table 9-1 or a thesaurus to adjust your script.
3. After you tweak the opening based on the feedback you
receive, practice the delivery alone.
When doing so, vary the tone and pace of your voice to 
so you’re more interesting to listen to. Recalibrate the
emphasis points and downswings as necessary.
4. After you feel comfortable with the opening, role-play
with another salesperson or your sales manager and ask
for more feedback.
Try delivering the script with a few variations: maybe slow
the pace in one delivery or emphasize different phrases in
another. Ask which version sounded best.
5. Apply the feedback you receive and record and listen 
to your opening.
This step separates the top salespeople from all the others.
Hearing yourself allows you the closest thing to objectivity
you can get in evaluating your delivery. And listening to your
recorded self is actually closer to the way your prospects
hear you on the phone. It shows you how you really come
across. The recording device demonstrates, unfiltered, how
your prospect hears you.
When listening to yourself for the first time, don’t do it at the
office! Take the recording home and, before you turn on the
tape, pour yourself a glass of wine. You’re going to need it —
you probably won’t like what you hear!
6. Then make the necessary changes and test again.
Adjust the emphasis points, play with the tone, change the
words you’re using, or just spend some more time practicing
if your delivery needs work.
Your opening is a work in progress. Professional golfers are 
always tinkering with their swings in hopes of improving their
scores. Likewise, a salesperson can benefit from tinkering with 
the opening statement. And sometimes you may stumble upon 
Part III: You Make the Call! 
122

an unconventional twist that increases the effectiveness of your
openers.
You not only want to rehearse your opening before you start 
making calls, but you also want to revisit it again and again during
your sales career to fine-tune your opening. Perfecting your opening
statement requires patience and commitment to ongoing improve-
ment. When I’m asked how long it takes to become an outstanding
salesperson, I reply, “Forty-five years, and I’m still working on it.”
Focus on getting better with each day.
Measuring your effectiveness
Because the purpose of an opening statement is to open the door
with the prospect, you can consider your opener a success if it
gets you to the presentation level. You can measure the success
rate, then, of your opener with the contact-to-appointment ratio,
which means measuring how many contacts you made (in which
you reached and spoke to a live person) against the number of
appointments you scheduled.
A high close ratio, say 7 appointments out of 10 contacts, means
your opening statement must be pretty convincing. A more dis-
parate ratio — 1 out of 10 — indicates your opener may need some
fine tuning (for tips on how to do this, see the preceding section).
Don’t make the mistake of using your sales numbers as a gauge; too
many variables come between the opening statement and the close
to rely on that factor. Stick with the contact-to-appointment ratio.
The objective of your opening statement isn’t beautiful prose, 
but results. If you ever watched golf champ Lee Trevino swing, you
would swear the big banana arc of his golf shot would never work. It
worked well enough, however, to win him six major championships
in golf. The same is true for your opening statement. If it’s not pretty,
but it’s effective . . . who cares!
Dodging Kiss-of-Death Openings
Before you even begin the sales process, a kiss-of-death opening
statement can bury your chances in less than seven seconds. Why?
Kiss-of-death starts create resistance and shut down receptiveness.
They result in high levels of, “I’m busy now,” “Not interested,” and
“Don’t call me; I’ll call you.” You want to avoid such starts like the
plague. But what does a kiss-of-death beginning look like? Here are 
a few examples to avoid at all costs.
Chapter 9: Opening Your Sales Call with Ease 123

Inviting “no” responses
If you give the prospect an opportunity to say “no” in the first few
seconds, you find your opening statement aborted and your sales
call derailed. Consider carefully any content that allows for a
response. For example:
“My name is Bob. I sell widgets. May I take a few minutes of your
time to talk with you about them?”
This statement practically says “no” for the prospect. When you ask
anything remotely close to “Do you have time to talk?”, expect to
hear a hang-up click in response. To make matters worse, this state-
ment is me-centered: “My name is . . .”; “I sell . . .”; and “May I. . . . ”
Here’s another deadly lead related to inviting “no” responses:
“I sent you a brochure about XYZ Brand widgets and was 
wondering if you got it.”
Sure, he got it . . . and he’s already thrown it away and forgotten
about it. This scenario is lose-lose: If you don’t hear a “no,” then
you get something along the lines of, “I may have seen it, but had 
no interest in it.” That forces you to divert your efforts into over-
coming an objection. Giving the prospect this power is another 
kiss-of-death move that would need a jaws-of-life solution to save it.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
124
Ask for just what you need
I coached a financial-planning client who was consistently getting shut down during
his opening statement. Immediately after identifying himself, the cold-call prospect
would reply, “Not interested,” or something along the lines of “Fred Jones at XYZ
Company handles our money.”
I asked him how long he thought he really needed on the initial call to pique 
the prospect’s interest and have a shot at booking an appointment. “A couple of
minutes,” he said. Well, you can imagine that it took us some time to agree on a
length that we both felt may work. With effort, we got it down to 37 seconds.
And that’s exactly what my client asks for from his prospects: 37 seconds of their
time! The results have been amazing. He has doubled the number of presentations
he’s making. Is the 37 seconds unorthodox? A gimmick? Sure —but it works.

Putting on the sleaze
I’ve done my best not to bring up the image of the sultan-of-
sleaze salesman. This mostly undeserved stereotype emerged in 
the 1970s when verbal judo techniques were practiced by a few.
You can just picture him, can’t you? Leisure suit, gold chain, open
collar, and pinky ring. But even more insidious are the tactics this
image evokes: a fast-talking, strong-arming, sign-at-whatever-cost
image that has resulted in more damage to the salesperson’s 
reputation than The Godfather movies have for Sicilians.
When you’re speaking to a contact for the first time, the last thing
you want to do is to conjure up this scary image. (Remember, no
second chances to make a first impression.) But certain wording
can make you come across as the sleazy salesperson. For example,
“If I could show you a way to reduce your inventory costs, you
would want to hear more, wouldn’t you?”
Tie-down endings such as “. . . wouldn’t you agree?” attempt to
entrap the prospect into saying yes. The underlying message is,
“You’d have to be an idiot to disagree.” It may have worked back 
in the ’70s, but businesspeople have had a few decades to recog-
nize the signs of sales sleaze. If you’re lucky enough not to get an
immediate hang-up, you spend the rest of the sales process trying
to win back trust.
Avoiding “And how are you today?”
First cousin to the sleaze lead, this opening, “And how are you
today?” just screams to the world that you are a salesperson — 
and not even a good one. Many salespeople open with this question
because they believe it helps build rapport. But these days, “How
are you today?” has even less relevance and resonance than the 
Star Trek Vulcan salute.
We have a money jar in our Sales Champions sales department.
When anyone hears another salesperson executing a poor opening
statement, a dollar goes into the jar. But if someone uses “And how
are you today?” it’s $10. That’s how much I hate this opening.
Let me share with you a few reasons why you don’t want to use
this opening statement:
 It’s not genuine. Be honest with yourself. You really don’t care
how they are — and they know it. To really engage the client 
at that level, your heart and brain need to be connected and
caring. And that’s too much to do in the first seven seconds 
of your relationship.
Chapter 9: Opening Your Sales Call with Ease 125

 It’s devoid of creativity. This opener is so lacking originality
that you not only won’t grab the attention of your prospect,
but you’ll also dull her mind and push it to auto-pilot. You’re
getting awfully close to the “no” switch.
 You open yourself up to a cold-water response. This type 
of response from the prospect is one from which you can’t 
possibly come back. For example:
• “My department didn’t meet quota for the third quarter 
in a row, and I could get fired.”
• “My wife just served me with divorce papers.”
• “I have a terrible headache.”
Oh, sure, you can find dozens of ways you can reply. But none
can get you back on the sales track.
If you’re calling a current customer or someone you know fairly well,
“how are you?” may be appropriate. But be prepared to listen — and
hold off your sales opening for another call.
Building Your Elevator Speech
Can you effectively convey what you and your company do beyond
your job title and list of services? A powerful, clear, and succinct
explanation has great value to you as a salesperson. Having such a
description prepared and at hand provides a ready summary from
which you can pull. Among its many merits, your elevator speech
serves as the foundation for your opening statement.
The term 30-second elevator speech is age-old jargon in the sales
profession that describes your explanation of what you or your
company does. The statement should be brief enough to deliver 
in the time it takes to ride an elevator — about 30 seconds, or 
100 to 150 words. In today’s marketplace, however, I don’t believe
you’re granted even 30 seconds — it’s quickly shrinking from ele-
vator ride to revolving-door entry! This section points out some
helpful tips to assist you in drafting your elevator speech.
Accentuate the positive
Part of building a good elevator statement is cogently conveying
what your company does. However, what you sell isn’t enough.
Often, the prospect doesn’t know anything about your company,
doesn’t want to know, has never bought anything from your com-
pany in the past, and doesn’t expect to buy anything in the future.
You can reverse this by conveying your business in terms of bene-
fits to the prospect. For example:
Part III: You Make the Call! 
126

“I’m Bob Smith with ACME Adhesives. We are an all-in-one 
adhesives group that specializes in the plumbing industry.”
At Sales Champions, one of our primary services is coaching. 
Trust me; no one wakes up in the morning wanting to buy coaching.
However, they do want the benefits we provide through coaching:
more time off, higher sales, increased income, growing repeat and
referral business, and more prestige because they’re the leading
salespeople at their firm. This is what we sell — not coaching. 
What are you providing and selling?
Going beyond your job title
No matter your job title (whether it’s salesperson, account execu-
tive, vice president of sales, or certified financial planner), this label
doesn’t describe who you are or what you do. You want your eleva-
tor speech to be crystal clear in what you do. Describing what you
do for your clients, rather than giving your title, allows you to
clearly communicate the benefits that you have to offer. Relying 
on your job title to parlay that information could, in some cases,
mislead the prospect or be totally meaningless.
For example, say your job title is sales consultant and your responsi-
bility is to acquire and serve new accounts. In your prospect’s work
environment, the sales consultant title is carried by administrative 
or support staff, individuals who possibly even report to your
prospect. That title doesn’t mean anything to your client.
But if you give the client some concrete info about what you do and
how it can benefit her, then she can appreciate much better what
you have to offer. Take a look at a couple examples:
 Instead of copier salesperson: “I’m a document specialist who
creates efficiencies and cost savings for companies through
proper utilization of office equipment.
 Instead of long-distance salesperson: “I’m a communication
specialist who increases and enhances performance of 
companies through advanced communication technology.”
Setting yourself apart
You can also use your elevator speech to stand out from the com-
petition. In addition to focusing on what you do rather than who
you are, here are some other tips for making a lasting and positive
impression:
Chapter 9: Opening Your Sales Call with Ease 127

 Review corporate materials. Study all of your company’s
materials, including consumer brochures and single-product
promotions, annual reports, media kits, marketing pieces,
press releases, the corporate Web site, news articles about
the company, outlines, corporate sales memos, and annual
reports. Then, from what you’ve absorbed, answer these
questions:
• What is our area of specialization?
• What are the top-ten claims or areas of emphasis?
• Which of these pieces clearly describes what we do?
 Put on customer-colored glasses. When you can see your
business through the eyes of your customers, you’re better
poised to position the salient information that matters most
to them. What must the prospect hear to understand what
you do and the benefits she will receive?
 Tackle the problem in a sales meeting. Gather the input of
other sales colleagues in the company. An effective exercise 
is to call a meeting and ask each person present to craft an
answer to your “What does the company do?” question. Give
them a short time limit — less than two minutes is preferable.
You want their honest gut reaction to that question. Then
review the statements together.
I find it best to write them for all to see on a board. Don’t 
be surprised if the responses are all over the map. You may
wonder whether you all even work for the same company!
Work together to select the best answers, and combine related
descriptions to whittle down the list. After some culling and
editing, you may come up with one or two that everyone likes.
Then role-play the statements to further test the elevator
speeches. Ask yourself:
• Does it sound right?
• Is it compelling enough?
• Does it accurately describe what we do?
• Is it too long?
Take the time to edit it, practice it, and play with it until the
delivery is comfortable.
 Get feedback from a trusted client. After you polish and prac-
tice your elevator speech, consider calling your best clients
and testing it. Ask them the same questions you asked of your-
self and request their honest feedback — no soft-pedaling!

S
ilver-tongued. Fast-talking. Able to sell snow to an Eskimo.
Expressions such as these are often used to describe salespeo-
ple. The traditional image portrays salespeople as using the gift of
gab, the ability to talk people into buying anything.
In reality, sales doesn’t work this way. Like the proverbial horse 
to water, you can lead a prospect through a sales presentation, 
but you can’t make him buy. As a sales professional, you don’t 
talk a customer into buying, but, instead, question the prospect
into recognizing that you have the answer to his needs.
Oh, sure, you still run through your sales presentation. But before
you offer your solutions, you lead the prospect to the obvious con-
clusions through your deftly crafted and choreographed question-
ing process. Oftentimes, not meeting your sales goals is a sign that
your questioning skills may need a tune-up. This section can help
you draft the right types of questions to turn around your sales.

Understanding the Importance 
of Asking Questions
A top salesperson helps match a tailored solution to a prospect’s
specific need. In order to pinpoint that need and customize your
sales presentation, you must have information: the who, what,
when, where, how, and why of the need; the decision-making
process; previous experience with other providers; and how this
prospect is differentiated from others. And asking questions is 
the route to knowledge.
The more questions you ask, the more information you gather.
And, just as in any field or profession, the more information you
have, the more effective you are in your job. When you’re talking
or telling, you only reconfirm what you already know. When you’re
asking, you open up yourself to discovering something new. This
section explains why asking the right questions is vital to you
having a good call or a hang-up.
Building trust through questions
At the early stages of your dialogue with a prospect, in order to get
off on the right foot, you want to build trust with the prospect and 
to lay the foundations of a mutually beneficial business relationship.
Just as you develop positive personal connections, you know that
you make a better impression when you focus on the other person
rather than talking about yourself.

The sister company to Sales Champions — Real Estate Champions — provides edu-
cation, coaching, and training to real estate professionals. In the rare instances that
sales calls make it past the gatekeeper to my office, I find that at least 40 percent
of the salespeople launch right into their “pitch” without asking a single question.
Within one minute, the fact that they don’t know anything about Real Estate
Champions is clear.
I usually stop the caller in midsentence and ask, “What do you think my company,
Real Estate Champions, does?” I hear some vague, garbled, uncertain response
about real estate sales. I politely say “Thank you” and hang up. I don’t want to buy
from someone who demonstrates a total lack of interest in my business’s true needs.
It’s clear to me that this sort of individual cares only about making a sale.

By asking questions, you create an interesting dynamic. Even though
you’re controlling the conversation, you shift the spotlight on the
prospect. And even though the prospect is revealing more than you
are, your potential customer leaves the interaction with a clearer
perception of you. “Boy, that salesperson was sure insightful and
service oriented. I can tell that company will give my business the
attention I want.”
Asking permission to ask
Before you jump into a deluge of questions though, you want 
to ask the prospect if you can ask her some questions. Believe it 
or not, asking permission to ask questions is effective and shows 
the prospect that you respect her and her time. By allowing the
prospect the choice of answering your questions, you frame 
the opening dialogue and launch it on a positive path.
Chapter 10: Getting Out of the Answers and Into the Questions 131
Creating the E. F. Hutton effect
Television viewers of the 1970s and ’80s may recall a series of commercials featur-
ing the stock brokerage firm of E. F. Hutton. In each spot, a buzzing crowd halted all
conversation as people strained to listen in on an investment discussion. “When 
E. F. Hutton talks, people listen,” is how each commercial concluded.
Making a declaration that’s powerful enough to stop the conversation — or at least
intrigue the listener to hear more — is the intent of this approach: Instead of asking
permission to question the prospect — you announce the importance of what you
are about to do. For example:
 “Bob, I have some very important questions to ask you. Do you have a few 
minutes?”
 “Bob, there are some critical issues I’d like to ask you about. Is now a good
time?”
The words very important and critical catch the prospect’s attention and generate
curiosity, resulting in the lean-in, high-alert response that you want.
Use this approach with care, however. From this setup, the questions you launch
had better be meaningful to the prospect, or the call could be over in less than a
minute. If you ask questions about the prospect’s current supplier of products or
services that you’re trying to sell, you have asked a bad question. You just asked a
you-centered question rather than a them-centered question. The focus of the call
is not about you at this juncture; it’s about the prospect.

Here are some ways to ask permission that I have found to be
effective:
“Bob, would it be okay if I ask you a few questions about 
your business?”
“Bob, would it be alright to spend a few moments asking you
questions about your company?”
“Bob, could we review some questions I’ve prepared, so I under-
stand your department needs?”
By showing this courtesy, you’re also more likely to gain the
prospect’s agreement to reschedule the conversation if this time
isn’t convenient.
Give the prospect a clear idea of how much time you need for ques-
tions, keeping it to ten minutes or less. If you reach the ten-minute
mark and you’re not done, you may ask for a few more minutes — 
or suggest scheduling another appointment with more time to talk.
Don’t continue without permission; the prospect may feel that you
pulled a bait-and-switch.
Qualifying through Questions
Having spent more than 20 years of my life in 100-percent commis-
sion sales with no salary base, company car, expense account, 
and so forth, I’m fanatical about knowing the opportunity cost of 
a prospect. When you get paid only for results, you do everything
you can to zero in on prospects most likely to offer a high return on
your investment of time and energy.
Qualifying is one of the most important sales stages during which
to use questions. When you qualify, you’re determining the needs,
wants, and desires of your prospects. Certainly, to make a sale, you
need to know those factors. During qualifying, however, you also
assess and evaluate the probability of making the sale and deter-
mine the size of the sale. Great salespeople are extremely effective
qualifiers of prospects.
Gathering information about the client’s unique needs, gauging 
the urgency of the need, getting a sense of his decision-making
power — these are all benefits of the qualifying phase of your 
call. This section gives the lowdown on each aspect of qualifying.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
132

Getting the prospect to open up
As you prepare your questions, you want to pose queries that 
provide you information and allow the prospect to share his needs
and desires. When asking questions, you basically have two types
of questions to ask:
 Open-ended questions: These types of questions generate
details, information, facts, experiences, and opinions — these
are the questions that bring you the knowledge you need to
effectively qualify a prospect. Make sure you use numerous
open-ended questions during your call.
A couple examples of open-ended questions include
• What are the most significant challenges you are 
experiencing in your division or business right now?
• If a widget company like ours could provide additional
service and value to you, what would that look like 
for you?
Prepare a list of open-ended questions that connect with the
product or service you’re selling. Be sure to plan open-ended
questions in advance. You don’t want to “wing it” with open-
ended questions. (Check out the next section for more on
asking open-ended questions.)
 Closed-ended questions: These types of questions elicit 
a simple yes, no, or maybe answer. Closed-ended questions
have their place in the sales presentation. However, you want
to use them sparingly. Some examples include
• Do you see yourself using our service?
• Have I demonstrated our value well enough for you 
to consider purchasing?
You can use closed-ended questions in trial closes that test where
you are in the sales process. You can also use them to confirm infor-
mation that has been shared to make sure that you understand the
prospect’s needs and desires. They are also used effectively in final
close statements before you take the order.
Not just the facts, ma’am
When you ask your open-ended questions, you’re not only looking
for facts. You also want a fuller, more-dimensional rap sheet on the
individual: Emotions, feelings, values, and ideals as they relate to the
business at hand and problems that need solutions are all critical 
Chapter 10: Getting Out of the Answers and Into the Questions 133

in order to know the prospect’s modus operandi. And open-ended
questions that elicit these particulars are of the utmost importance.
Why and how questions garner much of this information. At a 
minimum, your questions should identify why the prospect is con-
sidering action or change and how they measure, gauge, consider, 
or evaluate proposals or a long-term relationship. Consider asking
the following questions:
“Why are you considering a change?”
“Why do you feel you have a problem in this area?”
“Why have you done business with these companies in the past?”
“Why is the timing right now?”
“Why are you considering this company?”
“How will you make the decision?”
“How did you typically make decisions of this magnitude in 
the past?”
“How will you evaluate the proposals?”
“How will you weigh the priorities you have outlined for me?”
“How would you gauge a long-term, successful relationship with 
a service provider like me?”
You ask these types of questions to determine timeframe, decision
process, and the odds of you having a reasonable chance at earning
their business. If you can’t get favorable responses that offer you a
reasonable chance to win new business, you may be forced to find
another prospect and move on.
Checking Your Prospect’s DNA2
Knowing the prospect’s DNA2 (desire, need, ability, and authority) 
is paramount to your sales success. If one or more of these four
factors are out of line, you may not make the sale or — at the very
least — you’ll find the process lengthier than you’d like.
The only way to find out the DNA2 is to ask questions. In this section
I look at a prospect’s desire, need, ability, and authority to place the
order with you.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
134

Uncovering that object of desire
Desire relates to the prospect’s motivation to do something — the
greater the desire, the more motivated the buyer is to take action. 
A high level of desire often means a shorter decision-making period
and less concern about price. Clearly, a prospect with desire is 
a great prospect for you.
You want to add questions to your plan that help you determine
the prospect’s desires. The best sign for strong desire is that the
prospect has a plan. She knows her requirements for service and
time to make a decision and has quantifiable expectations that you
can uncover as you ask the right questions. Your questions should
be timeline focused. You want to know how quickly she will make
the decision and if the decision is imminent.
Some example questions include
“How long have you been considering changing suppliers?”
“What is your timeline to make the change?”
“If we could provide you with what you’re looking for, 
what would the next steps be?”
Don’t mistake interest level for desire. Often, an individual who
eagerly engages in the sales process may be at the exploratory
phase — gathering information just as you are. This type of prospect
may give himself away by expressing unrealistic expectations. For
example, an “interested” real estate prospect may suggest selling 
his home for $50,000 more than it’s worth and buying a home for
$50,000 below market value. In truth, this person — though inter-
ested in the real estate climate — doesn’t have a high desire to get
out of his home and into a new one. He’s simply testing the waters.
Working on a need-to-know basis
The quantifiable void between where the prospect is now and 
where she wants to be defines the prospect’s need for your product
or service. Your job is to get a precise measure of this void — the
more exact your figures are, the easier you can successfully respond
to the need. And, of course, the bigger the need, the more certain the
sale. Some example questions include
“How large a problem is what we are discussing today?”
“What do you feel is the cost of this problem in lost revenue 
to your company?”
Chapter 10: Getting Out of the Answers and Into the Questions 135

“If you could design the ideal solution, what would it look like?”
After you identify the need, the next step is to gauge its size and 
significance. “How painful is this problem?” and “What are the
costs?” are focuses for good questions. The bigger the problem and
the bigger the costs of the problem, the larger the desire. Ask what
it’s costing your prospect in revenue, efficiency, labor, waste, cus-
tomer service, and repeat business. Also ask “Is the potential sale 
an already budgeted item?” and “When is the proposed implementa-
tion scheduled if you do go forward with a purchase?” Asking can
help you determine if she is merely information gathering or really
going to take action.
When you devise questions, you want to get the specifications 
in terms of numbers: hours saved, production increased, dollars
reduced, and amount of new revenue created. Instead of accepting
vague answers like “It would be worth a lot” or “I could save a 
fortune,” probe for specifics. Some examples include
 How many dollars?
 How much time?
 How big an increase in revenue?
With these answers, you can demonstrate how your service can 
satisfy the prospect’s need. For example, you discover that the
prospect has a budget that is $1,000 below what your office copier
costs. You also find out that the company makes an average of
50,000 copies a year. Because your machine would reduce print
costs by one cent per copy, you can show how, over the course of
just two years, the machine would pay for the additional hit on the
budget.
Assessing financial ability
The prospect may have the desire and need for your product, but
financial ability is essential for you to make a sale. That’s why it’s
important to ask about money at the question stage, in order to
determine whether budget is a barrier. Some examples include the
following:
“Is this type of purchase in the budget?”
“Will you be using working capital, or do we need to establish 
a payment plan for a purchase like this?”
“Do you usually lease or purchase these types of investments?”
Part III: You Make the Call! 
136

Just because you receive a negative response to any of these 
questions doesn’t mean the discussion is over. Further questions
can help you determine when and how the circumstances might
change — you may even be able to come upon some creative pay-
ment possibilities. Questions such as these help you to make those
determinations:
“Is there another budget area you could use to make the 
purchase?”
“Is there enough value in the purchase to override the budget?”
“Could we explore some financing solutions?”
“When does the next budget cycle commence?”
Financial limitations are the most common objection used to derail 
a sale. A skillful salesperson can use questions to help recognize
when budget is played to evade and when it is a legitimate reason
for not moving ahead. Check out Chapter 13 for more info.
Measuring authority level
The final element of DNA2, decision-making authority, is essential 
to bind the other components into a formula that ensures sales
success. Desire, need, and ability can all be in place, but they don’t
matter a whit if you’re talking to a person who can’t say “Yes.”
Don’t assume that just because the company representative is 
willing to talk to you, he’s in a position to make a decision. Lots of
employees like to project a “big-cheese” image, when, in fact, they
have little authority.
Questions such as these can ferret out the faux decision makers:
“Are you the sole decision maker with regard to this purchase?”
“Is there anyone else who will have influence over this 
investment?”
“Is there anyone else involved that I should send the 
information to?”
“Is there anyone else who should attend the sales 
presentation?”
Nothing is more frustrating and ineffective than to get through your
presentation and have someone say, “Well, I’ll pass this information
on to my boss. He’s the person who will make the final decision.”
Chapter 10: Getting Out of the Answers and Into the Questions 137

Now, you’re relying on how well this intermediary can make your
presentation for you. I guarantee that it won’t be done as well as 
you would do it.
Past the Qualifying Round: 
Asking More Questions
So your questioning tactics worked to qualify the prospect and
determine her desire, need, ability, and authority. Are you ready to
move on from the questions and into the answers? Not necessarily.
Questions are also a great tool to position yourself to build your
case before you go into your presentation. This section helps you
address questions after you’ve qualified your prospects.
Circling the problems
The questioning process is guaranteed to raise what salespeople
euphemistically like to call challenges. You may also know them as
objections, roadblocks, or problems. Whatever you call these hin-
drances, uncovering them is imperative, so don’t shy away from
asking the questions that bring them up.
And then, after you uncover these problems, be prepared to ask
more questions. Before you fly in like Superman with a solution,
keep asking questions until you can see the problem from all sides.
Don’t leave it to chance that your first reading is complete. The
solution may be 180 degrees different than either you or your
prospect first imagined. Ask questions like:
“What sort of solutions have you tried in the past to resolve 
this problem?”
“Why do you think these efforts didn’t solve the problem?”
“What do you see as the most logical solution?”
“Have you ever tried _______________?”
“In your unique situation, do you think _______________ 
or _______________ would work best?”
“If you found the perfect solution, what would it look like to you?”
“How does your boss see the problem?”
Part III: You Make the Call! 
138

By deftly asking these questions, you can effectively come to a
solution that pleases the prospect and puts you in prime position 
to be the hero. After you’re there, you can tie the sale up with
questions like:
“Do you see this as the most logical solution?”
“Is there another answer that neither of us has thought 
about yet?”
“Have the other people or companies come up with similar 
recommendations as I have for this problem?”
“If they differ, how do we differ from them?”
You’re ready to close if you get favorable responses to these 
questions. Turn to Chapter 14 for more.
Checking for intention
The questioning process typically gives the salesperson a fairly
accurate read on the prospect’s intentions to buy. But asking out-
right isn’t only admissible, but also wise. At this point, you don’t
have to be as direct as “Can I have your business?” Instead, you
can take the prospect’s temperature with questions like:
“Do you see yourself using a service like mine?”
“Could you see yourself doing business with my firm in the 
near future?”
Remember to anticipate responses and be prepared for any 
answer so that you can follow up appropriately. In the case of a 
yes answer, you can ask questions like the following to keep the
ball rolling in a positive, productive direction:
“Under what circumstances would you see that happening?”
“What are the steps we need to take to make that happen?”
“If I draft a proposal, would you be willing to review it?”
The follow-up question to a no response is straightforward: 
“Why?” Or, to be more specific, “Why do you feel there aren’t any
circumstances that would enable us to work together?” You can
often guide the prospect to the sale without knowing why you’re
being stopped, slowed down, or detoured, but the word why is one
of the most powerful tools a salesperson has to use. By asking why,
you’re prompting the prospect to explain his logic, decision, or
action, getting you to the root of the problem, challenge, or barrier.

How to Get Better Results: 
Five Strategies
The questioning phase is critical to the sales process. But it’s not
all that difficult when you follow five basic strategies to help you
form questions. These aren’t “steps” that must be taken in a cer-
tain sequence; rather, they’re helpful avenues that can improve
your results and help you get to the next phase of the process
more successfully.
Know your goal
You’ve heard it before: If you don’t know where you’re going, any
path will take you there. And if you don’t set your sights on the
purpose of your call, your questions are untargeted and likely to
generate useless information.
Determine, before punching in that phone number, what you want 
to accomplish with this particular call. Are you trying to generate 
a lead? Get a referral? Create an appointment? Convey information?
Make a sale? Know where you want to go so you can ask the 
questions that will take you there.

The power of why
One winter when my family vacationed in Palm Desert, California, my 5-year-old
son, Wesley, woke up one morning and decided he was going to open a lemonade
stand. We were staying on a golf course, and he saw a ready market for his prod-
uct among the golfers coming off the green behind our condo.
Wesley and I went to the store and bought lemonade, cookies, and paper cups, as
well as construction paper and felt pens to make a sign. Later that day, Wesley’s
lemonade stand opened. When he spied the first group of players to come our way,
I could barely contain him from approaching them before they finished putting. I
held my breath as he launched into his sales presentation. Then I heard one of the
“prospects” say no. I prayed in my head, “Please don’t let him get discouraged.”
But before I could complete the thought, I heard him ask, “Why? It’s really good
lemonade; it’s refreshing, and I made it myself.” These guys were no match for my
5-year-old. They were the first of many people to buy from him that day. He made
more than $22 in lemonade sales before he ran out. You can learn a lot about sales
from a child who isn’t afraid to ask the big sales question: “Why?”

For example, say you’re calling a lead to discover how the company
goes about making a purchase decision. You can then dispense with
queries that you’d ask to close the sale and tailor your question to
reveal the decision-making process.
Narrow the focus
When forming questions, simplify and focus your questions to 
a narrower point. Questions that are too broad based and general
may be difficult for a prospect to answer or at least summarize in 
a way that’s helpful. The prospect may not even know how to begin
answering questions like “What do you look for in a supplier?”;
“How do you choose a vendor?”; or “What do you expect from 
this type of service?”
If, for example, you want to know what the company looks for in 
a provider, try asking the prospect to share past experiences:
“What were the determining factors you used in selecting your
current vendor?”
“What were the factors that made you terminate your relationship
with your previous provider?”
Tap into fantasy
Often, prospects have difficulty defining exactly what it is they
want or need from a provider. Instead of asking a prospect to tell
you what kind of company he wants to work with, get him to tap
into his imagination.
For example, have you ever heard a single friend try to describe the
type of person she wants to meet? “Oh, I don’t know . . . someone
nice, with a sense of humor. Nice looking. I guess I’ll know when I
meet him.” Yet if you ask her which actor or celebrity she finds most
desirable? “George Clooney,” she says without missing a beat. Or if
you tell her to describe the perfect first date: “We meet at a park and
stroll past flower gardens as we’re lost in conversation. . . .” Well,
you get the idea.
Try the same technique with a tongue-tied prospect.
“If we could create the ideal situation, what would it look like?”
“If you had the perfect _______________ designed for you, what
would it have?”
Chapter 10: Getting Out of the Answers and Into the Questions 141

“If you could design the perfect solution to the problem we are
discussing, what would it have?”
Focus on benefits before features
Results-focused questions help identify the bottom-line benefits the
prospect is seeking. For example, instead of hammering on about
the features of your widget — such as improved design, smaller size,
or fast performance — ask questions that pinpoint the results that
are important to the client. If you find out that she’s looking for 
a widget that can cut production time in half, you can then focus 
on the fast-action features of the widget rather than the slim,
streamlined look.
Questions that uncover the desired benefits may include:
“How will you define outstanding results?”
“What will cause you to know you received good value?”
“How will you measure a successful result?”
Present a choice
If your prospect resists answering direct questions, you can 
ask questions that offer choices. This technique is a gentler way to
extract information, one that is often used for 3-year-olds establish-
ing their independence (“What do you want for breakfast today —
cereal with a banana-and-raisin face or cowboy eggs?”).
Instead of pointed questions such as “Bob, where are you 
getting your widgets now?” or “Bob, what is your budget for this
project?” you can ask questions in a way that the prospect has 
a choice between two answers, which creates a feeling of control. 
For example:
“Bob, are you getting office supplies from XYZ Company or 
ABC Company?”
“Is your budget for this project more or less than $1 million?”
Avoiding Question Quicksand
Salespeople can make a handful of missteps during their question-
ing. In the heat of the moment of working with a prospect, falling
Part III: You Make the Call! 
142

back on these mistakes is easy. When you don’t know what to say 
or where to go next, that is when slip-ups surely rear their ugly head.
This section highlights some question situations you don’t want 
to get stuck in.
Sounding like a survey
Often, inexperienced salespeople are directed by their sales 
managers to stick to the script. It’s fair advice. But a combination 
of nervousness and unfamiliarity with the process often results 
in a detached and robot-like effect when you follow the script 
too closely. Although scripts are essential for every salesperson’s
success, you want to avoid coming off as if you’re conducting 
a survey. (Check out Chapter 4 for developing a script.)
Invest time, in advance of your calls, to familiarize yourself with
the script and anticipate the possible responses (not many new
ones are out there). Then use feedback-response techniques to
create a sense of dialogue with the prospect. Don’t jump into the
next question, but instead, react to the prospect’s response, using
words like great, fantastic, terrific, ouch, or I’m sorry.
Then replay the response. And remember: Feed back the prospect’s
response; don’t parrot the exact words the prospect used. Here’s an
example of a good feedback response:
“Mr. Jones, I’m hearing that you have concerns about the cost of
replacing your copier with the newest, high-tech versions. Is my
understanding correct?”
This type of feedback helps create a connection and moves you
away from sounding like prerecorded, automated blah.
Asking GIGO questions
When querying your prospect, you want to stay away from GIGO
questions. GIGO is a computer term from the 1970s that stands for
“garbage in, garbage out.” It refers to the truism that if you input bad
information, your output will be bad information. Likewise with the
questions you ask during your sales call: Bad questions result in
worthless answers.
What makes for a bad question? Avoid anything that may open 
you up for negative observations of your company, queries that
are so general they simply won’t elicit a meaningful response, and
Chapter 10: Getting Out of the Answers and Into the Questions 143

questions that may generate questions that you aren’t prepared to
answer. Here are a few GIGO questions to avoid:
 Do you have any questions for me?
 Do you need anything else from me?
 Is the product or service you’re currently getting acceptable
to you?
These questions lead nowhere and almost assure you a response
that you don’t want . . . a negative one.
Avoiding a premature presentation
When a prospect throws up a stall, question, concern, or objection,
your knee-jerk reaction may be to leap into presentation mode in
order to counter the concern. Resist at all cost! This is a diversion-
ary tactic on the prospect’s part (whether she realizes it or not). 
If you fall for it, you’re sure to get off-course.
You shouldn’t take lines such as “I have a concern about . . .” or “I
don’t know if you would be right for us” as an opening for objection-
handling techniques or benefits-and-value discussions. Instead,
these are openings for a professional to deliver more questions to
uncover more information. Respond with:
“If we can take a few more minutes so I can find out more about
your concerns, I will be better able to combine my responses to
what will be most beneficial to you”
“With your permission, let me ask you a few more questions, so 
I can really understand your situation and so I know I am making
the correct recommendations for you and your company.”
The only way to get back on track is to ask questions at this point.
Asking the right questions can help turn around your sinking ship.

Chapter 11
Mastering the Art of Listening
and Silence
In This Chapter
 Sharpening your listening skills
 Encouraging prospects to talk
M
any salespeople like to listen . . . to themselves. Chances
are, you’ve followed a career path in sales because family
members and friends have always told you that you have the “gift
of gab.” Reaching out to strangers, initiating conversations, and
making others comfortable are indeed qualities that make for great
salespeople. But more important — much more important — than
the gift of gab is the gift of listening.
In any situation involving a salesperson and a prospect or client, 
one party is more important than the other; one individual carries
the more critical information, relevant experience, and valuable
opinions and comments. Hint: It isn’t the salesperson! The prospect
or client holds the key to unlocking the secrets that lead to a sale.
This is especially true for phone sales: Because the nature of the
medium precludes the telltale signals of body language, you must
listen even more closely for verbal messages and other sound 
clues (for instance, does the clicking of keyboard keys indicate 
the prospect is distracted by another project?).
Why is listening so important? The answer to why is this: more 
sales, shorter sales cycle, higher conversion of leads, and more
referrals. In this chapter, I show you the link between listening and
better sales results. And after you understand the importance of 
the why, the how becomes much easier. The more you can orient
yourself to listen, the more you’ll see sales results mounting up.

Honing Your Listening Skills
Proactive, type-A, energetic, action-oriented sales professionals
may have difficulty imagining themselves as listeners. After all, 
listening is so passive. Don’t you have to do something to make 
a sale? Absolutely! You have to listen.
Listening is an active behavior. It requires much greater focus than
talking — you expend a lot of energy to capture, record, process,
and catalogue the data you pick up when listening. So discard any
notion that what I’m talking about is defined by “doing nothing.”
Listening effectively isn’t easy work. Holding yourself back from
blathering can be a struggle. Asking good questions and shutting 
up for answers is a challenge. But this kind of hard work pays off 
in a big way.
Listening is also a smarter way to work, for through listening — 
not talking — you can discover with more certainty the prospect’s
wants, needs, expectations, timeframe, desires, motivation, author-
ity to take action, and financial ability. This edge enables you to
transition to your sales presentation more confidently and increase
your chances for a close exponentially. (See Chapter 12 for details 
on executing powerful sales presentations.)
Effective listening brings about an interesting bonus for salespeople:
As you exercise your listening muscle and gather more information
to turn prospects into clients and better serve your customers, they
perceive that they’re getting to know you, as well. They begin to
define you and your company as caring, trustworthy, professional,
and reliable. You have opened the door to a quality, long-term serv-
ice relationship! And it’s all because you kept your mouth closed
and listened.
In the following sections, I share some tips for sharpening your 
listening skills, and I steer you clear of a few mistakes that may
block effective listening.
Three secrets of effective listening
As I say earlier in this chapter, listening is an active sport. And it’s
all the more challenging because listening demands extreme atten-
tiveness and mental acuity while keeping your mouth shut and
allowing someone else to hold the floor. (Ever wonder why you’re
so exhausted after one of those all-day business seminars? Despite
the fact that you’ve been sitting for nearly eight hours, your brain
has been working overtime capturing and processing all the infor-
mation.) Three listening practices, however, can be considered the
Part III: You Make the Call! 
146

steroids of the phone-sales league (except that they’re totally
legal!).
Always take notes
You don’t need to be a stenographer to be effective at note taking.
Just jotting down key concepts, problems, issues, and company info
directly from the prospect will do. The act of taking notes forces you
to stay focused on the prospect and what he is saying. Your mind is
less likely to wander or jump to what you want to say next.
Tell the prospect that you’re taking notes to better work with him.
Here’s a sample script:
“Mr. Smith, I’m taking notes because I don’t want to miss any-
thing and need this critical information you are sharing with me
to better serve you.”
By telling Mr. Smith in advance that you’re taking notes, he appreci-
ates that you’re so interested in what he’s saying that you don’t
want to lose a single thought. He thinks, “This guy is different than
the other salespeople.” Also, he is more understanding when you
ask him to repeat something or slow down or give you a moment,
like in the following script:
“Mr. Smith, I am sorry, but my shorthand needs a little help. 
I want to clarify the information on _______________. Could 
you please go over that again, so I can get it on paper?”
If you have a customer relationship manager (CRM) software pro-
gram to help you capture prospect information, I suggest typing this
data into the CRM while you’re listening. A CRM is the software you
use to store your contacts’ and prospects’ information. Examples of
CRM software would be Act, Goldmine, or Salesforce.com. Using a
CRM means you don’t have to re-enter information later from hand-
written notes — that’s double entry and double the work. Again,
your prospect is likely to hear the clicking of your keys, so be sure
to explain that you’re entering notes into the software program as
he talks.
Ask more questions
The person asking the questions is the one in control of the conver-
sation. The asker is the receiver of information. And information, 
as you know, is power. You won’t learn anything by talking — you
already know all that you know. “Even a fool appears wise until they
open their mouth,” goes an old proverb. Project your brilliance
through the questions you ask.
Chapter 11: Mastering the Art of Listening and Silence 147

Having trouble getting started? Let me share with you a few very
effective general questions you can use to prompt the speaker.
These basic queries jump you out of the “stall” position and move
your listening and discovery process forward:
 “Can you elaborate on that?”
 “Can you give me a little more perspective on that issue?”
 “Can you explain to me how this works?”
 “Can you review that again for me?”
 “Bob, I’m not quite sure what you mean.”
See Chapter 10 for more details on questioning your prospect or
client effectively.
Move to instant replay
If you’ve done the first two steps correctly (see previous sections),
you will be granted the third step. At this point, you want to verify
that all the detail you’ve captured is correct. The only way to do
that is to review and summarize what you understood the prospect
to convey. Check out the following sample script:
“So, Bob, let me see if I am on the right track. You are wanting to
increase your communication between departments in your com-
pany. You feel that having an intranet would be a big step in
accomplishing those goals. Being able to send video messages
that you can record from your desk and send to your employees
in your offices is the U.S., Europe, and Asia would be a big plus
for you. Is that correct?”
Don’t repeat word for word what the prospect or client said. Some
prospects will become offended or feel that you are using a sales
technique on them. Your job is to summarize accurately and inter-
pret what you heard — not act like a myna bird. Do, however, try to

Get ’em to spill the beans
If I want to communicate with Wesley, my 5-year-old son, all I have to do is ask ques-
tions and the floodgates open. He tells me about his day, how he felt, what was awe-
some, what other kids did, what he wants to do tomorrow, how much he loves me,
and so on. I get all this information simply by asking a few questions. Wesley, like
most other human beings of any age, wants to share, but shares much more when
prompted by questions.

use the same jargon for specific industry trademark and company
terms; this act shows you have done your homework.
When you engage in “instant replay,” your prospect often does 
one of these three things:
 Confirms that your understanding is correct.
 Corrects your instant replay.
 Gives you new and additional information.
All these outcomes are good — with any one of them, you know
you have it right when you hang up the phone, plus you may have
gotten bonus information. Typically, the detail a prospect or client
adds after the instant replay is the really important stuff. You made
it past the surface issues and now have insider information that
your competitors may not have been savvy enough to unearth.
When a prospect adds information at the replay stage, you 
must repeat this step. Yes, it’s time for another instant replay. 
Run through your summary again, with the new details this time,
and conclude with a phrase such as:
 “Do I have it right?”
 “Bob, am I on the right track?”
 “How does that sound?”
Picking up nonverbal signs
In a face-to-face sales situation, a prospect’s body language commu-
nicates a vast amount of information. But how about over-the-phone
sales efforts? Although you can’t see nonverbal messages such as
eye blinking, head nodding, and clock watching, you can still tune in
to unspoken signals that indicate interest, rejection, boredom, and
other responses. The nonverbal signals can give you an indication
as to how you are doing and where you are in the sales process. And
your listening skills are what help you pick up these signals.
Listen for background noise. Taking a pause (check out the sec-
tion, “Using the pause to your benefit” later in this chapter) may 
be helpful — it’s hard to detect what’s going on around the prospect
when you’re talking. You may hear another person interrupting your
prospect with a question, detect the muffled sound of the prospect’s
hand cupping the phone, or pick up on the squeak of a chair as the
prospect leans back. You may hear the click of keys on a calculator
and surmise that she is adding up the numbers you’re sharing — 
a sign that the prospect may be ready to buy!
Chapter 11: Mastering the Art of Listening and Silence 149

If you pick up signs that you have lost the prospect or she is bored,
one technique to get her back on focus is to start a statement with
her name. By inserting her name before a statement, you gain three
to four seconds of attention; you better make what comes next
good.
Three mistakes that block listening
Sometimes, one of the best ways to master a skill is to find out how
not to do it. In doing so, you apply the 180-degree theory to success.
When approaching the sales situation with listening in mind, sales-
people must work to avoid the following three common reactions.
Overpreparation: “I’ve got this nailed”
Rehearsing scripts and dialogues definitely aids in a smooth deliv-
ery and response during sales presentations (see Chapter 4 for the
basics on using scripts). But you can have too much of a good thing:
When you prepare to the point where you’re too focused on your
script and responses, you run a high risk of losing your listening
focus. You’re so tied to the script that you’re ready to lurch forward
with the next line — and miss the nuances that ought to be shaping
your next line in order to make the script come alive.
“What?” you may be thinking. “Dirk has hammered on scripts and
dialogues and thorough pre-call preparation for numerous chapters,
and now he’s changing direction?” I’m definitely not changing
direction, merely waving a caution flag.
By all means, practice, practice, practice your sales script! But,
remember, the sales call isn’t a performance in which you’re the 
star. If anything, think of it more as improvisational theater: You’re 
a skillful and prepared professional who is poised to respond to
any scenario tossed your way. Imagine an actor thrown into a pie-
throwing comedy scene and reciting Hamlet’s soliloquy. Something
similar can happen if you listen with one ear and use most of your
brain to call up your next stock answer. You may miss some critical
information that could help you close a sale.
Butting in and showing off: “I’m the expert; just ask me”
When you’re more focused on what you’re going to say next, 
you miss a critical opportunity to hear some valuable information.
Maybe your mouth is shut and you’re mumbling the appropriate
“um-hmms” — but all the while, you’re looking for openings to flex
your mental muscles. You’re channeled on opportunities to butt in
and show off how prepared and knowledgeable you are about your
client’s needs, rather than really hearing your client’s needs.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
150

Of course, you’re eager to move the process along, closer to 
the point when the client says, “I’ll take it!” You want to show the
client how much you know. But this eagerness can shut down your
sense of hearing — and possibly lead to cutting off the client in
mid-sentence. Just keep in mind that what the prospect has to say 
is always more important than what the salesperson has to say.
Try applying the three-second rule. You wait three seconds to
respond to a prospect’s questions. It insures that you have time 
to formulate your response and also not interrupt the prospect.
Leaping into your pitch before listening: 
“Enough about you; how about me?”
A close cousin to the “I’m the expert; just ask me” scenario (from
the preceding section), this circumstance results when you stop
listening to the client because you’re intent on finding an opening
to leap into your pitch. Your radar is picking up only the cues that
may serve as your entrée into the presentation.
I despise the term sales pitch, but when salespeople fall victim 
to the enough-about-you syndrome, this is exactly what the sales
presentation turns into: They home in on any signal that tells them
the prospect is ready to bat, and then start the wind-up and throw
their pitch. To resist the urge to leap into your pitch, be sure to
pause or take a deep breath before you respond.
Prompting More Dialogue 
through Silence
Earlier in this chapter, I establish that not talking is one of the
salesperson’s greatest strategies for successful selling, and I help
you sharpen your listening skills. Another important telephone-
sales tool is the effective use of complete silence during your sales
calls. In the following sections, I show you some silent tactics for
encouraging a prospect to open up and yield more information
that you can use to close the sale.
Using the pause to your benefit
The difference between great and good is very little. As little 
as a fraction of a second for an Olympic swimmer. In telephone
sales, as well, the smallest detail can separate the champion sales
professional from the many good salespeople out there. In selling,
instead of inches and seconds, greatness is measured in words —
and how they’re used . . . or not used.
Chapter 11: Mastering the Art of Listening and Silence 151

Sometimes, the brief seconds that pass after the prospect stops 
talking can be the small difference that elevates a sales professional
from good to great. When you’ve just wrapped up running through
one of the benefits of your service, allow the silence to linger before
diving into the next benefit. You want your prospect to feel the full
weight of your information before you ask for the order.
Sure, allowing that dead air to linger can be scary. Silence in 
the middle of a conversation feels awkward and uncomfortable.
Your instinct is to fill it up, but the pause is a powerful tool for 
the salesperson. During that sound void, your prospect may 
volunteer an opinion or reaction. To a salesperson, such volun-
teered details are extremely important. What a prospect says after
answering a question from you can be infinitely more valuable than
the initial response. The pause gives the prospect time to consider
and process your information. If you step into the pause, you invali-
date or weaken your last question. More often than not, you’ll be
rewarded when you use the pause and wait for the prospect to 
offer more crucial detail.
Here’s an example of a conversation between a salesperson and 
a prospect that effectively uses the pause:
Prospect: “We made a decision to go another way.”
Sales Rep: (pause) “Oh?”
Prospect: “Well, not completely another way. Orders have come
down from above to hold off and analyze a little further before
we finalize training budgets for next year.”
Sales Rep: “I see.” (pause)
Prospect: “When we are released by the upper management in 30
days, you have a good opportunity to be part of next year’s budget.
Between you and me, you have a high probability of being a pre-
ferred trainer, but you will need to wait this out before we can dis-
cuss details.”
The salesperson discovered that what seemed like a “no” was
really just a delay. He went from a-decision-to-go-another-direction
status to preferred-trainer status in a few minutes. The salesperson
kept the dialogue going by pausing and not talking. The prospect
did the rest.

152

Reading between the lines
You’ll encounter situations in which your “I see” prompts and 
carefully placed pauses don’t elicit more info. When that occurs,
read between the lines. To yourself, ask the following questions:
 Was my presentation off?
 Did I miss a need that was expressed?
 Is the timing off?
You don’t have much time to evaluate — you want to keep the flow
of conversation moving. To get between the lines if they’re blurry,
ask the prospect these questions:
“Bob, what did I miss?”
“How do you feel about that?”
“Is there anything that can be done to reverse your decision?”
“Where do we go from here?”
The ability to read between the lines is a skill you develop over 
time. As you become thoroughly familiar with your product or
service and its clientele, you develop a sixth sense about the 
invisible messages that can be summoned by your prompts, 
pauses, and — when necessary — your questions.
Chapter 11: Mastering the Art of Listening and Silence 153
The power of the pause
Arthur Rubinstein, the world-famous pianist, was once asked how he handled the
notes so masterfully. He responded, “I handle the notes no better than many others,
but the pauses . . . ah! That is where the art resides.” Like a brilliantly played piece
of music, your sales presentation can also evoke emotional responses, simply 
by the way you handle the pauses between your words. Let the power of the 
pause take over. Rubinstein would let the note resonate throughout the hall. Let your
questions and information resonate over the phone.

Presentations
In This Chapter

T
he sales presentation: It’s an art, a skill — some may even say a
science. However you define it, the effectiveness of the sales
presentation — particularly for the telephone salesperson — is the
apex in the process of transforming a prospect into a customer. A
powerful sales presentation doesn’t just happen. It’s orchestrated,
honed, and formulated. You can’t just go off the cuff or by your gut,
and you don’t get bonus points for spontaneity or being
impromptu.
Throughout the sales process, you’ve discovered the importance
of putting time and thought into every step. Those preparations all
lead to this point: the sales presentation. In this chapter, I walk you
through the structure of a solid presentation and explore how to
approach the presentation process in two distinct scenarios. I also
share valuable tips on delivery.
The Fundamentals of a 
Dynamite Presentation
The sales presentation, like a sturdy building, consists of individual
components that fit together to support a solid effort. Each building
block plays an important role — leave one out and the presentation
may wobble or even tumble down. But don’t worry; none of the

components of the sales presentation are that complicated or 
difficult to acquire. This section adds them up.
Starting with a qualified prospect
To deliver the best sales presentation for a particular prospect, 
you must have gone through the qualification process before your
presentation. Unqualified prospects are like the kernels that don’t
pop into popcorn. If you can identify those kernels ahead of time —
you can weed them out of the bag before you stick them into the
microwave. Or cook them longer to get them to pop.
Qualifying prospects is, in essence, prescreening to determine their
likelihood of buying. By gathering answers to key questions, you can
flag those individuals who probably won’t “pop.” Or if you discover
what the barriers are, you might be able to butter them up in a pres-
entation that better addresses their unique needs. (For a step-by-
step walk-through of the qualifying process, check out Chapter 10.)
Letting the prospect 
know what’s coming
Don’t you hate meetings where there’s no agenda, no clear purpose,
and no hint as to how long you’re going to be held captive? Meeting
hosts who walk you through the agenda, on the other hand, help
establish expectations among the attendees. You know that as soon
as you check off each item on the handout, the meeting is over. This
knowledge puts you at ease and, chances are, you’ll be engaged and
even participate more as you anticipate each point on the list.
Apply this preview strategy when opening your sales presentation:
At the get-go, guide the prospect through the points of your plan to
establish a sense of the timeframe, content, and order in which you
plan to discuss the content.
Your presentation really begins after your opening statement to
grab the prospect’s interest. It occurs after you have qualified the
prospect to ensure a presentation can be made. If your sales cycle
involves more than one sales call, the presentation usually hap-
pens after the initial call, during the second call or later. That time-
line allows you to use the agenda approach.
Adding value for the prospect
Your presentation should be packed with value — after all, you
intend to sell a product or service that helps the prospect save
Part III: You Make the Call! 
156

money, make money, achieve business goals, have a better quality 
of life, or solve an existing problem. However, you want to give the
individual something valuable that he can take with him and use
later.
If you’ve asked enough questions in qualifying (see “Starting with 
a qualified prospect” earlier in this chapter), you can add value
through your consultative recommendations. Realize that you’re 
a fresh set of eyes, ears, and cognitive thinking that can be the right
combination to break through a tough challenge that’s stumped
the prospect and his company for years. Whether it’s a series of
economic findings that influence business decisions, insider news
about changes in the industry, or new strategies to increase sales 
or reduce costs, the operative word is value.
Solving the prospect’s problems
In essence, people buy solutions to their problems. Your mission, 
if you choose to accept it, is to demonstrate how your product or
service solves the problem better, faster, cheaper, or more thor-
oughly than any other possibility. In order to do that, you first
want to quantify the prospect’s problem.
Quantifying begins with qualifying — your questions should’ve
determined the cost of this problem to the prospect or company —
in terms of budget, revenue, time, materials, labor, and other factors.
Then based on that information, you’re armed to present your
solution.
You may base your solution on cost — yours is cheaper than the
competitor’s or the current provider’s. But you’re wiser to offer 
a solution that
 Reduces labor
 Shortens production time
 Increases output
 Requires fewer employees
 Demands fewer resources
Keeping it short and to the point
A sales presentation needs to be exact and to the point. You can’t
expect a sales prospect to hang in there with you for longer than
20 or 30 minutes. At that point, the ability to pay attention plum-
mets dramatically — no matter how charming and personable you
are. (Even sitcoms last only a half-hour.)
Chapter 12: Executing Powerful Presentations 157

You don’t need any more time than 30 minutes if you’ve qualified
your prospect, kept your purpose in mind, and set your agenda (see
the preceding sections). If you’re attempting to present enough info
to persuade the prospect to meet with you face to face, your phone
call should take less than 15 minutes.
To help keep your presentation short and to the point, remember
the following pre-planning pointers:
 Be sure to know, before the day of the presentation, who
will be present so you can research and prepare. By know-
ing who’s attending, you can gear your presentation toward
those individuals.
 Take roll at the beginning of the call. Doing so alerts you
who’s actually in attendance. You want to demonstrate 
professionalism and organization.
 Make sure you engage everyone in attendance. You want to
interact with each person and ask for questions or concerns.
The exception to this rule is the support staff who are there to
record the conversation and keep notes, unless the person is
the gatekeeper who helped you. Then you want to engage that
person and recognize him for his role.
Building your credibility
The best way to firmly establish your credibility is to know the
prospect and the prospect’s company. Chapter 4 tells you where
and how to dig up background information about the company.
This detail puts you in good stead throughout the sales process,
but especially during the sales presentation.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
158
Don’t play the cost-cutting game
Emphasizing lowest cost to solve your prospects’ problems may be hazardous to
your wealth, at least if you plan to get rich on sales commissions. If you’re inclined
to focus on cost in your sales presentation, just remember the old sales adage:
“Value = Benefits – Cost.” You’re wiser to increase the benefit to the prospect, so
the cost issue is overshadowed and a greater value is perceived.
No business in the world operates on lowering cost — or they shouldn’t. A growing
company always zeroes in on increasing sales or productivity. Your job in the sales
presentation is to show how you can increase the client’s productivity or sales — not
sell the cheapest widget in the industry.

From this information, you can shape your presentation accordingly.
For example, if you discovered on the corporate Web site that one 
of the company’s core values is environmental responsibility, you
can emphasize how your product is made from 100-percent recycled
content. This point illustrates that you have a good understanding
of the prospect’s unique needs and, therefore, are a credible source
for an effective solution.
Another method of conveying credibility is offering names of 
referrals from satisfied clients. Why? You can assure the prospect
all day and night that using your product brings success, but the
testimonial from someone who’s already had a successful experi-
ence with your company speaks volumes more. “If it can work for
that guy,” thinks the prospect, “it’ll work for me.”
Making Your Presentation
Many companies have a pre-scripted sales presentation that all
salespeople are required to follow — to the T. In other firms, the
script may be an outline with wiggle room for customized conver-
sation based on the salesperson and the client.
Whether you follow a word-for-word script, are guided by a basic
presentation framework, or you’re completely on your own, I firmly
believe in a planned presentation model. In other words, follow a
script, of your own making or otherwise. You may skip over critical
points if you don’t have the script written out and rehearsed.
Although scripts differ, all should
 Address the prospect’s unique circumstances
 Show a solution to the prospect’s problem
 Highlight the key benefits your product or service offers
 Establish your credibility as the solution to the prospect’s
problem
But the particulars and the choreography of the presentation are
determined by a number of factors. This section highlights two 
different ways you can make your presentation.
Moving into a one-step sale
What you sell determines the complexity of the sales presentation
process. If, for example, you offer a fairly straightforward product 
or service that’s familiar to the prospect — and one that isn’t 
considered a significant investment — you may expect to step
Chapter 12: Executing Powerful Presentations 159

from prospecting to qualifying and information gathering to sales 
presentation to close in a single call. Common one-call products 
and services include long-distance services, cable television plans,
office supplies, and Internet services. The following sections detail
what you need to know to make a successful one-step sales 
presentation.
Transitioning to presentation
You can only wrap up a one-step sale if you can do it in a reason-
ably short amount of time. You want to move from the qualifying
question phase into the presentation as quickly and efficiently 
as possible. As soon as you’ve gathered enough information and
raised the needs, wants, and concerns of your prospect, you can
prepare to dive into the presentation.
How do you know when you’re ready to move from questions 
to presentation? Listen carefully for these signals:
 When the prospect identifies a need to take action
 When the prospect quantifies a desired result
To move along the question-to-answer process, ask questions 
like these:
 Have you been considering a change?
 What specifically is causing you to consider a change?
 Is this a recent consideration, or have you been thinking
about it for some time?
 If there were a solution to this problem we are talking 
about, how valuable would that be to you?
Reviewing the situation
Before you leap at the chance to move into your presentation, 
stop and take just 30 seconds to a minute to confirm what you 
discovered. It’s easy to get excited when you have a prospect lean-
ing your way. But taking the time to summarize and repeat helps
ensure that you understand the prospect’s need clearly. You might
start with the following script:
“Bob, so I am confident I know what your needs and wants are,
let me summarize our discussion thus far. . . .”
“Bob, to be certain we are on the same page, let’s review what
we’ve talked about thus far. . . .”
“Bob, let me make sure I understand and that we are working
together on this. You want . . .”

160

Steering clear of a wreck
Who can anticipate all the possible scenarios that may derail your
presentation? Maybe the prospect is pressed for time. Maybe it’s
clear that the prospect is distracted or keeps allowing interrup-
tions. Maybe you just can’t get her off a particular sticking point
that she refuses to back down on.
When you find yourself heading for a wreck, don’t keep driving
toward the close. Change course — and fast. Put on the brakes and
set up a second presentation. It’s easy to turn a one-step presenta-
tion into two steps, especially when it raises your odds of closing.
You can use scripts like the following:
“Bob, just so you know, I typically meet with the client twice. 
The first meeting is to determine your goals and objectives, and
the second one is to review my recommendations.”
“Bob, in order to provide you with the best service, I usually go
back to my office and prepare my analysis of your situation, and
we will talk again in a few days for a short meeting. Would
Thursday or Friday later this week work for you?”
This fallback gives you a chance to collect the other decision
makers if needed, align with a better timeframe, create solutions
for their concerns, and even have your sales manager help you 
if needed.
Now and later: The two-step 
presentation model
Whether your sales cycle is more effective with a two-step presen-
tation or you have made the switch to a two-step model because of
road blocks erected by the prospect, you must commit to it. A two-
step model is when you fact-find, probe, question, and qualify the
prospect in one call. You then independently research, evaluate,
and prepare for a second appointment to make a presentation of
your conclusions and benefits to the client, ending with a close.
The first step has only a trial close to confirm a presentation
appointment and potential conditions of service and satisfaction 
of the prospect. The second step is the actual presentation where
you are closing for the signed agreement, purchase order, or 
whatever mechanism you use to secure the order.
If your product or service is more complex or costly, the questioning
phase is almost certain to be a first step, followed by a more formal
sales presentation. Some other situations in which the sales 
presentation is singled out as its own meeting include
Chapter 12: Executing Powerful Presentations 161

 When your product or service is complex and requires 
in-depth explanation and information
 When your product or service is a high-ticket item
 When you’ve run into objections at the initial sales 
presentation that require further work on your part
 When you discover some information you didn’t have 
in your initial presentation that requires you to reload
 When you discover in your initial presentation that more
people are involved in the decision-making process
 When a face-to-face presentation is critical to the close
Nothing is wrong with a two-step model when desires, needs, 
abilities, and authority are determined in the first step. You should
have enough benefits to pique the prospect’s interest to secure the
second appointment when the real presentation and closing will be
conducted.
Prepping at the question phase
In step one of the two-step presentation, you’re on a fact-finding
mission, doing company recognizance. You want to find out what
the prospect’s problems, challenges, needs, wants, and desires
currently are, as well as internal processes for making changes,
decision making, and more. You want to explore the typical process
of changing vendors of suppliers. How do they go about making 
big decisions? You find this info out by asking questions.
When you know from the start that you’ll be scheduling a dedicated
presentation meeting, it’s a good idea to demonstrate some benefits
and value at this point so the prospect is interested in hearing more.
Don’t give it all away on this call. The key is giving enough so the
prospect wants to find out more.
Booking the presentation
After you complete the exploratory phone call, landing the
appointment for the presentation is critical. Don’t hang up the
phone until you book it! If you end the call without the appoint-
ment, you may lose your opportunity. Now that the prospect has
hung up without further commitment, he may simply dodge your
future attempts at contact, or, worse, he may do business with
someone else before you have the chance to schedule. Setting the
presentation for a separate time allows you to prepare more effec-
tively because you can devote time to organizing all the benefits
and results for an organized and professional delivery.
Part III: You Make the Call! 
162

To snag the presentation appointment, avoid asking in a way that
allows the prospect to say no. Try assuming that you’ll meet and
offer some choices on times. For example, look at these scripts:
“Bob, there is no doubt in my mind that these new copy
machines would provide you what you need. Would Wednesday
or Thursday next week work better to meet and discuss your
options further?”
“Fred, I am convinced, after spending this time with you, that our
widget could help you reduce your production costs by at least 18
percent. Would Thursday or Friday later this week work better for
you to meet and explore the benefits more thoroughly?”
The most challenging part of the two-step model is setting an
appointment and determining whether it should be a telephone
presentation or a face-to-face presentation. The securing of the
presentation appointment is the toughest step and is where most
salespeople fail.
Locking in a Successful Delivery
Whether one-step or two, over the phone or face-to-face, all 
successful sales presentations are driven by your delivery — the
intangible qualities that make your presentation rock-solid. You
can work with an A-plus presentation outline, but if your delivery
lacks the qualities in this section, your effort can flop as badly 
as Hamlet’s soliloquy performed by a parrot.
Staying in control
Controlling the presentation is a delicate effort. You want to be loose
enough to respond to and fine-tune your prospect’s questions, but
you don’t want your carefully crafted presentation to be derailed.
This tragedy can easily happen if
 You lose your place: Your prospect leads you down a rabbit
hole, and you neglect to leave breadcrumbs to get back to
your point.
 You respond to objections before establishing value: You’ve
just started your presentation and the prospect jumps in with
an objection about an issue that you plan to cover later.
When your prospect jumps into the presentation with ques-
tions, objections, or a call for closure, diplomatically wrestle
back control of the conversation. Don’t be a drill sergeant, but
do try something like this:
Chapter 12: Executing Powerful Presentations 163

“I am glad you asked that question; I normally answer that type
of question at the _____ stage of my presentation. Would it be
alright if we talked about it then?”
“I go over those exact issues when I talk about _____ in my 
presentation. Could we wait until then, and if you have further
questions after that discussion, please ask me.”
If you or your company has truly designed an effective presenta-
tion process, follow it. The more you deviate from it, the lower
your sales may be.
Showing conviction
If you expect to convince people that you have the answer to 
their needs, you’d better believe it yourself! If you’re not behind
what you’re selling, believe me, your prospects will figure that out.
Conviction is something that’s hard to fake. If you’re in a sales job
where you’re selling something you don’t believe in, I’d advise you
to get out of it fast and find something you do think is worth sharing
with others.
After you come to the self-awareness that you do believe in what
you sell, the next step is to be sure you convey that conviction in
your presentation. It’s hard for me or anyone else to tell others how
to sell with conviction, but I can guarantee you that the stronger you
believe in what you’re doing, the easier it is to communicate in your
sales presentation.
Expressing enthusiasm
Allow me to share a timeworn sales adage that says it all:
“Enthusiasm is to selling as yeast is to bread; it makes the 
dough rise.”
Enthusiasm sells! A presentation without enthusiasm isn’t worth
watching. If your “show” doesn’t grab your prospects, they turn
you off — even if you don’t realize it. So be sure your positive 
attitude about your offer shines through.
Like conviction (preceding section), enthusiasm is a hard thing 
to fake, so include a little pep talk to yourself as part of your 
preparation efforts.
If you can maintain your enthusiasm for your product, working
through the bumps along the road to a close is easier. For example,
you may have to deliver some bad news to the prospect — the
Part III: You Make the Call! 
164

price is higher than he’d hoped or the delivery can’t be made as
early as requested. If you can impart your enthusiasm for how
happy the client will be with your product, that “bump” is just
something that’s gotten over quickly.
Exhibiting confidence
Confidence for most people, including telephone salespeople,
comes from a history of positive results. But even if you’re new to
your current sales job or even new to telephone sales period, you
can tap into positive experiences from previous jobs and even 
non-work-related successes.
When I entered the sales field, I knew that my edge was my personal
confidence. Mind you, I had no sales experience, and as a new sales-
person, I was no better than any other newbie. I was clueless and
didn’t know diddly-squat about selling. I did know, though, that 
I had an extremely high level of self-confidence that came from
years of athletic success in professional racquetball. I knew that I
was a winner, and that attribute came across in my sales presenta-
tions. Don’t get me wrong; I still had to work plenty hard to succeed
(my sports experience gave me plenty of exposure to hard work),
but that extra shot of confidence leveraged my efforts exponentially.
In coaching thousands of salespeople over the last few years, 
I have discovered that one of the most challenging times is the
advent of a new year. It’s almost as if, when they tear the page 
out of the calendar that reads December, they forget about all 
the success they had the previous year. They lose confidence
because they perceive that they are starting over again from
ground zero.
My advice? Work in a New Year’s resolution to record and review
your victories over the past year — and further back. By document-
ing these successes, you’ll have them at the ready as you prepare
for the next sales presentation and need a little boost.
Communicating assertiveness
Top salespeople are assertive. They ask for the client to commit 
to something, whether that something is merely to review the
material they’re sending, to set an appointment, to review their
budget, or to buy the recommendation. These salespeople don’t
leave a sales opportunity without assertively asking for action.
Some salespeople shy away from this boldness because they equate
assertiveness with aggressiveness. But they’re not the same thing —
and being assertive doesn’t mean being rude or pushy or forceful.
Chapter 12: Executing Powerful Presentations 165

Assertiveness is affirming your belief and conviction in your offer.
And, believe me, your assertiveness arms your prospect with 
assurance that the decision to do business with you is a wise one.
One strategy is to tell the prospect at the beginning of your presen-
tation that you’re going to ask for the business at the end. You don’t
have to use a hard-edged statement. You can be simple, friendly, and
informative — but be straightforward. Check out these examples:
“At the end of my presentation, provided we’re all in agreement,
we’ll finalize the paperwork, so I can begin to work for you right
away.”
“When we conclude in _____ minutes, I will know enough about
your needs, wants, and desires, and you will know enough about
how our _____ will assist you in reaching your goals and objec-
tives that we both will be able to make a decision at that moment
to either work together or not. Does that sound fair?”
Another assertive technique is to use a simple summation close and
connect with a statement of your belief that the prospect should act
on your recommendations now, or that you believe that you offer
the best solution, or that you personally guarantee their satisfaction.
Check out these examples:
“Bob, I know that we can provide the _____ and _____ and _____
that we discussed and you want by end of the month. There is no
question in my mind that this is the right decision for you and
your company; let’s get started so we can meet your time line.”
“Bob, it’s clear that you have done a lot of research on your 
software problem, because you want the software to be _____ 
and _____ and _____. There really is no company that can deliver
those with no risk on your part except my company XYZ software
company. Let’s get the paperwork out of the way so we can make
this happen for you.”

bjections: the bane of the salespersons existence,
right? A sureﬁre sign that you’re going to hang up
without a sale? Guess again. This part covers some of the
most challenging situations phone salespeople — both
newcomers and pros — confront, including addressing
objections, closing the sale now, and turning a failed
sale into future potential. 
In Chapter 13, I identify the most frequently cited
objections and introduce you to my six-step process
for defusing them — as well as your fear of objections.
Chapter 14 unlocks the secrets to successfully obtaining
a client’s commitment and closing for the order now.
And if you don’t get the sale — because sometimes you
won’t — I give you some ways to keep your foot in the

these “failures” into a future sale, if you follow the advice
in Chapter 15.

O
bjections are a fact of life in the sales world — a natural part
of the process. The novice salesperson may see them as a
sign that something is wrong with the prospect, the product, or the
sales pitch. Not only are objections completely normal, but also
they’re healthy and often work to your advantage.
I considered titling this chapter “Embracing Objections,” or
“Welcoming Objections.” Some of you may think “Avoiding Any
Prospect Who Has Objections,” may be a more-fitting name. But
the more comfortable you are with the sales process, the more you
view objections not as a barrier to the sale, but as an opportunity
to provide the prospect with more reasons to buy.
In this chapter, I define and identify the most common objections
that prospects throw out at salespeople. I explain how to prepare
for this resistance, and I offer a surefire strategy for handling any
obstacle, turning it from a stumbling block into a home-team
advantage. So instead of responding like a deer caught in the head-
lights when you’re hit with an objection, you can leap at the chance
to turn a challenge into a close.
Recognizing a Sales Objection 
for What It Really Is
When a prospect starts lobbing objections your way, you can
easily translate this as, “He doesn’t want to buy.” Naturally, you
perceive such resistance as a stall or a barrier — an expression
that the individual doesn’t want or need your product or service.

Part IV: Going for the Close 
170
What exactly is a sales objection and how can you clearly identify
one? When a prospect says, “I want to think it over” or “the other
supplier will do it for less” or “you’re too inexperienced,” you have
just heard an objection.
But instead of seeing an objection as a rejection or a “no,” under-
stand it for what it really is: a request for more information, an
appeal for the knowledge to justify to the prospect that buying
your product or service is the right thing to do, and an opportunity
for you to offer clarification regarding the details the prospect is
questioning.
The objection is a signal that the prospect is interested — so inter-
ested that she’s carefully considering what issues must be
addressed before proceeding with a purchase. If the prospect
wasn’t interested, she wouldn’t have anything to object to!
Eyeing Common Objections
Despite the infinite number of products and services sold over the
telephone, the number of objections is relatively small. They may be
worded differently, but scratch below the surface and you can find
that most resistance reflects no more than a handful of concerns.
That’s good news for the salesperson — preparing for and over-
coming a few issues is an extremely manageable challenge. So take a
deep breath; this section highlights the two most common objections
you encounter. (Figure out how to handle these objections later in
this chapter.)
Cost
The number-one objection you hear as a salesperson is about
price. Are you surprised? Probably not, because you may have had
the same reaction when a salesperson called you on the phone. In
fact, an objection about price can show up in many different forms:
 “I can get it cheaper elsewhere.”
 “I can’t afford that.”
 “It’s not worth that much money.”
 “I’m only prepared to pay half that amount.”
 “I just don’t have the money right now to pay for it.”

No matter how the prospect phrases it, understand this: This
objection isn’t really about cost at all — it’s about value. Instead of
hearing the message, “It costs too much,” recalibrate your ears to
listen for this message: “I’m not yet sold on the value of what
you’re offering.” When price is the objection, value is the answer.
When you focus on the benefits of your service or product —
whether reducing risk, ensuring long-term savings or profit, resolving
a problem, or making life easier — you’re building value. As that
value adds up, the prospect finds it easier to make the decision to
buy — and cost becomes a non-issue. This time-tested but true
sales equation governs the results you’ll achieve when encounter-
ing an objection related to price or cost of goods and services and
ultimately value.
Value = Benefits – Cost
Here’s how it works: Say you’re presenting your business service
to the owner of a company with a problem that’s costing $100,000 a
year in net profit. You can solve the problem — the cost for your
service is $50,000. Without your guidance, the owner may feel that
$50,000 is too high a price to pay for saving $100,000. You, how-
ever, skillfully direct the presentation to preempt that objection.
You point out that the investment in your service is worth $1 mil-
lion in his pocket over a ten-year period! That’s a 100-percent
return on the money he invests.
Timing or delivery
Another common objection you may encounter is about timing or
delivery. A portion of selling is being there at the right time. You
must make sure before you make a presentation that you understand
the prospect’s timing in making a decision. You don’t want the wrong
timing. By questioning the decision maker as to the timing of the
decision or the delivery of service in the qualifying process, you can
lower the odds of being faced with timing and delivery objections.
(Check out Chapter 10 for more info on questioning.)
For example, if you’re making a sales presentation to a prospect
whose decision to purchase new office equipment and the decision
won’t be made until the forth quarter of the year due to budget
timing, but you want to make a full presentation in April, you can ask
appropriate questions and make enough of a presentation to keep in
the running but avoid engaging in the full sales presentation.
The problem with timing could also be a delivery problem or deliv-
ery delay. The two sweetest words after someone is down to the
Chapter 13: Overcoming Objections 171

Part IV: Going for the Close 
172
final decision are right away! After people make a decision to use
your product or service, they want it right away, right now, or even
yesterday. Don’t allow your sales to be thrown off by delivery prob-
lems or delivery delays.
You can also have a plan already in place or in development for
rush orders. Some companies charge more. Others have a contin-
gency plan. If possible, work through these situations with the
operations team ahead of time to make sure there is a plan in place
to handle immediate sales.
Preparing for Objections
One of the secrets to overcoming objections in the sales process is
to always expect objections. Because a handful of issues come up
about 80 percent of the time (see the previous section, “Eyeing
Common Objections”), you can prepare for them simply by antici-
pating these frequently raised challenges. This section helps you
create a battle plan for objections.
Rehearsing responses to resistance
Perfecting your delivery of effective responses to objections
requires practice and role-playing. In order to be prepared for
objections, you first want to be sure you’re familiar with the most
commonly raised objections to buying your particular product or
service. Then, a few times weekly, deliver your boilerplate response
in your office, as you drive, or with a coworker or spouse.
Don’t practice with your prospects; practice before you talk to
them. To be truly prepared, you want to memorize, rehearse, and
internalize multiple ways to overcome each objection you’re likely
to frequently encounter.
Uncovering objections before 
your presentation
The best way to prepare for objections is to uncover potential
objections before they occur. The more you discover about the
prospect ahead of time, the fewer objections you encounter during
the sales appointment. In many situations, you have opportunities
to gather this information prior to the sales presentation.
If the sales process is a two-step process, then you may have a pre-
liminary phone conversation with the prospect in which you can

ask questions. Perhaps the leads you’re working with have already
been qualified, and this information is included in the database.
However you gather it, the more key questions you have answers
to, the better you can anticipate this individual’s objections.
Before your presentation, you want to ask questions covering
five areas:
 Problem/need: Attempt to pinpoint what problems or needs
the prospect has that can be solved by your product or service.
 Experience: Probe into the prospect’s history of using a serv-
ice or product similar to yours, the current provider, and the
consumer’s level of satisfaction with that provider.
 Time frame/motivation: Explore the urgency of the prospect’s
need, the level of interest, and when he’s planning to make a
decision.
 Budget/price: Get a reading on what the prospect expects to
pay for your product or service. What does she consider too
much to pay? What has the prospect paid in the past?
 Expectations: Gauge what needs or wants the prospect
expects will be met. What level of service does he anticipate?
What measure of quality?
The prospects’ responses to these preliminary questions help
answer the questions that in turn help you predict potential objec-
tions during the sales process — your inquiries to the prospect
help you find out the answers to the following:
 How’s the customer going to make the decision?
 When does the customer plan to make a decision?
 Does the customer have the authority to move forward?
 What does the customer want or need?
 Is the customer able to afford the product or service?
 Is the customer strongly motivated to act?
 How does the customer judge a successful sales outcome?
 What competitors is the customer talking to?
 What are the possible threats that may raise objections?
 What objections has the customer raised already?
When you know the answers to these questions, you encounter
fewer objections. You’re also ready for the most likely objections, so
you can prepare professional, confident, and objective responses.
Chapter 13: Overcoming Objections 173

Part IV: Going for the Close 
174
Delaying objections until the end
Objections raised at the wrong time can put a premature kibosh on
your efforts. If the couple you’re talking to about a timeshare week
in Florida has the chance to throw in, “It’s not in our budget,”
before you’ve had a chance to convince them that this opportunity
is so valuable that they can’t afford not to buy, you have a greater
challenge trying to get your derailed presentation back on track.
Price objections in particular tend to come up early, before you’ve
built enough value. The best tactic is to delay the objections until
later in your presentation.
Early on in your conversation with a prospect, ask permission to
hold any questions until later in your presentation. Explain that
you’re likely to address their queries at some point in your talk,
and that you plan to spend as much time as they need after you’ve
finished.
If you e-mail, fax, or mail the meeting outline in advance — or even
simply hand out the agenda if you meet face to face — you’re more
likely to get buy-in of the hold-all-questions tactic. If the prospects
raise an objection, refer to the agenda and assure them that you’ll
address all their concerns at the designated point:
“I thoroughly cover that concern in Step 6 on the outline. Would it
be okay if we talked about it then?”
Rarely do prospects insist, “No, I want to talk about it now.”
Handling Objections 
in Six Easy Steps
No matter how much you prepare for objections, you still have to
face an objection or two before you close in on the finish line.
When you do encounter objections, you need to know how to deal
with them in order to overcome them. Handling objections is a six-
step process. Follow the tried-and-true formula in this section in
the proper order for best results.
Step one: Pause
The pause is a powerful thing. And when it comes to telephone
sales, its powers have even greater potential. Figure out how to
work the pause, and you discover one of the salesperson’s most
valuable strategies. Its benefits are numerous. The pause can

 Give you time to gain control of yourself: When you hear an
objection, your instinct may be to leap into defense mode and
pounce on the prospect with a quick response before she’s
even done speaking. Interrupting a prospect in mid-objection
is the whale of all sales mistakes. The caller can perceive this
act as aggressive or pushy and immediately want to end the
call. The pause only needs to be a moment — a few seconds.
 Create a tension and a shift of control in your direction: The
pause can generate some discomfort that effects a shift of
control, bestowing the “pauser” (you) with a greater measure
of power than the “pausee” (the prospect). Taking a moment
to collect yourself gives you the edge.
 Give you a chance to hear the prospect: In addition to allow-
ing the prospect a chance to think about his reactions, the
pause allows you time to hear the prospect — not only to listen
to the words spoken but also to make sure you understand the
real objection. For more on listening, check out Chapter 11.
Pauses work best if you use them following something significant
the prospect said. Keep pauses to about two to three seconds.
Step two: Acknowledge
Whether you believe the prospect’s objection is valid or ridiculous,
he must feel that you respect his objection, that his view carries
weight, that you heard the objection, and that you understand it.
This action demonstrates that you care about the prospect’s feel-
ings and best interests more than you want a sale.
Acknowledging the prospect’s objection isn’t the same as agreeing
with the prospect. Here are just a few ways you can acknowledge —
none of which requires agreement:
“I can see where that might cause you concern.”
“That’s really a terrific question. I’m glad you asked it.”
“I understand your concern in this area.”
“Thank you — it’s really important that I understand your concerns.”
Another effective technique is to link a probing question to the end
of your acknowledgement statement. By asking the prospect a
question, you convey your concern and build trust. Some of my
favorites include the following:
“I understand your concern in this area. Tell me, why do you feel
that way?”
Chapter 13: Overcoming Objections 175

Part IV: Going for the Close 
176
“I can see where that might cause you concern. Can you tell me
more please?”
“I can appreciate your hesitation. Did you have a previous bad
experience with a salesperson?”
This technique links this acknowledge step (Step 2) with the next
step (covered in the next section, “Step three: Explore”) in a single
script technique.
Step three: Explore
The probing question tacked onto the acknowledgment helps
segue into the third step. This step is the question-asking, explore
phase in which you gather more information about the prospect’s
objection:
 What’s causing the concern?
 Did a previous supplier deliver a bad product or poor service?
 Has the prospect had a negative experience with a salesperson?
 Is it from a horror story of a friend or colleague instead of a
personal experience?
The “But” of the problem
But is a word that doesn’t belong in the vocabulary of a telephone-sales professional.
And especially in a conversation with a prospect who’s raised an objection. Too often,
however, the word pops up — particularly during the acknowledgment step, the point
in which the salesperson recognizes and validates the prospect’s concerns. This effort
can do so much to close the gap between salesperson and prospect. And then the
word but blows up the bridge of understanding.
For example, “I see where that would cause you a concern” is a great acknowledg-
ment statement — so don’t blow it by sticking a but at the end of it. The but negates
everything you’ve said before, clearly saying to your prospect that “I see your point of
view, but you’re wrong” or “I see your concern, but I don’t care; I just want to make a
sale.”
To get beyond the but, use and as the linking word. And is a more effective bridge.
You still get your answer across without the negative sting. Some folks try to get
around but by using the word however. I don’t advise that tactic. In the end, how-
ever is just a but with a bow tie!

The exploration phase assists you in gaining a better understanding
of the size, intensity, and emotion behind his/her objection. Knowing
this info prepares you to effectively answer the concerns. The
exploratory process can take a few questions or minutes. What you
don’t want to do is cut it short; let your prospect talk all they want.
The more the prospect talks, the more quality information you will
receive. You want to make sure that the prospect has an uninhibited
chance to share her concerns at a deeper level.
Step four: Isolate
The fourth step separates the top salespeople from the merely good
sales pros. The isolation phase is what gets you past the smoke and
mirrors to your prospect’s bottom-line barrier. In the isolation
phase, you try to pinpoint what the real problem is. You attempt
through isolation to find out all the problems, barriers, and objec-
tions right now, not later. Most customers prefer not to reveal the
real problem — or they may not even recognize themselves what
their true concern is. Your probing questions help you isolate
whether the objection is based on logic, hesitation, fear, or caution.
Getting to the bottom of the customer’s objection is absolutely
critical — without this understanding, you’re stalled and unable to
move forward. In order for you to take the next step, you have to
know what problems, challenges, feelings, expectations, and emo-
tions are preventing the prospect from taking the next step.
The best way to isolate the true objection is to enlist the prospect’s
help. Use questions like these to measure if you’ve identified the
concern:
“Suppose that we could find a satisfactory solution to this impor-
tant concern of yours. Would you give me the go ahead?”
“Is this the only reason that is holding you back from moving
forward?”
“Other than _______________, is there any other reason you can
think of that would cause you not to make this purchase?”
“If this problem did not exist, would you be ready to proceed
right now?”
All these scripts are extremely effective in getting the prospect to
consider your options, service, or product if the objection is
resolved. Of course, you can’t always meet demands in terms of
price, service, or delivery. But at least you’ve isolated the problem
and can now concentrate on building value — and still have a good
shot at making the sale.
Chapter 13: Overcoming Objections 177

Don’t be afraid to probe for answers. Salespeople are often reluc-
tant to push for information because they fear that they’ll alienate
the prospect and lose the sale. But you can’t lose what you don’t
have! Without asking the questions necessary to isolate the real
problem, you’re unlikely to dissuade the prospect’s concerns.
Step five: Answer
After you isolate the specific objection, you can move into the
answer stage. Your answer requires conviction and solutions. You
must also inject confidence that your company and your products
or services can help achieve the goals and objectives that matter
most to the prospect. And your delivery must be enthusiastic. You
have to be excited for the opportunity for yourself and them.
Enthusiasm sells.
You should be developing answers to the most common objections
for your product or service. Talk with your sales manager to see if
she has standard responses pre-scripted for the most common
objections that you face. Start creating your own file and track the
answers you give and what works well.
Step six: Close
The close follows immediately after your answer. I go into the ins
and outs of the close in Chapter 14. But in short, the close is the
moment when you confirm the agreement to act. This chance is
the time to be bold — to step forward with confidence and
assertiveness. Your conviction that you have the perfect solution
is then transferred to the prospect.
Most top-performing salespeople don’t break between the answer of
an objection and the close or at least a trial close statement. You
want to answer, and then ask prospects to buy or ask them if they’re
in agreement now. Even a simple tie-down close of “does that make
sense” at the end of your answer can do the trick as a trial close.
Move right into the close. Here are some effective closes:
“There is no question in my mind that the solutions we discussed
are exactly what you need. Let’s go ahead and get started now.”
“I am confident that you will be elated with this _______________.
It will perform exactly as we discussed today. Let’s get this
paperwork taken care of, so you can have it right away.”

T
he close of a sale is a complex coming together of many sepa-
rate elements. Your efforts to qualify the prospect, lead through
a series of questions, conduct a presentation, and overcome the dis-
cord of objections all build up to that climactic moment of a
successful sale.
But the close doesn’t happen all by itself. Nor is it a feat that is done
to the prospect; rather, it is working in concert with the customer’s
participation. And although you’re not exactly performing solo,
you’re directing this collaborative effort — and it is up to you to
step up as the conductor. Just as the maestro of a world-renowned
symphony wouldn’t drop his baton and let the orchestra finish up
Beethoven’s Fifth on its own, you must take the lead and guide the
prospect to its harmonious conclusion. This chapter explains why 
the close is important, how you can put together a smooth, success-
ful close, and what you can do to lay the groundwork for a
successful business relationship.
Grasping What Closing Entails
The close is the culmination of all your hard work to link what you’re
selling to the needs, wants, desires, and expectations of your
prospect. If you’ve followed the presentation (check out Chapter
12) and performed each step flawlessly, you may anticipate a natural
crescendo toward resolution. Often, however, the ending is less
apparent. Don’t worry: This section offers a few secrets to move
things along.

Part IV: Going for the Close 
180
Closing: More than just
the destination
Making a successful close is more than the last step you take with
your prospect before everyone signs the deal. In fact, closing starts
at the initial contact and carries forward with each step of the sale.
If your skills are strong in prospecting, lead follow-up, qualifying,
and handling objections, your odds of closing skyrocket. Each
stage of the sales process concludes with a “close” that leads to
the next stage.
Before you hang up the phone from the first call, you must make
your first close — confirm that you’re both ready to take the next
step. Doing so may be that the client simply agrees to review and
consider the information you’ve shared. Or you may schedule a
follow-up appointment.
Even the qualifying stage (check out Chapter 10) ought to include a
close. You’re asking for his expectations and conditions of satisfac-
tion. You can then execute a summation close to ensure you heard
him correctly, such as in the following:
“Bob, I want to make sure I have this right. You want a copier
that copies 50 pages per minute, collates the documents, and has
a stapling feature, correct? So, if we can provide that, will we
have a basis for doing business together?”
The close, at any stage of the sales process, follows the same formula:
“If I do _______________, will you _______________?”
Understanding the Biblical 
truth about closing
“Ask, and you shall receive.” What a wonderful thought. But how
true is it? I’m here to testify to its veracity — at least in the realm
of sales. Let me put it another way, “If you don’t ask, you shall not
get the sale.” When you’re working on a close, make sure you ask
for what you want.
Countless studies have shown that the number-one reason con-
sumers give for not buying is that they weren’t asked. Think about
it: A fisherman who baits his line with his best lure, then props it
against the beer cooler instead of putting it in the water, isn’t going
to come home with a net full of fish. Likewise, a salesperson who
prospects, creates a lead, sends information, follows up, books an
appointment, makes the presentation, but never asks for the sale

will also leave empty handed. The salesperson invested time,
effort, energy, and company resources, but failed to do the simple
step of closing.
This truth is simply a matter of action-reaction. For example:
 Action: Eat three cheeseburgers and a full bag of potato chips
and drink a gallon of soda each day. Reaction: Gain weight.
 Action: Ask for the sale. Reaction: Get the sale.
Okay, fair enough . . . you aren’t guaranteed to get the sale; you
may receive a different response, even if you ask. But I can guaran-
tee this: If you don’t ask, you won’t receive.
Reading the signs and 
using a trial close
Frequently, sales success is a matter of timing. From time to
time throughout the sales process, you may want to determine
whether the prospect’s open to the close. You do this through a
technique called trial close. This technique can be applied in any
of the sales phases.
The power of ASC
At Sales Champions, we use the acronym ASC to refer to what we call Actual Sales
Close. ASC is defined as a selling presentation (whether over the phone or face to
face) that makes a definitive statement of value to the prospect and asks the
prospect to take action — to buy — now.
Over a decade of coaching and training salespeople, I’ve discovered one undeni-
able truth: Top-performing salespeople rack up more ASCs in a week than other
salespeople. Because they ask for the close more often, they’re making more sales.
As part of our program, we require our clients to count and report their weekly ASCs.
We compile and track these numbers among all our clients. Some companies have
sales champions with dozens of ASCs each week. The bottom performers may bring
in less than one per week, and the very worst average just one-half of an ASC a week.
We affectionately call them “half-ASC” salespeople!
Your action plan for this week is to track your number of ASCs. If you focus on driving
that number up, your income will go up proportionally with it.

In essence, a trial close is a test question that measures the
prospect’s receptiveness to buying, such as the following:
“If what we are discussing makes sense, will you be ready to
move forward today?”
“If we can deliver everything you want in our widgets, how soon
would you want us to deliver them?”
“Is this the type of service you are looking for in a financial plan-
ner? Is there anything that I am missing?”
Pushing for a close too early can result in increased resistance
from the prospect and even damage the relationship. Sometimes,
salespeople miss the window of opportunity — when the prospect
is ripe for action. The moment can easily pass, whether the client’s
enthusiasm has diminished or a competitor seizes the opportunity.
Keeping your ear tuned for signals that indicate closing time is
near is critical; particularly if you’re conducting business over the
phone, pay attention to any deviation in speech pattern. The
following could be a sign that the prospect is ready to buy:
 Shifting gears: When the prospect increases the speed of her
speech, that can signal that she’s ready to move ahead.
Likewise, slowing down can indicate that the prospect is in
the final deliberation before the buying stage.
 Attention to details: The prospect homes in on smaller
issues, such as who to call for problems, delivery or service
start date, and finance details. Treat any such questions as a
positive sign that the end is near.
 Finding fault: New objections can indicate that the prospect
is trying to reconcile any last-minute doubts before making a
decision. Objections are requests for more information. To
master objections in the sales process, turn to Chapter 13.
If you don’t pay attention to the signs, you can jeopardize the whole
sale. At worst, another salesperson that you’re competing with for
the business may get the sale because she was more effective at
closing.
You can develop an unlimited number of trial closes for your product
or service. When I was in real estate sales, I sat down and crafted 20
to 30. I practiced them regularly and delivered them with every
prospect. I inserted the trial closes into each stage of my presenta-
tion. In fact, in some cases, after qualifying the prospect, I would sit
down before my presentation and select the trial closes in advance.
It wasn’t by accident that I closed more than 85 percent of the
presentations I made to prospects!

Battling closing phobia
No matter how swimmingly the sales process has gone, getting to
the final reckoning point can induce near catatonia for a salesperson
with fear-of-rejection issues. It’s like proposing to your sweetheart
on national TV — a potential kiss-off at its most personal.
Okay, first off, trust me when I say, “It’s not you.” Rejection is part of
any sales job. You won’t sell what you have to everyone. If everyone
bought, you wouldn’t be selling; you’d be taking orders. So pat
yourself on the back for putting yourself out there and flexing your
sales muscles.
Secondly, look at it this way: You can’t lose what you don’t have.
And you don’t have the sale until the ink dries and the money’s in
the bank. Don’t invest all your emotional capital on this one, single
event. Instead, take a deep breath, smile, and get out there and ask
for the sale.
Reducing contract fallout
The best way to get a contract signed is with a face-to-face meeting.
When you close over the phone, you can expect a greater level of
transaction fallout. But if your business is limited to over-the-phone
interaction, don’t worry: With careful attention and more direct
follow-up in calls and e-mails to make sure that the contract comes
back and the deposit is made, you can keep your recidivism at a low
level.
However, some customers get cold feet when the time comes to
sign the contract. When this used to happen to a sales manager of
mine, he’d say, “Murphy is going to get his.” Referring to Murphy’s
Law, he anticipated losing some sales to this perverse truism that
if anything can go wrong, it will.
But with careful management, you can avoid most of your closes
being lost to Murphy. The secret is to offer a clear and easy
process to the prospect:
 Let the buyer know when the contract will arrive. Giving
them a date lets them know when to expect it.
 Make sure you’re aware of the process the buyer must
follow in order to turn around the agreement. Does he need
a legal review? A sign off by executives? You don’t want to have
to waste time and redo the contract if it’s not done correctly
the first time.

 Pin down how long the client needs to turn around the
contract. Doing so can keep everything on schedule.
 Instruct the client to e-mail or fax a copy of the contract as
soon as it is final and mail you the original copies. You can
keep everything moving without having to wait for the hard
copy.
 Set an appointment to talk to the customer after the contract
should arrive in your office. Follow-up is essential.
 Consider using an overnight delivery service or electronic
delivery of contracts. Doing so speeds up the return of the
contracts and reduces the contract fall-out rate.
These steps should reduce the risk of contract fallout. Because
you’ve been crystal clear about the sequence of events, neither
you nor the client should be uncertain about what’s going on with
the other side. By giving you a copy of the contract immediately,
the buyer is less likely to back out. And by setting an appointment
ahead of time, if the client doesn’t meet the contract return date,
the call gives you an opportunity to give a gentle reminder and
also allows you to gauge the customer’s satisfaction level with
your sales process and service.
Wrapping up: Zip it or rip it
When it comes time to close, silence is golden. Zipping your lip
after you’ve asked for the order is paramount to a successful close.
It’s time to put your new customer in the spotlight. After you’ve
identified the solution to the need, led them to this crossroad, and
asked the critical question, you owe your prospects the space to
decide what is best for them.
The wrap-up begins with a closing question. The closing question
provokes your customer to think, consider, ponder, or even struggle
with a bit of discomfort. And that’s not a bad thing. Your question
puts pressure on the client — and pressure results in change; change
creates action; and that action, as long as you stay out of the way, is
the close of the deal.
Discovering How to Close: The 
Four Best Closing Strategies
Finding the best ways to close for your unique sales circumstances
may take some trial-and-error testing. Books, CD series, DVD train-
ing, and seminars deliver infinite options and variations on themes.
But your goal is to uncover those that work best for you.
Part IV: Going for the Close 
184

You can’t succeed with just one close style, nor is it feasible to
manage an arsenal of 50 techniques. If you have high levels of com-
petency and conviction in about a dozen or so closing techniques,
you’re well-equipped to handle virtually any sales situation.
I stick with the straightforward, time-tested closing techniques in
this section. The more complex your closes, the greater the margin
for error. The longer you talk in closing, the lower the probability
of success. These four methods all involve asking for the order in a
direct, clear manner.
Offering an alternative choice
When you offer an alternative choice with this closing strategy, you
give the customer a sense of control. But the amazing thing is, by
offering even just two choices, you increase the odds exponentially
that the prospect will choose to buy.
The choices you extend must be calculated to produce a positive
response either way. Okay, so you don’t offer: “Would you like to
buy this product, or would you prefer that I leave now without get-
ting your commitment?” Instead focus on two options, such as:
 “Which do you like better — the ocean-view condo or the one
with access to the pool?”
 “Do you prefer the granite countertop in black or gray?”
And you don’t have to make the choice about the product itself. It
can be about delivery, service agreement, or payment plan, such
as in the following:
 “Will payment be through VISA, MasterCard, or American
Express?”
 “Do you want to meet Wednesday or Thursday this week?”
 “Would you like your free gift to be the potato peeler or the
apple corer?”
Offering an alternative is one of my favorite closes: It’s simple, it
works, and it’s made me millions of dollars in sales. This versatile
technique works at every stage of the process — you can use it for
qualifying, trial closes, and presentations.
When using this close, don’t offer too many choices. Limit the
options you offer to three — two is preferable. If you give a
prospect ten options, for example, he may spend too much time
thinking about which to pick, or he may attempt to hybridize the
possibilities and create an option you can’t deliver.
Chapter 14: Orchestrating a Successful Close 185

Don’t be too concerned about coming up with options you’re
certain the client wants. Pairing up the likely choice with a sure
loser may even move along the close process more effectively than
if the prospect has to think about it. For example, I’ve discovered
that this strategy is very effective with children. My 5-year-old son,
Wesley, loves choices. When I want something done, I give him a
choice between doing what I need done or a consequence he won’t
want: “Do you want to clean your room or not ride your bicycle for
the rest of the day?” or “Which would you prefer? To help clear the
dishes off the table or not watch a DVD before you go to bed?”
Inevitably, he chooses the task that needs to be accomplished.
Making an assumption
Although the prospect hasn’t yet said, “I’ll take it — I’m ready to
sign and write the check,” your assumptive close statement ever-so-
subtly suggests that the sale is imminent and helps make the buyer
more comfortable with that outcome. Assumptive closes are often
verbal (you are in telephone sales, right?); here are some examples
of assumptive closes:
 “Are you looking to put your in-ground pool in the southern
corner of your lot?”
 “Will you use your hybrid for daily commuting as well as your
long-distance trips?”
Note that I refer to the product as “yours.” I’ve already given own-
ership of the item, making it all the easier for the client to imagine
having it.
If you’re closing face to face, you can also deliver a nonverbal
assumptive close. Taking notes on a formal document can be very
effective in reinforcing the client’s acceptance of the sale. As you ask
questions and gather information, you can begin filling in the agree-
ment form or the sales order. If the client expresses hesitation, you
can explain why you are doing what you are doing. You can easily
make the following script work for you:
“I want to take notes to make sure I have everything you want
down correctly, so there isn’t anything that is missed. Is that
alright with you?”
I would suggest that, even if the final sale comes over the phone
rather than face to face, you make notes on the contract, as well.
That way, you keep the notes all in one spot, and then you also
have built-in trial closes with any agreements in terms of delivery
dates, execution dates, specifics of what they’re receiving, who the
parties are in the agreement, and so on. You can find numerous
ways to engage and close on the prospect.

Part IV: Going for the Close 
186

Another way you can use the assumptive close: You can soften an
assumptive close with opening phrases and even link an assumptive
close with an alternative of choice close (see the preceding section);
check out the following examples:
 “This is not meant to rush you. If everything we have reviewed
thus far makes sense, how soon do you want delivery of the
new copier?”
 “Not to be assumptive, but if everything we have discussed so
far is on target, would you want the 8400 model or 9400 model?”
Taking a test drive
The test-drive close is a cousin to the puppy-dog close — most
often used on the domestic front: “I just knew you’d love him after
you saw him playing with the kids. But, honestly, honey, if you
don’t think we can take care of a dog, we can take him back to the
pound.” You know darn well that puppy’s here to stay.
The test-drive close, however, comes with a guarantee: a full refund
if the prospect isn’t 100-percent satisfied. When your prospect
expresses a clear desire for the product but hasn’t yet committed,
offer him a test drive. Check out the following script:
“Mr. Jones, why not give the 8600 model a try? If you are not
delighted, you can call me personally, and I will handle your
return and refund. Can you get a pen and paper? My name is Bob
Smith, and my phone number is 555-1234.”
At any stage of the sales process, your personal guarantee is one
powerful tool. When employed with the test-drive close, you and
your prospect have little to lose — and lots to gain.
Going with a sharp angle
The sharp-angle close is one you use only in rare situations, but it
can be highly effective. With the sharp angle close, you put the
prospect in an “if” situation. Pull this one out of your arsenal when
the prospect throws a conditional commitment at you. For exam-
ple, the client states that she would buy if only you could deliver
by next week. Now, this type of request may be a stall tactic — she
may be tossing it out because she thinks it’s an impossible request.
But if you can meet her demand, you’d be surprised how often
these situations turn into sales.
Chapter 14: Orchestrating a Successful Close 187

Check out the following conditional commitment and response
from the salesperson:
Prospect: “If I decide to buy long-distance service, I’d need it
switched by the end of the month.”
Salesperson: “If I can guarantee that we can switch you before
the end of the month, are you prepared to do business
together?”
If you don’t know whether you can perform by the specified date,
you can use this type of response:
Salesperson: “If I could guarantee that we can switch your
service by the end of the month, and I am not certain we can
without confirmation from servicing, are you prepared to move
forward with our agreement?”
Strengthening the Sale: The
Follow-up after the Close
You did it! From first call to final agreement, you got the sale —
adding another victory to this month’s sales goals. All that hard work
paid off and now you’re ready to take some well-deserved R&R.
But before you adjust the lounge chair and add the mint to your
julep, you have a little more work to do. Sure, you got the client’s
commitment, but the curtain hasn’t fallen on this act yet. Plenty of
things could still happen to unravel all your efforts. By taking a few
measures to shore up the deal, you reduce that risk.
Your follow-up steps offer another benefit: You set the stage for a
long-running show with this customer. By strengthening this partic-
ular sale, you can look forward to more sales and even an ongoing
stream of business referrals. This section can help you fortify your
relationship with this prospect and ensure the buyer doesn’t back
out from the sale.
Insuring against buyer’s remorse
Buyer’s remorse is a fact of life. It’s the feeling of the buyer questioning
what he just bought. You’ve experienced it yourself — and if you’re
like most people, the higher the price tag, the harder the punch.
“What have I done?” “How can I get out of this?” “I made a big mis-
take!” “I should have said no.” Adding fuel to the fire are friends,
coworkers, bosses, spouses: “You did what?”
Part IV: Going for the Close 
188

Buyer’s remorse can set in the minute the ink is dry on the order —
or build over time as the customer second guesses his decision. A
top salesperson takes immediate action to counter the insidious
effects of buyer’s remorse. To insure against buyer’s remorse, the
following can help.
Affirming the purchase
After you complete the sale, the first thing you may want to do is
turn in the order. Get it up on the big board to advertise your suc-
cess. Line up for your commission check. But hold off until you’ve
completed the most important task: affirming the purchase.
Reassure your new client by congratulating him on his wise deci-
sion. For example:
“Bob, I want you to know that you made a great decision in
buying the 8600 model. It’s exactly what your company needed to
increase the productivity of the staff and improve the quality of
your reports to your clients.”
Be sure to insert some of the benefits that were most important to
him when you were discussing the sale. Remind the purchaser of
the key reasons he made this decision. When a “you-did-what?”
person challenges him later, he’ll appreciate the refresher from you.
Saying the magic word
Before you turn in the sale, you don’t want to overlook the most
fundamental courtesy — saying thank you for the customer’s busi-
ness. You can keep it simple, such as the following thank you:
“Bob, I know that there are other options available to you
besides our cable television service. I want to thank you for
selecting us to provide that service to you. It was my pleasure to
help you.”
Some of you are in highly competitive sales arenas in which the
consumer has many choices. Recognizing this and expressing your
appreciation for the business reassures your new client that he
made the right choice. For example, on virtually every flight I take,
the flight attendant thanks the passengers for choosing the airline
and acknowledges that they could have chosen another carrier to
fly to their destination. Salespeople should remember that this
practice applies to their industry, too.
Staying in touch
Although few salespeople keep in regular contact with their clients
after the commission check has been cut, your efforts to do so
Chapter 14: Orchestrating a Successful Close 189

promise to set you apart from the others. When you consider how
much you invested into the relationship to earn the client’s busi-
ness, nurturing that connection only makes sense, and maintaining
your relationship means locking in that client for life. Staying in con-
tact doesn’t take much: Occasional check-in calls, updates about
enhancements or new services, or even birthday acknowledgments
don’t demand much more than dropping a card in the mail.
Schedule it
While the sale is fresh in your mind, you won’t have much difficulty
remembering to call the client to confirm on-time delivery and
complete satisfaction with the product. But once that success is a
distant memory, you may find the stretches between contacts gets
longer and longer.
Don’t let that happen: Schedule those regular follow-up calls,
whether once a month or four times a year. Plug them into your
calendar just like you do the weekly meetings with your boss.
Stay ahead of the game: “Thinking of you”
If you feel like you don’t have a good reason to call — no new prod-
ucts to sell, no updates or enhancements — look at providing your
clients with added value based on their interests. Keep in touch with
your clients to show you’re aware of their interests and thinking of
them. Doing so shows professionalism.
For example, say your customer is an avid golfer. You may want to
procure some passes to a prestigious course, tickets to a popular
golf tournament, or a subscription to a golf magazine. The fact that
you’re doing this post-sale carries a lot of weight and certainly
ensures that she’ll remember you.
You can also stay on top of developments in her industry: forward
articles of interest, send congratulations on positive company
press or awards, or serve as “corporate intelligence” and report
news about competition (as long as the competition isn’t a client,
too!). These efforts send the message that you’re thinking of your
client and always looking out for her interests.
Be sure to include in your mailing your latest catalogue of products
or a new product brochure. They’re more likely to get noticed in
this added-value mailing than if you’d sent them solo.

Don’t Land the Sale

 Steering clear of no-sale failure
R
ejection comes with the sales territory — even for the best
salespeople. But dynamite salespeople don’t equate the loss
of a sale with failure. Just because you don’t land the sale doesn’t
mean you’ve lost the prospect forever. In fact, dealing with the
emotional whammy is one of the most critical factors in getting
past sales rejection.
My best advice is to let go of attachment to the outcome. The more
time and effort you invest in the prospect, the more devastating
the rejection may feel. Getting over a hang-up on your initial sales
call is easier than putting in weeks of work and hearing a “no” at
the eleventh hour. I’m not suggesting that you cut and run if you
don’t tie up the sale in short order or that you refuse to give the
effort your 110 percent, however lengthy the process. But be aware
that the emotional gut punch could be more powerful — so be
prepared to repeat the mantra, “Let go of attachment to outcome.”
By following this approach and staying “in the moment” through-
out the process, you’re more likely to stick to the right steps —
preparing and giving a dynamic presentation, overcoming objections,
and effectively closing — that bring success. And if you don’t make
this particular sale, well, you’ll know that you did your best. You’re
in it for the long haul. So the next time you hear “no” from a prospect,
tap into your inner wisdom, accept the outcome with grace, and
move forward. In this chapter, I share tactics for conceding gra-
ciously and retaining connection — which increase the likelihood
that this loss will lead to success down the road.

Part IV: Going for the Close 
192
Sticking to the Seven-Step
Recovery Program
When you lose the sale, the first steps you take can help you con-
clude the process with professionalism and dignity. By adhering to
the seven steps to closure in this section, you also build bridges
for an ongoing relationship and increase opportunities for future
business, as well.
Step one: Gather information
Even in the face of defeat, valuable information could lead to further
sales opportunities. Although rejection often feels personal, in most
cases it isn’t. The prospect has specific business reasons why he
made a particular choice. The more you understand what led to
that decision, the better prepared you’ll be to sell successfully in
the future. Most prospects recognize and appreciate your efforts
and are happy to answer your questions regarding their decisions.
(Truth is, they may feel bad about saying no — this gives them an
opportunity to assuage some of that guilt!)
Ask permission to pose a few questions, explaining that you want
to do a better job in the future. The more information you gather
about your performance, your company’s performance, your
products and services, the prospect’s decision-making process,
and the company’s future needs, the more likely you’ll parlay this
“failure” into future success.
Here are some questions that may result in insightful answers:
“Where did we fall short in securing your business?”
“Did I say or do anything that influenced the sale away from our
company?”
“If you were me, what would you have done differently?”
“Do you see an opportunity where we might work together again
in the future? What would that be?”
“Is there anything else that I can do for you?”
“May I contact you in a few months just to touch base and see
how the solution you chose has worked out?”

Chapter 15: Moving Forward When You Don't Land the Sale 193
Step two: Express your disappointment
In an effort to remain upbeat in the face of rejection, salespeople
may risk coming off a little too glib. A too-cheerful acceptance may
translate as, “No big deal”; “I wasn’t really expecting to get the
sale”; or “Your business is not that important to me.”
You don’t want to leave this message behind. A sincere, clear expres-
sion of disappointment, on the other hand, can communicate that
the prospect is, indeed, important. This doesn’t mean whining or
pouting or attempting to lay guilt. When done properly, your decla-
ration communicates an admirable level of caring and commitment.
After listening carefully to the prospect’s explanation, try a
response along these lines:
“Well, I must confess I’m disappointed to lose your business. I
believe we can meet your objectives and exceed your expecta-
tions. I respect your decision and wish you the best success. And
if you find that your circumstances change and you need services
such as ours, I look forward to any opportunities to serve you.”
Step three: If you can’t say 
anything nice . . .
Later in this chapter in the “Avoiding the Three No-Sale Sins” sec-
tion, I advise you to squelch the urge to badmouth the prospect’s
choice. In fact, at this stage, don’t make any negative remarks,
whether a slam at the prospect’s judgment, a criticism of the
values of her company, or a crack at the competition.
More importantly, seek out some positive things to say. I know,
easier said than done, especially if you have strong conviction
about your product or service — as you should. But you can find
plenty of ways you can compliment without compromising. For
example:
“I appreciate how much thought and effort you’ve put into your
exploration process and know you’ve made this decision after
careful consideration.”
“This process has made it clear to me how committed your
company is to its values and convictions. I know that any company
would be proud to earn your business.”

By saying something nice, you avoid the natural tendency to go
negative when you hear bad news. You also avoid your reaction to
begin the sales pitch all over again. You also position yourself as a
professional with integrity.
Step four: Before hanging up, 
open a window
As a telephone salesperson, you’re always in the process of preparing
for the future — and that doesn’t stop when you’re coming off a no
sale. The future is always brighter when you open a window. Opening
a window simply means giving yourself a future opportunity to make
a sale. As you wind down your conversation with the prospect,
take these steps to keep the window open:
 Ask permission to check back in a few weeks. By doing so,
you may discover that the prospect is now dissatisfied and
looking for a new provider.
 Ask to contact the prospect periodically. “Can I call you in a
month just to see how you are doing?” The larger the account,
the more frequently you want to be in touch.
In most cases, the call back should happen between 30 days
and three months. That timeframe is soon enough that the
prospect hasn’t forgotten you, but far enough out that you’re
not a pest.
 Encourage the prospect to call you any time. “If I can be of
assistance to you in the future, please don’t hesitate to call.”
Doing so shows that you’re available to be of service.
Step five: Send a personal note
Thank-you notes aren’t appropriate only for wedding presents and
job interviews. Send a handwritten personal note to the prospect
that got away, and I guarantee that she’ll remember your name (as
well as the fact that the salesperson who got the business didn’t
send one). This most-effective technique evokes professionalism
and courtesy.
You don’t have to say much. Simply express your appreciation for
the opportunity to vie for their business. Mention your regret that
you didn’t land the business, and close with a promise to stay in
touch in hopes that you may serve them in the future.
Part IV: Going for the Close 
194

Step six: Deliver added value
Just because you didn’t get the business doesn’t mean you don’t
have as important a relationship with this prospect as you do with
your clients. Treat your no-sale “clients” with the same attention
you give the others —differentiate yourself from your competition
and, likely, the company your prospects are currently using.
Recycle some of that knowledge you gathered during the sales
process and put it to work providing added value. For example,
forward articles of personal or professional interest. Recommend
books or seminars. Alert prospects to relevant resources, products,
and services. By showing the prospect an extra value, she may
consider your business in the future.
Step seven: Just do it!
If, during your final communication with the prospect, you commit-
ted to doing something — whether calling, mailing an article, or
forwarding information on a new product — make sure you do it!
Following up and sticking to your word communicates that the
prospect is as important as any other client.
Blowing off this sort of commitment is easy — you didn’t land the
business, so why go to the trouble? You’re busy enough serving
those folks who are paying your commissions, right? However,
don’t downplay the importance of this person.
Your no-sale prospects are highly qualified prospects. After all, you
made it to the final round before you got the gong. So your invest-
ment in them is likely to offer a high return. If you’re a good sport
and don’t go off and pout, when this prospect needs this service or
product again, he’ll remember how you followed through.
Finding Follow-Up Openings
When you view your lost prospects as future clients, you can see
the value in maintaining a relationship with them. But challenges
come along with the package. For one thing, because you aren’t
doing business with them in the present, you have fewer opportu-
nities to make contact and build your relationship.
So your challenge is to seek out follow-up openings. It may take a
bit of effort, but the opportunities certainly exist. Following are
three arenas to explore — my advice is to go for a mixed-use plan
that calls on all three.
Chapter 15: Moving Forward When You Don't Land the Sale 195

Checking in with a service checkup
If the prospect said yes when you asked permission to follow up
from time to time, you have the perfect opportunity. A service
checkup allows you to take a reading on how satisfied the prospect
is with his service and whether he has any new needs. Basically,
you want the answers to these three questions:
 “How is the purchase of your competitors product or service
performing?”
 “Are you getting exactly what you need and expected?”
 “Is there anything I can do for you?”
You’d be surprised at how much business these checkups can
garner when you call on a regular basis. Make the commitment to
call with a service checkup at least every quarter.
Keeping current with new products
Although your primary objective is to open the door and make a
sale, a number of secondary benefits are uncovered — even if you
don’t land the sale. Chances are, your company rolls out new prod-
ucts or services periodically — providing a perfect excuse for con-
tacting former prospects.
Updating them about your firm’s new offerings may permit a peek
at how the competition is performing. You’re also demonstrating
that your company is effective at bringing new products and serv-
ices to the marketplace. By partnering with you, the prospects
assure themselves a spot on the cutting edge.
Even if the prospect isn’t in the market for one of your products,
she still may like your product. If so, you can also ask for referrals:
Does she know anyone within her company or industry who may
benefit from your new product or service? Getting these names can
provide more prospects.
Extending a social invitation
Even if your newest products aren’t pertinent to the prospect’s needs,
or your service checkup turns up no opportunities (see the preceding
sections on these topics), the social engagement is always a means
to renew a connection. If you collected any information on a
prospect’s personal interests, you can use this knowledge to create
an opportunity. For example, ask that Thai-food fan to lunch at the
Part IV: Going for the Close 
196

new Thai restaurant. Invite the former college athlete-turned-business
executive to a ballgame. Let the theater-buff purchasing manager
know you have two extra tickets to the city’s hottest new production.
This strategy is especially effective if you’re selling personal 
professional services — real estate, insurance, financial planning,
and so forth. Make sure the account value is large enough to war-
rant this additional investment of time. You wouldn’t want to do
this if you were selling $100 widgets — unless the prospect could
buy thousands of them.
Avoiding the Three No-Sale Sins
Despite efforts to move on from “no” with your positive attitude
intact, the sting of rejection often triggers a less-than-positive
response. Awareness goes a long way in helping you avoid these
three knee-jerk reactions to rejection.
The last thing you want to do is to retaliate or burn any bridges
when you get a no answer. The best response is to stay profes-
sional and thank the prospect for his time. You also want to avoid
doing any of the following no-sale no-nos.
Hitting instant replay
When you get a no answer, the very last thing you want to do is try
the sales pitch all over again. When you do, all the prospect hears
is “You’d have to be a total idiot to say no to my proposal, so I’ll
give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just didn’t hear
my presentation. Let me start from the beginning.” Attempts to
save the game with a Hail Mary pass are pretty transparent.
This approach shows little respect for the prospect or the sales
process. It smacks of desperation and a self-focused obsession
on commission. You’re better off keeping your mouth closed
and listening respectfully. This way, you not only avoid turning
off the prospect, but you may also learn valuable information
that could help you regain the client at some point. You may be
able to use this valuable information to find a solution that
would get the prospect to say yes.
Switching to deep-freeze mode
Silence is golden, but the silent treatment can tarnish your profes-
sional image. When the prospect gives you a no answer, you don’t
Chapter 15: Moving Forward When You Don't Land the Sale 197

want to give the silent treatment. I’ve seen a lot of salespeople —
in an attempt not to express disappointment or frustration —
suddenly cool toward the client and clam up. The silence is often
preceded with a tight-lipped “Fine.”
More than 20 years in sales have exposed me to countless instances
of the deep-freeze treatment. But in truth, 18 years of marriage have
taught me the real meaning of “Fine.” When my wife, Joan, uses that
word, I can assure you that whatever I said or didn’t say — did or
didn’t do — is most certainly not “fine.” It’s a signal for me to take
immediate action to make amends for whatever I said — or didn’t say.
No doubt, your prospects have the same clear reading of the word
fine. But unlike me — a model husband — they will take immediate
steps to divorce themselves from the situation. You’re better off to
express your disappointment in a calm and respectful manner than
freeze your prospects with the silent treatment.
Knocking the competition
In a last-ditch effort to save the sale, desperate salespeople often
turn to bashing the company or service the prospect has chosen.
Sure, you know all sorts of sordid details about this company —
it’s in the best interest of the prospect to let him or her know
exactly what they’re getting into. Certainly, after they have this
insight, they’ll switch to a company they can trust — yours, right?
Don’t count on it. Although you may be successful in spoiling the
sale for your competitor, you’re likely to damage your own reputa-
tion. Most people know sour grapes when they see ’em.
But what’s the worst damage done? When you knock the company
your prospect has chosen to work with, you convey that you don’t
think she’s competent to make a good business decision. And who
wants to work with someone who thinks they’re incompetent?

nside every successful telephone salesperson is a
human behavioral expert — an individual who can
size up a prospect quickly and know exactly how to best
communicate. This part gives you the tools you need to
analyze your clients’ behaviors and to understand and
maximize your own unique sales style.
In Chapter 16, I help you discover your selling style and
how to better utilize your natural gifts to increase sales. In
Chapter 17, I demonstrate how to zero in quickly — within
minutes — on your prospect’s behavioral style through
the tone and strength of voice, inﬂection, and even word
selection in order to build trust faster, communicate more
effectively, and sell in less time. Lastly, in Chapter 18, I tell
you how to harness your emotions, maintain an optimistic
attitude, and wield the self-discipline necessary to stay on
the path to success. You hear athletes talk about being “in
the zone,” a place where all the shots drop and putts sink
with little effort. Well, salespeople can get into the zone,
too — and I show you how in this part.

In This Chapter
 Eyeing the DISC behavioral model
 Identifying your behavioral style
U
nderstanding behavioral style can dramatically improve all
your personal interactions, whether you’re talking to your
father or son, your friends, or business customers. The good news is
that you don’t have to be a doctor of psychology to master behavioral
selling. You just need to know something about the DISC profile,
which classifies behavioral styles into quadrants and helps you
identify individual styles and how to communicate most effectively
for that style. Equally important, DISC can help you identify and
optimize your own behavioral style.
Sound complicated? It isn’t. This chapter walks you through the
nuts and bolts of DISC, helps you identify your behavioral style, and
shares the importance of adapting your style to increase your sales.
Getting the Lowdown on DISC
Everyone reacts differently to any given situation: Say you’re in a
meeting to hear the bad news that your company earnings are down.
If I were there, I might demand facts, numbers, and possibly hurt
some people’s feelings by my direct approach to finding the source
of the problem. You might launch into a pep talk, pat the others on
the back, and assure everyone that this is just a hiccup. Another
attendee might latch onto a finance report, poring over every detail
and attempting varying analyses. And someone else may simply sit
calmly, taking in the responses of the others before speaking up.
These are examples of varying responses, defined within a behav-
ioral model known as the DISC model. According to the DISC theory,
a widely followed behavioral model — adopted and modified by

Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
202
numerous behavioral-modeling programs — each person exhibits
one or more of the following behaviors in varying degrees:
 Dominant
 Influencer
 Steady
 Compliant
These four factors blended together create the make-up of your
behavioral style.
Before diving deeper into DISC, you must rid yourself of two ideas
before you make any wrong assumptions about people:
 No behavioral style is better than another. In truth, each
style carries with it strengths and weaknesses, opportunities
and challenges. In sales, some styles have a higher probability
of achieving success, but each one — given the right product
line, willingness to perfect sales skills, and commitment —
can achieve success.
 Most people exhibit a combination of behavioral styles, with
one or even two commanding the mix (called primary
behavioral styles). Very few people — less than 4 percent —
score high in only one style.
Was Wonder Woman a Dominant?
Humankind has been struggling to understand what makes people tick since the
earliest times. And, since those earliest times, it seems that people have been divid-
ing everything up into fours: Nearly 2,500 years ago, Greek philosopher Empedocles
proclaimed that each personality is influenced by fire, water, earth, or air. His con-
temporary, Hippocrates, identified four temperaments: sanguine, melancholic, chol-
eric, and phlegmatic.
In 1928, Harvard doctoral graduate Dr. William Moulton Marston published his land-
mark book, The Emotions of Normal People. In it, he established the DISC model,
identifying four behavioral types: dominant, influencing, steady, and compliant. (Lest
you assume Marston was a stuffy old academic, know that in addition to inventing
an early lie detector, he’s also the co-originator of the Wonder Woman comic strip.)
Today, many behavioralists adhere to the DISC model or some variation of it —
incorporating colorful foursomes from panthers, dolphins, peacocks, and owls, to
guardians, idealists, artisans, and scientists.

Chapter 16: Exploding Your Earnings through Behavioral Selling 203
A person’s primary behavioral style is the style with the highest
score when using an assessment instrument. It’s the style that is
most notable especially in pressure situations. The secondary style
is another of the DISC factors that is a high score but not the high-
est score. It influences behavior to a lesser degree.
I dissect each behavioral style in the following section in this chap-
ter for a better understanding of the DISC theory. I then help you
figure out your style and how to use it to your advantage in the
sales arena in the section “Figuring Out Your DISC Style.”
D Is for Dominant
The Dominant person — in some DISC systems referred to as a
driver panther, organizer, guardian, or economist — exhibits the
characteristics that many perceive to be those of a leader. The
High D is often described as:
 Aggressive
 Decisive
 Bold
 Demanding
 Competitive
 Direct
 Confident
 Results focused
 Controlling
 Risk oriented
I bet you’re thinking that most of these characteristics describe a
successful salesperson. And, indeed, they often do. These folks are
invigorated by challenge and the feeling of accomplishment. This
section provides a bit more about the Dominant.
What makes the Dominant tick?
Dominants are bottom-line oriented. They thrive when they have a
clear, tangible goal, and they’re in it — whether we’re talking
sports, stardom, or sales — to win. You find a lot of Ds in the
sports world. Vince Lombardi’s famous quote of “Winning isn’t
everything; it’s the only thing” sums up life’s philosophy for a High
Dominant person. Dominants also love a challenge and are enthusi-
astic when the challenge results in an “est” reward: the highest
salary, the biggest corner office, and so on.
I remember watching a 60 Minutes interview a few years ago: Co-
host Ed Bradley asked golf mega-star Tiger Woods, “If we played
ping pong, would you want to beat me?” Woods responded, “No, I
would want to kick your butt!” Then, Mr. Bradley said, “What if I
won?” Tiger’s response was classic High D: “We would play again
until I won.”

How does a D operate?
A Dominant thrives on results (see preceding section), but how
does that play out in her life? Dominants are
 Self-motivated, with a need to direct and control all situations
that have an impact on them. They can prefer to work alone
rather than serve as part of a team. And if they’re part of the
team, they prefer to be the leader.
 Focused on the destination, working hard to achieve their
goals and eliminating steps they consider unimportant. If
you’ve ever said, “Don’t ask how I achieved it; only notice that
I did it,” your core behavioral style is most likely that of a
Dominant. (To find out more concretely, check out the section
“Figuring Out Your DISC style,” later in this chapter.)
 Direct. Some would call them forthright, straightforward, or
to the point; others would describe them as curt or brusque.
 Willing to work long and hard to make their plans happen.
People with a D behavioral style get to the office early, stay
late, and pay almost any price necessary to achieve the suc-
cess that they desire.
 Quick, and expect others they work with to be as quick.
Your D boss wants to know your numbers; she’s impatient
when you attempt to explain the hows and whys.
What’s the downside to Ds?
Fast-thinking, fast-talking, and fast-acting, Dominants can easily
overpower or intimidate others. Dominants are by nature direct,
aggressive, and to the point. Desire for immediate reward means
that most Dominants prefer short sales cycles. When aggravated
by stress, the High D can come across as egotistical, arrogant, too
fast, not caring, out for the sale, a poor listener, and pressuring.
Dominants also tend to get bored easily and need the constant
stimulation of a worthy challenge. A High-D salesperson often
moves from company to company in order to seek out new chal-
lenges. In their efforts to control all factors that affect their suc-
cess, Dominants often attempt to control other people as well,
which can cause discord within a company. The good news is that
when the battle’s over, it’s over. No grudges, no rehashing. For a
Dominant, it’s water under the bridge.
The High D has a primary fear of being taken advantage of. A High
D must be convinced that he’s getting a fair shake or a good deal
before he’s comfortable moving ahead. A High D also needs the
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
204

straight story upfront. He’s the type who walks into a car dealership
and says, “Give me your best price.” If he discovers that they didn’t
give it to him at the get-go, he walks out. The High Ds blind spot?
His short fuse often has him exploding in anger. The fireworks go
off, with little consideration for the aftermath, and sometimes he’s
surprised when others seem cold after one of his outbursts.
I Is for Influencer
As the name implies, Influencers or Expressives are recognized for
their contagious energy and enthusiasm, which can inspire others
to action. Influencers typically make strong salespeople with char-
acteristics that match the demands of the job. An Influencer may
exhibit some of these qualities:
 Communicative
 Gregarious
 Emotional
 Optimistic
 Entertaining
 Personable
 Enthusiastic
 Persuasive
 Expressive
 Popular
When you channel the gift of gab, high energy, and powers of per-
suasion into a telephone-sales professional, you’re reckoning with
a powerful force. The Influencer makes things happen! Keep read-
ing to find out more about the Influencer behavioral style.
Knowing what drives the I
Influencers are people people. They enjoy working with groups as
well as having one-on-one interactions. Influencers like a lot of
attention, so in group dynamics, they tend to wind up angling for
the spotlight. Being liked, being popular, and being recognized rank
high with the I.
Optimism and can-do certainty make Influencers comfortable with
the often high-pressure demands of a sales career. Their
unbounded enthusiasm and desire for personal glory helps them
reach sales achievements — especially if it earns them a gold
plaque on the wall for all to see.
High Is are also drawn to the newest, cutting-edge, trendiest, most-
exclusive products, services, and experiences available. They feel
it’s part of their image and that it affects the way others see them.
A High I wants to be recognized by other people for her purchase
or sound decision.
Chapter 16: Exploding Your Earnings through Behavioral Selling 205

Spotting an Influencer in action
An I is the easiest of the four behavioral types to identify. Even in
the midst of a crowd, look for the most colorful, most vocal, most
expressive of the flock, and you’ve found your I. Influencer’s com-
mand of language and strong verbal skills turn to his advantage in
situations in which he must be persuasive. High Is are extremely
social and personable; no surprise, then, that they excel at rela-
tionship selling.
One on one, Influencers exude the same amount of energy and
optimism. They connect and build a high level of trust in others
quickly and easily. In presentation mode, they bring energy, pas-
sion, connection, and trust. Influencers relish the presentation
stage, and because of their remarkable verbal skills and personal
demeanor, they excel at convincing even the most skeptical
prospects.
For example, in your mind, replay some of the times you saw
President Clinton on television. He’s certainly the classic High
Influencer. I don’t think there has been as effective, friendly,
persuasive, optimistic, and verbally persuasive of a politician in my
lifetime.
Recognizing too much 
of a good thing
High Influencers can be bigger than life and sometimes overwhelming.
Under fire, a High I can appear scattered, showy, lacking substance,
out of touch, verbose, too familiar, self-promoting, and unrealistic.
High Influencers are also often highly emotional. Feelings and
emotions can influence their actions heavily — often to the detri-
ment of objective clarity. Focusing on the details — filling in the
paperwork and adding up the numbers — just doesn’t add up to a
priority for an I. In fact, a High I may neglect most activities that
don’t involve social interaction or “fun.”
Influencers tend to be trusting to a fault. They give their trust 
to people easily with out checking all the facts. Influencers as
salespeople often trust that the prospect will do what they say they
will do. They often count on sales that never come to fruition. In a
sales situation, this trusting nature may put them at risk for major
letdown when a sale fails to materialize as promised.
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
206

S Is for Steady
The Steady behavioral style is also known as a relater or amiable in
some models. A Steady is rarely described as a high-pressure sales-
person, but instead, sells on these other qualities:
 Good listener
 Predictable
 Harmonious
 Reliable
 Loyal
 Service oriented
 Patient
 Sincere
 Persistent
 Team oriented
Easy-going, laid-back, and low-pressure describe the sales style of
the Steady, a style that often seems at odds with the traditional
stereotype of the typical sales personality. For more on the Steady,
keep reading.
Pinpointing what gets 
a Steady going
Steadies live to serve. They’re driven to please and meet the needs
of their clients and prospects first. They’re extremely loyal to the
people around them and are always willing to give help and sup-
port. An environment of collaboration and cooperation is the most
comfortable place for the S.
The High S develops deep, long-term sales relationships, retaining
clients for years and decades. The Steady is outstanding at
maintaining, servicing, and expanding established accounts. High
Steadies desire completion more than competition. They want to
finish what they start and take a client through each step or stage of
the sales process for their own fulfillment, as well as for the client’s.
Distinguishing a Steady
If you want to see a Steady, look for the Energizer Bunny. This type
sticks to the established sales strategy and cycle and keeps going
and going and going. The predictable Steady sticks to the program,
especially under fire.
Spotting High Steadies can sometimes be hard. They’re behind-the-
scenes operators, steering clear of center stage and opportunities
for attention. That doesn’t mean Steadies don’t like working with
Chapter 16: Exploding Your Earnings through Behavioral Selling 207

people — in fact, they’re very sociable, but in more of a what-can-I-
do-for-you way, rather than a look-at-me way. Steadies treasure
long-standing relationships and work hard to maintain them.
A High Steady is the type that sticks with her hairdresser of ten
years — even though she’s less than dazzled with her recent hair-
cuts. The High S possesses unlimited amounts of patience for the
sales process, feeling out clients’ needs, wants, concerns, and hesi-
tations. Although not dramatically emotive like the High Influencer,
the Steady is empathetic and exudes a caring attitude.
Steady challenges
Although patience is a virtue, sometimes Steadies are steadfast to
a fault, letting the sales process languish well past its productivity.
Their lack of self-focus often translates to lack of self-confidence,
and their discomfort with sudden change can paralyze them in
times of upheaval.
The nature of the Steady is to proceed with caution when pressure
increases. Steady salespeople are likely to contain their emotions
and react slowly to a threat. They’re uncomfortable with closing,
especially if they sense any resistance, and will all-too-quickly
hand over all control of the situation to the prospect. A High
Steady in extreme can be viewed as uncaring, uncreative, slow to
act, unable to change, afraid, inflexible, hesitant, and unconcerned.
The High Steady craves harmony in all interactions. She wants
everyone to get along, work together, and talk it out. If a High S
senses friction, her inclination is to flee. But to those she’s con-
nected with, a High S is a loyalist. Despite their strong commit-
ments, High Steadies can come across as disengaged or uncaring
because they tend not to express their emotions, and people may
have a hard time reading them.
C Is for Compliant
The Compliant, also referred to as rational or analytical in other
behavioral models, yearns more than any other type for quality and
perfection. The High C doesn’t match the traditional description of a
successful salesperson, but many C qualities have a place in the
sales world:
 Detailed
 Precise
 Diplomatic
 Process oriented
 Exacting
 Reserved
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
208

 Intrinsically
 Structured
motivated
 Logic driven
 Thorough
Compliants’ selling is fact oriented rather than emotional. They
may be successful in commercial real estate, for example, where
capitalization rates, cash flow, and other calculations and formulas
determine sales success. In this world, investors are more numbers
oriented in their decision making and they appreciate the strengths
of a Compliant salesperson. Want to know more about what gets a
Compliant going, how to identify one, and some of the pitfalls of
being a High C? The following sections have your answers.
What puts a High C into high gear?
High Compliants aren’t motivated by contests, recognition, rewards,
and other incentives. They’re there to compete with themselves
based on the standard they’ve committed to meet — whether it’s
the company mission or the current quarter earnings goals. For High
Cs, the focus is on the process and on achieving accurate and high-
quality results — not on winning awards.
In any endeavor, having a clear grasp of all the details is important
to a High C. For example, a High C wouldn’t buy a new plasma TV
until he’s researched all the features and comparison-shopped with
every store in town and on the Internet — even if it takes months.
High Cs thrive when they clearly understand the expectations and
are given the time and resources to achieve accuracy and quality
in their outcomes. They don’t demand the sort of control that a
Dominant does, but they crave control over the factors that affect
their results.
How does a High C act?
Compliants, like Steadies, often fly under the radar. They can 
be quiet, reserved, and — although they’re agreeable to team 
situations — often found working alone. Compliants are meticulous
planners. The High-C salesperson painstakingly prepares for calls,
questions, auxiliary information, and objections before picking up
the phone. They’re polite and courteous in their approach. For a
sales manager, Compliants provide the fewest problems in regard
to following the rules, procedures, and paperwork.
High Cs need to follow the process and be clear on their objec-
tives. Naturally reserved and painstakingly thorough, they become
more so under pressure, especially if they’re being pressured to
Chapter 16: Exploding Your Earnings through Behavioral Selling 209

make a sudden change or break with the plan in any way. Under
these circumstances, they turn to the procedures and carefully
review the facts, the data, and the situation. High Compliants seek
absolute accuracy. They often fear making the wrong decision and
assess every situation thoroughly. High Cs often let their exacting
nature lead to fear — a fear that they’ll make a bad decision.
When Compliants turn uncompliant
Considering their moniker, Compliants can be the most difficult, con-
trary, and uncompliant of the four types. In fact, these High Cs are
actually in compliance to a higher standard — one of thoroughness
and accuracy at all costs. If they’re pressed to compromise in a way
that betrays these standards, they can become just plain belligerent.
Compliants, like Steadies, can be resistant to change and slow to
adapt, especially from what they believe to be the right process or
system. At their worst, High Compliants are viewed as perfectionists,
unyielding to change, overly questioning, too sensitive, slow moving,
nitpicky, pessimistic, and not focused enough on the results.

210
Watch out for Dominant Dirk
I’m naturally a High Dominant, and in a perfect world, I would prefer to engage in
all situations in a High Dominant fashion. I like to give short, hard-hitting, direct, fast-
paced, assertive presentations to prospects I’ve carefully qualified so I don’t waste
time. I also like to use assertive trial closes and straightforward objection handling
(see Chapters 13 and 14 for more on these topics) that culminate in strong 
conviction-based closes.
That sales style works like a charm for me — as long as I’m talking to another
Dominant. The High D loves that straight-to-the-point, just-the-results-ma’am, no-
beating-around-the-bush approach. But for the 82 percent of the population who
aren’t Dominant, my communication style is likely to hit them like a category-5
Hurricane Dirk and push them into battening down the hatches or getting out of
town when they know I’m coming.
If I want to reach my sales goals, I have to either limit my market to the 18 percent
High Ds, or I must figure out how to adapt my selling style to reach the other 82 per-
cent of the potential prospects in the world. If I limit my selling to Dominants (which
would not be wise), I would need to dramatically increase my prospecting numbers
to reflect my lack of adaptability in my approach and presentation.

Figuring Out Your DISC Style
Effective selling happens when competence and confidence con-
nect. Most people have a higher level of confidence when they can
tap into their own natural selling style: For one person, that may
mean building a relationship (Steady); for someone else it may
mean delivering an Academy Award–winning presentation
(Influencer).
So when are you the most confident? Your style greatly affects how
you interact with others and how you approach your sales goals.
In the remainder of this chapter, I help you discover your own
behavior style and — I hope — lead you to a greater understanding
of who you are. With that info, I hope you can get a clearer picture
of the way you work, so you can work with more confidence (and
higher sales). (For more info about your prospect’s behavioral
style and why you need to understand it, check out Chapter 17.)
Know thyself; take the test
To be most effective in your communication efforts, you must first
understand yourself. Then you can figure out how to adapt your
sales style in order to effectively reach and sell to all behavior
types. To advance your career by using the DISC model, you must
take one action step right now — take the test!
To identify your primary behavioral style, go to the Sales
Champions Web site, www.SalesChampions.com/FreeDISC, and
take the free behavior-style assessment. It takes less than 10 min-
utes to answer the 12 questions, and you get the results back via
e-mail within minutes. During the assessment, you answer ques-
tions that give you choices of words to decide if you’re most like
them or least like them to pinpoint your behavioral style. Then you
receive a report with information about you and your behavioral
style. This report points you in the right direction so you can begin
to use your behavioral style to your telephone-sales advantage.
Reacting under fire
Based on your behavioral style, you tend to respond to situations
in predictable ways. Pressurized situations bring on those
responses faster and stronger. For example, if you’re behind on
quota, if it’s the end of the month, or if you’re talking to a large
potential account, your natural tendencies are more pronounced.
Chapter 16: Exploding Your Earnings through Behavioral Selling 211

Where do you score on the DISC test? Look at the sections earlier
in this chapter that explain each behavioral style. None of the natu-
ral tendencies are inherently bad. But they can become a barrier to
a sale if they’re not aligned with the customer’s behavioral style.
And if the salesperson is under pressure, the behaviors can
strengthen — thereby weakening the sales potential.
You want to be able to learn to recognize the prospect’s behavioral
style quickly so you can communicate more effectively. Your
awareness of your own behavioral style allows you to know your
natural reactions and tendencies so you can protect yoursef from
overpowering your prospect with your strong behavioral charac-
teristics that are out of alignment with theirs.
Recognizing your secondary style
Most people are amalgams of two or more behavioral styles. When
you took the assessment exercise on the Sales Champions Web site
(Oh, you didn’t? Stop what you’re doing and go to www.Sales
Champions.com/FreeDISC), you identified your primary behavioral
style, but I can virtually guarantee that you have a secondary style,
as well.
Your secondary style can be determined by taking a more diagnos-
tically complete DISC assessment that evaluates all four behavioral
categories. It can help you analyze both high and low scores and
their influences on your behavior. If you want to take a more com-
plete version of the test, go to www.saleschampions.com/DISC to
access a more extensive diagnostic assessment for a fee. Your
behavior and how you react in situations is an amalgam of your
high and low scores on the DISC model, although your primary
style has the greatest control of how you react and what you do.
The other styles apply force at times as well. To really understand
yourself as a person and especially a salesperson, you need to
know your whole self.

Selling the Way Your
Customer Wants to Buy
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what behavioral selling is
 Picking up on behavioral styles on the telephone
 Working behavior to work the sale
T
he secret to sales success is simple: Figure out what prospects
want to buy — and sell it to them. Believe me, it’s a lot easier to
give people what they want than to convince them that they want
what you have to offer. The most effective telephone salespeople are
skilled at matching their product or service with the prospect’s
wants and needs — and as a result, they enjoy shorter sales cycles,
greater client connection, less resistance, and more sales.
Everyone has a buying style, a certain manner in which they’re most
comfortable “being sold.” Just like some shoppers are more at ease
buying through catalogs while others prefer to feel the merchandise,
over-the-phone customers also have their style preferences. These
preferences are shaped by the four behavioral styles described in
Chapter 16.
In this chapter, I tell you how to shape your selling approach to
your prospect’s behavioral style. This art of selling in a manner the
client is most receptive to is called behavioral selling or behavior-
based selling.
Understanding the Power 
of Behavioral Selling
People exhibit their behavioral styles in everything they do. All
you have to do is watch and listen. And what you discover can take

Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
214
you far in the sales world. Successful behavioral selling is persuad-
ing someone to take an action — or take an action faster — that
results in a benefit by aligning your selling style to the prospect’s
behavioral style. The goal is to align your communication in a style
or pattern that causes the prospect to hear and understand.
The key word in behavioral selling is benefit. If your offer doesn’t
benefit your prospect, and you try to sell to him anyway because
you need the sale, you’re not selling him something he needs.
You’re manipulating him into buying something. Behavioral selling
isn’t about verbal judo or about tricking, maneuvering, or manipu-
lating a prospect into buying.
To more completely understand behavioral selling and what it
means to you and your sales, check out the following three truths:
 People tend to buy from others who have a similar behavioral
style. Behavior studies support the fact that people are most
comfortable with others just like themselves. When you meet
someone with a similar background, similar interests, and
similar mannerisms, you tend to connect more quickly and
experience a higher level of trust.
People buy from people they like. And they like others who
are like themselves. So . . . if you want to make more sales, you
have to be liked. And to be liked, you have to be like the
person you’re selling to.
For example, fast-talking, bottom-line Dominants can keep up
with each other; data-focused Compliants share facts and fig-
ures to support their connection. (See Chapter 16 for detailed
descriptions of the four behavioral styles and to find out what
your style is.) When like styles are partnered, it makes the
sales process smoother and easier.
 Salespeople tend to sell to others who have a similar 
behavioral style. Have you ever just clicked with a prospect on
the first call? That’s what often happens when you encounter
someone who shares your behavioral style. And this ease in
communication continues through the sales process until the
successful close. The fact that the close ratio for style-to-style
sales is much higher than in those situations with a different
style comes at no surprise. You’re more likely to make a sale
when you and the prospect understand each other.
 Salespeople who adapt to the prospect’s behavioral style
increase their sales significantly. You can’t rely on the first two
rules to carry you to sales success. Consider these numbers:
• 18 percent of the world’s population is a Dominant.
• 28 percent of the world’s population is an Influencer.

Chapter 17: Selling the Way Your Customer Wants to Buy 215
• 40 percent of the world’s population is a Steady.
• 14 percent of the world’s population is a Compliant.
For the sake of illustration, say that you’re a Dominant: You
can guarantee selling to another Dominant, but you’ll never
successfully close the other three styles. This means, then,
that the highest close rate that you can expect is 18 percent.
Or, in order to increase your close rate, you must limit your-
self to approaching Dominants only. Either way, you’re not
giving yourself very good odds of success. If, however, you
can change your style to complement the behaviors of others
different than you, you open your universe of potential.
When you adapt your selling approach to allow for the behavioral
style of your prospect, your chances of success shoot up, based on
my experiences, by 25 percent to 50 percent.
Recognizing Behavioral 
Styles Over the Phone
Selling over the phone does challenge your ability to zero in on
behavioral styles — clues in facial expression and body language
are often key in distinguishing Dominants from Steadies and
Influencers from Compliants. But picking up on a prospect’s behav-
ioral style over the phone is far from impossible!
Three factors help you determine behavioral style without the benefit
of face-to-face contact. When selling over the phone, you can
successfully ID behavioral styles by tuning in to these helpful clues:
Look for the clues
I have been studying, teaching, and coaching behavioral selling for almost ten years.
I learned and perfected the skill by observing everyone I met or talked to and taking
mental notes of the way they communicated: their pace, tonality, conviction, vocal
volume, and choice of words. I watched newsmagazine shows such as 20/20,
Dateline, and 60 Minutes to study the behavioral styles of interviewees and inter-
viewers and catch the differences between, say, Barbara Walters’s style and that
of John Stossel or Ted Koppel.
But the interviewers’ approaches weren’t determined by their behavioral styles
alone. The best interviewers adjusted their discussion based on the behavioral style
of the interviewee.

 Pace
 Tonality
 Choice of words
This section explains these three clues more in depth so you can
identify them and use them to your advantage.
Keeping the pace
Pace helps you separate the four styles into “fast” and “slow”
camps. Pace is the speed at which people talk. If they talk at 150
words a minute with gusts up to 200 words a minute, you’re talking
with a Dominant or Influencer. (You can figure this out within the
first few seconds of your conversation.) Most of the time Steadies
and Compliants are slow talkers and Dominants and Influencers
are in the fast lane.
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
216
Behavioral style can align with job title
As you better understand behavioral style, you may find that simply by knowing an
individual’s job title, you can better pinpoint the behavioral style. It only makes sense
that certain behavioral styles match certain jobs or occupations better than others.
For example, the CEO or entrepreneurial owner of a company is highly likely to be
a Dominant or an Influencer. Don’t count on running into many Steadies or
Compliants. The high-risk-tolerant D or I is better suited for this position. Dominants
and Influencers also dominate real estate sales in high-priced resort areas such as
West Palm Beach, Florida, or Aspen, Colorado.
If you sell to mid-level managers or provide technology products for the account-
ing of the company, you’ll find more Steady or Compliant behavioral styles. Steady
people become rooted in companies. They don’t like risk or change, so they don’t
change jobs as readily as others. If you’re selling products to accounting, you also
see a higher concentration of Steady and Compliant behavioral styles because they
like rules, procedures, systems, and processes. That would be the opposite of sell-
ing to someone who likes to bend the rules.
It doesn’t mean you won’t see High Steady or Compliant prospects in high-powered
jobs like CEOs or as entrepreneurial owners; it only means you’ll see less of them
than in the normal population mix. Why they are less likely in those positions is fun-
damental to the risk and reward of the Steady and Compliant. The lower numbers
in those positions are also contained in the lack of need for showy, ego-enjoyment
items in their lives. The Steady and Compliant people don’t need the latest, great-
est, newest, fastest, or flashiest stuff. They’re naturally more conservative with their
money and possessions.

After you determine the rate at which your prospect talks, you can
adjust your speed accordingly. Don’t risk being labeled “slow” or
“behind” because you’re not keeping up with the Dominants or
Influencers. Conversely, if you’re talking to a Steady or Compliant,
apply the brakes.
Tuning in to tonality
You can also identify your prospect’s behavioral style over the
phone by checking for tonality. Tonality is the force or intensity of
your prospect’s voice. It also relates to the friendliness and
warmth in the tone as well. You can quickly narrow down a
person’s behavioral style through tonality.
For example, have you ever listened in on a conversation in an
unfamiliar language? Even without watching the discussion or
understanding a single word, you probably had a good sense of the
relationship between the two: whether the two were romantic,
angry at each other, or worried; whether one seemed to be the
leader; and even whether you liked or disliked both, or one more
than the other.
You were able to discern these factors because of the tonality of
the conversation. And you can use tonality to help narrow down
the behavioral style of your on-the-phone prospect as well. Table
17-1 lists key tonal characteristics of speech for each of the four
behavioral types.
Table 17-1
Tonality and Behavioral Styles
Behavioral Style
Tone of Voice
Dominant
Strong, loud, clear, direct, confident
Influencer
High and low modulation, warm and friendly,
enthusiastic, high energy level
Steady
Soft, warm, low volume, steady pace
Compliant
Direct, deep questioning, low modulation, controlled,
thoughtful
Notice that some styles share some of the characteristics: Both the
Dominant and Compliant are direct, for example. But the unique
combination of qualities is what helps you distinguish each type.
The Dominant is direct with force, speaking at a louder range and
driving the words with energy and strength. The Compliant speaks
directly, but with more deliberation and reserve. Both the Influencer
Chapter 17: Selling the Way Your Customer Wants to Buy 217

and the Steady convey warmth and openness, but the Influencer
expresses more energy and varying modulation when speaking.
The Steady speaks more evenly and at a lower volume.
After you pick up on tonality, you can modify your speech
accordingly. For example, when speaking with an energetic
Influencer, you can add more vivaciousness and variety. If you’re
speaking to a Compliant, speak more controlled and more direct.
Listening for code words
The vocabulary your prospects choose is influenced by experience
and perspective, but it’s also shaped by their behavioral style. And
by listening to the words your prospects select, you can discover a
secret code that reveals that style.
For example, because Dominants have a high need to compete and
win, their words, content, and analogies reflect that perspective. 
(If you’ve observed my use of sports and athletic competition
throughout this book, you could easily draw the conclusion that
I’m a High Dominant — and you’d be right.)
Take a look at Table 17-2 for some of the words, phrases, and expres-
sions that can telegraph a prospect’s behavioral identity. Hang this
list next to your phone so you can monitor the words your prospects
use in conversation. After you identify their behavioral style, then
use this list as a guide to use correct words with them.

Influencer’s attention; while offering the tested and proven product

no-risk guarantee is likely to engage a Compliant.
Preparing for Questions
“Be prepared” is the motto for boy scouts and conscientious tele-
phone salespeople alike. That’s why you rehearse and practice
responses to anticipated questions on a regular basis. With an
understanding of the four behavioral styles, you can do an even
better job of preparing for the types of questions each may ask.
(Check out Chapter 10 for why questions can help you.)
Typically, Dominants and Influencers ask fewer questions than
Steadies and Compliants. This often means that you can get to the
conclusion of the process a lot faster. Although Dominants and
Influencers do ask fewer questions, the questions they do ask are
as critical to reaching a positive conclusion as the battery of
queries from the others. This section looks at some types of ques-
tions the four different behavioral styles may ask you and how you
can respond to them to keep your sales presentation on track.
Dominant: Getting to the point
Dominant questions are delivered directly and forcefully and are
sometimes designed to intimidate you. They want to test your con-
viction in your product and in yourself. Prepare for questions like:
 Who else have you told this to?
 What’s my bottom-line cost?
 Are you sure this is right for us?
Answer with to-the-point, brief statements that scream confidence.
If you waffle, give away control, or hesitate too long, the Dominant
loses respect for you.
Influencer: Seeking status
Influencers deliver their questions with warmth and even
playfulness — they may lightly spar with you over price. Because
establishing a connection is important to them, they may probe for
your feelings. They also want answers that assure them that they’re
buying a product that others may envy or desire. Influencers crave
the latest and greatest — as much for recognition and status as for
efficiency and productivity.
Chapter 17: Selling the Way Your Customer Wants to Buy 219

Influencers may ask you questions like the following:
 Why do you feel we should buy it?
 How much newer is this latest technology?
 How many others have it?
 Can you lower your price a little?
Respond to an Influencer’s questions more informally. Provide the
Influencer with detail — not the facts-and-figures stuff the
Compliant demands, but the emotional benefits of your product.
Steady: Avoiding “no”
A Steady’s questions are typically nonconfrontational and service
oriented. Steadies seek a high level of security before they’re will-
ing to make a commitment, and may request more information as a
stall tactic. For example:
 Have there been times that it didn’t work? Tell me about those.
 I receive good service; why should I make a change?
 How long have you been in business?
 What happens if it doesn’t work?
 I need time to think it over — could I call you in a week?
Provide Steadies with answers that reassure them. Be patient and
willing to spend time, but be careful of the time waster who isn’t
going to buy but can’t tell you so. Steadies hate to say no and may
drag you along for quite some time. You must get them committed
to specific time frames when the decision will be made in the
future. If you don’t, you could still be trying to sell them a year
from now.
Compliant: Working the plan
A Compliant’s typical questioning process is exactly that — a
process. Compliants don’t do anything without a highly organized
plan behind it. They want all the facts, figures, data, and studies
that they can get. And they want to eliminate any possibility of
risk. A 99-percent probability of success is, in many cases, too low
for them. Expect questions such as:
 What is the warranty you offer?
 What qualifications do you posses?
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
220

 How long has this product been out?
 What’s the return or refund rate on it?
 What other facts can you share with me?
 I don’t have to decide now, do I?
Be prepared with studies, reports, resources, and references. Include
facts, figures, and percentages in your responses. Compliants want
reassurance, just as the Steadies do (see preceding section) — but
Compliants want solid data to back up those reassurances.
Steering the Sale with
Driving Forces
Everyone has some inner motivation — a combination of what they
want and what they fear — that dictates their actions. These
desires and fears are part of the behavioral profile. As you figure
out how to recognize each behavioral style in your phone contacts,
you’re better positioned to steer your sales presentation to their
driving forces. Table 17-3 identifies the motivators and fears that
determine the four driving forces.
Table 17-3
Determining the Four Driving Forces
Behavioral Style
Driving Forces
Dominant
Competition, sense of urgency, change, results
oriented, fear of being taken advantage of
Influencer
Communication, talking it out, trust and recognition,
verbal skills, self-confidence, fear of social rejection 
Steady
Sensitivity to others, adaptability, listening to
others, persistence, dislike of confrontation, fear
of losing status quo
Compliant
Precision and accuracy, high quality control, the
details, aversion to change, fear of failure and
criticism
Put this table by your phone and reference it. It can give you a peak
into what actions your prospect may take and how she may react in
certain situations. For example, with a Dominant you need to assure
her that you’ll do what you say you will do and that you’re confident
in the results and your delivery, because Dominants fear being taken
advantage of by others.
Chapter 17: Selling the Way Your Customer Wants to Buy 221

This section explains how to shape your sales process to address
these driving forces and to help you keep it on track. (See Chapter
16 for detailed descriptions of the driving forces of each style.)
Motivating your prospect to buy
After you establish a prospect’s behavioral style, you’re equipped
to prepare a series of statements to wrap into your conversations
and sales presentation — statements that are designed to motivate
the prospect into taking action. By preparing such statements in
advance, you’re ready to say the right thing to the prospect at the
right time.
You can use the following statements verbatim or adapt them to
your specific sales needs. They work well verbatim when used like
scripts that are delivered to the right behavioral style.
 Statements that motivate a High D:
• “Our service provides you an opportunity to achieve the
goals you desire right away.”
• “This product will put you on the cutting edge. We are
the leader in this field.”
• “You can easily see the advantage and how, by using our
service, you will beat your competition.”
 Statements that motivate a High I:
• “We are offering this revolutionary product to only a few
initial prospects like yourself.”
• “By using our service, you will easily be recognized as a
manager who is going somewhere in your company.”
• “We offer the most advanced, cutting-edge line in the
industry.”
 Statements that motivate a High S:
• “I have a list of people who went through the same chal-
lenges as you. Our tested program really helped them.
Feel free to give them a call.”
• “Others have found that this product is the perfect solu-
tion to their problems. I am sure you will evaluate the
information carefully and come to the same conclusion.”
• “Here is a comprehensive packet of information that will
provide you with all the information needed to make a
wise decision.”
• “By moving forward with me, you will have the security
of knowing that you will get the outcome that you want.”
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
222

 Statements that motivate a High C:
• “After you examine all the facts, you will see that this
will be the right next step for you.”
• “This is a proven service. We have been in business for
25 years and have helped people like you, so you know
we are someone you can rely on.”
• “You can see that our warranty eliminates any risk on
your part. I stand behind our service and proven results
100 percent.”
• “After the presentation, you will be in the position to
examine the facts, interpret them easily, and draw the
conclusion that we should work together.”
Turning around a wrong-way course
Even the best salespeople run into an occasional roadblock. You’re
in the middle of a call with a prospect and it’s clear that you’re
losing ground: Even if this is a first conversation and you haven’t
had a chance to verify behavioral style yet, you can read some
clues that can help you determine the style and, better yet, how to
get back on track.
Re-engaging a Dominant
A Dominant prospect expresses disinterest by openly challenging
or disagreeing with you. You can almost see through the phone
lines that the prospect is glancing at a clock or checking e-mail for
something worth attending to.
To regain the attention of the High D:
 Be brief, be bright, and be gone. The High D has more on his
plate than time. He is acutely aware of that and doesn’t want
anyone to waste it. Hit him hard with your benefits and why
he should act now.
 Skip the testimonials. The High D won’t be very impressed
with them. He’s focused on the results. He wants to know
what’s in it for him.
 Be direct and business-like — no small talk. He isn’t inter-
ested in building a relationship at this point, if ever. He will
turn you off if you use the typical common-ground bonding
type of techniques that many salespeople use.
 Get to the point quickly and solve his problem. He wants
results for his problems. The more sightseeing you do on the
way to delivering those results, the less likely the sale.
Chapter 17: Selling the Way Your Customer Wants to Buy 223

Warming up a High I
An Influencer makes negative or skeptical comments. It’s not a good
sign when the naturally optimistic I is reserved. You may also pick
up on attempts to get off the phone and on to something more
engaging.
These tweaks just may jazz the Influencer into listening:
 Allow time to warm up and socialize. The Influencer likes to
interact and communicate. She wants to build a relationship,
so be conversational.
 Have focus, make it fun, and use stories. She loves good sto-
ries that connect her to you or to the sale. The best stories
are about clients that are powerful, well respected, and well
known. It gives you the celebrity factor with her.
 Hit the high points; don’t be too detailed. The Influencer
isn’t a detail person. She is a more big-picture, feeling person.
If it feels right, she does it.
 Present with a sizzle the new, showy services. The Influencer
likes flash, glitz, and sizzle in what she buys, so give it to her.
The Influencer always has the new car when the new model
comes out. Tie your product or service to the cutting edge.
Taking it slow with a Steady
Clues that the Steady isn’t connecting are the most subtle of the
four types. The High S hates confrontation. When you notice the
points you’ve already covered continue to be raised, you know
you’ve lost the prospect.
Recapture the Steady with these approaches:
 Earn trust and friendship first — talk about family and hob-
bies. The Steady is stable; family is a big part of his life.
 Take it slow and steady. With a Steady, speed kills the sale. If
you are too fast, he can think that you’re too slick, not trust-
worthy, and too great a risk to buy from.
 Use plenty of proof and statistics to make your point. He
isn’t swayed by a showy product or delivery. He weighs the
facts. If you don’t share any proof, he can assume that you
don’t have any. That means, to him, you’re either not prepared
or what you’re saying is all hype.
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
224

 Answer all questions and confirm agreement. You must dig
for his views, opinions, concerns, and agreement. A Steady
will tell the waiter the meal was outstanding when it wasn’t
and just go quietly and never return to the restaurant. If he
tells you everything is fine, you can be assured that it most
likely is not.
Serving up data to the Compliant
You know you’re off-base with the High C when the prospect turns
evasive and unresponsive. You may get nothing more than a few
grunts and “uh-huhs.” On the other hand, the Compliant may chal-
lenge you with impossible questions in order to end the call.
When you get this response, it’s time to try a different tack:
 Allow time for absorbing details and facts. Your sales cycle
will be longer with a Compliant because of the need to digest
all the data. Be patient.
 Use other Compliant or Steady behavioral-styled people as
sources of testimonials. She wants as much proof as possible
because she wants to avoid being wrong at all costs.
 Avoid small talk; get to the point with truckloads of support
data in hand. She doesn’t want a relationship but evidence of
a successful outcome. The more data you can provide, the
better. She believes that data lowers her level of risk.
 Present only established and proven products. If you’re sell-
ing something revolutionary and new, a Compliant won’t buy
it. What she hears you saying is that you’re selling something
that is untested at this point.
Customizing your close
Your prospect’s behavioral style dictates how you close your pres-
entation. You wouldn’t tie up the sale with a Steady the same way
you would with a Dominant. The following sections show you how
to tweak your close based on the different styles. (Check out
Chapter 14 for more general info about drafting a successful close.)
Sealing the deal with Dominants
High Dominants respond best to strong closes that offer them choices
and let them feel in control. Choices are a good way to go because
Dominants value their opinion more than they value yours. Having a
choice means they don’t have to feel taken advantage of — which is
their primal fear.
Chapter 17: Selling the Way Your Customer Wants to Buy 225

Check out the following close you may make with a Dominant:
“Bob, I thought that the 4300 was the right model for you, but
maybe I made a mistake. Maybe we should look at your budget
range again. Maybe this isn’t the model for you.”
This close, known as the take-away, can be very effective, but you
have to be gutsy to use it. Basically, you seem to take away the
prospect’s opportunity to buy your product. The response from a
Dominant is typically to fight for the product rather than let you win.
Wrapping it up with Influencers
With High Influencers, you find that offering choices and emphasiz-
ing status or image work well. To appeal to the Influencer’s need to
be admired, try this:
“Bob, imagine what it will feel like walking across the platform to
receive the top salesperson award next year because you took
the exclusive step right now of hiring a sales coach. Can’t you just
hear the applause?”
The truth is that Influencers are the easiest type of behavioral style
to close and sell. They naturally want to buy now and ask questions
later. Remember, feelings and emotions are important to Influencers.
They’re quick to act when recognition, feelings, exclusivity, ego, and
friendship align.
Closing with Steadies and Compliants
Both the Steady and Compliant respond well to the same type of
close — their concern with making the right decision and ensuring
security makes the opportunity to “test-drive” the product very
appealing.
“Bob, I can offer you a trial period to test drive our 5600 model.
This test drive periods carries a “send it back no questions
asked” 30 days, so you really have no risk here — we have
assumed it all. Is that something that you would be interested in?”
Including a guarantee, warranty, trial period, no-obligation arrange-
ment, full refund, or no-questions-asked promise takes the risk away
from the decision. These slow-to-commit types find it easier to make
a yes decision with this kind of protection.

eing motivated and keeping that motivation is like taking a
shower. Sure, the occasional workshop, a steady flow of per-
sonal-development books and CDs, and the incentive awards
offered by your company certainly spark a surge of enthusiasm.
But staying motivated is an every-day ablution. You need it more
than once if you want it to do any good.
Telephone salespeople encounter pressures, challenges, and con-
flicts on a daily basis. And the more productive the individual, the
more challenges are generated. A steady stream of wear and tear
can drain even the best professionals.
Ah, but you have ways to stop those motivation leaks. Performing
certain habits and practices daily can help you keep an “up” atti-
tude afloat. In this chapter, I discuss some of the strategies I’ve
passed on to hundreds of thousands of sales professionals and
have used to keep me motivated all these years.
Getting a Grip on Motivation
To paraphrase Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, motivation is
hard to define, but we know it when we have it. Although motivation
may be hard to put into words, its results are explicit. It exposes itself
via unbounded energy, intense desire to stay on task, and the ability
to endure with little effort what may ordinarily be excruciatingly
uninteresting or tedious. Not quite sure why motivation is important

in sales or what you need to do to stay motivated? This section
explains the importance of discipline and how it can improve your
motivation, as well as other actions you can do to stay motivated.
Understanding why you need 
discipline to stay motivated
To keep the flames of motivation stoked, you need to be disci-
plined. Discipline isn’t magical; it’s merely movement. At its core,
discipline is a self-management process that aligns with and pro-
motes your goals, priorities, and objectives. Discipline is action
oriented — an act of will, not an act of feelings. If you wait until you
feel disciplined or until someone provides discipline for you, you
may find yourself tapping your fingers for a long time to come.
Discipline is more than a building block for success; it’s a keystone.
Discipline can keep you upright even if other fundamentals — the
economy, for example — are shaky. Discipline can see you through
work upheavals and even seismic shifts in your particular industry.
Discipline means you adhere consistently and regularly to the
tasks of being a top salesperson. A high-performance salesperson
applies discipline to routine telephone-sales activities, such as:
 High daily volume of prospecting contacts
 Effective lead categorization and lead follow-up
 Routine practice of scripts, dialogues, and sales skills
 Regular physical workout habits
 Consistent personal development time in reading, listening,
and attending personal-growth programs
In the following sections, I show you how discipline is related to
motivation and how you can use discipline to make your sales plan
and carry it out.
Discipline and motivation: A chicken-and-egg conundrum
When I ask salespeople which comes first, motivation or discipline,
most answer with motivation. Their view is that the higher their
motivation level, the more disciplined they act. That may be true —
for average sales performers. Motivation — or a lack thereof — can
certainly influence diligence to the details of prospecting, lead
follow-up, honing skills, and role-playing scripts.

Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 229
For the top salesperson, however, discipline comes first, and then
discipline feeds motivation. The discipline expended to organize
and make contacts leads to business, which increases motivation,
which then generates more discipline, which results in . . . well,
you get the picture.
Expecting motivation before discipline is like negotiating with a
wood stove: “I will put some wood in you if you give me some heat
first.” I hate to throw a bucket of cold water on anyone, but life just
doesn’t work that way.
Relying on discipline to make your sales plan
Planning takes discipline — just as much as, if not more than, actu-
ally carrying out the work. You must set aside the necessary time
to evaluate conditions, construct a strategy that takes advantage
of those conditions and optimizes your skills, and identify and
address weaknesses and challenges.
Then after you’ve developed your plan, actually implementing and
staying with the sales plan also takes a great deal of discipline.
Salespeople often give up on the plan before it takes full root and
produces the desired results. Effort is what pays off.
Even without immediate results, discipline — when applied to a
well-thought-out plan — brings about a sense of confidence and
optimism. And these, my friends, are the seeds of motivation.
So how can you add some discipline into your life? First thing each
morning, remind yourself that you’re motivated! Keep the following
tips in mind to help:
Money can’t be your sole motivator
Too many people use money as their sole motivating factor as salespeople. This
single-track focus can lead to poor results or a prolonged slump in sales growth as
your sales career matures.
Don’t overemphasize the importance of money as a motivator. A new salesperson
may find money the supreme motivator. But it ceases to be a motivational tool when
you have achieved many of your financial goals in life. After you have money and
wealth, you’ll need to find another motivator like service, standards, personal per-
formance, or a personal belief system. When someone is comfortable financially, it
becomes more challenging for them to motivate themselves to prospect at the same
level as when they where broke if money is their most important motivation tool.

 Review your goals at least once a day. Write down your goals
on small cards to keep in your wallet. Tape them to your
mirror. Stick them in your sun visor. Make them your screen-
saver. Looking at your goals several times a day increases
your motivation to achieve them, which in turn helps you
increase your discipline.
 Resolve today to decide on one disciplined action you
should take, and do it. Don’t wait until tomorrow; do it today.
Don’t wait until you feel like it, because you probably never
will. Make the decision right now to do it!
Being disciplined in your calls raises your motivation level to make
more calls, and when you stay disciplined and consistent in those
calls, you will see results, which will further increase your motivation.
Taking care of your body
Consider your body a fuel tank that keeps your motivation run-
ning. If your energy reserves are depleted or if you fail to maintain
your health, your motivation (not to mention overall performance)
may stall or — worse — crash and burn.
In order to keep your body fueled and ready to go, make sure you
do what it takes to stay healthy and fit. Get the rest and sleep that
your body needs. (You know your body the best.) Make sure you
eat regular, healthful meals and exercise, based on what your
doctor recommends is right for you.
Keeping your emotions tuned up
In addition to taking care of your body, you also have another
energy tank — one that holds your emotional reserves — that
needs fostering. Your emotional well-being is more complex and
requires greater effort to avoid depleting it. It can also be more
temperamental, so operate with care.
One of the greatest dangers to your emotional balance is other
people’s emotions. Don’t let others — whether staff, colleagues,
clients, or even your boss — dump their negativity on you, which
not only drains your energy, but also may do damage that could
take a week or more to repair.

Living at a High Attitude
A positive, upward-looking attitude goes a long way toward helping
you achieve your goals, whether meeting your daily prospecting
numbers or attaining a lifelong dream.
So how’s your attitude? Does it need an improvement? Are you
positive and upbeat? If your attitude projects every obstacle as a new
opportunity, success comes much easier. This section shows you how
your attitude can make a huge impact on your motivational level.
Keeping your attitude in check
Having the right attitude starts with no one else but you. So what
are you waiting for? Start building your attitude today. Projecting a
positive attitude when faced with challenges helps you resolve
them more effectively and increases your odds of making a sale.
Conveying an optimistic outlook with a problem client may be the
factor that transforms your encounter from “fail” to “sale.”
Convince yourself that you’re the best salesperson anyone could
hire. Until you’re convinced, persuading others won’t be easy.
The best way to develop and build a healthy attitude is by saying
daily affirmations. Affirmations drive positive mental pictures into
your subconscious mind — and they’re so simple to use. Simply
say to yourself statements affirming your positive qualities and
successes — or goals you aspire to achieve.
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 231
Overdoing it can really zap your motivation
I once coached a man who sold costly personal consulting. He was in the midst of
expanding his business, but was struggling to achieve his prospecting goals each
day. As I probed, I discovered he was seriously overextending himself. He wasn’t
getting to bed until after 11 p.m., and then was going to the gym at 5 a.m. each morn-
ing. He wasn’t getting enough rest!
A little more digging and I learned that he wasn’t getting to sleep until later because
he didn’t get home from work until after 7 p.m. most nights. By the time he had dinner
(with or without the family), spent time with his children and put them to bed, caught
up on world events, and talked with his wife, the clock was approaching midnight.
However, after he made the commitment to be home for dinner at 6 p.m., his
prospecting improved dramatically and was more consistent.

Make a daily habit of saying your affirmations — whether you use
the ones here or create your own — out loud with confidence and
conviction. I recommend doing it first thing each morning. In this
way, you program your brain to be positive for the day.
Affirmations also come in handy when you have a mid-day crisis or
conflict. I suggest repeating them aloud a number of times each
day, such as when you’re stopped in traffic or waiting to pick the
kids up from soccer practice.
Some affirmations I recommend that you say include the following:
 I am a great salesperson.
 I am skilled at handling objections and getting the contract
signed.
 People do business with me because I am positive, knowl-
edgeable, and professional.
 I earn _______________ (you fill the blank).
Your subconscious mind doesn’t have a filter to stop thoughts,
ideas, and statements from entering it as truth. That’s the value of
affirmations — your ability to drive deep into your subconscious
mind the positive feelings of your success even before you experi-
ence the outward signs or manifestations of that success.
Controlling your environment
One of the best ways to secure a positive attitude is to guard your
environment. As a salesperson, you face lots of interactions through-
out your day with clients, prospects, management, and coworkers.
And these interactions expose you to plenty of potential for “attitude
adjustment.” Of course, you can’t avoid this contact — it’s part of
your job. But you can control it. Here are some suggestions:
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
232
Edison’s attitude illuminated his work
You can find thousands of examples in life of how some people took lemons and,
with a great attitude, made lemonade. For example, Thomas Edison was said to have
developed the light bulb because darkness interfered with his ability to conduct fur-
ther experiments. He wanted to be able to work long into the night. Edison could
have moaned about the darkness, but that wouldn’t have done any good. He used
his positive attitude and solved the problem of darkness.

 Lower your risk of attitude attack by guarding against inter-
ruptions that distract you from the important work of
prospecting and lead follow-up. Do everything you can to dis-
courage office drop-ins and phone calls. (Chapter 8 includes
some help for nipping interruptions in the bud.)
 For all the encounters you can’t avoid, make sure your eyes
are open for signs of attitude sappers: coworkers decrying
management and unfair policies; the boss bemoaning the
downturns in the industry; friends urging that you could do
better elsewhere. When you recognize the signs, get out of the
situation as quickly as you can. End the phone call, leave the
room, plead a meeting or appointment, or show your guest to
the door.
Putting on a little persistence
Bad things happen to good salespeople. It’s a fact of life. Making
mistakes, hearing the word no, losing sales, and falling short of
goals will happen to you at some point. But these incidents aren’t
final or fatal — unless you choose to give up.
As discipline begets motivation (see the earlier section,
“Understanding why you need discipline to stay motivated”), per-
sistence fosters attitude. Persistence is a resolved mindset to con-
tinue on even in the face of adversity or preliminary negative
results. It sees you through tough times, and getting past those
tough times renews your positive attitude.
“Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.” So said
Calvin Coolidge, 30th president of the United States. “Talent will 
not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.
Geniuses will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education
will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and
determination alone are omnipotent.”
So what’s the best way to make persistence part of your routine?
Just start. That first step is what stops most people: tying your
sneakers and stepping on the treadmill or picking up the phone to
make the first call. After you begin, you pick up momentum and the
positive self-talk of accomplishment.
Protecting your attitude
Remember that you’re the master of your attitude. You have the
power to change it for the better. Unfortunately, you also have 
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 233

the power to hand it over to someone else who may not treat it 
so well. I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to guard 
your attitude (which isn’t, let me say, the same as having a guarded 
attitude).
Your attitude plays a major role in determining how high you’ll climb
in your life. Treat it as a precious valuable, and be aware that some-
times the most notorious attitude thieves are those closest to you:
coworkers, friends, neighbors, family, or even your significant other!
For example, years ago, I had the pleasure of working with an
outstanding coach, one of the best employees I ever had. But after
some time, he let a close friend with a toxic attitude contaminate his
own. He became discontented and soon left the company. Now,
believe me, nothing makes me happier than when a coach or sales-
person who works for me becomes so successful that he’s ready to
move on to greater challenges. But this man didn’t leave under those
circumstances. He left with a poisoned attitude that he apparently
carried with him. He struggled for three years to establish a speaking
and coaching career independently of my company’s.
To protect your attitude, be careful of who you grant the access to
affluence your life. Make the decision each morning when you
wake up that you will have a positive attitude all day. Be quick to
holler “Next!” when you encounter a prospect that doesn’t want
what you are offering.
Getting in the Zone: Taking Your
Game to the Next Level
Professional athletes aspire to be in the zone, a place where they
can’t miss the basket, a putt, the target, a goal, or a home run. A
few years ago, I watched David Duvall shoot a 59 in the last round
to win the Bob Hope golf tournament. His longest putt that day was
about 10 feet. He truly was in the zone — his mind and body were
working together in a masterful performance.
Telephone salespeople can also aspire to be in the zone. In fact, I’m
certain you’ve already been there: that day you walked away with
signed contracts (at your price and terms) from every presentation,
or the day every prospecting call you made ended in a lead or
appointment.
Sure, every telephone-sales professional worth her salt has had such
experiences. But top salespeople know how to use attitude — along
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
234

with the following tools and tactics — to increase the opportunities
to perform in the zone. This section highlights specifically what you
can do to get yourself ready so your sales presentation is successful.
Developing a pre-activity routine
No matter what action you’re taking in your sales presentation,
you can establish a pre-activity routine, a set series of actions that
you take every time to help improve your efforts and results. For
example, have you ever followed a golf pro during a tournament?
The golfer performs the same series of actions, in the same
sequence, through each shot or putt. If something breaks the con-
centration during the pre-shot routine, he starts all over again.
After you establish an effective pre-activity routine, commit it to 
a checklist or a list of steps and make sure you follow it regularly.
Here is an example of a pre-activity routine for a sales presentation:
1. For 30 minutes before your presentation, review antici-
pated questions and responses.
2. Identify the key benefits that you want to highlight to the
prospect.
3. Practice responses to objections you expect.
4. “Give” your presentation before you make it to the
prospect.
5. Listen to music, whether in your office or in the car, that
relaxes and focuses you on your task.
6. Take control of your emotions before you make the call.
No matter if you’re prospecting, following up on leads, giving pre-
sentations, or negotiating contracts, a pre-activity routine can put
you in the right mindset and lead you to the zone on a more-frequent
basis with heightened results.
Discovering how to relax
To enter the zone — to achieve peak performance — you must be
relaxed. The idea that people perform best under pressure is a mis-
conception; in fact, studies support that the opposite is true. When
you’re relaxed, your body works in unison with your mind. You’re
able to evaluate situations more clearly and make better decisions.
Think about the last time you were in a high-pressure situation —
chances are you weren’t on top of your game. Now, think of one of
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 235

your recent sales successes. You may even recall a feeling of near
serenity, as if you could step outside of yourself and see that
everything was going to end positively.
You can take steps to summon that sense of relaxation. Consider the
following ways to get relaxed. Some of them take a little more time
than others, but they can all get you in a relaxed frame of mind:
 Yoga. This type of exercise may not be your sport of choice,
but it does provide lessons in quieting the mind.
 Deep breaths. Focus on your breath for a few minutes before
an important presentation.
 Stretches: Do some simple stretches to relax your body,
which, as I discuss earlier in the chapter in the section
“Taking care of your body,” can also benefit your mind.
 Physical activity: Before an appointment, take a brisk walk to
release any pent-up tension that may constrict your efforts.
Find what type of activity works for you and use it.
Becoming your own coach
Everyone needs mentors, coaches, and supporters — people who
believe in you and encourage you to achieve your personal best.
But one individual plays a greater role than anyone else in keeping
your attitude up and your motivation in high gear: you.
You can be your own best coach. No matter how the appointment,
negotiation, or prospecting session goes, you need to be there for
you — congratulating yourself for your successes, commending
yourself for going the distance, or encouraging yourself past the
occasional failures. With you on your side, you’re destined for
achievement.
To do so, have regular review or reflection periods at the following
times:
 At the end of the day: Take 30 minutes to review your results,
your contact numbers, the good calls, and what made them
that way. Face what you did poorly and why.
 At the end of the week: Take an hour to go through the same
daily evaluation, but probe the whole week. Focus on your
sales ratios to determine whether they’re in line with your
norm. Who do you need to contact and sell next week? What
are your best prospects heading into next week?
 At the end of the month: Take a few hours and repeat. A
month is a pretty good chunk of time. Learn from your past
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
236

and invest it in your future. Don’t operate like most salespeo-
ple who make the same mistakes over and over again hoping
for a different outcome that never comes.
Hitting the Curveballs: Staying Up
during the Uncertainties
Discipline. Physical and emotional health. Nurturing a can-do atti-
tude. Getting in the zone. Following these strategies is bound to
boost your motivation level (for more info, see previous sections in
this chapter), but be prepared for the curveballs! Just like a star
baseball player, you can warm up faithfully and practice regularly,
or you can be an all-star performer, but those curveballs — those
unexpected occurrences — are guaranteed to come your way.
By accepting that you’re going to be swinging at curveballs from
time to time and not letting them deplete your motivation, you’re
more likely to increase your hits and stay positive. No matter how
prepared you are and how motivated you are, you can’t expect to
hit everything thrown your way. You’re going to get curveballs,
whether uncovering a delayed order, finding out you have been
selling to the wrong person in the company, or discovering their
budget was just cut right as the final order and purchase order
were being processed. In sales, as in life, you strike out sometimes.
Too many salespeople expect perfection. They expect to make a
sale with every lead and even every call. Unfortunately, life isn’t
like that. You have to assume you will strike out a bunch. If it
makes you feel any better, consider this: A major-league baseball
player earns $10 to $15 million a year if they hit above 300. This
means he can fail seven times out of ten — and still be considered
a top trade.
Calm and cool: Going for the singles
Be patient with yourself when your job throws you curveballs. You
may be inclined to respond to a work challenge by tensing up for
the worst, while at the same time ramping up your efforts, pushing
yourself hard to counter the onslaught. You may feel that the
curveball has put you so far behind that you have to put forth
heroic effort to compensate.
In this case, stop, take a deep breath, and recognize that there’s no
shame in hitting a single. You don’t have to hit a home-run sale
every time out. Enough singles turn into runs, which can win the
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 237

game. Curveballs at work can have a devastating effect on your
confidence and motivation. When faced with such a situation, be
realistic and go for a small victory; rebuild your motivation one
phone call at a time.
Head on: Stepping up to the plate
Sometimes when people expect that they’ll face sticky situations,
they find excuses to avoid them. When you anticipate you may
encounter a curveball, the last thing you want to do is run away.
You want to face the curveball head on. In order to keep your moti-
vation at peak level, step up to the plate again and face your fears.
If you’ve been hit by a curveball, it’s understandable that you’d be
a little reluctant to put yourself in a position to take another hit.
You find excuses to avoid anything that might bring you close to a
curveball. You may push off making your daily prospecting calls or
cancel appointments, or you zero in on “safe” activities that keep
you away from curveballs: proofreading your sales letters, putting
your files in order, updating your address list, or offering to lick
stamps and stuff envelopes. But don’t fall victim to the curveball;
step up and try again. (Chapter 6 can give you more pointers about
overcoming call aversion.)
One step ahead: Striking 
out the excuses
Top salespeople don’t focus on excuses; they identify what needs
to be done. They determine what they can and will do first. Don’t
rely on excuses if you’re afraid of an outcome. Leave the excuses at
the door.
I really despise the phrase “I can’t.” I don’t allow people in my com-
pany, my clients, and especially my children to use it. Wesley and
Annabelle know that saying “I can’t” brings a swift response from
Dad and Mom: “We don’t use those words in our family.” Asking for
help is encouraged, but in our house, can’t is a four-letter word.
“I can’t” is the plainest form of an excuse. People who have more
limitations in skills, abilities, and resources than you or I have
accomplished much more. These champions never use the words
“I can’t” as a crutch.
To help you get rid of excuses you may be prone to using, I’d like to
recommend this exercise: Take 15 minutes and create a list of why
you can’t prospect more, sell more, close more, have more money,
or attain a better quality of life. Then ask yourself whether these
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
238

excuses are valid. Do other people have these same excuses? Have
these other people overcome these excuses? Why not me? Then
take the list and burn it, so it’s gone forever. This process brings to
light that you can. It shows you that others have done it, so why not
you. The burning of the list creates the final step to move on.
Staying In the Game through
Lifelong Learning
To keep motivated, I need to have a sense of fulfillment. And to be
fulfilled, I need to keep “filling up.” Daily effort to increase my
knowledge and skills buoys my attitude and charges me with moti-
vation that virtually flows out of me and into others. When I can
motivate others, they, in turn, motivate me.
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 239
How my “education” helped 
build my motivation
When I was in my mid 20s, I felt directionless. I didn’t know why my career felt
stalled or what to do to fuel it up. To say I lacked motivation is an understatement,
that is until I went to a seminar and heard Jim Rohn, the renowned motivational
speaker. He made a comment that day that hit me like a lightning bolt: “Your formal
education will make you make a living; your personal education will make you a for-
tune.” He may have been speaking to me personally.
You see, my formal education wasn’t much to brag about. I graduated in the part of
the high school class that bolstered up the top half. But Rohn made me see that my
academic limitations were of little consequence in terms of my potential. I could
still earn whatever I wanted if I attended to my personal education.
Since that day nearly 20 years ago, the education, training, and coaching I’ve
received has transformed everything about me: my attitude, motivation, energy, pas-
sion, relationships, bank account, net worth, business, and self-image.
My progress was slow at first, but my motivation built slowly. It was so easy to come
home after a hard day’s work, grab the remote, and rest a beer can on my belly.
Making myself read, study, journal, reflect, and replay the mental tape of my day
and week was much harder. As time went on, however, the successes that I accu-
mulated encouraged me to invest further in my continuing education. I read books,
listened to personal development programs, attended seminars, and eventually,
channeled into coaching and training others. 

A hybrid of education, training, and coaching is, from my experi-
ence, the pathway to success. The measurements may differ,
depending on your unique circumstances, but the combination of
these three ingredients creates a potent cocktail for motivation.
This section takes a closer look at how education, training, and
coaching can help you increase your motivation level.
Taking a reality check
I spend a lot of effort encouraging salespeople to do what it 
takes to build optimistic energy, from attitude adjustments to 
self-affirming mantras. But don’t think I’m suggesting that you view
yourself through rose-colored lenses! In order to continue building
your knowledge and sales skills, taking off the glasses and looking 
at yourself in the harsh light of day is absolutely essential. You
must be able to recognize your weaknesses in order to gain the
education you need to overcome them.
Jack Welch, the famous retired CEO of General Electric, had six
rules of business: The first one was to face reality as it is, not as you
wish it to be. Honest self-assessment is a scary thing. Who wants to
be reminded of deficiencies? But doing so is critical. Review your
current performance to determine what skills you need to
strengthen. After you pinpoint which areas you need to improve,
you can easily find classes, books, CDs, and training programs on
those topics.
One of the best assessment tools? Your sales ratios. (Please read
Chapters 3 and 5 for a more in-depth discussion of sales ratios.)
Regular check-ins quickly reveal weak spots. In examining your sales
ratios, you can clearly see the problems in your sales. For example,
if you’re making too many calls to produce too few leads, this usu-
ally means that your initial opening statements and probing on the
phone is poor. You don’t peak enough interest in the prospect to
create a lead. On the other hand, if you have enough leads but
aren’t making sales, you have to evaluate the lead quality and the
presentation you’re making to the leads because your presentation
isn’t powerful enough to compel them to buy and buy now.
When you’re feeling discouraged or unmotivated, shrinking from the
reality of your weaknesses is natural. But the salespeople who rise
to the top in any organization are the ones most willing to be honest
with themselves. Focusing on personal honesty leads to success.
Building on information: Education
The first ingredient to a successful lifelong learning recipe is educa-
tion — the gathering of new and valuable information to help you
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
240

do your job better. Equally important is the review of information
that you may have learned already.
You have a menu of choices when it comes to furthering your
education:
 Sign up for seminars.
 Read books (congratulations; you’ve made a good start reading
this one!).
 Listen to CDs and books on tape while driving.
 Take courses online.
 Go back to school, whether college or continuing-education
classes.
Busy salespeople often complain to me that they simply don’t have
time to learn. I don’t buy it. Although you may not be able to
commit to a semester of evening classes, you’ve got prime time
every day to get in a few new lessons while driving in your car.
Even if your only drive time is a short commute to the office, you
can grab a few minutes’ edification by popping in a CD. Multiply
those ten minutes to and from work by 240 workdays a year, and
you rack up a total of 80 hours of study a year!
Putting skills to practice: Training
In order for you to stay in the game and be at the top of the pack,
you need to continue taking training to expand and build your
skills. Training, like education, involves gathering information, but
at a more in-depth level and, typically, involving your participation.
Education tells you how. Training shows you how. In a training
medium, you’re likely to have hands-on exercises and practice ses-
sions — situations in which you put the lessons into action.
To help you locate some training sessions that may be appropriate
for you, I suggest the following two places to start your search:
 Sales Champions (www.saleschampions.com). Review the
training options that we have available to you. I wouldn’t be
much of a salesperson if I did not believe in what I was selling.
 Business by Phone (www.businessbyphone.com). Art
Sobczak, the company president, does a terrific job in training
telephone salespeople. He has numerous offerings that will
help your career.
Although many salespeople commonly engage in training when
they — or their bosses — spot a deficiency, I challenge you to look
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 241

at training in a new light. Look at ways to attend training sessions
to improve the skills you already do somewhat well. Training in
your sales skills can help you boost your sales and motivation.
Going to a two-day boot camp in sales to spend time learning new
sales techniques, and most importantly, role-playing and practicing
those techniques before you come back to the office to make your
first call, can give you a huge advantage.
Creating sales champs: Coaching
Most important in ensuring your lifelong learning is enlisting the help
of a coach — a mentor or role-model of sorts. Or you can also work
with an individual or a consultant or sign up for a proven program,
such as our Personal Performance Coaching program. In any of
these situations, coaching offers you the experience of an expert,
the objectivity of an outsider who can analyze you and your skills,
determine skills in which you need practice, and provide you with a
personalized game plan for your particular business, goals, and
values.
It’s no accident that, in the world of sports, those teams and indi-
viduals who’ve earned champion status have had coaches who are
often superstars themselves. The world recognizes that it takes
more than a group of healthy, talented individuals to win a Super
Bowl, a World Series, or a basketball championship, and that
celebrities of golf, tennis, or ice-skating don’t stand alone in their
glory. Behind these great successes are great coaches.
Coach Tom Landry, the famous coach of the Dallas Cowboys, said,
“A coach is someone who tells you what you don’t want to hear and
has you see what you don’t want to see, so you can be who you have
always known you can be.” A champion coach helps you shrink the
gap between where you are and what you can be. If you believe you
aren’t achieving your full potential, you’re a prime candidate for a
coach. Whether you turn to your manager for coaching or find an
outside source, a coach can help you tap into that potential.
If you’re serious about increasing your knowledge base and moving
up the ladder of sales, then you seriously need to consider finding
yourself a coach who can share her guidance with you. This sec-
tion gives you some pointers on what a coach can give you and
how you can find a coach.
Knowing what a champion coach can do for you
As you seek out your own coach, you’d be wise to understand
exactly what a champion coach does for you. A champion coach
Part V: Increasing Your Sales 
242

 Has the ability to listen and help you clarify your goals and
vision in all areas of your life. Earl Nightingale, the famous
speaker, stated, “We are goal-seeking organisms.” Sometimes,
however, the difficulty isn’t in achieving goals but in setting
them in the first place.
 Understands that all goals must have deadlines. He encour-
ages you to circle a date for when you want to make your first
million. The good coach knows that timetables and deadlines
help you attain those goals more readily.
 Works with you to create the step-by-step game plan to
achieve your goals. Even monumental projects can be broken
down into bite-sized pieces.
 Helps you understand the consequences of not adhering to
the plan. Doing so forces you to face the connection between
your actions and the results.
 Provides ongoing motivation and inspiration during the dif-
ficult times. Everyone needs people around them who can
help them get through the rough patches.
 Establishes accountability — from you to your plan — and
holds you to the standard you have set for yourself.
Accountability is key. I find that many companies in sales
provide too little of it, so their salespeople don’t reach their
full potential.
I had a client who wanted to earn more than $250,000 for the year,
when the year before he had only earned $130,000. We worked dili-
gently to identify what he needed to do in order to achieve his
goal. After we listed bite-size pieces, we set up his daily routine. By
simply focusing on his daily disciplines, he made progress without
finding himself paralyzed by the weight of his lofty goal. As his
coach, I encouraged him through some rough spots when he
dropped his daily routine. In the end, he exceeded his goal: The
$265,000 he brought home that year reflected an increase in busi-
ness by more than 100 percent.
Finding a coach right for you
You may know you want or need a coach, but where do you start
and how do you know how to find a coach who is right for you?
You need to find a coach who has had success first in sales.
You can first start with your manager. Check to see if she can
commit to coach you. Gain her commitment to spend a specified
amount of time weekly coaching you. Have her hold you account-
able to predetermined standards for prospecting, role-play prac-
tice, lead generation, and sales.
Chapter 18: Staying Motivated to Succeed 243

If your manager isn’t available, ask your manager and coworkers
for references. You want a coach who is passionate about your suc-
cess. She must be able to take your short- and long-term objectives
and connect them to your goals and dreams. Then she needs to
teach you new behaviors and actions that help guide you and hold
you accountable so your results change.
When looking for a coach, you want someone who has a system of
coaching that is action- and activity-based. It can’t all be theory
oriented either. Ask to talk about the program’s core components.
Keep the following in mind to help you narrow your selection:
 Get a test drive session. Any coach worth his salt will want to
spend time with you to really evaluate your situation so he
knows with certainty that together you can achieve results.
 Check the coaching company’s experience. More and more
coaches and coaching companies enter the field daily. Make
sure you get a coach who has experience in your field. For
example, we have been coaching salespeople for almost ten
years at Sales Champions.
 Check yourself. You play a role in the success of coaching.
Are you ready to go to the next level and willing to put forth
the effort? Answer the following three questions to determine
whether you’re ready to work with a coach:
• Do you want to do better? I don’t mean hope, wish, or
dream to do better like you wish to win the lottery. I mean
do you want to do better. Do you have desire that will
translate to action? Improving takes a lot of hard work.
• Are you willing to change? You have to change for
things to change for you. If you don’t want to or won’t
change, your sales numbers, income, and quality of life
won’t change.
• Are you willing to receive, accept, and implement the
advice? In other words, are you coachable? Would you
let another person that is an expert guide you to success,
or are you the type of person that wants to go it alone?
If you can’t affirmatively answer the questions with enthusi-
asm, you may want to approach the opportunity of hiring a
coach with extra caution. You could hire the best in the world
at coaching, but the results may fall short of your expectations
because you’re not truly committed.

Ten (Or So) Ways to Sound
Like a Pro on the Phone
In This Chapter
 Using your voice as an instrument
 Putting in the pre-phone work to score winning calls
Just because the person on the other end of the phone can’t see
you doesn’t mean your image doesn’t come across loud and
clear. When you sound professional, you’re seen as a professional —
even if the prospect never meets you. Conveying that image takes
a little more than dressing for success. This chapter can help you
be the professional that you are.
Always Use a Headset
The act of putting on a headset is a psychological trigger to pre-
pare for business — it’s game time! A headset also frees your
hands so you can take notes. By making a record of important
information, you’re better set to confirm, review, summarize, and
follow up on all critical points.
And when you’re not concentrating on keeping the receiver between
your ear and shoulder, you’re free to focus on the prospect. Using a
headset also reduces neck fatigue and eliminates the risk of drop-
ping the phone while talking to a prospect — blasting the prospect’s
eardrum with a thud on the desktop is not professional.
Stand Up and Be Heard
Ever notice that singers always stand when they perform? That’s
no coincidence. They know that their voice carries more reso-
nance, range, and power when their diaphragm isn’t folded over.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
248
You can use the singers’ secret for sounding more authoritative
and self-assured when speaking to prospects on the phone. Stand
tall and observe the energy and enthusiasm that pours forth.
Slump into your desk in a question-mark curve, and feel the convic-
tion (or lack thereof) seep out of your voice.
Spice Up Your Delivery
In order to keep your prospect’s attention, don’t put him to sleep.
Avoid speaking in a flat monotone voice — instead, vary the deliv-
ery of your speech to grab attention. Play with the following three
vocal elements to vary your speech:
 Tune into your tone. Your speaking voice consists of several
qualities, including rhythm, intonation, and inflection, result-
ing in a one-of-a-kind vocal personality that distinguishes
Jimmy Stewart from Pee Wee Herman. I refer to this vocal fin-
gerprint as tone. Although your tone is what makes your voice
yours, you can optimize your phone communication by paying
some attention to it. Make sure your tone conveys the mes-
sage you want it to.
 Play with the volume. I’m not talking about the volume on
your headset, but the decibel of your own voice. Talk too qui-
etly, and you generate lots of “Could you repeat that?”
requests. Speak too loudly, and the prospect must hold the
receiver at arm’s length. Keep your volume within a reason-
able range, but be sure to vary it to hold the prospect’s atten-
tion and emphasize key points.
 Mix up the pace. Most telephone salespeople are guilty of
speed talking. Chalk it up to enthusiasm, nervousness, or
desire to get in the sales points before the recipient hangs up.
At any rate, you want to avoid this sport. Slow talking can be
just as bad — you’ll have people wanting to finish your sen-
tences for you. Moderate the pace of your speech, occasionally
varying it for effect or emphasis.
Talk Less . . . Listen More
The more you listen to others talk, the more you find out about
them. If you do all the talking, you’re not going to hear anything
you don’t already know.
Start by asking a question or two and then let the other person
talk. Tune in to discover more about the prospect, the company, its
needs, and its priorities and values. You just may find that by
giving the prospect a chance to talk, you discover the best way to

Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Ways to Sound Like a Pro on the Phone 249
answer those needs and meet those priorities and values. And as a
bonus, the prospect hangs up marveling at how smart and knowl-
edgeable you are! (For more on listening, check out Chapter 11.)
Limber Up Your Body
To sound better and be more effective in telephone sales, do some
warm-up exercises to limber and loosen your body. Trust me, you
may spend a good part of your day connected to clients by voice
only, but telephone sales is a full-contact sport!
Do facial exercises before your first call. Tighten and then relax
your face muscles, and clench and relax your teeth several times.
Slowly yawn to limber up your cheeks, muscles, and skin. Balloon
out your cheeks a few times. Loosen your neck and shoulders by
shrugging and relaxing. Rotate your neck slowly to loosen the mus-
cles. A few full-body stretches aren’t a bad idea either. Stretch your
quads, hamstrings, and calves as if you were preparing for a run.
Warm Up Your Voice
Your voice, like your body (see preceding section), needs warming
up to perform at its best. Start out in the shower by humming a
tune (no matter what others in the household may say about your
operatic potential). Humming is an outstanding warm-up for your
vocal chords. For that matter, croaking like a frog is another excel-
lent vibration exercise to strengthen your chords.
Get some talk time in before your first sales call. Synchronize
dinner plans with your spouse. Ask the kids what’s on tap for their
day. Chat with a coworker at the water cooler. And as a bonus, you
may just warm up a few relationships, too.
Put In Pre-Call Practice Time
Every salesperson benefits from rehearsing base scripts and dia-
logues before picking up the phone. I recommend at least 15 min-
utes of practice before each calling session. Doing the drill out
loud is preferable. Don’t be put off by teasing colleagues — they
won’t be laughing when you lead the sales board soon. Practice it
all: your opening statements, prospecting scripts and dialogues,
appointment objection handling, lead follow-up scripts, and closes.

Sneaking in a follow-up practice session at the end of the day doesn’t
hurt. Find a supportive coworker, supervisor, or friend to work with
you. If you put in the time regularly to improve your phone-sales
skills, you’re sure to come across in any phone conversation as the
consummate professional you are.
Bundle Your Calls
For maximum effect and optimal impact, plan your call schedule to
group calls by type. For example, make all prospecting calls within
one block of time such as the first two hours of the morning, and
then follow with a session devoted to lead follow-up calls.
Make at least ten like calls in a row. By focusing on a type, you find
yourself more “in the zone,” zeroed in on the skills and strengths
you need to tap into for a successful call outcome. And as you tick
off the calls, one by one, you find that with each call, you get
better.
Tape and Replay Your Calls
Not only do you create a reliable record of the phone conversation
when you tape your calls — one that you can refer back to as often
as you need to — you also create a valuable tool for self-evaluation.
Did you speak too fast? Talk too much? Sound too aggressive? Come
across as unprepared? Hear yourself as your prospect hears you,
and you’re bound to discover ways that you can improve and fine-
tune your sales skills on the phone.

Ten Phrases to Banish from
Your Vocabulary
In This Chapter
 Avoiding phrases that lead to dead ends
 Eliminating statements that send up defenses
A
chieving success as a telephone salesperson is as much
about what you don’t say as it is about saying the right thing.
You’ll have times when you’re best not to talk at all — listening to
the prospect often results in key information that can help you
make the sale (more on this in Chapter 11). And when you do have
the floor (or the phone, as the case may be), you want to be aware
of certain words and phrases that seem to halt communication
rather than further it along in the direction you want. Consider the
ten questions, words, or phrases in this chapter taboo for the tele-
phone salesperson.
“Do You Have Time to Talk?”
Asking someone if they have time to talk is probably the worst way
to open a sales call. Of course, you want to be respectful of an indi-
vidual’s time, but you can utilize more-effective ways of conveying
that courtesy without giving the prospect an open invitation to 
say no.
A couple effective examples to determine whether the prospect
has time include the following:
“I recognize that you have objectives for the day, so I will be brief.”
“I’m aware of your time constraints, so I will get to the point
quickly.”

(Read Chapter 9 for plenty of ideas on how to start a successful
sales call.)
“I Sent You Some Material, and I
Was Wondering if You Got It.”
This statement is a dead end. A common sales tactic is to mail cold
leads some information with the intent of “warming up” the
prospect. This tactic is rarely effective. If you’re contacting a busi-
ness client, chances are good that the mailing didn’t make it past
an assistant or secretary. So that leaves you summoning up a big,
fat no response. And what can you say to that?
Even if the prospect has received the material, you run the risk
that she passed it on to someone else — or tossed it. In any sce-
nario, your chances of launching conversation in a positive direc-
tion are slim. Expect responses such as, “I don’t know, maybe,” or
“Yeah, I think I passed it on.” Not the promising start you’d like.
You’re better off to begin with a more direct approach, such as
“Bob, this is Fred Smith with ABC Window, the reason for my call 
is . . .” rather than tossing away control of the conversation’s 
direction.
“I’ll Send You Another.”
I call this the “Play-it-again, Sam” approach. Salespeople typically
pull out this phrase when they open with the equally ineffective
“Did you receive my materials?” opening (see the preceding sec-
tion). Talk about a wasted effort! Chances are, this follow-up mail-
ing will suffer the same fate as the first one.
Before you offer to resend the information, first confirm that you’re
offering the prospect something that she’s interested in. For exam-
ple, you can say something like:
“I know that you’re time crunched as well as I am. Would you
have an interest in exploring . . .”
“If I sent you our brochure, you would have it on Thursday. Would
you have enough time to review it before we booked an appoint-
ment to speak for the middle or the end of next week?”
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
252

“You Wouldn’t Want a _____,
Would You?”
Place anything in the blank: “a new copy machine,” “to list your
home,” “to review your life insurance,” or “to hear about our new
cable packages.” However, using the negative assumption results in
a negative outcome. This phrase practically begs the prospect to
say no.
The salesperson who uses it demonstrates a total lack of confi-
dence or belief in the product or service — not a rousing endorse-
ment for the prospect to listen further. Toss this question out and
expect to hear a no — or the click of the receiver.
“But . . . ”
But seems like such a harmless little word, thrown into your dia-
logue simply to connect one thought to the next. But . . . this
innocuous three-letter word serves as a secret code to a prospect:
It reveals that you’re about to manipulate him. Of course, that may
not be your intention at all. Consider how these common expres-
sions can be misleading due to the but:
 I can appreciate your views, but . . .
 I understand your concerns, but . . .
No matter what words you choose to follow but, the prospect hears
something like the following:
 I can appreciate your views, but you’re wrong.
 I understand your concerns, but I’m going to manipulate you
into buying my product anyway.
There you go, trying to be understanding and nice, and that but
negates all your efforts.
If you use contrast and comparison in selling — and I highly
recommend that you do — you want to replace but with a more
positive link. Choose and, which permits the prospect to form his
own conclusion. (Check out Chapter 13 for more on overcoming
objections.) In addition to but, don’t use other similar words, such
as however, yet, still, notwithstanding, nevertheless, be that as it may,
all the same, or but’s uncultured cousin, yeah, but.
Chapter 20: Ten Phrases to Banish from Your Vocabulary 253

“You’re Wrong.”
Your prospects secure information about your company from
many sources, including friends, business associates, competitors,
and media. Frequently, their information is incorrect. Perhaps they
have a partial story or the story that your competitors want to
convey. Jumping in to tell them they’re wrong isn’t the way to disa-
buse them of their inaccurate beliefs.
A better approach is to encourage the prospect to share as much
detail as possible about her concerns. Ask questions, let her talk,
and try to find out the source of the misinformation. Try these
phrases to uncover the source:
“That’s interesting; I have not heard that. Can you tell me where
you heard that?”
“I try to keep a pulse on the industry and its developments. It
sounds like you have insider information. Can you share it?”
By allowing the prospect to talk rather than blasting her with a
strong denial, you validate her perspective — and you discover the
source of the misinformation. After you know where the story
came from, you’re likely to have an easier time turning the tide.
“We’ve Always Had a Challenge
with that Department.”
Revealing the company’s dirty laundry in hopes of deflecting
blame doesn’t work with the customers. You may be tempted to
play good cop/bad cop with other representatives or departments
in your company — especially if the prospect has raised a criti-
cism. But you’re a team. If one area of your company lets the client
down, you fail, as well.
You want to be an internal advocate, both for the sake of your com-
pany’s reputation and for fostering confidence in your client and
building a respectful relationship. Blaming another department
may get you off the hook on a personal basis, but most people
won’t continue to do business if the service department “always”
poses challenges — even if you are such an upfront person!
Rather than pointing the finger somewhere else, take responsibility
for the customer’s dissatisfaction and commit to resolving the situ-
ation to the best of your availability. If the situation is bad, and you
know that your company can’t deliver as promised, adjust the time
frame or conditions so it can follow through.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
254

“I’m Calling Because We 
Have a New _____.”
Similar to the knee-jerk-no response (see the first statement in this
chapter), this phrase triggers a reflex reaction, as well. By alerting
the prospect that you’re planning to pedal a new whatever, he is
already formulating a don’t-need-it or already-have-one reply.
Instead of giving the prospect a shortcut to no, lead with the bene-
fits of your product. You’re not selling the latest, greatest, new, and
improved version of a cheese slicer; you’re offering the prospect a
way to make dinner parties a roaring success and reduce time
spent preparing the meal.
“I’ll Let You Get Back to Work”
This phrase, along with its close cousin “I won’t take up any more
of your time,” denigrates the value of what you do by implying
your sales call isn’t really work or worth as much attention as the
prospect’s other work. You’re offering an important product or
service — one that may stimulate sales, decrease costs, improve
customer service, retain employees, build morale, and increase
productivity. That prospect is most certainly, from both of your
perspectives, worth the investment of time.
Instead of closing with a statement like this, simply end the call
with, “Thank you so much for your time.”
“You Maintain . . .”, “You 
Think . . .”, and So On
Statements such as these send up an alarm to your call recipients —
kind of like those air-raid whines in old World War II movies, warning
of an enemy attack. And the prospects do the same thing those
citizens did in the movies — they run for shelter.
Their defense strategy may involve shutting down, clamming up,
or, in some cases, launching an attack. Keep the following types of
phrases (and similar ones) out of your sales calls:
 You claim
 You omitted
Chapter 20: Ten Phrases to Banish from Your Vocabulary 255

 You forgot
 You overlooked
 You don’t understand
 We must have
 You should
When prospects feel challenged, cornered, offended, or threatened,
you can expect them to fight back and — no surprise — annihilate
the possibility of a sale.
Rather, you want to use softer approaches to point out an error or
point of confusion, such as
“I must not be hearing you correctly; can we explore this further.”
“I am confused, so can we spend a few minutes so I am clear.”
“I must not be as effective as I hoped in communicating our
recommendations to you; let me try again.”

Ten (Or So) Actions That
Promote Phone-Sales
Success
In This Chapter
 Organizing day, time, and place for peak performance
 Establishing good habits for a lifetime of phone-sales success
I
n order to achieve long-term success in any endeavor, you need
to build a foundation of positive practices and productive habits.
Just as saving money steadily in small increments adds up to a for-
tune over time, performing small actions weekly — or even daily —
results in a wealth of career achievement. This chapter touches on
nine things you can do to encourage success in your phone sales.
Create a Positive Workspace
Environment plays a huge role in shaping your success, so make
your workspace comfortable. You want a workspace that feeds
your attitude and nourishes your self-confidence. Your surround-
ings influence your attitude, motivation, and performance. A dank,
dark, cluttered burrow of an office can translate into a confined
outlook and limited vision. On the other hand, a clean, open, well-
lit space can inspire optimism and clarity of purpose.
To create a positive workspace, keep the following pointers in mind:
 Bring in pictures and possessions that make you smile and
establish a positive mood.
 Stock the shelves with books that give you a lift. Words of
inspiration can transform doubt and discouragement into
renewed exuberance.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
258
 Use the walls of your space, as well. Hang up meaningful
quotes and motivational passages, so you can turn to them
easily for a regular reminder of your potential. Recycle the
quotes every few weeks to refresh your focus. And leave
space on your walls for your sales scripts, objection-handling
scripts, and closing scripts. Having these important tools
close at hand helps boost your self-assuredness.
Time Block Your Day
Time blocking — identifying and scheduling priority tasks or activi-
ties on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis — is the one skill that
top salespeople hear from their clients as the most life-changing in
terms of developing habits of success.
The level of your achievement — whether measured in terms of
income, fame, career advancement, or emotional well-being — is
directly connected to the mastery of time blocking. When you zero
in on what really matters to you and guarantee that it gets done by
putting it on your schedule, you find that those “fires” and “clus-
ters” and inconsequential issues that steal your time no longer get
in the way of the values you hold most dear.
When time blocking your schedule, consider the ebb and flow of
your workday and periods of peak activity for your business. You
wouldn’t want to set aside time for sales calls when you’re not fully
alert or energized, nor do you want to contact clients during a
period that they’re typically tied up in other matters. (Check out
Chapter 7 for more info.)
Play Early Bird and Night Owl
In order to be a top salesperson, you may need to put in extra
hours and come in early and stay late. Although life balance is as
critical to salespeople as it is to everyone else, sometimes you may
need to devote more time and energy to your job as a salesperson.
For example, if you’re new to the field or new to a company, you
need to get up to speed on your job and your employer’s way of
working. Or perhaps your industry has been hit with a change that
makes sales more challenging. You need to put in the extra time to
maintain the status quo. Or maybe you want to take your success
to the next level, whether you’re after a promotion, a raise, or
increased sales. Coming in early and staying late can help.

Chapter 21: Ten (Or So) Actions That Promote Phone-Sales Success 259
When I was new to sales, all I had going for me was effort. I certainly
didn’t have skills, so my only hope to move up was to outwork
everyone else. I arrived by 7 a.m. — most of my fellow salespeople
didn’t come in until after 9 a.m. I stayed until 6 p.m. or later. I was
willing to pay a short-term price for long-term success.
I don’t propose that you put in 60-, 70-, or 80-hour weeks as a rule.
But it can pay off to shoot for somewhere between 50 and 55 hours
a week. Consider the extra time you put into your job an invest-
ment of 25-percent increased time — for a long-range payoff.
Become a Lifelong Learner
Make an ongoing investment in your own personal development.
Just as today’s dollar won’t buy as much in 20 years, your current
level of knowledge won’t buy you as high an income level down the
road. Consider the need to learn more and acquire more knowl-
edge because of the ever-changing and competitive world we live
in education inflation.
Take the classes, check out the books, play the CDs and DVDs, enroll
in the seminars, and hire the coaches necessary to keep you on the
learning track.
Don’t rely on your company to guide you in the acquisition of skills
and knowledge. You’re the CEO of your own life, and if you want to
be more successful, you have to be perceived as more valuable —
and the best way to increase your value is to gain more knowledge.
Prepare for Each Call
Just as you plan for your time on a daily, weekly, and monthly
basis, preparing for each individual sales call is equally as vital.
Sure, you may make so many calls a day, and you could do them in
your sleep. But taking just a minute or two to get yourself up to
speed can increase your productivity tenfold. (Chapter 4 can help
you plan for each call.)
Depending on the type of call, here are some questions to answer
before dialing the next number:
 Initial call: Do you have all the background information you
need?
 Follow-up call: What step of the sales process are you at and
are you prepared for it? Where was the conversation left? Did
you commit to some follow-up action? Is it done?

 Sales presentation call: Have you practiced your script?
Rehearsed responses to objections? Role-played the close?
Always Ask for Commitment
No one — not even the consummate telephone salesperson —
makes a sale with every phone call. But you can’t count on com-
mitment without asking for it. Top salespeople always ask. A top
salesperson doesn’t leave it up to the prospect to offer.
That said, you can still gain some level of commitment — even if
it’s a low level of commitment. Maybe the prospect agrees to
review the information you sent. Perhaps she commits to accept-
ing a follow-up call down the road. Use questions such as “If I send
you the literature, will you review it?” or “It seems that I have
answered all your questions, correct?” (Chapter 14 gives the com-
plete lowdown on asking for commitment.)
Respect the Threshold Moment
Almost every sales call holds a threshold moment — the point in
which you become aware that the sale will or won’t be made. If the
signs say the deal is near-done, then congratulations! Move into
wrap-up mode.
But when the call begins to apex in the down direction, resist the
urge to keep the prospect on in hopes of flipping him from “no” to
“go.” All you’re doing is reducing the number of calls, contacts, and
sales you make today. And your efforts to raise a sale from the
dead may just irk the prospect into avoiding you for the hereafter.
A negative threshold moment doesn’t mean a sale won’t happen,
but it does mean it won’t happen on that call. After you recognize
that moment, wrap up and get off the phone — in minutes.
Review Each Call
Before you move on to the next name on your call list, wrap up the
previous call. Evaluate the call you just completed: Did you pick up
any new nuggets about what they want, such as who you’re com-
peting against, their timeframe to make a decision, or their service
expectations in their decision-making process? If you went through
all these points, make sure all the details are in your notes.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
260

Then, review your performance. What went well with your delivery?
What did you stumble over? Did you allow the prospect to do the
talking while you listened? Did you struggle over any objections?
What changes or tweaks do you need to make to your delivery?
Finally, make notes of those actions you want to take to your pres-
entation. And, most important, schedule any follow-up action you
committed to!
Persistence Pays Off
As a salesperson, you’re going to face rejections again and again. In
order to achieve success, you can’t be dissuaded by this bad news.
You have to remain persistent with the prospect and keep on trying.
(You can find more on capitalizing on rejection in Chapter 15.)
Here’s a statistic for you: 60 percent of all sales are made after the
prospect has said no four times. But how many salespeople
weather through four rejections and still pursue the business?
Here’s the skinny:
 Forty-four percent of salespeople give up after the first no.
 Twenty-two percent call it quits after hearing the second no.
 Fourteen percent throw in the towel with the third no.
 Twelve percent move on after the fourth no.
 And the 8 percent left who hang tough? They’re the ones who
garner that 60 percent of the sales business out there — and
all just because they keep at it.
You can’t find a substitute for persistence. Talent, skill, attitude,
products, service, and marketing support — all are important in
order to achieve winning results. But perseverance of spirit is what
keeps a salesperson on the road to success. Working with a
prospect even after hearing no four times, making your daily quota
of cold calls or lead follow-ups every day, and staying in touch with
a prospect even after he’s given his business to someone else are
all valuable efforts that pay off in sales success.
