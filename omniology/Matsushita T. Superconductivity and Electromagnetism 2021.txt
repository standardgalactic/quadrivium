Preface
Today, MRI systems with superconducting magnets are commonly used in hospitals,
andcommercialsuperconductinglinearmaglevtrainsthatconnectTokyoandNagoya
in Japan in 40 min are scheduled to start in 2027. Thus, superconductivity has become
well-known. In addition, it is known by people who are interested in our global
environmental problems that the introduction of superconducting instruments and
power cables has great potential to contribute to suppression of CO2 emissions.
Superconductivity is a peculiar phenomenon in which electrical resistance disap-
pears when a superconducting material is cooled down to very low temperatures.
Thus, it has been investigated for a long time in solid-state physics, and many scien-
tists have received Nobel prizes for work based on superconductivity. For example,
the idea of symmetry breaking in the ﬁeld of elementary physics by Dr. Youichiro
Nanbu was derived from the theory of superconductivity.
Thus, the phenomenon of superconductivity may seem to be special. Even so,
almost half of all elements show superconductivity. This means that superconduc-
tors are not minor substances. In addition, the E-B analogy, the main principle in
present electromagnetism, can be made more rigorous by the introduction of super-
conductivity into Maxwell’s theory, which was completed before the discovery of
superconductivity. In other words, the existence of substances with zero resistivity,
i.e., superconductors, could have been predicted in the 19th century.
Electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors can be described by ﬁrst prin-
ciples that assume the minimization of the relevant energy, since the phenomenon
is reversible because of zero resistivity. On the other hand, irreversible phenomena
such as electrical resistivity can be easily found in the world. The mechanism of
irreversibility has not yet been proved theoretically. In this sense, superconduc-
tors are pure materials from the viewpoint of physics. Even so, the electromagnetic
phenomena in superconducting wires used for electric power instruments, etc. are
irreversible. This irreversible nature is largely different from irreversible phenomena
such as electrical resistance in normal metals but similar to friction: When an object
does not move due to friction under a driving force, there is no energy dissipation. If
a driving force that exceeds the friction moves the object, energy dissipation occurs.

Preface
The situation is similar in superconductors. When a constant direct current ﬂows in
a superconductor and quantized magnetic ﬂux lines do not move, there is no energy
dissipation, but when an alternating current ﬂows or when an alternating magnetic
ﬁeld is applied, quantized magnetic ﬂux lines move, and energy is dissipated in the
superconductor. In particular, the loss energy in a unit cycle of applied AC magnetic
ﬁeld is independent of the frequency, and the loss is iron type in nature. Since the loss
energy is proportional to the area of the closed magnetization curve, this is called
hysteresis loss. On the other hand, the loss energy in most metals is copper type and
proportional to the frequency. The irreversibility associated with the copper-type
loss comes from the breaking of time reversal symmetry of the equation of motion,
although the mechanism has not yet been proved theoretically.
The irreversibility in superconductors can be proved theoretically, as shown in
this book. Then, the force balance equation used in the phenomenological critical
state model that describes irreversible phenomena in superconductors can be derived
using ﬁrst principles. Here it should be noted that the ﬂux pinning that is respon-
sible for hysteresis losses originates from the interaction between ﬂux lines and
pinning potentials. Hence, this interaction is essentially reversible in nature. In fact,
if we watch carefully, reversible electromagnetic phenomena can be observed. It
is also proved that, if the displacement of ﬂux lines exceeds a reversible regime,
the phenomena become irreversible. The essence of the irreversibility in the critical
state in superconductors can be summarized by the statement that the force of defects
works to prevent ﬂux lines from being driven by the Lorentz force. This results from a
biased statistical distribution of ﬂux lines inside innumerable potentials in the super-
conductor. A certain phenomenon, i.e., an instability of ﬂux motion in a pinning
potential well, is inevitable for realization of the biased distribution, as shown in this
book. This is quite analogous to friction and hysteresis in ferromagnetic materials.
In this sense, it can be said that theoretical understanding on irreversibility is slightly
advanced in the ﬁeld of superconductivity.
In addition, it can be emphasized that a certain electromagnetic phenomenon
in superconductors is not widely known. This is the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
effect observed in a current-carrying superconductor in a parallel magnetic ﬁeld.
The peculiarity is represented by a dramatic increase in the critical current density,
i.e., the maximum non-dissipative current density, and the appearance of negative
voltage. It is empirically known that the force-free state (J × B = 0) is achieved
in this ﬁeld conﬁguration. That is, the current density J and the magnetic ﬂux
density B are parallel to each other. Research on this phenomenon started in 1963
and has been conducted on metallic low-temperature superconductors. The high-
temperature superconductors were discovered in 1986; however, and attention of
most researchers was attracted to these new materials. In addition, an appreciable
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect was not observed in high-temperature supercon-
ductors fabricated at that time due to weak-link grain boundaries that disturb current
ﬂow. For this reason, the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect has not been investigated
for a long period, and only small number of researchers know about this effect now.

Preface

The characteristic point of this effect is that the magnetic ﬂux density B and vector
potential A are parallel to each other in the static force-free state. That is, the static
magnetic helicity is not zero in this state. This can be achieved only in supercon-
ductors with zero electrical resistivity. When Maxwell’s theory was completed in
the 19th century, superconductors had not been discovered. Hence, the state with
nonzero static magnetic helicity was not considered during the process of comple-
tion of Maxwell’s theory. In addition, such a peculiar state has not been theoretically
investigated from the viewpoint of electromagnetism. Hence, it is expected that we
can open a new pathway to unknown physics through investigating the peculiar elec-
tromagnetic phenomena in superconductors. One of these new phenomena is the
appearance of a magnetic generalized force, i.e., a torque, in spite of zero Lorentz
force. That is, the driving torque on ﬂux lines is not equal to the moment of the
Lorentz force. The appearance of torque in the condition of no force cannot happen
in dynamics.
The characteristic points of electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors are
brieﬂy introduced here. First, it is shown in this book not only that the diamagnetism
in the superconductors harmonizes with Maxwell’s theory, which was completed
before its discovery, but also that the dominant E-B analogy in the present electro-
magnetism loses perfection without the superconductor. Secondly, it is shown that
the ﬂux pinning that brings about the beneﬁcial feature of non-dissipative current in
DC condition causes special irreversibility in the AC condition. We have proved only
experimentally that if there is no energy dissipation in the superconductor caused by
the breaking of time reversal symmetry, it contradicts the thermodynamic principle
on energy conservation. This is now proved theoretically based on Maxwell’s theory,
since the irreversibility in the superconductor is theoretically derived. Thirdly, the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect that is only known to a small number of researchers
is introduced, and it is shown that this phenomenon leads to a new development of
Maxwell’s theory. Thus, the electromagnetic phenomena in the superconductor are
deeply associated with electromagnetism over a wide range from the primary level
to new profound matters. The validity of Maxwell’s theory for all of them will be
clariﬁed in this book.
This book will be recommended to people who are interested in science, especially
in superconductivity. It seems to be enough to read Chaps. 1–3 to gain knowledge
over a wide area. If the relationship with other related phenomena such as friction
or the application of superconductors in the future is interesting, Chap. 7 will also
be useful.
All of this book is recommended as an introduction to students or young scientists
who are interested in applied superconductivity, especially in power applications.
Then, if they are interested in practical electromagnetic phenomena such as ﬂux
pinning mechanisms and ﬂux creep in superconductors, it is desirable to move to
more technical books.
Many appendices will help the readers to understand the methods of derivation
of the equations. These will also be useful to clarify this particular way of thinking.

Introduction
1.1
Superconductor
Superconductors, the materials that can carry a current without electric resistance,
may be unfamiliar to people. This is because the superconducting state can be realized
only at very low temperatures. It is necessary to cool down a superconductor with
liquid nitrogen at 196 °C to realize the superconducting state, even for the “high-
temperature superconductors” discovered in 1986. There is no material that achieves
superconductivity at room temperature. Thus, superconductors are usually placed
within special metallic containers to keep their temperatures low, and hence, people
seldom see them. Superconducting wires are fabricated to carry current, and some
of them are shown in Fig. 1.1.
The role that superconductors play is now gradually increasing around the world.
For example, electromagnets in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems that
physicians sometimes use in medical examinations are made of superconducting
wires (see Fig. 1.2). The Central Japan Railway Company is planning to connect
Shinagawa in Tokyo and Nagoya, which are separated by 285.6 km, with a 40 min
journey on a Superconducting Magnetic Levitated (SCMAGLEV) Train by the
latter half of the 2020s (see Fig. 1.3). Superconducting magnets are used to levi-
tate and drive the train at very high speed. The prediction of the Higgs boson was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013. The highly developed Japanese tech-
nology of superconducting magnets that compose particle accelerators supported
the successful observation of the Higgs boson. Large-scale integrated circuits (LSI)
are now installed in various devices such as computers and home electrical appli-
ances. Large single crystals of high-purity silicon for LSI cannot be made without
strong magnetic ﬁelds produced by superconducting magnets. Such a wide variety of
applications for superconducting magnets are owing to their property of no electrical
resistance. For example, the very strong magnetic ﬁeld produced by superconducting
magnets is useful to levitate heavy trains or to prevent hot melted silicon from moving
by convection and introducing impurities. For MRI, a very stable magnetic ﬁeld is a
key point.

Superconductivity is a peculiar phenomenon in solid state physics. For this reason,
almost half a century was needed for solution to the mechanism of superconductivity
after its discovery in 1911. In the meanwhile, the theory of quantum mechanics was
completed in the 1920s. The great physicists who contributed to the development
of quantum mechanics could not solve the problem of superconductivity. This was
because the appearance of superconductivity was contradictory to the Pauli exclusion
principle based on symmetry of the wave functions of particles. Superconductivity is
a phenomenon of electrons that carry non-dissipative current. The superconducting
state was speculated to be one of condensed states in which many electrons stay in
the same state with the same energy. Such a state is only achieved, however, for Bose

A long time was needed to solve this problem. It was clariﬁed by Bardeen, Cooper,
and Schrieffer in 1957 that superconductivity occurs by the formation of pairs of
electrons, which behave similarly to Bose particles. This is called pair condensation.
Based on this discovery, it was predicted that liquid 3He composed of two protons
and one neutron, which is a Fermi particle, would achieve superﬂuidity without
viscosity, in a similar way to liquid 4He containing two neutrons, which is a Bose
particle. This prediction was experimentally proved later. Thus, solid state physics
was signiﬁcantly advanced by the solution of the mechanism of superconductivity
in the 20th century.
In spite of such a complicated mechanism, almost half of the elements show
superconductivity if cooled sufﬁciently, including under high pressure conditions or
inthinﬁlms.Hence,theelementsthatshowsuperconductivityarenotrareandspecial.
Most metallic compounds show superconductivity, and some organic compounds do
also. Some insulating materials also become superconducting on the introduction of
a small amount of carriers. Thus, we can say that superconductors are common.
Magnetic materials are commonly used substances with magnetic moment.
Among them, the ferromagnetic materials that are used for permanent magnets lose
their ferromagnetic property when heated above the Curie temperature due to the
now random orientation of magnetic moments. This is a kind of phase transition
similar to the change of ice to water when heated above 0 °C. When the temperature
of a superconductor is increased above the critical temperature, the superconducting
state with zero resistivity turns into the normal state with resistivity. A similar phase

Introduction
transition occurs in ferroelectric materials, which are a type of electric materials.
Thus, the superconducting transition can be regarded as just one of the general phase
transitions, and its one exceptional point is a very low transition temperature. If a
room temperature superconductor is discovered in the future, the idea of peculiarity
will be weakened. Recently, it was discovered that H3S became superconducting at
203 K (−70 ◦C) under a very high pressure of 155 million atm. In addition, LaH10
showed superconductivity at 250–260 K (−23 to −13 ◦C) under a similar high pres-
sure. These discoveries create the strong impression that the discovery of a room
temperature superconductor is not a pipe dream.
1.2
Zero Electrical Resistance
Here we discuss the zero resistivity, which is the most outstanding property of a
superconductor, from various aspects. Firstly, the zero resistivity is proved theoreti-
cally. Then, we try to check if it is possible to prove it experimentally. It is necessary
to measure the voltage drop V across a specimen when a current I is applied to it.
The resistance is obtained as R = V/I. This measurement is applied to a square rod
made of high purity copper with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm2 and length of 10 cm
that has been cooled down to liquid helium temperature −269 °C. The electrical
resistivity ρr of pure copper at this temperature is about 1 × 10−11 m, and the elec-
trical resistance is estimated from Ohm’s law as R = ρrl/S = 1 × 10−6 [], where l
and S are the length and cross-sectional area, respectively. Hence, when a current of
1 A is applied, the potential drop is 1 µV

= 1 × 10−6 V

. Thus, the measurement is
possible. When the electrical resistivity is smaller by two orders in magnitude, the
measurement is difﬁcult due to the noise in the voltmeter. That is, it is difﬁcult to
measure a resistivity smaller than 1×10−13 m by this measurement method. Thus,
it is impossible to prove the zero resistivity in superconductors.
Then, we try to measure the resistivity by another method. We assume a closed
circle 10 cm in diameter (D) made of a round wire 1 mm in diameter (d). The electrical
resistance of this closed circle is R = 4ρrD/d2 and the self-inductance1 is
L ∼= μ0D

is the magnetic permeability of vacuum, the unit of
the inductance H is the Henry, and N in the magnetic permeability is the Newton.
When a current is induced in the closed loop by magnetic induction, the current
decays with time t as

circuit. The coefﬁcient L = /I is the self-inductance.

where t0 is the time constant given by

(1.3)
Hence, the electrical resistivity can be estimated by measurement of t0. When the
closed loop is made of high purity copper, we have R ∼= 4×10−6  and t0 is estimated
to be 0.11 s. In the case of the usual copper, t0 is below 1/10,000 s.
When this measurement is performed for a superconductor, a decay of the current
is not observed for three years. Hence, we can say that the electrical resistivity of
superconductors is very small. However, it is not possible to prove that the elec-
trical resistivity is exactly zero. If the uncertainty of the measured value of the
decay rate is 10−4, the time constant is estimated to be larger than 30,000 years
∼= 9.5 × 1011 s. Hence, we can say that the electrical resistivity of the supercon-
ductor is below 1 × 10−24 m. Thus, our estimation is limited. A time constant of
over 30,000 years, however, can be regarded as inﬁnity in the time scale of our lives.
Thus, we can substantially regard the electrical resistivity of superconductors as zero.
This is similar to the case where we regard the continents on the earth as stationary,
although they move a few mm in a year.
Secondly, we will consider the physical aspect of electrical resistivity. When
we apply a current to a substance with a ﬁnite electrical resistivity, the electrical
energy changes to heat. The reversal process, however, i.e., a direct change from
heat to electrical energy, is not possible. Although we can obtain 100 Wh of heat
from electrical energy of 100 Wh, the electrical energy obtained from 100 Wh of heat
using a heat engine is fairly small. Thus, the generation of heat by electrical resistance
is an irreversible phenomenon. We know of various other irreversible phenomena.
Spilled water from a glass cannot be brought back into the glass. A drop of ink that
has fallen into water is diffused, but it does not happen that diffused ink coheres to a
point as the time is reversed. Such things occur commonly in our daily life, and we
are accustomed to irreversible phenomena.
Nevertheless, such irreversibility has not been theoretically proved. The essence
of physical phenomena is the equation of motion that describes the movement of
matter. This holds also for the movement of particles in a many body system. The
equation of motion is symmetric with respect to time reversal. This may indicate
that a phenomenon can be reversed like movie ﬁlm run backwards. In reality, most
phenomena are irreversible, and such a reversal does not occur. Electrical resistance is
also one of the irreversible phenomena. When we apply a voltage across a substance
like a metal, electrons are accelerated by the Coulomb force. The motion of the
electrons is interrupted by ions, and the velocity decreases. As a result, the velocity
of electrons is approximately constant under the acceleration and scattering, if aver-
aged over a certain period. Thus, the steady condition of current is fulﬁlled. Electrons
obtain kinetic energy by Coulomb interactions and lose it by the scattering. On the

other hand, ions acquire the kinetic energy of electrons, which leads to heat. It is
possible to derive electrical resistance and Ohm’s law by introducing a phenomeno-
logical viscous force into the equation of motion, although the viscous force has not
been proved theoretically.
Now we go back the superconductor. Since the electrical resistance is zero, the
electromagnetic phenomena in the superconductor can be derived from ﬁrst prin-
ciples, i.e., the minimization of the relevant free energy. First principles cannot be
applied to irreversible phenomena accompanied by energy dissipation. This means
that the superconductor is a pure material in physics.
1.3
Energy Dissipation in Superconductors
In spite of the explanation above, energy dissipation does occur in superconductors
in reality, and electrical resistance appears. Superconductors are used for magnets.
When a superconducting magnet is operated, the superconductor is subject to a
strong magnetic ﬁeld, and the magnetic ﬂux penetrates in the form of quantized
magnetic ﬂux lines, which are simply called ﬂux lines. When a current is applied to
the superconductor that contains ﬂux lines, the Lorentz force works on the ﬂux lines.
If ﬂux lines are driven by the Lorentz force, an electromotive force appears. Since the
central area of 10–100 nm in diameter in each ﬂux line is in the normal state with a
ﬁnite resistivity, normal electrons in this area are driven by the electric ﬁeld, resulting
in energy dissipation. This state is called the ﬂux ﬂow. Hence, defects such as normal
precipitates or grain boundaries are introduced in practical superconductors used for
various devices so that such defects prevent ﬂux lines from moving, even under the
Lorentz force. This effect is called ﬂux pinning and defects that are effective for
this are called pinning centers. Since the Lorentz force is proportional to the current
density, the critical current density, i.e., the maximum non-dissipative current density,
is proportional to the strength of ﬂux pinning.
Energy dissipation does not occur in the superconductor due to the ﬂux pinning
effect, if the current with a density below the critical current density is applied in a
static condition. The ﬂux motion still occurs, however, resulting in energy dissipa-
tion under a condition varying with time such as an alternating current or varying
external magnetic ﬁeld. This is similar to friction. In reality ﬂux pinning interactions
work against the driving force on ﬂux lines and are irreversible in nature. This seems
to be contradictory to the above statement that electromagnetic phenomena can be
derived from ﬁrst principles to minimize the relevant energy. It should be noted,
however, that ﬂux pinning originates from the interaction between ﬂux lines and
the pinning potentials of defects and is reversible in nature. Reversible phenomena
are really observed for very small displacements of ﬂux lines. This corresponds to
a play in friction. The irreversibility appears when displacement exceeds a certain
level of reversibility in both cases. Variation from reversibility to irreversibility takes
place continuously. As will be explained later in this book, therefore, ﬂux pinning

phenomena can be derived from ﬁrst principles. This fact strongly suggests theo-
retically that, if there is not energy dissipation, it contradicts the ﬁrst law of ther-
modynamics. The contradiction has only been pointed out from the experimental
viewpoint. It can be recognized from the above discussion that there are two kinds of
irreversibility: One originates from the breaking of time reversal symmetry, in spite
of the restriction by the common equation of motion, and the other originates from a
difference in the equation between just before and just after unstable motion of ﬂux
lines. The irreversibility in superconductors belongs to the latter type. Thus, the elec-
tromagnetic phenomena in superconductors are deeply associated with fundamental
aspects of physics.
Here, we emphasize a series of special electromagnetic phenomena called the
“longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect” in superconductors. One of them represents a
signiﬁcant increase in the critical current density. The magnetic ﬁeld produced by
a current is directed perpendicular to the current. A longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is a
magnetic ﬁeld applied parallel to a superconducting wire and it is empirically known
that a state in which the local current and the magnetic ﬁeld are parallel to each other
is attained. This state is called the force-free state, since the Lorentz force on the ﬂux
lines is zero. If a simple superposition is assumed for the magnetic ﬁeld between
the applied ﬁeld and the self-ﬁeld of the current, there is no change in the Lorentz
force, resulting in no change in the critical current density. As will be shown later, the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is a quite new electromagnetic phenomenon that
has not been discussed in terms of the usual electromagnetism, and it will add a new
page to electromagnetism. Hence, the introduction of superconductivity is expected
to greatly inﬂuence electromagnetism.
Thus, the electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors are important, not
only from scientiﬁc, but also from technological aspects. Even a primitive perfect
diamagnetism in superconductors is not described in textbooks of electromagnetism,
however. Such a situation should be corrected. In this book it is emphasized how
elementary electromagnetism changes by introducing perfect diamagnetism in super-
conductors. If we reach a conclusion, the analogy between electricity and magnetism
becomes perfectly rigid, just as in the case where a picture of a jigsaw puzzle is
completed by adding a missing piece. Maxwell’s theory was completed in the 19th
century. Although superconductivity had not been discovered at that time, the frame-
work of electromagnetism was compatible with superconductivity, as if it had already
been discovered. Since the zero resistivity is easily derived for a material with perfect
diamagnetism using Maxwell’s equations, it was, in principle, possible to predict the
superconductor in the 19th century, even if it might be an imaginary material.

Introduction
In Chap. 2, the fundamental phenomena of elementary electromagnetism, which
are needed to understand electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors, are brieﬂy
summarized. A special emphasis is placed on describing Maxwell’s equation for
electromagnetic induction, Poynting’s vector, which describes the ﬂow of energy,
etc. These are used in other chapters. It may occur that knowledge on these matters
is required there. Please utilize effectively the knowledge in this chapter in such a
case.
In Chap. 3, the changes that occur in elementary electromagnetism are described,
when the magnetic phenomena in the Meissner state, i.e., perfect diamagnetism,
are introduced. The essential point is that the present E-B analogy becomes more
perfect, when the magnetic phenomena in superconductors satisfying B = 0 is
introduced, which corresponds to the electric phenomena in conductors satisfying
E = 0. The various advantages obtained by this introduction are introduced. It should
be mentioned that, in a substance in which B = 0, the electric resistivity must be
zero. Although this property might be peculiar from the experimental viewpoint, it
can be easily derived from Maxwell’s theory.
In Chap. 4, the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which describes electromagnetic
phenomena in type II superconductors used for various devices, is introduced. Based
on this theory, we study the structure of quantized magnetic ﬂux (the ﬂux line) with
a normal conducting region around the center, which is important in electromagnetic
phenomena in practical superconductors. Because of this structure, electrical resis-
tance appears when ﬂux lines are driven by the Lorentz force arising from current.
On the other hand, this structure contributes to the ﬂux pinning that introduces a
non-dissipative current.
In Chap. 5, the ﬂux pinning mechanism that determines the critical current density,
i.e., the most important parameter for application of superconductors, is introduced.
The pinning interaction between ﬂux lines with spatial structure and defects is orig-
inally reversible with respect to the displacement of ﬂux lines. In fact, reversible
electromagnetic phenomena can be observed within the range of small displacement
of ﬂux lines, if we watch carefully, although practical phenomena are mostly irre-
versible. The irreversible phenomena can be described using the critical state model
that assumes the critical current density as a parameter. Magnetization and AC losses
are introduced, for example, as phenomena that can be explained by the critical state
model. On the other hand, a theory that estimates the critical current density caused
by pinning centers, which is called the summation theory, is reviewed from the
aspect of historical development. Summation theory that uses a statistical method is
also useful to explain a change from reversible to irreversible phenomena. Based on
this knowledge, the basic force-balance equation in the critical state model is derived
using ﬁrst principles for the reversible case, and it is extended to the irreversible case.
As a result, the theory that describes the critical state can be obtained. In addition,
it is shown that the pinning loss power density calculated using a method equiva-
lent to the statistical method in the summation theory agrees with the prediction of
the critical state model. Thus, two theories on the ﬂux pinning, i.e., the summation
theory and the critical state theory, are uniﬁed. The argument is also discussed that

the irreversibility in the ﬂux pinning phenomena does not originate from the breaking
of time-reversal symmetry but from a special mechanism.
In Chap. 6, the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is introduced as a peculiar elec-
tromagnetic phenomenon in a current-carrying superconductor in a parallel magnetic
ﬁeld. It is well known that the force-free state, i.e., the state with zero Lorentz force
because the current and magnetic ﬂux are parallel to each other, is established in
the superconductor. In this conﬁguration of magnetic ﬁeld and current, the critical
current density takes on a much larger value than in the usual transverse magnetic
ﬁeld, and Josephson’s formula for electric ﬁeld E = B × v does not hold, where B
and v are the magnetic ﬂux density and velocity of the ﬂux lines, respectively. The
ﬂux line lattice has a characteristic distortion, i.e., the force-free strain, in the force-
free state, and it is speculated that the driving torque works on ﬂux lines to release
the distortion in a similar way to the Lorentz force. The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
effect is explained comprehensively from the balance between the driving torque
and the pinning torque that works to keep the distortion. The driving torque can be
derived from the energy that penetrates the superconductor when the force-free strain
is introduced. If we assume that the force-free torque does not exist, it results in a
violation of the principle of energy conservation. The important thing is that the ﬂux
pinning plays an essential role in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect. If there is no
pinning effect, the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect does not appear.
In Chap. 7, the essence of this book is summarized, and we look over the position
that electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors occupy in the present ﬁeld of
electromagnetism. In addition, we also discuss what kind of progress is expected
in science in the future, based on the above argument. On the other hand, the most
attractive point of superconductivity is its technological applications. In this chapter
the present status and future possibility of applications in the medical, environmental,
trafﬁc, and energy ﬁelds are brieﬂy introduced.
Some topics are given in the “Coffee break” column at the end of each chapter.

Superconducting oxygen
Oxygen is a chemical element that occupies about 21% of the air on Earth. It is
also a common element of the third largest mass fraction in the universe following
hydrogen and helium. Oxygen also shows superconductivity. It is one of the most
difﬁcult elements, however, to reach superconductivity. Oxygen is condensed to a
liquid at 90.2 K and becomes a bluish solid at 54.8 K. The crystalline oxygen has a
cubic structure and has a metallic sheen under the very high pressure of one million
atmospheres. The transition to the superconducting state is realized at the extremely
low temperature of 0.6 K under 1.25 million atmospheres.

Chapter 2
Basic Electromagnetism
Abstract In this chapter we summarize the essential principles associated with elec-
trostatic and magnetic phenomena caused by electric charges and currents, respec-
tively, based on the E-B analogy. These are necessary to understand the usefulness of
introducing superconductivity into electromagnetism, which will be done in Chap. 3.
Poynting’s vector, which will be used to discuss the ﬂow of energy in other chapters,
is also described. It is recommended that readers who have not studied electromag-
netism for many years read this chapter before proceeding to the next chapter. Since
this chapter is compactly summarized, it will be actively utilized further on.
2.1
Electrostatic Phenomena
Here we treat electrostatic phenomena that do not change with time. The source
that causes various kinds of electric phenomena is electric charge, and there are two
kinds of electric charge. One is the electric charge that ﬂows in a conductor and can
be transferred elsewhere, which is also called true electric charge, and the other is
polarization charge that is locally bound around a nucleus in a dielectric material and
cannot be transferred outside. The densities of these electric charges are denoted by
ρ and ρp, respectively. The electrical distortion that these electric charges cause in
a space is electric ﬁeld. It is represented by a vector E. When electric charge Q is
placed in this space, the following force is exerted on the charge:
F = QE.
(2.1)
This force is called the Coulomb force. When the true electric charge is distributed
with density ρ at position r′ in a region V, the electric ﬁeld at position r that is caused
by the charge is given by

integration is carried out with respect to r′. Equation (2.2) is called Coulomb’s law.
In (2.2) the electric ﬁeld contributed from a point-like charge, ρdV ′, is summed up;

r −r′3 is a vector directed from the electric charge at r′ to the observation
point at r and its magnitude is the inverse of the square of the distance between the
two points. When the electric ﬁeld is integrated on a closed surface S, the following
relationship holds:

S
E · dS = 1
ϵ0

V
ρ(r)dV,
(2.3)
where V is the space surrounded by S and the elementary surface vector dS is directed
outwards. This is called Gauss’ law. While Coulomb’s law describes the local electric
ﬁeld produced by electric charge, Gauss’ law gives the global relationship between
electric ﬁeld and electric charge.
We consider the case where electric charge Q is placed on the origin (r = 0). If
S is a spherical surface of radius r with its center on the origin, the electric ﬁeld E
is parallel to the elementary surface vector dS and its magnitude is a constant value
on the surface on the left side of (2.3). Hence, the left side is given by 4πr2E. Since
the right side is Q/ϵ0, we have
E =
Q
4πϵ0r2 .
(2.4)
This is nothing else than the relationship given by (2.2). That is, Coulomb’s law and
Gauss’ law are relative to each other. The condition of the electric ﬁeld in this case is
shown in Fig. 2.1. The virtual lines in the ﬁgure are called electric ﬁeld lines. These
lines are deﬁned as the lines parallel to the electric ﬁeld and drawn so that the number
in a unit area in the normal plane is just equal to |E|. Thus, Gauss’ law is expressed
by the statement that the total number of electric ﬁeld lines that come out of closed

surface S is equal to the total electric charge inside S divided by ϵ0. Hence, the total
number of electric ﬁeld lines in Fig. 2.1 is Q/ϵ0.
Using Gauss’ mathematical theorem, the left side of (2.3) can be rewritten as

(2.6)
in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), where ix, iy and iz are unit vectors along the x, y
and z axes, respectively. In (2.5) ∇· E is also written as divE, where div is called the
divergence. Since (2.5) holds for an arbitrary region V, the integrands on the both
sides are equal to each other:
∇· E = ρ
ϵ0
.
(2.7)
This is called Gauss’ divergence law. In Cartesian coordinates the left side of (2.7)
is
∇· E = ∂Ex
∂x + ∂Ey
∂y + ∂Ez
∂z .
(2.8)
Equation (2.7) shows that electric charge causes a divergence of the electric ﬁeld.
In the case of the point charge shown in Fig. 2.1, for example, the electric ﬁeld
emerges from the origin at which the point charge is located and expands radially.
This condition is similar to the light emitted from the point source. An electric ﬁeld
line does not emerge from or terminate at a point where there is no electric charge
(ρ = 0). That is, there is no divergence (∇· E = 0).
Here we show an example. Suppose that electric charge is uniformly distributed
with density ρ0 inside a wide slab of thickness 2a parallel to the y-z plane (see
Fig. 2.2a). The electric ﬁeld is now calculated using Gauss’ law (2.3). In this case
the calculation using Coulomb’s law is not easy. We assume a closed parallelepiped
S, one plane of which stays on the central plane, x = 0, as shown in Fig. 2.2b.
Then, the electric ﬁeld must be zero on this plane from symmetry with respect to the
x-axis. That is, the same result must be obtained when the right and left sides are
reversed. It can be concluded that the electric ﬁeld has only the x component (Ex)
from symmetry with respect to the y- and z-axes. Hence, the electric ﬁeld is parallel
to the surface on the four surfaces parallel to the x-axis, and the surface integral of
the electric ﬁeld on these surfaces is zero. The surface integral only has a nonzero
value on the remaining surface. The position and the electric ﬁeld on this surface are
denoted by x and Ex(x), respectively. Then, the right side of (2.3) is AEx(x), where A

b closed parallelepiped S for x > a on which Gauss’ law is applied
is the area of the surface parallel to the y-z plane. Now we estimate the total electric
charge inside S. A simple calculation leads to Axρ0 for 0 ≤x ≤a and Aaρ0 for
x > a. Thus, we have

this result into (2.7) leads to
∇· E = ρ0

−a ≤x ≤a,
= 0;
x < −a, x > a.
(2.10)
This shows that the electric charge is distributed with density ρ0 only inside the slab,
as assumed in the beginning.

This value is determined only by the positions of the two points and is independent

(2.14)
Using the electric potential, the electric ﬁeld is described as
E = −∇φ.
(2.15)
In the above ∇φ is also written as grad φ. The operator grad is called the gradient
and (2.15) is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as
E = −∂φ
∂x ix −∂φ
∂y iy −∂φ
∂z iz.
(2.16)
A virtual surface composed of points with the same electric potential is called an
equipotential surface. The electric ﬁeld lines are normal to the equipotential surface.
The equipotential surfaces for the case of the point charge on the origin (see Fig. 2.1)
are shown in Fig. 2.3. In this case the equipotential surfaces are spherical surfaces
with the centers on the origin.
Using Stokes’ theorem (2.14) is written as

S
(∇× E) · dS = 0,
(2.17)
where S is a plane surrounded by closed loop C. In the above ∇× E is also written
as curl E. The operator ∇× is called the curl. Using Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z),
the integrand in (2.17) is written as

(2.18)
Since (2.17) holds for arbitrary S, we have
∇× E = 0.
(2.19)
This can also be proved mathematically. Using (2.15), the left side of (2.19) leads to
−∇× ∇φ = −curl grad φ.
(2.20)
This is identically equal to 0. Thus, the electric ﬁeld is a ﬁeld without a vortex. The
electric ﬁeld lines are not closed.
The essence of the electrostatic ﬁeld is that it has divergence caused by electric
charge but has no vortex. When polarization charge of density ρp coexists with
electric charge of density ρ, ρ can be replaced by ρ + ρp in the above equations.
2.2
Static Magnetic Phenomena
Here, we treat magnetic phenomena that do not change with time. The sources
that bring about various kinds of magnetic phenomena are electric current caused
by ﬂow of true electric charges and magnetic moment in magnetic materials. In
present electromagnetism, the magnetic moment in magnetic materials is usually
expressed using a virtual magnetizing current. This is because magnetic charges,
which are similar to electric charges, do not exist, and the resultant ﬁeld cannot be
easily described. The densities of the distributed electric current and the magnetizing
current are denoted by i and im, respectively. The strength of the magnetic distortion
of the space that is caused by these currents is called the magnetic ﬁeld and is

represented by the magnetic ﬂux density, B. When a current I is placed in this space,
a force
F′ = I × B
(2.21)
is exerted on a unit length of the current. This force is called the Lorentz force. When
an electric current of density i

(2.22)
This is called the Biot-Savart law. In the above, μ0 is the magnetic permeability
of vacuum given by (1.1), and the volume integral is with respect to r′. When the
magnetic ﬂux density is integrated on a closed line C, the following relationship
holds:

C
B · ds = μ0

S
i · dS.
(2.23)
This is called Ampere’s law. In the above, S is a plane surrounded by C, and the
elementary surface vector dS points along the motion of a screw when a screw driver
is rotated along the direction of the curvilinear integral ds (see Fig. 2.4). This is the
right-hand rule. While the Biot-Savart law describes the local magnetic ﬂux density
produced by an electric current, Ampere’s law gives the global relationship between
magnetic ﬂux density and electric current. This is similar to the relationship between
Coulomb’s law and Gauss’ law.
We consider the case where electric current I ﬂows along the z-axis. Here we
estimate the magnetic ﬂux density at point P separated by distance r from the current.
Ampere’s law is applied on a closed circle of radius r with its center on the z-axis. It
is derived that the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to this circle from (2.22), and its
value is constant on the circle from symmetry. Hence, the left side of (2.23) is given
by 2πrB. The right side is equal to μ0I. Hence, we have

arrangement can be visualized by ﬁne iron particles, etc. The virtual lines in the
ﬁgure are called the magnetic ﬂux lines. These lines are deﬁned as lines parallel to
the magnetic ﬂux density and drawn so that the number in a unit area in the normal
plane is just equal to |B|.

This is called the differential form of Ampere’s law. It shows that the current produces
rotation of the magnetic ﬂux density.
One example is shown here. Suppose that a current ﬂows uniformly along the
y-axis with density i0 inside a wide slab 2a in thickness parallel to the y-z plane
(see Fig. 2.7a). The magnetic ﬂux density can be easily obtained using Ampere’s

Assume a rectangle C with one side on the center, x = 0, on the x-z plane, as shown
in Fig. 2.7a. From symmetry the magnetic ﬂux density has only a z component, and
its value must be 0 at x = 0. The magnetic ﬂux density is integrated along rectangle
C, as shown by the arrows, so as to be consistent with the current ﬂow along the
positive y-axis. Since B is perpendicular to ds on the top and bottom sides of C, the
integral is zero there. The left side of (2.23) is −Bz(x)l, where l is the length of the
side of C along the z-axis. The current penetrating C is lxi0 for 0 ≤x ≤a and lai0
for x > a. From symmetry with respect to x = 0 we have

The magnetic ﬂux density varies only along the x-axis (∂/∂y = 0 and ∂/∂z = 0),
and the left side of (2.30) has only the y component, −∂Bz/∂x. Thus, we have
iy = i0;
−a ≤x ≤a,
= 0;
x < −a, x > a.
(2.32)
This shows that the current ﬂows uniformly in the slab as assumed in the beginning.
Because the magnetic ﬂux lines are closed, as shown in Fig. 2.6, the following
relationship holds for an arbitrary closed surface S:

2.2 Static Magnetic Phenomena

and magnetic ﬂux line

S
B · dS = 0.
(2.33)
Hence, the magnetic ﬂux lines are closed within S, or if the ﬂux line comes into S, it
surely goes out of S, as illustrated in Fig. 2.8. If the left side is rewritten using Gauss’
theorem, it leads to

V
∇· BdV = 0,
(2.34)
where V is the interior of S. Since this holds for arbitrary V, we have
∇· B = 0.
(2.35)
This shows that the magnetic ﬂux density has no divergence.
Here, we treat the potential that produces the magnetic ﬂux density. In this case
we do not have a procedure to derive the potential from the magnetic ﬂux density.
The following relationship holds for an arbitrary vector A:
∇· (∇× A) = div(curlA) = 0.
(2.36)
Since the magnetic ﬂux density obeys (2.35), it can be given in the form of
B = ∇× A,
(2.37)
using a vector A. This vector is called the vector potential. When a current of density
i ﬂows in region V, the vector potential is given by
A(r) = μ0

This is similar to the electric potential caused by electric charge in (2.12). A similar
magnetic potential, a kind of scalar potential, is sometimes used, since analysis using

Basic Electromagnetism
the vector potential seems not to be simple. It is not difﬁcult, however, to use the
vector potential. In particular, the vector potential gives a clearer physical concept,
as will be shown later. In addition, since the ﬁeld caused by the magnetic potential is
nothing else than a gradient, the ﬁeld with rotation cannot be given. That is, the use
of the magnetic potential is inconveniently limited only in regions where the current
does not ﬂow, as in vacuum.
The essence of the magnetic ﬂux density is that it is a rotational ﬁeld that is caused
by current but has no divergence. This characteristic is asymmetrical with respect
to the electric ﬁeld that describes the electrostatic phenomena. When a magnetizing
current of density im coexists with current density i, i can be replaced by i + im in
the above equations.
2.3
E-B Analogy
The electric ﬁeld E is a general ﬁeld produced by the electric charge and polarization
charge, and the magnetic ﬂux density B is a general magnetic ﬁeld produced by the
current and the magnetic moment. These ﬁelds exert the Lorentz force
F = q(E + v × B)
(2.39)
on a particle with electric charge q and velocity v. This phenomenon provides a
single connection between electromagnetism and dynamics. The ﬁrst term is the
Coulomb force and the second term is the Lorentz force in the narrow sense. In
electromagnetism, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬂux density B are treated as
important independent variables, and such a form is called the E-B analogy.
In the framework of the present electromagnetism, electric substances are roughly
classiﬁed into conductors and dielectric materials (insulators). Electric charges (elec-
trons) can move freely inside a conductor and keep the interior electric ﬁeld zero
regardless of any condition on the outside. On the other hand, electrons cannot move
freely due to bonding by nuclei in a dielectric material. Thus, electrons are slightly
displaced when an electric ﬁeld is applied from the outside, resulting in a partial
shielding with a reduced interior electric ﬁeld. This phenomenon is called electric
polarization. In this condition, the electrical neutrality condition is broken, and part
of the electric charge appears on the surface of the material. This electric charge is
called the polarization charge. The polarization charge cannot be transferred outside.
The polarization charge produces the electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld produced in the
dielectric material is also called the electric polarization and is represented by P.
This is associated with the polarization charge as
∇· P = −ρp,
(2.40)
where ρp is the polarization charge density. It should be noted that the sign is different
from (2.7) for the relationship between the electric ﬁeld and the electric charge

2.3 E-B Analogy
23
density. This is because the polarization charge always shields in such a way as to
weaken the internal electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld that is produced by the true electric
charge is called the electric ﬂux density and represented by D. The relationship
between D and E is given by
E = 1
ϵ0
(D −P).
(2.41)
Since P is proportional to E in most cases, there is a proportional relationship between
E and D, which is expressed as
D = ϵE,
(2.42)
where ϵ is the dielectric constant.
Only magnetic materials are treated as substances that show magnetic behavior
in the usual electromagnetism. Conductors are non-magnetic materials and are basi-
cally the same as vacuum in terms of their magnetic behavior. The sources of the
magnetism are current and magnetic moment as mentioned above. The magnetic ﬁeld
produced by the magnetic moment in magnetic material is called the magnetization
and is represented by M. In classic electromagnetism the magnetization is formally
described using the virtual magnetizing current, which can be treated in a similar
way to the current. The relationship to the magnetizing current density im is given
by
∇× M = im.
(2.43)
The magnetic ﬁeld produced only by the current is called the magnetic ﬁeld and is
represented by H. Its relationship to the magnetic ﬂux density B is
B = μ0(H + M).
(2.44)
Since M is proportional to B in most cases, there is a proportional relationship
between B and H, which is expressed as
H = 1
μB,
(2.45)
where μ is the magnetic permeability. The fact that the magnetizing current does
not shield most magnetic materials is a characteristic difference from the electrical
phenomena. Hence, the sign is different between (2.40) and (2.43).
As discussed above, there is a difference between electricity and magnetism with
respect to the component materials. That is, while conductors with electric charge and
dielectric materials with polarization charge are treated in electricity, only magnetic
materials with magnetizing current are treated in magnetism. It is proposed here to

24

Basic Electromagnetism
introduce superconductors, in which current causes magnetic behavior, as one of
magnetic substances in such a way as to make electricity and magnetism more equal
to each other, which will contribute to advancing the E-B analogy.
2.4
Electromagnetic Phenomena Varying with Time
When electromagnetic ﬁelds vary with time, the equations described in Sects. 2.1
and 2.2 do not hold. One of them is the electromagnetic induction. Faraday’s law
describes how the electromotive force is induced by variation in the magnetic ﬂux
with time. That is, if the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates a closed circuit C is denoted
by 	, the electromotive force is given by
Vem = −d	
dt ,
(2.46)
where the directions of the magnetic ﬂux and electromotive force obey the right-hand
rule. The left side of (2.46) is given by the curvilinear integral of the induced electric
ﬁeld. Hence, we have

C
E · ds = −d
dt

S
B · dS.
(2.47)
Using Stokes’ theorem, the left side of this equation is rewritten as the left side of
(2.17). Since the plane S does not change with time, the order of the time derivative
and surface integral can be changed:

S
(∇× E) · dS = −

S
∂B
∂t · dS.
(2.48)
Since this holds for arbitrary S, we have
∇× E = −∂B
∂t .
(2.49)
This is the differential form of Faraday’s law. When there is no variation with time,
this equation leads to (2.19), which describes the electrostatic ﬁeld. Hence (2.49)
holds generally, including the electrostatic ﬁeld.
Assume that plane S moves with velocity V in a space with uniform magnetic ﬂux
density B. We calculate the magnetic ﬂux 	 that enters S during a short period t.
Since the magnetic ﬂux that enters through a small segment ds, which is the magnetic
ﬂux in the hatched region shown in Fig. 2.9, is (Vt × ds) · B = (B × V) · dst,
	 is obtained as

(2.50)
This gives 	/t. In the limit t →0, this leads to the derivative with time, d	/dt.
Since the electromotive force is given by the left side of (2.47), we have

C
E · ds = −

C
(B × V) · ds.
(2.51)
Thus, we can assume
E = V × B.
(2.52)
Although there is arbitrariness by an mount of a gradient of a scalar function f
between both sides in (2.52), it is empirically known that this term is zero. Thus
(2.52) holds generally.
One more equation that needs to be corrected is Ampere’s law of (2.30), which
does not satisfy the continuity equation of current. The left side of this equation is
given by μ0∇×H. The displacement current, ∂D/∂t, is added on the right side after
the correction:
∇× H = i + ∂D
∂t .
(2.53)
This is the generalized differential form of Ampere’s law. This satisﬁes the continuity
equation of current.
The electromagnetic energy density in conditions varying with time is given by
u = ϵ
2E2 + 1
2μB2 +

i · Edt,
(2.54)
where the ﬁrst and second terms are the electric and magnetic energy densities, and
the third term is the kinetic energy given to a moving electric charge. In fact, if the
current density is expressed as a movement of the charge particles of the electric

Basic Electromagnetism
charge q, density n, and velocity v, the current density is given by i = nqv. Hence,
using the Coulomb force F = qE, the term i · E in the third term is rewritten as
i · E = n F · v.
(2.55)
Thus, the third term of (2.54) is the work done by the Coulomb force. The variation
in the electromagnetic energy in space V with time is given by
∂U
∂t = ∂

(2.56)
Using (2.42) and (2.53), the sum of the ﬁrst and third terms in (2.56) leads to
ϵE · ∂E
∂t + i · E = E ·
∂D
∂t + i


(2.57)
Using (2.45) and (2.49), the second term becomes
B
μ · ∂B
∂t = −H · (∇× E).
(2.58)
Thus, the right side of (2.56) is rewritten as

V
[E · (∇× H) −H · (∇× E)]dV = −

V
∇· (E × H)dV.
(2.59)
Here, Poynting’s vector is deﬁned as

Then, using Gauss’ theorem (2.56) becomes

(2.61)
where V is the surface of region S. This equation describes the ﬂow of energy: the

through the surface.

Maxwell’s Equations and Breaking of Symmetry
Maxwell’s equations that describe electromagnetic phenomena are:

∂t ,
(2.62)
∇× H = i + ∂D
∂t,
(2.63)
∇· D = ρ,
(2.64)
∇· B = 0.
(2.65)
These are solved with the material relationships:
D = ϵE,
(2.66)
B = μH,
(2.67)
i = σcE.
(2.68)
In the above, σc is the electric conductivity and (2.68) is the empirical Ohm’s law.
Comparing(2.62)with(2.63)and(2.64)with(2.65),itisclearthatsymmetrybetween
electric and magnetic phenomena does not exist. What is the reason for the breaking
of symmetry?
If we treat the condition in which there is no electric charge and current (ρ = 0 and
i = 0), however, we ﬁnd that the symmetry appears among them (although note that
the sign factor of the derivative with respect to time is different). This corresponds
to electromagnetic waves. Here we look carefully at how the symmetry breaks by
introducing sources that produce the ﬁelds. Since the electric charge is a scalar, the
distortion of the vector ﬁeld (electric ﬁeld) is nothing else than the divergence. This
means that the effect of the electric charge can appear only in (2.64). On the other
hand, the current is a vector and the distortion of the vector ﬁeld (magnetic ﬂux
density) is nothing else than the rotation. Hence, the effect of the current can appear
only in (2.63). This discussion shows that the breaking of symmetry comes from the
mathematical difference between the source being a scalar or vector. This difference
also causes the different natures of the ﬁelds, as mentioned above.
Coffee break (2)
Does the Lorentz force do mechanical work?
It is stated in textbooks on electromagnetism that the Lorentz force does not do
mechanical work, since it only changes the direction of motion of an electric charge
in a magnetic ﬁeld but does not inﬂuence the kinetic energy. On the other hand,
when a current is applied to a conductor in a magnetic ﬁeld, it can happen that the
conductor is driven by the Lorentz force. In this case the mechanical work is done.
How can we understand this phenomenon?

28

Basic Electromagnetism
Suppose that there is an electron travelling in a conductor. The electron tends to
move in the normal direction to the propagation direction in the conductor due to the
Lorentz force. In practice, however, the electron moves along the conductor. This is
caused by the Coulomb force of cations (and if the Hall effect is appreciable, the
inﬂuence of the distributed Hall electrons is also included). That is, the transverse
movement of the traveling electron is strongly suppressed by the cations. This means
that a reaction, which is also the Coulomb force, is exerted on the cations. Hence, this
reaction pushes the conductor in the direction of the Lorentz force. Thus, a Coulomb
force of the same strength as the Lorentz force is exerted on the conductor. Hence,
the statement that the Lorentz force moves the conductor is not correct.
In fact, the Coulomb force moves the conductor, and it is false to think that the
Lorentz force moves it. The Coulomb force is not responsible for this, however,
but the origin of this movement is electric power source. An electromotive force is
induced when the conductor is forced to move, and the electromotive force works to
stop the motion of the conductor. That is, if the work done by the electromotive force
is realized, it cancels out the mechanical work that causes a loss energy. Nevertheless,
the electric power source supplies additional energy to the circuit to keep the current
constant. This causes the loss energy.
Someone is walking while revolving a ball by pulling a string connected to the
ball. Assume that the ball approaches an object and the object falls down due to
the wind produced by the moving ball and is damaged. The force that destroyed the
object is the wind pressure, but it is not the centripetal force, i.e., the line tension of
the string. The responsibility for the destruction lies with the person who revolved
the ball and added a force to prevent the ball from slowing down by the reaction of
the wind pressure. If he would not have added the force, the speed of the ball might
have been reduced and the object might not have fallen down.
Then, what is the case of the Lorentz force that works on quantized ﬂux lines
when a current is applied to a superconductor in a magnetic ﬁeld? It is assumed that
the superconductor is ﬁxed so as not to move.

Chapter 3
Effects of the Introduction
of Superconductivity
into Electromagnetism
Abstract If the E-B analogy, which is current in the present electromagnetism, is
perfect, it seems to be natural that some magnetic material must exist that keeps the
interior magnetic ﬂux density B zero, corresponding to a conductor that keeps its inte-
rior electric ﬁeld E zero. This is in fact a superconductor, which really exists. Hence,
if someone would have assumed the existence of such a magnetic material based
on this analogy in the 19th century, he would have predicted the superconductor,
since it is possible to show that the electrical resistivity of this material must be zero
by using Maxwell’s theory. The magnetic phenomena exhibited by superconduc-
tors correspond to electric phenomena exhibited by conductors in various aspects,
including this point. In this chapter it is shown that introduction of the magnetic
phenomena of superconductors into electromagnetism is inevitable to make the E-B
analogy more rigorous. Reference [1] covers the topical area in this chapter.
3.1
Electricity in a Conductor and Magnetism
in a Superconductor
The internal electrostatic ﬁeld is kept at zero in a conductor, even in an external
electric ﬁeld:
E = 0.
(3.1)
The internal magnetic ﬂux density is kept at zero in a superconductor, even in an
external magnetic ﬁeld, when the magnetic ﬁeld is not strong:
B = 0.
(3.2)
This property that shows the perfect diamagnetism is called the Meissner-Ochsenfeld
effect. These phenomena are quite analogous and support the present E-Banalogy.
Here, electric phenomena in a conductor and magnetic phenomena in the perfect
diamagnetic state in a superconductor are compared in more detail. Equations (2.7)

and (3.1) lead to
ρ = 0,
(3.3)
which requires that there is no electric charge inside the conductor. Hence, if electric
charge exists in a conductor, it stays only on the surface of the conductor. From (3.1)
the electric potential of a conductor is
φ = const.
(3.4)
That is, conductor has equi-electric potential. When electric charge is distributed
with density σ on the surface of a conductor, the electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of the
surface is perpendicular to the surface and its value is given by
E = σ
ε0
.
(3.5)
On the other hand, (2.30) and (3.2) lead to
i = 0,
(3.6)
which requires that there is no current inside the superconductor. Hence, if current
ﬂows in a superconductor, it ﬂows only on the surface of the superconductor. From
(3.2) the vector potential of superconductor is
A = const.,
(3.7)
except in the case where the superconductor is not simply connected and a magnetic
ﬂux penetrates a space surrounded by the superconductor such as with a solenoid
coil. Thus, superconductor has equi-vector potential in most cases. When current
ﬂows on the surface of the superconductor with surface density τ, the magnetic ﬂux
density in the vicinity of the surface is parallel to the surface and its value is given
by
B = μ0τ.
(3.8)
It will be easily understood from the above example that there is an analogy
between the electric phenomena in a conductor and the magnetic phenomena in
a superconductor. Figure 3.1 shows the electric ﬁeld lines produced by the elec-
tric charge on the surface of a conductor and the magnetic ﬂux lines produced
by the current on the surface of a superconductor. The difference comes from the
different features of the respective ﬁelds, i.e., the electric ﬁeld with divergence and
the magnetic ﬂux density with rotation.

Here we compare the electric phenomenon in a conductor and the magnetic
phenomenon in a superconductor in more detail. We suppose that two wide slab
conductors are parallel to each other, as shown in Fig. 3.2, and apply electric charge
of surface density σ to the left conductor and that of −σ to the right conductor. In
this case the electric charges appear on the surfaces that face each other as in the
case of a capacitor. Under these conditions, the electric ﬁeld inside the conductors
(−b ≤x ≤−a, a ≤x ≤b) is zero. The electric ﬁeld is directed along the x axis,
and its strength is

(3.10)
The electric ﬁeld lines are directed from the left conductor to the right conductor, the
equi-electric potential surfaces are parallel to the conductor surfaces, and the electric
potential of the left conductor is higher than that of the right conductor (see Fig. 3.3).
Here, we assume two parallel superconducting slabs of the same shape and
consider the case in which currents with surface densities τ and −τ are applied
along the y-axis on the left and right slabs, respectively. The currents ﬂow on the
surfaces that face each other in this case also. This current distribution makes the
magnetic ﬂux density zero in the interior of the superconductor, −b ≤x ≤−a and
a ≤x ≤b. The magnetic ﬂux density is directed along the z-axis and is given by
Bz = −μ0τ; −a ≤x ≤a,
= 0;
x < −a, x > a.
(3.11)
Since the current ﬂows only along the y-axis, the vector potential has only the y
component, Ay, as shown by (2.38). From the relationship Bz = ∂Ay/∂x, we have
Ay = μ0τa;
x < −a,
= −μ0τx;
−a ≤x ≤a,
= −μ0τa;
x > a.
(3.12)
The magnetic ﬂux lines are parallel to the superconductor surfaces, and the equi-
vector potential surface is also parallel to the surfaces with a higher potential in
the left superconductor (see Fig. 3.4). It is also possible to show this phenomenon

3.1 Electricity in a Conductor and Magnetism in a Superconductor
33

with the magnetic potential. In this case the magnetic potential takes on a higher
value at the upper position in the space between the two superconducting slabs.
Hence, each superconductor surface is not equipotential. On the other hand, the
magnetic potential is zero in the superconductors and the space outside them. Hence,
the magnetic potential is not continuous on the inner surfaces. This shows that,
although the problem can be solved using the magnetic potential, it does not help in
understanding the magnetic phenomena.
Here, we show another similarity between the electric and magnetic phenomena.
We assume that electric charge of uniform line density λ is put on a line at distance
a from a ﬂat inﬁnite conductor surface. Electric charge appears on the conductor
surface to make the electric ﬁeld zero in the interior of the conductor. It may seem to
be difﬁcult to determine the electric charge distribution, the resultant electric ﬁeld,
and the electric potential. There is a useful method, however, to solve this problem.
This method is called the image method, which utilizes the feature that the conductor
surface is equipotential. Here, we deﬁne the coordinates; the x-y plane (z = 0) is
deﬁned on the conductor surface, and the y-axis is deﬁned at the projection of the
linear charge on the x-y plane (see Fig. 3.5a). It is virtually assumed that there is
no conductor. In this case it is enough to put electric charge of linear density −λ on
the line at z = −a, which is symmetrical to the given linear charge with respect to
the conductor surface, so as to make this surface equipotential (φ = 0), as shown
in Fig. 3.5b. This method of putting electric charge at a symmetric position with
respect to the original conductor surface after virtually removing the conductor is
the image method, and the virtual electric charge is called the image charge. The
electric ﬁeld and electric potential obtained using this method are useful only in the
vacuum region (z > 0). The electric potential outside the conductor produced by the
given and virtual electric charges is

which is equal to the image charge. In the above calculation, the transformation,
x = atanθ, was used. The electric ﬁeld outside the conductor is schematically shown
in Fig. 3.6.
In the above, only the region outside the conductor was treated. The fact that the
inner region of the conductor (z < 0) is equipotential (φ = 0) can be proved as
follows: If there is no electric charge on the conductor surface, the given charge of
linear density λ produces electric potential in the conductor region. From symmetry,
this electric potential is equal to that produced by electric charge of linear density −λ
put on the original position where electric charge λ was put. As a result, the electric
potential inside the conductor is the sum of two electric potentials produced by the
electric charges of λ and −λ placed at the same position. That is, this is the electric
potential when there is no electric charge. Thus, it can be proved that the conductor
is equipotential.
Now we assume that current I is applied to a line at distance a from a ﬂat inﬁ-
nite superconductor surface. Current appears on the superconductor surface, so the
magnetic ﬂux density is zero in the interior of the superconductor. The image method
can also be used to determine the vector potential and magnetic ﬂux density on the
outside of the superconductor. The coordinates are deﬁned similarly. The image
current −I is put at the symmetric position, z = −a. The vector potential outside
the superconductor has only the y compotent, Ay, which is given by
Ay = μ0I
4π logx2 + (z + a)2
x2 + (z −a)2 .
(3.18)
This satisﬁes the requirement, Ay(z = 0) = 0, which proves that the superconductor
is equi-vector potential. The magnetic ﬂux density is then given by

is schematically shown in Fig. 3.7. The difference from the electric ﬁeld in Fig. 3.6
comes from the different nature of the ﬁeld.

In this case, the calculation of the magnetic ﬂux density can also be done with the
magnetic potential instead of the vector potential. It is found from Fig. 3.7 that the
magnetic potential decreases monotonically with motion along the direction of the
magnetic ﬂux density. Since the magnetic ﬂux lines are closed, however, the magnetic
potential does not take the initial value when going back to the initial position. That
is, the magnetic potential is a multi-valued function, the value of which changes by
the same amount when circulating once. On the other hand, the vector potential takes
a constant value on the closed ﬂux lines in Fig. 3.7, and the equi-vector potential
surfaces are of the same form as the equipotential surfaces in Fig. 3.6.
3.2
Prediction of Superconductivity
As is seen in the last section, the electric phenomena in a conductor showing E = 0
and the magnetic phenomena in a superconductor showing B = 0 are analogous to
each other. This is an outstanding analogy in the present E-Banalogy. If this analogy
was believed, someone might have happened to predict the superconductor, a material
showing perfect diamagnetism, even just after the formulation of Maxwell’s theory
in the 19th century. People know now that the resistivity of this material is zero. It
could be easily shown that the resistivity of a material with perfect diamagnetism
must be zero. That is, the prediction of a perfectly diamagnetic material is equivalent
to the prediction of superconductivity.
Here, the proof of the zero-resistivity is treated. It may be supposed that the zero-
resistivity can be easily proved, since the current must continue to ﬂow to shield
the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the outer current, as in the case of Fig. 3.7. We
have to consider the point, however, that such shielding can be accomplished by the
diamagnetism of the material itself, as will be mentioned later. Since this type of
material was not discovered in the 19th century, it was not possible to attribute the
diamagnetic response to the shielding by the current or the intrinsic diamagnetism.
Hence, we have to consider the case in which a current is directly applied to a
diamagnetic material. In this case the current must ﬂow on the surface of the material,
as shown in (3.6). As shown in Fig. 3.8, here, we suppose that rectangle C is located
inside the material in such a way that one side is placed on the surface and parallel to
the current. The current density is integrated on C. The integrated value is not zero
on the side on the surface, while the contribution from other three sides is zero. That
is, we have

C
i · ds ̸= 0.
(3.23)
If Ohm’s law E = ρri holds, (3.23) leads to

(3.24)
This contradicts (2.14), which must be satisﬁed under static conditions. Hence, the
resistivity must be zero to be consistent with (2.14). The material that shows B = 0
under any conditions is nothing else than a superconductor. Thus, the prediction of
a diamagnetic material is equivalent to the prediction of a superconductor.
3.3
Merits of Introducing Superconductivity
Here, the merits of introducing the superconductor into electromagnetism as a
member of the class of magnetic materials are discussed.
(1) Example 1 of progress on the E-Banalogy
One of these merits is an improvement of the analogy between electric phenomena in
electric materials and magnetic phenomena in magnetic materials. The upper panels
in Fig. 3.9 show electric ﬁeld lines when a uniform electric ﬁeld is applied to a
spherical conductor (left) and a dielectric sphere (right), and the lower panels show
magnetic ﬂux lines when a uniform magnetic ﬂux density is applied to a spherical
superconductor (left) and a magnetic sphere (right). It can be seen that the spherical
conductor and the spherical superconductor completely shield the external electric
ﬁeld and the external magnetic ﬂux density with electric charge and current that
appear on the surface, respectively. The electric charge is the source of divergence,

3.3 Merits of Introducing Superconductivity
39
Fig. 3.9 The upper panels show the structure of electric ﬁeld lines around a spherical conductor
(left) and a dielectric sphere (right) in a uniform electric ﬁeld, and the lower panels show the structure
of magnetic ﬂux lines around a spherical superconductor (left) and a magnetic sphere (right) in a
uniform magnetic ﬂux density
and hence, it shields by absorbing electric ﬁeld lines. On the other hand, the current is
a source of rotation, and hence, it shields by pushing magnetic ﬂux lines and keeping
them outside with vortices. Figure 3.9 shows that the density of the electric ﬁeld lines
is at a maximum at both poles, and the electric charge is mostly concentrated there.
On the other hand, the density of the magnetic ﬁeld lines is at a maximum on the
equator, and the current is mostly concentrated there.
It may seem that the analogy is not so strong between the electric ﬁeld lines
around the dielectric sphere and the magnetic ﬂux lines around the magnetic sphere
in Fig. 3.9. If the magnetic ﬁeld lines for H around the magnetic sphere are drawn,
however, those are quite similar to the electric ﬁeld lines (and if the relative dielectric
constant and the relative magnetic permeability are the same, the two kinds of ﬁeld
lines exactly coincide each other). This comes from the fact that the both ﬁelds are
irrotational, i.e., these are ﬁelds with no vorticity (∇× E = ∇× H = 0). If the
electric ﬂux lines are drawn around the dielectric sphere in Fig. 3.9, they are similar
to the magnetic ﬂux lines around the magnetic sphere. The two kinds of ﬂux lines are
continuous on the surfaces. This comes from the fact that both kinds of ﬂux lines are

40
3
Effects of the Introduction of Superconductivity into Electromagnetism
solenoidal, i.e., these are ﬂux lines with no divergence (∇· D = ∇· B = 0). Thus,
although there is no similarity between the most important variables, E and B, in the
E-B analogy, these are quite analogous to the second most important variables, H
and D, respectively. The comparison between the electric and magnetic materials in
Fig. 3.9 makes it clear that only the magnetic material does not shield the external
ﬁeld. In the case of a dielectric material, the polarization charge shields the inside
imperfectly and the inner electric ﬁeld is weaker than the external ﬁeld.
The analogy between the electric and magnetic phenomena shown here may be
more deeply understood with the statement in Sect. 3.1. Although there is a differ-
ence based on the different natures of the ﬁelds, this shows the validity of the E-B
analogy. If the superconductor is removed from the frame shown in Fig. 3.9, it will
be understandable that the analogy becomes extremely weak.
(2) Example 2 of progress on the E-Banalogy
Figure 3.10a shows the electric charge that appears on the surface of a hollow cylin-
drical conductor when a transverse external electric ﬁeld E0 is applied. The electric
charge does not appear on the inner surface and the inner hollow region is completely
shielded. On the other hand, Fig. 3.10b shows the polarization charge that appears
on the surface of a hollow cylinder of a dielectric material when a transverse external
electric ﬁeld is similarly applied. In this case the polarization charge appears also
on the inner surface because of relative displacement of the positive and negative
electric charges. As a result the electric ﬁeld appears in the hollow region.
Here we compare the difference between hollow cylinders of superconducting
and magnetic materials when a longitudinal external magnetic ﬂux density is applied,
which is analogous to the above comparison. When the magnetic ﬂux density B0 is
applied parallel to the superconducting hollow cylinder, the shielding current appears
on the outer surface but not on the inner surface, as shown in Fig. 3.11, and the inner
Fig. 3.10 Electric charge and internal electric ﬁeld when a transverse electric ﬁeld is applied to a
hollow cylinder composed of a a conductor and b a dielectric material

hollow region is completely shielded. On the other hand, the magnetic moment inside
the magnetic material is expressed as an assembly of small magnetizing current loops,
as shown in Fig. 3.12a. Since these currents cancel out between adjacent loops, the
magnetizing current remains also on the inner surface (see Fig. 3.10b). Thus, the
magnetic ﬂux density appears in the hollow region without being shielded.
The above comparisons clearly show the analogy between the electric and
magnetic phenomena. That is, the difference between the electric charge and the
polarization charge is analogous to that between the current and the magnetizing
current. Hence, it can be said that the introduction of a superconductor is effective
to show this example.

line ﬁlled with different magnetic materials
(3) Example 3 of progress on the E-Banalogy
There is also another merit to the introduction of superconductivity. It is possible
to learn the analogy through exercises on electromagnetism. Figure 3.13a shows a
capacitor in which the space between the two electrodes is ﬁlled with two dielectric
materials with different dielectric constants, ϵ1 and ϵ2, and we must determine the
capacitance. When an electric potential difference V is applied to the capacitor,
the electric charge density is different between the interfaces of the electrode with
each dielectric material. The area of the electrodes and the distance between the
two electrodes are denoted by S and d, respectively. Since the electric ﬁeld in each
dielectric material is E = V/d, the electric charge densities on the interface in each
region are σ1 = ϵ1V/d and σ2 = ϵ2V/d. Hence, the total electric charge is
Q = S
2 (σ1 + σ2) = (ϵ1 + ϵ2)SV
2d
,
(3.25)
and the capacitance, i.e., the electric charge stored by a unit electric potential
difference, is
C = Q
V = (ϵ1 + ϵ2)S
2d
.
(3.26)
It is possible to design an analogous exercise for a superconductor. Figure 3.13b
shows a superconducting power transmission line with two magnetic materials with
different magnetic permeabilities μ1 and μ2. We calculate the self-inductance in a
unit length. It should be noted that the surface current density is different between
the interfaces with each magnetic material, when current I is applied. If the usual

3.3 Merits of Introducing Superconductivity
43
conductor for which Ohm’s law holds is used, such a situation cannot be realized.
The width, length, and thickness of the transmission line are denoted by w, l, and
d, respectively. Since the magnetic ﬂux density B is common to the two magnetic
materials, the surface current densities are τ1 = B/μ1 and τ2 = B/μ2. Hence the
total current is
I = w
2 (τ1 + τ2) = (μ1 + μ2)wB
2μ1μ2
.
(3.27)
Since the magnetic ﬂux is Φ = dlB, the self-inductance, i.e., the magnetic ﬂux stored
by a unit current, is
L = Φ
I =
2μ1μ2dl
(μ1 + μ2)w.
(3.28)
From the viewpoint of impedance, 1/C corresponds to L. Since ϵ corresponds to 1/μ
from (2.2) and (2.22) (note that ϵμ has dimension of (s/m)2), and S and dl are the
areas of the planes normal to E and B, respectively, it can be understood that (3.26)
and (3.28) are analogous to each other. Such effectiveness in education is also one
of the merits of introducing superconductivity.
(4) Derivation of magnetic energy and prediction of the induction law
One of other big merits of introducing superconductivity into electromagnetism is
direct derivation of magnetic energy from mechanical work. The electric energy
can be calculated from the mechanical work needed to carry small electric charges
from inﬁnity until the ﬁnal desired distribution of electric charge is completed. If
we similarly try to derive the magnetic energy, however, the attractive force works
between currents, and the mechanical work to carry a current is negative. This is
attributed to the electromotive induction. For this reason, it is common that students
learn the magnetic energy, which is derived through equivalent electric energy, after
learning about electromotive induction. That is, learning about dynamic phenomena
is required to learn about the static magnetic phenomena.
On the other hand, it is possible to directly derive the magnetic energy from the
mechanical work done by the Lorentz force in a circuit composed of superconductors.
Suppose that there is a closed circuit made of superconducting slabs, as shown in
Fig. 3.14. The superconducting circuit is composed of a ﬁxed superconducting slab
with three sides and a movable superconducting slab with superconducting contact
between them. For simplicity, b is assumed to be much larger than a. It is assumed
that the magnetic ﬂux  is stored in the space surrounded by the circuit. This situation
can be achieved by the following procedure: external magnetic ﬁeld is ﬁrst applied
to the superconducting circuit at a temperature higher than the critical temperature,
and then the temperature is lowered below the critical temperature, which makes
the circuit superconducting. Finally, the external magnetic ﬁeld is removed. This is
called the ﬁeld-cooled process. In this situation, a shielding current is induced in
the circuit. This process is employed to realize a permanent current. The Lorentz

44
3
Effects of the Introduction of Superconductivity into Electromagnetism
Fig. 3.14 Magnetic ﬂux
stored in closed circuit made

force is exerted on the movable superconducting slab that carries the current. Even
if the distance between the slabs changes from a to a + x, the magnetic ﬂux inside
the circuit is preserved. This is because the magnetic ﬂux cannot pass through the
superconducting region to go outside. Hence, the magnetic ﬂux density changes to
B =

(a + x)b
(3.29)
and the density of the current ﬂowing on the inner surface of the superconductors
changes to
τ = B
μ0
=

μ0(a + x)b.
(3.30)
Since the magnetic ﬂux density produced by the ﬁxed superconducting slab is half
of the value given by (3.29), the force exerted on the movable slab is
F = 1
2τBbh =
2h
2μ0(a + x)2b.
(3.31)
Since this circuit is isolated from its surroundings, this force originates from the
variation in the magnetic energy Um of this circuit. From the relationship,
F = −∂Um
∂x ,
(3.32)
the magnetic energy is obtained as
Um =
2h
2μ0(a + x)b =
1
2μ0
B2(a + x)bh.
(3.33)

3.3 Merits of Introducing Superconductivity
45
Since (a + x)bh is the volume of the interior space with constant magnetic ﬂux
density, the magnetic energy density is given by
um =
1
2μ0
B2.
(3.34)
The total current is I = τh, the self-inductance is
L = 
I = μ0(a + x)b
h
.
(3.35)
Using the self-inductance, the magnetic energy is also expressed as
Um = 1
2LI2 = 1
2I = 1
2L2.
(3.36)
The obtained (3.34) is analogous to the facts that the electrostatic energy density
of the space with electric ﬁeld E is given by
ue = 1
2ϵ0E2,
(3.37)
and (3.36) corresponds also to the electrostatic energy of a capacitor with capacitance
C when electric charge of ±Q is given under electric potential difference V:
Ue = 1
2C Q2 = 1
2VQ = 1
2CV 2.
(3.38)
As shown in above, isolated current systems are realized for superconducting
electric circuits. In addition, magnetic ﬂux cannot penetrate a superconductor, and
hence, the magnetic ﬂux inside the circuit is preserved. As a result, the electromotive
force does not appear. This is the reason why the magnetic energy can be directly
derived from the magnetic force.
For the usual electric circuits, the magnetic energy cannot be derived from the
magnetic force because of the electromagnetic induction. Hence, it is even possible
to derive the electromagnetic induction law from the difference between a supercon-
ducting circuit and a non-superconducting circuit. Here we suppose that current I1
ﬂows in a straight line and current I2 ﬂows along a rectangular circuit with two sides
parallel to the straight line, as shown in Fig. 3.15. These are placed on a common
plane. The force on the rectangular circuit is calculated as
F = −μ0I1I2
2πx b +
μ0I1I2
2π(x + a)b = −μ0abI1I2
2πx(x + a).
(3.39)
The force is negative, indicating an attractive force. Here the magnetic energy of this
system is calculated. The self-inductance of the straight line, that of the rectangular

circuit, and the mutual inductance between them are denoted by L1, L2 and M ,
respectively. Then, the magnetic energy of the system is given by
Um = 1
2L1I1
2 + 1
2L2I2
2 + MI1I2.
(3.40)
Since the ﬁrst and second terms are independent of the distance between the two
circuits, these can be disregarded. Only the third term depends on the distance x
between them. Since the magnetic ﬂux produced by current I1 that penetrates the
rectangular circuit is
 = MI1 = μ0I1b
2π
 x+a
x
dr
r = μ0I1b
2π logx + a
x
,
(3.41)
the associated energy is
Um = μ0bI1I2
2π
logx + a
x
.
(3.42)
Thus, the magnetic force seems to be
F = −∂Um
∂x
=
μ0abI1I2
2πx(x + a).
(3.43)
This disagrees with the force in (3.39) and means that the above procedure to calculate
the magnetic force from the magnetic energy is problematic. The result of (3.43)
indicates that the magnetic energy decreases by −Fx during the displacement
of the rectangular circuit from x to x + x. The total magnetic energy, however,
must additionally increase by Um = 2Fx to reach the correct result. From the
reciprocity theorem, half of this energy increase is the increase in the magnetic
energy of the rectangular circuit itself, which is expected to be caused by the induced
electromotive force V in the circuit. If the circuit is displaced by x within time
t, the work done by the induced electromotive force is VI2t. This work can be
rewritten as −I2 in terms of the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates the circuit,

(3.44)
Taking the limit of small t, we have
V = −Φ
t →−dΦ
dt .
(3.45)
Thus, the principle of induced electromotive force can be derived.
(5) Electric polarization and magnetic polarization
One of the effects of the introduction of superconductivity is pointing out a problem
for education in electromagnetism. This is associated with the magnetic moment.
When closed current I ﬂows as shown in Fig. 3.16, the magnetic moment is given by
m = IS,
(3.46)
where S is the area of the current loop. The closed current is equivalent to a virtual
magnetic dipole and corresponds to an electric dipole in the electric phenomena.
The magnetic moment in a unit volume is called the magnetization, which is used
for superconductors and magnetic materials. In electromagnetism, however, the
magnetization is deﬁned by (2.44):
M = B
μ0
−H,
(3.47)
which describes the local relationship. This is not problematic for magnetic materials.
On the other hand, the relationship,
B = μ0H,
(3.48)
holds for the usual superconductors. Hence, if we use (3.47), M = 0 is the result,
and superconductors are classiﬁed as non-magnetic materials but not as diamagnetic

48
3
Effects of the Introduction of Superconductivity into Electromagnetism
materials. This is caused by the fact that the magnetic moment is not produced by M
but by H. The magnetization of a superconductor is given by
M = ⟨B⟩
μ0
−H0,
(3.49)
when there is no inﬂuence of demagnetization caused by the shape, where ⟨B⟩is
the mean value of the magnetic ﬂux density inside the superconductor and H0 is the
external magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetization deﬁned by (3.49) is not a local quantity,
as deﬁned in (3.47), but is a macroscopic quantity for each superconductor. This is
also different from the mean value of (3.47). This description for the superconductor
is attributed to the treatment by thermodynamics for long period, beginning after the
discovery of superconductivity, in which the inner magnetic ﬂux density ⟨B⟩was
discussed as an internal variable against the external variable H0. This also means
that the superconductor has not been treated in electromagnetism.
The analogous comparison in the electric phenomena is electrostatic shielding
in a conductor and electric polarization in a dielectric material. These are similar
shielding phenomena, although the shielding is imperfect in the dielectric material,
while the shielding is perfect in the conductor. Both of these shielding phenomena
are explained as due to relative movement of positive and negative electric charges
under the applied electric ﬁeld, although these phenomena have not been compared.
The terms are also different, i.e., electrostatic shielding and electric polarization. For
this reason, there was no confusion as in the magnetic phenomena. If we discuss
these phenomena as in the magnetization, however, we have P = 0 in a conductor,
assuming the relationship of D = ϵ0E. On the other hand, it is true that the electric
dipole moment in the conductor is not zero under the condition of electrostatic
shielding. Thus, a similar contradiction appears in electric phenomena.
When we look back at the magnetization, it makes a difference whether the source
of the magnetic moment is a real current that produces H or a virtual magnetization
current that produces M. In addition, the magnetization in a superconductor and that
in a magnetic material are also different from the viewpoint of shielding. Neverthe-
less, the same term is used for these phenomena. For this reason, some scientists have
believed that the magnetization in a superconductor can be described either by H or
by M. From the consideration of a hollow superconductor, as in Fig. 3.11, however,
it is clear which is correct.
As shown above, the scientiﬁc description of magnetization is not complete.
The introduction of superconductivity has clariﬁed this lack of completeness. The
complete description cannot be implemented by the author alone, since the agree-
ment of society is required. Here, the author wishes to propose the following: Since
the term “magnetization” has been used for magnetic materials for long time, this
term may continue to be used for these materials. Then, we need to use another term
for superconductors. The ﬁrst proposal is to use “magnetic moment density”, which
follows from the original deﬁnition of magnetization, i.e., the magnetic moment in a
unit volume. In addition, from the basic viewpoint of the E-B analogy, it is desirable

3.3 Merits of Introducing Superconductivity
49
Fig. 3.17 Long
superconducting hollow
cylinder with tilted slit
to deﬁne a new term for the electric polarization in a conductor, which is analogous
to the electric polarization in a dielectric material. The second proposal is to use
“electric dipole moment density” for this term.
We have shown that the introduction of superconductivity into electromagnetism
brings about a deep correspondence between electric and magnetic phenomena in
the present E-B analogy, which will be effective for education. In other words, if
superconductivity is not introduced, the E-B analogy seems to be quite insufﬁcient.
Coffee break (3)
Penetration of magnetic ﬂux into a superconducting hollow cylinder with a tilted
slit
Magnetic ﬂux cannot penetrate a superconductor. Suppose that a magnetic ﬁeld is
applied to a superconducting hollow cylinder with a tilted slot, as shown in Fig. 3.17.
Does the magnetic ﬂux, which is not parallel to the slit, penetrate into the interior of
the hollow superconductor?
If the magnetic ﬂux tends to penetrate straight into the interior, it may cross
the superconductor. This suggests that the magnetic ﬂux cannot penetrate the
superconductor. Is this true?
Remember here that a superposition holds for the magnetic ﬂux density. When
the magnetic ﬁeld is applied, a shielding current ﬂows on the superconductor surface
to stop the magnetic ﬂux penetration, as shown in Fig. 3.18b. This current is realized
by the sum of the shielding current on the inner and outer surfaces of a virtual hollow
superconductor with no slit, as shown in Fig. 3.18b, and the current ﬂowing in the
opposite direction only in the region of the slit, as shown in Fig. 3.18c. The external
magnetic ﬁeld and the current in Fig. 3.18b shields the virtual hollow superconductor
completely but produces a magnetic ﬁeld of the same strength as the external ﬁeld in
the interior. In the region of the slit, these currents do not produce the magnetic ﬁeld,
but the current in Fig. 3.18c produces the magnetic ﬁeld. The resultant magnetic ﬂux

ductor with no slit, and c current in the opposite direction in the slit region. The current in a is

is tilted to ﬁt the slit. This means that the magnetic ﬂux is tilted when it penetrates
into the interior.

Abstract In this chapter fundamental properties such as quantization of magnetic
ﬂux, the normal core in the central region in each packet of quantized magnetic ﬂux,
and the induced electric ﬁeld under the motion of quantized magnetic ﬂux driven
by the Lorentz force are described by using the Ginzburg–Landau theory. These are
important for understanding the electromagnetic characteristics of superconductors
that will be introduced in Chap. 5. Reference [1] covers a wide area of the material
in this chapter.
4.1
Type II Superconductor
Superconductors used as materials for magnets are type II superconductors. Magnetic
properties of type I and type II superconductors are compared in Fig. 4.1. A type
I superconductor shows perfect diamagnetism until the external magnetic ﬁeld H0
reaches a certain value, Hc, as shown in Fig. 4.1a, and the magnetization (magnetic
moment density) deﬁned by (3.49) is
M = −H0.
(4.1)
This state is called the Meissner state. At a higher ﬁeld the superconductor changes
to the normal state and the magnetization is M = 0. The magnetic ﬁeld Hc at which
the transition takes place is called the critical ﬁeld. On the other hand, a type II
superconductor shows the Meissner state until the external magnetic ﬁeld reaches
Hc1 and changes to a partially diamagnetic state with penetration of the magnetic ﬂux
above this ﬁeld. This state is called the mixed state. When the external ﬁeld exceeds
Hc2, the superconductor goes into the normal state, and M = 0. These characteristic
ﬁelds, Hc1 and Hc2, are called the lower and upper critical ﬁelds, respectively. The
magnetic ﬂux in the superconductor is quantized as shown in Fig. 4.2 in the mixed
state. The quantized packet of magnetic ﬂux is called the magnetic ﬂux line. When
the magnetization is expresses as a property of the equivalent type I superconductor
with the same area, as shown in Fig. 4.1b, Hc is called the thermodynamic critical
ﬁeld. The phase diagrams on the temperature vs magnetic ﬁeld plane for type I and
type II superconductors are shown in Fig. 4.3a, b, respectively.

The magnitude of Hc is roughly proportional to the critical temperature Tc for all
superconductors, and hence, it does not change very widely. On the other hand, Hc2
of a type II superconductor can take on a large value. In particular, Hc2 of practical
superconductors is very large, and this is an advantageous property for applications.

Ginzburg-Landau theory. The main points are introduced here. In the beginning,
the density of superconducting electrons is deﬁned and assumed to be given by ||2,
where  is a complex quantity called the order parameter. Since the free energy in the
superconductor depends on the density of superconducting electrons, the free energy
is assumed to be given by a function of a power series of ||2. The momentum is
given by a spatial variation of  in a similar manner to the wave function in quantum
mechanics, and the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the momentum.
With this energy and the magnetic energy, the Helmholtz free energy density is given
by

which is called the Ginzburg-Landau free energy density, where α and β are param-
eters, A is the vector potential, m∗and −2e are the mass and electric charge of a
superconducting electron, respectively, and ℏis Planck’s constant, hP, divided by
2π. Fn(0) is the free energy density in the normal state in zero ﬁeld (B = 0) and the

fourth and ﬁfth terms are the magnetic and kinetic energies, respectively. The order
parameter, , and the vector potential, A, are determined in such conditions that the
energy density is minimized with respect to these quantities. These conditions are
respectively given by

where i is the superconducting current density (see Appendix A.1). These equations
are called the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations.
(2) Transition at T = Tc
Here, we treat the transition at T = Tc in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld. We can
assume that A = 0. Spatial variation in  can be disregarded, and (4.2) leads to
Fs(0) = Fn(0) + α||2 + 1
2β||4.
(4.5)
When this is minimized with respect to , the condition ∂Fs/∂||2 = 0 leads to
||2 = −α
β ≡|∞|2,
(4.6)
where ∞is the equilibrium value of . The parameter α should depend on the
temperature as
α ∝Tc −T,
(4.7)
and the condition ∂2Fs(0)/∂

||22 = β > 0 should be satisﬁed, so that the super-
conducting state is stable at temperatures below Tc. The free energy density in this
case is:
Fs(0) = Fn(0) −α2
2β ,
(4.8)
which indicates that the free energy is lower in the superconducting state. At temper-
atures above Tc, the state of (4.6) can no longer be realized, but the normal state of
 = 0 with a lower energy is the result. Thus, the transition to the normal state at
T = Tc is explained, as shown in Fig. 4.4.

superconducting electron
density in the equilibrium
state. It changes from the
value given by (4.6) to the
value |∞|2 = 0 in the
normal state at T = Tc
(3) Transition in magnetic ﬁeld
Here, we discuss the transition in magnetic ﬁeld. It is necessary to treat the Gibbs
free energy density for this purpose. The magnetic ﬂux density in the superconductor
in the external magnetic ﬁeld H0 is denoted by B. Using the Helmholtz free energy
density, the Gibbs free energy density is given by
(4.9)
In the superconducting state the magnetic ﬂux density is zero (B = 0) and the ﬁrst
term is given by (4.8). Thus, we have
(4.10)
In the normal state, substitution of ||2 = 0 and B = μ0H0 leads to
(4.11)
Since
are equal to each other at the transition ﬁeld H0 = Hc, we have
α2
β = μ0Hc
2.
(4.12)
From (4.10)—(4.12) the Gibbs free energy density is given by
(4.13)
Equation (4.13) explains that the superconducting and normal states are derived at
H0 < Hc and H0 > Hc, respectively. In particular (4.14) leads to
(4.14)

4.2 Ginzburg–Landau Theory
57
The maximum difference in the energy density (1/2)μ0Hc2 is called the condensation
energy density.
(4) Meissner state
Here, the Meissner state is treated. The magnetic ﬁeld penetrates only in the vicinity
of the surface, while the magnetic ﬂux density is zero and the order parameter has
the equilibrium value ∞in most regions of the superconductor. Thus, the spatial
variation in the order parameter can be safely neglected, and (4.4) leads to
i = −4e2
m∗|∞|2A.
(4.15)
The rotation of this equation leads to
∇× ∇× B = −1
λ2 B,
(4.16)
where λ is the penetration depth given by
λ =

m∗
4μ0e2|∞|2
1/2
.
(4.17)
Equation (4.16) is called the London equation. Here, it is shown that this equation
describes the Meissner state. Assume that we apply external magnetic ﬁeld H0 along
the z–axis to a semi-inﬁnite superconductor that occupies x ≥0. The inner magnetic
ﬂux density also has the z–component and depends only on x, the distance from the
surface. Then, we have ∇× B = −(∂Bz/∂x)iy, and (4.16) leads to
∂2Bz
∂x2 = 1
λ2 Bz.
(4.18)
This equation can be easily solved. Under the conditions of Bz(0) = μ0H0 and a
ﬁnite value at x →∞, we have
Bz(x) = μ0H0exp

−x
λ

.
(4.19)
Thus, the magnetic ﬂux penetrates only up to the distance λ from the surface, as
shown in Fig. 4.5. This is the reason why λ is called the penetration depth. Since
λ is usually smaller than 100 nm, the inner magnetic ﬂux can be neglected for a
superconductor of usual size, and hence, the Meissner state can be explained.
(5) Quantization of magnetic ﬂux
It is shown here that the magnetic ﬂux inside the superconductor is quantized. It is
expected that the magnetic ﬂux has a high density at the center and is extended up

58

Fundamental Electromagnetic Properties of Superconductors
Fig. 4.5 The magnetic ﬂux
density in the superconductor
given by (4.19)
to the distance of about λ from the center. Here we assume an isolated ﬂux line and
suppose circle C of a sufﬁciently large radius with the center at the ﬂux line on a plane
perpendicular to the ﬂux line. The order parameter is expressed as  = ||exp(iϕ).
Then, (4.4) is rewritten as
i = −2ℏe
m∗||2∇ϕ −4e2
m∗||2A.
(4.20)
We can safely assume i = 0 on C, because B = 0 there. Since ||2 is not zero on C,
we have
A = −ℏ
2e∇ϕ.
(4.21)
Integrating this on C leads to the magnetic ﬂux surrounded by C:
	 =


∇× A · dS =
	
C
A · ds = −ℏ
2e
	
C
∇ϕ · ds = −ℏ
2e
ϕ,
(4.22)
where S is the region surrounded by C and 
ϕ is the increase in the phase after one
circulation, based on Stokes’ theorem. We should note that the curvilinear integral
of a gradient of a scalar function on a closed loop is usually zero. There are two
exceptions: One of them is the case where space S is not simply connected. That is,
some closed loop cannot shrink to a point inside the space. A superconducting ring
is an example of this case. The other is the case where singular points exist inside
loop C. The present situation belongs to the latter case. The singular point will be
discussed later and we will proceed to discuss the quantization of magnetic ﬂux.
From the requirement that the order parameter is a single-valued function, 
ϕ in
(4.22) must be an integral multiple of 2π. In the present case this value is −2π. That
is,
	 = φ0,
(4.23)

4.2 Ginzburg–Landau Theory
59
where φ0 is the magnetic ﬂux quantum, i.e., the unit of the magnetic ﬂux given by
φ0 = hP
2e = 2.0678 × 10−15 Wb.
(4.24)
When n ﬂux lines exist inside C, the total magnetic ﬂux is nφ0. Thus, it can be shown
that the magnetic ﬂux is quantized inside superconductor.
Here, we investigate the structure of the central area of a quantized magnetic ﬂux
line. Using cylindrical coordinates, the curvilinear integral of ∇ϕ in (4.22) on loop
C is
	
C
∇ϕ · ds =
	
C
∂ϕ
∂θ dθ,
(4.25)
where θ is the azimuthal angle. The solution for ϕ that results in the integral being
equal to −2π is
ϕ = −θ.
(4.26)
Hence, we have
∇ϕ = −1
r iθ,
(4.27)
with iθ denoting the azimuthal unit vector. The magnitude of this quantity diverges
at the center of the quantized magnetic ﬂux (r = 0). Thus, the center is a singular
point. This is the reason why the curvilinear integral of this quantity on a closed loop
is not zero.
Another important feature is derived from this singularity. The ﬁrst term of the
superconducting current density in (4.20) is proportional to ∇ϕ. Therefore, || must
be zero at the center of the ﬂux line, so as to prevent the current density from diverging
to inﬁnity. It is indeed derived from a detailed analysis that || ∝r around the center.
Thus, the central area in each quantized magnetic ﬂux packet is in the normal state.
(6) Coherence length
Thecharacteristiclengthofthespatialvariationinthemagneticﬁeldisthepenetration
depth given by (4.17). Here we discuss the characteristic length of the spatial variation
in the order parameter. For simplicity, we treat the case where magnetic ﬁeld is not
applied. Hence, we can assume A = 0. In addition, we assume that  varies only
along the x-axis. Using the normalized order parameter ψ = /|∞|, (4.3) is written
as
ξ 2 d2ψ
dx2 + ψ −|ψ|2ψ = 0,
(4.28)

60

where ξ is the coherence length given by
ξ =
ℏ
(2m∗|α|)1/2 =
ℏ
2
√
2eμ0Hcλ
.
(4.29)
We can chose a real number for ψ. Since the magnetic ﬁeld is not applied, ψ is close
to 1. Hence, if we put as ψ = 1−f , f is much smaller than 1. Thus, (4.28) is reduced
to
ξ 2 d2f
dx2 −2f = 0.
(4.30)
The solution of this equation is given by
f = f0exp

−
√
2|x|
ξ

.
(4.31)
This shows that ξ is the characteristic length of the spatial variation in the order
parameter.
The spatial variation in the order parameter around the center of a quantized
magnetic ﬂux packet is also given by ξ. The structure of the central region of the
quantized magnetic ﬂux in type II superconductors is shown in Fig. 4.6. The region
of radius ξ around the center of the quantized magnetic ﬂux is called the normal core.
The coherence length in the Ginzburg–Landau theory given by (4.29) increases with
increasing temperature, because |α| varies in proportion to 1−T/Tc. This is different
from the coherence length ξ0 in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, which
Fig. 4.6 Spatial structure of the order parameter and magnetic ﬂux density in the central region of
an isolated quantized magnetic ﬂux packet

4.2 Ginzburg–Landau Theory
61
is independent of the temperature. For clean superconductors, however, ξ and ξ0 are
roughly the same at low temperatures. If the number density of scattering centers
for electrons such as impurities increases, the electron mean free path, l, decreases,
which results in a decrease in the coherence length as (ξ0l)1/2. ξ0 does not change
with l in this case either.
(7) Upper critical ﬁeld and type II superconductor
In the vicinity of the upper critical ﬁeld the distance between ﬂux lines decreases,
and hence, the magnetic ﬂux overlaps, resulting in an almost uniform magnetic ﬂux
density. Hence, we can assume that B ∼= μ0H0 around the transition to the normal
state. The order parameter has a small value and the term proportional to ||4 can be
safely neglected in the free energy density given by (4.2). Rewriting the kinetic energy
density, the Ginzburg–Landau free energy density is expressed as (see Appendix A.2)
⟨Fs(B)⟩= Fn(0) + μ0Hc
2⟨−|ψ|2 + 2ξ 2(∇|ψ|)2⟩+ 1
2μ0H0
2.
(4.32)
Here, ⟨⟩represents a spatial average. The Gibbs free energy density in the
superconducting state is given by
(4.33)
On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy density in the normal state is
(4.34)
Hence, the transition to the normal state occurs at the magnetic ﬁeld at which the
spatial variation in the second term in (4.33) is zero. That is, the upper critical
ﬁeld is the magnetic ﬁeld at which the increase in the kinetic energy consumes the
condensation energy. Abrikosov determined the upper critical ﬁeld as the maximum
value of the magnetic ﬁeld at which (4.3), with neglect of the higher order term of
, has a solution. This theoretical treatment leads to the same result as the above
treatment using the Gibbs free energy density, although the latter process is essential
from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. According to the result Abrikosov obtained,
the upper critical ﬁeld is given by
Hc2 = 4eμ0Hc2λ2
ℏ
.
(4.35)
The ratio of the two characteristic lengths
κ = λ
ξ
(4.36)

62

is called the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. κ is almost independent of temperature.
We have |∞|2 = μ0Hc2/|α| using (4.6) and (4.12). Then, (4.17) is rewritten as
λ = (m∗|α|)1/2/(2eμ0Hc). Eliminating (m∗|α|)1/2 in the expression of ξ in terms of
λ, we have
κ = 2
√
2eμ0Hcλ2
ℏ
.
(4.37)
Then, (4.35) is reduced to
Hc2 =
√
2κHc.
(4.38)
A type II superconductor is a superconductor with Hc2 higher than Hc, i.e., with
κ higher than 1/
√
2. It is required that superconducting current can ﬂow around
the center in a region of about λ from the center so as to keep the structure of
the quantized magnetic ﬂux stable, as shown in Fig. 4.5. That is, superconducting
electrons of sufﬁcient density must exist in this region. This also shows that the
condition that λ is larger than ξ is needed for type II superconductors.
Eliminating (m∗|α|)1/2 in λ by using ξ, (4.35) is written as
Hc2 =
ℏ
2eμ0ξ 2 =
φ0
2πμ0ξ 2 .
(4.39)
This formula is used to estimate the coherence length using the observed upper
critical ﬁeld.
The lower critical ﬁeld of a type II superconductor is also expressed using Hc and
κ as
Hc1 =
Hc
√
2κ
(logκ + 0.081).
(4.40)
4.3
Flux Flow State
In this section the case is treated where the ﬂux lines with density B ﬂow with velocity
v under the Lorentz force. In this situation a macroscopic electric ﬁeld of strength
E = B × v
(4.41)
is induced. This equation is called Josephson’s formula. This can be expected from
(2.52) for the general case. That is, when a substance moves with velocity V in a
space of uniform magnetic ﬂux density, it is equivalent to the situation where ﬂux

lines move with velocity −V in the substance. On substituting V = −v into (2.52),
we have (4.41).
Here we investigate the phenomenon microscopically. The essential point is
roughly explained following the Bardeen-Stephen model [2]. It is assumed that the
spacing between ﬂux lines is sufﬁciently large that overlap of the magnetic ﬂux of
each ﬂux line can be neglected. Thus, we treat an isolated ﬂux line. The local model
is applied that assumes a simpliﬁed structure of the ﬂux line with the core of radius
ξ in the fully normal state. The two dimensional cylindrical coordinates are deﬁned
with the origin on the center of the ﬂux line and the azimuthal angle θ is deﬁned
measured from the x-axis along which the ﬂux line is driven. When a screw is rotated
to increase θ, it points along the direction of the magnetic ﬂux (see Fig. 4.7). From
the equation of motion of a superconducting electron on the outside of the normal
core (r > ξ), the local electric ﬁeld on the electron can be derived as (see Appendix
A.3)
e = φ0v
2πr2 (iθcosθ −irsinθ) + 1
2(B × v),
(4.42)
where iθ and ir are azimuthal and radial unit vectors, respectively. On the other hand,
the local electric ﬁeld inside the normal core (r < ξ) is obtained as
e = φ0v
2πξ 2 iy + 1
2(B × v)
(4.43)
from the condition that the tangential component of the electric ﬁeld should be
continuous on the boundary r = ξ. Here iy is the unit vector along the y-axis. The
spatial average of the electric ﬁeld gives (4.41). Hence, there is no contradiction
with the macroscopic description. Exactly speaking, the ﬁrst term is reduced to 0,
and the sum of the second terms of (4.42) and (4.43) results in (1/2)(B × v). We
used the condition that the area for the average is equal to B/φ0. The condition of

component of the electric
ﬁeld inside and outside the
normal core
the nonuniform component of the electric ﬁeld, which is given by the ﬁrst terms of
(4.42) and (4.43), is shown in Fig. 4.8.
Here we estimate the macroscopic power loss density due to the obtained electric
ﬁeld. The power loss density is averaged over a space sufﬁciently larger than λ or
the ﬂux line spacing and can be regarded as a quantity that varies gradually in space.
Most of the power loss is caused by the intensiﬁed electric ﬁeld inside the normal
core, i.e., the ﬁrst term in (4.43). The power loss in a unit length of ﬂux line is given
by
P′ = πξ 2 e2

(4.44)
where ρn is the normal resistivity. Equation (4.44) gives the power loss under the
macroscopic electric ﬁeld of (4.41). Since the power loss is expressed as
P′ = φ0

(4.45)
in terms of the effective resistivity ρf in the ﬂux ﬂow state, we have

where (4.39) is used. This is called the ﬂux ﬂow resistivity. This relationship shows
that energy dissipation similar to that in the normal state takes place in the normal
cores, which occupy approximately the area fraction (B/μ0Hc2).
Here, we treat the macroscopic current–voltage characteristics in the ﬂux ﬂow
state. The macroscopic current density is denoted by J. The corresponding E-J
characteristics are expressed as
E = ρfJ,
(4.47)
which is similar to Ohm’s law, as shown in Fig. 4.9. The ﬂux lines are driven into
motion when the Lorentz force exceeds the pinning force in practical cases. That is,
the ﬂux ﬂow occurs when a current with a density higher than the critical current
density, Jc, is applied. The E-J characteristics are given by
E = ρf(J −Jc),

as shown by the broken line in Fig. 4.9.

Quantization of magnetic ﬂux
Assume that an isolated ﬂux line exists inside a superconductor. We estimate the
magnetic ﬂux inside the area shown in Fig. 4.10a. The surface integral of the magnetic
ﬂux density is given by the curvilinear integral of the vector potential as shown by
(4.22). In the present case this is written as
	 =

R
A · ds +

L
A · ds,
where R is the half circle and L is the straight line through the center of the ﬂux line.
The radius of the half circle is assumed to be sufﬁciently large and we can consider
that the magnetic ﬂux density and current density are zero on the half circle. Thus,
the ﬁrst term is the curvilinear integral of −(ℏ/2e)∇ϕ. The second term is given by
the sum of the curvilinear integrals of −(ℏ/2e)∇ϕ and −(m∗/4e2||2)i. From the

cylindrical symmetry, i and ds are perpendicular to each other, and the curvilinear
integralofthelatterquantityiszero.Thus,themagneticﬂuxisgivenbythecurvilinear
integral of −(ℏ/2e)∇ϕ on the closed loop. As a consequence, it is concluded that
the total magnetic ﬂux in this area is equal to φ0, because of the requirement of a
single-value function for the order parameter . This conclusion is wrong. What is
the problem?
The wrong result is brought about by neglect of the fact that ∇ϕ is singular at
the center of the quantized magnetic ﬂux on the integral path. Here, we change
slightly the integral path for the second integral to deviate from the singular point,
as illustrated in Fig. 4.10b. Assume a half circle R
′ with sufﬁciently small radius r.
The second curvilinear integral on the new closed loop is the sum of the curvilinear
integral of −(ℏ/2e)∇ϕ and that of −(m∗/4e2||2)i. The former integral is zero since
there is no singular point inside the closed loop. The second integral is zero on the
loop except for the half circle R
′, since i = 0 on the half circle R, and i and ds are
perpendicular to each other on the straight part of the path L′. The remaining integral
on R′ is rewritten as the sum of the integral of (ℏ/2e)∇ϕ and that of A. The latter
integral is equal to the magnetic ﬂux of negative value in the area surrounded by
R
′ and the straight section. This magnetic ﬂux can be neglected by reducing r to an
inﬁnitesimal. From (4.27) the latter integral leads to

Hence, the magnetic ﬂux in the closed loop in Fig. 4.10a is given by 	 = φ0/2. This
agrees with the intuitive answer.

The same result should be obtained, if we choose an integral path so that the
singular point is included inside the closed loop. Derive the correct result in this
case.

Chapter 5
Flux Pinning Phenomena
Abstract The main advantage of superconductors, that these materials can transport
electric current without energy dissipation, is achieved by the mechanism of ﬂux
pinning. Quantized ﬂux lines that contain superconducting structure inside do not
move under interaction with defects in the superconductor, even when the Lorentz
force is present due to the current. As a consequence, no electromotive force appears,
resulting in no energy dissipation. The mechanism of ﬂux pinning is, in principle,
reversible with respect to the motion of ﬂux lines. The observed results are commonly
irreversible, however, as described by the critical state model, which assumes that
there is a balance between the Lorentz force and the irreversible pinning force. In this
Chapter, the summation theory is introduced, which is used to analytically determine
the critical current density, i.e., the maximum non-dissipative current density. The
reason why the resultant electromagnetic phenomena become irreversible is clariﬁed,
eventhoughthefundamental ﬂuxpinningmechanismis reversible. Theirreversibility
in ﬂux pinning phenomena does not originate from the breaking of time reversal
symmetry, but is of another type, such as friction, that is non-dissipative in stationary
condition, although it causes energy dissipation in motion due to the applied force.
5.1
Flux Pinning Mechanism
The resistivity of superconductors takes on a smaller value in the superconducting
state than in the normal state, as shown by (4.46). This property cannot be utilized,
however, since the normal resistivity ρn is very much higher than those of conductive
materials such as copper. The only possibility for application is prevention of the
appearance of induced voltage by stopping the ﬂux motion.
The useful mechanism for this purpose is ﬂux pinning. The superconducting
structure of ﬂux lines, as shown in Fig. 4.5, is associated with this mechanism. The
essential point is that the central region is almost in the normal state ( = 0). Equa-
tion (4.2) shows us that the energy in this region is higher than that in the surrounding
superconducting region. If the normal core of a ﬂux line meets a normal precipitate
in the superconductor, as illustrated in Fig. 5.1a, it is energetically favorable because
of the smaller volume in which the superconductivity is destroyed than when the

Since the change in the energy of this amount occurs during the displacement of the
ﬂux line by 2ξ, as shown by Fig. 5.1, the elementary pinning force, i.e., the maximum
pinning force that this precipitate can exert is estimated as
fp = Up

α-Ti phase contained in the most widely used Nb-Ti alloy superconductor is an
example of normal precipitates working as pinning centers.
Secondly, we will focus on the ﬂux pinning by grain boundaries. These are pinning
centers in Nb3Sn superconductor, which is the second most widely used supercon-
ductor in the world. The effective thickness of grain boundaries is very small in
comparison with normal precipitates. Hence, it may be considered that the elemen-
tary pinning force of a grain boundary is very small due to the very small overlapping
volume. Electron scattering is associated with the ﬂux pinning mechanism in this
case. When electrons are scattered by defects, the electron mean free path is short-
ened, which causes a reduction in the coherence length, as stated in Sect. 4.1f. Hence,
the coherence length, which is the radius of the normal core, becomes shorter when

grain boundary 
Fig. 5.2 Arrangement of the normal core of a ﬂux line around a grain boundary: a overlapping
case and b separated case
the normal core meets a grain boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 5.2a. Since the cross-
sectional area of the normal core with the higher energy decreases, the grain boundary
also works as an attractive pinning center. For the calculation of the elementary
pinning force of a grain boundary, we need certain information, such as the degree of
reduction in the electron mean free path due to scattering and the dependence of the
coherence length on the electron mean free path. Hence, the details are not discussed
here. It is evident, however, that the elementary pinning force of a grain boundary is
weaker than that of a normal precipitate, since only the cross-sectional area changes
slightly during the interaction.
The ﬂux pinning mechanisms involving normal precipitates and grain boundaries
have been treated as examples in above. Since the condensation energy is involved in
both cases, these pinning mechanisms are classiﬁed under the condensation energy
interaction. The critical temperature Tc is different between the superconducting
matrix and normal precipitates in which Tc is zero, and the pinning mechanism caused
by this difference is called the δ Tc interaction. On the other hand, the electron mean
free path l is different between the superconducting matrix and grain boundaries.
The pinning mechanism due to this difference is called the δ l interaction.
In general, the superconducting layer grows in a spiral direction on the substrate
during the process of deposition of high-temperature superconducting ﬁlms. As a
consequence, a screw dislocation is formed at the center of the spiral. Since the
mechanical strain is very high on the center of the screw dislocation, the carrier
density around this region will be appreciably different from the optimal one. It
is speculated that the superconductivity is broken there. Fairly strong ﬂux pinning

by screw dislocations in high-temperature superconductors is also explained by the
condensation energy interaction.
Niobium was introduced into Nb-Ti as a material for pinning centers. Since Nb
itself is a superconductor with almost the same Tc as the superconducting matrix, the
condensation energy is not involved in the pinning mechanism. On the other hand,
the upper critical ﬁeld and hence, the coherence length of Nb is signiﬁcantly different
from those of the matrix. For this reason, the free energy associated with the ﬂux
pinning is the kinetic energy given by the second term in the brackets of (4.32).
The elementary pinning mechanism is explained for various cases above. The
pinning force density observed in practice is given by the sum of individual pinning
forces contained in a macroscopic scale volume. Assume a superconductor that
contains pinning centers with the number density Np and the elementary pinning
force fp. The mathematical problem of estimating the pinning force density Fp as a
function of Np and fp is called the summation problem. Most simply, we can assume
the relationship
Fp = Npfp.
(5.3)
This is called the direct summation. The pinning force density is usually smaller
than this prediction, however, since the inning forces originate from interaction with
pinning potentials. In many cases pinning centers act as attractive potentials. Thus,
the direction of each pinning force depends on the relative position of the ﬂux line
with respect to the interacting pinning center, and hence, some part of the pinning
forces, which are directed randomly, are cancelled, as illustrated in Fig. 5.3, resulting
Fig. 5.3 Randomly distributed pinning centers and ﬂux lines forming a lattice due to magnetic
interaction. Individual pinning forces are directed randomly, depending on the relative position of
each ﬂux line with respect to the interacting pinning center

in a smaller value than that in (5.3). For this reason, it is not easy to estimate the
pinning force density.
Figure 5.4 shows the observed relationship between the elementary pinning force
and the contribution of one pinning center to the pinning force density for Nb at 4.2 K
and at reduced magnetic ﬁeld B/μ0Hc2 = 0.55 [1]. The straight line with a slope of
unity is the direct summation given by (5.3). This result shows that the pinning force
density obeys the relationship called the linear summation:
Fp = ηpNpfp
(5.4)
in the case of strong pinning. Here, ηp is a constant smaller than 1 and is called the
pinning efﬁciency. When the pinning is weak, the pinning force density obeys the
relationship

center to the pinning force density (Fp/Np) for Nb at 4.2 K and at reduced magnetic ﬁeld B/μ0Hc2 =

(5.5)
This is called the statistical summation, since the functional form is the same as the
prediction of the statistical theory.
5.2
Critical State Model
Before going to the summation theory, the critical state model is introduced, which
correctly describes irreversible electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors,
since it is necessary to understand the irreversibility.
It is assumed in the static critical state model that the magnetic ﬂux distribution
is determined by the balance between the Lorentz force and the pinning force [2]:
FL + Fp = 0.
(5.6)
The Lorentz force obeys Fleming’s left-hand rule, as illustrated in Fig. 5.5, and is
given by
FL = J × B.
(5.7)
Hence, the pinning force density is related to the critical current density as
Fp = JcB.
(5.8)
When a transverse magnetic ﬁeld is applied parallel to a superconducting slab, as
shown in Fig. 5.6a, the magnetic ﬂux density has a gradient, and the restoring force
acts to reduce the gradient, as shown in Fig. 5.6b. This is called the magnetic pressure.
When a current is applied to a superconducting slab in a normal magnetic ﬁeld, as
shown in Fig. 5.7a, the magnetic ﬂux lines are curved, as illustrated in Fig. 5.7b, and
the restoring force acts to straighten the ﬂux lines. This is called the line tension. Both

of these forces are the Lorentz force given by (5.7), as will be shown in Sect. 5.7.
This force is a restoring force to reduce strains in the magnetic ﬂux structure caused
by the current. Equation (5.6) means that
Fp = −δFp,
(5.9)
where δ represents a unit vector in the direction of the Lorentz force. That is, the
pinning force is assumed to work in the opposite direction to the Lorentz force. The
electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors will be described using the critical
state model.
(1) Magnetic ﬂux distribution
First, we treat the magnetic ﬂux distribution. Assume that an external magnetic ﬁeld
H0 isappliedtoawidesuperconductingslabofthickness2d(0 ≤x ≤2d)alongthez-
axis. From symmetry, we need only to consider the half region, 0 ≤x ≤d. Magnetic

ﬂux invades the superconductor from both surfaces. The magnetic ﬂux density inside
the superconductor is also the z-component. It can also be assumed that no quantity
varies along the y- or z-axes. Hence, the current density has a y-component only:
J = −1
μ0
· ∂B
∂x iy.
(5.10)
The Lorentz force is of the y-component, and (5.6) is reduced to
B∂B
∂x + δμ0Fp = 0,
(5.11)
where δ is a sign factor and takes the values +1 and −1, when the Lorentz force
is directed along the positive or negative x-axis, respectively. In the present initial
condition, since the ﬂux lines are driven in the positive direction by the Lorentz force,
δ = 1. Here, we assume the simple B-dependence of Fp as
Fp = αpB.
(5.12)
This is called Bean’s model [2]. In this case we have
Jc = αp(const.).
(5.13)
Under the boundary condition B(0) = μ0H0, (5.11) can be solved easily as
B(x) = μ0(H0 −Jcx).
(5.14)
For H0 < Jcd, the magnetic ﬂux does not reach the center of the superconducting
slab, as shown in Fig. 5.8, and (5.14) holds for 0 ≤x ≤H0/Jc. The magnetic ﬂux
density is zero in the region H0/Jc < x ≤d. The penetration of the magnetic ﬂux
induces the current, and its distribution is given by
J = Jc;
0 ≤x ≤H0/Jc,
= 0;
H0/Jc < x ≤d.
(5.15)
This current distribution is shown in the lower panel in Fig. 5.8.
For H0 > Jcd, the magnetic ﬂux penetrates the entire region of the supercon-
ducting slab, and the current with density Jc ﬂows throughout the whole area. The
distributions of the magnetic ﬂux and current in this case are shown in Fig. 5.9.
The external magnetic ﬁeld at which the magnetic ﬂux reaches the center of the
superconductor is given by
H0 = Jcd ≡Hp.
(5.16)

Flux Pinning Phenomena
This is called the penetration ﬁeld. The distributions of the magnetic ﬂux and current
in the region of d < x < 2d are symmetric and antisymmetric to those shown in
above with respect to x = d, respectively.
We assume that the external magnetic ﬁeld is increased to Hm and then, decreased.
The magnetic ﬂux tends to pass out of the superconductor. Hence, in the region near
the surface, δ = −1, and the magnetic ﬂux distribution is given by
B(x) = μ0(H0 + Jcx).
(5.17)
In the inner region, the former magnetic ﬂux distribution remains (see Fig. 5.10):
B(x) = μ0(Hm −Jcx).
(5.18)
The branching point of the two magnetic ﬂux distributions of (5.17) and (5.18) is
x = Hm −H0
2Jc
≡xb.
(5.19)
The direction of the current differs between the two regions separated by this point.
Hence, even when the external magnetic ﬁeld is the same, the inner magnetic
ﬂux distribution is different between the increasing and decreasing magnetic ﬁeld
processes. Thus, the irreversibility in the magnetic behavior can be understood.

(2) Magnetization
Here, we will estimate the magnetization for the processes of increasing and
decreasing magnetic ﬁeld that were treated in the last subsection. Since there is no
effect of demagnetization, the magnetization can be simply calculated using (3.49).
In the initial process (0 ≤H0 ≤Hp), a simple calculation leads to
M = H 2
0
2Jcd −H0 = H 2
0
2Hp
−H0.
(5.20)
For H0 > Hp, we have
M = −1
2Jcd = −1
2Hp.
(5.21)
Equation (5.21) represents the magnetization on the major magnetization curve.
When the external magnetic ﬁeld is decreased from Hm, the situation depends on the
value of Hm. There are three cases; Hm < Hp, Hp < Hm < 2Hp and Hm > 2Hp. We
treat the case of Hm > 2Hp. In the range of Hm > H0 > Hm−2Hp, the magnetization
is given by
M = −

2Hp −Hm + H0
2
4Hp
+ 1
2Hp.
(5.22)
For H0 < Hm −2Hp, the magnetization is on the opposite major magnetization curve
and is given by
M = 1
2Hp.
(5.23)
The calculated results are shown in Fig. 5.11. The minor magnetization reaches
the major curve before H0 is reduced to 0 under the present condition for Hm. For
Hm < 2Hp, the minor magnetization reaches the major curve after H0 is reduced to
0.
The critical current density is often estimated from the magnetization measure-
ment. In the present analysis, the hysteresis width of the major magnetization curve
is calculated as

M = Hp = Jcd
(5.24)
using (5.21) and (5.23) (see Fig. 5.11). Hence, we have
Jc = 
M
d
.
(5.25)

The critical current density is in general a function of the magnetic ﬁeld, and
many models have been proposed for the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the critical
current density. In many cases, except for bulk superconductors, etc., the variation
in the critical current density due to distribution of the magnetic ﬂux density inside
the superconductor can be safely neglected, since the size of the superconductor is
not large. Thus, there is no problem in using (5.25) to estimate the critical current
density from the magnetization hysteresis.
(3) Case of current ﬂow
The critical current density is usually measured under the condition of applying a
transport current to a superconductor in a magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬂux distri-
bution in this condition is treated here. Assume that a DC magnetic ﬁeld H0 along
the z-axis is applied to a superconducting slab of thickness 2d(0 ≤x ≤2d), and
then, a transport current I is applied along the z-axis. In this case the magnetic ﬂux
distribution in not symmetrical with respect to the center of the slab (x = d). So, the
magnetic ﬂux distribution is estimated in the whole region of the superconductor.
First, the magnetic ﬂux distribution is shown in Fig. 5.12a when the DC magnetic
ﬁeld is increased from 0 to H0. After applying the transport current, the boundary
conditions to be satisﬁed are
B(0) = μ0(H0 + HI),
B(2d) = μ0(H0 −HI),
(5.26)
where w is the width of the superconductor along the z-axis and HI is the self ﬁeld
due to the current given by
HI = I
2w.
(5.27)

5.2 Critical State Model
81

The motion of the magnetic ﬂux occurs in the direction of the positive x-axis near the
two surfaces, but the magnetic ﬂux in the middle area does not move. The magnetic
ﬂux distribution is given by (see Fig. 5.12b)
B = μ0(H0 + HI −Jcx);
0 ≤x < xb1,
= μ0[H0 −Jc(2d −x)];
xb1 < x < xb2,
= μ0[H0 −HI + Jc(2d −x)]; xb2 < x ≤2d.
(5.28)
The branching points are
xb1 = d + HI
2Jc
,
xb2 = 2d −HI
2Jc
.
(5.29)
The two branching points grow close during the increase in current and collapse
when the current reaches
I = 2Jcd w = Ic,
(5.30)
and a magnetic distribution with a uniform slope is attained, as shown in Fig. 5.12c.
The current given by (5.30) is the critical current, and the corresponding self-ﬁeld is
HIc = Jcd = Hp.
(5.31)

82

Flux Pinning Phenomena
When the current exceeds the critical current (Ic), the force balance given by (5.6)
no longer holds, and the ﬂux ﬂow state sets in.
(4) Pinning loss energy
Next, we will estimate the loss energy in the superconductor. Sometimes the loss
energy is calculated from the area of the closed magnetization curve in the case of
AC loss energy. This method cannot be used, however, in the case of the loss energy in
a superconducting magnet during the energizing process or that in a superconducting
power transmission line during the process of increasing the current. On the other
hand, the loss energy in any case can be estimated using the critical state model. The
total loss power density is [3]
P = J · E = J · (B × v) = (J × B) · v.
(5.32)
The reason why the loss power can be estimated is guaranteed by the assumption of
irreversibility in the critical state model. The loss power density given by (5.32) can
be regarded as the power generated by the Lorentz force when it drives ﬂux lines
with velocity v. This agrees with a model of dynamics. From (5.6)–(5.9) the pinning
loss power density is given by
Pp = |JcBv|,
(5.33)
where we used the fact that δ and v point in the same direction. Hence, it is necessary
to estimate the velocity v to calculate the loss power. The electromotive induction is
caused by a time variation in the magnetic ﬂux density, and such a variation comes
from the motion of ﬂux lines. Substitution of (4.41) into (2.49) leads to
∇× (B × v) = −∂B
∂t ,
(5.34)
which is called the continuity equation for ﬂux lines [3]. This equation is useful to
determine v.
Here, we treat the AC loss energy density when an AC magnetic ﬁeld of amplitude
Hm is applied parallel to a superconducting slab of thickness 2d(0 ≤x ≤2d).
From symmetry, we have only to treat the half region 0 ≤x ≤d. We needed the
classiﬁcation of the value of Hm for the calculation of the magnetization in (2). The
same thing occurs again. We treat the case of Hm < Hp here.
Since the AC loss energy density is the same between the process of changing the
external magnetic ﬁeld from Hm to −Hm and that from −Hm to Hm, it is enough to
double the loss energy density in the former process. The magnetic ﬂux distribution
when the external magnetic ﬁeld is decreased from H0 = Hm is shown in Fig. 5.13.
The branching point of the magnetic ﬂux distribution is
xb = Hm −H0
2Jc
.
(5.35)

5.2 Critical State Model
83

Here, we estimate the velocity v from (5.34). Since v and B are directed along the x-
and z-axes, respectively, (5.34) is reduced to
∂
∂xBv = −∂B
∂t .
(5.36)
Since magnetic ﬂux lines move in the direction of the negative x-axis from the
branching point x = xb, v is zero at x = xb. The variation with time on the right-hand
side is given by −μ0∂H0/∂t from the magnetic ﬂux distribution given by (5.17).
Hence, we have
Bv(x) = −

(5.37)
Note that Bv(x) is negative, independently of the sign of B. That is, v > 0 in the
region where B < 0 and v < 0 in the region where B > 0. Since the loss occurs in
the region 0 ≤x ≤xb in which magnetic ﬂux lines move, the pinning loss power
density is written as

This result shows that the pinning loss energy in a unit cycle is constant. This is a
characteristic property of hysteresis loss. The same result can be obtained from the
area of a closed magnetization loop.

(5.40)
The obtained AC loss energy density is shown in Fig. 5.14.
(5) Extension to dynamic state
When a current higher than the critical current is applied, the ﬂux ﬂow state described
in Sect. 4.3 sets in. The force balance equation in this case is not given by (5.6) but
by
FL + Fp + Fv = 0,
(5.41)
where Fv is the phenomenological viscous force density. This is called the dynamic
critical state model [3]. The magnitude of the viscous force density is proportional
to the velocity of magnetic ﬂux lines and it is directed opposite to the ﬂux motion.
Hence, the viscous force density is expressed as

AC loss energy density on

where η is the viscous coefﬁcient. When (5.41) is divided by the magnetic ﬂux density
B and v is eliminated using (4.41), we have

(5.43)
This can be rewritten to the E-J characteristics of (4.48). Hence, the viscosity is
related to the ﬂow resistivity as
η = φ0B

.
(5.44)
As discussed above, the critical state model forms the analytic system in which
B and v are used as variables, and the force balance equation and the continuity
equation for ﬂux lines are used for analysis. It is also possible to use the electric
ﬁeld E and Maxwell’s (2.49) instead of v and the continuity equation for ﬂux lines.
The present method using v is beneﬁcial, however, because of the analogy with
mechanical systems.
5.3
Reversible Flux Motion
The critical state model correctly describes irreversible electromagnetic phenomena
in superconductors, as shown in the last section, although the ﬂux pinning phenomena
originate from energetic interaction between ﬂux lines and defects, and such
individual interactions are in principle reversible. In fact, detailed observations
reveal some reversible phenomena. Such reversible phenomena, i.e., electromagnetic
phenomena associated with reversible ﬂux motion, are introduced in this section. This
seems to be contradictory to the principle of the critical state model. The reason why
the irreversibility occurs will be discussed in Sect. 5.4.
When the external magnetic ﬁeld is decreased after increasing to some strength,
the critical state model assumes that the current keeps its critical current density Jc,
but sharply changes its direction across the branching point of the magnetic ﬂux
distribution, as shown in Fig. 5.10. This is a rough approximation. If we look at
the magnetic ﬂux distribution in more detail, however, the distribution is found to
be slightly different from the description by the model. Since magnetic ﬂux lines
elastically repel each other through their magnetic interaction, the magnetic ﬂux
distribution does not change sharply at the branching point but changes gradually
in space. The current also gradually changes its density from Jc to −Jc around the
branching point. The characteristic length of this spatial variation is typically on the
order of 1 μm, and if this length is negligible in comparison with the size of the
superconductor, the macroscopic description by the critical state model is sufﬁcient.

86

Flux Pinning Phenomena
When the size of the superconductor is comparable to or only slightly larger than the
characteristic length, the reversible phenomena become prominent.
Itisassumedthatasuperconductorinthenormalstateiscooleddowninamagnetic
ﬁeld. In this condition, the magnetic ﬂux density in the superconductor is expected
to be constant on a macroscopic scale and is denoted by B. There is no macroscopic
current inside the superconductor. In this case, a group of ﬂux lines, which will move
collectively if necessary, are considered to stay at the bottom of the pinning potential.
It is assumed that these ﬂux lines are displaced by distance u by an increase in the
external magnetic ﬁeld or by an applied current. Then, the force that the ﬂux lines
receive from the pinning potential will be given by
F = −αLu
(5.45)
in a unit volume, where αL is the Labusch parameter that represents the strength of the
ﬂux pinning. The variation in the magnetic ﬂux density caused by the displacement
of ﬂux lines is denoted by b. Integrating the continuity equation for ﬂux lines, (5.34),
with time, we obtain
∇× (B × u) = −b.
(5.46)
For simplicity, we assume that the magnetic ﬁeld is applied along the z-axis and the
displacement is along the x-axis. Then, the spatial variation occurs only along the
x-axis, and (5.46) is reduced to
B∂u
∂x = −b,
(5.47)
where b is the z-component of b. The restoring force, i.e., the Lorentz force, acts to
reduce the strain that appears in the ﬂux line system. This acts along the x-axis as
FL = −(B + b)
μ0
∂
∂x(B + b) ∼= −B

Since this is balanced with the pinning force given by (5.45), we have

(5.50)
Under the boundary condition that b = 0 on the surface x = 0 and the condition that
b is ﬁnite at inﬁnity (x →∞), (5.50) is solved as

(5.52)
This length is the characteristic length of the above-mentioned spatial variation in
the current density from Jc to −Jc. If the pinning strength is increased, i.e., αL is
increased, λ′
0 becomes shorter. The displacement of ﬂux lines u also has a functional
form similar to (5.51).
Just after the change in the external magnetic ﬁeld from the increasing process
to the decreasing one, a similar thing happens. Spatial variation in the magnetic ﬂux
distribution near the surface is expected, as shown in Fig. 5.15. The penetration depth
of the variation in the magnetic ﬂux distribution is not proportional to the variation in
the external magnetic ﬁeld, but is given by λ′
0, so long as the variation in the external
magnetic ﬁeld is small.
When the displacement of ﬂux lines is enhanced, the pinning force density
increases according to (5.45). Some ﬂux lines are depinned from pinning centers,
and new ﬂux lines are captured by pinning centers when the displacement exceeds
some level. Thus, it is expected that the pinning force density is saturated to the bulk
value. This relationship is schematically shown in Fig. 5.16 [5]. The displacement di
at which the pinning force density reaches Fp = JcB at the critical point A is called
the interaction distance and satisﬁes
αLdi = JcB.
(5.53)
The ﬁeld-cooled process is not adopted frequently, but the process of sweeping the
external magnetic ﬁeld is mostly changed from increasing to decreasing or vice
versa in an isothermal condition. When the direction of the displacement of ﬂux
lines changes, the pinning force density also changes. For example, when ﬂux lines

are displaced back from condition P in the critical state in Fig. 5.16, the pinning force
density does not keep the critical value but changes, following the line to condition Q
in the opposite critical state. When the ﬂux lines go back again to P before reaching
Q, the phenomenon is reversible. The loss energy density in the AC condition is equal
to the area of the closed loop in the force density versus displacement characteristic,
similarly to friction. For this reason, the energy is not dissipated in the reversible
case. This means that the energy dissipation occurs when the ﬂux lines are depinned
or when new ﬂux lines are captured by pinning centers.
The relationship in Fig. 5.16 can be checked experimentally using Campbell’s
method [6]. Assume that a small AC magnetic ﬁeld is applied to a superconductor
in a DC magnetic ﬁeld. If we measure the AC magnetic ﬂux penetrating the super-
conductor, the penetration depth of the AC magnetic ﬂux can be estimated. The
relationship between the AC ﬁeld amplitude and the penetration depth of the AC
magnetic ﬂux is shown in Fig. 5.17 [7]. When the AC ﬁeld amplitude becomes
large, the penetration depth increases linearly. This region corresponds to the linear
magnetic ﬂux distribution in Fig. 5.9 and shows that Bean’s model holds. On the
other hand, the penetration depth is almost constant for small AC ﬁeld amplitudes,
as expected from Fig. 5.15. This constant value is λ′
0. The displacement of ﬂux lines

is estimated from the penetrating AC magnetic ﬂux and (5.47), and the pinning force
density is obtained from the slope of the magnetic ﬂux distribution in Fig. 5.17.
The obtained pinning force vs. displacement characteristic obtained in such a way is
shown in Fig. 5.18 [7]. In the ﬁgure, the initial state is the critical state, and hence, the
origin corresponds to point P in Fig. 5.16. Thus, the deviation from the prediction of
the critical state model is correctly described by the reversible motion of ﬂux lines.
As mentioned above, the effect of reversible ﬂux motion is signiﬁcant for small
superconductors with dimensions comparable to or smaller than λ′
0 along the direc-
tion of penetration of ﬂux lines. Assume the case of an applied AC magnetic ﬁeld,
for example. Flux lines penetrate from both sides of the superconductor. From the
symmetry, the ﬂux lines at the center cannot move, and these ﬂux lines stay at the
bottom of the pinning potential. Note that the displacement of ﬂux lines is different
from the distance over which the change in the magnetic ﬂux distribution occurs.
The displacement is usually much smaller than the latter distance. For this reason,
it can happen that the displacement is smaller than the interaction distance, i.e., the
effective size of the pinning potential, even at both surfaces at which the displace-
ment is at its maximum. In this case almost all ﬂux motion is reversible inside the
pinning potential, resulting in a quite small AC loss energy. In Fig. 5.17, λ′
0 is about
20 μm, while di is only about 2 nm.
The AC loss energy density predicted by the critical state model shown in Fig. 5.14
has different dependences on the AC ﬁeld amplitude, based on whether it is higher or
lower than the penetration ﬁeld Hp. That is, the loss energy density is proportional to
H 3
m/Hp for Hm < Hp and approximately proportional to HpHm for Hm > Hp. Since
Hp is proportional to the size of the superconductor, the AC loss energy density is
predicted to change with the size, as shown in Fig. 5.19. The observed loss energy
density in a transverse AC magnetic ﬁeld for a superconducting composite with very
ﬁne ﬁlaments changes with the ﬁlament diameter (df), however, as shown in Fig. 5.20
[8]. This shows that the prediction of the critical state model cannot explain the

of 0.51 μm is much smaller than the theoretical prediction, as shown by the dashed
line for small AC ﬁeld amplitudes. This is caused by the reversible ﬂux motion.

is equal to Hp in the critical state model. When the magnetization curve during the
ﬁeld decreasing process from the upper major curve to the lower one is approximated
by the tangential line at the starting point, the variation in the external magnetic ﬁeld
necessary to reach the lower curve ( ˆHp) is equal to Hp in the critical state model.
This is because the slope of the tangential line is 1. Then, the question is how ˆHp
behaves under the reversible ﬂux motion. The slope is expected to be much smaller
than 1 from the change in the magnetic ﬂux distribution in Fig. 5.15. Under the

diameter decreases. The characteristic ﬁeld ˆHp corresponds to the magnetic ﬁeld
amplitude Hm at which the Hm dependence of the AC loss energy density changes
in Fig. 5.20. Thus, the ﬁlament diameter dependence of the AC loss energy density
can be seen in the behavior of ˆHp in Fig. 5.21. The magnetization curve for Hm in the
intermediate region between Hp and ˆHp is schematically shown in Fig. 5.22. It can
be seen that the magnetization width is very thin in comparison with the prediction
by the critical state mode, which explains the appreciable reduction in the AC loss
energy density. When Hm further decreases, the magnetization at the peak ﬁeld does
not reach the major magnetization curve, resulting in a much smaller AC loss energy
density.
The reversible ﬂux motion surely occurs near the surface, independently of the
size of the superconductor, as shown in Fig. 5.15, when the ﬁeld sweep direction
is changed. Nevertheless, the AC loss energy density in thick superconductors does
not take a small value but obeys (5.39), derived using the critical state model, when
an AC ﬁeld of sufﬁciently small amplitude is applied. This may seem strange. In

reality, the area in which the energy dissipation occurs is fairly extended, as shown
in Fig. 5.15, and this factor approximately cancels the reduction in the loss energy
density. You will ﬁnd much more details in Ref. [10]. The reason why the loss energy
density is kept small in very thin superconductors is that there is no extension of the
energy dissipating area.
5.4
Summation Problem and Irreversibility
In this section the theoretical treatment needed to solve the summation problem
explained in Sect. 5.1 is brieﬂy introduced. Magnetic ﬂux lines form a lattice under
the repulsive magnetic interaction that exists among them, and each ﬂux line interacts
with pinning centers distributed randomly in the superconductor. Because of the
randomness of the distribution of pinning centers, the statistical calculation method
is employed. Namely, an interaction between one pinning center and a ﬂux line near it
is treated representatively, and the pinning force density is estimated from an average
for similar Np interactions in a unit volume. For simplicity, we use a one-dimensional
approximation system along the direction of the Lorentz force. For the representative
interaction, we assume a pinning center with its center at x = 0. The position of the
ﬂux line near the pinning center is denoted by x. The ﬂux line spacing is denoted by
af. Since the area of a unit cell of the triangular ﬂux line lattice is
	√

f , under
the magnetic ﬂux density B, using the ﬂux quantum φ0, we have
af =

.
(5.58)
The pinning force given by the pinning center is periodic with respect to the displace-
ment of ﬂux lines by af. This is because the next ﬂux line interacts with the pinning
center, even if one ﬂux line is depinned. It is assumed that ﬂux lines are driven in
the direction of the positive x-axis. Campbell’s model [5] that assumes a simple
one-dimensional pinning is employed, in which the pinning force is given by (see
Fig. 5.23)

where fp is the elementary pinning force. The force in the direction of the positive
x-axis is deﬁned to be positive. The force balance on observed ﬂux line is given by

(5.60)
where 
 is the virtual position of the ﬂux line if the pinning interaction does not
occur and k′
f is the spring constant for the deformation of the ﬂux line lattice. The
ﬁrst term in (5.60) is the restoring force against the displacement of the ﬂux line by
x −
. This force balance holds under a given global driving force. The sum of the
ﬁrst term over Np pinning centers gives the Lorentz force, and that of the second term
gives the pinning force density.
The summation used here is carried out on all of the individual pinning centers
in the superconductor. This is usually replaced by the statistical average multiplied
by the number density of pinning centers Np. This calculation method is called the
statistical summation. The important point in this theoretical treatment is how to
take into account the randomness of the spatial distribution of pinning centers. If we
assume a perfect ﬂux line lattice, it can be said that the relative position between
each pinning center and its nearest ﬂux line is random. It may be assumed that the
positions of real ﬂux lines can be approximately used instead of the lattice points of
the perfect ﬂux line lattice. Since ﬂux lines are displaced due to the interaction with
their corresponding pinning centers, however, the relative position between pinning
center and ﬂux line is not random, but there is a precise correlation between them.
In the case of attractive pinning centers, for example, the probability of ﬁnding ﬂux
lines around pinning centers is high. Hence, the above-mentioned 
 that represents
the position of the ﬂux line when the pinning effect is virtually switched off is suitable
for the statistical summation.
Here, we calculate the pinning force density. We assume the initial condition
attained by the ﬁeld-cooled process. It can be assumed that the virtual position 
of the representative ﬂux line is within the region −af/2 ≤
 < af/2. When 
 is
given, the position of the ﬂux line x can be determined graphically. When a straight
line with slope k′
f is drawn from position 
, as shown in Fig. 5.24, the dot-dashed
line represents the ﬁrst term in (5.60) with the opposite sign, and the point at which
this line meets the pinning force f (x) gives the solution for x. Note that the solution
is different depending on the value of k′
f relative to 4fp/af.
For k′
f > 4fp/af the position of the ﬂux line in the initial condition is

The above condition is written as fp < fpt. The statistical distribution of x, ρ(x), is
represented in the lower panel of Fig. 5.24. Flux lines are likely to stay around the
center of the pinning center (x = 0), while the statistical distribution ρ(
) for the
lattice point 
 of the perfect ﬂux line is uniform. When ﬂux lines are displaced in the
direction of the positive x-axis, new ﬂux lines come into the treated region from the
left side, and the same number of ﬂux lines go out of the region. As a consequence,
the statistical distribution in Fig. 5.24 is unchanged. The pinning force density is

independently of 
. The statistical distribution in the initial condition is shown in
the middle panel of Fig. 5.25. There are unstable regions where ﬂux lines do not
stay. In the initial state, the distribution is symmetric with respect to x = 0, and the
pinning force density is zero. When the ﬂux lines are displaced in the direction of the
positive x-axis, there is no change in the number of ﬂux lines. The left unstable region
becomes wider, while the right one becomes narrower. The critical state is attained
when the ﬂux front reaches x = af/4. The corresponding distribution is shown in
the lowest ﬁgure in Fig. 5.25. For further displacement, new ﬂux lines come in from
the left side, and the same number of ﬂux lines go out on the right side. Thus, the
distribution is in the steady state. The pinning force density in the critical state is [5]

(5.66)
To obtain a nonzero pinning force density the elementary pinning force fp should be
larger than fpt, which is called the threshold value of elementary pinning force.
The statistical calculation method was employed by Labusch [11] and Camp-
bell [5]. Later, Kramer [1] found, however, that there was a signiﬁcant discrep-
ancy between the results of theoretical calculations and those of experiments on the
threshold value. This raised doubt about the reliability of the statistical calculation
method. As shown in Fig. 5.4, even defects with an elementary pinning force smaller
by a factor of 104 than the threshold value can effectively work as pinning centers.
This result may indicate that there is no threshold value.
The problem with the threshold value will be discussed later, but we will now
discuss the situation in which the ﬂux lines are displaced back in the direction of
the negative x-axis from the condition shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5.25. The
distribution changes through that in the middle panel of Fig. 5.25 to the symmetric
distribution with respect to x = 0 in the lower panel. In the ﬁnal state, the pinning
force density is −Fp. For a further displacement, the critical state is kept. This shows
that the macroscopic irreversibility originates from the biased distribution of ﬂux
lines inside the pinning potential, which is associated with the instability of ﬂux
lines. That is, the unstable region appears on the opposite side to the direction of the
Lorentz force, and the resultant pinning force works opposite to the Lorentz force.
Such an instability is an assumption at this moment, but it will be proved theoretically
in Sect. 5.6. The difference between the general irreversibility and the irreversibility
inherent to the ﬂux pinning will be discussed in Sect. 5.7. Zero pinning force density,
i.e., reversibility, for ﬂux pinning strength below fpt is a consequence of the fact that
the local pinning interaction is reversible. This indicates also that the irreversibility
comes from the above point, which is another mechanism. Thus, both reversibility
and irreversibility are explained by Campbell [5]. Note that the displacement of ﬂux
lines measured by experiments is estimated from that of 
.
5.5
Pinning Loss Energy Density
In this section the pinning loss energy density is treated. All the loss energy is
ohmic and caused by motion of normal electrons in the normal core, as mentioned
in Sect. 4.3. Hence, it has been speculated that the loss energy depends on the ﬂow
resistivity ρf or viscous coefﬁcient η. As shown in (5.39), however, the AC loss
energy density does not depend on ρf. The material parameter that affects the loss
energy is the critical current density Jc or the pinning force density Fp. How can we
understand this result?

98
5
Flux Pinning Phenomena
According to the explanation in Fig. 5.25, the phenomena are reversible when the
ﬂux lines move continuously within the pinning potential. In this situation there is
no energy dissipation. It is suggested, therefore, that the energy is dissipated when
the ﬂux lines move very fast across the unstable region in which those cannot remain
statically. Here, we analyze the unstable ﬂux motion. It is assumed that the elementary
pinning force is larger than the threshold value, so that the pinning is effective. We
have to treat the dynamic force balance instead of the static one given by (5.60). The
equation that describes the ﬂux motion is
η∗v + k′
f(
 −x) + f (x) −η∗dx
dt = 0,
(5.67)
where v is the mean velocity of ﬂux lines and satisﬁes
v = d
dt
(5.68)
and η∗is the effective viscous coefﬁcient for the ﬂux lines in the volume N −1
p
given
by
η∗=
Bη
φ0Np
.
(5.69)
The ﬁrst term in (5.67) is the driving force needed to drive the ﬂux lines in the
representative region with the mean velocity v, and the second term is the restoring
force against the distortion. The sum of these two terms gives the driving force.
The third and fourth terms are the viscous force and the pinning force, respectively.
Campbell’s model is used again for the pinning force.
It is assumed that the ﬂux line initially located at −af/4 in Fig. 5.23 starts to move
to the right side at time t = 0. The virtual position of the ﬂux line 
 is deﬁned as

 = vt + δ,
(5.70)
where δ is an unknown constant. The time at which the ﬂux line reaches af/4 is
denoted by t = t1. Equation (5.67) is easily solved and we have [12]:

(5.78)
The derivation of this result is shown in Appendix A.4. Using (5.65), the pinning
loss power density is given by
Pp = Fpv,
(5.79)
which agrees with (5.33), as predicted by the critical state model. Campbell’s model
is used here. It is proved, however, that (5.79) holds in general, independently of the
pinning model [15]. As shown here, the resultant pinning loss is not proportional to
the viscous coefﬁcient η but to the pinning force density, although the mechanism
of the loss is the viscosity. In addition, it is independent of the mean velocity v.
This clearly shows that the pinning loss is a hysteresis loss. The pinning loss power
density is derived to be zero for fp < fpt. In this case all the loss is the viscous loss.
Thus, the condition of effective pinning for the elementary pinning force, fp > fpt, is
the same as the condition that the loss is a hysteresis loss.
In the Yamafuji-Irie model [14], a different pinning model than (5.59) was
assumed and the pinning force density was derived from (5.77) and (5.79). The
obtained pinning force density is proportional to Npf 2
p , similar to the prediction of
the statistical theory of Labusch. Nevertheless, the important feature that the pinning
loss is independent of the viscous coefﬁcient, but depends only on the pinning force
density, is essentially the same as the present result.
On the other hand, very small loss energies owing to reversible ﬂux motion are
known. This indicates that the usual loss energy described by the critical state model
is caused by the unstable ﬂux motion inside and outside of the pinning potential. For
the assumed continuous periodic pinning potential, the ﬂux line velocity takes on a
much larger value than v in the regions of −af/4 < x < x0 and af/4 < x < 3af/4,

5.5 Pinning Loss Energy Density
101
i.e., in the continuous region of −3af/4 < x < x0, and this leads to an appreciable
loss, where x0 is given by (5.66).
As shown above, the description of the summation theory for ﬂux pinning and
that of the loss energy caused by unstable ﬂux motion are formally valid, and the
essential problem is summarized as the determination of the threshold value of the
elementary pinning force. In the next section, the summation theory is treated again
to explore the threshold value problem.
5.6
Coherent Potential Approximation Theory
Larkin and Onchinnikov [16] proposed a new summation theory after the threshold
value problem in the statistical theory of Labusch [11] was pointed out. The main
point of this theory was that, since the pinning correlation lengths are ﬁnite, individual
pinning forces in each correlated region are not perfectly cancelled out, resulting in
a nonzero macroscopic pinning force density. One of the correlated lengths is Camp-
bell’sACpenetrationdepth,givenby(5.52).Thislengthgivesthedistanceoverwhich
a perturbation such as displacement of ﬂux lines extends and becomes shorter for
stronger pinning. It was assumed in Labusch’s theory that a perfect ﬂux line lattice
with long-range order, which gives the lattice point 
, can be achieved by virtu-
ally switching off the interaction force of the representative pinning center alone.
Since strains remain in the ﬂux line lattice due to the many surrounding pinning
centers, as pointed out by Larkin and Onchinnikov, the assumption in Labusch’s
theory is not correct. There are also points, however, in the Larkin-Onchinnikov
theory. Although the pinning forces remain without being perfectly cancelled out in
each correlated region, there is no theoretical proof of the assumption that these forces
must be directed opposite to the Lorentz force. That is, it is impossible to explain
the assumption in terms of the randomness alone. If individual pinning forces obey a
Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ, the pinning force in each correlated
region can be approximated by a sum of pinning forces sampled randomly from the
Gaussian distribution. If the number of samples is N, the pinning forces in each corre-
lated region are known to obey another Gaussian distribution with standard deviation
√
Nσ. The expected pinning force density, which is proportional to the average of
this distribution, is zero. Since there is no interaction among correlated regions, the
speculation by Larkin and Ovchinnikov might be allowed. This is, however, only a
hope, and it is not possible to prove it. In addition, the correlation extends over the
whole superconductor in the critical state. The unstable ﬂux motion is inevitable for
a ﬁnite pinning force density, which is also effective in the critical state. In addition,
the distinction between the reversible and irreversible phenomena is not clear. In
particular, the mechanism causing the irreversibility is not clearly given.
For this reason, we have to employ the statistical summation theory that can
describe the irreversibility. Here, we will examine the problems in Labusch’s theory.
One of them is the point made by Larkin and Ovchinnikov on the pinning correlation
lengths. In order to achieve long- range order in the ﬂux line lattice, all pinning

interactions must be virtually switched off. In fact, if all pinning forces are zero, the
pinningcorrelationlengthdiverges,andperfectlong-rangeorderisachieved.Another
problem is that Labusch’s theory is not a mean ﬁeld theory, although the Labusch
parameter αL is used to represent the mean strength of the pinning interactions. Here,
a simple discrepancy is shown. Assume that the ﬂux pinning is not effective because
the pinning force is lower than the threshold. Thus, ﬂux lines can move to any place,
even with an inﬁnitesimal driving force. Hence, they can move to places effective
for pinning, resulting in a nonzero pinning force. In practice, ﬂux lines cannot freely
move under the interaction ﬁeld of the surrounding pinning centers. It is expected,
however, that thereis acompatiblesituationbetweenthestatisticallysummedpinning
force density and the interaction ﬁeld. This is the essential standpoint of the mean
ﬁeld theory. In Labusch’s theory, the spring constant in (5.60) is determined under the
ﬁxed condition of the ﬂux line lattice at inﬁnity. This may be based on the idea that
the elastic interaction does not extend to inﬁnity when only one pinning interaction
is switched on. The elastic constant takes on a large value due to this condition,
resulting in the large threshold value. The boundary condition at inﬁnity must be
free, however, if the pinning is not effective. In order to realize long-range order in
the ﬂux line lattice, all other pinning forces must also be virtually switched off. It is
important to clarify how this virtual step contributes to deriving the spring constant.
Here, the coherent potential approximation theory [17] is introduced. This theory
is a kind of mean ﬁeld theory used for random systems. The mean interaction ﬁeld of
surrounding pinning centers is assumed ﬁrst, and then, the pinning force density is
formally determined under the inﬂuence of the mean ﬁeld strength using a statistical
method. Finally, the pinning force density and mean ﬁeld strength are determined
self-consistently. In the case of ﬂux pinning phenomena in superconductors, the
Labusch parameter αL is used as a parameter representing the mean ﬁeld strength of
ﬂux pinning. The mean spacing of pinning centers is denoted by dp. Then, we have
Np = d−3
p . The easiest way to perform the statistical summation is to employ a model
in which each elementary region of ﬂux lines includes a single pinning center. In this
case, all elementary regions are equivalent to each other, and it is not necessary to
consider the interaction among pinning centers in each elementary region. Hence,
the volume of each elementary region is V = d3
p . The details of the shape of the
elementary region will be shown later.
If all the pinning interactions are virtually switched off at the same time to realize
the long-range order in the ﬂux line lattice, no information can be obtained. Hence,
we ﬁrst switch off the pinning force in a representative elementary region, as done
by Labusch. We assume that the ﬂux line interacting with the pinning center at x
moves to x0. The force balance in this case is
kf(x0 −x) + f (x) = 0,
(5.80)
where kf is the spring constant. The ﬁrst term is the restoring force against the
displacement by x0 −x. The result of Labusch’s theory can be used for kf. Next, we
assume that all remaining pinning interactions are switched off. In this case the ﬂux
line lattice is perfect, and the observed ﬂux line is assumed to move to 
. This means

5.6 Coherent Potential Approximation Theory
103
that the remaining pinning interactions exert an elastic restoring force proportional
to the displacement 
−x0. The corresponding spring constant is denoted by K. This
is related to the Labusch parameter representing the strength of the pinning ﬁeld.
It should be noted that the elastic force caused by the surrounding pinning centers,
K(
 −x0), is an internal force that is conveyed from one to another. Hence, it is
nothing else than the elastic restoring force on the observed ﬂux line given by the
ﬁrst term in (5.80). This force is balanced by the pinning force on the observed ﬂux
line:
K(
 −x0) + f (x) = 0.
(5.81)
From (5.80) and (5.81), we obtain the force balance of (5.60) with
k′−1
f
= k−1
f
+ K−1.
(5.82)
Figure 5.28 schematically illustrates the elastic condition around the pinning
center. The observed ﬂux line interacting with the pinning center is also interacting
elastically with other ﬂux lines within the correlation length. This elastic interaction
is due to the short-range distortion, and the corresponding spring constant is given
by kf. On the other hand, the ﬂux lines in the elementary region are interacting with
the surrounding pinning centers through the elasticity of the ﬂux line lattice, the
spring constant of which is K. The force balance treated here can be expressed as an
elastic interaction connected in series. Based on the present argument, each size of
the three-dimensional elementary region of ﬂux lines is determined in proportion to
the pinning correlation length in the corresponding direction (see Appendix A.5).
If we use k′
f given by (5.82), all the results in Sect. 5.4 can be used. Another
important point is shown here. This is a relationship with (5.53). The interaction
distance is generally in proportion to the ﬂux line spacing as
di = af
ζ ,
(5.83)
where ζ is a constant depending on the shape of the pinning centers, and we have
ζ = 2π for point pins. Hence, the pinning force density is given by

As mentioned above K is proportional to the Labusch parameter αL, and hence, the
right-hand side of (5.84) is proportional to the threshold value fpt. It should be noted
that fpt is a quantity proportional to the strength of the mean pinning ﬁeld, and (5.84)
is the condition to obtain fpt self-consistently. The details of the analysis are shown
in Appendix A.5. If we set

where C44 and C66 are the elastic moduli of ﬂux line lattice for bending deformation
and shear, respectively (see Appendix A.5). Usually, C44 ≫C66, and β is sufﬁciently
larger than unity.
Here the solution of t in (5.86) is simply investigated. The left-hand side takes
on a positive ﬁnite value at t = 0, decreases monotonically with increasing t, and
reaches 0 at t = 1. The right-hand side is 0 at t = 0, increases monotonically with
increasing t, and diverges at t = kfaf/4fp. Hence, t surely has a solution smaller than
1, independently of the value of kfaf/4fp. Namely, the threshold value is a function of
the elementary pinning force and never exceeds the elementary pinning force. Thus,
a consistent solution is obtained, as is known from the mean ﬁeld theory.
Here, we investigate the solution of t in (5.86), depending on the value of kfaf/4fp.
If kfaf/4fp is sufﬁciently large, as in the case of strong pinning, the left-hand side of
(5.86) is very large. Hence, there is a solution in the vicinity of
t = kfaf
4fp
(5.88)
at which the right-hand side diverges. Thus, from (5.65) we have
Fp = Npfp

(5.89)
The obtained result obeys the linear summation of (5.4), and the pinning efﬁciency
is given by [17]

ηp = 1 −kfaf/4fp
1 + kfaf/4fp
.
(5.90)
The value of ηp is almost constant, and the linear summation holds over a relatively
wide range of fp.
In the case of weak pinning, in which 4fp/kfaf is very small, the right-hand side of
(5.86) is small. This suggests that there is a solution in the vicinity of t = 1 around
which the left-hand side is small. We replace t by one except in the numerator on
the left-hand side and neglect t in the denominator on the right-hand side. Thus, we
have
t ∼= 1 −

(5.91)

(5.92)
The obtained pinning force density obeys the statistical summation given by (5.5)
[17]. As shown here, the coherent potential approximation theory explains the
experimental results over a wide range of the elementary pinning force in Fig. 5.4.
The most important result obtained in this section is that the threshold value of the
elementary pinning force exists formally, but it is always smaller than the elementary
pinning force. That is, no substantial threshold value exists. Hence, the pinning loss in
an AC magnetic ﬁeld of sufﬁciently large amplitude is hysteresis loss, which depends
only on the pinning force density, but not on the ﬂow resistivity, as described by the
critical state model.
The theoretical result obtained in this section can be extended to the ﬂux ﬂow
state above the critical current density. This is supported by the fact that the time
average and statistical average agree as

This supports the dynamic critical state model of (5.41).

Critical State Theory
The irreversibility was derived using the statistical mean ﬁeld approximation in
Sect. 5.4. On the other hand, individual elementary energetic interactions with defects
are reversible in nature, and this theoretical method also describes reversible behavior
in the ﬂux pinning phenomena, which can be observed experimentally. It is expected,
therefore, that the ﬂux pinning phenomena can be explained by ﬁrst principles to
minimize the relevant free energy, similarly to superconductivity, which is explained
by minimizing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy.
In the critical state model, the balance between the Lorentz force and the pinning
force is essential, and the energies related to the force balance are only the magnetic
energy and the pinning energy. Practical superconductors to which the critical state
model is applicable are type II superconductors with high κ values, and the conden-
sation energy and the kinetic energy are relatively small enough to disregard. Thus,
the free energy density to be treated is
F =
1
2μ0
B2 + Up,
(5.94)
where Up is the pinning energy density.
We assume that the ﬂux line system is isolated and that there is no energy ﬂow
acrosstheboundarytothesurroundings.Thissituationcorrespondstothatintheﬁeld-
cooled process, which is attained by cooling down the superconductor after applying
a magnetic ﬁeld. This situation also corresponds to the statistical distribution of
magnetic ﬂux lines in the middle panel of Fig. 5.25 and to the origin of Fig. 5.16.
The ﬂux line lattice is distorted by pinning interactions activated by cooling down,
and current ﬂows locally. The total current within the superconductor is zero, and
the mean magnetic ﬂux density is unchanged from the initial value, B0. It is assumed
that the magnetic ﬂux density varies slightly as B = B0 + b. Then, the magnetic
energy density changes as

(5.95)
The displacement of ﬂux lines that causes this change in the magnetic ﬂux density is
denoted by u. Since the displacement of ﬂux lines along their length is meaningless,
u is perpendicular to B0. Using the continuity equation for ﬂux lines, we have
b = ∇× (u × B0) = (B0 · ∇)u −B0∇· u = B0

The unit vectors along the respective directions are denoted by iζ and iξ. Then, the
magnetic energy density, apart from the ﬁrst constant term, is written as

where C11 is the elastic moduli of ﬂux line lattice for uniaxial compression (see
Appendix A.5). The ﬁrst and second terms correspond to the magnetic pressure
(Fig. 5.6) and the line tension (Fig. 5.7), respectively. Equation (A5.1) for elastic
moduli of the ﬂux line in Appendix A.5 is derived from this equation.
Before proceeding to the next step, we will discuss the magnetic energy density
given by (5.97) in more detail. On averaging the magnetic energy density, the ﬁrst
term is zero and the second and third terms remain. In this equation the bending and
uniaxial compressional strains are respectively given by
∂u
∂ζ = ϵζ, ∂u
∂ξ = ϵξ.

Hence, (5.97) represents the strain energy density and can be described as
Fm = 1

(5.107)
The ﬁrst and second terms are caused by the compressional and bending strains,
respectively. The Lorentz force is an elastic restoring force against such strains of
the ﬂux lines. The increase in energy caused by such strains in the isolated ﬂux line
system is absorbed by the negative pinning energy, and the condition of force balance
expressed by (5.104) is obtained. If there are no pinning interactions, such strains
are not produced.
As shown above, the force balance (5.104) on the isolated ﬂux line system can
be derived from ﬁrst principles. Then, this will be extended to non-isolated ﬂux
line systems. This is the process in which the statistical distribution of ﬂux lines
changes from the middle panel to the lower panel in Fig. 5.25 and corresponds to the
variation from the origin to point A in Fig. 5.16. There is a slight difference in the
calculations between the case of magnetic pressure in Fig. 5.6 and that of the line
tension in Fig. 5.7. Here, we treat the case of the line tension. Please refer to [19] for
the magnetic pressure.
Assume a wide superconducting slab that occupies −d ≤z ≤d. When a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld with the magnetic ﬂux density B0 is applied along the direction of the
z-axis, the magnetic ﬂux penetrates the slab uniformly due to the demagnetization
factor. Then, a current of density J is applied along the y-axis. The magnetic ﬂux
density inside the slab is
B = (Bx(z), 0, B0), Bx(z) = μ0Jz.
(5.108)
Hence, the electric ﬁeld induced along the y-axis while applying the current is

In the above we used the condition that the electric ﬁeld is zero at the center z = 0,
where the magnetic ﬂux density does not change from symmetry. We assume that
the current density is increased from J to J + δJ in a short period δt. The power that
penetrates into the region between z and z + δz through a unit area in the x-y plane
in this period is calculated using Poynting’s vector as

(5.116)
where δBx(z) = μ0δJz is the increment of the x component of the magnetic ﬂux

δu(0) = 0. If we denote the elastic restoring force density by f, we have
f = 1
δz lim
δJ→0
δW
δu = JB0.
(5.117)
Thus, the driving force density f is the Lorentz force, i.e., the line tension. On the
other hand, the pinning force density is derived from the pinning energy density Up
and is formally the same as that for the isolated ﬂux line system. Hence, the force
balance (5.104) is obtained also for non-isolated systems [19].
As shown above, the energy penetrating the superconductor during the virtual
displacement, which is obtained using Poynting’s vector, is larger than the increase
in the magnetic energy, and the additional energy density δW is independent of the
magnetic ﬂux distribution and cannot be seen in it. This will be discussed in more
detail in Appendix A.7. In the above case the additional energy is absorbed as an
increase in the pinning energy to realize the assumed magnetic ﬂux distribution,
i.e., the increase from the initial isolated state to the new equilibrium state after the
displacement driven by the restoring force. Since the pinning energy is a kind of
thermodynamic energy, it cannot be seen from the viewpoint of electromagnetism.
The same result is obtained for the case of magnetic pressure.
As shown above, the driving force is proved to be the Lorentz force, and the Gibbs
free energy density is generally described as
(5.118)
The force balance equation in the critical state model is derived from the condition
of the minimum Gibbs free energy,
(see Appendix A.8).
The pinning force discussed up to now is reversible in nature and derived from the
pinning energy. Finally, it is necessary to extend such a reversible pinning force to
the irreversible one under practical conditions. This is done by the summation theory
for ﬂux pinning in Sect. 5.4. In the ﬁnal state, the pinning force density F changes
to the irreversible pinning force density with the maximum value Fp, and the force
balance (5.104) changes to (5.6) in the critical state model.
As shown here, the critical state model that can explain various experimental
results is no longer a phenomenological model but a rigorous theory. In particular, the
summation theory used in the proof is regarded as a useful theory that can statistically
derive a macroscopic irreversibility from the random interactions of many bodies
among pinning potentials. The resultant irreversibility is caused by the biased ﬂux
distribution due to unstable ﬂux motion inside pinning potentials. Hence, the origin
of the irreversibility in this case is independent of the usual breaking of time reversal
symmetry. Namely, the irreversibility in the ﬂux pinning results from the difference

5.7 Critical State Theory
111
in the equation of motion before and after the instability. When ﬂux lines move even
slightly along the positive direction from the position at x = −(3af/4) in Fig. 5.25,
these ﬂux lines move discontinuously to x = x0 in the pinning potential. After that,
even if the ﬂux lines move in the opposite direction, they must go back continuously
until they reach x = −af/4. That is, the situation is different from that before the
instability. It is also shown that the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is not satisﬁed, if
there is no energy dissipation. For the two kinds of irreversibility, refer to Appendix
A.9.
Here, we consider the irreversibility in superconductors microscopically. The
derivation of irreversibility is difﬁcult, for example, for the motion of molecules,
because of the time reversal symmetry of the equation of motion. On the other
hand, the mechanism of the irreversibility is different in superconductors. Whereas
molecules move freely in various directions, atoms, including those in defects that
can pin ﬂux lines, which are responsible for energy dissipation, are restrained and
thermally vibrating around their equilibrium positions in a solid superconductor.
When a current is applied to the superconductor in a magnetic ﬁeld, the Lorentz force
acts on it. It is assumed that the superconductor is ﬁxed, so as not to move under the
Lorentz force. Each atom around the defects is slightly displaced by the ﬂux pinning
interaction. In fact, distortion can be observed in superconductors, when the Lorentz
force is present. In the condition where voltage appears, the Lorentz force causes
motion of the ﬂux lines. When ﬂux lines are depinned, the atoms around defects that
have pinned ﬂux lines become free and start to oscillate. That is, the atoms acquire
energy through interaction with ﬂux lines from the source that supplies the current. As
discussed in the summation theory, pinning centers are distributed randomly without
any correlation with non-distorted lattice points (
) with long-range order. Each ﬂux
line is depinned when it reaches 
 = δ(x = −3af/4) and the corresponding time t0
is also random among the depinned ﬂux lines for the above reason. If we denote the
amplitude and angular frequency of oscillation of each atom by A and ω, respectively,
the moment of each atom of weight m is represented as Amωcos[ω(t −t0)]. Hence,
if n is the number of atoms that oscillate around one pinning center, the moment that
the superconductor of unit volume acquires during one cycle is given by
NpnAmω
2π


0
cos[ω(t −t0)]d(ωt0) = 0,
(5.119)
where ﬂuctuation is disregarded. Thus, it is not possible to take out kinetic energy
from such motions of atoms. As a consequence, the oscillation energy becomes
thermal energy, and the phenomenon is irreversible. If the motion of atoms is synchro-
nized throughout the superconductor, the oscillation energy can be taken out as an
ultrasonic energy.
Here, it is shown that ﬂux lines driven by the Lorentz force transfer their energies
irreversibly to the regions around pinning centers through pinning interactions. We
do not discuss the consequent diffusion of the energy inside the superconductor,

however, since this process essentially contains the problem of the breaking of time
reversal symmetry.
Coffee break (5)
Principle of minimum energy dissipation
It is assumed in the critical state model that the ﬂux pinning interaction minimizes the
change in the magnetic ﬂux distribution caused by a change in the external magnetic
ﬁeld, etc. Here, we discuss the relationship between this assumption and the principle
of minimum energy dissipation in irreversible thermodynamics. Assume that the
magnetic ﬁeld H0, which is applied along the z-axis of a very wide superconductor
(x ≥0), is increased from 0 to Hm. We assume that the current density is given
by λJc(0 < λ ≤1). Note that the condition of λ smaller than 1 is realized for the
reversible ﬂux motion. In this case, the magnetic ﬂux density near the surface is given
by
B(x) = μ0(H0 −λJcx)
in the region of 0 ≤x ≤H0/λJc ≡x0. The velocity of magnetic ﬂux lines in the
vicinity of the surface is obtained from (5.34) as
Bv(x) = −

The loss energy is at a minimum at λ = 1, i.e., the condition of maximum pinning,
as assumed in the critical state model. In the above, λ = 0 corresponds to a special
case, and the divergence of energy dissipation comes from the divergence of x0. Since
practical superconductors have ﬁnite sizes, the loss energy density is zero.

5.7 Critical State Theory
113
It should be noted that the result of the summation theory shown in Sects. 5.4 and
5.6 automatically satisﬁes this condition. Since the summation theory leads to the
same result as the critical state model, it is also consistent with ﬁrst principles. The
state described by these theories in the quasi-static process is just in contact with the
state derived by the principle of minimum energy dissipation (see Appendix A.10).

Chapter 6
Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
Abstract Under the usual electromagnetic conditions, magnetic ﬂux lines and
current are perpendicular to each other, and electromagnetic phenomena are deter-
mined by the balance between the Lorentz force and the pinning force. On the
other hand, various peculiar phenomena are observed when a current is applied to
a superconductor in a parallel magnetic ﬁeld. These phenomena are introduced in
this chapter. These phenomena are also determined by a general driving force on
ﬂux lines and the pinning force to maintain the distorted structure of the ﬂux lines.
The Lorentz force is zero, however, because the current and magnetic ﬂux lines are
parallel to each other. Hence, another force is driving the ﬂux lines. Following the
general idea that the driving force is a restoring force to release the distortion, it is
easy to suppose that it is a torque to rotate the ﬂux lines. In fact, this torque can
be derived similarly from the principle of virtual displacement as was done in the
derivation of the Lorentz force in Chap. 5. Various peculiar phenomena associated
with the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect are generally explained by the rotational
ﬂux motion caused by the torque. These phenomena can occur only in superconduc-
tors with the pinning effect, and new phenomena that have not been considered in
electromagnetism can be seen.
6.1
Experimental Results
The magnetic ﬁeld produced by a current is usually normal to the current, and elec-
tromagnetic phenomena in superconductors are determined by the balance between
the Lorentz force on ﬂux lines and the pinning force, as described by the critical state
model. Such a magnetic ﬁeld is called a transverse magnetic ﬁeld.
When a magnetic ﬁeld is applied along the length of a superconducting wire or
slab, and then, a current is applied, as shown in Fig. 6.1, electromagnetic phenomena
completely different from those in transverse magnetic ﬁelds are observed. Since
such a magnetic ﬁeld is called a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, these phenomena are
classed together as the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect. The main phenomena are
introduced here.

Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
Fig. 6.1 Conditions for the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
(1) Increase in critical current density
The critical current density decreases monotonically with increasing transverse
magnetic ﬁeld, except for the peak effect.1 This is caused by the decrease in
the condensation energy density with increasing magnetic ﬁeld. In the longitu-
dinal magnetic ﬁeld, however, the critical current density increases with increasing
magnetic ﬁeld and takes on a much larger value than that in the transverse magnetic
ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 6.2 [1]. This increase cannot be explained by a simple super-
position of the magnetic ﬁeld components. That is, the transverse magnetic ﬁeld
component is produced by the current, and if the Lorentz force caused by this ﬁeld
component determines the critical state, the critical current density cannot exceed
the value in the self-ﬁeld, i.e., the condition of zero external magnetic ﬁeld. It is spec-
ulated, therefore, that some interaction between the applied longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld and the transverse magnetic ﬁeld caused by the current determines the distri-
butions of the magnetic ﬁeld and the current, i.e., the critical state in the whole
superconductor.
1Peak effect: Phenomenon in the critical current density that shows a peak at some magnetic ﬁeld
caused by a suitable matching between ﬂux lines and distributed pinning centers. Such a matching
is realized by softened elasticity of ﬂux lines due to a phase transition. In this case the critical current
density starts to increase at some magnetic ﬁeld and never starts at zero magnetic ﬁeld, as shown
in Fig. 6.2.

(2) Paramagnetic effect
Usually, superconductors show diamagnetism when an external magnetic ﬁeld is
applied. When a current is applied to a superconducting wire or slab in the diamag-
netic state in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, magnetic ﬂux penetrates the supercon-
ductor, resulting in a paramagnetic state. Figure 6.3 shows variations in the magne-
tization (upper panel) and the voltage (lower panel) when a current is applied to a
superconducting cylinder in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld [2]. It can be seen that
the magnetization changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic when the current is
increased. The dashed line in the magnetization is the theoretical prediction of the
force-free model that will be described later.

(3) Reduction in loss energy due to AC current
The AC current loss energy is the loss energy produced by the self-ﬁeld of the current.
The loss energy is decreased by applying a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 6.4
shows the observed loss energy density in Nb-Ti wires that carry AC current of a ﬁxed
amplitude as a function of the longitudinal DC magnetic ﬁeld [3]. The loss energy
density decreases with increasing longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. This can be attributed
to the increase in the critical current density with the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld.
(4) Breaking of Josephson’s formula for induced electric ﬁeld
When the longitudinal and azimuthal electric ﬁeld components were measured for a
superconducting wire carrying a DC and superposed small AC current in a parallel
magnetic ﬁeld by the four-probe method and the pick-up coil method, respectively,
the total electric ﬁeld was found to be directed almost parallel to the DC magnetic
ﬁeld [4]. Since the magnetic ﬁeld due to the current was sufﬁciently smaller than the
applied DC magnetic ﬁeld, this observation shows that Josephson’s formula (4.41)
does not hold. If this formula holds, the observed electric ﬁeld must be normal to the
DC magnetic ﬁeld. Since both (2.49) and (5.34) hold, we have
E = B × v −∇φ.
(6.1)
This relationship is of the same form as the electric ﬁeld in materials that are not
superconductors. Note that φ is not an electrostatic potential, since the electric ﬁeld
including the second term is an electric ﬁeld induced by the AC magnetic ﬁeld.
(5) Resistive state
The phenomenon described in (4) applies for a DC current that is lower than the crit-
ical current in a superconductor, and hence, that in a resistive state is not included. In

superconducting rod [5].
There is a region where the
voltage takes on a negative
value
the resistive state where the current is higher than the critical current, a surface elec-
tric ﬁeld structure including a negative electric ﬁeld region is observed. Figure 6.5
shows examples of the observed current versus the longitudinal voltage characteris-
tics: It can be found that the observed voltage is negative with respect to the current
direction at some position [5]. The surface electric ﬁeld structure speciﬁed by the
observed results is shown in Fig. 6.6 [5]. It can be seen that the cylindrical symmetry
is broken and that regions with positive and negative electric ﬁelds with respect to
the current direction form a helical structure. As will be shown later, Josephson’s
formula does not hold in this case either, and the electric ﬁeld has the form of (6.1)
again. This electric ﬁeld is an induced electric ﬁeld similar to that in the usual ﬂux
ﬂow state.
The interpretation of the above experimental results reported in the 1970s is as
follows:
(a)
The force-free model that assumes that the magnetic ﬂux density B and the
current density J are locally parallel to each other was expected to hold [6]. This
modelexplainstheexperimentalresultssuchastheparamagneticmagnetization,
etc. This model can be described as
J × B = 0.
(6.2)
This means that the Lorentz force on the ﬂux lines is zero.
(b) Josephson derived (6.2) as an equation representing the equilibrium state in
pin-free superconductors [7]. The result of Josephson’s theory was considered
to hold in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The equilibrium state
in superconductors with pinning centers is given by (5.6).
(c)
It was believed that ﬂux lines that have penetrated the superconductor move
translationally while keeping their angles [8]. If ﬂux lines rotate, the induced

in Fig. 6.5 [5]. The region
with the negative voltage is

electric ﬁeld and energy loss change, depending on the distance from the rota-
tion center, as expected from (4.41) and (5.32), which contradicts the observed
uniformity in these quantities. Namely, it was believed that the correspon-
dence with mechanical systems holds, similarly to the phenomena in the usual
transverse magnetic ﬁeld as described by the critical state model.
(d) Flux cutting models were proposed to explain various electromagnetic
phenomena [2, 4, 9, 10]. For example, the longitudinal electric ﬁeld in the
resistive state in Fig. 6.3 was attributed to the continuous penetration of the
azimuthal component of the magnetic ﬂux into the cylindrical superconductor
with elimination at the center. On the other hand, this was considered to be
contradictory to the observed constant longitudinal magnetization with time, if
ﬂux lines penetrate continuously. It was assumed that only the azimuthal ﬂux
component penetrates so as to be compatible with the constant longitudinal
magnetization [2]. The situation is similar to the case of an induced longitu-
dinal electric ﬁeld explained in (4), which showed a deviation from Josephson’s
formula E = B×v [4]. The authors proposed a ﬂux cutting model assuming that
the small azimuthal ﬂux component goes in and out of the cylindrical specimen
while the longitudinal component is stationary, as shown in Fig. 6.7, to explain
the observed induced electric ﬁeld roughly parallel to the magnetic ﬂux.
(e)
If the force-free state is stable, there is no mechanism to determine the critical
current density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. Thus, it was

magnetic ﬂux component
(Bz) and the azimuthal
component (Bφ) [4]
assumed that the threshold value of the ﬂux cutting event determines the critical
current density [11].
(f)
There was no essential argument on the reason for the negative electric ﬁeld
observed in the resistive state.
In the above, it is considered that the force-free model explains the experimental
results, although the reason why it holds is not clear. Other ideas are doubtful.
Although the theory of Josephson may be expected to be the basis of the validity
of the force-free model, this theory deals with pin-free superconductors. In super-
conductors in which the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is observed, the effect
of ﬂux pinning is found to be as shown in Fig. 6.2. In addition, the critical current
density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld also depends directly on the ﬂux pinning
strength, similarly to that in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 6.8a shows the
variation in the critical current density in the transverse and longitudinal magnetic
ﬁelds through the introduction of pinning centers by neutron irradiation [12]. The
critical current density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld increases with introduction
of pinning centers as does that in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 6.8b shows
the correlation between the critical current densities in the transverse and longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁelds in Nb-50at.%Ta, in which the sizes and concentrations of
Nb2N normal precipitates working as pinning centers were changed [13]. A strong
correlation can be seen between them. These results indicate that the critical current
density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld goes to zero when there are no pinning
centers in the superconductor, similarly to what occurs in the transverse magnetic
ﬁeld. In addition, the irreversibility in the observed magnetic phenomena also shows
that ﬂux pinning is involved in them. Hence, the theory of Josephson, which insists

b Correlation between the critical current density in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld (Jc⊥) and that in
the longitudinal one (Jc∥) for Nb-50at.%Ta with Nb2N normal precipitates [13]
that a force-free current parallel to ﬂux lines can stably ﬂow without ﬂux pinning
seems to be incorrect.
The author investigated personally an experimental result concerned with (c) as
follows. It was based only on the information that the critical current was 30 A
for a superconducting rod 0.8 mm in diameter in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld of
14 mT. The self-ﬁeld at the critical current is 7.5 mT. How much magnetic ﬂux
invades the superconductor during an increase in the self-ﬁeld? Since the mean
spacing of ﬂux lines just before applying the current is 380 nm, when the ﬂux lines
near the surface move inward by this distance, the ﬁrst row of ﬂux lines penetrate the
superconductor. This situation is realized when the current reaches 1.72 A. As shown
in Appendix A.11, it was expected that ﬂux lines did not penetrate translationally
while maintaining their angle, but penetrated rotationally while changing their angle
to result in a continuous variation in the magnetization under the boundary condition
of the surface ﬁeld. In addition, if the ﬁrst row of ﬂux lines penetrates translationally,
the area of the transport current ﬂow is restricted only in the region of the ﬂux line
penetration, resulting in a current density very much higher than the critical current
density. When the current reaches the critical value, the current ﬂows only in the
region down to the depth of 0.12 mm from the surface, which is far different from
the usual concept of the critical state. It cannot be explained why the superconductor
goes into the resistive state when the current is increasesd more. That is, the ﬂux
lines must have a structure so that the current ﬂows in the whole area. Hence, the
axial ﬂux lines that are already inside the superconductor must also rotate. This will
be discussed again in Sect. 6.4. It is possible to try to explain this phenomenon by
the mechanism of ﬂux cutting. This will be discussed in the next paragraph.

6.1 Experimental Results
123
If the ﬂux cutting event occurs as assumed in (d), the ﬂux lines that cut each
other must grow close, as shown in Fig. 6.9, and it is considered that a signiﬁcantly
strong Lorentz force works locally on the ﬂux lines to maintain their distance. There
is no theoretical proof of the existence of a force that makes the ﬂux lines grow
closer to each other, overcoming the repulsive Lorentz force. Hence, it seems to
be impossible for the ﬂux cutting event to actually take place. The assumption was
made that, when there are three ﬂux lines A, B and C as illustrated in Fig. 6.10, the
strong repulsive force from A to B helps the ﬂux cutting between B and C. This
is not realistic, however. When B approaches C, the force that pushes B to C is
weakened. This force never exceeds the repulsive force between B and C. Even if the
ﬂux cutting event occurs based on this process, the needed current density exceeds
the depairing current density. This means that the superconductivity is surely broken
before the ﬂux cutting occurs. Reconnection of magnetic ﬂux lines in plasma may be
imagined as a similar phenomenon. Such a phenomenon occurs when an extremely
largeenergydissipationeventtakesplace.Ontheotherhand,thereisalmostnoenergy
dissipation during quasi-static variations in the superconductor. Hence, it is difﬁcult
or impossible for ﬂux cutting similar to the reconnection to take place. Nevertheless,
there are many young researchers who think that the ﬂux cutting must explain the
experimental results. It should be noted that there is a theoretical contradiction in
this understanding. Josephson’s theory that describes the relationship between the
velocity of ﬂux lines and the electric ﬁeld does not hold. Hence, there is no reason to
directly relate the electric ﬁeld to the velocity of ﬂux lines. In other words, the virtual
process of ﬂux cutting is meaningless, since it is based on Josephson’s theory.
As to (e), the threshold value of the current density needed for the ﬂux cutting is
too high, and it exceeds the depairing current density. Hence, the idea of attributing
the critical current density to the ﬂux cutting is not realistic. In addition, the observed

critical current densities depend on the ﬂux pinning strength. This indicates that some
ﬂux pinning mechanism determines the critical current density.
As to (f), there was an argument that the negative electric ﬁeld might be introduced
by the ﬂux cutting, even though the negative electric ﬁeld could not be explained by
the ﬂux cutting. In particular, the reason for the breaking of cylindrical symmetry
associatedwiththesurfaceelectricﬁeldstructureshowninFig.6.6wasnotexplained.
Various problems related to the ﬂux cutting are generally discussed in Appendix
A.12.
6.2
Clue to the Solution
Since the essential mechanism of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects was not
clariﬁed, it is necessary to ﬁnd a clue to the solution. The key point is the experimental
resultthatthecriticalcurrentdensitydependsontheﬂuxpinningstrength,similarlyto
that in the usual transverse magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 6.8. This fact suggests that
the ﬂux pinning interaction stabilizes the distorted structure of ﬂux lines introduced
by the current. Under the usual transverse magnetic ﬁeld, the distortion of ﬂux lines
caused by the current is a density gradient or bending deformation, as shown in
Figs. 5.6b or 5.7b, respectively. The Lorentz force works to reduce these distortions.
Even in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, a non-dissipative current can be carried in a
stable manner, since the distorted structure of ﬂux lines is expected to be stabilized
by ﬂux pinning interactions against the restoring force to release the distortion. Then,
what kind of distortion exists in the ﬂux lines in the force-free state?
Here we describe the magnetic ﬂux density as

(6.4)
Since the ﬁrst term is normal to B, it is not a force-free component. The second term
is important. It is assumed for simplicity that the vector B stays in the x-z plane. Its
angle from the z-axis is denoted by θ. Using the unit vectors ix and iz along the x-
and z-axis, iB is written as
iB = ixsinθ + izcosθ.
(6.5)
If we assume that the angle θ varies only along the y-axis, the second term in (6.4)
is reduced to

where

(6.7)
The ﬁrst term in (6.6) is the current caused by the Lorentz force, i.e., the magnetic
pressure, as expected. The second current is parallel to the magnetic ﬂux density,
i.e., the force-free current. This shows that, when the force-free current ﬂows, the
magnetic ﬂux structure has distortion as shown in Fig. 6.11. That is, the angle of the
ﬂux lines staying on a plane changes along the direction perpendicular to the plane.
This distortion is different from the density gradient and bending deformation shown
in Figs. 5.6b and 5.7b, respectively.

Here, we realize the force-free state in a superconducting slab occupying 0 ≤y ≤

then, the current I is applied in the same direction. The self-ﬁeld along the x-axis
due to the current is denoted by HI. From symmetry we focus on half of the slab,
0 ≤y ≤d. The magnetic ﬂux density inside the slab has no y-component, and we
can assume
B = (Bsinθ, 0, Bcosθ),
(6.8)
where θ is the angle of the magnetic ﬂux density measured from the z-axis. It can
be assumed that the spatial variation occurs only along the y-axis. Then, the current

Hence, the variation rate of the angle αf is large, when the current density J is large.

is the depth down to which the force-free state penetrates.
The transport current along the z-axis ﬂowing in a unit length of the x-axis is
HI, and hence, it is self-consistent. The critical state is the state at which the current
reaches the center, y = d. In this condition we have
θ0 = αfd ≡θc.

The self-ﬁeld in this condition is

In the force-free state the magnetic ﬂux density given by (6.8) and the current

has the same structure. As a result, we have

αf
B2
(6.22)
has a non-zero value. Hence, in this state the magnetic helicity2 is not zero. In
normal conductors or superconductors under the transverse magnetic ﬁeld discussed
in Chap. 5, A and B are perpendicular to each other, and the quantity given by
(6.22) is zero. Nonzero magnetic helicity in the static condition is only realized in
superconductors in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. We can easily show that ∇× J =
αfJ ̸= 0 for the force-free current. If Ohm’s law holds as in normal materials, we
have ∇× E ̸= 0 by multiplying the normal state resistivity, which contradicts the
principle of the electrostatic ﬁeld given by (2.19). Hence, it can be said that the

longitudinal ﬁeld effect is realized only in superconductors. The magnetic helicity
is discussed in Appendix A.13.
Here, we show that the paramagnetic effect can be obtained in the force-free state.

(6.24)
The longitudinal component of the magnetic ﬂux density is larger than the magnetic
ﬂux density of the external magnetic ﬁeld μ0He, as can be seen from Fig. 6.13. Hence,
the paramagnetic effect can be shown. In case of He ≫HI, we have M ∼= H 2
I /2He.
It is shown above that the force-free state explains the paramagnetic effect shown
in Fig. 6.2. In this state, the ﬂux lines are distorted, as shown in Fig. 6.11. From the
analogy with the Lorentz force, therefore, a restoring reaction to release the distortion
is expected. Since the condition θ(y) = 0 is the state in which there is no current,
the reaction is not a simple force, but rather is a torque that acts to rotate the ﬂux
lines, as indicated by arrows. This torque is expected to be derived from the energy
increase when the distortion is virtually introduced, similarly to the derivation of
the Lorentz force in Sect. 5.7. It is also expected that such a rotation of ﬂux lines is
able to solve the contradiction stated in (c) in Sect. 6.1. In addition, if we assume
that the ﬂux lines are rotated by a small angle θ from the z-axis to the x-axis, the
variation in the z component of the magnetic ﬂux is of the order of (θ)2, which is
negligible, while the variation in the x component is of the order of θ. Hence, the
induced electric ﬁeld is almost directed along the z-axis. Thus, the explanation of
the breaking of Josephson’s formula is also expected.
As shown in this section, various unique properties that cannot be found in the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld are observed in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld.

In this section the force-free torque is derived from the principle of virtual displace-
ment, similarly to the derivation of the Lorentz force in Sect. 5.7. Since the derivation
of the pure torque is our aim, we assume a virtual displacement to directly achieve the

structure shown in Fig. 6.11, which is different from the common process of applying
a magnetic ﬁeld and then applying a transport current. This can be achieved by
rotating the applied magnetic ﬁeld. In the usual process the penetration of magnetic
ﬂuxdrivenbytheLorentzforcealsooccursduetotheself-ﬁeld,resultinginacomplex
situation. Some experiments corresponding to the assumed process have been done.
In this case, a uniform rotation of the magnetic ﬂux is not easy, and hence, the super-
conductor is rotated in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, since the condition is relativistically
the same.
Thus, we assume that an external magnetic ﬁeld He is applied along the z-axis
parallel to a superconducting slab, and then, the magnetic ﬁeld is rotated to achieve
the magnetic structure given by (6.8) and (6.15). In the case B = μ0He. It is assumed
that the penetration depth of the rotation y0 does not change and that only αf increases
for the purpose of using a simple process to introduce the rotational strain. Under
these conditions, it is better to rewrite (6.15) as
θ = αf(y0 −y).

(6.32)
Thus, the force-free torque density is proportional to the magnetic ﬂux density and
the current density, both of which correspond to the strength of the distortion. This
is similar to the Lorentz force.
When the force-free current ﬂows, the magnetic energy does not change, since
the magnetic ﬂux density does not change. The energy associated with the force-free
distortion shown in Fig. 6.11 penetrates the superconductor, however. This must be
the work done by the torque, which is similar to the work done by the Lorentz force in
the usual transverse magnetic ﬁeld (see Appendix A.7). Under practical conditions,
this additional energy is absorbed as an increase in the pinning energy, i.e., a kind
of thermodynamic energy. As a consequence, the distorted ﬂux line structure is
stabilized by the pinning interaction. If there is no pinning interaction, the distorted
structure cannot be stabilized, resulting in a resistive state. Thus, the static critical
state is determined by the torque balance between the force-free torque density and
the pinning torque density p [14]
 + p = 0.
(6.33)
This result is derived by minimizing the Gibbs free energy and is similar to the deriva-
tion of the force-balance (5.6) (see Appendix A.8). Equation (6.33) is consistent with
the experimental results showing that the critical current density depends on the ﬂux
pinning strength. On the other hand, the above theoretical treatment essentially denies
the mechanism of ﬂux cutting [15]. That is, ﬂux cutting is a mechanism of magnetic
interaction between ﬂux lines, and hence, it is independent of the ﬂux pinning. In
addition, the energy that was introduced as work done by the driving torque cannot be
stored as a pinning energy. Thus, the principle of energy conservation is not fulﬁlled.
See the details in (2) in Appendix A.12.

Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
Note the fact that the magnetic torque appears in spite of the lack of any magnetic
force, i.e., the Lorentz force. Such a situation cannot be found in dynamics, in which
the torque is a moment of a force. Namely, no torque exists, if there is no force. The
force-free torque density is independent of the size of the superconductor, whereas the
mechanical torque density becomes large as the distorted body becomes large. This
is because the relative displacement becomes large between two points in adjacent
planes as the distance from the rotation center becomes large. This is essentially
different from the correspondence between the electromagnetic phenomena in the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld and mechanical phenomena in dynamics. This will be
discussed in more detail in Sect. 6.6.
Here, we show the experimental result that directly demonstrates that the critical
current density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is determined by the torque balance.
One of the main factors in the summation in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is the
elementary pinning torque, while its counterpart in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is the
elementary pinning force fp. The elementary pinning torque is given by the product
of the elementary pinning force and the spacing of two adjacent pinning centers,
dp = N −1/3
p
, i.e., the moment of the pinning force fpdp. In Fig. 6.14, the critical
current density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is compared with the product of
the elementary pinning torque fpdp and the number density of pinning centers Np,
i.e., the prediction of the direct summation of the pinning torque density for Pb–
Bi superconductor with normal Bi precipitates as pinning centers [16]. Since the
observed critical current density is proportional to this product, we can say that a
linear summation holds for the pinning torque density. As a result, the critical current
density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is proportional to N 2/3
p
fp. On the other hand,
the critical current density of this superconductor in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is
proportionaltoNpfp andobeysthelinearsummationof(5.4).Hence,whenthepinning
becomes stronger due to an increase in Np, the difference in the critical current density
between the two magnetic ﬁelds becomes smaller, as shown in Fig. 6.8b. Thus, the
result in Fig. 6.14 also explains such a trend.

The ﬂux pinning interactions determine the critical current density, as discussed
above. This is supported by the experimental result that observed electromagnetic
phenomena are irreversible. When an alternating transport current or a small alter-
nating transverse magnetic ﬁeld is applied to a long superconducting slab in a longi-
tudinal direct magnetic ﬁeld, an alternating magnetic ﬂux penetrates, as shown in
Fig. 6.15. This is a linear distribution similarly to the description by the critical state
model shown in Fig. 5.9 and suggests that the force-free state given by (6.8) and
(6.15) is attained throughout the superconductor (note that the angle θ is sufﬁciently
small because of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld of 0.290 T) [17].
Although such experiments show that the force-free state is realized, this state does
not suddenly appear only by application of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. From the
concept of the critical state model, it seems to be natural to assume that the area in
which the force-free state is attained gradually penetrates the superconductor with
increasing applied current. Here, we investigate the ﬂux motion during the process
in which the force-free state is established.
We assume that the magnetic ﬁeld He is applied along the z-axis to a sufﬁciently
wide superconducting slab that occupies 0 ≤y ≤2d. For simplicity it is assumed
that the magnetic ﬂux density is uniform and given by μ0He in the superconductor.
Then, the transport current I is applied along the z-axis. We can assume that there is no
spatial variation along the x- and z-axes because of the width of the superconductor.
From symmetry it is enough to consider half of the slab, 0 ≤y ≤d. If the width
is denoted by w, the self-ﬁeld of the current is HI = I/2w, and the magnetic ﬂux
density on the superconductor surface (y = 0) is given by

The practical magnetic ﬂux distribution is formally given by (6.8) and (6.15), as
discussed before, whereas the variation rate of the angle αf is not given by (6.17) but
is a constant given by
αf = μ0Jc

(6.35)
In this case the angle of the magnetic ﬂux density is

The area from the surface (y = 0) to the depth θ0/αf is in the force-free state.
Here we denote the velocity of the ﬂux lines as
v =

vx, vy, vz

.
(6.38)
In the above, only vy represents the penetration of magnetic ﬂux contributing to
the variation in the magnetic ﬂux density. From symmetry, we can assume that this
component does not depend on x and z. Since the ﬂux motion in x-z planes does not
bring about any variation in the magnetic ﬂux density, the divergence of v must be
zero in these planes. Thus, the condition
∂vx
∂x + ∂vz
∂z = 0
(6.39)
must be satisﬁed. Since the velocity v is deﬁned to be normal to the magnetic ﬂux
density B, the condition of (6.39) is written as
vxsinθ + vzcosθ = 0.
(6.40)
Using (6.39) and (6.40), the continuity equation for ﬂux lines (5.34) is written as

(6.49)
is the distance of a point on the ﬂux line measured from the static point P, i.e.,
the rotation radius (see Fig. 6.16). Thus, the obtained solution of (6.45) supports the
expectation that the rotational motion of ﬂux lines really takes place. The fact that this
solution satisﬁes the continuity equation for ﬂux lines is easily proved (see Appendix
A.15). This rotational motion of ﬂux lines is caused by the force-free torque. If the
ﬂux pinning effect is disregarded for simplicity, the solution of v in the region of

In this region the rotation of ﬂux lines does not occur, and (4.41) holds for the

are interested in it, the derivation of the solution is recommended.
Here we derive the induced electric ﬁeld in the area 0 ≤y < θ0/αf. From (2.49)

(6.52)
This result shows that the electric ﬁeld takes on a uniform value on the x-z plane,
whereas the rotational motion occurs on it. Thus, it can be shown that Josephson’s
formula does not hold; the electric ﬁeld obeys (6.1) [18]. It should be noted that the
electric ﬁeld is always an induced one, and the scalar function φ is not an electrostatic
potential. In particular, the dissipated power density is given by
P = E · J = −J · ∇φ
(6.53)
and the term B×v does not contribute to the energy dissipation. Thus, the term −∇φ
is more important.
It has been clariﬁed that the axial magnetic ﬂux lines inside the superconductor
must also rotate when the current is applied, as discussed in Sect. 6.1. This can also
be shown as follows: The increase in the magnetic ﬂux density on the surface due
to the self-ﬁeld HI of an applied current in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld of He is
b0 = μ0H 2
I /2He. When HI is small, this value is very small, and the penetration
depth of new ﬂux lines is very small. On the other hand, the penetration depth of the
force-free structure, i.e., that of the rotational motion of ﬂux lines, is proportional to
HI and is much deeper than the estimated penetration depth of new ﬂux lines. This
supports the above speculation. Such a rotation of inner ﬂux lines is considered to be
caused by the interaction with new tilted ﬂux lines to reduce the angular difference
between them.
This result shows that the motion of ﬂux lines in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
is not similar to that in mechanics, since it is different from the situation in the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld, as mentioned in Sect. 6.1. Thus, the idea that the observed
phenomenacannotbeexplainedwithoutassumingtheﬂuxcuttingeventisnotcorrect.
In particular, it can be shown from (6.52) that the angle of the induced electric ﬁeld
on the surface is
Ex(0)
Ez(0) = −1 −cosθ0
sinθ0
= −tanθ0
2 ,
(6.54)
even when the force-free area reaches the center (θ0 = αfd). Usually θ0 ≪
1(HI ≪He), and the electric ﬁeld is directed almost parallel to the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld, as observed in experiments. All the mistakes start from the attempt to
understand the electromagnetic phenomena in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld simi-
larly to the phenomena in dynamics, which was successful for those in the transverse
magnetic ﬁeld. On the other hand, the continuity equation for ﬂux lines is consis-
tent with Maxwell’s equations, and its solution shows the rotation of ﬂux lines. The
essential point is that we should correctly understand the matter that such an equation
describes. In comparison, meaningless biased intuition leads us on a wrong path that
hides the truth.

138

Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
Finally, we discuss the phenomena in the resistive state. In the transverse magnetic
ﬁeld, the Lorentz force exceeds the pinning force, and ﬂux ﬂow occurs. By analogy,
it is speculated that ﬂux lines become unstable under a force-free torque that exceeds
the pinning torque. The expected motion of ﬂux lines in this case is rotation driven
by the excess force-free torque. In this section an example of such a rotation was
shown in the quasi-static condition. This is the rotation illustrated in Fig. 6.11. In
the usual resistive state, however, if only such a rotation occurs, the steady condition
does not hold. To keep the steady state, when the ﬂux lines in the former plane rotate
as shown by the arrows, those must move to the next plane, i.e., to the place of the
ﬂux lines of the adjacent plane in the former instance. The steady state can be kept
under the rotational motion accompanied by such a translational motion. Since the
Lorentz force on the ﬂux lines is zero, no energy dissipation occurs due to the induced
translational motion.
We try to realize such a motion in a cylindrical superconductor. The expected
ﬂux motion is illustrated in Fig. 6.17 [19]. The movement of a ﬂux line that passes
through the center is shown in (a), and the direction of the motion at each position
along the length of the superconductor is shown in (b). This ﬂux ﬂow is called helical
ﬂux ﬂow. This ﬂux motion can be simply realized: we have only to twist the structure
of ﬂux lines that move along one direction with a constant velocity v2, as shown in
Fig. 6.18. The induced electric ﬁeld is given by (6.1). Here we discuss each term in
this equation. Since B and v are known based on the motion illustrated in Fig. 6.17, we
can directly calculate the ﬁrst term, B × v. Here we measure the potential difference
between two points “a” and “b” on the surface of the cylindrical superconductor
shown in Fig. 6.19. It is assumed that these two points are on a ﬂux line that stays
on the surface at some instant, and the distance between them is just the pitch of the

helical form. The potential difference is given by a curvilinear integral of the electric
ﬁeld and is independent of the integral path C. Hence, the same potential difference
results either from the integral path C along the ﬂux line or from the straight integral
path C′. Here we note that (B × v) · ds = (ds × B) · v. Since ds is parallel to B on
the integral path C, the curvilinear integral along it is zero. As a result, we have

C′
(B × v) · ds = 0.
(6.55)
Hence, the term B × v does not contribute to the potential difference between two
points separated by a sufﬁciently longer distance than the helical pitch. The loss
component is contained again in the second term in (6.1), similarly to the case of
the non-steady state. Hence, the second term −∇φ can be estimated from the work
done by the force-free torque in a unit time:
P = dθ0
dt .
(6.56)
Although the details of the analysis are omitted, the electric potential at z
(longitudinal position) and ϕ (azimuthal angle) on the surface is given by [19]

(6.57)
where θR is the angle of the magnetic ﬁeld on the surface measured from the z-axis.
The second term is the contribution from B × v. The observed electric potential at
three positions along the length of a Pb–Tl cylindrical superconductor [5] and the
corresponding prediction of (6.57) are shown in Fig. 6.20a and b, respectively. The
qualitative agreement is good, and it supports the helical ﬂux ﬂow. In particular,
it is found that the electric ﬁeld is negative around the area where the variation
in the electric potential along the length of the sample is reversed. In this area the
velocity of ﬂux lines is directed outward from the superconductor, and the term B×v
gives a negative longitudinal component for helical ﬂux lines (see Fig. 6.21). It was
shown in another experiment that Poynting’s vector is directed outward from the
superconductor where the electric ﬁeld is negative, directly indicating that ﬂux lines
ﬂow out of the superconductor there [20]. Thus, the negative electric ﬁeld comes
from the unimportant term B × v, and it does not mean a nucleation of energy. The
current ﬂows helically along ﬂux lines and it should be noted that i · E > 0.
Another characteristic point of the helical ﬂux ﬂow is the appearance of a radial
electric ﬁeld from the second term of (6.57). On the medium line of the theoretical
prediction in Fig. 6.20b, it can be found that the maximum transverse electric ﬁeld,

i.e., the radial electric ﬁeld, occurs along the direction from ϕ = π/2 to ϕ = 3π/2.

nent along the direction from ϕ = 0 to ϕ = π. This is consistent with the appearance
of the longitudinal negative electric ﬁeld at around ϕ = π. Such a radial electric ﬁeld
was really observed [21], and this observation gives a proof of the helical ﬂux ﬂow.

Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
Finally, we discuss the velocity component v2 in (6.57). The ﬁrst term that contains
v2 is transformed to ρff(J −Jc)z. The resistivity ρff in this case has been experimen-
tally conﬁrmed to be same as the value ρf in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld [20]. Thus,
v2 can be estimated with this relationship.
6.5
Completion of Theory
It can be said that the framework of this theory of electromagnetic phenomena in the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is almost complete except for two points. One of them is
the problem of Josephson’s theory [7], which predicts that the force-free state is stable
without stabilization by ﬂux pinning interactions. The other is that the pinning force
does not appear in the force-balance equation resulting in the force-free condition,
as shown by (6.2), whereas the ﬂux pinning strength plays an important role in the
determination of the critical current density.
Here, we discuss the ﬁrst point. Josephson assumed that the work done by the
external power source is equal to the variation in the inner free energy in the equi-
librium state in a pin-free superconductor. We assume that the magnetic ﬂux density
and current density in the superconductor are B and J, respectively. This situation is
described as
−

V
J · δAdV = 0,
(6.58)
where δA is a variation in the vector potential and V represents the region occupied
by the superconductor. Josephson assumed that relation given by
δA = δu × B
(6.59)
holds by choosing a suitable gauge. In the above δu is the displacement of ﬂux lines
corresponding to the variation. If this holds, the left-hand side of (6.58) is written as
−

V
J · (δu × B)dV =

V
δu · (J × B)dV.
(6.60)
The condition given by
J × B = 0
(6.61)
is required so that (6.58) is fulﬁlled for arbitrary δu. Thus, the force-free state is
derived. This is the result of Josephson’s theory. Yet, the assumption of (6.59) is

6.5 Completion of Theory
143
a problem. Equation (4.41) is derived from its variation with respect to time. It is
proved, however, both experimentally and theoretically that (4.41) does not hold.
Here, we examine the phenomenon in the force-free state treated in Sect. 6.4.
Firstly, the x components on the both sides are compared in (6.59). The left-hand
side is
δAx = μ2
0
αfB(HIsinθ + Hecosθ)δHI
(6.62)
and the right-hand side is
δuyBz = μ2
0
B HI(d −y)cosθδHI.
(6.63)
The derivation on each side is described in Appendix A.16. Thus, the x components
on the two sides are different. Next, the y component on the left-hand side is 0, while
that on the right-side is δuzBx −δuxBz, which is not zero. In addition, this quantity is
not a constant depending on the distance r from the rotation center. Thus, it is clear
that (6.59) does not hold. The blind spot in Josephson’s theory is that the rotational
motion of ﬂux lines is not considered.
The other point is that the pinning force does not appear in the force-balance
equation, resulting in the force-free condition, even though the ﬂux pinning governs
the associated phenomena. It has been shown that the critical state in the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld is determined by the balance between the force-free torque that works
to release the distortion of ﬂux lines caused by the parallel current and the pinning
torque that works to stabilize the distortion. On the other hand, it is speculated that
the balance between the Lorentz force and the pinning force determines the state in
the region where the current ﬂow is normal to ﬂux lines. These two kinds of balance
may coexist in general.
Here, we consider the general case where ﬂux lines penetrate the superconductor
parallel to the x-z plane, which was treated in Sect. 6.4. The superconducting current
can ﬂow freely inside the superconductor, and components normal and parallel to
the ﬂux lines may co-exist. The former component produces the Lorentz force, and
the latter produces the force-free torque. The pinning force and pinning torque are
necessary to maintain the corresponding distortions in the ﬂux line structure. These
reactions originate from the common interaction energy, i.e., the pinning energy, and
hence, these cannot be independent of each other. Namely, the pinning energy must
be shared between the two reactions. Thus, the respective balances are written as

∂y = μ0δ⊥Jc⊥f ,

where Jc⊥and Jc∥are the critical current densities along the normal and parallel
directions of ﬂux lines, δ⊥and δ∥are the sign factors of the directions of the corre-
sponding currents, respectively, and f and g are the sharing factors of the pinning
energy that satisfy [22]
f 2 + g2 = 1.
(6.66)
In the case of a superconductor, the dissipated energy in irreversible processes is
much smaller than the total energy, i.e., mostly the magnetic energy. From various
examples, the pinning energy is expected to be shared under the principle of minimum
energy dissipation. The critical state model that explains electromagnetic phenomena
in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is based on the assumption that the pinning interaction
works to minimize the variation in the magnetic ﬂux distribution. As a result, the
AC loss energy density given by (5.39) takes on its minimum value by maximizing
the critical current density, and the critical state model follows this principle. The
critical current density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, Jc∥, is much larger than
that in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld, Jc⊥, and hence, it is convenient to distribute the
pinning energy not to the force-balance but to the torque-balance to reduce the energy
dissipation. In fact, the loss energy density due to alternating current is appreciably
reduced in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld (see Fig. 6.4). Thus, we have
f ∼= 0, g ∼= 1.
(6.67)
Here, we show some experimental results that support the principle of minimum
energy dissipation. Figure 6.22 shows the results of longitudinal magnetization when

only the current is applied to a cylindrical superconductor without an applied longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld, and three typical states are observed [2]. The longitudinal
magnetization appears in the resistive state, as can be seen in (a) and (b). This indi-
cates that the current does not ﬂow parallel to the cylindrical axis but ﬂows helically,
so it produces a parallel or anti-parallel magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 6.22b and a,
respectively. Although the current ﬂows on the shortest path parallel to the axis in the
non-resistive state, as described by the critical state model (f = 1), it is shown that
the current ﬂows helically along a longer path in the resistive state to reduce the loss
energy by enhancing the critical current density under the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
produced by the current. The dashed lines in the ﬁgure show the predicted magneti-
zations when the force-free state (g = 1) is established. The observed magnetization
is smaller than this prediction. This is because the current must ﬂow in the azimuthal
direction on the surface under the force-free condition, which result in bad efﬁciency
for the transport current. Thus, the current ﬂows helically. This is an intermediate
state between the transverse and longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Since
an external longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is not applied, a transition between the two
stable states is sometimes observed, as shown in Fig. 6.22c.
Another experimental result is a measurement of the critical current density
in a superconducting slab specimen when the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld He and
the current I are simultaneously increased, while keeping the angle of the surface
magnetic ﬁeld θ constant, as shown in Fig. 6.23 [23]. Hence, only the magnitude of

146
6
Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
the surface magnetic ﬁeld changes, and it may be expected that ﬂux lines are driven
by the Lorentz force as the critical state model assumes. In this case the critical state
may be reached when the surface magnetic ﬁeld matches the penetration ﬁeld and
the ﬂux lines penetrating from the two surfaces meet at the center of the slab. The
observed critical current density was much larger than that in the transverse magnetic
ﬁeld, however, and was equal to that in the usual longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. This
shows that the current is free to ﬂow along the direction that minimizes the loss
energy.
Thus, the effect of ﬂux pinning does not appear in the force-balance, whereas it
actually determines the critical state. The force-balance equation in the force-free
condition represents the characteristic feature of the longitudinal ﬁeld effects. It is not
an essential equation, however, but is a shadow like a “cast-off skin” of the pinning
effect.
As is shown above, it can be empirically demonstrated that the principle of
minimum energy dissipation is applicable to various examples of ﬂux pinning
phenomena. This principle is also deeply associated with the determination of the
ﬂux bundle size in ﬂux creep3 [24], as well as the critical state in the transverse
magnetic ﬁeld and the sharing of pinning energy in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld.
This principle is known to hold for a linear dissipation system. On the other hand,
the ﬂux pinning phenomena belong to nonlinear case. The critical state model holds,
however, in the quasi-static process accompanied by pinning loss. Hence, this prin-
ciple may be applicable to nonlinear systems so long as the energy dissipation is
small, and further discussion is desirable (see Appendix A.10).
Based on the above discussion on the remaining two points, we can say that the
theoretical framework to explain the electromagnetic phenomena in the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld is completed.

Comparison with Electromagnetic Phenomena
in the Transverse Magnetic Field
As shown in this chapter, the electromagnetic phenomena in the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld are dramatically different from those in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld.
In this section the differences between them are compared.
The explanation of each of the peculiar longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects is
listed in Table 6.1. Understanding them is essentially different from understanding
the electromagnetic phenomena in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. The existence of
the force-free torque was unknown even in traditional electromagnetism, since the
3Flux creep: The state in which ﬂux lines are captured by pinning centers is a non-equilibrium
state, and hence, it can happen that ﬂux lines are depinned by thermal agitation. This phenomenon
is ﬂux creep and is remarkable in high-temperature superconductors. A group of ﬂux lines that are
simultaneously depinned is called a ﬂux bundle. The superconducting current density determined
by ﬂux pinning interactions sometimes decreases with time due to ﬂux creep. When the effect of
the ﬂux creep is signiﬁcant, the critical current density sometimes is reduced to zero.

longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects can occur only in superconductors, as shown in
Sect. 6.2, and the ﬂux pinning effect is needed to realize the torque. This torque is the
essential factor that causes the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects. The condition to
determine the critical current density is not the force balance but the torque balance.
The fact that the theoretical background of this model was given by Josephson’s
theory for pin-free superconductors was quite unlucky, since it signiﬁcantly delayed
the solution to the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects. In practice, most pinning
energy is distributed to the torque balance, based on the principle of irreversible
thermodynamics, resulting in almost no inﬂuence of the ﬂux pinning on the force
balance. Thus, our understanding of the force-free state is completely different. The
deviation of the induced electric ﬁeld from Josephson’s formula is caused by the
rotational motion of ﬂux lines driven by the excess of the force-free torque over
the pinning torque. This understanding is supported by the solution to the rotational
motion derived from the continuity equation for ﬂux lines. On the other hand, the ﬂux
cutting model was proposed to explain the deviation from Josephson’s formula by
traditional ways of thinking. Various phenomena can be explained by the rotational
motion of ﬂux lines without such a mechanism. There seem to be many researchers
who still believe in the ﬂux cutting, and hence, the problem of the ﬂux cutting model
is discussed in Appendix A.12.
The electric structure on the superconductor surface in the resistive state is also
explained by the rotational motion of ﬂux lines driven by the force-free torque.
During the rotational motion, translational motion is induced to fulﬁll the steady
state condition, and a negative electric ﬁeld appears in the region where ﬂux lines
go out of the superconductor. The ﬂux cutting event was also assumed in this case
to make the steady longitudinal magnetization and continuous voltage compatible
with each other. The ﬂux cutting is not necessary to explain them, however, as shown
in above. In particular, the negative electric ﬁeld cannot be explained by the ﬂux
cutting.
Finally, the rotational motion of ﬂux lines was not considered in Josephson’s
theory that provided the theoretical foundation for the force-free model. This is

natural, however, since the electromagnetic phenomena arising from the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effects exceed the traditional framework of electromagnetism.
The electromagnetic phenomena in the transverse and longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds
are generally compared in Table 6.2. The distortion in the ﬂux line structure caused by
the current is the magnetic pressure distortion (gradient of density) or tilt distortion
that gives rise to the Lorentz force to release these distortions in the transverse
magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding distortion is the rotational shearing distortion and
produces the force-free torque in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. The mechanism
that determines the quasi-static stable condition in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is
the force balance. On the other hand, there are two mechanisms, i.e., the torque
balance and the force balance, in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. The pinning energy
is mostly distributed to the former balance, resulting in the force-free condition in
the latter balance. The energy dissipation is minimized under a given condition in
each magnetic ﬁeld. While the ﬂux motion in the dynamic state in the transverse
magnetic ﬁeld is a translational motion, that in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is
mainly a rotational motion with an accompanying translational motion. The latter
component is given by vy in (6.45) for currents smaller than Ic and by v2 for currents
larger than Ic. It happens that only the rotational motion occurs when the external
magnetic ﬁeld is rotated. The induced electric ﬁeld in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld
is expressed as E = B × v and that in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is in the form
of E = B × v −∇φ in both the steady and non-steady states. In the future, it will
be required to clarify the relationship between such peculiar phenomena and the
magnetic helicity.
In Sect. 5.2 the advantage of choosing B and v as independent variables in the
critical state model was proposed to analyze the electromagnetic phenomena in the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld, since the analogy to dynamics helps us to understand the
phenomena.Ontheotherhand,sincesuchananalogydoesnotholdinthelongitudinal

avoid any confusion. It is sometimes useful, however, to clarify v to ﬁnd essential
points such as the rotational motion.
In this section we treated only the simple process of applying a longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld and then applying a current, or changing the direction of the ﬁeld to
realize the phenomena arising from the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects. There are
various cases where the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is changed later, or the longitu-
dinal magnetic ﬁeld and current are simultaneously changed, etc. It is necessary to
clarify the distribution of the pinning energy to the force balance and torque balance
in each case. It is also necessary to clarify if the energy dissipation really takes on
its minimum value.
6.7
New Electromagnetism
Traditional electromagnetism was systematized by Maxwell, and its framework was
shown in Chap. 2. The fundamental principles are the Coulomb force (including
Coulomb’s law), the Lorentz force (including the Biot-Savart law), the displacement
current, and Faraday’s law for induction. The empirical Ohm’s law for the resistivity
is included to describe practical phenomena. Thus, the magnetic force is only the
Lorentz force. The quasi-static electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors in the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld can be described by replacing Ohm’s law by the relationship
between E and J in the critical state theory, which is no longer a phenomenological
model. In the resistive state, the phenomenological dynamic critical state model that
assumes the ﬂux ﬂow resistivity is used.
In the superconductor in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, another magnetic general
force, the force-free torque, appears in addition to the Lorentz force. This torque was
not known in the traditional framework of Maxwell’s theory, although the existence
of this torque is not denied by Maxwell’s theory. In practice, the force-free torque
is derived using Maxwell’s theory. This is similar to the point that the electromag-
netic phenomena in superconductors can be described by Maxwell’s theory, although
superconductivity was not discovered when Maxwell’s theory was completed. The
state in which the force-free torque appears is the state with a ﬁnite static magnetic
helicity. This state can be realized only in superconductors with the ﬂux pinning
effect. For this reason, the discovery of the force-free torque was delayed. The new
framework of Maxwell’s theory is shown in Fig. 6.24. The current ﬂow in the static
condition is determined by the critical state theory, taking into account the distribu-
tion of the pinning energy, and that in the dynamic condition is determined by the
phenomenological model extended to the resistive state.
Theforce-freetorqueappearsonlyinsuperconductorsandunderthespecialcondi-
tion of a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. This is the reason why the discovery of the
force-free torque was delayed. There is another big reason. This can be understood
from the fact that this torque is an internal torque, as can be seen in Fig. 6.11. That is,
its value is zero when averaged inside the superconductor. The ﬂux lines in the former
plane receive the torque shown by the arrows, while those in the next plane receive

model with the assumption of energy dissipation in the dynamic case
the torque in the opposite direction. When people enjoy a rope pulling game, they
may feel that the rope is pulling them. The rope does not assist both sides, however,
and the total tension is zero. The same thing happens in the case of the Lorentz force
in the magnetization process. The Lorentz force completely cancels out in the super-
conductor, as illustrated in Fig. 6.25. On the other hand, when a current is applied
to a superconductor in an external magnetic ﬁeld, the Lorentz force appears and is
directly observed.
From this analogy, we note that the torque is observed when the magnetic ﬁeld
applied to a superconductor is rotated, as illustrated in Fig. 6.26. It may be expected
thattheforce-freetorquecanbeeasilyproved,butthereisaproblem.Sincethecurrent
ﬂowing inside the superconductor is closed, the current ﬂowing in the edge region is
perpendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld, and the torque due to the Lorentz force
is surely included in the observed torque. Thus, the correct quantitative comparison
with the theoretical prediction is complicated.

The force-free torque is a new phenomenon discovered in the 20th century after the
completion of Maxwell’s theory. This discovery is similar to the theory of relativity
by Einstein in various points as follows:
(a)
Both of them are expected ideologically. That is, the relativistic theory was based
on the principle of relativity, i.e., equivalence among the different coordinate
systems moving with different velocities and the principle of the constancy of
light velocity. The force-free torque is based on the fundamental idea that, when
a distortion exists, some restoring force should work to release the distortion.
(b) Both of them are quite different from traditional concepts. The prediction of
the theory of relativity was contradictory with respect to Newtonian mechanics.
The prediction of the force-free torque was contradictory to the ﬁxed idea of
electromagnetism that the magnetic force is only the Lorentz force.
(c)
Both of them appear only under special conditions. The theory of relativity
predicts that characteristic phenomena occur only when the velocity is close to
the velocity of light or under the inﬂuence of a huge mass. The force-free torque
appears only in superconductors in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld.
(d) Both of them are indirectly proved by experiments. The theory of relativity was
proved by the elongated life-time of muons and by the refraction of light by
the strong ﬁeld of gravity. The force-free torque is proved by a comprehensive
explanation of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects.
On the other hand, these theories are different in the following points:
(e)
The difﬁculty of the required mathematics is quite different. To understand the
theory of relativity, advanced mathematics is required. In the case of the force-
free torque, mathematics on the level of undergraduate students in the scientiﬁc
faculties is sufﬁcient.

Longitudinal Magnetic Field Effect
(f)
People’s interest is completely different. When the theory of relativity appeared
at the beginning of the 20th century, people in various ﬁelds were very inter-
ested in physics. When the force-free torque was discovered at the end of the
20th century, each research ﬁeld was subdivided and deeply developed, so that
interest from another research ﬁeld was signiﬁcantly reduced. Although the
explanation of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect represented by the force-
free torque was a proposal of an essential problem in electromagnetism, there
was no research ﬁeld of electromagnetism in the existing main journals, and
the submission of a paper was possible only in the ﬁeld of superconductivity.
Thus, the opportunity to attract the attention of researchers in various ﬁelds is
quite small now. In addition, the discovery of high-temperature superconduc-
tivity in 1986 attracted great interest from people and this had a bad effect on
the research on the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effects, which were mostly done
on metallic superconductors. Even in the ﬁeld of superconductivity, most young
researchers do not know about the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect. Now, many
professional people in this ﬁeld have passed away or retired from research.
The author is a member of the last generation who experienced research on the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect. Hence, he believes that the arrangement of the
essential points of important features of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is
his task for researchers in the next generations. It is hoped that publication of this
book will be useful for the purpose. The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect may be
completely forgotten in the future, however, with the rapid development of science
and technology. It is necessary, therefore, to apply this effect in useful technologies to
prevent the effect from being forgotten. Such a duty may be required of the author. In
thenextchapter,theelectromagneticphenomenainsuperconductorsaresummarized,
and the technologies that superconductivity supports are introduced, including an
example of an application of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect.

Continuity equation for ﬂux lines
The continuity equation for ﬂux lines (5.34) describes the variation in the magnetic
ﬂux distribution with time in a superconductor, based on using the velocity v of ﬂux
lines. Josephson’s formula (4.41) can be derived under a certain condition from this
equation and from (2.49) for induction. Equation (5.34) is used for calculation of
the AC loss energy, as shown in Sect. 5.2. In addition, this equation is also used for
estimation of the displacement of ﬂux lines, analysis of the reversible ﬂux motion in
Sect. 5.3, performance of the virtual displacement, and the derivation of the Lorentz
force in Sect. 5.7. Equation (5.34) also plays an important role in the derivation of
the rotational motion of ﬂux lines in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld treated in this
chapter.
Equation (5.34) was originally derived expecting the situation where ﬂux lines
move translationally. It is worth noting, however, that this equation can describe
general ﬂux motion, including the rotation. Such an evolution in a theoretical
approach can be found in other cases. For example, the derivation of the law of

6.7 New Electromagnetism
153
motion (2.52) from the magnetic ﬂux law (2.48) for the variation in the magnetic
ﬂux with time is also one such evolution.

Concluding Remarks
Abstract In this chapter the contents from Chaps. 2–6 are brieﬂy summarized,
and the status of electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors is overviewed in
the context of the current electromagnetic theory. Superconductors also have high
potential for applications in various ﬁelds because of their characteristic features
such as non-dissipative current and non-linear quantum phenomena. We focus on
their applications in the medical, environmental, and energy ﬁelds. Finally, it should
be emphasized that various electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors, whether
reversible or irreversible, are concerned with the ﬂux pinning. The possibilities and
direction of progress of this science, which will extend over electromagnetism and
irreversible thermodynamics in the future, are discussed.
7.1
Summary
Electromagnetism is a science that describes only the electromagnetic properties of
substances without knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of solid state physics
that play dominant roles. For example, a conductor is deﬁned as a substance in which
the electric ﬁeld is zero when an external electric ﬁeld is applied, independently of
our knowledge of the free electron theory in solids. Superconductors can also be
deﬁned as a substance in which the magnetic ﬂux density is zero when an external
magnetic ﬁeld is applied. In this case there is no problem in such a deﬁnition. It
makes even the present E-B analogy more perfect. Although superconductivity was
not yet discovered when Maxwell’s theory was completed, it is included in the
comprehensive theory as if it was known. As was shown in Sect. 3.2, it can be
proved by Maxwell’s theory that the electrical resistivity of a material that shows
B = 0 must be zero. Thus, it was, in principle, possible to predict the superconductor
in the 19th century, even though it might be an imaginary substance.
The phenomenon that adds a new page to electromagnetism is the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effect. In this phenomenon the force-free state with non-zero magnetic
helicity (A · B ̸= 0) is realized. The static state with non-zero magnetic helicity
appears only in superconductors. The magnetic structure has a characteristic distor-

Concluding Remarks
to release the distortion. In fact, the force-free torque, independent of the Lorentz
force, is derived as the general driving force from the penetration of energy during the
virtual displacement to introduce the distortion. This is quite similar to the derivation
of the Lorentz force that corresponds to the distortions of the magnetic structure in
the usual transverse magnetic ﬁeld (see Appendix A.8). Since the observed critical
current density depends on the ﬂux pinning strength, similarly to that in the transverse
magnetic ﬁeld, it is considered that the minimization of the total free energy density,
including the pinning energy, is essential. Thus, it is reasonable that the equation of
torque balance to determine the critical current density is derived from ﬁrst princi-
ples. As a result, if the increase in energy by introducing the force-free distortion
cannot be stored as the pinning energy, the distorted state cannot be stabilized. The
solution of rotational motion of ﬂux lines driven by the excess of the force-free torque
over the pinning torque is derived from the continuity equation for ﬂux lines, and
the electric ﬁeld structure on the surface in the resistive state is explained. Thus, the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect, which is quite different from the electromagnetic
phenomena in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld, is generally explained. As shown above,
the essential mechanism that causes the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is the ﬂux
pinning that stabilizes the force-free distortion. It has been believed that the theory
of electromagnetism was completed in the 19th century, but a new door has been
opened now by the introduction of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect.
Zero electrical resistivity is a speciﬁc character of superconductors, and applica-
tion of this property to various devices is expected. In many cases superconductors
are used in a high transverse magnetic ﬁeld, and ﬂux lines penetrate the supercon-
ductor in the form of quantized magnetic ﬂux. The central area of each quantized
magnetic ﬂux line must be in the normal state, however, so as to prevent the super-
conducting current density from diverging due to the singularity in the phase of the
order parameter. As a result, if ﬂux lines are driven by the Lorentz force when a
current is applied to the superconductor, energy dissipation takes place, and elec-
trical resistance appears. If the ﬂux motion can be stopped by introducing defects,
we can apply a transport current without appearance of the electrical resistance.
This is the principle of ﬂux pinning and is the origin for various applications of
superconductivity.
In the static state, there is no energy dissipation caused by ﬂux pinning interac-
tions. Under varying conditions, however, energy dissipation occurs, and electro-
magnetic phenomena in the superconductor become irreversible. This irreversibility
can be explained by the critical state model, which assumes that the ﬂux pinning
interactions minimize the variation in the magnetic ﬂux distribution inside the super-
conductor. The energy dissipation in this case is of the hysteretic type, such as iron
loss, and its value does not depend on the resistivity, but rather on the critical current
density, although the mechanism of energy dissipation is the same as for copper
loss. Its dependence on the frequency in the case of alternating variation is also
different: It is proportional to the frequency, while the copper loss is proportional
to the second power of the frequency. The irreversibility and hysteretic nature of
the pinning loss can be explained by the theory of the ﬂux pinning mechanism that
assumes that there is a many body interaction between ﬂux lines and randomly

distributed pinning potentials. In particular, it should be emphasized that the irre-
versibility can be directly derived from this theory using a statistical method for the
energetic interaction, i.e., independently of the breaking of time reversal symmetry.
As a result, the irreversibility in which pinning loss becomes thermal energy is also
obtained. On the other hand, this theory also explains reversible phenomena that
are experimentally conﬁrmed, since the interaction is caused by the pinning energy.
Based on this aspect it was realized that the force-balance equation in the critical
state model could be derived by minimizing the free energy, taking account of the
work done by the Lorentz force in the pinning potential ﬁeld, and by extending it to
the irreversible case. As a result, the critical state model, i.e., a phenomenological
model, could be improved as a general theory. In the irreversible state, including the
resistive state, in which energy is dissipated, the ﬁrst principles of minimizing the
energy cannot be used. For example, this point is clear in the process from point A
to point P in Fig. 5.16. At each instance in this process, the state is, however, almost
close to the state derived from ﬁrst principles, and the associated energy dissipation
is at a minimum. Even for non-isolated systems, the state with minimum free energy
is attained in the reversible region, such as those in the process from point P to point
Q (see Appendix A.8).
Looking over a series of phenomena in superconductors, the idea that the super-
conductivity is a peculiar phenomenon may be said to be biased. No resistivity seems
to be strange. The resistivity is, however, a phenomenological property that cannot be
theoreticallyproved.Ontheotherhand,thephenomenainsuperconductors,including
the ﬂux pinning can be explained by ﬁrst principles to minimize the free energy.
That is, superconductors are pure materials in physics. In addition, superconducting
substances are not minor, since many elements or compounds show superconduc-
tivity, when conditions such as high pressure or thin ﬁlm geometry are included.
Only the transition temperature to the superconducting state is low. If room temper-
ature superconductors are found in the future, the concept that superconductors are
peculiar may fade away.
The high-temperature superconductors discovered in 1986 that showed a rapid
development in their quality are not discussed in this book. This is because the
critical current density caused by ﬂux pinning can be deﬁned, the electromagnetic
phenomena are explainable using the irreversible critical state model, and the pinning
loss has a hysteretic nature, as in metallic low temperature superconductors. That is,
the main properties are essentially the same as the description in this book, although
there are still some points that need to be considered. These are described in Appendix
A.17.

Superconductor Technology in the Future
Superconductivity has signiﬁcantly contributed to the progress in solid state physics
in the 20th century. As described in this book, superconductors are common mate-
rials and are classiﬁed as one of the fundamental magnetic materials in electromag-
netism. These are typical materials that show irreversibility in magnetic hysteresis
from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. Some new physics may also be based on
superconductors. Thus, superconductors are attractive substances.
The property of superconductors that the resistivity is zero under static conditions
is not only interesting from the viewpoint of physics, but also attractive from that of
application. The area of application that the superconductor technology using zero
resistivity can cover is widely spread over various ﬁelds, including power applica-
tions, energy saving, the environment, transportation systems, industrial technology,
medicine, etc. In addition, it extends even to the ﬁeld of electronics, using its inherent
nonlinearproperties(seeFig.7.1).Informationtechnologywasapartofelectronicsin
former times, although it deeply penetrates all ﬁelds of technology now, and research
and industry in each ﬁeld can no longer exists without it. Even an important wide
area in people’s daily life, such as telecommunications, distribution, and medical
services, is supported by information technology. Superconductor technology is also
a similar but slightly different technology that supports society, and it is expected to
support even high-level information technology.
Inthissectiontheapplicationofsuperconductortechnologyintheﬁeldsofmedical
treatment, environment, transportation, and energy will be brieﬂy introduced.
(1) Medical treatment
The application of superconductors to medical treatments is roughly classiﬁed into
two categories from the viewpoint of technology. One of them is the application of
ﬂux pinning phenomena, which is similar to other applications in the ﬁelds of energy
and environment, and the other is the application of the Josephson effect, which has
not been introduced in this book.
The most widely used type of equipment in the ﬁrst category comprises the
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems mentioned in Chap. 1. Very strong and
stable magnetic ﬁelds can be produced by superconducting magnets operated in
persistent current mode, which makes it possible to visualize clear cross-sections
of human body using the nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Open-type MRI
systems that reduce the anxiety of subjects are likely to become popular in the near
future.
Another system using superconducting magnets is heavy ion therapy for cancer
treatment. This is similar to a technique used in particle physics, where heavy ions
accelerated by a strong magnetic ﬁeld are used to directly irradiate tumor cells with
high precision. In particular, a rotating gantry can irradiate the tumor while directing
the beam from an arbitrary direction, and hence, the subject’s body can remain in a
ﬁxed position, which helps to prevent his or her internal organs from moving due to
gravity and contributes to a precise irradiation. If normal magnets are used for this

system, their size must be very large, and a huge amount of electric power is needed
for operation. If we introduce superconducting magnets, the size can be signiﬁcantly
reduced, and the operation cost can also be dramatically reduced. Figure 7.2 shows
a superconducting magnet that is to be installed in a rotating gantry system.
Drug delivery systems represent another type of application of superconductor
technology in the ﬁeld of medical treatment. First, a magnetic seeding technique
is used for the needed medicine, i.e., a small amount of ﬁne magnetic particles is
added to the medicine, and the medicine is delivered to the desired location in the
diseased part of the subject by using a strong magnetic ﬁeld from a magnetized bulk
superconductor. The treatment is carried out by keeping the medicine at the diseased
part for the desired period.

Radiological Sciences)
Another type of medical treatment is based on the Josephson effect. A
Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) composed of two
Josephson junctions1 and a superconducting loop is used. A SQUID is quite sensitive
to magnetic ﬁeld, as can be understood from (4.20), and various types of informa-
tion can be obtained from magnetic measurements. One such medical system is the
magnetic cardiograph used for examination of the heart, similarly to the usual cardio-
graph. One of the merits of the new system is that there is no need to attach electrodes
to the body for the usual cardiograph, and the examination can be conducted with the
patient in a clothed condition. The information obtained is increased signiﬁcantly,
because the magnetic ﬁeld can be measured as a vector. It is possible even to inspect
the heart of a baby in its mother. The magnetoencephalograph is a similar medical
system used for inspection of the brain by measuring very weak magnetic ﬁelds
produced by a current ﬂowing in the brain. This is used for locating diseased regions
in the brain.
The SQUID is also used for investigation of antigen-antibody interactions. It
is used to measure the rate at which antigens, which cause allergic reactions,
combine with antibodies in a subject. Antibodies mixed with magnetic nanoparti-
cles called magnetic markers are used as the reagent. First, antibodies in the reagent
are combined with antigens of the subject, and then, free antibodies are washed
away. Finally, the magnetic moment of the remaining antibodies combined with
magnetic nanoparticles is sensitively measured using a SQUID magnetometer. Thus,

tends to concentrate in a diseased region, it is also possible to diagnose the location
and degree of disease by searching for the location and the amount of magnetic
marker. Since the amount of magnetic substances that can be dosed safely is limited,
highly sensitive magnetic measurements are needed, and the SQUID magnetometer
is used.

7.2 Superconductor Technology in the Future

(2) Applications for environment
One superconductor technology that contributes to environmental issues is high-
gradient magnetic separation (HGMS). Much higher magnetic ﬁeld can be produced
by magnetized high-temperature superconducting bulks than permanent magnets in
the Nd system. The combination of this strong magnetic ﬁeld with a ﬁlter made of
a magnetic material with high permeability makes it possible to separate magnetic
particles from other materials by attracting them strongly at places where the strength
of the magnetic ﬁeld varies greatly in space. In many cases the magnetic seeding
process is employed to attach magnetic nanoparticles to the substance to be removed.
Then, the substance is removed using HGMS. Examples are found in the puriﬁca-
tion of water used for paper manufacturing, removal of harmful chemicals that cause
environmental pollution from liquids, improvement of the water quality of lakes or
ponds in which large amounts of blue-green algae grow, etc. It is also expected to be
applicable for puriﬁcation of sea water from red tides. Figure 7.3 shows the compo-
sition of a ﬁne magnetic separator, in which a high-temperature superconducting
bulk magnet is installed in a high-gradient magnetic separator for water puriﬁcation.
Water processed by magnetic-seeding comes from the left side, and substances to
be removed are attracted to the magnetic ﬁlter near the bulk magnet, so puriﬁed
water only ﬂows to the right side. This technology is also used for puriﬁcation of

Concluding Remarks
water in the ﬁeld of electric power generation. Water must be circulated for cooling
in thermal power plants. If impure substances contained in the water adhere to the
inner walls of heat exchangers, they degrade the heat exchange performance. Thus,
it is necessary to purify the water. In geothermal power generation, this technology is
also expected to prevent impurities contained in the hot spring water from adhering
to the inner walls of pipes or rotating fans, which will cause clogging or reduction
in the efﬁciency, respectively.
(3) Transportation
One of applications for transportation systems is the superconducting magnetic levi-
tated (SCMAGLEV) train. It is planned that these trains will run between Tokyo
and Nagoya, and the line will be extended to Osaka in the future. Superconducting
magnets in the train are operated in the persistent current mode, and the train is
levitated by the repulsive interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the
superconducting magnets and the magnetic ﬁeld that is induced in closed coils or
conducting plates arranged on the ground when the train gets close. Acceleration
or deacceleration is done by controlling the current applied to the driving coils that
produce attractive or repulsive forces. Since the levitation is realized by using repul-
sive forces, the train does not touch the walls due to the strong repulsive force, even
when there is a big earthquake. The operating speed of the trains will be 500 km/h.
This is limited to prevent the power efﬁciency from being reduced by air resistance
and to keep the noise level low when the train goes into or out of a tunnel. In principle,
however, there is no limit to the speed. It would be possible to increase the speed
even up to 3500 km/h, if the train runs in an evacuated tube.
Ships usually move by means of engine that directly rotate their screws, which are
placed at the stern. Mostly, ships do not sail at the maximum speed but with about
half that value. In this case, the efﬁciency of the engine is not high. It is better to drive
the screw with an electric motor to improve the efﬁciency. Then, an electric generator
is necessary to drive the motor. It seems to be inefﬁcient to generate electricity and
rotate the screw using generated electric power instead of the direct drive by the
engine. The efﬁciency mostly increases, however, since the efﬁciencies of electric
generators and motors are high. An additional merit of this system is the increase in
the efﬁciency brought about by a smart shape for the stern, which reduces the water
resistance, since the engine can be replaced by a small, powerful electric motor. In
addition, the generator can be placed in a free space in the ship, and this may give the
ship a structure of high utility. It is possible to install a superconducting generator
and motor to further increase the efﬁciency. This is expected for large ships and also
contributes to a reduction in CO2 emission.
The aerospace industry intends to reduce the amount of its CO2 emissions around
the world in 2050 to the half of the present amount as a measure against global
warming. On the other hand, the need for air ﬂights is estimated to be doubled.
Hence, we have to develop a new technology to reduce the CO2 emissions to one
quarter in the present stage. Electriﬁcation is inevitable for the propulsion system,
and the superconductor technology is expected to play a role in this achievement.

7.2 Superconductor Technology in the Future
163
The principle is the same as that for the ship propulsion, and the superconducting
generator and motor will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. In this case an
effective and environmentally friendly system, in which the liquid hydrogen used for
cooling superconducting devices is used as fuel for superconducting generators, will
be examined. Various types of aircraft are now being designed, and it is imagined
that aircraft with much different shapes will ﬂy in the sky around the world in the
future.
(4) Applications for energy problems
Recently, the global warming of the earth by CO2 has been recognized as a serious
problem. On the other hand, although nuclear electricity generation does not emit
CO2, people are quite sensitive to radioactive contamination caused by an accident
at a nuclear electric power plant after the Great East Japan Earthquake. In addition,
uncertainty about the safety of radioactive waste that has to be managed for over a
long period of time that human beings have never experienced makes people anxious.
Hence, nuclear electricity generation will diminish without public support. Thus, the
use of renewable energy that does not emit CO2 will advance. Solar power generation,
the cost of which is expected to be dramatically reduced, is particularly promising.
The problems in progressing the use of renewable energy are the installation of
power transmission cables to the regions in which the electric power is used and
devices to store the excess electrical energy. In particular, the energy storage devices
that can store energy instantaneously are quite expensive now. This prevents local
governments that intend to consume generated energy from ever starting solar power
generation. If we look at Europe, they solve this problem by delivering excess energy
to regions of power shortage instead of storing energy. Electric power may not be
generated because there is no wind in some regions, while excess electric power is
generated by strong wind in other regions. It is important to send excess electrical
energy to regions of shortage over a wide area, which averages the demand for
electrical energy. A similar situation occurs for solar power generation when it is
diminished by cloud. This is the same principle as the improvement of signal to
noise ratio by overlapping small signals buried in noise many times. If the area
connected with the power line becomes wider, averaging becomes more effective.
This reduces the necessity for installing expensive energy storage systems. In this
case, the cost of the power line is an important factor.
When the power line becomes long, superconducting power transmission with
small energy dissipation is advantageous. Direct current (DC) is advisable instead
of alternating current (AC) for the power transmission. This is because the solar
power generation is DC. DC electric power transmission is also better for wind
power generation. Although the power generation takes place under AC conditions,
the frequency and phase of the induced voltage are random among many genera-
tors. DC power transmission is also beneﬁcial from the viewpoint of superconductor
technology; there is no AC loss in the superconductor, and the structure of the super-
conducting cable becomes simple. In addition, the demand for DC electricity in
society is larger than that for AC electricity. In modern homes, most of the electrical

164
7
Concluding Remarks
appliances, such as televisions, are driven by DC electricity. In the case of refrigera-
tors, washing machines, and air conditioners, commercial AC electricity is converted
to high-frequency AC via DC. Hence, if DC electricity could be supplied to each
home, the conversion from commercial AC to DC would not be necessary.
For superconducting power transmission, we need to cool the superconducting
cable to a sufﬁciently low temperature such as liquid nitrogen temperature (77.3 K).
The heat that invades the transmission line from the surface is about 1 W per unit
length, and we need electric power of 15 W/m to remove this heat power from
the region at 77.3 K. If this power is smaller than the electric power consumed
in the usual copper transmission line, the superconducting power transmission is
advantageous from the viewpoint of operation cost. If we assume an electric power
transmission of 3 kA through a copper cable, the cross-sectional area of the copper
wire is 3,000 mm2, and the electrical resistance per unit length at room temperature
is 5.7 µ, which results in electric power consumption of 51 W/m. Hence, even if
we take the rate of operation into account, the superconducting power transmission
is economical. When the current is increased, the advantage of introducing super-
conducting power transmission increases, since the cost for cooling does not change.
We now have the problem of the fabrication cost of superconducting cable. This
will be solved, however, by reduction of the cost of superconducting tapes through
improvement of the fabrication technology, with mass production based on the neces-
sity of introducing superconductivity to reduce CO2 emissions. The fairly high cost
of copper brought about by global economic growth also supports the introduction
of superconductivity. The above comparison has been made for the case where the
power transmission voltage is kept the same as for the present system. If we increase
the current, which increases the advantage of superconductivity, we can reduce the
voltage. This is another advantageous point.
When a network of power transmission lines over a wide area is constructed,
large fault currents caused by short circuits may happen. It is necessary to prevent
such fault currents from propagating. The fault current limiter is the instrument used
for this purpose, and application of superconductors is also expected. There are two
types of superconducting fault current limiter, the resistive type and the magnetic
shield type. The large impedance when the superconductor goes into the normal
state is used to reduce the fault current for both types. The large electrical resistance
in the normal state is directly used in the former type. In the latter type, a transformer
is designed so that the magnetic ﬂux in its iron core produced by the primary and
secondary windings is usually cancelled. When the transport current exceeds the
critical value in one winding, the resistance that appears in this winding reduces the
current, and magnetic ﬂux appears in the iron core, resulting in dramatic increase in
the inductance. Thus, the magnetic shield type is used only for alternating currents,
but the resistive type is used for direct and alternating currents. Rare earth barium
copper oxide (REBCO) thin ﬁlms are used for the resistive fault current limiter.
Since high resistance is needed when the superconducting thin ﬁlms go into the
normal state, the use of copper for protection of the thin ﬁlms is limited, and the
possibility that the limiter will be damaged is fairly high. On the other hand, since
the superconducting cable is very long, it is fairly easy to obtain high resistance. For

7.2 Superconductor Technology in the Future
165
this reason, research on superconducting cable with a fault-current limiting function
has been carried out in the USA, and such a long cable was practically fabricated in
Korea recently.
The author has proposed a high-performance DC superconducting power cable in
which the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect described in Chap. 6 is applied [1]. The
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect was discovered more than 50 years ago. Although it
is a fantastic phenomenon from the viewpoint of technology that the critical current
density increases, no application of this effect has been proposed. It is especially
strange that this effect has not been applied in superconducting power cables, where
it offers the direct beneﬁt of an increase in the critical current density. The essential
point is to apply a magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the cable itself, and hence, the super-
conducting tapes in the outer shielding conductor are wound in one direction so
that the return current ﬂowing in this conductor produces a longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld. Then, the superconducting tapes in the inner conductor are wound so that the
force-free structure is achieved (see Fig. 7.4). The magnetic ﬁeld is almost directed
parallel to the cable axis on the innermost layer and its angle tends to increase on the
outer layers. Thus, the winding angle of the superconducting tapes is monotonically
increased for the outer layers. Although a detailed analysis is needed to design an
optimal structure, the principle is very simple. It may be anticipated that an appre-
ciable effect will not be obtained, since the resultant longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is not
very strong. A relatively strong longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld can be achieved, however,
since a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is also produced by the inner conductor. Only

ﬂat tapes can be fabricated from high-temperature superconductors, and these are
considered to be disadvantageous in comparison with round wires made of metallic
superconductors. This is true as a material for superconducting magnets, but tape
superconductors are more advantageous to achieve the force-free structure in the
cable. Hence, high-temperature superconductors are suitable for superconducting
cables. Since the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect becomes more prominent under
a stronger magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Figs. 6.2 and 6.8, this structure is more effec-
tive for power transmission of larger currents. When the number of superconducting
layers is increased, the current-carrying capacity increases monotonically for both
the usual and the new longitudinal-ﬁeld cables. But the enhancement of the current-
carrying capacity is stronger for the longitudinal-ﬁeld cable, as shown in Fig. 7.5.
This simply results from the difference in the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the crit-
ical current density between the transverse and longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds (see
Fig. 6.8a).
It was mentioned that the introduction of fault current limiters is necessary to
achieve an electric power network using superconducting DC power cable over a
wide area to promote the use of renewable energy. It is possible to add a fault-current
limiting function to the superconducting cable, and such a trial has been carried out
in the USA and Korea, as mentioned above. The principle is the same as for the
longitudinal-ﬁeld cable. In the usual superconducting cable, the resistive transition
of superconductors is simply used. On the other hand, the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
effect used for the enhancement of the critical current density is effectively used also
for the limiting of fault current in the longitudinal-ﬁeld cable. That is, the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld used to increase the critical current density in normal operation is
designed to be decreased when a large fault current starts to ﬂow. The resultant
decrease in the critical current density accelerates the resistive transition, and the
fault current limiting function is strengthened. The structure of superconducting
cable with fault current limiting function is shown in Fig. 7.6 [2]. The copper wires
for stabilization is twisted in the opposite direction to the superconducting tapes in

A critical current density that increases with increasing longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 6.8a, has been obtained for short samples of REBCO tapes.
Its value for long commercial REBCO tapes is, however, almost ﬂat or slightly
decreasing with increasing longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. Hence, the improvement of
the current-carrying capacity of a new-type cable is not so dramatic, as shown in
Fig. 7.5, although it is appreciably higher than that in the usual cables [3]. This is
probably caused by defects that disturb uniform current transportation in commercial
tapes. Improvement of the current-carrying property of commercial tapes, which will
realize a dramatic improvement in the cable performance, is expected in the future.
Superconducting instruments, such as generators, transformers, magnetic energy
storage devices, fault current limiters, etc., that compose the electric power grid with
generation using renewable energy are being developed now. Especially for the case
of high power generation using wind turbines, reduction in size of generators is
strongly required, and the application of superconducting generators is expected.

7.3
Scientiﬁc Signiﬁcance of Flux Pinning Phenomena
Even under applied current, energy dissipation does not occur in a superconductor, if
ﬂux lines are not driven to move. The loss due to the motion of ﬂux lines is not of the
copper-loss type similar to that in a usual current-carrying resistive material, but is
a hysteresis loss of the iron-loss type. The details of this mechanism were explained
in Chap. 5. The hysteresis loss is caused by the large velocity of ﬂux lines when they
fall into or jump out of the pinning potential well.
In other ﬁelds than ﬂux pinning in superconductors, similar phenomena are found
in the motion of magnetic domain walls2 in ferromagnetic materials or in friction
in mechanical systems. In particular, it is well known that a magnetic domain wall
captured by a crystalline defect moves suddenly to a stable position when it is driven
by a magnetic force. This is quite similar to the motion of a depinned ﬂux line in
a superconductor. The friction is speculated to be caused by Coulomb interaction
between the unevenness of the adjacent frictional surfaces of the material and the
ﬂoor, if we neglect complicated cases with microscopic destruction, and the oscil-
lation of local parts driven by the added force causes the loss. Figure 7.7 shows
the dependence of the frictional force on the macroscopic velocity of a material,
and the dynamic frictional force is generally weaker than the static frictional force.
Since a driven material moves suddenly for this reason, the frictional force cannot be
measured in the region of low velocity. It is possible to reduce the velocity after the
material has started to move. If the material moving on the ﬂoor is perfectly rigid,
2Magnetic domain wall: A region in which the magnetization is aligned parallel is called a magnetic
domain in a ferromagnetic material and a ferromagnetic single crystal on a macroscopic scale
is usually composed of many magnetic domains with magnetization in various directions. The
boundary between two adjacent magnetic domains is the magnetic domain wall. Its thickness is
about 50 nm for iron. The direction of the magnetization changes gradually along the direction
across the wall. When the magnetic ﬁeld is changed within a relatively weak range, the change in
the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material is caused by displacement of magnetic domain walls.

7.3 Scientiﬁc Signiﬁcance of Flux Pinning Phenomena
169
the dynamic frictional force caused by its motion in the potential ﬁeld is expected to
approach zero asymptotically, as shown by the chained line in Fig. 7.7.3 In practice,
energy dissipation occurs due to the elastic damped oscillations of the projections on
each rough surface. These two factors result in the dynamic frictional force, which
diminishes but approaches a ﬁnite value, as illustrated in Fig. 7.7. In the case of ﬂux
pinning in a superconductor, the ﬂux line lattice behaves elastically, and the resultant
dynamic pinning force is similar to the static pinning force. This is assumed to be
the same in the dynamic critical state model.
The common point in these phenomena is random interactions between a moving
body and the matter that restricts the motion, which can be described as a potential.
These interactions are reversible when the displacement of a ﬂux line, magnetic
domainwall,orbodyissmallenough.Inparticular,suchreversiblephenomenacanbe
measured when a variation in magnetization is observed due to a small AC magnetic
ﬁeld on a major magnetization curve. The play of a body when it is displaced slightly
by a force corresponds to this in a mechanical system. The reversibility shows that
such interactions are caused by potential, and this is the essence of those phenomena
that show hysteresis under large displacements.
In the case of electromagnetic phenomena in a superconductor, the irreversibility
was proved by the summation theory of ﬂux pinning. The irreversibility does not
come from the breaking of time reversal symmetry of the equation of motion but
from the change in the force balance equation before and after the change in the
direction of motion due to unstable ﬂux motion. The unstable ﬂux motion is also
responsible for the hysteresis loss through the mechanism of viscous loss. A similar
theoretical system can be constructed for the motion of magnetic domain walls in
ferromagnetic materials or for friction in mechanical systems. The irreversibility in
these systems is also derived from the change in the governing equation due to the
instability. Hence, this kind of theory can be generalized to describe irreversibility
of this nature, although some correction is necessary. In the case of the motion of
magnetic domain walls, the spacing between magnetic domain walls is wide, and
there is no periodicity among them, so a model of isolated pinning centers seems to
be adequate instead of the periodic pinning model used in this book. It seems to be
necessary to assume irregular pinning centers with high density for friction.
The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect was introduced as a new electromagnetic
phenomenon in this book. The force-free state that appears in the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effect is a special state with ﬁnite magnetic helicity in the static state,
and hence, it can be achieved only in superconductors. The current and magnetic
ﬂux lines are locally parallel to each other, and the resultant Lorentz force is zero
in this state. There is a characteristic torsion, however, i.e., a rotational shearing
torsion, in the ﬂux line system in this state, and a torque works on ﬂux lines to reduce
the torsion. This is the force-free torque. The pinning energy is shared between
the force-balance and the torque balance. The ﬂux line system is self-organized to

Concluding Remarks
minimize the energy dissipation, and most pinning energy is allotted for the torque
balance. This explains why the pinning force does not appear in the force balance,
resulting in the force-free state, whereas the critical current density is determined
by the ﬂux pinning strength. All the electromagnetic phenomena of the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effect, including the negative electric ﬁeld, can be generally explained
by the rotational ﬂux motion driven by the force-free torque. The magnetic helicity
is retained, even in the situation of rotational ﬂux motion. It is interesting to compare
the behavior of ﬂux lines in the superconductor in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld with
that of ﬂux lines in a plasma that also has magnetic helicity. The electromagnetic
phenomena in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld are essentially different from those
in the superconductor in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic helicity in the
latter case is zero. Although the force-free torque appears only in the superconductor
in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, it surely adds a new page to Maxwell’s theory.
In addition, the characteristic force-free state appears only under the inﬂuence
of ﬂux pinning. In other words, the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is an effect in
which the ﬂux pinning plays a dominant role and it is essentially irreversible. The
ﬂux pinning effect has attracted attention in vortex physics as one of the factors that
determine the phase of the ﬂux line system. This is the ﬁrst case where the ﬂux
pinning effect is dominant in the ﬁeld of fundamental science.
The electromagnetic phenomena in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld are described
by the phenomenological critical state model. It was shown that the assumption in
this model that the pinning force makes the maximum effort to prevent a variation
in the magnetic ﬂux distribution does not contradict the principle of irreversible
thermodynamics of minimum energy dissipation. There are two kinds of balance in
determining the current direction with two degrees of freedom under a longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld, and it was shown again that the pinning energy is distributed so as
to minimize the energy dissipation, as assumed in the principle. It is an important
topic to prove theoretically that this principle holds generally, even in a nonlinear
dissipation system, as discussed in Appendix A.10. Detailed analyses of various
electromagnetic phenomena in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld are not sufﬁcient as
yet, and research by many scientists is needed in the future. Thus, the physics of the
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect is a new science, in which electromagnetism and
irreversible thermodynamics merge together. Efforts to deepen this ﬁeld are expected.

Poynting’s vector
One of most useful concepts besides the continuity equation of ﬂux lines in this
book is Poynting’s vector. The energy that penetrates the superconductor while the
external magnetic ﬁeld is changing can be estimated using Poynting’s vector. As
shown in this book, the variation in the internal magnetic energy is different from
this energy, indicating the possibility of the appearance or disappearance of energy.
This is the work done by the driving force. The force-free torque in the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effect is also derived using Poynting’s vector.

7.3 Scientiﬁc Signiﬁcance of Flux Pinning Phenomena

Fig. 7.8 Poynting’s vector produced by electric and magnetic ﬁelds applied in the space between
two parallel plate conductors
Although Poynting’s vector is quite useful, as mentioned above, there is a case
where we have to carefully understand the meaning of this quantity. We assume that
voltage V is applied between two parallel long plate conductors separated by distance
d. A magnetic ﬁeld H is applied in the space between the two plates in the direction
normal to the sheet using a permanent magnet, as shown in Fig. 7.8. Poynting’s vector
in the space is SP = VH/d and directed horizontally. This suggests an energetic ﬂow
in this situation, although no electric power is supplied by the source. How can we
understand this?
Equation (2.61) holds. This result does not change, however, when Poynting’s
vector SP is replaced by SP + ∇× K. That is, there is a difference by an amount of
the curl of an arbitrary vector K between Poynting’s vector and the true energy ﬂow
[4]. Hence, it is necessary to check if Poynting’s vector represents the true energy
ﬂow in each case. This is analogous to the arbitrariness when we derive the electric
ﬁeld from Maxwell’s (2.49) and the continuity equation of ﬂux lines (5.34). It does
not result necessarily in (4.41) but in (6.1) in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. It is
not possible to prove this theoretically, but we have to judge by comparing with
experimental results.

Afterword
In electromagnetism, the fundamental electromagnetic properties of substances are
only described based on simple rules, without regards to the detailed mechanisms
in each substance. It is astonishing, however, that this principle holds over a wide
range, from the quantum scale to the astronomical scale. In addition, it won the
argument against mechanics, which had been believed to be perfectly rigorous for
hundreds of years, and opened the way to the principle of relativity. As shown in
this book, the superconductor, which had not yet been discovered when Maxwell’s
theory was completed, has its own position in the present theory of electromagnetism,
based on the E-B analogy. The fact that zero electrical resistivity in diamagnetic
superconductors can be derived by Maxwell’s theory itself represents the profound
rigor of this theory. In other words, the superconductor could have been predicted in
the 19th century. This means that superconductors are not special, but one type of
the common materials. In fact, many kinds of materials show superconductivity.
The electromagnetic phenomena associated with ﬂux pinning in the supercon-
ductor, especially irreversibility and the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect, have been
explained in this book. The physical properties of superconductors have attracted
attention, and clariﬁcation of the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity
in cuprates and further searching for room temperature superconductors are expected
in the future. On the other hand, if we look at the electromagnetic phenomena in the
superconductor,wecanalsoﬁndinterestingsubjectsassociatedwithirreversiblether-
modynamics and classic electromagnetism, as shown in this book. Further scientiﬁc
development in these ﬁelds is expected in the future. For this reason, enrichment of
the education of young scientists on primary electromagnetism is desirable as a ﬁrst
step.
The contents in this book are based on the research and education conducted by the
author. Looking back at these, the sequence is not simple. The author started the study
of applied superconductivity in 1969 for his graduate thesis in the group of Profs.
Irie and Yamafuji of the Department of Electronics in the Faculty of Engineering in
Kyushu University. This is the year in which the human being reached the moon.

Afterword
This group was the ﬁrst group worldwide to complete the theoretical framework
of electromagnetic phenomena based on the critical state model and investigate the
ﬂux pinning mechanism in 1967. In addition, they designed the superconducting
magnetic energy storage (SMES) system and classiﬁed such systems based on their
stored energy and power in the early 1970s. In such a situation, his research was
naturally directed to the electromagnetic properties and ﬂux pinning phenomena
relevant to applied superconductivity. Thus, the author received a doctoral degree for
his research on the ﬂux pinning mechanism.
In the course of the research in this group, the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect
was investigated by other scientists, and the author was attracted to this peculiar
phenomenon. The ﬁrst analysis by the author on this effect was on the ﬂux invasion
into a superconducting cylinder, as shown in Appendix A.10. The author recog-
nized the fundamental points on this effect, and then, he read many associated
papers. Finally, he found that the misunderstanding of this effect in the 1970s was
essentially based on a wrong interpretation of the theory by Josephson on general
electromagnetic features. Then, each problem was solved step by step.
High temperature superconductivity was discovered in 1986. Soon after, almost
all of the research on superconductivity was concentrated on the new materials. The
author moved from Kyushu University to Kyushu Institute of Technology in 1990.
Although the research on ﬂux pinning phenomena and the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
effect in metallic superconductors was still interesting, the author also mainly investi-
gated the electromagnetic phenomena, especially the ﬂux creep, of high temperature
superconductors and established the theory of collective ﬂux creep and ﬂow. In this
theory the ﬂux bundle size is assumed to be determined by the principle of minimum
energy dissipation. This was based on his experience in studying the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effect.
In the meantime, the author was asked to publish “Flux Pinning and Electro-
magnetic Phenomena in Superconductors” by Sangyo Tosho Co. in Japan. Then,
the coherent potential approximation theory on the ﬂux pinning mechanism was
completed, since it was the main point in this book. Thus, the threshold problem in
the summation theory that had been argued for a long time was solved. The compli-
cated theory of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect was also arranged in order for
easy understanding.
The author was occasionally occupied by the administrative work of Kyushu
Institute of Technology from the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st
century, so it was quite difﬁcult to continue research in this period. There was a time
to think over the difﬁcult problem, however, of spreading the acquired knowledge
on the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect to scientists around the world. Unfortu-
nately, the electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors are familiar to only a
small fraction of scientists, and almost no scientists in other ﬁelds will know about
the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect. In addition, whereas this is a fundamental effect
of electromagnetism, the section on electromagnetism has disappeared from the main
journals on physics. Thus, there is no way to directly send a message to scientists
around the world. The author then felt the necessity to familiarize young people
with superconductivity. Fortunately, the author had taught the fundamental magnetic

properties of superconductors in lectures on electromagnetism and decided to publish
a textbook in which superconductivity was introduced. This was quite successful,
especially in terms of strengthening the present E-B analogy in electromagnetism.
When the administrative work was over, the author engaged in writing this textbook.
The textbook was then published, and the English edition entitled “Flux Pinning in
Superconductors” was also published.
Later, the author published the main points of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
effect through a newspaper. A newspaper reporter asked about the possibility of
application of this effect. The author answered that the superconducting power cable
would be a candidate. Several days later, an ofﬁcer of the incubation center of the
Institute asked the author about the possibility of this application, followed by a
practical investigation of the new superconducting power cable. The principle of
the cable is explained in Chap. 7. It was quite lucky for the author, who studied in
the group of Profs. Irie and Yamafuji, to be engaged in a practical application of
superconductivity.
Just before his retirement from Kyushu Institute of Technology, the author felt
that it was necessary to unify the theories of ﬂux pinning by Prof. Fujio Irie and Prof.
Kaoru Yamafuji into a comprehensive structure. The ﬂux pinning theory of Prof.
Yamafuji was already proved many years ago, including the threshold problem by
using the statistical method. Then, the critical state model was derived theoretically
using ﬁrst principles. Although each ﬂux pinning theory was separately proved, the
statistical summation theory and the critical state theory were still not yet uniﬁed.
Then, the pinning loss power density was calculated, using the time average equiva-
lent to the statistical average in the former theory, and it was shown that the obtained
relationship between the pinning loss power density and the pinning force density
was the same as that assumed in the critical state model. Thus, the theories published
in 1967 by two professors ([3] and [13] in Chap. 5) could be completely uniﬁed, and
the author could repay them.

Derivation of Ginzburg-Landau Equations
The equilibrium state in a superconductor is given by the condition in which the
volume integral of the free energy density Fs in (4.2) takes on a minimum value with
respect to the order parameter  and the vector potential A.
It is assumed that  changes by a small amount δ. (∗also changes by δ∗.)
This leads to the variation in the total free energy:

be satisﬁed:

On substituting (A.1.7) into (A.1.2), it is found that the following condition should
be fulﬁlled so that the surface integral of this equation is zero:
n · (−iℏ∇+ 2eA) = 0,
(A.1.8)
where n is a unit vector normal to the surface of the superconductor. The meaning
of this condition will be explained later.
Next, it is assumed that the vector potential A changes by a small amount δA.
This leads to a variation in the total free energy:

(A.1.12)
Hence, the condition of (A.1.8) is that the current does not ﬂow across the
superconductor, i.e., n · i = 0.
So that the surface integral of (A.1.10) is zero, the following condition should be
fulﬁlled:
[δA × (∇× A)] · n = 0.
(A.1.13)
Under the condition of the usual transverse magnetic ﬁeld, (4.41) for the induced
electric ﬁeld holds. In this case, if the displacement of ﬂux lines that causes δA is
denoted by δu, we have the relationship δA = δu × B. (Note that its time derivative
leads to (4.41).) Hence, the content in the brackets in (A.1.13) is written as
(δu × B) × B = (B · δu)B −B2δu.
(A.1.14)
Since the displacement of ﬂux lines along their length is meaningless, the displace-
ment is deﬁned so that it is perpendicular to the ﬂux lines (B · δu = 0). Thus, the
condition of (A.1.13) is written as
n · δu = 0.
(A.1.15)
This requires that ﬂux lines do not pass through the surface of the superconductor.

(A.3.3)
where iθ is the azimuthal unit vector. It is assumed that the quantized ﬂux line ﬂows
with velocity v along the x-axis, as discussed in Sect. 4.3. If the velocity of the
superconducting electron is vs, its gauge-invariant momentum is given by
m∗vs = ps + 2eA.
(A.3.4)
If we approximate that the magnetic ﬂux density B is almost uniform in the area
where the current ﬂows around the normal core of the quantized ﬂux line, we have
A = (Br/2)iθ. The force on the superconducting electron is denoted by f e. Then,
the equation of motion of the superconducting electron is

(A.3.5)
When the velocity of the quantized ﬂux line is small enough, we can approximate as

Derivation of (5.86)
Here, we discuss the structure of a partial ﬂux line lattice that is treated represen-
tatively in the statistical treatment. For this purpose, the pinning correlation lengths
are needed and the elastic moduli of the ﬂux line lattice are explained. There are
three independent elastic moduli and these are C11 for uniaxial compression, C44 for
bending deformation, and C66 for shear (see Fig. A.1). These are respectively given
by [2]

where b = B/μ0Hc2 is the reduced ﬁeld. The pinning correlation length is the
characteristic distance over which the interaction between ﬂux lines is shielded by
ﬂux pinning, and Campbell’s penetration depth given by (5.49) is one of the pinning
correlation lengths. Using (5.47), (5.49) is expressed as

(A.5.6)
If we assume that the sizes of a partial ﬂux line lattice along the direction of the
Lorentz force, the transverse direction, and the longitudinal direction, denoted by
Lx, Ly, and Lz are respectively proportional to the corresponding correlation lengths
L11, L66, and L44, we have

Note that LxLyLz = d3

Here we estimate K, deﬁned in (5.81). In the case where interactions of all
surrounding pinning centers become active, the surface of the region that we are
treating as representative will be displaced by x0− = u0 in the positive x-axis direc-
tion due to these interactions. As shown in Sect. 5.3, the ﬂux lines in the surrounding
region will be displaced as u(x) = u0 exp(−x/L11) at a position of distance x from the
surface, where L11 = λ

0. Thus, the surrounding pinning centers will push back with a
force proportional to this displacement. Thus, the elastic force from the surrounding

Derivation of (5.98)
Here we derive the condition of the minimum free energy given by (5.94) in volume
V of the superconductor. The displacement of ﬂux lines during minimization of the
free energy is denoted by u, and an additional small displacement is denoted by δu.
In this case the following condition should be satisﬁed:


[F(u + δu) −F(u)]dV = 0.

The ﬁrst term is expanded as
F(u + δu) = F(u) + ∂F

where u′ is deﬁned as

Input Energy and Increase in Magnetic Energy
All the energy that comes into the superconductor can be obtained using Poynting’s
vector. A part of it appears as magnetic energy in the superconductor, but some part
of it does not remain in the superconductor. It was shown in Sect. 5.7 that the energy
that has disappeared is work done by the driving force. How shall we understand this
phenomenon?
Here we discuss some practical cases. First we treat an irreversible phenomenon
as described by the critical state model. In this case, it can be expected that the lost
energy is exactly dissipated as a pinning loss. This will be proved here. Assume that
a magnetic ﬁeld with the magnetic ﬂux density B0 is applied along the z-axis parallel
to a semi-inﬁnite superconductor occupying x ≥0. If the critical current density is
denoted by Jc, the magnetic ﬂux distribution inside the superconductor is described
as
B(x) = B0 −μ0Jcx; 0 ≤x ≤B0/μ0Jc,
= 0;
x > B0/μ0Jc.
(A.7.1)
The induced electric ﬁeld during this process is directed along the y-axis and is given
by
E = −

B0/μ0Jc

∂t dx =

∂t .
(A.7.2)
Hence, Poynting’s vector on the superconductor surface is EB0/μ0 in magnitude
and directed into the superconductor. Thus, the energy that penetrates a unit cross-
sectional area of the superconductor during increasing magnetic ﬂux density from 0
to Bm is estimated as

which is equal to the difference between the input energy and the magnetic energy.
The reason for this result will be clear from (2.54). This is the reason why the loss
energy can be estimated by measuring Poynting’s vector [4].
Next we treat the case of reversible ﬂux motion. We assume that a sufﬁciently
high magnetic ﬁeld of magnetic ﬂux density Bm is applied again to the semi-inﬁnite
superconductor, and then, the external ﬁeld is slightly reduced by b0. The interior
magnetic ﬂux density is given by

(A.7.11)
This means that the energy exceeding the decrease in the magnetic energy inside the
superconductor goes out of the superconductor. It seems that a new form of energy
is born. (Note that b0/μ0λ
′
0 < 2Jc in the area of the reversible ﬂux motion.) It can
be shown that Uin −Um is equal to the work done by the driving force [5]. If the
external magnetic ﬁeld is increased from Bm −b0 to Bm after the above process, the
inner magnetic ﬂux distribution again obeys (A.7.7), but some energy disappears.
It is necessary to investigate the ﬂux pinning mechanism that determines the ﬂux
distribution in the superconductor to understand the physics in such cases, where
some energy seems to appear or disappear. Within the range of reversible ﬂux motion,
the pinning force is balanced with the driving force, but with some margin, because
of the pinning force density below the critical value, and the work done by the driving
force is stored as an increase in the pinning energy in the latter case. Since the pinning
energy is not a magnetic energy but a thermodynamic energy, the magnetic energy
disappears. In the former case, the pinning energy stored as the pinning energy
in the initial process to increase the magnetic ﬁeld to Bm partly goes out of the
superconductor during the process of decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, it can be
shown that the work done by the driving force is equal to the increase in the pinning
energy [5]. On the other hand, the pinning energy reaches the upper limit in the
critical state, and there is no room to store additional energy. Hence, the work done
by the driving force is dissipated by the motion of depinned ﬂux lines. This point will
also be discussed from a different viewpoint in Appendix 8. In the case where there
is no pinning effect, a uniform magnetic ﬂux distribution is attained by the driving
force, and the input energy is equal to the variation in the magnetic energy.
In the case of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect treated in Sect. 6.3, the energy
penetrating the superconductor during the process of introducing the force-free strain
is the work done by the driving torque. In this process the magnetic energy does not
change, and all of the input energy is stored as the pinning energy or dissipated. This
clearly shows that the critical current density in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is
also determined by the ﬂux pinning mechanism.
A.8
Helmholtz Free Energy and Gibbs Free Energy
The Ginzburg-Landau free energy is a kind of Helmholtz free energy, and it is
necessary to transform it to a Gibbs free energy by adding the Legendre term to
discuss the transition under a magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Sect. 4.2. It should be
noted that the Ginzburg-Landau equations do not change even under the Legendre
transformation. The Gibbs energy density corresponding to the Ginzburg-Landau
free energy density is
(A.8.1)

190
Appendix
where H0 is the external magnetic ﬁeld. The condition of the equilibrium state is
obtained from
, and it satisﬁes
∂F
∂B = H0.
(A.8.2)
The variation in the volume integral of the free energy density from (A.1.9) when
the vector potential changes by δA is given by
−

V
(H0 · ∇× δA)dV.
(A.8.3)
This is partially integrated, and neglecting the surface integral, we have
−

V
(δA · ∇× H0)dV = 0.
(A.8.4)
Thus, the Ginzburg-Landau equation (4.4) does not change. Equation (4.3) does not
change either.
The Gibbs free energy density should also be used for the electromagnetic
phenomena in a non-isolated ﬂux line system in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld. For
example, the Gibbs free energy density is given by
(A.8.5)
when a force of density F is added to the ﬂux line system, where u is the displacement
of ﬂux lines. This is minimized with respect to u, and from the condition
,
we have
F + Fp = 0,
(A.8.6)
where we used Fp = −∂F/∂u. The variation in the free energy density as a function
of the displacement of the ﬂux line system in the regime of reversible ﬂux motion is
illustrated in Fig. A.2. The spatial variation with period a comes from the ﬁrst term
of (A.8.5), including the pinning energy density, and the decrease with increasing
displacement comes from the second term. Point A at which the energy density is
locally a minimum gives the stable equilibrium position. The Legendre term for the
second term in (A.8.5) is derived using Poynting’s vector when we extend the ﬂux
line system from the isolated condition to the non-isolated one in the critical state
theory in Sect. 5.7. Such a washboard pinning potential is usually assumed when
discussing the ﬂux creep phenomena.

with period a with the

The gradual decrease with
increasing u comes from the
work done by the Lorentz
force. U0 is the pinning
potential, and U is the
activation energy
It is also necessary to use the Gibbs free energy density to treat the non-isolated
ﬂux line system in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, and the free energy density to be
minimized is
(A.8.7)
where  is the torque density and θ is the rotation angle of the ﬂux line system, with
both of them vectors along the rotation axis. The free energy density is minimized
with respect to θ, and we have
 + p = 0,
(A.8.8)
where p = −∂F/∂θ is the pinning torque density. The introduction of the second
term in (A.8.7) is important. In the usual transverse magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, F in
(A.8.5) is well known as the Lorentz force. On the other hand,  in the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld is unknown, and we have to derive it using Poynting’s vector.
The Legendre term to be added at the transformation is a part of the energy derived
using Poynting’s vector for the transverse magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration or all of it
for the rotating magnetic ﬁeld in the longitudinal ﬁeld conﬁguration. In the former
case, the remaining part of the energy is automatically included in the Helmholtz
free energy as an increase in the magnetic energy (see Sect. 5.7). In the usual case
of transportation of the current after application of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld,
the magnetic energy is similarly included, since the magnetic ﬁeld strength on the
surface is changed.

Two Kinds of Irreversibility
Here, we discuss two kinds of irreversibility. One of them is a general irreversibility
arising from the breaking of time reversal symmetry, and the other is caused by
different biased distributions of ﬂux lines in the potential well due to the instability
in ﬂux motion accompanied by a hysteresis, as shown in Chap. 5. In the latter case,
a reversible behavior is included, in which the time reversal symmetry is satisﬁed
and the irreversibility is independent of the breaking of time reversal symmetry. If
short, therefore, the irreversibility and energy dissipation are not identical in physics.
This is because it is possible to change over from an irreversible state to a lossless
reversible state. These two kinds of irreversibility are compared in Table A.1.
It is possible to theoretically derive the irreversibility of a closed magnetization
curve and to insist that energy dissipation equal to the area of the closed loop should
occur. Before the proof of the critical state theory, we could insist only that, if there
is no energy dissipation, it contradicts the experimental results. It is possible now to
say that if there is no energy dissipation, it contradicts the theoretical prediction. In
addition, the energy dissipation based on the loss mechanism assuming the breaking
of time reversal symmetry agrees with the energy dissipation calculated from the
critical state theory.
A.10
Theoretical Systems of Flux Pinning
Flux pinning phenomena are roughly classiﬁed into the equilibrium state (J = 0),
reversible state (0 < J < Jc), static critical state (J = Jc), quasi-static critical state
(J = Jc+0),and dynamic state (J > Jc), depending on the current density. The theo-
ries that explain these phenomena except for in the equilibrium state are the coherent
potentialapproximationtheory[6,7],thecriticalstatetheory,andthedynamiccritical
state model [8, 9] in this order (see Fig. A.3).
The former two theories are derived from ﬁrst principles, namely, minimization
of the energy, or do not contradict the principles. The dynamic critical state model is
an expansion of the critical state theory to the dynamic state with the assumption of
a viscous force. It should be noted that the condition of minimum energy dissipation
is satisﬁed in the quasi-static and dynamic states. That is, the pinning loss appears
in the superconductor, but it takes on a minimum value in these states. In addition,

Fig. A.3 Flux pinning phenomena and theoretical systems
the principle of minimum energy dissipation seems to work in determination of the
ﬂux bundle size under the effect of ﬂux creep or in sharing of pinning energy under
the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. This fact tells us that there is a possibility that this
principle may be applied more widely, i.e., to a system with small energy dissipation,
even though a dissipation mechanism is nonlinear. If the quantity associated with a
ﬂow such as the velocity of ﬂux lines is denoted by ε, the energy dissipation is
proportional to ε in the case of ﬂux pinning, while it is proportional to ε2 for the
usual linear dissipation systems.
Although energy dissipation occurs in the quasi-static critical state, the state at
each moment is equal to the prediction in the static critical state, and any variation
with time occurs only through the variation in an external parameter such as magnetic
ﬁeld or current. Thus, the static state varies continuously with time. For this reason,
ﬁrst principles can be applied empirically and overlap with the principle of minimum
energy dissipation in this region.
The same thing occurs in the case of longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect, and
the balance between the generalized force and ﬂux pinning interactions is derived
from the minimization of the energy. The force-free state is selected based on the
current ﬂow so as to satisfy the minimum energy dissipation, and the torque balance
determines the state.

Analysis of Penetration of Flux Lines
into a Superconducting Cylinder
Here, we analyze the penetration of ﬂux lines into a cylindrical superconductor in
a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld when current is applied, as treated in Sect. 6.1. The
external magnetic ﬁeld and self-ﬁeld due to the current are denoted by He and HI,

.
(A.11.1)
In the above, it is assumed that the self-ﬁeld is sufﬁciently smaller than the external
magnetic ﬁeld. Hence, the increase in the magnetic ﬂux density on the surface is
b0 = μ0H 2
I /2He. Here we estimate the current at which one layer of ﬂux lines
penetrates the superconductor. This is in the situation where the displacement of
ﬂux lines on the surface reaches the ﬂux line spacing, 380 nm. In the cylindrical
coordinates, the continuity equation of ﬂux lines (5.46) is written as
b = μ0He
R
∂(Ru)
∂R ,
(A.11.2)
where R is a distance from the central axis and u is the displacement. It is assumed
that b is uniform inside the superconductor. Since u is zero at the center (R = 0), the
displacement of ﬂux lines on the surface R = R0 is obtained as
u0 =
b
2μ0He
R0.
(A.11.3)
From the condition that this is equal to 380 nm, we have b = 0.13 × 10−4 [T],
where μ0He = 14 [mT] was used. Using (A.11.1), the self-ﬁeld is found to be 0.43
mT, and the corresponding current is 1.72 A. If ﬂux lines penetrate in a row, the
magnetization may change discontinuously, although no discontinuous change has
been observed. If it is assumed that a small number of ﬂux lines penetrate continu-
ously to make the change in the magnetization smooth, these ﬂux lines must incline
much more than the angle of the surface ﬁeld to produce a self-ﬁeld that satisﬁes the
boundary condition by themselves. For example, if we assume that only a quarter of
the ﬂux lines in a row penetrate at 0.43 A, a quarter of the current needed for one row
penetration (1.72 A), these ﬂux lines must have a four times larger inclination than
the surface ﬁeld to produce the required self-ﬁeld by themselves. This seems to be
unrealistic. In addition, if a row of ﬂux lines penetrates the superconductor transla-
tionally, all the current (1.72 A) must ﬂow within the depth of one ﬂux line spacing
(380 nm) from the surface. In this case, the current density reaches 9.0 ×108 A m−2,
which is very much larger than the observed critical current density, 1.5×107 A m−2.
If such a situation is continued up to the critical current, where the self-ﬁeld is 7.5
mT, the current is limited to within the depth of 0.12 mm from the surface. These
situations are quite different from the concept of the critical state. It is expected that
the current ﬂows through the whole cross-section of the superconductor in the critical
state, which requires that the inner ﬂux lines must also rotate when new ﬂux lines
penetrate. This also explains the continuous variation in the magnetization.

Appendix

A.12
On the Flux Cutting
Various contradictions that arise under the assumption that ﬂux lines must move
translationally have been evaded by assuming that ﬂux cutting exists. Almost all of
them can be reasonably explained, however, by the rotational motion of ﬂux lines
driven by the force-free torque, although it is not easy to directly identify which
mechanism is at work from the experimental results that have been explained by the
ﬂux cutting model. This is the reason why the ﬂux cutting model is used even now.
Hence, it is necessary to examine it theoretically from various aspects. In this section
the problems related to ﬂux cutting are comprehensively argued. An argument will
be presented following each viewpoint.
(1) No inevitability of ﬂux cutting
All of the electromagnetic phenomena that were believed to be explained only by
the ﬂux cutting, such as the deviation of the induced electric ﬁeld from Josephson’s
formula or the steady magnetization in the resistive state, as shown in Fig. 6.3, can
be explained without the ﬂux cutting. It is possible to raise other examples. This
is because the ﬂux cutting and ﬂux rotation are equivalent to each other from the
viewpoint of macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena.
This theoretical point was already presented in Sect. 6.1. That is, the ﬂux cutting
is a concept used to explain the phenomena by assuming Josephson’s relationship
for translational movement of each component of ﬂux lines, although Josephson’s
formula does not hold.
As shown in Sects. 5.7 and 6.3, and Appendix A.7, when a current is induced in
a superconductor by changing the external magnetic ﬁeld, the energy that invades
the superconductor exceeds the increase in the magnetic energy, and the excess
energy, i.e., the work done by the driving force or torque to release the strain of
ﬂux lines in the regime of reversible ﬂux motion, is stored as an increase in the
pinning energy. If the rotational shear distortion of ﬂux lines cannot be stabilized
by the pinning interaction in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, such an energy balance
cannot be explained, resulting in a theoretical contradiction. If it is assumed that ﬂux
cutting occurs in this situation, the excess energy is the magnetic energy itself of the
interacting ﬂux lines, as discussed in Sect. 6.1, and cannot be absorbed. Thus, there
is no inevitability of ﬂux cutting. Since this is in the regime of reversible ﬂux motion,
it is impossible to explain how the excess energy is dissipated due to ﬂux cutting.
In addition, the ﬂux cutting cannot be the mechanism that determines fundamental
phenomena such as the critical current density.
(2) No possibility for ﬂux cutting
Some processes of ﬂux cutting have been proposed, such as the inter-cutting process
in which ﬂux lines with different angles cut directly across each other, as shown
in Fig. 6.7, and the intra-cutting process in which such ﬂux lines recombine [6],
although any real process of ﬂux cutting has not been conﬁrmed. In addition, the

196
Appendix
mechanism for the work

E · Jdt done by the general restoring force has not been
clariﬁed in association with energy conservation. In reality this is the work done by
the torque, which exceeds the pinning interaction during the rotational motion of
ﬂux lines, similarly to the usual cases in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. We simply
discuss the process of the ﬂux cutting here, however, neglecting such an argument
on the fundamental aspects. To realize the ﬂux cutting, two ﬂux lines with different
angles must come close to each other against a strong repulsive force, but there is no
force to make the ﬂux lines come close to each other. Even if it were assumed that the
ﬂux cutting could happen, the theoretically estimated threshold value for the needed
current density is too high for both the inter-cutting and the intra-cutting processes,
and the observed critical current densities cannot be explained. It may be pointed
out that ﬂux cutting maybe easily take place at normal precipitates, etc. If this is so,
however, the ﬂux cutting maybe more easily occur in a superconductor with more
pinning centers, resulting in a lower critical current density. The practical situation is
the opposite, and such an insistence is meaningless. In reality, the ﬂux cutting does
not take place, since the rotational ﬂux motion with no threshold occurs ﬁrst.
Here, we introduce another experimental result that clearly shows that the ﬂux
cutting cannot take place. The experimental result shown in Fig. 6.15 clariﬁes that
the magnetic ﬂux distribution is exactly in the force-free state. The penetration depth
of the AC magnetic ﬂux approaches the value of about 10 μm in the limit of zero AC
ﬁeld amplitude, indicating that the motion of ﬂux lines is in the regime of reversible
ﬂux pinning. Since the ﬂux line spacing is about 90 nm under a DC magnetic ﬁeld
of 0.290 T, the variation in the external magnetic ﬁeld reaches the distance of about
100 rows of ﬂux lines from the surface in this situation. On the other hand, since the
ﬂux cutting is irreversible, the ﬂux cutting process must be completed by the row
behind to start the interaction with ﬂux lines on the next row. That is, the penetration
depth of the ﬂux cutting is on the order of the ﬂux line spacing, and the extension
of such a reversible phenomenon to 10 μm cannot be explained [5]. In reality the
rotational motion of ﬂux lines occurs, and it can extend to the shielding distance of
ﬂux pinning in the reversible regime. Thus, the observed reversible phenomenon can
be explained by the rotational motion of ﬂux lines. Since energy dissipation does not
occur by the mechanism of ﬂux cutting in this regime, the energy is not conserved
in the case of ﬂux cutting, as discussed in Sect. 6.3, resulting in a contradiction.
In addition, relativity is not satisﬁed for the ﬂux cutting between the case of
rotating the external magnetic ﬁeld and the case of rotating the superconductor in the
opposite direction in a stationary external magnetic ﬁeld (see p. 151 in [1]), although
the details are not shown here.
(3) No possibility of explanation by the ﬂux cutting
As described in Chap. 6, the following phenomena cannot be explained by the
mechanism of ﬂux cutting:
(a)
the paramagnetic effect in the usual process of application of current after
applying an external magnetic ﬁeld,
(b) a critical current density that depends on the ﬂux pinning strength, especially,
very small critical current densities for weak pinning,

Appendix
197
(c)
the structure of electric ﬁelds in the resistive state, including the negative ﬁeld
that appears on the surface,
(d) the appearance of a radial electric ﬁeld component in the resistive state, and
(e)
the resistivity that follows the Bardeen-Stephen model.
(a) and (d) can be explained only by movement of the longitudinal magnetic ﬂux
componentandcannotbeexplainedbytheﬂuxcuttingmodel,whichassumesonlythe
motion of the transverse component. (e) shows that the energy dissipation occurs in
the whole length of the normal core in each ﬂux line, while the energy dissipation may
occur only in the region of cutting in the ﬂux cutting model, resulting in appreciably
smaller electrical resistivity than in the theoretical prediction of the Bardeen-Stephen
model.
Other phenomena that cannot be explained by the ﬂux cutting model are
(f)
the occurrence of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld effect, even when the external
magnetic ﬁeld and current are simultaneously increased so that the angle of the
total magnetic ﬁeld on the surface does not change, as shown in Fig. 6.22, and
(g) the helical ﬂow of current to produce the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld in the
resistive state when only the current is applied, as shown in Fig. 6.21.
Since the angle of the total magnetic ﬁeld is not changed, the condition of the
ﬂux cutting is not fulﬁlled. In more detail, the process is quite opposite to the ﬂux
cutting, i.e., the appearance of ﬂux lines with different angles from ﬂux lines directed
in the same direction, must occur to explain the phenomena in (f). It is also possible
to point out as follows:
(h) The reason why the force-free state is realized cannot be explained, even though
the ﬂux pinning governs the phenomena.
These points, (f), (g), and (h), are explained by the principle of irreversible ther-
modynamics, in which the direction of current is determined so as to minimize the
energy dissipation.
A.13
Magnetic Helicity in the Force-Free State
In the force-free state where the current density J is parallel to the magnetic ﬂux
density B, it can be expressed as J = kB, using a scalar function k. In this case we
have
∇× J = k∇× B −B × ∇k = μ0k2B −B × ∇k.
(A.13.1)
This quantity is not zero, since the ﬁrst term is parallel to B, and the second term
is normal to B. In fact, we have ∇× J =

α2
f /μ0

B from (6.10) and (6.14). On
the other hand, the static electric ﬁeld must satisfy ∇× E = 0. Hence, the electric
resistivity must be zero. Thus, the static force-free state can be achieved only in
superconductors.

Fig. A.4 Magnetic ﬁelds Bφ

and Bcs produced by a
central solenoid coil, and
induced current I
When the magnetic helicity is not zero, we have A · B ̸= 0. In this case the vector
potential A has a component parallel to B. Since A is parallel to J, as shown by (2.28)
or (4.15), J has a force-free component parallel to B. Thus, the perfect force-free
state (J∥B) is the state with the maximum magnetic helicity (A∥B).
In a tokamak fusion reactor, a ring magnetic ﬁeld (Bφ) is produced by a current
ﬂowing in toroidal coils placed in a doughnut shape, as illustrated in Fig. A.4. A
normal pulsed magnetic ﬁeld (Bcs) produced by a central solenoid coil induces a ring
current I through a plasma inside the toroidal coils to heat up the plasma, resulting in
fusion. In this case, a magnetic situation similar to that in a superconductor in a longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld is realized. In fact, the force-free state is theoretically derived
by minimizing the magnetic energy in the plasma under a ﬁxed magnetic helicity
[7, 8]. Although the induced current and magnetic helicity will surely decrease with
time due to Joule heating, similar electromagnetic phenomena to the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effect in the superconductor occur within a short period. There is no
merit in achieving the force-free state in the plasma, however, such as an increase in
the critical current density in the superconductor, and even the energy loss increases
by making a longer current path. Thus, the energy dissipation is not minimized for
the plasma. On the other hand, it is considered that the state of minimum energy that
is achieved leads to a mechanical equilibrium.

Electromagnetic Phenomena in High-Temperature
Superconductors
The characteristic points of electromagnetic phenomena in high-temperature super-
conductors are brieﬂy introduced here. High-temperature superconductors have alter-
native layered structures composed of CuO2 planes that show the superconductivity
and almost insulating block layers that provide carriers to the CuO2 planes. For this
reason, these superconductors have large anisotropy with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld angle. That is, the upper critical ﬁeld is very high in the direction parallel to
the CuO2 plane, while it is relatively low in the direction parallel to the c-axis. This
is caused by the anisotropy of the coherence length, which is extremely short along
the c-axis.

202
Appendix
Since the superconducting region is limited, the condensation energy is relatively
low in spite of its very high critical temperature. This restricts the strength of ﬂux
pinning, resulting in low critical current densities. In addition, these superconductors
are mostly used at high temperatures, the effect of thermal activation is big, and ﬂux
creep occurs easily, which allows pinned ﬂux lines to easily escape from the pinning
centers. Hence, the critical current density decreases even more, and the supercon-
ducting current, which has been believed to be a persistent current, decreases with
time. Thus, the irreversibility ﬁeld at which the critical current density goes to zero
is much lower than the upper critical ﬁeld at high temperatures. This trend is much
stronger in superconductors with larger anisotropy, and Bi-2212 superconductor is
a typical example. RE-123 (RE: rare earth element) superconductor has the lowest
anisotropy among the high-temperature superconductors, and the effect of ﬂux creep
is not so strong. Hence, application of this superconductor is expected.
The ﬂux pinning properties of high-temperature superconductors are complicated
on the temperature versus magnetic ﬁeld plane in comparison with metallic super-
conductors. This is caused by the fact that the situation of the pinned ﬂux line lattice
varies greatly. The variation depends strongly on the anisotropy, and the changes also
depend on the kind or strength of the pinning centers. The energies that determine
the behavior of the ﬂux line system are the elastic energy UE of the ﬂux line lattice,
the pinning energy UP, and the thermal energy UT. Hence, there are three kinds of
transition that are determined mostly by two energies. These are the melting tran-
sition between UE and UT, the glass-liquid transition between UP and UT, and the
order-disorder transition between UE and UP [9]. Thus, the mixed state in the phase
diagram on the magnetic ﬁeld vs. temperature plane is divided up in a complicated
way, which is quite different from the simple mixed state discussed for metallic
superconductors.
Another characteristic point is that the superconductivity depends quite sensitively
on the carrier density. In polycrystalline superconductors, the superconductivity is
easily broken at grain boundaries due to a large distortion or a local deviation from
the stoichiometric composition that reduces the carrier density. For this reason, the
density of the superconducting current that can tunnel through grain boundaries is
quite low for polycrystalline superconductors. It is necessary to fabricate supercon-
ductors with highly aligned crystal axes to obtain a high critical current density as in
metallic superconductors. Hence, tapes of RE-123 superconductor are now fabricated
by using a highly developed thin ﬁlm technique that can realize a polycrystalline long
tape about 1 km in length with a highly aligned tri-axial structure. On the other hand,
this property provides very strong pinning forces for point defects or dislocations,
which are known as weak pinning centers in metallic superconductors, because the
superconductivity will be lost in such defects due to variation in the carrier density.
Such a high crystalline alignment is not achieved in Bi-2223 tapes, and their critical
current density is lower by about two orders of magnitude in comparison with RE-
123. But the thickness of the superconductor is much larger than that of RE-123 thin
ﬁlms, and the engineering critical current density divided by the cross-sectional area
of the tape is not signiﬁcantly different between the two superconductors.
