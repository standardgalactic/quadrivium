THE BASIC SKULL

CHAPTER 1: THE BASIC SKULL        5
We are all very much alike—but our faces portray unique differences, 
as demonstrated by these people who claim ancestry from around the world.

All humans have a common ancestry.  Our faces and bodies may portray unique 
differences, but we are all very much alike.  A clear explanation of where we 
all come from is not yet agreed upon by human society—though social and 
behavioral anthropologists, religious institutions, science ﬁction writers, and 
cultural philosophers have all chimed in.  We cannot say for certain how and 
where our minute differences in physical construct originated.  We only know 
that people from different parts of the world show tendencies common to the 
founding families of their communities.  To mix things all up, humans have 
wandered off to new lands to make families in faraway communities each and 
every generation since humans could travel.  
 
The author’s perspective in this book is that the earth is one giant ball of 
meshed genes.  In areas where lines of a family have existed for centuries, 
certain physical attributes may dominate a human settlement. These attributes 
are further enhanced by the diet of that region (for example, whether meat 
is a staple), how much sunlight is experienced in a common day, and what 
mutations survive in this environment.  Forensic anthropology supplies us with 
rich information and empirical data on regional characteristics.  These physical 
attributes are tools for character designers whose game, toy, and ﬁlm products 
are now on the world stage.  It is more important than ever for character 
designers to research the communities they wish to portray.  Why?  The people 
who live in those regions want to be respected through the accurate portrayal 
of their physical characteristics.  People will bond with characters they identify 
with.  The character designer is a critical link to creating international appeal.
 
In this text, we explore the unique features present in the human face, and 
provide comparison to skulls found near a model’s claim of ancestral lineage. 
We will present models from all over the world for you to analyze for regional 
traits as a stepping stone into creating your own research.  The results of our 
photo shoot study are fascinating.  We consider this book an important snap 
THE HUMAN FACE

shot in time cataloging what a piece the human looks like today.  In another 
generation, our genes will have pooled again—taking us another giant step 
further away from regional identiﬁcation.
 
In some cases, we can readily identify someone’s ancestral lineage as 
having resided in regions around Asia, Africa, the Americas, or Europe, among 
others.  In some cases, we cannot readily identify someone as having ancestors 
born in or near any region—as the model will show characteristics common 
to several regions.  This is valuable to know too, as it makes us aware that we 
cannot stereotype a feature to a region.  Our study will also explore what makes 
the typical female face unique to the typical male face.  Structural differences 
between the two are sometimes very subtle, depending on the individual.  
We have provided the measurements of every face so that you can compare 
and contrast features on your favorite models.
 
The next generation born will make a huge change in our physical 
identity.  Transportation has become much cheaper and safer.  We have 
models in this text claiming globally opposite genetic heritage—lineage from 
countries as far away from each other as Ireland and Malaysia, or Africa, the 
Philippines, and the United States.  We are no longer isolated communities 
of limited gene pools.  
CHAPTER 1: THE BASIC SKULL        7
A family from China.

It may appear unusual to you that we are organizing people by self-
identiﬁed region of ancestry instead of ethnicity.  Race is a recent classiﬁcation 
of people, and some consider it an unfair method.  Human evolution, racial 
mapping, and ethnicity are hotly debated topics amongst anthropologists. 
The authors of this text are not anthropologists.  We are artists in search 
of research material to provide a greater depth to our character designs. 
We are in search of identiﬁable physical characteristics typical in some ancestral 
lineages, whose understanding will allow us to create a believable diversity in 
3D character modeling.  Our goal is to gather visual information about the many 
diverse populations living on earth and use this information to discover the rich 
details that make us each unique race.  We do not create this text to identify 
one ethnicity with tiny noses, thin lips, or bulbous ear lobes.  Rather, we seek to 
celebrate the unique features that provide information about how our ancestors 
traveled, and how these travels inﬂuence character design.

Mother and daughter. 

Humans do not have physical differences based on which side of 
a country’s border they are born on.  The border was not always there. 
And, as in the case of Russia, borders can change in just one generation. 
So, we will avoid stating that a person looks a certain way because it is a 
common trait in a certain country.  We will instead map our models to different 
regions in the world, and hope in time to grow a large database of such images 
that all artists can draw from.  For the sake of our study, we will allow all of 
the models to self-identify their ancestral homes by the name of the country 
their parents came from.  We were unable to cover every country in the world 
with our small sample, but we do have a disparate sample from around the 
globe.  We hope this is enough to raise awareness of morphological variation 
in the human species.

10        CHAPTER 1: THE BASIC SKULL
Historically, the organization of regional ancestral lineage was based 
on a method of categorization initiated by Dr. W.W. Howells (1973, 1989, 
1995) and his long-term study of craniometric variation in modern humans. 
He categorized ancestral lineage from six world regions:  Europe, Sub-Saharan 
Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East.  
Today, the United Nations has unofﬁcially categorized member states 
into ﬁve geopolitical regional groups, and one non-UN member group.  These 
groups are:  the African group, the Asia-Paciﬁc group, the Eastern European 
group, the Latin American and Caribbean group, the Western European and 
others group, and the non-UN state or territory.  The groups span across 
continents, but Africa’s region stays central to its continent.
Anthropologists once used Typology to categorize members of the human 
species by physical traits such as head shape, skin color, hair form, body build 
and stature back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Caleton S. Coon 
created the ﬁve classiﬁcations.  The typological model divided people from 
different ethnic regions into races.  He labeled them, in 1962, as:  Negroid 
race, Caucasoid race, Mongoloid race, Australoid race, and Capoid race.  
Typology is now considered by some a contributor to racism and no longer 
used to categorize people.    
Empirical evidence has shown that geographic variation actually has 
very little to do with why we look different from each other.  Professor John 
Relethford, from the State University of York College at Oneonta, states that 
previous studies of genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA have found that 
the amount of variation among major geographic groupings of Homo sapiens 
is relatively low, accounting for roughly 10% of total variation (Relethford, 
1994).  These data were derived from six core areas: Europe, Sub-Saharan 
Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An additional 
set of analyses was performed using a three-region subset (Europe, Sub-
Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability with several genetic 
studies.  Relethford (1994) determined that there is little limited variation in 
modern human skulls among major geographic regions.

University Press.

Relethford (1994) states that a great deal of genetic variation is 
among individuals within groups, and physical differences are not due to 
variation among groups.  This further negates the Typology system of racial 
classiﬁcation.  Authors Stringer and Andrews (1988) state that humans show 
“great morphological variation.  However, in contrast to this, genetic variation 
between human populations is low overall” (p. 1264).  
If we are all so similar, why is it we are able to distinguish the features 
of people from regions other than our own, and identify them as from a 
different part of the world?  Our eye is ﬁnely tuned to this small percentage 
of genetic and sexual variation.  Let’s look at the structure of a basic human 
skull so that we have a common ground to base our comparisons.

Anatomists have determined from head and skull shape that there are three 
types of heads.  Look for them in the following photos. They use a term for 
measurement of the head, cephalic index, to determine these head types.  
The three classiﬁcations are: 
1.  Dolichochocephalic:  long head
2.  Mesocephalic:  medium head
3.  Brachycephalic:  broad head

HUMAN HEAD:  
ESTABLISHING A VOCABULARY
 
These are three images of a human skull.  I won’t tell you the region this is from 
yet.  It looks like a basic human skull right?  How would you know what part of 
the world it came from?  Markers exist on this skull that will allow you to identify 
features typical to human identity form different regions around the world.  We 
hope to provide you with an introductory understanding of these markers so 
that you can be aware of how they structurally inﬂuence facial characteristics, 
and have been found in larger samples to provide evidence of characteristics 
typical to a region.

GENERAL  TERMS
Please consult an anatomy book for the most accurate description of terms.  
The terms are listed for visual reference on the skulls, followed by a general 
description of their location.
 Anterior—toward the front of the body
  Lateral—extending away from the middle, moving towards 
the side of the body
 Median—midline, going through the center of the head
  Medial—extending towards the middle, moving away from 
the side of the body
 Posterior—toward the back of the body
 Superior—toward the top
 Inferior—toward the bottom
 
Interocular distance:  this measurement is the distance between the eyes, 
and is also commonly referred to as the interpupillary distance.
Nasal root:  the nasal root is found at the top of the nose.  It is where the 
nasal bone meets the frontal bone.
Zygomatic bone:  this is the term for the cheek bone.
Nasal aperture:  the nasal aperture describes the width, length and depth of 
the nose, seen when looking upward at the nostrils.
Anterior nasal spine:  this is at the bottom of the nose above the teeth, and 
is a small sharp protrusion from the skull.
Nasal sill:  this is the ﬂoor of the nasal opening.  It is best viewed upwards 
facing the nostrils.  It is the bottom of the nose, with the nostrils above it and 
the tip of the nose above the nostrils.
Maxillary dental arcade:  this is the bone that holds the upper teeth of 
the mouth.
Maxillary incisors:  front teeth in the upper jaw.
Incisal bite:  this refers to how the upper and lower teeth meet—the bite.
Alveolar prognathism:  jaw protruding forward.
Post-bregmatic depression:  a dent in the top of the skull.
18        CHAPTER 1: THE BASIC SKULL

Sutures:  these are the ﬁbrous joints in the skull.  There are many of them 
that join together the many pieces of the skull.
Nuchal lines:  these lines are four curved ridges on the occipital bone, 
found on the back bottom of the skull.
External occipital protuberance:  this runs between the nuchal lines.
Mastoid process:  this is the bony protrusion found behind the ear.
Temporal lines:  these two lines cross the middle of the parietal bone.
Supraorbital tori:  this is the bony ridge above the eye sockets.
Masseteric tuberosities:  this refers to the rough surface on the mandible bone.
Occipital condyles:  these are ﬂat surfaces under the occipital bone.
Supramastoidal crest:  this is the ridge that forms at the root of the zygomatic 
process of the temporal bone.
Mandibular ramus:  part of the jaw.
CHAPTER 1: THE BASIC SKULL        19

Knowing these key terms and where these features are located will give 
us a starting place to compare other skulls too.  This comparison will allow 
us to identify features that are different in different faces.  We will often refer 
to this anatomical vocabulary when making observations about human faces.  
Memorize these terms and what they represent, as they will be used extensively 
in Chapter 2.  Please ﬁnd additional anatomy books that detail the human skull 
for additional information.  We are artists, and specialists in anatomy will give 
you more information on speciﬁc bones than we can.

These are illustrations of basic muscle groups attached to the skull. 
The size of these groups may vary in different faces.  Fat deposits rest on top 
of these muscle groups, further impacting the facial features of our models.  
Facial anatomy is very extensive, and I urge you to couple your study of these 
faces with a facial anatomy text book.  Our observations will only consult the 
basic skull.

ASIAN MALE ROBUST SKULL
Features of this skull:
The discriminate function analysis program, FORDISC 3.0, classiﬁes the skull as 
American Indian with a posterior probability of 0.996. This classiﬁcation is further 
substantiated by the presence of shovel-shaped incisors and multiple Wormian bones 
in lambdoidal suture. The face is broad, and the nasal aperture is wide. The nasal sill 
is smooth and guttered. Differentiation of Asian and American Indian is difﬁcult, if not 
impossible, given the information available.
The nasal aperture is somewhat rounded, not vertical as in persons of European 
origin. The nasal sill ﬂows inward across a mild gutter from the alveolar ridge. The 
nasal spine is present but not prominent. These are traits associated with persons 
of non-European origin.
Posterior View of Skull Multiple Wormian bones (sutural bones) can be seen within 
the lambdoidal suture. This condition is typical in individuals of Asian origin.
Note also the extremely large external occipital protuberance and crest-like inferior 
nuchal lines, both masculine traits.
Features of the sex:
The skull displays extreme masculine traits. The supraorbital ridge is large, the 
supraorbital margin is rounded, and the jaw is massive. The gonial angle is close 
to 90 degrees and strongly ﬂared.
Frontal View of Skull The skull displays extremely masculine traits. The supraorbital 
ridge is large, the supraorbital margin is well-rounded, and the jaw is massive. The 
gonial angle is strongly ﬂared.
Lateral View of Neurocranium The lateral and posterior views of the skull are 
also impressively masculine. The suprameatal crest (also called a “zygomatic arch 
extension”) is sharply deﬁned, and the mastoid processes are large. The external 
occipital protuberance is enormous, and the inferior nuchal lines are almost crest-like.
Estimated age: Early 20s

AMERICAN INDIAN FEMALE SKULL
Features of this skull:
The interocular distance is not prominently widened. The nasal root is depressed and 
the nasal angle is obtuse. The robust zygomatic bones are broad. The nasal aperture is 
somewhat narrow superiorly and inferiorly. The anterior nasal spine is very short, and the 
inferior nasal margin is smooth and depressed; there are no gutters, nor is there a sill.
The maxillary dental arcade has a somewhat round-to-rectangular shape. There is no 
alveolar prognathism. Due to the severe degree of attrition, it is not possible to assess for a 
shovel-shape on the single remaining maxillary incisor (2.1 [#9]). There is no post-bregmatic 
depression. The calvarial sutures are complex.
Features of the sex:
There is mild prominence of the cranial sites for musculofascial attachment including 
especially:
 the nuchal lines
 the mastoid processes of the temporal bones (slight)
 the temporal lines (slight)
 the supraorbital tori (slight)
 the occipital condyles
 the supramastoidal crest
There is a broad ascending mandibular ramus. The gonion angles ﬂare slightly. 
The nasion is smooth, and the supraorbital margins are blunted. The inferior border 
of the mandible is rounded.

Measurements of each skull
Take a look at this chart. The measurements of each skull are identiﬁed. Notice the disparity 
between each measurement and each skull. No two skulls are alike. Look at the female 
measurements as a whole, and compare them to the male measurements. Does one group 
appear larger? Does one group appear smaller? This chart should emphasize the value of 
measuring your subjects with calipers and recording the data.

THE BASIC SKULL
C H A P T E R  2 :
3 D  T U T O R I A L

70        CHAPTER 2: 3D TUTORIAL
The ﬁrst tutorial is designed to get you thinking about bones, speciﬁcally the 
major bony landmark forms of the skull that lie under all the soft tissue and 
how they differ amongst diverse populations. In this tutorial we are going to 
build a basic skull similar to the one shown above based on our Bone Clones 
reference. At the end of the tutorial you will be directed to the resources 
to repeat this process for three more variants of the human skull. These are 
intended to be useful for you to refer back to in the future when observing 
different facial features.
For this tutorial we will focus on the Asian male skull. At the end of the 
tutorial you will repeat the process with the Asian female, African male, and 
Australian Aboriginal male skulls. It is important to remember that there is 
no deﬁnitive set of facial characteristics that represent any population in 
their entirety. The majority of individuals you will observe may have some 
combination of features unique to themselves. These examples begin to give 
you tools for comparison, not absolute deﬁnitions.
Basic shape of the skull.

CHAPTER 2: 3D TUTORIAL        71
When trying to identify characteristic differences related to ancestral 
populations, consider the following features:
 Relative robustness—gracile qualities of the cranium.
 Nasal root: the bridge of the nose—does it insert high or low into the 
brow and what is the angle of the nasal bone in proﬁle?
 Interocular distance: basically, how wide the eyes are set, but also how far 
apart the medial edge of the left orbital opening is from the right (tear duct 
to tear duct in basic terms). 
Front views of Aboriginal, African male, African American male, Asian male, Asian robust male.
American Indian female, African American female, Asian female, European female.
Interocular distance, left to right: African American Male, African Male, Asian Male, European Male.

 Relative squareness/roundness of the orbital cavities.
 Sweep of the zygomatic bones—are they sweeping backward away from 
the front plane of the face or staying primarily in the plane of the face?
Front view: Aboriginal, African and Asian skulls.
View looking down: Asian, African, Caucasian.
72        CHAPTER 2: 3D TUTORIAL

 Prognathism—basically how far forward are the upper and lower jaws 
relative to the rest of the skull? This can also involve the relative forward 
angle of the front teeth. In proﬁle this would be the basic tilt of the face 
between the forehead and jaw
 Supraorbital Tori—prominence of the brows
—Asian male, African American male, Aboriginal male

Use the following images as visual reference for the locations and basic forms 
listed on the previous page:
All the tutorials in this book are written non-application speciﬁc. The reader 
can approach these tutorials in the way that they are most comfortable with, 
either digital or traditional techniques. Files for a base model:

as well as image planes
 
\tutorials\tutorial1\image_planes\
 
and corresponding markers

 are provided on the companion website for users of digital sculpting 
and modeling applications. 
 
 The measurements provided in the chart earlier in this chapter can be 
used with calipers for readers who are working in clay.
 
One of the trickier aspects in the digital model creation process is matching 
exactly source photography to a digital model in a synthetic camera. 
While there are various techniques and specialized tools used in studio 
environments, in the major digital sculpture applications you cannot exactly 
match real world cameras and the barrel distortion created by lenses. So, 
you should not expect to get an exact 1:1 relationship between your model 
and reference photographs. Ideally you want to know the focal length of the 
camera lens that the photos were shot with and try to match that as best 
you can. This is why (as you will see in the following tutorials) the authors 
recommend using reference photography in combination with the provided 
measurement markers along with your eye to evaluate the model. For 
traditional sculptors this will be more familiar.

TUTORIAL: 
THE BASIC ASIAN MALE SKULL
We are focusing on the larger landmark forms of the skull in this tutorial, 
as such we will not be diving into the small details. Once the student feels 
comfortable with their results, they should feel free to go into as much detail 
as they wish.
Open your application of choice. Import the following images from the 
companion website as image planes for reference:
 
\tutorials\tutorial1\front_asian_male.jpg
 
\tutorials\tutorial1\side_asian_male.jpg 
Asian male skull.
CHAPTER 2: 3D TUTORIAL        75

Now import:
 
\tutorials\tutorial1\markers\asian_make_markers.obj
 
If necessary, align the image plane to the marker geometry:
Import the ﬁle:
 
\tutorials\tutorial1\base_skull.obj
The skull starter geometry should sit very roughly within the marker geometry 
and the skull shape of the image plane. If for any reason it doesn’t , move/scale 
the skull geometry with the side view image plane so that with the external 
acoustic meatus (ear hole) aligned between the image and model the crown to 
chin height of the geometry matches the photo.
The starter skull geometry is generic in its proportions. Notice both the forward 
tilt of the face from brow to chin in this example (prognathism) as well as the 
depth of the anterior (front) plane of the cheek bones in the photo reference.
Using your applications move tool with a large diameter/fall off, begin to match 
the basic silhouette of the geometry to the skull being careful to ignore the 
skull stand at the base of the skull. Reﬁne the silhouette by gradually reducing 
the size of your move tool to get the ﬁner angles after the big forms are in

Once the proﬁle is accurate, what is left is locating the depth of certain 
landmark points in horizontal space. To do this we will use a combination of 
the front view, the markers, and the 3/4 view. The method that we are going 
to use is to have the imported markers overlaid on the starter skull with the 
front image plane offset to the side to evaluate your progress on reshaping 
the skull. The markers were generated from measurements off one side of the 
skull, so they are set up symmetrically. The skull is not perfectly symmetrical, 
so the positions of the markers are an approximate guide. The photographs 
should be your ultimate guide for evaluation.

Suggested setup for 
evaluating front view.
CHAPTER 2: 3D TUTORIAL        77

You should switch back and forth between the front and side views to 
evaluate your progress. Once you’re basically satisﬁed with your front and 
side views, you should import one or more of the front angle views to do a 
ﬁnal evaluation before we move on to focus on ﬁnalizing the landmark forms.
What you should have at this point is a loose approximation of the Asian 
male skull. Now we are going to start to “chisel into the planes and forms 
that will help you to begin to understand what’s at the core of making each 
face look like a face and how the position and proportions vary.
The ﬁrst area we are going to clearly deﬁne is the zygomatic region (cheek 
bone and most of eye socket). Referring to the images below and the 
reference photography of the Asian male skull, attempt to reﬁne the region 
indicated:

78        CHAPTER 2: 3D TUTORIAL

A couple of important things to keep in mind as you work:
The eye socket in this individual is fairly round. Eye sockets vary from round 
to square between sexes and ethnic groups. As mentioned earlier, the 
anterior plane of the cheek bone is fairly front facing. In the side view, the 
outer corner of the plane is not much further back than where it inserts at the 
maxilla. This “sweep” of the outer corner of the zygomatic will retreat more 
or less towards the rear of the skull in different ethnic groups.

Next we will deﬁne the planes of the nasal cavity.
Now proceed to reﬁning the brow and forehead region:

While the focus of this book is primarily on the face, we will take a 
moment to look at the posterior forms of the skull:

CHAPTER 3: FEMALE FACES        89
The female face is featured in this chapter.  Each female will be featured 
in a turn-around.  Each model’s description will include measurements taken 
with calipers, and the country the person claims ancestry from.  
Chapter 2 demonstrated the difference in size found between the sample 
male and female skulls we have.   What did you notice?  
The female face is usually smaller and softer than the male face. 
The forehead is a bit more upright and smooth.  The female mandible is 
proportionally smaller, the angle of the jaw is less deﬁned, and the chin 
is more pointed.  Did you notice that even the teeth are smaller on the 
female than on the male counterpart?

around the world.

THE NOSE
C H A P T E R  3 :

266        CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL
Basic planes of the nose.
Basic anatomy of the nose.
Like all other aspects of anatomy, there are basic anatomical forms that make 
up all noses. What varies is the relative proportion and to a certain extent 
relative positions of those forms.
The ﬁgures below show the basic bone and cartilage anatomical elements 
that construct the shape of all human noses.
Glabella
Lateral Nasal 
Cartilage
Major Alar Cartilage
Septal Cartilage
Minor Alar Cartilage
Nasal Bone

CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL        267
Basic muscles.
Form relations.
In addition there are small muscles that will contribute to a smaller or greater 
extent to surface form depending on the individual and the facial expression. 
These muscles are the Nasalis, Procurus, Orbicularis Oculi, Corrugator, and 
Levator Labii Superioris Alaeque:
For the purposes of this tutorial, we are only concerned with how these 
muscles can affect surface form in a neutral facial pose. In the ‘form 
relations’ ﬁgure below you will see a simple example of how these forms 
translate into surface detail:
Procerus
Corrugator
Orbicularis Oculi 
Nasalis
Levator Labii
superioris alaeque

Model reference.
African American female skull.
There are also intersecting forms surrounding the nose that you will need to 
consider. These will be shown in the tutorial below as well as in other tutorials 
in this book in more detail.
We will now walk through the construction of a basic nose using a basic 
version of our Bone Clones African American Female skull along with one of 
our female African American models.
The ﬁles can be found on the companion website.

Starting point of tutorial. Transparency added to skin object to show alignment.
TUTORIAL
Import  \tutorials\tutorial2\female_african_nose_baseform.obj into your 
sculpting application. You may wish to assign a brightly colored material to 
the base form model so you can see it clearly where it penetrates your sculpt. 
Lock the base form model so you don’t accidentally alter it.
Import \tutorials\tutorial2\base_nose_skin.obj model. You should see 
something like this:
Skull measurements are provided (\tutorials\tutorial2\african_fem_skull_meas.
txt) for traditional sculptors who want to block out the skull form in clay. You 
will need to approximate your own cartilage and eye forms using the photos 
provided.
While this tutorial may have a bit of a forensic reconstruction feel to it, what 
the goal really is to have you both thinking about the anatomical forms that 
rest directly below the skin surface and give you a tangible way to evaluate 
your work.
Subdivide the base skin model 1–2 times (less is better: keeping the poly 
count as low as possible as you build up form is the best practice and only 
increase subdivisions when you no longer have enough resolution to create 
the forms you need). Begin by making the images of the model available 
CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL        269

Areas to focus on the skull, 
and model photo.
to refer to either an image viewer onscreen, as image planes in your sculpture 
program or as printouts.
The ﬁrst step will be to deﬁne the gabella, nasal bone, and the border of the 
orbital cavity. These landmarks will give you structure to begin seating the 
features of the face within. Keep in mind that while the skull is representative 
of a typical African American female skull, it will only loosely correspond to the 
model’s features. So use her photos as a loose guide, but in this exercise focus 
on the base form of the provided geometry as a guide for positioning features.
You should make the overall shape of the skin geometry conform to the base 
form so that none of the skull is penetrating (with the exception of the nose 
cartilage forms for now). Once that is complete, focus your effort on roughing-
in the bony areas mentioned above. When complete, your ﬁrst step should 
look something like this:
270        CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL

The next step will be to ﬁll in the nose cartilage area, again using the base 
form as a template for the surface you are creating. Try adding one cartilage 
form at a time so that you get a feel for those forms and memorize them. 
Keep referring back to the model photos as reference for the surface forms 
that you are trying to create.
CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL        271

At this point you have blocked out the basic nose forms. Now we need to 
be concerned with the forms that surround the nose and how they interact. 
The ﬁrst area we will address is the barrel of the mouth.
There is a decent amount of thickness to the ﬂesh that covers the maxilla 
(upper jawbone/teeth) and there is a distinct barrel shape in most people of 
this form. The important thing to think about for now is the area where the 
nose and upper lip come together. The teardrop shaped cleft in the center 
that runs to the base of the nose is called the philtrum.  The way the forms 
transition from the nostrils to the upper lip and the interconnection between 
the philtrum and the base of the nose are important things to observe 
carefully.
The ﬁnal area we are going to look at is the nasal labial fold.
The nasal labial fold is the characteristic crease from the rear edge of the 
nostril to the region near the corners of the mouth. It includes a fat pad that 
covers the zygomatic muscles that travel from the cheek bone to the corner 
of the lips.
272        CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL

CHAPTER 3: 3D TUTORIAL        273
In the next tutorial we will cover the eye and we will revisit this project to 
ﬁnish the eye, brow cheek and temple areas.
Now that you have walked though one example, use the resources provided 
in the folder for this chapter’s tutorial to complete three more nose studies of 
an Asian male and an African American male. The Caucasian male resources 
ﬁles used at the beginning of this tutorial are also provided.

\tutorials\tutorial2\asian_male.jpg 
 
\tutorials\tutorial2\african_american_male.jpg
Noses can appear very differently in different individuals, but if you keep in 
mind the basic anatomy that makes up all noses, you should have the tools 
for evaluating and constructing what you see in your subjects.

CHAPTER 4: MALE FACES        277
The male face is featured in this chapter. Each male will be featured in a 
turn-around. Each model’s description will include measurements taken with 
calipers, and the country the person claims ancestry from.
You will notice when comparing the page of male skulls to the page of 
female skulls that the male skull is generally more angular than the female 
skull.  Notice the forehead. The male forehead is more sloping. The ridge 
area is more pronounced too. The lower half of the face is larger on the 
male than on the female. This can be seen in the acute angle of the jaw, the 
square, pronounced chin, and the greater mass of muscle tissue. Notice, 
though, that this mass is more muscular. There is less fat in the male face.

EYE TUTORIAL
C H A P T E R  4 :
3 D  T U T O R I A L

Load your model from the nose tutorial, or import from the 
companion website:
/tutorials/eye_tutorial/eye_starter.obj
Use the same reference images as in the nose tutorial:
/tutorials/tutorial2/african_american_female.jpg
402        CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL
Eye-starter.obj ﬁle.
Female reference material.

CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL        403
Blocking in the upper eyelid.
Eye region anatomy.
Let’s quickly review the anatomy of the eye region. 
When creating an eye, a few landmarks you want to keep in mind:
  The boney border of the orbital cavity, particularly the prominence of the 
edge next to the nasal bone
  The ﬂeshy bulge of the Orbicular muscle, again on the inside edge of the 
orbital cavity below the eye.
We’ll start by blocking in the basic form of the upper eyelid. Focus on 
treating the lids very basically to start.
Procerus
Corrugator
Orbicularis Oculi 
Nasalis
Levator Labii
superioris alaeque

404        CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL
Next, add in the lower lid, again, very basically:
Now, referring to the model photos, rough in the tear duct as shown:
Blocking in the lower eyelid.
Model reference of tear duct.

CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL        405
Progress of tear duct.

406        CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL
Then create the ﬂesh pocket that lies over the top of the eye, making the 
outer-upper corner the high point:
Cavity above eye.
Model reference of 
ﬂesh pockets.
Keep in mind we’re roughing in form right now and there will be time to 
reﬁne proportions and position once the surrounding area is blocked in. 
You want to focus on big shapes ﬁrst.
Next, you are going to block in the area between the eye and the brow. 
The ﬁrst step is to ﬁll in the cavity above the eye as a ﬂat plane:

CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL        407
Next, you will address the cavity below the lower lid.
Start as in the last step by ﬁlling in the cavity with a ﬂat plane as shown:
Progress of model.
Filling in the cavity.

408        CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL
Next, create the ﬂeshy pocket between the lower eyelid and the 
edge of the orbital cavity. Pay particular attention to how it bulges 
on the side closest to the nose. Also, make sure you keep the 
inner edge of the orbital cavity clearly deﬁned as it is an important 
structural landmark:
Before ﬁnishing up, look closely at the photo reference. You want to 
be sure to position the tear duct vertically, properly in relation to the 
outer corner of the eye. You also will notice that the high point of 
the upper lid and the low point of the lower lid are slightly offset:
Model reference, ﬂeshy 
pocket below eye.
Model reference.
Evaluate progress.

CHAPTER 4: 3D TUTORIAL        409
Finally, take some time and evaluate the reference photographs and 
add or correct any forms you think are required. Pay attention to 
impacting forms, such as the subtle bulge of the ﬂeshy area above 
the eye impacting the upper eyelid. These types of details help in 
the realism of the ﬁnal sculpt.
In the end, you should wind up with something that looks similar to 
the images below.
Evaluate tear duct.

SCULPTING THE 
HUMAN HEAD
C H A P T E R  5 :
3 D  T U T O R I A L
In this tutorial it is time to put all the things that have been talked about 
together and sculpt an entire head. You will be sculpting one of our models, 
a Latino male. We chose this individual because he possesses exceptionally 
well deﬁned anatomical forms in his face.

448        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
Base mesh. 
Import the tutorial 4 base mesh into your sculpting application from the 
companion website:
/tutorials/tutorial4/starterhead.obj
Prepare the reference photography in the way you prefer (print outs, image 
planes, etc.). The images can be found:
/tutorials/tutorial4/tut_4_front.jpg
/tutorials/tutorial4/tut_4_angle_fr.jpg
/tutorials/tutorial4/tut_4_side.jpg
/tutorials/tutorial4/tut_4_angle_bk.jpg
The base mesh will approximately match the proportions of the model minus 
hair volume to give you a bit of a head start.
Next, block out the basic skull forms that you learned in the ﬁrst tutorial.

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        449
Generic skull form.
Step 1 goal.
Carefully evaluate where the bone landmarks fall based on the photo 
reference. You will want to wind up with something along the lines of 
the image below.

450        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
Upper lid.
Lower lid.
Looking at the reference photos, you are trying to take your best educated 
guess where the bone forms lie. You will be constantly referring back to the 
photos as you add and reﬁne the soft tissue, so don’t be too worried.
Next, you are going to begin to construct the eye region keeping to basics at 
ﬁrst. Follow along with the images below and your reference photography:

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        451
Above eye.
Below eye.

452        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
Lips part 1.
Lips part 2.
Nose forms.
Now you will focus on the mouth area. As before, follow along the steps 
pictured below and refer to the model reference photography.
Now move onto the basic geometric forms of the nose:

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        453
Evaluate progress.
Detail reduced in source 
photography using median 
ﬁlter.
From this point forward, you will be focusing on adding the more subtle 
details and attempting to capture the model’s likeness as much as possible. 
One good technique for capturing the next level of detail without getting too 
bogged down in the ﬁne details is to take a copy of the reference photos into 
Photoshop and use the median ﬁlter on them:
You’ll need to experiment with the value you set in the ﬁlter—its effect will 
vary based on the image resolution. What this does is simplify form and 
highlight shape so you can focus on the next level of detail while avoiding 
confusing high frequency detail too early. Other ﬁlters can probably provide 
a similar result; you just want to wind up with a slightly less detailed painterly 
version of your images.
Using the median ﬁltered source photos, start to reﬁne the ﬂeshy area below 
the eye, particularly the bulge of the orbicular muscle leading away from the 
tear duct.

454        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
Evaluate progress.
Lip reﬁnement.
Forehead region.
Now, working downward add the nasal labial fold. While you’re at it, examine 
the reference photography closely and you will notice the alaeque is visible 
on the surface of his face. Add that form as well:
Next, add the form of the nasal labial fold.
Continuing downward, add the next level of detail to the lips:
Now address the forehead region, blocking in the brow region and the 
frontal eminence:

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        455
Zygomatic jaw region.
Basic forms of ear.
 Reﬁning the ear.
Next, reﬁne the zygomatic and jaw region:
Now the basic forms of the ear:
And reﬁne:

456        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
 Basic hair form.
Reﬁne.
Before entering the ﬁnal level of reﬁnement, you should block in the hair 
form so that you can compare the overall proportions of your work to the 
reference photos.
At this point, assess your portrait for likeness and anatomic forms. Make any 
corrections you feel you need before proceeding.
Now we’ll walk through each region again and ﬁnalize the detail. In some 
steps the reﬁnements are subtle.
Starting with the eye, examine the tutorial images (left is before reﬁnement, 
right after) below as well as your source photos to soften any forms that are 
too strong as well as adding the next level of reﬁnement.

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        457
Nose reﬁnement.
Mouth reﬁnement.
The nose:
The mouth:

458        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
Forehead reﬁnement.
Forehead reﬁnement.
The forehead:
The mouth:

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        459
Ear reﬁnement.
 Jaw reﬁnement.
The ear:
And ﬁnally, the jaw and chin region, paying attention to the ﬂesh under the 
jaw that softens the jawline:

460        CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL
Reﬁnement.

CHAPTER 5: 3D TUTORIAL        461
Final product.
With some additional reﬁnement and detail added to the hair and neck 
regions, hopefully you have something similar (or better!) than in the 
image above.
