Preface 
Reading this Book 
The primary purpose of this book is to provide you with a good knowledge of the 
standard application concept and functionality, enabling you to run business 
processes in Microsoft Dynamics AX. This book is primarily designed for end 
users, students, and consultants interested in learning how to use Dynamics AX. 
Going beyond the operations on the user interface, you will learn how the different 
parts of the application work together. As a result, you will also take advantage 
from learning the end-to-end application concept if you are a system 
administrator, developer, IT executive, or experienced consultant not knowing the 
complete application already. 
Actually working in an application is the best way to learn it. This book therefore 
includes exercises building up on each other in a comprehensive case study. If you 
need support with the exercises, a free download of sample solutions is available. 
Dynamics AX is a very comprehensive business solution, making it impossible to 
cover all parts of the application in a single book. In order to provide a profound 
understanding of the core application, this book addresses the primary 
functionality in supply chain (including trade and logistics, and production 
control) and in finance management. It shows the application, but does not cover 
tasks in system administration and development. 
Microsoft Dynamics AX Version 
This book is based on Microsoft Dynamics AX released in March 2016 and updated 
in May 2016. It is an update of my previous book editions on Dynamics AX 2012. 
Microsoft Dynamics AX in the current release officially hasn’t got a version 
number, it is just called “Microsoft Dynamics AX” without version. The internal 
build version of this release is 7.0. Since the label “Dynamics AX” does not always 
make clear if an instruction refers to the latest release or generally applies to all 
releases, descriptions in this book use the name ‘AX 7’ when pointing out specific 
items of the latest release. 
Applicable Settings 
In Dynamics AX, you can individually choose the language of your user interface. 
Descriptions and illustrations in this book refer to the language “EN-US” (United 
States English). Whereas it is obvious that the Dynamics AX client displays 
different labels when choosing languages like Spanish or Russian, there are also 
www.allitebooks.com

VI 
Preface 
differences when selecting British English. For example, the label for the field 
“Sales tax” is “VAT” in British English. Other differences between your application 
and the descriptions in the book are possibly caused by permission settings, by 
local features, or by specific modifications and features in your application. 
In order to benefit from the explanations, it is recommended to access a working 
environment of Dynamics AX. A separate test application, where you can execute 
the exercises, is required to avoid an impact on actual company data. 
For the screenshots in this book, the color theme “High contrast” and a small 
element size has been selected in the visual preferences of the user options. The 
illustrations refer to a sample company “Anso Technologies Ltd.”, which includes 
a simple setup limited to the described functionality. In order to grant a flexible 
choice of the training environment, the tasks in the exercises are specified in a way 
that you can use the Microsoft standard demo environment (“Contoso 
Entertainment System USA”) or any other test environment.

What is Microsoft Dynamics AX? 
Dynamics AX is Microsoft’s core business management solution, designed to meet 
the requirements of mid-sized companies and multinational organizations. Based 
on a state-of-the-art architecture, Dynamics AX shows comprehensive functionality 
while ensuring high usability at the same time. 
The latest version Dynamics ‘AX 7’ (officially labeled as “Dynamics AX” without 
version name) introduces fundamental changes in the system architecture. It is a 
cloud-based application deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform. An on-premise 
deployment on customer infrastructure will be available in a later update. 
Replacing the former Windows client, the new browser-based client supports most 
operating systems and browsers. 
1.1 
Axapta and the History of Dynamics AX 
Dynamics AX has originally been developed under the name Axapta by Damgaard 
A/S, a Danish software company. Prior to the launch of Damgaard, the founders – 
Erik and Preben Damgaard – have already been co-founders of PC&C, the 
company which has developed Navision (now Dynamics NAV). 
The first official version of Axapta, version 1.0, has been released in March 1998 for 
Denmark and the USA. Version 1.5, published in October 1998, has added country-
specific functionality for several European countries. With the release of version 2.0 
in July 1999 and version 3.0 in October 2002, Axapta has been introduced in 
multiple additional countries while including functional enhancements in many 
areas of the application. 
After signing a merger agreement in November 2000, Damgaard A/S united with 
the local rival Navision A/S, a successor of PC&C. Microsoft subsequently acquired 
Navision-Damgaard in May 2002 and accepted the main products of this company, 
Navision and Axapta, as the core business solutions in the portfolio of Microsoft. 
Whereas Dynamics NAV (Navision) with its functionality and technology is a 
solution for small companies, Dynamics AX (Axapta) is the product for mid-sized 
and large companies. 
Microsoft rebranded Axapta to Dynamics AX when releasing version 4.0 in June 
2006. Apart from functional enhancements, Dynamics AX 4.0 introduced a 
redesigned user interface which provided a Microsoft Office-like look and feel. 
Dynamics AX 2009, which included role centers, workflow functionality, and an 
updated user interface as core improvements, has been published in June 2008. 
Dynamics AX 2009 also provided enhanced functionality, including the multisite

foundation and additional modules ensuring an end-to-end support for the supply 
chain requirements of global organizations. 
Dynamics AX 2012, which has been published in August 2011, has shown a further 
updated user interface with list pages and action panes across the whole 
application. Role-based security, the accounting framework with segmented 
account structures, the enhanced use of shared data structures, and other features 
have facilitated collaboration across legal entities and operating units within the 
application, and as a result have provided additional support for large 
multinational enterprises. Updated versions of Dynamics AX 2012 have been 
released later – the Feature Pack in February 2012 (adding industry features for 
retail and process manufacturing), R2 in December 2012 (adding data partitions, 
additional country features, and Windows 8 support), and R3 in May 2014 (adding 
the advanced warehouse and transportation management solution). 
Microsoft Dynamics ‘AX 7’ has been published in March 2016 with a first update, 
primarily containing technical improvements, in May 2016. Whereas this version 
does not contain a multitude of functional updates if compared to Dynamics 
AX 2012 R3, it shows a completely new cloud-based application platform and user

Dynamics AX Product Overview 
Microsoft Dynamics AX is an adaptable business management solution, which is 
easy to use and nevertheless supports the complex requirements of multinational 
companies. 
When accessing Dynamics AX for the first time, most people feel comfortable from 
the very beginning because its intuitive user interface. This user experience helps 
to start working in Dynamics AX easily and efficiently, supported by a tight 
integration to other Microsoft cloud services. Dashboards, which are the start page 
when opening Dynamics AX, grant an easy and fast access to all required areas. 
1.2.1 
Functional Capabilities 
An end-to-end support of business processes across the whole organization 
enables the integration of organization units (like companies and departments) and 
of business partners (like customers and vendors). 
Multi-language, multi-country, and multi-currency capabilities, the organization 
model for managing multiple hierarchies of operating units and legal entities, and 
the option to manage multiple sites within one legal entity provide the option to 
manage complex global organizations within a common database. 
The functional capabilities of Dynamics AX include following main areas: 
 Sales and marketing 
 Supply chain management 

1.2  Dynamics AX Product Overview 
3 
 Production 
 Procurement and sourcing 
 Service management 
 Financial management 
 Project management and accounting 
 Human capital management 
 Business intelligence and reporting 
In addition to the core ERP solution, industry-specific functionality for 
manufacturing, distribution, retail, services, and the public sector, which are 
included in the standard application, provides a broad industry foundation. 
Local features are available in order to comply with country-specific requirements. 
By default, applicable local features are controlled by the country/region of the 
primary address of the company (legal entity). 
In order to support data analysis, the integrated reporting features and the option 
to embed business intelligence reports and visualizations grant a fast and reliable 
presentation of business data. Business intelligence features are not only available 
to users in finance administration, but also for users in all other areas of 
Dynamics AX who need to analyze their data. 
1.2.2 
Implementation 
In the current release, Microsoft Dynamics AX is only available as cloud-based 
solution on Microsoft Azure. A later update will support on-premise deployments. 
Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services, which are a Microsoft Azure-based portal 
solution including a collaborative environment and continuously updated services 
for managing the Dynamics AX deployment, are the starting point for a 
Dynamics AX implementation. 
Microsoft usually does not sell Dynamics AX directly to customers, but offers an 
indirect sales channel. Customers purchase licenses from certified partners, who 
offer their services to support the implementation of Dynamics AX. This support 
includes application consulting, system setup, and the development of 
enhancements and functional modifications. 
Additional resources including Dynamics AX product information, customer 
stories and online demos are available on the global Microsoft Dynamics AX web 
page http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/erp-ax-overview.aspx and on a local 
web page accessible through the Microsoft homepage of your country. 
1.2.3 
Data Structure 
When using Dynamics AX (or any other business software), you are working with 
data which describe transactions (e.g. item transactions). As a prerequisite for these 
transactions, you need to manage data which describe objects (e.g. customers). 
Including the data specifying the configuration, there are three types of data: 

4 
1  What is Microsoft Dynamics AX? 
 Setup data 
 Master data 
 Transaction data 
Setup data determine the way business processes work in Dynamics AX. You can, 
for example, choose in the setup whether to apply warehouse locations or serial 
numbers. Apart from modifying programmable objects, setup is the second way to 
adapt the application according to the requirements of an enterprise. Setup data 
are entered when initially setting up the system. Later modifications of core setup 
data need to be checked carefully. 
Master data describe objects like customers, main accounts, or products. They do 
not change periodically, but at the time related objects change – for example when 
a customer changes the delivery address. Master data are entered or imported 
initially before a company starts working in the application. Depending on the 
business, you have to update master data only occasionally later on. 
Transaction data are continuously updated when processing business activities. 
Examples for transaction data are sales orders, invoices, or item transactions. 
Dynamics AX generates transaction data with every business activity. Registering 
and posting of transaction data complies with the voucher principle. 
1.2.4 
Voucher Principle 
If you want to post a transaction, you have to start by registering a voucher with a 
header and one or more lines. Every voucher is processed in two steps: 
 Registration – Entering the voucher (creating the initial document) 
 Posting – Posting the voucher (creating the posted document) 
Vouchers are based on master data like main accounts, customers or products. It is 
not possible to post a voucher as long as it does not comply with the rules defined 
by setup data and the Dynamics AX-internal business logic (e.g. enforcing that an 
item transaction has to include a serial number if serial number control is active). 
Once a voucher is posted, it is not possible to change it any more.  
Examples for vouchers in Dynamics AX are orders in sales and in purchasing, or 
journals in finance and in inventory management. After posting, the posted 
documents are packing slips, invoices, ledger transactions, or inventory 
transactions. 
Note: Some minor vouchers like quarantine orders show an exception regarding 
the voucher structure – they do not consist of a header and separate lines.

Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
One of the core principles of Microsoft Dynamics AX is to grant an intuitive and 
smooth user experience. But business software has to be in line with business 
processes, which may be quite complex. 
2.1 
User Interface and Common Tasks 
Before we start to go through business processes and case studies, we want to take 
a look at the general functionality in this chapter. 
2.1.1 
Logon and Authentication 
Microsoft Dynamics AX in version 7.0 is a cloud-based solution, requiring to logon 
with a Microsoft Azure Active Directory user account (Microsoft Office 365 
account). In order to log on, open a supported web browser like the Internet 
Explorer or Google Chrome and access the web address (URL) of your 
Dynamics AX application. The browser then shows the logon dialog, where you 
have to enter your Azure Active Directory user and password. 
After logging on, the user-ID in Dynamics AX, the current company (legal entity), 
and the language derive from your user options, which you can change within the 
client. 
Parameters in the web address of the Dynamics AX application can override the 
user 
settings 
and 
provide 
additional 
options. 
The 
web 
address 
https://XXX.com/?&cmp=FRSI&lng=fr (XXX.com = Dynamics AX URL) for example 
provides access to the company “FRSI” in French language. 
If you want to log off from Dynamics AX, click the user name (or the button 
) on 
the right-hand side of the Dynamics AX navigation bar and select Sign out. 
2.1.2 
Navigation 
There are four ways to access pages and forms in Microsoft Dynamics AX: 
 Dashboard and workspaces 
 Navigation pane 
 Navigation search 
 Favorites 
The Dynamics AX dashboard (see section 2.1.3) is the default initial page when 
accessing Microsoft Dynamics AX. Since it contains all workspaces which are 
available to the current user, you can use the dashboard for navigating to 
workspaces. From the workspaces you can subsequently access list pages and 
detail forms.

2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
2.1.2.1 Navigation Pane 
Whereas workspaces and favorites contain a limited number of menu items for 
frequent use, the navigation pane provides access to all items for which you have 
got appropriate permissions. 
In order to show the complete navigation pane, press the keyboard shortcut Alt+F1 
or click the button 
 (Navigation pane) on the left-hand side of the Dynamics AX 
client. If all modules and menu items are shown, the Dynamics AX navigation 
pane includes following elements (see Figure 2-1): 
 Navigation bar [1] 
 Navigation pane [2] 
 Favorites [3] 
 Recent [4] 
 Workspaces [5] 
 Modules [6] 
 Menu for the selected module [7] 
If you want to show the navigation pane permanently, click the button 
 (Pin) on 
the top right-hand side of the navigation pane. In case you want to collapse the 
navigation pane after pinning it open, click the button 
 (Collapse) then shown on 
the top right-hand side of the navigation pane. 
 
Figure 2-1: 
Navigation pane and menu in Dynamics AX 
2.1.2.2 Modules and Menu Structure 
The structure of the modules complies with functional areas like Accounts payable 
or Production control and refers to standard roles in the industry. The modules 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
7 
Organization administration and System administration include basic settings and 
tasks which are not related to a specific functional area. 
The Common module contains menu items not related to a functional role, but 
relevant for all users. This includes the Global address book (see section 2.4), the Work 
items (workflow management, see section 10.4.2), the Cases (see section 10.5.2), the 
Activities (referring to sales and marketing), and the Document management (see 
section 10.5.1). 
After selecting a module, the menu shows all accessible menu items of this 
module. The particular folders and menu items, which are depending on the 
individual module, comply with a common basic structure. 
The first folder in the menu is the folder Workspaces, containing all workspaces 
related to the selected module. This folder is not shown if the selected module does 
not include a workspace. Below the workspaces, there are several folders and 
menu items providing access to pages for frequent tasks in the particular module 
(e.g. the vendor management in the Accounts payable module). 
The folder Inquiries and reports contains items for reporting and analysis. Inquires 
show the result directly on the screen, whereas reports generate a printout on 
paper. If you do not need a printed hard copy, you can select to display a print 
preview or to save the report to a file. 
The folder Periodic tasks contains items, which are not used frequently – for 
example the menu items for month end closing or summary updates. 
Depending on the module, one or more Setup folders provide access to 
configuration data of the particular module. Configuration data are entered when 
initially setting up a company (legal entity). Later on, configuration data are only 
updated if necessary because of changes in the business processes. Some settings 
should not be changed without a deep knowledge of the Dynamics AX 
functionality. For this reason, the permissions for the Setup folders usually are set 
in a way that regular users cannot edit sensible configuration data. 
2.1.2.3 Recent Pages 
The folder Recent in the navigation pane shows the last workspaces and pages 
which you have visited. Dynamics AX automatically adds menu items to this 
folder from your browsing history, which makes it easy to go back to a form 
recently visited. 
2.1.2.4 Navigation Search 
The navigation search provides the option to directly access menu items by typing 
part of the name (similar to the search feature in Windows 8/10). 
In order to use the navigation search, click the button 
 (Search) in the navigation 
bar and enter the page title or navigation path in the search field. You can limit the 
entered text to the first characters of the words of a page title or navigation path. 

8 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
For example, typing “al pu” in the navigation search shows the page All purchase 
orders as first result. Selecting a menu item in the navigation search results will 
open the related page. 
 
Figure 2-2: 
Using the navigation search 
2.1.2.5 Favorites and Shared Links 
Whereas modules and related menu items in the navigation pane show a uniform 
structure, the Dynamics AX favorites provide the option to collect menu items 
according to your particular requirements. 
If you want to add a workspace or a page to your Dynamics AX favorites, open the 
navigation pane to show the particular menu item and click the empty star 
 on 
the right of the menu item. A full star 
 on the right of the menu item then 
indicates that it is included in the favorites. 
Once a menu item is added to the favorites, it automatically shows in the favorites 
area at the top of the navigation pane. If you want to remove an item from the 
favorites, click the star 
 on the right of the menu item in the favorites pane. 
 
Figure 2-3: 
Managing favorites in Dynamics AX 
Apart from the favorites within Dynamics AX, you can use shared links to access 
Dynamics AX forms. In every list page or form, there is the button 
OPTIONS/Share/Get a link in the action pane. A dialog then shows the web address 
of the current form, which you can copy and send to other users of your 
Dynamics AX application. Of course you can also use this link together with 
general features of your browser and add it to the browser favorites or the browser 
start page tiles. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
9 
2.1.2.6 Switching the Current Company 
If you want to switch from one legal entity to another, open the lookup for 
switching companies by clicking the company field in the navigation bar. After 
selecting a company in the lookup, Dynamics AX immediately switches to the 
other company. 
 
Figure 2-4: 
Switching the current company 
2.1.2.7 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
With the browser-based interface replacing the Windows client, there are 
completely new options for navigating Dynamics AX. Apart from minor 
modifications in the menu structure, which eliminate the rigid structure of the 
Common and the Setup folder in various modules, core changes include the 
dashboard (replacing the role center), the workspaces, and the navigation search. 
There is no Dynamics AX address bar, but you can use the address bar of your 
browser. The favorites now do not support creating a personal menu structure. 
2.1.3 
Elements of the User Interface 
Microsoft Dynamics AX contains following types of standard pages: 
 Dashboard 
 Workspaces 
 List pages 
 Detail and transaction forms 
 Journals, inquiries and setup forms 
This section explains the elements available in these pages. 
2.1.3.1 Dashboard 
As start page in Dynamics AX, the dashboard displays all your workspaces to give 
an overview of the work you should do by. Clicking a workspace tile, e.g. Budget 
planning in Figure 2-5, provides access to the related workspace. 
The default dashboard contains following areas (compare Figure 2-5): 
 Navigation bar [1] – Described below 
 Company banner [2] – As specified in the company setup (see section 10.1.4) 
 Navigation pane [3] – Collapsed in Figure 2-5 
 Calendar and Work items [4] 
 Workspaces [5] 
The calendar in the dashboard highlights the Session date, which is used as default 
value for the posting date in the current session. The initial value for the session 
date is the current date, but through the dashboard calendar (or the menu item 

10 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
Common> Common> Session date and time) you can temporarily set it to a different 
date. 
The work items pane below the calendar in the dashboard refers to the workflow 
management (see section 10.4.2). 
 
Figure 2-5: 
Dynamics AX dashboard 
When working in a workspace or a form, you can always return to the dashboard 
(initial page) by clicking the button 
 on the left side of the navigation bar. 
Note: In your user options, you can select to use an alternative page (e.g. the 
employee self-service portal) as initial page instead of the dashboard. 
2.1.3.2 Navigation Bar 
The navigation bar at the top of every Dynamics AX form contains following 
buttons for global Dynamics AX features (see Figure 2-6): 
 Go to dashboard [1] – Return to the initial page 
 Navigation search [2] – See section 2.1.2 
 Company select [3] – See section 2.1.2 
 Show messages [4] – See section 2.1.4 
 Settings [5] – User options and other general settings 
 Help [6] – See section 2.1.6 
 Feedback [7] 
 User [8] – For signing out 
Apart from the User options (see section 2.3.1), the options in the button 
 (Settings) 
include the Task recorder (see section 10.5.3) and the Dynamics AX product 
information (button About). 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
11 
 
Figure 2-6: 
Navigation bar in Dynamics AX 
2.1.3.3 Workspaces 
Workspaces are designed as starting point for the daily work in Dynamics AX. 
They are pages which collect all the information and functionality required to 
perform a specific job. The workspace Purchase order receipt and follow-up (see 
Figure 2-7) for example shows a list of delayed receipts in the center. In addition, it 
provides access and indicates the number of not invoiced orders, and it includes 
other data areas through tiles on the right and on the left. 
 
Figure 2-7: 
Workspace for purchase order receipt and follow-up 
You can view and access all workspaces, for which you have got appropriate 
permissions, from the dashboard and from the navigation pane. The workspace 
panorama then contains the following panes (compare Figure 2-7): 
 Summary pane [1] 
 Tabbed list pane [2] 
 Optional further panes [3]  
 Related links [4] 
The tabbed list pane [2] in the center of a workspace is the main place for the daily 
work. After selecting a list in the left area [5] of this pane, the grid in the right [6] 
displays the related list of records. The filter field above the grid provides the 
option to apply a record filter. Clicking a key field shown as link in the grid 
immediately opens the related detail form. Depending on the particular 
workspace, there are buttons for executing actions in the action pane [7] and – if 
applicable – in the toolbar above the grid in the tabbed list pane. 

12 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
The summary pane [1] on the left-hand side contains tiles for starting new tasks or 
accessing pages which are important in connection with the selected workspace 
(e.g. purchase orders in Figure 2-7). Tiles in this pane – like tiles in general – are 
rectangular buttons which open pages (like a menu item button) and optionally 
show data like counts or key performance indicators. 
Depending on the particular workspace, there are further panes [3] to the right of 
the tabbed list pane, which contain tiles, charts, or graphs. The right-most pane [4] 
in the workspace contains links to pages which are related to the selected 
workspace. 
2.1.3.4 List Page 
A list page, like the customer page in Figure 2-8, shows the list of records of a 
particular table. While list pages are primarily designed for viewing and selecting 
records, buttons in the action pane provide the option to execute tasks on these 
records immediately. 
 
Figure 2-8: 
Customer list page as an example of a list page 
List pages have a common structure, containing different elements and features 
depending on the data shown in the particular page. The common structure 
includes following basic elements: 
 Action pane [1] – Contains the action buttons 
 View/Edit mode banner [2] – Displays in view mode, indicating that editing 
data is not possible in this mode 
 Filter options [3] – Filter button and quick filter field (see section 2.1.5) 
 Grid [4] – Displays the list of records 
 Grid check boxes [5] – Enable selecting multiple or – if selecting the checkbox 
in the header line – all records 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
13 
 Scroll bar [6] – Scroll through records or press the shortcut keys PgUp, PgDn, 
Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End 
 FactBoxes [7] – Show a summary of additional information related to the 
selected record (e.g. the primary address of the selected customer) 
Clicking the button Edit in the action pane changes the page mode to edit mode, 
which gives the option to immediately update record data. 
If the full action pane is displayed and you need additional space, you can collapse 
it by clicking the button 
 (Collapse) on the bottom right of the action pane. Once 
collapsed, the action pane will expand automatically when clicking an action pane 
tab (e.g. CUSTOMER in Figure 2-8). In order to show the full action pane 
permanently, click the button 
 (Pin open) on the bottom right of the action pane 
when expanded. 
If a page does not show the FactBoxes pane and you want to view it, click the 
button 
 (Show) top right of the grid. By clicking the button 
 (Hide) at the same 
place you can hide the FactBoxes again. A general setting for activating or 
deactivating the FactBoxes pane is available in the system administration (System 
administration> Setup> Client performance options). 
List pages do not automatically refresh, if data displayed on the screen change in 
the database (e.g. if somebody is working on the records displayed in the list). In 
order to refresh a list page, press the keyboard shortcut Shift+F5 or click the button 
 (Refresh) in the action pane (or use the refresh options of your browser). 
2.1.3.5 Action Pane and Action Search 
The action pane contains buttons for activities referring to the selected record (like 
entering the order of a customer) and buttons for access to related detail forms 
(displaying more information). The number and functionality of buttons, which 
can show on show on multiple tabs (e.g. the action pane tabs CUSTOMER or SELL 
in Figure 2-8), is depending on the particular page. If the window size does not 
allow to show all action pane tabs, the button 
 provides access to the tabs not 
shown immediately. 
On the top right of the action pane, there are buttons for general options including 
Open in Microsoft Office 
 (see section 2.2.2), Attach 
 (document handling, see 
section 10.5.1), Refresh 
 , Open in new window 
 (described later in the current 
section), and Close 
. 
The action search provides the option to directly access buttons in the action pane 
by typing part of the name. In order to use the action search, click the button 
 
(Search) in the action pane (or press the shortcut key Alt+Q) and enter the action 
title or action pane button path in the search field. Like in the navigation search, 
you can limit the entered text to the first characters of the words of the name. As an 
example for using the action search, you can quickly access the customer balance 

14 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
from the customer list page by pressing the shortcut key Alt+Q, typing “b”, and 
pressing the Enter key. 
2.1.3.6 Detail Form for Master Data 
Unlike list pages, which are designed for viewing a list of records, detail forms are 
there for inserting and modifying individual records. 
Clicking a key field shown as link in the grid of a list page (or pressing the Enter 
key when the field is active) opens the related detail form. Alternatively, you can 
access a detail form by clicking the button Page options/Change view/Details view on 
tab OPTIONS in the action pane of a list page. 
 
Figure 2-9: 
Elements of a detail form on the example of the customer detail form 
Detail forms have got a structure which is similar to list pages, and like in list 
pages the specific elements and functions are depending on the particular form. 
Figure 2-9 shows the customer detail form (accessed from the list page Accounts 
receivable> Customers> All customers) as example for the structure of detail forms. 
The common structure of detail forms includes the following basic elements: 
 Action pane [1] – Collapsed in Figure 2-9. 
 View/Edit mode banner [2] – Indicates whether you are in view mode 
 Filter button and List button [3] – Open a pane for entering a filter and/or 
displaying a list of records 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
15 
 Fast tabs [4] – Group fields according to their functional area and show 
summary fields, which display core data directly on the tab. In Figure 2-9, the 
fast tab Invoice and delivery for example shows the terms of payment “N30”. You 
can expand fast tabs by clicking the particular tab. A right-hand click on a tab 
provides the option to expand or collapse all tabs at the same time. 
 FactBoxes [5] – Show additional information (like in a list page) 
The button 
 (Show/Hide list) [3] provides the option to view a list of records in 
detail forms. After clicking this button in a detail form, Dynamics AX displays a 
navigation list pane on the left-hand side of the form. Selecting a record in the 
navigation list immediately shows the related detail data, which makes it easy to 
move from one record to the next. 
Section 2.1.4 later in this book contains more information on editing records, 
working with fast tabs, and other options available in list pages and detail forms. 
In order to return from a detail form to the list page, use the Back button of your 
browser, or press the shortcut Alt+Back Arrow (or the Esc key), or click the button 
 (Close) in the action pane. 
2.1.3.7 Detail Form for Transaction Data 
In addition to the detail forms for master data as described above, Dynamics AX 
contains detail forms for transaction data (like the sales order form in Figure 2-10). 
 
Figure 2-10: Sales order form as example of a transaction detail form 
Clicking a key field shown as link in the grid of the particular list page (e.g. the 
sales order list page Sales and marketing> Sales orders> All sales orders) opens the 
transaction detail form similar to opening a master data detail form from a list 

16 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
page as described above. When accessing a transaction detail form, it shows the 
Lines view where you can view or edit the lines. 
In the toolbar [3] of the tab Lines, there are buttons for executing actions on the 
selected line – for example deleting a line by clicking the button Remove. The action 
pane [1] at the top of the form provides the option to execute actions at header 
level – for example deleting a complete order by clicking the button Delete. 
If you want to edit details not shown in the line grid, expand the fast tab Line 
details [4]. In order to structure the field display, the line details tab contains 
multiple sub-tabs. 
The lines view shows basic header data in the tab Header. Clicking the button 
Header [2] below the action pane (or pressing the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+H) opens 
the header view, which contains all fields of the header record. In the header view, 
the button Lines below the action pane (shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+L) takes you back to 
the lines view. 
2.1.3.8 Inquiries and Setup Forms 
In comparison to detail forms, inquiries and setup forms show a simple layout. 
Dynamics AX contains following simple forms: 
 Simple list – Plain grid without fast tabs, e.g. the customer groups (Accounts 
receivable> Setup> Customer groups). 
 Simple list and Details – Detail form always showing a navigation list pane 
with the list of records on the left, e.g. the terms of payment (Accounts receivable> 
Payment setup> Terms of payment). 
 Parameter form – Showing a table of contents (similar to the tab structure) on 
the left and related fields on the right, e.g. the accounts receivable parameters 
(Accounts receivable> Setup> Accounts receivable parameters). 
2.1.3.9 Connected Browser Windows 
Sometimes it is convenient to use connected windows in order to see related 
information side by side, for example if you want to scroll through the vendor 
transactions per vendor. 
In the example of vendor transactions, open the vendor list page (Accounts payable> 
Vendors> All vendors) and click the button VENDOR/Transactions/Transactions in the 
action pane. In the vendor transactions, click the button 
 (Open in new window) 
which will move the vendor transactions to a new browser window. This new 
browser window is dynamically linked to the main Dynamics AX browser 
window, which shows the previous form (the vendor list page in the example). 
Moving from one vendor to another in the main window then automatically 
updates the data shown in the new transaction window. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
17 
2.1.3.10 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Based on the design principles required for the browser-based user interface, the 
new release has a “flat” design. This means that all forms show in the main 
browser window (not opening a separate window per form like in AX 2012). 
Client forms now include the action search and the edit mode in list pages. The 
navigation list pane in detail forms replaces the AX 2012 grid view. There is no 
command bar, no preview pane, and no status bar. General options of the former 
command bar are now available in the navigation bar, form-specific features in the 
tab OPTIONS of the action pane. Cues in AX 2012 role centers are replaced by tiles 
in workspaces. 
2.1.4 
Working with Records 
Microsoft Dynamics AX supports working with the mouse, but also offers 
extensive support for keyboard usage. Apart from shortcut keys, the navigation 
search and the action search enable fast data entry without using the mouse. An 
overview of shortcut keys for executing basic operations in Dynamics AX is 
included in the appendix of this book. 
2.1.4.1 Viewing Records 
When accessing a menu item from the navigation pane or through a tile in a 
workspace, Dynamics AX shows the appropriate list page. 
List pages are the starting point for working on items, giving you the possibility to 
search and filter records. Buttons in the action pane of the list page provide the 
option to edit, delete, and insert data according to your permissions. 
Whereas a list page only contains a limited number of fields, the detail form shows 
all available fields of the record. In order to access the detail form after selecting a 
line in the list page, click the key field shown as link in the grid. 
Fast tabs on detail forms expand by clicking them or by pressing the Enter key. If 
you want to collapse an individual tab, click the tab header again or press the 
shortcut key Alt+0. Further options are available through a right-hand click on a 
tab. If you select to expand all tabs, you can scroll through the complete record 
(e.g. with your mouse wheel). Some tabs contain less important fields, which are 
not shown immediately when expanding the tab. The link Show more fields in such 
tabs provides the option to show these fields. 
2.1.4.2 Edit/View Mode 
When accessing a list page, it always opens in view mode which prevents data to 
be changed unintentionally. Detail forms usually also open in view mode, but this 
is depending on the settings of the form. In view mode, a banner below the action 
pane indicates that editing data is not possible.

2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
If you are in view mode and want to edit a record, switch to the edit mode by 
clicking the button Edit in the action pane or by pressing the F2 key. If you already 
change to the edit mode in a list page and access the related detail form afterwards, 
the detail form will open in edit mode. In order to return to the view mode, press 
the F2 key again or click the button OPTIONS/Edit/Read mode in the action pane. 
If you want to start a particular form always in edit mode, click the button 
OPTIONS/Personalize/Always open for editing in the action pane of the form. In case 
you want to set your general default mode to Edit or View, choose the appropriate 
setting on the tab Preferences of your user options. 
2.1.4.3 Inserting Records 
In order to insert a record in a list page or a detail form, press the shortcut key 
Alt+N or click the button New in the action pane. In some workspaces, you can also 
create records (there is an appropriate button in the action pane in this case). 
A Quick create dialog (see Figure 2-11) then shows on the right-hand side of the 
form. This dialog contains the core fields of the record, making it possible to insert 
records in a fast way. After clicking the button Save at the bottom of the dialog, 
Dynamics AX opens to the related detail form where you can enter additional data. 
Depending on the page, the Save and open button contains additional options – e.g. 
for switching to the sales quotation form immediately when creating a customer. 
 
Figure 2-11: Quick create dialog for entering a new customer 
If no Quick create dialog is available for a particular page, Dynamics AX takes you 
to the related detail form showing an empty record for entering data (except if you 
apply a template as described in section 2.3.2). 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
19 
In the lines of a transaction form (e.g. the sales order lines), you can create a new 
record by simply pressing the Down Arrow key from the last line of the grid. 
2.1.4.4 Editing Data 
Before you can edit a record in a list page or detail form, you have to make sure 
that you are in the edit mode. In order to switch between the fields of the form, you 
can use the mouse, the Tab key, or the Shift+Tab shortcut key. 
If you have started to insert a record which contains a mandatory field and you 
want to stop, you might have to delete the record as described below even if you 
did not enter anything. Alternatively, you can close the form without saving by 
pushing the Esc key. If you are in a Quick create dialog, click the button Cancel at the 
bottom. 
You can manually save a record in list pages and detail forms by clicking the 
button Save in the action pane or by pressing the shortcut key Alt+S (or Ctrl+S). But 
it is not required to save a record explicitly. Dynamics AX saves every change of a 
record automatically when leaving the record – switching to another record, or 
closing the form using the Back button of the browser, or the button 
 (Close) in 
the action pane of the form. If you close a form pressing the Esc key, a dialog asks 
whether you want to save the changes. 
If you have entered or modified data and do not want to save the update, press the 
shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+F5 or click the button OPTIONS/Edit/Revert in the action 
pane. Reversing restores the record from the database and is only available as long 
as you do not save the record (manually or by moving to another record). 
Another option not to save changes is to close the form by pressing the Esc key or 
the shortcut key Alt+Shift+Q (as long as you did not save the record already). 
2.1.4.5 Deleting Data 
In order to delete the content of an input field, press the Delete key. If you want to 
delete a complete record, click the button Delete in the action pane or press the 
shortcut key Alt+F9 after selecting the particular record. 
In some cases, Dynamics AX shows an error message preventing you from deleting 
a record – e.g. if there are open transactions. 
2.1.4.6 Elements in a Detail Form 
When entering data in a form, you have to distinguish between following elements 
as shown in Figure 2-12 on the example of the bank accounts detail form (Cash and 
bank management> Bank accounts): 
 Field group [1] – Groups fields by functional area to provide a logical structure. 
 Mandatory field [2] – Shows a red frame and the required field indicator 
, 
requiring data input before you can save the record. 

20 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
 Slider [3] – Sliders (as shown in Figure 2-12) and checkboxes are used in fields 
with a binary choice (Yes/No). In order to select a checkbox or set a slider to 
“Yes”, click it with the mouse or press the Space bar key once the cursor is on the 
field. 
 Date field [4] – The format of date and number fields is specified on the tab 
Preferences of your user options. Date fields show the calendar icon 
 for 
selecting a particular date. If entering a date manually, you don’t have to type 
date separators like “.” or “/”. For a date in the current year, simply enter the 
day and month (e.g. “0523” if using the US date format). In order to insert the 
current date, simply type “t” (or “d” for the session date). 
 Lookup field with a fixed list of values [5] 
 Lookup field with a related main table [6] 
 
Figure 2-12: Types of fields on the example of the bank account detail form 
2.1.4.7 Lookup Fields and Table Reference 
In a lookup field, you can only enter or select a value which is included in a 
predefined list of values. Related to the setup of this list of values, there are two 
types of lookup fields: 
 Lookup fields with a related main table, which contains permitted values – 
e.g. Bank groups in Figure 2-12. 
 Lookup fields with a fixed list of values, which is given by Dynamics AX 
enumerable types (Enums) – e.g. Bank account status in Figure 2-12. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
21 
In edit mode, all lookup fields show the lookup button 
 in the right part of the 
field. In view mode, lookup fields with a related main table show as a link (similar 
to Internet links). 
When typing characters in a lookup field, the value lookup opens automatically 
and applies the typed characters as filter on the ID (key field of the relevant table). 
In many lookups, the filter also applies to the column Name. If you enter for 
example “E” in a lookup field, the lookup form automatically pops up showing all 
records starting with “E” in the key field or the name. 
If you want to manually open a value lookup, click the lookup button 
 or press 
the shortcut key Alt + Down once the cursor is on the field. 
In the lookup form, you can select a record by clicking it, or by pressing the Enter 
key once the appropriate line in the lookup is active. If a value lookup contains 
multiple lines and you want to reduce the number of displayed lines, you can use 
the grid column filter and the sorting options as described in section 2.1.5. In the 
example shown in Figure 2-12, you can enter a filter on the bank group name by 
clicking the column header field Name in the lookup. 
Apart from value lookup, the table reference of fields with a related main table also 
provides the option to directly access the detail form of the related main table. If 
you want to insert a new bank group in the form shown in Figure 2-12 for example, 
you can open the bank group form directly from the Bank group field. 
In edit mode, you have to do a right-click on the field label (and not on the field 
itself) to open the context menu, where you can choose the option View details to 
access the detail form related to a lookup field. 
In view mode or in non-editable fields, the table reference displays as a link 
providing the option to access the related detail form with a simple mouse click 
(alternatively you can right-click the field label and select the View details option). 
After opening the referenced detail form, you can edit records the same way as if 
accessing from the navigation pane. Apart from using the table reference as an 
easy way to insert and edit related data, you can apply it to view the details of 
related records – for example directly accessing a sales order from a line in the 
invoice inquiry (Accounts receivable> Inquiries and reports> Invoices> Invoice journal). 
2.1.4.8 Product Information Dialog 
In some forms like the sales order or the purchase order form, selecting the option 
View details or clicking the link in the item number field does not show the item 
form (released product form), but the product information dialog. This dialog 
displays the core data of the item. In many cases, these data are sufficient and you 
don’t need to access the details in the released product form. But if you need, click 
the link in the field Item number of the dialog to access to released product detail 
form. 

22 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
2.1.4.9 Segmented Entry Control 
A special kind of lookup applies to ledger account fields, for example in the lines of 
financial journals. Since the ledger account is one field with multiple segments (the 
main account and applicable financial dimensions), a specific control for the 
lookup and data entry applies – the segmented entry control (see section 9.3.2). 
2.1.4.10 Message Bar and Message Center 
If there is an issue with the operation you are executing in Dynamics AX (e.g. if 
you try to delete a record which has got related transactions), an error message 
immediately displays in the message bar below the action pane of the form. 
If an asynchronous operation (e.g. document posting, or validation, or processing a 
batch job) generates an error or warning, the message is sent to the message center. 
The button 
 (Show messages) in the navigation bar then indicates the number of 
unread notifications. Clicking this button shows all recent messages, and for 
messages with extensive details (e.g. error messages when posting a document) 
you can click the link Message details to view more information (see Figure 2-13). 
 
Figure 2-13: Viewing notifications in the message center 
2.1.4.11 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The browser-based user interface has required changes in the form layout. There 
are new shortcuts, sliders replace most checkboxes, the value lookup opens 
automatically in lookup fields, and the message center replaces the Infolog. 
2.1.5 
Filtering and Sorting 
In order to work efficiently in tables that contain numerous records, it is crucial to 
find the records in demand quickly. Dynamics AX includes features for filtering 
and sorting in list pages and in detail forms for this purpose. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
23 
2.1.5.1 Quick Filter 
In list pages, the quick filter is the easiest way to filter records. When entering 
characters in the quick filter field, a drop dialog automatically displays where you 
can select on which column you want to apply the filter. 
 
Figure 2-14: Quick filter showing the drop dialog for the filter column 
After pressing the Enter key or clicking the search button 
 on the left-hand side 
of the quick filter field, the filter applies and the page only shows records which 
begin with the characters entered in the filter field. 
Figure 2-14 shows an example for entering a filter in the quick filter. The filter for 
customers with a name beginning with the characters “hy” is not yet executed. 
2.1.5.2 Filter Pane 
The filter pane, which is not only available in list pages but also in detail forms, 
provides the option to use multiple filter criteria in parallel. 
 
Figure 2-15: Filter pane in a list page 
In order to show the filter pane in a form, click the filter button 
 on the left-hand 
side or press the shortcut key Ctrl+F3. Then enter the required characters for 
filtering in the appropriate filter field of the filter pane. In the operator selection on 

24 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
the right side above the filter field, you can choose whether to apply these 
characters with a “begins with”, “contains”, “is one of”, or other operator. If you 
want to filter on additional or other fields, click the link Add a filter field in the filter 
pane and select the appropriate field. Clicking the button Apply finally applies the 
filter. 
The operator “matches” for a filter field provides the option to use manual 
wildcards and filter expressions as described further below. 
If you do not want to apply a selected filter any longer, clear it by clicking the 
button Reset in the filter pane. 
2.1.5.3 Grid Column Filter 
Another option for setting a filter in list pages and other list forms (including value 
lookups) is the grid column filter. 
 
Figure 2-16: Entering a grid column filter in a list page 
You can access the grid column filter by clicking the header field of a column in a 
grid. In the drop dialog, you can enter the filter in the filter field. The operator 
works the same way as described for the filter pane above. 
Once the grid column filter is active, you can see the filter icon 
 next to the 
particular column header. 
A special feature in the grid column filter is that you can use the asterisk (*) 
wildcard together with the “begins with” operator. This provides the option to 
enter for example “*ab” in the filter field for filtering on all records containing “ab” 
– without the need to change the operator. 
2.1.5.4 Advanced Filter 
If you have to enter complex filter criteria, you can access the advanced filter in list 
pages and in detail forms by pressing the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+F3 or by clicking 
the button OPTIONS/Page options/Advanced Filter/Sort in the action pane. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
25 
The advanced filter opens in a separate dialog on the right. Like the filter pane, the 
advanced filter provides the option to set a filter on fields which do not show in 
the list page or detail form. 
If you need to enter a criterion on a field which is not shown in the advanced filter 
dialog, insert a record in the filter dialog by pushing the shortcut Alt+N or clicking 
the button Add. In the new filter line, enter the criterion in the columns Table, 
Derived table, Field and Criteria. The fields Table and Derived table of a new line by 
default contain the base table of the filtered page. In case of simple criteria, you 
don’t have to change it. 
The lookup button 
 in the column Field opens a value lookup, where you can 
select the table field. In the column Criteria next to the column Field, enter the filter 
criterion. If the field selected in the filter line is a lookup field, you can open a 
value lookup. 
 
Figure 2-17: Entering filter criteria in the advanced filter dialog 
Once you have finished entering the filter criteria, close the advanced filter dialog 
by clicking the button OK. The filter then applies and the page only shows 
matching records. 
2.1.5.5 Filter Expressions 
When entering characters in the quick filter field of a list page, Dynamics AX 
shows records beginning with these characters. 
All other filter options support further filter criteria in order to provide more 
precise filtering definitions. The table below shows an overview of the most 
important filter expressions: 

26 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options

Field content containing “E” 
 
? 
?B* 
First character unknown, followed by a “B”, other 
characters unknown 
2.1.5.6 Saving a Filter 
If you need particular filter criteria frequently, you can save them by clicking the 
button Modify/Save as in the advanced filter dialog. A second dialog then requires 
entering a filter name. 
Saved filters are stored in your Usage data, which means that nobody else can use 
your saved filters. In order to select a saved filter, choose it in the lookup of the 
field Select query in the advanced filter dialog as shown in Figure 2-18. 
In addition to the filters saved manually, the filter which you have used the last 
time is available in every page by selecting the option Previously used query in the 
Select query lookup. 
 
Figure 2-18: Selecting a saved filter in the advanced filter dialog 
2.1.5.7 Sorting 
In addition to the filtering options, the grid column filter in list pages – accessible 
by clicking the appropriate column header – provides sorting options. If you open 
a detail form after sorting the list page, the detail form will use the sorting selected 
in the list page. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
27 
Alternatively, you can specify sorting criteria in the advanced filter dialog. The 
advanced filter dialog contains the tab Sorting for this purpose, where you can 
enter applicable sorting criteria with table name and field name in one or more 
lines (similar to a filter criterion). 
2.1.5.8 Distinguish Value Lookup 
When using a filter, you should not confuse it with the value lookup shown in 
section 2.1.4. Whereas the value lookup supports entering a value into a field, the 
filter features described here are used to select records from the table displayed in 
the grid. 
2.1.5.9 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The quick filter, the new filter pane, and the grid column filter in this release 
replace the filter by grid and the filter by selection in Dynamics AX 2012. 
2.1.6 
Help System 
If you need help on functional questions, you can access the Microsoft 
Dynamics AX Help system available throughout the whole application. In the help 
system, there are two areas of help content: 
 Wiki articles – Links to public Microsoft help text and videos 
 Task guides – From the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) 
Whereas task guides give a description on how to use Dynamics AX in business 
processes, the wiki articles explain standard features and functionality. 
 
Figure 2-19: Dynamics AX help referring to the customer form 

28 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
Basic parameters for the help system are specified in the system parameters 
(System administration> Setup> System parameters, tab Help). 
2.1.6.1 Accessing Help 
In order to access help, click the button 
 (Help) in the navigation bar. The help 
pane then displays task guides and wikis referring to the particular form (see 
Figure 2-19). After switching to the tab Wiki, you can access the help text by 
clicking the link to the particular Wiki article which opens in a new browser tab. 
The search field at the top of the help pane provides options which are similar to 
the features of search engines in the Internet. Abstracts in the search results help to 
recognize relevant text easily. 
In order to close the help pane, press the Esc key or click the button 
 (Close) on 
the top right of the help pane. 
2.1.6.2 Custom Help with Task Guides 
Using the task recorder (see section 10.5.3) you can create recordings based on the 
business processes in your company. After saving a recording to a Microsoft 
Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) Business Process Library, it will be available on 
the Task guides tab of the help pane. 
2.1.6.3 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The architecture of the help system has completely changed, containing links to 
Wikis and task guides instead of the help server. With the Dynamics AX May 2016 
update, you can view a short field help if pointing the mouse over a field label 
(similar to the AX 2012 help text in the status bar). 
2.1.7 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 2.1 – Logon and Navigation 
Your first task is to log on to a Dynamics AX training system, where you should 
access a company which is different from your default company. 
Open the list page All vendors, first through the Accounts payable menu in the 
navigation pane, and then through the navigation search. Check if there are 
vendors with a name starting with “A”. Next, access the workspace Purchase order 
preparation and try to find a vendor with a name starting with “A” from there. 
Finally, log out from the Dynamics AX. 
Exercise 2.2 – Favorites 
Start a client session in Dynamics AX, select the training company, and show the 
navigation pane. Add the list page Released products, which you can find in the 
menu Product information management, to your favorites. Then open this page from 
the favorites. 

2.1  User Interface and Common Tasks 
29 
Exercise 2.3 – Detail Forms 
As an example of detail forms in Dynamics AX, access the vendor detail form 
through the vendor list page (Accounts payable> Vendors> All vendors). In this form 
you want to view the vendor in the third line of the list page. Show an example of a 
field group and a lookup field with and without main table. 
Then show an example of a slider and a checkbox field. What can you tell about 
fast tabs and FactBoxes? How do you proceed if you want to edit the vendor? Is 
there an option to edit multiple vendors in this form? 
Exercise 2.4 – Inserting Records 
Create a new vendor without applying record templates. For the beginning, the 
only data for the vendor are the name “##-Exercise 2.4 Inc.” (## = your user ID) and 
any vendor group. 
Notes: If the number sequence for vendor accounts is set to “Manual”, you have to 
enter the vendor number manually. If the Accounts payable parameters require 
entering a sales tax group or a tax-exempt number (VAT registration number), 
access the tab Invoice and delivery and enter the required information there. 
Exercise 2.5 – Lookup Fields 
You want to update the vendor of exercise 2.4. Searching a Buyer group in the 
lookup of the appropriate field on the tab Miscellaneous details of the vendor form, 
you notice that the required group is not available. Create a new buyer group ##-P 
(## = your user ID) using the View details option. Then select the new group in your 
vendor record. 
Exercise 2.6 – Filtering 
In order to get some exercise with filtering, enter a few filters in the vendor list 
page as given below. Use the quick filter and the grid column filter for the first and 
the second filtering task. For the other filtering tasks, use the filter pane and the 
advanced filter. 
Use following criteria one after the other and clear the filter after each task: 
 All vendors with a name starting with “T” 
 All vendors assigned to the vendor group selected in exercise 2.4 
 All vendors with a name containing “in” 
 Vendors with a number from US-101 to US-103 or higher than US-108 
 
(use a similar filter if these vendor accounts do not exist) 
 Vendors with a number ending with “1” and a name containing “of” 
 Vendors with an “e” on the second character of the name 
 Vendors with a name not starting with “C” 
Once you have finished the filtering tasks given above, open the advanced filter 
dialog and select vendors, who do not have Terms of payment “Net 30 days”.

2.2 
Printing and Reporting 
Depending on your requirements, there are several options for viewing and 
analyzing data. Apart from printing Dynamics AX standard reports and using the 
Microsoft Office integration, you can apply Business Intelligence tools (including 
Microsoft Power BI) and the Management Reporter (for financial reports). 
2.2.1 
Printing of Documents 
In Dynamics AX, there are following ways to print documents: 
 Browser page printing – Printing any list page or form as a web page using the 
printing page features of your browser 
 Standard report preview download – Printing a report to the screen (print 
preview) and exporting a PDF or Word file from there 
 Standard report direct printing – Directly sending a standard report to a local 
or network printer 
The option of printing Dynamics AX pages from your browser, which works like 
printing any other web page, does not require any print setting in Dynamics AX. 
Standard reports are formatted documents based on Microsoft SQL Server 
Reporting Services (SSRS). When printing a standard report, you can either 
download a file from the print preview, or send the document directly to a local or 
network printer. If you want to send documents directly to a printer, you have to 
configure the Document Reporting Services. 
Note: When printing a list page or form, there may be different results depending 
on the selected browser (Internet Explorer, Google, Chrome, or other). 
2.2.1.1 Document Reporting Services Setup 
Document Reporting Services are hosted in Microsoft Azure. If you want to 
connect your printers to the Azure services, you have to install the Document 
Routing Agent on one or more client computers in your network. 
 
Figure 2-20: Selecting printers in the Document Routing Agent 

2.2  Printing and Reporting 
31 
In order to install the Document Routing Agent, open the form Organization 
administration> Setup> Network printers and click the button OPTIONS/Application/ 
Download document routing agent installer. After installing the application, open the 
Document Routing Agent on your client desktop and click the Settings button in the 
toolbar. Enter the Dynamics AX URL (the same URL which you use to access 
Dynamics AX in the browser) and the Azure AD Tenant (Domain name of the 
Azure Active Directory / Microsoft Office 365 account). Then click the button OK 
and the button Sign In. Finally click the button Printers and put a checkmark in 
front of the printers which you want to use in Dynamics AX. 
In the Dynamics AX network printer form (Organization administration> Setup> 
Network printers), you can now view the printers which have been enabled by one 
or more Document Routing Agents. Once the form is in edit mode, select the option 
“Yes” in the column Active for all printers to be used in the current company. 
2.2.1.2 Printing Standard Reports 
In each Dynamics AX module, there are standard reports in the folder Inquiries and 
reports. In addition, some list pages and detail forms also provide the option to run 
a standard report by clicking the appropriate button – e.g. a customer account 
statement by clicking the button COLLECT/Customer balances/Statements in the 
customer list page (Accounts receivable> Customers> All customers). 
In order to explain how to print a report in Dynamics AX, the description below 
shows the example of printing a standard report from the menu. After selecting the 
menu item, Dynamics AX shows the report dialog where you can enter filter 
criteria and print destinations. Figure 2-21 for example shows the report dialog of 
the customer list (Accounts receivable> Inquiries and reports> Customers> Customer 
report) after a filter on the group “DO” has been entered. 
 
Figure 2-21: Report dialog for the customer list 
Filter criteria are not directly entered in the report dialog, but in a filter dialog 
which you can access by clicking the button Filter on the tab Records to include of 
the report dialog. The filter dialog for reports works similar to the advanced filter 

32 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
in list pages and detail forms. Apart from entering filter criteria on the tab Range, 
you can enter sorting criteria on the tab Sorting. After closing the filter dialog, the 
selected filter shows in the report dialog. 
The button Change on the tab Destination of the report dialog opens the print 
destination settings, where you can select the destination for the printout. Table 2-2 
below shows the available options for the print destination. 
Table 2-2: 
Print destinations for reports 
Destination 
Explanation 
Print archive 
Saves the report selection to the print archive 
Screen 
Shows a report preview on the screen 
Printer 
Prints the report to the selected printer (available printers are 
specified in the network printer form as described above) 
File 
Saves the report content to a CSV, Excel, HTML, XML, or PDF file 
E-mail 
Saves the report content to a file and sends it to an e-mail recipient 
(the recipient has to be entered manually) 
Once you have finished entering the print destination and the filter criteria in the 
report dialog, print the report by clicking the button OK in the report dialog. The 
settings used when printing the report are automatically stored in the user options. 
They show by default when printing the selected report again. You can change the 
filter criteria and the print destination as required then. 
2.2.1.3 Print Preview 
 
Figure 2-22: Print preview options 

2.2  Printing and Reporting 
33 
If you select the screen as print destination, Dynamics AX shows a print preview 
on the screen. The preview includes following options (see Figure 2-22): 
 Scroll [1] between pages by entering the page number (button Go to) or clicking 
the button for the first page 
, previous page 
, next page 
, or last page 
 
 Find [2] text in the report 
 Zoom [3] in and out 
 Refresh [4] the preview in order to retrieve current data 
 Export [5] the preview to different file formats including XML, CSV, PDF, 
HTML, TIFF, Excel or Word 
 Print [6] the preview 
 Link [7] which provides access to the detail form for selected fields 
2.2.1.4 Print Archive 
The print archive allows saving a report within Dynamics AX. You can save to the 
archive either by selecting the print archive as print destination in the report dialog 
or – if choosing a different print destination – by setting the slider Save in print 
archive to “Yes”. 
When saving to the archive, the report selection is stored in the print archive which 
makes it possible to reprint the report later. If you want to access your print 
archive, open the form Common> Inquiries> Print archive. In order to access the print 
archives of all users, open the form Organization administration> Inquiries and 
reports> Print archive. 
2.2.1.5 Post and Print 
When posting an external document (e.g. an invoice or a packing slip), you also 
want to print the document in most cases. Posting dialogs therefore contain a 
parameter for printing the related document – e.g. the slider Print invoice when 
posting a sales invoice. The buttons Select (filter selection) and Printer setup (printer 
selection) in posting dialogs provide the option to specify filter criteria and print 
destinations as described for standard reports above. 
In case the printout of a posted document is required at a later date (e.g. if you 
have missed to set the slider Print to “Yes” when posting), you can still print it in 
the inquiry of the particular posted document. If you want to (re-)print a sales 
invoice for example, open the sales invoice journal (Accounts receivable> Inquiries 
and reports> Invoices> Invoice journal) and click the button INVOICE/Document/ 
View/Original preview in the action pane after selecting the invoice. 
2.2.1.6 Batch Processing 
If you do not need to view the results of a particular report or a periodic activity 
immediately, you can switch to the tab Run in the background in the report dialog 
and submit the report to a batch process. After setting the slider Batch processing to 

34 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
“Yes” and – if required – selecting a Batch group, specify the starting time and 
repetitions for the batch job by clicking the button Recurrence. 
 
Figure 2-23: Batch processing selection in a report dialog 
As a prerequisite for batch processing, at least one batch server has to be set up and 
started. You can set up the batch server in the menu item System administration> 
Setup> Server configuration. If you want to categorize batch jobs, you can use batch 
groups (System administration> Setup> Batch group). 
Batch processing is a background process on the batch server, except for client and 
private tasks which require running the periodic activity Organization 
administration> Periodic> Batch processing on a client. 
If you want to check and to edit the status of batch jobs, open the form System 
administration> Inquiries> Batch jobs. 
2.2.1.7 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
As a result of the browser-based interface, the regular printing features of the 
browser replace the AX 2012 auto-report features for printing information in 
Dynamics AX pages and forms. In addition, the cloud-based architecture requires 
the Document Routing Agent for connecting printers to the Azure services. 
2.2.2 
Microsoft Office Integration 
The Microsoft Office integration in Dynamics AX provides an easy way for data 
interaction with Microsoft Office. This data interaction includes: 
 Static export – Export data from Dynamics AX to Microsoft Excel 
 Opening and editing – Update data in Dynamics AX from Microsoft Office 
By use of document templates, you can easily create your own Excel workbooks 
for editing Dynamics AX data in Excel. 

2.2  Printing and Reporting 
35 
2.2.2.1 Static Export to Excel 
The static export to Excel, which provides the option to retrieve data from 
Dynamics AX for viewing them in an Excel workbook, is available in most list 
pages and detail forms. 
As a prerequisite for the static export, open the respective form in Dynamics AX 
and select lines for the export by marking the appropriate grid check boxes 
leftmost in the grid. Instead of using the grid check boxes, you can also select lines 
by clicking them directly in the grid while holding the Ctrl key. The Shift key 
selects multiple consecutive lines, and the grid check box in the header line selects 
all lines of the grid. 
The button Open in Microsoft Office 
 / Export to Excel in the action pane of list 
pages then provides the option to export the list to Microsoft Excel. Alternatively, 
you can right-click in the grid of a list page to open the context menu where you 
can choose the option Export all rows or Export marked rows. 
 
Figure 2-24: Choosing the export location when exporting to Excel 
In the export dialog (see Figure 2-24) you can subsequently select whether you 
want to download the Excel workbook content to your local computer or if you 
want to export to OneDrive or SharePoint using Excel Online. 
2.2.2.2 Opening Data in Excel 
Unlike the static export, which just retrieves data from Dynamics AX to Excel, the 
option Open in Microsoft Office supports updating and inserting data from Excel to 
Dynamics AX. It is available in most list pages and detail forms. In order to start 
editing data in Excel, open the respective form in Dynamics AX, click the button 
 
(Open in Microsoft Office) in the action pane and select the appropriate option below 
the heading Open in Excel. In some forms, for example in the general journals 
(General ledger> Journal entries> General journals), there is a dedicated button in the 
action pane for opening in Excel. 

36 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
In the Open in Excel dialog you can subsequently select if you want to download 
the Excel workbook for working on your local computer or if you want to open it 
in OneDrive or SharePoint using Excel Online. 
Microsoft Excel then displays the data connector in the task pane, where you have 
to sign in with your Azure Active Directory account before retrieving data. In 
Excel you can subsequently edit and insert data (button New), also working 
temporarily offline in Excel if required. 
Clicking the button Refresh in the Excel worksheet retrieves current data from 
Dynamics AX, including new lines for new records. In order to transfer data from 
Excel to Dynamics AX, click the button Publish. In case incorrect data are going to 
be published, an error message in the Excel task pane shows the issue (click the 
button  at the bottom of the pane to see the details) and prevents the update. 
2.2.2.3 Using Document Templates  
You can create your own Excel worksheets and use them for updating data in 
Dynamics AX if you upload them as document templates. 
As a starting point, open the Excel workbook designer (Common> Office integration> 
Excel workbook designer) and select the Dynamics AX table for which you want to 
create the Excel workbook. Then move the fields you want to include in Excel from 
the Available fields pane to the Selected fields. In the next step, click the button Create 
workbook in the action pane for downloading the Excel workbook to your computer 
or exporting it to OneDrive or SharePoint. After signing in, you can immediately 
use the worksheet for updating Dynamics AX data as described above. 
If you save the Excel worksheet, you can upload it as document template in order 
to make it available as Open in Excel option. Open the document templates 
(Common> Office integration> Document templates) for this purpose, click the button 
New in the action pane and upload the Excel file which you have saved in the 
previous step. The new template then shows as additional option in the button 
 
(Open in Microsoft Office) of the related Dynamics AX form. 
2.2.2.4 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
As a result of the cloud-based architecture, the AX 2012 Copy/Paste functionality is 
not available any more. The Microsoft Office integration has completely changed, 
now providing additional options. 
2.2.3

Advanced Options 
Before you can log on to Microsoft Dynamics AX, a Dynamics AX user with 
appropriate permissions has to be set up for you. In some areas of the application, 
a worker record (see section 10.2.2) assigned to your user is required additionally. 
2.3.1 
User Options and Personalization 
Options for personally adjusting the Dynamics AX user interface are available in 
the user options. In addition, personalization provides enhanced features for 
individually configuring every single form. 
2.3.1.1 User Options 
The user options are a form controlling core personal settings in Dynamics AX. 
You can access your user options by clicking the button 
/Options in the 
navigation bar (or accessing the menu item Common> Setup> User options) if you 
have got appropriate permissions. System administrators can access your user 
options from the user management (System administration> Users> Users, button 
User options). 
 
Figure 2-25: Managing preferences in the user options form 
Main settings in the user option form as shown in Figure 2-25 include following 
preferences for your workspace: 
 Language – Language of the user interface 
 Country/region – Default value for country/region when entering an address 
 Company – Default-company when logging on 
 Default view/edit mode – Start all detail forms in view mode or in edit mode 
 Document handling – See section 10.5.1

2.3.1.2 Usage Data 
The button Usage data in the action pane of the user options opens a form, which 
shows detailed settings of a user. These settings include filter settings, form 
settings, and record templates (user templates), which have been stored 
automatically or manually. 
In the usage data, you can switch from the tab General to the other tabs if you want 
to view the usage data in a particular area. Clicking the button Data after selecting 
a usage data record shows the record details. It is not possible to modify usage 
data, but you can delete usage data records by clicking the button Delete or 
pressing the shortcut key Alt+F9. Clicking the button Reset on the tab General 
deletes all your usage data. 
2.3.1.3 Setup for Personalization 
Apart from modifications in the development environment, which apply to all 
users, changes of the user interface in list pages and forms are also possible at 
personal level. For this purpose, each user with appropriate permissions in 
Dynamics AX can adjust forms according to his personal requirements. 
The personalization setup (System administration> Setup> Personalization) contains 
settings whether personalization is allowed. On the tab Users, you can override the 
general setting specified on the tab System. In addition, you can export and import 
personalizations on the Users tab. 
2.3.1.4 Implicit Personalization 
In list pages and the grid of other forms, you change the width of columns with 
your mouse (drag and drop in the header column). Dynamics AX also remembers 
the settings for showing the full action pane, the fast tabs, and the FactBoxes per 
page in your personalization. 
2.3.1.5 Explicit Personalization 
If you need enhanced options to adjust a form according to your personal 
preferences, you can use the element personalization window and the 
personalization toolbar. These options are available in every list page, detail form, 
workspace, and dashboard. 
In order to access the element personalization window, right-click an element (e.g. 
a field shown in a list page) and choose the option Personalize in the context menu. 
The personalization window then provides the option to override several standard 
settings – for example by entering a personal field label, hiding the element, or 
preventing to edit the field content. 
The personalization toolbar, which you can access by clicking the link Personalize 
this form in the element personalization window or by clicking the button 
OPTIONS/Personalize/Personalize this form in the action pane, provides additional 
options. 

2.3  Advanced Options 
39 
 
Figure 2-26: Element personalization window and personalization toolbar in a list page 
In the personalization toolbar, you can personalize the form by clicking the 
appropriate button, and then selecting the field or other element to which you 
want to apply the selected action. Options in the personalization toolbar include 
Select 
 (shows the element personalization window as described above), Move 
 
(change the location of an element), Hide 
, Summary 
 (in detail forms, shows the 
field as summary field on the fast tab), Skip 
 (skip in the tab sequence), Edit 
 
(prevents editing), and Add 
 (add a table field to display in the form). If you add 
a field, you have to select the page area where you want to add the field before a 
dialog shows where you can select one or multiple table fields. 
Settings in the personalization apply immediately. The button Manage in the 
personalization toolbar provides the option to reset the form to the standard layout 
(button Manage/Clear) and to export or import the personalization. 
Apart from changing the layout of a form, personalization includes the option to 
add a list page to a workspace by clicking the button OPTIONS/Personalize/Add to 
workspace in the action pane. After selecting the appropriate Workspace and the 
Presentation (tile or list) you have to click the button Configure and to select some 
options in a subsequent dialog. When you are finished, the list page shows as 
additional list or tile in the selected – now personalized – workspace. 
In the workspace, the element personalization window for tiles includes the 
additional option to pin a tile to the dashboard. If you select this option, the 
dashboard shows the selected form which means that you can directly access it 
from the dashboard. 
2.3.1.6 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The browser-based user interface has required a completely new personalization 
functionality. The new personalization only stores changes to the standard, making 
it possible to keep personalization even if there are modifications or AX updates. 
2.3.2 
Record Information and Templates 
The record information dialog in Dynamics AX provides access to data and to 
general features not directly shown in a particular list page or detail form. 

40 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
2.3.2.1 Options in the Record Information Dialog 
After selecting a record, you can open the record information dialog in a list page 
or detail form by clicking the button OPTIONS/Page options/Record info. 
The Record information dialog provides following options for the selected record: 
 Rename key field – Agree with system administration before using this option 
 Show all fields and Database log – Information on the selected record 
 Script – Create an insert script 
 Company accounts template and User template – Create a record template 
Note: Depending on your permissions and the Dynamics AX configuration, some 
options might not be available. 
 
Figure 2-27: The record information dialog in the vendor detail form 
2.3.2.2 Renaming 
You can rename the key field of a record by clicking the button Rename in the 
record information dialog. Renaming then opens a second dialog for entering the 
new field content. 
Processing a request for renaming may be a time-consuming activity, because 
Dynamics AX has to update all references. If you want to modify a vendor number 
for example, the update does not only include the vendor table itself, but also the 
vendor transactions, the purchase orders, and all other tables which contain the 
vendor number. You have to take into account, that references are only updated 

2.3  Advanced Options 
41 
within Dynamics AX. Other applications and external partners like customers or 
vendors have to receive the appropriate information separately. 
Renaming therefore is an exceptional activity, usually with restricted access 
secured by appropriate permission settings. 
2.3.2.3 Show All Fields and Database Log 
The button Show all fields in the record information dialog displays the content of 
all fields of the selected record. Choose this option if you want to know the content 
of fields not shown in a particular list page or detail form. 
The button Database log in the record information dialog shows a log file of all 
changes to the selected record. As a prerequisite, logging for the particular table 
has to be enabled in the form System administration> Setup> Database log setup or in 
the development environment. 
2.3.2.4 Record Templates 
Record templates help creating new records by copying the content of fields from a 
template created before. As an example, it might be useful to set up a different 
template in the vendor table for domestic vendors and for foreign vendors, which 
initialize the record with correct posting groups when creating a new vendor. 
When working with record templates, you have to distinguish between two types 
of templates: 
 User templates – Only available to the current user 
 Company accounts templates – Available to all users 
A user template is only available to the user who has created it. You can create a 
user template by clicking the button User template in the record information dialog. 
A second dialog then opens where you enter the name and a short description of 
the template. The template then is a copy of the record which you have selected 
when opening the record information dialog. 
User templates are stored in your usage data, where it is not possible to modify 
them later. If a user template is not required any more, you can delete it in the 
usage data (button 
 /Options in the navigation bar> button Usage data> tab Record 
templates). Alternatively, you can delete a user template by pressing the shortcut 
key Alt+F9 in the template selection dialog as shown in Figure 2-28. 
Unlike user templates, company accounts templates are available to all users. You 
can create a company accounts template by clicking the button Company accounts 
template in the record information dialog. 
If you want to access a company accounts template later, open the form Common> 
Setup> Record templates. On the tab Overview of the record templates form, select the 
table to which the template belongs. Then switch to the tab Templates where you 
can view and delete the system template. 

42 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
 
Figure 2-28: Selecting a template in the template dialog 
If there are templates for a table, they display in a template selection dialog when 
inserting a new record in the particular table. Figure 2-28 for example shows the 
dialog displayed when creating a new vendor in the vendor detail form (Accounts 
payable> Vendors> All vendors) once there is a vendor template. 
In the template dialog, select the appropriate template and click the button OK. 
Company account templates show the icon 
 whereas user templates show the 
icon 
. In the far right column, you can optionally select one line to make it the 
default template. If you set the slider Do not ask again at the bottom of the template 
dialog to “Yes”, Dynamics AX applies the default template without showing the 
dialog when inserting further records. If you want to show the template dialog 
when creating new records again, click the button Show template selection which 
then displays in the record information dialog.

Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 2.8 – User Options 
You want to access your user options in order to check your user name and e-mail 
address. In the visual options, select the high-contrast color theme and a small 
element size. The training company should be the Start company accounts when 
logging in to Dynamics AX the next time. 
Exercise 2.9 – Record Templates 
Create a new user template based on the vendor which you have entered in 
exercise 2.4. In order to learn how to use templates, insert a new vendor applying 
this template afterwards. 

2.4  Global Address Book 
43 
2.4 
Global Address Book 
Dynamics AX contains a common table for all business partners of your enterprise 
– internal and external relationships, companies and persons. This common table is 
the global address book, using the label “parties” for the business partners. Parties 
in the global address book are shared across companies and include customers, 
sales leads, vendors, organization units, employees, and other contacts. 
2.4.1 
Party and Address 
When creating a new customer, vendor, or any other kind of party, Dynamics AX 
inserts a record in the global address book. A party may contain one or more 
(postal) addresses and contact information data. A party therefore is not the same 
as an address – a party is an organization or person characterized by its name. 
 
Figure 2-29: Managing a party with multiple addresses in the party detail form 
Depending on permission settings, you can access all parties in the global address 
book (Common> Common> Global address book). The party detail form accessed from 
the global address book shows details like name, addresses, and contact data. 

44 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
2.4.1.1 Creating Parties in the Global Address Book 
You can insert a new party directly in the global address book by clicking the 
button New in the action pane. In the new party record, the Party ID usually 
derives from the appropriate number sequence. The lookup field Type, which 
contains the alternative options “Organization” and “Person”, controls the fields 
which display in the party form (e.g. showing the field First name only for persons). 
After entering the party name in the field Name (for an organization) or in the 
fields First name and Last name (for a person), you can enter additional data. These 
data include the postal address on the tab Addresses and contact data like e-mail 
addresses and phone numbers on the tab Contact information. Section 3.2.1 shows – 
on the example of the vendor management – in more detail how to manage postal 
addresses and contact information. 
2.4.1.2 Indirectly Creating Parties 
Apart from directly creating a party in the global address book, you can also create 
a party indirectly by entering a customer, a vendor, or any other kind of party in 
any module. 
In forms indirectly creating parties, the field Name is a lookup providing the option 
to search an existing party. If you select an existing party in this lookup, the party 
receives an additional role. If you do not select an existing party, but type a new 
name, Dynamics AX automatically creates a new party with this name. 
If you insert a new customer in the customer form (Accounts receivable> Customers> 
All customers) for example, a new party is created in case you type a name in the 
lookup field Name of the Create dialog. If you select an existing party in the lookup 
field Name, the new role “Customer” is assigned to the party. 
Since a party may already exist in the global address book (e.g. a customer being a 
vendor in your own or an affiliated company within a common Dynamics AX 
database), you should – in order to avoid duplicate parties – check existing parties 
before creating a new party record. In case the duplicate check is activated in the 
global address book parameters and you enter a duplicate party anyhow, a 
confirmation dialog shows the existing record before saving the new party. 
2.4.1.3 Internal Organizations 
Apart from external parties (organizations and persons), internal organizations like 
operating units and legal entities (see section 10.1.2) are also parties in the global 
address book. You can recognize internal organizations by the Type (e.g. “Legal 
entities”). Party types reserved for internal organizations are not available when 
manually inserting a party directly in the global address book. 

2.4  Global Address Book 
45 
2.4.2 
Address Book 
An address book is a collection of party records. You can set up one or more 
address books in the form Organization administration> Global address book> Address 
books, e.g. one for sales and one for purchasing. 
The global address book is the collection of all parties in all companies of a 
Dynamics AX system (see Figure 2-30). 
In order to link a party to one or more address books, put a checkmark in front of 
the address books which display in the lookup of the field Address books on the tab 
General of the party detail form. 
 
Figure 2-30: Conceptual structure of the global address book 
You can use address books for filtering addresses – e.g. using the filter field 
Address books in the global address book list page – and as a basis for security 
settings in the extensible data security framework. 
2.4.2.1 Roles 
A role (e.g. “Vendor” or “Customer”) describes the relationship between a party 
and your enterprise. A party can refer to one or more roles in one or more 
companies. There are two ways of assigning a role to a party: 

46 
2  Getting Started: Navigation and General Options 
 Indirectly – Entering a record in other areas like the customer list page 
automatically creates a party with the appropriate role. 
 Directly – Clicking an appropriate button in the action pane of the global 
address book (e.g. PARTY/New/Customer) after selecting a party creates a record 
in the selected area (e.g. customer record) and assigns the related role. 
The roles of a party are shown on the tab Roles of the party detail form. 
2.4.2.2 Address Book Parameters 
If the duplicate check is activated in the global address book parameters 
(Organization administration> Global address book> Global address book parameters, 
slider Use duplicate check), a dialog shows duplicate party records whenever you try 
to create a party (directly or indirectly) with the name of an already existing party. 
In the dialog you can choose whether to use the existing party or to create a new 
party, which by chance has got the same name as the existing party. 
Other global address book parameters include the default party type 
(“Organization” or “Person”) and the name sequence for persons (first/last name). 
Settings regarding the format of postal addresses and available ZIP/postal codes or 
cities are specified in the address setup (Organization administration> Global address 
book> Addresses> Address setup). 
2.4.3 
Case Study Exercise 
Exercise 2.10 – Global Address Book 
In order to learn the functionality of the global address book, check if you can find 
the party record of your vendor from exercise 2.4. 
The next task is to insert a new party in the global address book. Fields to be 
entered include the name “##-Exercise 2.10” (## = your user ID) and a postal 
address in London. The new party becomes a vendor in your company. What do 
you do in Dynamics AX?

Purchase Management 
The primary responsibility of purchasing is to provide your company with goods 
and services from suppliers. Including tasks in previous and subsequent areas, the 
complete procurement process covers following activities: 
 Determining material requirements in operations planning 
 Processing purchase requisitions, requests for quotations, and purchase orders 
 Posting item receipts and purchase invoices 
3.1 
Business Processes in Purchasing 
Before we start to go into the details, the lines below give an overview of the 
business processes in purchasing. 
3.1.1 
Basic Approach 
Starting point for procurement are correct master data, in particular the data on 
vendors and products. When purchasing services or non-inventoried commodities, 
you can use procurement categories instead of products. 
3.1.1.1 Master Data and Transactions in Purchasing 
Vendor and product records are master data, only occasionally updated after 
initially creating the individual records. In the course of the purchasing process, 
planned and actual purchase orders (transaction data) receive default values from 
vendor and product records (master data), which you can override in the 
transaction – for example if agreeing on special payment terms in a purchase order. 
Modifying data in a transaction does not update the related master data. If you 
agree with a particular vendor to change for example the payment terms in 
general, you have to update the payment terms in the vendor record. 
Based on correct master data, the purchasing process – including required 
predecessor and successor activities – consists of six steps as shown in Figure 3-1.

3  Purchase Management 
3.1.1.2 Material Requirements, Purchase Requisition, and Request for Quotation 
The identification of material requirements usually is the first step in the 
purchasing process. Depending on the particular product and the company-
specific circumstances, there are two ways for processing material requirements: 
 Automatically – Generating planned orders 
 Manually – Entering purchase requisitions 
The required basis for generating accurate planned orders within operations 
planning (master planning, see section 6.3) are accurate figures on inventory 
quantity, sales orders, purchase orders and forecasts on the one hand, and 
appropriate item coverage settings on the other. 
Purchase requisitions – unlike planned orders, which are created automatically by 
master planning – are manually entered, internal documents asking the purchase 
department to acquire specific items (like consumables and office supplies). A 
purchase requisition runs through an approval process workflow before it is 
released as a purchase order. 
Requests for quotation are sent to vendors in order to receive information on prices 
and delivery times. The purchasing department can enter requests for quotation 
either manually, or generate them from planned purchase orders or purchase 
requisitions. 
3.1.1.3 Purchase Order 
You can create purchase orders either manually or by transferring planned orders, 
purchase requisitions, or requests for quotation. A purchase order consists of a 
header, containing fields which are common to the whole order (e.g. vendor data), 
and one or more lines, containing the required items. 
Once you have completed entering the order, you have to start the approval 
process (in case change management is active). After approval – or without 
approval if change management does not apply – you can optionally post a 
purchase inquiry and send it to the vendor for validation purposes. 
Before you can continue with order processing, you have to post a purchase order 
confirmation. Posting the confirmation means to save it, optionally sending it to 
the vendor electronically or as printed document. The purchase order confirmation 
is available with its original content afterwards, no matter if there is a later 
modification on the actual purchase order. 
The status of a purchase order is indicated by the order status and the document 
status in the header, and by the posted quantities in the lines. Inquiries, workspace 
information, and periodic reports provide the option to recognize issues like late 
shipments. 

3.1  Business Processes in Purchasing 
49 
3.1.1.4 Product Receipt, Invoice Receipt, and Vendor Payment 
Once the goods or services actually arrive, you should record the product receipt 
in Dynamics AX. Posting the product receipt increases the physical quantity in 
inventory and reduces the open quantity in the purchase order. 
Together with the item delivery, or at a later time, the vendor submits an invoice. 
When registering the invoice in the vendor invoice form, invoice control features 
support matching the invoice with the purchase order and the product receipt. If 
an invoice is not related to a purchase order, you can enter it in the vendor invoice 
form or in an invoice journal (see section 9.3.3). 
Based on posted invoices, you can record payments to vendors either manually or 
through a payment proposal. Payment proposals include due date and cash 
discount period calculation. Payment processing is independent from purchase 
orders and usually a responsibility of the finance department. You can find a 
description on vendor payments in section 9.3.4 later in this book. 
3.1.1.5 Ledger Integration and Voucher Principle 
Because of the deep finance integration in Dynamics AX, all inventory and vendor 
transactions in purchasing are posted to ledger accounts specified in the setup as 
described in section 9.4. 
In order to keep track of the whole business process, Dynamics AX 
comprehensively applies the voucher principle to transactions: You have to 
register a transaction in a document (voucher), before you can post it. After 
posting, it is not possible to modify the document any more. Figure 3-2 shows an 
overview of the documents in purchase order processing. 
 
Figure 3-2: 
Transactions and posted documents in purchasing

3  Purchase Management 
3.1.2 
At a Glance: Purchase Order Processing 
In order to provide an overview of the main steps in purchase order processing, 
this section shows the basics. In the example, we create an order starting in the 
Purchase order preparation workspace and post all transactions directly in the 
purchase order form. Of course you can also create the order from the vendor 
form, or directly in the purchase order list page. 
In the Purchase order preparation workspace, which you can access from the 
dashboard or from the Workspaces folder of the Procurement and sourcing menu, 
click the button New purchase order in the action pane. The Create purchase order 
dialog shows next, where you have to select a vendor in the Vendor account field 
(you can trigger the search there by starting to type the first characters of the 
vendor name). Clicking the button OK in the dialog creates a purchase order 
header with default data like language or currency from the selected vendor. 
The purchase order detail form then opens in lines view. If you are in view mode, 
switch to the edit mode by clicking the button Edit or by pressing the F2 key. On 
the tab Purchase order lines, you can start to enter an order line with item number, 
quantity, and price. When selecting the item, Dynamics AX initializes the quantity, 
the price, and other fields like the site with appropriate default values. If you want 
to enter a second line, press the Down Arrow on the keyboard or click the button 
Add line in the toolbar. Clicking the button Header (or Lines) below the action pane 
switches between the lines view (see Figure 3-3) and the header view. 
 
Figure 3-3: 
Entering a purchase order line (Lines view, in edit mode) 
If change management applies, the Approval status (shown on the right-hand side 
below the action pane) is “Draft” and you have got to click the button 
Workflow/Submit in the action pane after entering all order lines. After approval – 
or without change management immediately – the Approval status is “Approved”.

Next, post the purchase order confirmation by clicking the button PURCHASE/ 
Generate/Confirmation (or PURCHASE/Actions/Confirm) in the action pane. If you 
want to print the purchase order, set the sliders Posting and Print purchase order in 
the posting dialog to “Yes”. The button Printer setup in the dialog provides the 
option to select a printer for the printout (compare section 2.2.1). 
 
Figure 3-4: 
Confirming and printing the purchase order 
When receiving the item, post the product receipt by clicking the button RECEIVE/ 
Generate/Product receipt in the action pane of the purchase order form. Posting the 
product receipt work similar to the purchase order confirmation described above. 
But unlike purchase order confirmation, the product receipt usually is not printed. 
If there is no prior item arrival registration, select the option “Ordered quantity” in 
the lookup field Quantity and enter the vendor’s packing slip number in the 
column Product receipt on the tab Overview of the posting dialog before clicking OK. 
The product receipt increases the physical quantity in inventory and changes the 
order status to “Received”. 
If you want to post the invoice receipt directly from the purchase order form, click 
the button INVOICE/Generate/Invoice in the action pane of the order form. 
Containing an action pane and FactBoxes, the form for vendor invoice posting is 
different from the other posting dialogs. In order to check the totals there, view the 
appropriate FactBox on the right of the form or click the button Totals in the action 
pane. After entering the vendor invoice number in the field Number (Invoice 
identification), post the invoice by clicking the button Post. Invoice posting 
generates an open vendor transaction to be paid and changes the order status to 
“Invoiced”. 
Note: If you want to quit the invoice form without saving, delete the invoice there 
and do not simply close the form (which would save a pending invoice). 

52 
3  Purchase Management 
3.2 
Vendor Management 
Vendor records are required in purchasing and in accounts payable. According to 
the deep integration of Dynamics AX, there is only one record for each vendor, 
which then applies to all areas of the application. You can restrict access to the 
fields and field groups of the vendor form through appropriate permissions. 
3.2.1 
Vendor Record 
In order to check existing or to create new vendors, open the vendor list page in 
the procurement module (Procurement and sourcing> Vendors> All vendors), or in the 
accounts payable module (Accounts payable> Vendors> All vendors), or through the 
navigation search. According to the general structure of list pages, the vendor page 
shows the list of all vendors. If you want to view the details of a vendor in the list 
page, click the link in the Vendor account field of the particular vendor. 
Apart from the vendor list page, the Purchase order preparation workspace also 
provides access to the vendor detail form (list Find vendor in the tabbed list pane). 
 
Figure 3-5: 
Selecting a vendor in the vendor list page 
In the vendor detail form, you can switch to the edit mode by clicking the button 
Edit in the action pane or by pressing the F2 key. If you are in edit mode in the list 
page before accessing the detail form, the detail form will open in edit mode. 
The vendor detail form contains numerous fields which are used as default values 
in purchase orders. The following description covers core data in the vendor 
record, additional information is available in the online help. 

3.2  Vendor Management 
53 
3.2.1.1 Creating a Vendor 
If you want to create a new vendor, insert a record in the vendor list page or in the 
detail form by pushing the shortcut key Alt+N or by clicking the button New in the 
action pane. If there are templates for vendors in your company (see section 2.3.2), 
you can populate fields of the new record by choosing a template. 
Depending on settings of the related number sequence, a unique vendor number in 
the field Vendor account is assigned automatically or has to be entered manually.  
3.2.1.2 Global Address Book Integration 
In the vendor detail form, the field Type in the field group Identification determines 
if the vendor is a company (organization) or a person. Depending on the type, the 
General tab shows different fields – e.g. First name and Last name for the type 
“Person”. 
Vendors are parties in the global address book. For this reason, the field Name is a 
lookup field providing the option to select an existing party from the global 
address book when creating a new vendor. If you enter the name of a new vendor 
manually, a dialog displays in case an existing party has got exactly the same name 
and the duplicate check is activated in the global address book parameters. This 
dialog provides the option to link the vendor to an existing party or to create a new 
party, which by chance has got the same name. 
After saving the vendor record, you can access the related party in the global 
address book through the table reference (View details) on the vendor name field. 
As an alternative to the vendor form, you can create new vendors in the global 
address book (Common> Common> Global address book, see section 2.4) in order to 
reduce the risk of duplicate party records. In the global address book, it is easy to 
check if a new vendor already is a party (e.g. being a vendor in an affiliated 
company) before creating the new vendor. If the vendor is a party, convert the 
party to a vendor in your company by clicking the button PARTY/New/Vendor after 
selecting the record. If not, create the party record before converting it to a vendor. 
3.2.1.3 General Data 
The search name in the vendor record is initialized with the vendor name, but you 
can modify it. Mandatory fields in the vendor form (apart from the name) are the 
vendor group in the lookup field Group (usually controlling ledger integration, see 
section 3.2.3), and the currency on the tab Purchasing demographics (initialized with 
the accounting currency). 
Further core fields on the tab General are the Language, specifying the language for 
printing purchase orders or other documents, and – in case address books are 
used, especially for access control – the Address books linked to the vendor. 
The display field Vendor hold on the tab Miscellaneous details shows whether the 
vendor is blocked. If you want to change the hold status, click the button 

54 
3  Purchase Management 
VENDOR/Maintain/On hold in the action pane. If you select the vendor hold status 
“All”, it is not possible to enter or to post any purchase order or other transaction 
for the vendor. The options “No” and “Never” enable all transactions (“Never” 
prevents automatic blocking of the vendor after a period of inactivity). 
3.2.1.4 Input Tax 
Tax settings for the vendor have to be entered on the tab Invoice and delivery, where 
the Sales tax group (VAT group) determines the tax duty depending on the vendor 
location. A correct sales tax group is necessary to distinguish between domestic 
vendors, who charge sales tax or VAT, and foreign vendors, who do not. The setup 
of sales tax groups and tax calculation is depending on your company and its 
location. Section 9.2.6 contains more information on the tax setup in Dynamics AX. 
If your company is located within the European Union and you need to record the 
VAT registration number of vendors for tax purposes, enter it in the Tax exempt 
number (VAT number) field below the sales tax group. Since it is a lookup field, you 
have to insert a new tax-exempt number in the main table (View details in the 
context menu, or Tax> Setup> Sales tax> Tax exempt numbers) before selecting it in 
the vendor record. 
The Tax exempt number requirement and Mandatory tax group settings in the accounts 
payable parameters (Accounts payable> Setup> Accounts payable parameters, tab 
General) determine if you have to enter a tax exempt number and/or a sales tax 
group when creating a vendor. 
3.2.1.5 Settings for Delivery and Payment 
The field Delivery terms on the tab Invoice and delivery of the vendor detail form 
specifies the usual delivery terms of the particular vendor. You can access the 
setup of required delivery terms including text in foreign languages in the form 
Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Distribution> Terms of delivery. 
The tab Payment of the vendor detail form contains settings on payment terms and 
cash discount. More details on these settings are available in section 3.2.2. 
3.2.1.6 Postal Address 
Address data display on the tab Addresses of the vendor detail form. Dynamics AX 
provides the option to maintain multiple addresses per vendor. Addresses and 
contact data are stored in the global address book party record which is linked to 
the particular vendor. For this reason, address and contact data are shared with all 
other roles of the party (e.g. if the vendor also is a customer or a vendor in another 
company in Dynamics AX). 
If you want to enter an additional postal address of a vendor, click the button Add 
in the toolbar of the tab Addresses. In the New address dialog, enter the identification 
(Name or description) of the address – for the primary address usually the vendor 

3.2  Vendor Management 
55 
name. In the primary address of a vendor, make sure the slider Primary is (and the 
slider Private is not) set to “Yes”. 
The Purpose in the address dialog determines, for which transactions the current 
address is used as default value. For a primary address, choose the purpose 
“Business”. If entering a second address, choose an alternative purpose – for 
example the option “Payment” identifying an alternative payee. One postal 
address can have multiple purposes at the same time. If no specific address is 
specified for a particular purpose, the primary address applies. 
You can view the available standard address purposes and set up additional 
purposes in the form Organization administration> Global address book> Address and 
contact information purpose. 
Another important setting in a postal address is the Country/region, which is the 
basis for the address format on the one hand and for reports to the authorities – 
including sales tax and Intrastat reports – on the other. 
After selecting the country code, only postal codes of this country show in the 
lookup of the ZIP/postal Code field. Depending on the settings in the address setup 
(Organization administration> Global address book> Addresses> Address setup, tab 
Parameters), postal codes are validated in the ZIP/postal code table when entering 
an address. If ZIP/postal code validation is activated, you have to insert a new 
postal code in the ZIP/postal code table before you can enter it in an address. You 
can access the postal code table on the tab ZIP/postal codes of the address setup 
form, or through the table reference (View details) on the ZIP/postal code field. 
Clicking the button More options/Advanced in the toolbar of the tab Addresses in the 
vendor form provides access to the address details. The tab Contact information 
there contains contact data, which are specific to the particular address (e.g. the 
phone number of the alternate payee) and not general contact data of the vendor. 
3.2.1.7 Contact Information 
In order to enter general contact data of a vendor (e.g. the vendor telephone 
number or the general e-mail address), click the button Add in the toolbar on the 
tab Contact information of the vendor detail form. 
On the tab Purchasing demographics of the vendor detail form, you can select a main 
contact person in the field Primary contact. If you want to select a new main contact, 
enter the data of this person first (button VENDOR/Set up/Contacts/Add contacts in 
the action pane of the vendor form). 
3.2.1.8 Features in the Vendor Form 
Clicking the buttons in the action pane of the vendor list page or detail form 
provides access to various inquiries and activities on the selected vendor: 

56 
3  Purchase Management 
 Action pane tab VENDOR: 
o Contacts – Managing vendor contact persons 
o Bank accounts – Managing vendor bank accounts for payment 
o Transactions – Showing vendor invoices and payments 
o Balance – Showing the total of open liabilities 
 Action pane tab PROCUREMENT: 
o New/Purchase order – Entering an order, see section 3.4.2 
o Related information/Purchase orders – Viewing current orders 
o Agreements/Trade agreements, Purchase prices, Discounts – 
 
Viewing purchase prices and discounts, see section 3.3.3 
o Agreements/Purchase agreements – Blanket orders, see section 3.8.1 
 Action pane tab INVOICE: 
o New/Invoice – Entering a vendor invoice, see section 9.3.3 
o Settle/Settle transactions – Settling invoices, see section 9.2.5 
o Related information/Invoice – Viewing posted invoices 
3.2.1.9 One-time Vendor 
One-time vendors provide the option to keep master data of regular suppliers 
separate from vendors, who supply items rarely or only once.  
The accounts payable parameters (Accounts payable> Setup> Accounts payable 
parameters, tab General) include the vendor number of a vendor used as template 
for one-time vendors. In addition, a separate number sequence for one-time 
vendors is available on the tab Number sequences of the parameters. 
 
Figure 3-6: 
Creating a one-time vendor in a new purchase order 
If these parameters are set up for one-time vendors, set the slider One-time supplier 
in the dialog shown in Figure 3-6 to “Yes” (instead of choosing an existing vendor) 
when creating a purchase order in the list page Procurement and sourcing> Purchase 
orders> All purchase orders. Create an order selecting “Yes” in the One-time supplier 
automatically generates a new vendor. 

3.2  Vendor Management 
57 
In the vendor record of these vendors, the vendor account number derives from 
the number-sequence for one-time vendors, and the checkbox One-time supplier on 
the tab Vendor profile of the vendor form is selected. Clearing this checkbox 
transforms a one-time vendor to a regular vendor (keeping the one-time vendor 
number). 
3.2.2 
Payment Terms and Cash Discount 
Unlike other business applications, which include cash discount settings in the 
payment terms, Dynamics AX clearly distinguishes payment terms and cash 
discount providing two different fields for these settings. 
Payment terms and cash discounts in Dynamics AX are shared between vendors 
and customers. The related administration forms therefore are available in both 
menus – the accounts payable menu and the accounts receivable menu. The 
calculation of the due date and the cash discount date starts from the document 
date, which you can enter in the invoice. If you leave the document date empty, 
Dynamics AX applies the posting date as the start date for due date calculation. 
But especially in purchase invoices, the document date may deviate from the 
posting date. 
You can modify the due date and the cash discount date when posting an invoice 
or when settling it in the settle transactions form (see section 9.2.5). 
3.2.2.1 Terms of Payment 
In order to edit the payment terms, open the form Accounts payable> Payment setup> 
Terms of payment in the accounts payable menu (or Accounts receivable> Payment 
setup> Terms of payment in the accounts receivable menu). If you want to edit a 
record, make sure that you are in edit mode. 
 
Figure 3-7: 
Settings for due date calculation in the terms of payment 

58 
3  Purchase Management 
The left-hand pane in this form shows the list of payment terms with ID and 
description. The settings for due date calculation of a particular payment term are 
shown on the right-hand side. 
The lookup field Payment method on the tab Setup determines the start date for due 
date calculation: “Net” means starting from the document date, “Current month” 
means starting from month end. The period length for due date calculation is 
specified by the number of Days and Months. If required, there is also the option to 
choose a payment schedule. 
The button Translations provides the option to enter a longer text in the own 
language and in foreign languages. If there is a payment terms text in the language 
selected in a particular document, this text will be printed on external documents 
(e.g. the printed purchase order) instead of the content in the field Description of 
the payment terms. 
3.2.2.2 Cash on Delivery 
If you need payment terms for cash on delivery, choose the Payment method 
“COD”, set the slider Cash payment to “Yes”, and select the appropriate petty cash 
main account number in the field Cash. When posting an invoice referring to these 
payment terms, Dynamics AX immediately posts the payment and settles the 
invoice with the petty cash account of the payment terms. 
3.2.2.3 Cash Discount 
Similar to the payment terms setup, the cash discount setup is included in the 
accounts payable menu as well as in the accounts receivable menu (Accounts 
payable> Payment setup> Cash discounts and Accounts receivable> Payment setup> Cash 
discounts). 
 
Figure 3-8: 
Setting up a cash discount 

3.2  Vendor Management 
59 
Setting up cash discounts works like setting up payment terms, but you have to 
add a cash discount percentage and settings for posting the cash discount to the 
general ledger. 
Cash discounts are in common for accounts payable and accounts receivable, but 
different settings for posting the cash discount are required for vendors and for 
customers (the settings apply at the time when posting the payment): 
 Accounts receivable – Main account for customer discounts 
 Accounts payable – The main account is depending on the lookup Discount 
offset accounts in the cash discount and contains following options: 
o Use main account for vendor discounts – Posting to the Main account for vendor 
discounts entered in the field below 
o Accounts on the invoice lines – Posting to the accounts of the invoice lines 
(offsetting part of the invoiced expense amount with the cash discount) 
3.2.3 
Ledger Integration 
Whenever posting an invoice in purchasing, the invoice automatically posts in 
finance in parallel. The postings in finance refer to two different areas: The general 
ledger on the one hand, and subledgers for accounts payable, sales tax, inventory, 
and others on the other hand. 
3.2.3.1 Subledger and General Ledger 
When posting vendor invoices, credit notes, or payments, Dynamics AX posts 
vendor transactions in accounts payable. In parallel to this subledger posting, 
Dynamics AX posts transactions in the general ledger as described in section 9.4. 
There are two different areas of settings which are relevant for assigning main 
accounts to purchasing transactions: 
 Assignment of products to main accounts – The inventory posting setup (see 
section 9.4.2), which refers to the vendor and the item (or the procurement 
category), contains settings for main accounts applicable when receiving the 
physical product (or service) and the invoice. 
 Assignment of vendors to main accounts – The posting profiles contain 
settings for applicable summary accounts related to the vendor. 
Both assignment dimensions, the item and the vendor dimension, are not only 
available at the level of individual items and vendors, but also at group level. 
3.2.3.2 Settings for Vendor Transactions 
Vendor groups (Accounts payable> Vendors> Vendor groups) are a primary setting for 
vendor transactions. In addition to the ID and the description, you can optionally 
enter a Default tax group (for the input tax) in the vendor group. When creating a 
vendor, the default tax group is the default for the sales tax group of the vendor. 
Vendor posting profiles (Accounts payable> Setup> Vendor posting profiles) control the 
assignment of vendors to summary accounts. As a prerequisite for posting 

60 
3  Purchase Management 
purchase transactions, at least one posting profile has to be specified in your 
company. In addition, the default posting profile for regular purchase transactions 
has to be entered in the accounts payable parameters (Accounts payable> Setup> 
Accounts payable parameters, tab Ledger and sales tax/Posting). 
 
Figure 3-9: 
The vendor posting profiles form 
The Summary account field on the tab Setup in the posting profile contains the main 
accounts used as summary accounts for vendors. The assignment of summary 
accounts is available at three different levels as specified in the Account code: 
 Table – Assigning a summary account to a particular vendor (enter the vendor 
number in the Account/Group number field) 
 Group – Assigning a summary account to a vendor group (enter the vendor 
group in the Account/Group number field) 
 All – Assigning a general summary account (the Account/Group number field 
remains empty) 
If settings are entered at multiple levels, Dynamics AX applies the most 
appropriate setting. The search for this setting starts with the vendor number, the 
specification level “All” has got the lowest priority. 
If you have to use alternative profile settings for special purposes like prepayment, 
you can set up additional posting profiles with account assignments which are 
different from the settings in the default posting profile. In order to apply one of 
the additional posting profiles to a specific transaction, you can choose it in the 
transaction (e.g. for a purchase order on the tab Setup of the header view in the 
purchase order detail form). For prepayment, the posting profile is specified in the 
accounts payable parameters. 

3.3  Product Management in Purchasing 
61 
3.2.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 3.1 – Terms of Payment 
Your company wants to establish new terms of payment “60 days net”, which you 
want to enter in Dynamics AX with a code P-## (## = your user ID). In addition, a 
new cash discount D-## for “14 days with 3 percent discount” is required. 
Be sure to enter the values for due date and cash discount date calculation 
correctly. When registering the cash discount in Dynamics AX, choose main 
accounts similar to the accounts in existing cash discounts. 
Exercise 3.2 – Vendor Record 
The responsible department accepts a new domestic vendor, who wants to ship 
items to your company. Enter a new record for this vendor in Dynamics AX 
without applying a template, including the name (starting with your user ID) and 
a primary address of your choice. Select an appropriate vendor group and a sales 
tax group. For this vendor, the terms of payment and the cash discount entered in 
exercise 3.1 apply. 
Exercise 3.3 – Ledger Integration 
You want to find out about ledger integration. To which summary account in the 
general ledger will an invoice from your new vendor post? 
3.3 
Product Management in Purchasing 
Purchasing includes physical products and intangible goods (e.g. services, fees, 
licenses). For both types of items, you have to ensure correct and complete master 
data in line with the following purposes: 
 Identification – Clearly describe the item to make sure that the vendor ships 
the right product 
 Internal settings – Multiple settings in the item master data control the way the 
particular item works in Dynamics AX 
When purchasing inventoried items, product records (items) are required master 
data. When purchasing intangible goods, you can either use product records 
(including detail data, e.g. prices) or procurement categories (without details). 
Along with a short introduction of the basics in product management, this section 
primarily contains an explanation of the product data necessary for purchasing. A 
more general description of product management is available in section 7.2. 
3.3.1 
Procurement Category 
Product categories are groups of similar products and services, used in a simple or 
a multilevel hierarchy structure. Depending on the hierarchy type, a category 
hierarchy contains procurement categories, sales categories, or other categories. 

62 
3  Purchase Management 
By assigning products to product categories, you can establish a hierarchical 
structure of products. Depending on the requirements, you can set up multiple 
hierarchies in parallel and assign every item to a different category in each 
hierarchy. 
In addition, you can apply product categories for purchasing independently from 
items. If purchasing a service or intangible item not tracked in inventory, you can 
simply enter a product category (instead of an item number) in the purchase order 
line. 
3.3.1.1 Category Hierarchies and Product Categories 
You can access category hierarchies in the list page Product information 
management> Setup> Categories and attributes> Category hierarchies. If you want to set 
up a new hierarchy, click the button New in the action pane and enter a name and a 
description for the new hierarchy. Dynamics AX then shows the category 
hierarchy detail form, where you can enter the categories of the new hierarchy. 
In order to assign a category hierarchy to a hierarchy role, open the form Product 
information management> Setup> Categories and attributes> Category hierarchy role 
association. You can assign a hierarchy to each applicable role (Category hierarchy 
type) in the lines there, including the role “Procurement category hierarchy” for 
purchasing and “Sales category hierarchy” for sales. Depending on your 
requirements, select the same or different hierarchies for the different roles. 
 
Figure 3-10: Editing a product category in the category hierarchy form 
If you want to edit purchasing-related category data for a category used in 
procurement (hierarchy role “Procurement category hierarchy”), open the 
Procurement categories form as described further down this section. 

3.3  Product Management in Purchasing 
63 
If you want to view the structure of an existing hierarchy, click the link in the Name 
field of the particular hierarchy. In the category hierarchy detail form, you can click 
the button Edit in the action pane to edit the structure. 
In order to add a new category or a new category folder, select the parent node in 
the tree structure on the left and click the button New category node in the action 
pane. In the new category, enter at least the Name, the Code, and the Friendly name 
(see Figure 3-10). 
3.3.1.2 Procurement Categories 
Procurement categories are product categories which belong to the hierarchy of the 
type “Procurement category hierarchy”. They are available in the lines of purchase 
transactions (purchase orders, purchase requisitions, purchase agreements), where 
you can select a procurement category instead of a product number. 
You can manage purchasing-related settings of the product categories in the 
procurement categories form (Procurement and sourcing> Procurement categories). An 
important setting there is the item sales tax group on the tab Item sales tax groups. 
As a prerequisite for using procurement categories in purchase transactions, the 
inventory posting setup (see section 9.4.2) has to include settings for the particular 
categories (Inventory management> Setup> Posting> Posting, tab Purchase order, option 
Purchase expenditure for expense). 
3.3.2 
Basic Product Data 
In order to support large multi-company enterprises, the structure of product data 
in Dynamics AX has got two levels: 
 Shared products – Common to all companies 
 Released products – Holding company-specific item data 
The data structure of shared products applies to all implementations. But in a 
small enterprise with only one company, it is possible to manage the products 
directly in the released product form. When creating a new released product there, 
Dynamics AX automatically generates a related shared product in the background. 
3.3.2.1 Shared Products 
The aim of shared product records is to establish a common table containing all 
products (items) of all companies working together in a Dynamics AX database. 
Apart from product number and name/description, shared products do not contain 
extensive information. 
You can access the shared products in the list page Product information management> 
Products> All products and product masters. The all products page shows all items at 
enterprise level, and includes regular products, configurable products, and service 
items. 

64 
3  Purchase Management 
 
Figure 3-11: Selecting an item in the all products list page 
If you want to enter a new product, click the button New in the action pane of the 
all products list page. In the Create product dialog, enter following data: 
 Product type – “Item” for stocked products, “Service” for services 
 Product subtype – “Product” for regular items, “Product master” for 
configurable items with variants (see section 7.2.1) 
 Product number – To be entered manually, if no automatic number applies 
from the number sequence 
 Product name – Short description in system language 
 Search name – Internal text for searching the item 
 Retail category – Categorization in retail business, only if applicable (shows if 
there is a category hierarchy with the role “Retail product hierarchy”) 
 Catch weight – Only set to “Yes” for catch weight items (see section 7.2.1) 
In order to create a regular stocked item, choose the Product type “Item” and the 
Product subtype “Product”. For intangible items (e.g. services), choose the Product 
type “Service”. Alternatively, you can also choose the Product type “Item” for an 
intangible item if linking it to an item model group for non-inventoried items in 
the released product (see section 7.2.1). 
After clicking the button OK in the Create dialog, Dynamics AX shows shared 
product detail form. The detail form then contains further optional settings. 
Apart from the product name and the description in the system language (default 
language specified in the system parameters) entered in the field Description, you 
can enter item descriptions in foreign languages after clicking the button 
PRODUCT/Languages/Translations in the action pane. 

3.3  Product Management in Purchasing 
65 
By clicking the button PRODUCT/Set up/Product categories in the action pane of the 
shared product, you can access the category assignment and link the product to 
categories. Hierarchies are optional if there is the need to create hierarchical 
product structures. 
The button PRODUCT/Set up/Dimension groups in the action pane of the shared 
product form provides access to the inventory dimension assignment. Available 
inventory dimensions are divided into three dimension groups: 
 Product dimension group – Only available for the product subtype “Product 
master”, specifying if there are different configurations, sizes, colors, or styles 
 Storage dimension group – Specifying if the inventory of the item is tracked at 
the level of site, warehouse, location, inventory status, or license plate 
 Tracking dimension group – Specifying if batch or serial numbers apply 
You can leave the dimension groups in the shared product empty. Dimension 
groups not entered in the shared product have to be entered in the related released 
products. You want to specify dimension groups at released product level, if 
different dimension settings per company are required (for example if only one 
company in your enterprise uses locations). 
3.3.2.2 Releasing a Product 
Before you can actually register transactions for a new shared product, you have to 
release it by clicking the button Release products in the action pane of the shared 
product page. The selected product then shows in the Release products wizard. After 
switching to the Select companies page of the wizard, put a checkmark in front of all 
applicable companies. Then confirm the selection by clicking the button Finish on 
the last page. 
If applicable (e.g. in a single-company implementation), you can skip creating a 
shared product and immediately create a new product in the released products 
page by clicking the button New in the action pane. If creating a released product 
this way, the New released product dialog creates a shared product in parallel. 
3.3.2.3 Managing Released Products 
Released products (Product information management> Products> Released products), 
also labeled “Item” in some areas of Dynamics AX, contain the item details. Apart 
from directly accessing the released product form, you can also use the Released 
product maintenance workspace to access the released products. 
In the shared product form, you can access a related released product by clicking 
the link in the Item number field on the right-hand side of the FactBox Released to 
companies (selecting the appropriate company) and then clicking the link in the 
field Item number of the product information dialog. 

66 
3  Purchase Management 
 
Figure 3-12: Released order detail form with the tab Purchase expanded 
After releasing a new product, you have to populate the following mandatory 
fields in the released product from: 
 Item group (tab Manage costs) – Linking main accounts for ledger integration 
 Item model group (tab General) – Specifying item handling and inventory 
valuation 
 Dimension groups (button PRODUCT/Set up/Dimension groups) – Required if 
not specified in the shared product 
 Unit of measure – For purchasing, sales, and inventory 
The default for the inventory unit of measure (tab Manage inventory) is specified in 
the inventory parameters. You can enter other units for sales (tab Sell) and for 
purchasing (tab Purchase) if there is an applicable unit conversion. 
In addition to the mandatory fields, you should enter the Item sales tax group for 
purchasing on the tab Purchase, and for sales on the tab Sell.  
In the field Price on the tab Manage costs, you can enter a base cost price for the item 
as applicable. If the item applies standard cost valuation (according to selected 
item model group), click the button MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in the action 
pane and enter/activate a cost price per site as described in section 7.3.3. 

3.3  Product Management in Purchasing

3.3.2.4 Purchasing Related Data and Default Order Settings  
The tab Purchase in the released product form contains core purchasing 
information, including the item sales tax group already mentioned. The Buyer 
group provides the option to specify the purchasing responsibility for the item. 
The lookup field Approved vendor check method, initialized with a default value from 
the corresponding field in the item model group, controls if you can purchase the 
item only from approved vendors. If you decide to use approved vendors for the 
item (with the option “Warning only” or “Not allowed”), enter allowed vendors 
after clicking the button PURCHASE/Approved vendor/Setup in the action pane. 
Clicking the button PLAN/Order settings/Default order settings in the action pane of 
the released product form provides access to the order settings for the product at 
company level. An important field in the default order setting form is the Default 
order type. If the default order type is “Purchase order”, the item is to be purchased 
from vendors (if no other setting applies from the item coverage). The tab Purchase 
order in the default order settings contains settings which are specific for 
purchasing – including default values for lot size (field Multiple), order quantity 
(field Standard order quantity), and purchase site. Selecting the checkbox Stopped on 
this tab blocks the item for purchase transactions. 
The site specific order settings, accessible by clicking the button PLAN/Order 
settings/Site specific order settings in the released product form, enable overriding the 
default order settings at site level (sites represent subsidiaries within a company as 
described in section 10.1.5). After creating a record with the particular site in the 
site specific order settings, you can enter a default warehouse for purchasing, 
inventory, and sales as applicable. If you want to override the default order 
settings for quantity and lead time, set the slider Override in the site-specific order 
settings to “Yes”. 
When entering an order, default values from the order settings apply (e.g. for the 
order quantity). You can override the default values in the order line afterwards. 
3.3.2.5 Item Coverage 
The primary setting for item coverage is the Default order type in the default order 
settings. On the tab Purchase of the released product detail form, the field Vendor 
determines the main vendor for purchasing the item. 
Coverage groups contain settings for requirements planning (see section 6.3.3). For 
the applicable coverage group, a general default is specified in the master planning 
parameters (Master planning> Setup> Master planning parameters, field General 
coverage group). You can override this default group with a specific coverage group 
for the selected item on the tab Plan of the released product detail form. 
After clicking the button PLAN/Coverage/Item coverage in the action pane of the 
released product form, further settings for the item – including a minimum and a 
maximum quantity – are available in the item coverage form. In addition, the item 

68 
3  Purchase Management 
coverage contains the fields Planned order type (overriding the default order type) 
and Vendor account (overriding the main vendor specified in the released product 
form). Depending on the dimension groups, coverage settings are required at 
inventory dimension level (e.g. per warehouse). 
3.3.3 
Purchase Price Setup 
The base functionality for pricing is the same in purchasing and in sales. Pricing 
includes a multi-stage calculation of prices and discounts, which starts at the base 
price in the released product form and continues with trade agreements for vendor 
groups and individual vendors. 
Since sales uses discount calculation on a larger scale than purchasing in many 
companies, the section below focuses on price calculation. You can find details on 
discount calculation in section 4.3.2. 
Apart from discounts deducted immediately, Dynamics AX also supports vendor 
rebate contracts specifying a discount depending on the purchasing volume in a 
given period (see section 4.9.2). 
3.3.3.1 Base Purchase Price 
The base purchase price is specified in the field Price on the tab Purchase of the 
released product form. This price is the price per purchase unit (field Unit on the 
tab Purchase). The Price unit gives the quantity which is the basis for this price – the 
price unit “100” for example means a price for hundred units (e.g. for screws). 
If you want to record different base purchase prices per site (subsidiary), click the 
button MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in the action pane. In the item price form, 
you can enter and activate a price per site as shown in section 7.3.3 (applying the 
Price type “Purchase price”). 
Purchase order lines apply the base price, if there is no applicable trade agreement 
for the particular vendor and item. Since prices (and price charges) in the released 
product form show in the currency of your company, Dynamics AX converts the 
prices to the currency of the order if the order is in a foreign currency. 
3.3.3.2 Price Charges 
In order to record charges (like fees and freight), which are added to the base price, 
you can optionally enter Price charges on the tab Purchase of the released product. 
If the slider Incl. in unit price is set to “No”, the amount entered in the field Price 
charges adds to the total of an order line independently from the quantity. With this 
setting, purchasing for example 10 units of an item with a Price of USD 3.00 and 
Price charges of USD 1.00 gives a unit price in the purchase order line of USD 3.00 
and a line amount of USD 31.00. The price charges do not show in a separate field 
on printed purchasing documents. 

3.3  Product Management in Purchasing 
69 
If the slider Incl. in unit price is set to “Yes”, Dynamics AX adds the price charges to 
the unit price. In this case, the field Price quantity is the quantity basis for allocating 
the price charges to the unit price. With this setting, purchasing for example 10 
units of an item with a Price of USD 3.00, a Price quantity of 0.00 (or 1.00), and Price 
charges of USD 1.00 gives a unit price in the purchase order line of USD 4.00 and a 
line amount of USD 40.00. 
In addition to the general price charges in the released product form, site-specific 
price charges are available in the item price form (accessible by clicking the button 
MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in the action pane of the released product). 
When working with charges, do not confuse price charges specified in the item 
record (released product form) with charges transactions assigned to charges 
codes, which are managed separately in orders. Details on charges management in 
orders are available in section 4.4.5. 
3.3.3.3 Trade Agreements for Purchase Prices 
Trade agreements give to option to specify more advanced settings on prices and 
discounts. You can view the trade agreements on the purchase prices of a product 
by clicking the button PURCHASE/View/Purchase prices in the action pane of the 
released product form. Trade agreements show following levels: 
 Period of validity – From date and To date, referring to order entry or delivery 
(controlled by the Date type on the tab Prices in the procurement parameters) 
 Quantity – Column From and To (for quantity-dependent prices) 
 Unit of measure – Column Unit 
 Currency – Currency of the price 
 Vendor dimension – Column Account code and Account selection (Individual 
vendor, vendor group, or all vendors) 
In addition to the detail levels mentioned above, trade agreements also include the 
option to specify prices at inventory dimension level. You need this option if prices 
are different per site, or per warehouse, or depending on product dimensions like 
size or color. In order to control the dimension columns displayed in the purchase 
prices form, click the button Inventory/Display dimensions in this form. As a 
prerequisite for using dimensions in pricing, the dimension group of the particular 
item has to include the selected dimensions in the price search (see section 7.2.2). 
The price search runs from the most specific to the general agreement, in other 
words from vendor prices to vendor group prices and finally to general prices. If 
the checkbox Find next in the right-most column of the trade agreements is 
selected, Dynamics AX searches for the lowest price in trade agreements – a lower 
group price overrides a higher vendor-specific price. You can stop this search by 
clearing the checkbox Find next (setting the slider Find next to “No” when entering 
the respective trade agreement journal line). 

70 
3  Purchase Management 
3.3.3.4 Registering New Trade Agreements 
If you want to set up a new purchase price agreement, enter and post a journal in 
the form Procurement and sourcing> Prices and discounts> Trade agreement journals. 
Alternatively, you can access the trade agreement journals by clicking the button 
PURCHASE/Trade agreements/Create trade agreements in the released product. 
 
Figure 3-13: Registering purchase prices in the trade agreement journal lines 
A trade agreement journal consists of a header and at least one line. The lookup 
field Show in the upper pane of the trade agreement journal list page provides the 
option to select whether to view only open journals, or to include posted journals. 
In order to register a new journal, click the button New in the action pane and select 
a journal name. Then click the button Lines to access the journal lines form, where 
you can insert journal lines. When entering a purchase price, make sure the option 
“Price (purch.)” is selected in the column Relation. The Account code determines if 
the price is for a vendor (“Table”), for a vendor price group (“Group”), or for all 
vendors. In a price agreement line, the column Item code has to show the option 
“Table” along with the product number in the Item relation. 
Apart from the fields in the grid on the tab Overview of the journal lines, the tab 
Details contains additional data of the selected record (including validity dates, 
price unit, and lead time). 
When entering an order line, the values for price, price unit, and lead time of the 
applicable trade agreement override the default values from the released product. 

3.3  Product Management in Purchasing 
71 
In order to know the applicable inventory dimensions for pricing, check the 
information text on the tab Overview. In Figure 3-13, this information tells that price 
agreements for the selected item can be entered at site level. You can control which 
dimensions show in the journal lines by clicking the button Inventory/Display 
dimensions in the toolbar of the tab Overview. 
After entering the journal lines, click the button Post in the action pane to activate 
the agreement. 
3.3.3.5 Updating or Deleting Existing Trade Agreements 
In case there is a new price for an item, you would usually just record a new trade 
agreement with the price, the from-date, and the to-date. 
If you want to edit (e.g. update of the to-date of the old agreement) or delete an 
active agreement, open the trade agreement inquiry – for example by clicking the 
button PURCHASE/View/Purchase prices (or the button PURCHASE/Trade agreement/ 
View trade agreements) in the action pane of the released product. After selecting one 
or more trade agreement lines, click the button Edit selected lines in the action pane. 
In the confirmation dialog, select a journal name for the new journal (used for the 
update) and click the button OK. 
The new trade agreement journal contains one line per original trade agreement 
line, which is connected to the original trade agreement. Edit the data in the line(s) 
according to your requirements before clicking the button Post to update the 
agreement. If you want to delete the agreement instead of updating it, click the 
button Select all agreements to be deleted in new trade agreement journal (toolbar on 
the tab Overview) and post the journal. 
3.3.3.6 Required Setup for Pricing 
As a prerequisite for creating trade agreements, you have to set up at least one 
trade agreement journal name (Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Prices and 
discounts> Trade agreement journal names). The column Relation there specifies the 
default value for the column Relation in the agreement journal lines. 
Trade agreements are only used for price calculation, if the appropriate 
combination of levels is activated in the price/discount activation (Procurement and 
sourcing> Setup> Prices and discounts> Activate price/discount). 
If you want to enter prices at group level, you have to set up the required vendor 
price groups (Procurement and sourcing> Prices and discounts> Price/discount groups> 
Vendor price/discount groups, Show “Price group”). In the vendor detail form, select 
the appropriate price group on the tab Purchase order defaults. When selecting a 
vendor in a purchase order, the vendor price group applies as default in the order. 
You can override the price group in the order header afterwards (Procurement and 
sourcing> Purchase orders> All purchase orders, tab Price and discount in the header 
view of the detail form).

3.3.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 3.4 – Procurement Categories 
Your company purchases a new kind of services, for which you want to set up 
appropriate product categories in the procurement category hierarchy. Enter a new 
category node “##-services” containing the categories “##-assembling” and “##-
fees” (## = your user ID). This procurement category applies the item sales tax 
group which refers to the standard tax rate. 
Exercise 3.5 – Product Record 
In order to process purchase orders in the following exercises, you want to set up a 
new product. Enter a new shared product with the product number I-## and the 
name “##-merchandise” (## = your user ID). It should be a regular stocked product 
without variants or serial/batch numbers. You want to track inventory per site and 
warehouse. Choose the appropriate dimension groups in the shared product. 
Then you want to release the product to your test company. In the released 
product, select an appropriate item group for merchandise and an item model 
group with FIFO-valuation. The item does not require approved vendors. 
The item sales tax group for sales and for purchasing should refer to the standard 
tax rate. The unit of measure for the item is “Pieces” in all areas, and the main 
vendor is the vendor of exercise 3.2. The base purchase price and the base cost 
price is USD 50 and the base sales price is USD 100. 
Enter default quantities (Multiple 20, Min. order quantity 40, Standard order quantity 
100) and select the main site for purchasing and sales in the Default order settings. In 
the Site specific order settings, enter the main warehouse of the main site. 
Note: If the number sequence for product numbers is set up for automatic 
numbering, you don’t have to enter a product number. 
Exercise 3.6 – Trade Agreement 
You agree upon a lower price for the new item with your main vendor. Enter a 
trade agreement for the vendor of exercise 3.2, which specifies a purchase price of 
USD 45 for the item of exercise 3.5. There is no minimum quantity and no end date 
for this price. 
3.4 
Purchase Order Management 
An order is a definite promise to deliver goods or services on agreed terms. For 
this reason, purchase orders have to include at least following details: Vendor 
(name, address), commercial terms (currency, payment terms, terms of delivery), 
products (identification, quantity, unit of measure), prices (price, discount), 
delivery date, and delivery address. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
73 
3.4.1 
Basics of Purchase Order Processing 
Apart from manually entering a new purchase order, you can generate it 
automatically from following starting points: 
 Master planning – Generating a planned purchase order which you can firm, 
or immediately an actual purchase order (see section 6.3.4) 
 Purchase requisition – Automatic or manual transfer (see section 3.8.2) 
 Request for quotation – Accepting a quotation (see section 3.8.3) 
 Purchase agreement – Creating a release order (see section 3.8.1) 
 Direct delivery – Purchase order from a sales order (see section 4.8) 
 Subcontracting – Purchase order from a production order (see section 5.7.2) 
 Project – Create a purchase order as item task in the project module 
 Purchase journal – Transfer a purchase order of the type “Journal” 
Planned purchase orders are a result of master planning. Depending on the master 
planning setup (firming time fence), master planning may skip planned orders and 
immediately create purchase orders. 
Purchase requisitions are internal documents requesting to purchase one or more 
items, entered or initiated by the person who wants the item. 
Requests for quotation are required, if you want to obtain and compare quotes 
from multiple vendors. You can create a request for quotation either automatically 
from a purchase requisition or a planned order, or enter it manually. 
Purchase order processing related to projects is part of the project module, 
described in the relevant online help and training documentation. 
Other ways for creating purchase orders in Dynamics AX are automatic transfers 
using an import from external applications or the intercompany functionality 
(purchasing from affiliated companies within a common Dynamics AX database). 
3.4.1.1 Approving and Processing Purchase Orders 
After creating and – if required – approving a purchase order, you can process the 
order from the start to the end as shown in Figure 3-14. 
If change management applies to a purchase order, you have to submit the order 
for approval. Depending on the order and the approval workflow, approval can be 
granted automatically or needs a manual authorization. If change management 
does not apply, the approval status of the order immediately shows “Approved”. 
Once the order is approved, you can optionally post a purchase inquiry if you 
want to process a vendor review. The next – mandatory – step in order processing 
is to confirm the order. Confirming may include sending a hardcopy or electronic 
document to the vendor. 
Depending on the setup, you can skip all subsequent steps of order processing 
except posting the vendor invoice. 

74 
3  Purchase Management 
 
Figure 3-14: Purchase order processing in Dynamics AX 
3.4.1.2 Receipts List and Inventory Registration 
If your warehouse requires a list of purchased items for information purposes and 
for preparing the item arrival, you can print a receipts list. 
Unlike the receipts list, inventory registration as the next step actually updates the 
on-hand quantity in inventory. The inventory registration, which includes all 
required inventory dimensions (depending on the item, e.g. warehouse, serial 
number, or batch number), is an optional step before posting the product receipt. 
Depending on the business processes in your warehouse, there are following 
alternative options to execute the inventory registration: 
 Registration form – Button Update line/Registration (in the toolbar of order lines) 
 Item arrival journal – Posting an arrival journal in inventory 
 Mobile device transactions – If using advanced warehouse management 
If the checkbox Registration requirements is selected in the item model group of the 
purchased product, inventory registration is not optional, but a mandatory step 
before posting the product receipt. 
3.4.1.3 Product Receipt 
When posting the product receipt, Dynamics AX posts inventory transactions and 
– depending on the setup – general ledger transaction. You can access the product 
receipt posting dialog either from the related purchase order, or from the 
appropriate menu item in the procurement module, or from the posted item arrival 
journal in inventory. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
75 
3.4.1.4 Vendor Invoice 
Once you receive the vendor invoice, you can enter it in the purchase order form or 
in the pending vendor invoice form. If applicable, it is not possible to post the 
invoice before obtaining an approval through a workflow.  
An alternative way for recording the vendor invoice is to enter and post it in an 
invoice register and a subsequent invoice approval journal (see section 9.3.3). 
3.4.1.5 Physical and Financial Transactions 
When posting inventory transactions, keep in mind that there are two transaction 
types: Physical and financial transactions. Generally speaking, physical 
transactions are packing slips (product receipts) and financial transactions are 
invoices. You have to distinguish between these transactions, in particular 
regarding inventory valuation and general ledger posting. Details on this topic are 
available in section 7.2.4. 
3.4.2 
Purchase Order Registration 
Like all documents, purchase orders consist of a header and one or more lines. The 
header contains the common data of the order – e.g. the order number, vendor, 
language, currency, and payment terms. Other fields in the order header, for 
example the delivery date, provide a default value for the order lines, where you 
can override them at line level. 
 
Figure 3-15: Structure of purchase orders 
If you change header data after creating order lines, the procurement parameters 
(Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Procurement and sourcing parameters, button 
Update order lines in the toolbar of the tab General) control whether to update 
existing order lines automatically. 
The default value for the Purchase type in the purchase order header derives from 
the Default values setting in the procurement parameters (usually “Purchase order” 
for creating regular purchase orders). You can choose one of the following options 
for the purchase type in the purchase order then: 

76 
3  Purchase Management 
 Purchase order – Regular purchase order 
 Journal – Draft or template, without impact on inventory or finance 
 Returned order – Credit note, see section 3.7 
Order lines include the item number or procurement category, description, 
quantity, price, discount, delivery date, and other data as applicable. When 
ordering a stocked product, you have to select the item number of the released 
product. For non-inventoried items (e.g. services), either enter the item number of 
an intangible item, or skip the item number and select a procurement category. 
When creating a new purchase order header or line, Dynamics AX initializes 
numerous fields with default values from the vendor in the header or the item in a 
line. Depending on your permissions, you can update the content of fields in the 
purchase order subsequently. If you agree with your vendor for example on 
specific payment terms for a particular order, change the terms of payment in the 
order header. If the new payment terms apply to all future orders, you should also 
change the terms of payment in the vendor record for receiving the right default 
value when entering the next order for this vendor. 
3.4.2.1 Entering a New Purchase Order 
Depending on how you want to proceed, there are different starting points for 
creating a purchase order: 
 Vendor form – Preferable, if you search the vendor when creating an order 
 Purchase order preparation workspace – Structured view of approved orders 
 Purchase order form – Preferable, if the vendor is not the primary search key 
(e.g. if looking for all orders not yet approved) 
When starting in the vendor list page (Procurement and sourcing> Vendors> All 
vendors) or the related detail form, you can immediately create a new order by 
clicking the button PROCUREMENT/New/Purchase order in the action pane after 
selecting a vendor. Dynamics AX creates a purchase order header using default 
values from the selected vendor and switches to the lines view in the purchase 
order detail form, where you can enter the first order line. If you are in the vendor 
list page and want to check the existing purchase orders per vendor, click the 
button PROCUREMENT/Related information/Purchase orders/All purchase orders in 
the action pane of the vendor form. After clicking this button, Dynamics AX shows 
the purchase order list page filtered on the selected vendor. 
The Purchase order preparation workspace, which you can access from the 
dashboard, shows an overview of approved orders on tabbed lists in the center. 
Clicking a purchase order number shown as link in the grid opens the related 
purchase order detail form. In the workspace, you can create a new order by 
clicking the button New purchase order in the action pane. The following steps are 
the same as if creating an order from the purchase order list page described below. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
77 
If accessing the purchase order list page through the menu item Procurement and 
sourcing> Purchase orders> All purchase orders, it shows the list of all purchase orders. 
In order to view the details of a purchase order in the list page, click the link in the 
Purchase order field of the particular order. 
If you want to register a new purchase order in the purchase order list page, push 
the shortcut key Alt+N or click the button New in the action pane. In the Create 
purchase order dialog, you have to select a vendor in the Vendor account field. You 
can search the vendor by starting to type the first characters of the vendor number 
(or the name), or by opening the lookup and applying a Grid column filter – e.g. in 
the column Name of the lookup. 
 
Figure 3-16: Creating a new order in the purchase order list page 
After selecting a vendor, the create dialog retrieves various default values from the 
vendor record. Expanding the tabs General and Administration in the create order 
dialog provides access to additional fields of the new order header. If you want to 
change data like the vendor number, purchase type, or currency, you can update 
the particular field in the dialog or – after closing the dialog – in the header view of 
the purchase order detail form. 
After clicking the button OK in the Create purchase order dialog, Dynamics AX 
creates the purchase order header and switches to the purchase order detail form 
showing the lines view. 
3.4.2.2 Purchase Order Lines 
In order to create an order line in the lines view of the purchase order detail form, 
simply click the first line in the lines pane or click the button Add line in the toolbar 

78 
3  Purchase Management 
of the Purchase order lines tab and start selecting an item number (released product) 
or a procurement category. Data from the released product provide default values 
for numerous fields like the quantity, purchase unit, unit price, site, or warehouse. 
If site and warehouse are entered in the order header, they take priority over the 
default values from the item. 
 
Figure 3-17: Updating the delivery date in a purchase order line 
Trade agreements can override the unit price from the released product and 
provide a default for the discount fields (compare section 4.3.2). The calculation of 
the net amount in a line is based upon the quantity, unit price, and discounts. You 
can update the Net amount field manually – Dynamics AX will show an empty unit 
price and discount in this case. 
The Line number is populated automatically when saving the order line. 
Numbering of line numbers applies the Increment specified in the system 
parameters (System administration> Setup> System parameters). 
If you want to view the delivery date and other additional line data, expand the tab 
Line details and switch to the appropriate sub-tab. The delivery date on the sub-tab 
Delivery of the line details receives its default value from the purchase order 
header, if this date is after the lead time of the item. Otherwise, the default for the 
delivery date of the line is the lead time added to the session date. You can specify 
the lead time of an item in the default (and the site-specific) order settings of the 
item, in the purchase price trade agreements, and in the item coverage form. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
79 
3.4.2.3 Inventory Transaction 
When entering a line with an inventoried product in a regular purchase order, 
Dynamics AX creates a related inventory transaction. You can view this transaction 
by clicking the button Inventory/Transactions in the toolbar of the order line. The 
transaction shows the receipt status “Ordered”, and the fields Physical date and 
Financial date are empty. In the course of purchase order processing, posting the 
product receipt and the vendor invoice will update the inventory transaction as 
shown in section 7.2.4. 
3.4.2.4 Intangible Items and Procurement Categories 
If you want to order an intangible item (e.g. a particular service), select the item 
number of a non-inventoried product (item with product type “Service”, or linked 
to an item model group for non-stocked items – see section 7.2.1) and enter the 
order line like you do for regular inventoried items. 
Alternatively, you can skip the item number field in the order line and select a 
procurement category. The procurement category does not include as many details 
as the item record. For this reason, you have to manually enter data including 
quantity, unit, unit price, line text (on the sub-tab General) and other details as 
applicable. 
3.4.2.5 Delivery Address 
You can specify the delivery address for a purchase order on the tab Address in the 
purchase order header view. The default for this delivery address is your company 
address as specified on the tab Addresses in the legal entities form (Organization 
administration> Organization> Legal entities). If a delivery address is specified for the 
site or warehouse entered in the order header, the purchase order retrieves the site 
or warehouse address. 
If you want to change the delivery address in a purchase order, you can choose 
between two options: 
 Select an existing address – If already available in the global address book 
 Insert a new address – If the address is completely new 
If you want to choose an existing address (e.g. a customer address), click the button 
 near the Delivery address field on the Address tab. The Address selection dialog 
then provides the option to select any address from the global address book. 
If you want to enter a completely new address, click the button 
 near the Delivery 
address field. In the New address dialog, enter the address for delivery (similar to 
entering a vendor address, see section 3.2.1) and set the slider One-time to “Yes”. 
If different delivery addresses are required at line level, open the sub-tab Address 
on the Line details tab in the purchase order lines. In the lines, you can choose 
existing addresses or create new addresses (like in the header). 

80 
3  Purchase Management 
Note: If you select the option “Delivery” in the field Purpose of the New address 
dialog and set the slider One-time to “No”, the address is the new main delivery 
address for your company. 
3.4.2.6 Charges and Input Tax 
If an order includes additional costs like freight or insurance, you can use charges 
at order header level or at line level. The functionality of charges in purchasing 
corresponds to charges in sales (see section 4.4.5). In order to access the charges 
referring to an order header, click the button PURCHASE/Charges/Maintain charges 
in the action pane of the purchase order. In order to access the line charges, click 
the button Financials/Maintain charges in the toolbar of the tab Purchase order lines 
after selecting the appropriate order line. 
Input tax (Sales tax/VAT) is based upon the relation of vendor and item: 
 Sales tax group – The vendor record contains the Sales tax group (VAT group) 
distinguishing between domestic and foreign vendors. For companies in the 
European Union, “EU vendors” usually is a third category. 
 Item sales tax group – The item record contains the Item sales tax group (item 
VAT group) distinguishing between items with a regular tax rate and other 
items, for which a reduced rate applies (in many countries for example food). 
Purchase order header and lines retrieve the tax groups from the vendor and the 
item. Based on these groups and related settings, the applicable tax is calculated 
automatically. You can edit the Sales tax group on the tab Setup in the header view. 
It is copied to the lines, where you can access the Sales tax group and the Item sales 
tax group on the sub-tab Setup of the Line details tab. 
In order to view the calculated sales tax in the purchase order form, click the 
button PURCHASE/Tax/Sales tax in the action pane of the purchase order. 
3.4.2.7 Delivery Schedule 
In a purchase order with an item, which you want to receive in multiple deliveries, 
you have to enter multiple order lines with the same item. In order to support 
entering and managing order lines with common commercial conditions (price, 
discounts) but multiple deliveries, you can use the delivery schedule functionality. 
Entering a delivery schedule starts by inserting a regular order line with the total 
quantity of all deliveries. Then click the button Purchase order line/Delivery schedule 
in the toolbar of the order lines. In the Delivery schedule dialog, enter the lines with 
quantity and delivery date for the different deliveries. After clicking the button OK 
in this dialog, Dynamics AX creates additional purchase order lines for the 
deliveries. Only these lines are included in document posting and item availability 
calculation. The column Type in the purchase order lines shows whether an order 
line is the total quantity line or a delivery line. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
81 
3.4.2.8 Header View and Lines View 
When accessing the purchase order detail form, it shows in lines view. At the top 
of the page, a header line below the action pane displays the order number and the 
vendor on the left-hand side, and the order status and the approval status on the 
right-hand side. After expanding the tab Purchase order header in the lines view, it 
shows selected header fields (e.g. the delivery date). 
If you want to access the complete header, click the button Header in the line below 
the action pane of the detail form, or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+H. In order 
to switch from the header view back to the lines view, click the button Lines in the 
line below the action pane or press Ctrl+Shift+L. 
3.4.2.9 Copying a Purchase Order 
As an alternative to manually entering a new purchase order, you can copy an 
existing order. Since the existing order can have a different purchase type, there is 
the option to copy an order of the type “Journal” into an actual order for example. 
 
Figure 3-18: Selecting records in the Copy from other documents dialog 
If you want to copy an order to a new purchase order, start with inserting a new 
order header which should receive the copied records. In the new order, click the 
button PURCHASE ORDER/Copy/From all in the action pane. The Copy from other 
document dialog then displays a list of orders on the tab Purchase orders, and other 
documents for copying on the lower tabs. Select the checkbox in the left-most 

82 
3  Purchase Management 
column as shown in Figure 3-18 to mark the records which you want to copy – 
entire orders in the upper pane, or individual order lines in the lower pane. 
When copying an order, be aware of the slider Delete purchase lines on the tab 
Parameters If this slider is set to “Yes”, all lines of the new order are deleted before 
inserting the copied lines. This does not matter for a new order, but it might be 
unwanted if you just want to copy additional lines to an existing order. 
Once you have finished selecting order headers and lines (lines can refer to 
different headers), close the copy dialog by clicking the button OK. Dynamics AX 
copies the selected lines, depending on the slider Copy order header including 
header data like the payment terms (if copying header data, select one header). 
In addition to the Copy from all button, there is another button for copying in the 
purchase order form – the button PURCHASE ORDER/Copy/From journal. This 
button is useful if there is a purchase order with posted documents like vendor 
invoices, and you want to transfer the posted lines into the order again. 
In addition to the copy buttons in the action pane, the copy features are also 
available as option in the button Purchase order line of the toolbar in the order lines. 
3.4.2.10 Purchase Journal Order 
Purchase orders of the type “Journal” are used as draft or template. It is not 
possible to post a document like an order confirmation or a product receipt for this 
purchase type. Apart from copying a purchase journal to a regular purchase order, 
you can transfer a journal to a purchase order by simply changing the purchase 
type in the order header, or through the periodic activity Procurement and sourcing> 
Purchase orders> Purchase journal> Post purchase journal. 
3.4.2.11 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in purchase order management refer to the browser-based 
user interface with dashboard and workspaces. 
3.4.3 
Change Management and Purchase Order Approval 
Depending on the setting for change management, you have to run through an 
approval workflow after creating a purchase order. 
3.4.3.1 Change Management Settings 
The primary setting for purchase order change management is specified in the 
procurement parameters (Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Procurement and 
sourcing parameters, tab General). Setting the slider Activate change management there 
to “Yes” activates the approval workflow for all future purchase orders. 
If the slider Allow override of settings per vendor in the procurement parameters is set 
to “Yes”, you can enter deviating settings for particular vendors as applicable. 
Setting the slider Override settings in the vendor detail form to “Yes” (field group 
Change management for purchase orders on the tab Purchase order defaults) enables 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
83 
overriding the general setting in both directions: Activating change management 
only for specific vendors while approval is not required in general, or the other 
way around. 
The purchase order approval process is based on the workflow system (see section 
10.4). Procurement workflows are specified in the form Procurement and Sourcing> 
Setup> Procurement and sourcing workflows, where purchase order workflows refer 
to the template “Purchase order workflow” and “Purchase order line workflow”. 
3.4.3.2 Approval Status 
The purchase order header contains the Approval status, displayed in a separate 
column on the purchase order list page. Depending on the approval workflow, a 
purchase order shows the following approval status: 
 Draft – When registering the order, before submitting for approval 
 In review – After submitting, while the order is waiting for approval 
 Rejected – After the reviewer rejects approval (resubmit or recall in this case) 
 Approved – After approval, making it possible to post a confirmation 
 In external review – After posting the purchase inquiry (optional step) 
 Confirmed – After posting the purchase order confirmation 
In addition, the button PURCHASE/Actions/Finalize after posting the invoice 
provides the option to irrevocably close an order, setting the status to “Finalized”. 
This optional last step, which is necessary when working with budget control and 
encumbrances, blocks the order for any changes. 
If change management does not apply to a purchase order, the order immediately 
shows the approval status “Approved” and you can continue order processing by 
confirming the order. 
3.4.3.3 Approval Workflow for Purchase Orders 
If change management applies to a purchase order, the button Workflow shows in 
the action pane and the initial approval status of the order is “Draft”. After 
entering a new order, you have to submit it for approval by clicking the button 
Workflow/Submit. Approval is also required after modifying an order which has 
already been approved. 
After submitting for approval, the approval status changes to “In review” and the 
workflow system starts processing the approval workflow in a batch process. 
Because of this batch process, it is not possible to post the order confirmation for a 
purchase order immediately if change management is active. Even if a workflow 
with automatic approval applies, you have to wait until the workflow system has 
finished the batch process. If manual approval applies, the responsible has to 
decide in the work items assigned to him or his queues (see section 10.4.2) whether 
to approve the purchase order. 

84 
3  Purchase Management 
3.4.3.4 Request Change 
If you want to change a purchase order after approval, click the button 
PURCHASE ORDER/Maintain/Request change in the action pane of the purchase 
order. After finishing the required changes on the purchase order, you have to 
submit the order for approval again. 
When deciding on the approval of a modified order, the responsible can compare 
the current purchase order with the last confirmed version by clicking the button 
MANAGE/History/Compare to recent versions in the action pane. Clicking the button 
MANAGE/History/View purchase order versions provides the option to compare all 
previous versions. 
3.4.4 
Canceling and Deleting Purchase Orders 
There is a difference between canceling and deleting a purchase order; Whereas 
canceling removes the open quantity expected for future product receipt, deleting 
completely eliminates the order line or the entire order. 
In addition, deleting an order is not possible after posting the order confirmation 
or – if change management applies – after approval, whereas you can always 
cancel the order. 
3.4.4.1 Canceling an Order or Order Line 
You should cancel a purchase order line, if you do not expect any further deliveries 
for the line. 
 
Figure 3-19: The dialog to change or cancel a remaining line quantity 
In order to cancel a purchase order line or to change the open line quantity, click 
the button Update line/Deliver remainder in the toolbar of the purchase order lines 
after selecting the appropriate line. Dynamics AX then shows the Update remaining 
quantity dialog, where you can change or cancel the remaining quantity for 
deliveries. If you want to cancel the deliver remainder, click the button Cancel 
quantity in the dialog which sets the deliver remainder to zero. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management 
85 
Clicking the button OK in the dialog adjusts the deliver remainder in the order 
line. If there have been prior partial deliveries, canceling has not got an impact on 
these receipts – you just do not expect any further receipt. 
If you want to cancel all lines of an order, cancel the order lines separately one after 
each other. If the purchase order confirmation has been posted already, you can 
cancel the complete order by clicking the button PURCHASE ORDER/Maintain/ 
Cancel in the action pane of the order form. After canceling all lines, the order 
status shows “Canceled”. 
3.4.4.2 Deleting Purchase Orders and Order Lines 
Unlike canceling, which reduces the open quantity of an order line, deleting a 
purchase order line completely removes it from Dynamics AX. In order to delete a 
purchase order line, select the record and click the button Remove in the toolbar of 
the order lines, or push the shortcut key Alt+F9. 
If you want to delete a complete order, click the button Delete in the action pane at 
the top of the detail form or – after selecting the order header – push the shortcut 
key Alt+F9. 
Once you have posted the order confirmation or submitted approval, it is not 
possible to delete the order completely. If you want to delete an order line in an 
approved order to which change management applies, you have to request a 
change (button PURCHASE ORDER/Maintain/Request change, see section 3.4.3). 
Note: If you want to delete an order line, click the Remove button in the toolbar – 
not the button Delete in the action pane which deletes the complete order. 
3.4.5 
Purchase Inquiry and Order Confirmation 
After entering the purchase order and – if required – finishing the approval 
process, the purchase order shows the approval status “Approved”. In this status, 
you can optionally post the purchase inquiry before posting the required purchase 
order confirmation. 
In case you are using the vendor portal in Dynamics AX, post a Confirmation request 
(instead of the purchase inquiry) for vendor validation on the portal. 
3.4.5.1 Purchase Inquiry 
The purchase inquiry is an optional document, which you can send to the vendor 
for validation purposes. It does not create physical or financial transactions. After 
posting the purchase inquiry, the approval status of the order is “In external 
review”. 
In order to post the purchase inquiry, click the button PURCHASE/Generate/ 
Purchase inquiry in the action pane of the purchase order. In the posting dialog for 
the purchase inquiry, you can select settings for posting and printing as described 
for the purchase order confirmation below. 

86 
3  Purchase Management 
If the vendor wants you to apply changes on the purchase order, you can update 
the order and – if change management applies – approve the changes through the 
approval workflow before posting another purchase inquiry for the same order. 
3.4.5.2 Purchase Order Confirmation 
The purchase order confirmation is a mandatory document, which you have to 
post before you can record the product receipt. In parallel to posting the order 
confirmation, you usually print it (physically or electronically) and send it to the 
vendor. 
Confirming a purchase order means to save it unchanging and separately from the 
current purchase order. The confirmation is an evidence of the document which 
has been sent to the vendor. It does not create physical or financial transactions. 
In order to confirm a purchase order, click the button PURCHASE/Generate/ 
Confirmation in the action pane of the purchase order form after selecting the 
particular order. Alternatively, you can click the button PURCHASE/Actions/ 
Confirm executing the same functionality without showing the posting dialog. 
The option to confirm a purchase order is also available on applicable tabs in the 
tabbed list pane of the Purchase order confirmation workspace and the Purchase order 
preparation workspace. 
3.4.5.3 Posting Dialog for Order Updates 
When posting an update of the purchase order (e.g. a purchase order 
confirmation), the posting dialog shows following options: 
 Parameters / Quantity – “Ordered quantity” is the only option for the purchase 
order confirmation, posting the total quantity of all lines. Additional options are 
available for other transactions (e.g. for the receipts list described later). 
 Parameters / Posting – If set to “Yes”, the order confirmation is posted. If set to 
“No”, the output is a pro forma document. 
 Print options / Print – When selecting multiple orders for a summary update, 
the option “Current” prints documents separately while posting, whereas 
“After” starts printing after the last document has been posted. 
 Print options / Print purchase order – If set to “Yes”, the document is printed. 
Otherwise, posting is without printing (reprinting is possible nevertheless). 
 Print options / Use print management destination – If set to “Yes”, print 
settings specified in the form Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Forms> Form 
setup (button Print management on the tab General) or in the vendor form (button 
GENERAL/Set up/Print management) are used. Otherwise, print settings specified 
by clicking the button Printer setup in the toolbar of the posting dialog apply. 
In order to finally post the document, click the button OK in the posting dialog. If 
the slider for printing in the posting dialog is set to “Yes”, Dynamics AX prints the 
document on a printer or saves a file as specified in the printer selection. 

3.4  Purchase Order Management

Figure 3-20: Selecting to print in the purchase order confirmation dialog 
3.4.5.4 Pro Forma Document 
In the posting dialog, you can select to print a document while setting the slider 
Posting to “No”. Dynamics AX generates a pro forma document in this case. A pro 
forma document, which can be required for purposes like customs declaration, is 
not a posted document. For this reason, it is not possible to reprint or display the 
document independently from the purchase order once printing is finished. 
Another way to generate a pro forma confirmation is to click the button 
PURCHASE/Generate/Pro forma confirmation in the action pane of the purchase 
order. In the posting dialog for pro forma documents, the setting of the slider 
Posting is always “No”. 
3.4.5.5 Summary Update 
Apart from posting a document through the appropriate button in the purchase 
order form, you can run a periodic activity for summary updates. 
The summary order confirmation (Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> 
Purchase order confirmation> Confirm purchase orders) shows the same posting dialog 
as the button for order confirmation in the purchase order. But whereas a filter 
selecting the current order automatically applies when accessing the posting dialog 
from a purchase order, the summary update requires manually entering a filter. 
You can do this by clicking the button Select in the toolbar on the tab Settings of the 
posting dialog, which opens an advanced filter for selecting purchase orders. 
After closing the filter dialog, the selected orders show on the tab Overview of the 
posting dialog. If you do not want to post a particular order listed there, simply 
delete the appropriate line before posting the document by clicking the button OK.

3.4.5.6 Inquiring and Reprinting Purchase Documents 
After posting a document in the purchase order, the posted document is stored 
independently from later amendments in the current order. 
If you want to view the posted purchase order confirmation, open the menu item 
Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> Purchase order confirmation> Purchase 
order confirmations or click the button PURCHASE/Journals/Purchase order 
confirmations in the action pane of the purchase order form. 
If you want to view the posted Purchase inquiry document, click the button 
PURCHASE/Journals/Purchase inquiry in the action pane of the purchase order form. 
 
Figure 3-21: Selecting to reprint in the purchase order confirmation inquiry 
The order confirmation inquiry form shows all posted purchase order 
confirmations on the tab Overview. After selecting an order confirmation header on 
this tab, the tab Lines displays the related order lines. 
If you want to display a print preview of the posted order confirmation, click the 
button Preview/Print/Copy preview or Preview/Print/Original preview in the inquiry 
form. From the preview, you can reprint the document. Alternatively, you can 
print one or more order confirmations directly in the order confirmation inquiry by 
clicking the button Preview/Print/Use print management (printing to the printer 
specified in print management).

In order to avoid processing purchase order approval, make sure change 
management does not apply to your vendor entered in exercise 3.2. 
You want to order your item (entered in exercise 3.5) from your vendor (entered in 
exercise 3.2). Enter the purchase order in the Purchase order preparation workspace. 

3.5  Item Receipt 
89 
Which quantity and which price show in the order line, where do they come from? 
Order two hours of the procurement category “##-assembling” (entered in exercise 
3.4) for a price of USD 100 in a second order line. 
After closing the purchase order from, you want to display all orders referring to 
your vendor. How do you proceed and how many orders display? 
Exercise 3.8 – Order Confirmation 
Post and print the purchase order confirmation for the order which you have 
created in exercise 3.7. Printing should be to a PDF file. 
Then change the quantity in the first order line of exercise 3.7 to 120 units. How do 
you proceed? When posting the order confirmation, display a print preview. 
3.5 
Item Receipt 
Once an ordered item arrives at your warehouse, you want to post an item receipt 
which makes the item available in inventory. 
3.5.1 
Basics of Item Receipts 
The Purchase order receipt and follow-up workspace helps to make sure that required 
items arrive in time. It shows the delayed and pending receipts on the tabbed lists 
in the center and provides fast access to a filtered list of backorder purchase lines. 
Apart from the workspace, there are particular inquiries and reports designed to 
review open purchase order lines. These inquiries include: 
 Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> Purchase order follow-up> Backorder 
purchase lines: List page showing open order lines with a confirmed delivery 
date before or on the To date entered in the filter area of the list page. 
 Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> Purchase order follow-up> Open purchase 
order lines: Inquiry showing all open order lines (use the filter pane, the grid 
column filter, or the advanced filter to select relevant records). 
You can optionally print a receipts list to prepare the expected item receipt. This 
list is just an optional information for the vendor and/or the responsible in your 
warehouse. Independently from the receipts list, the warehouse responsible can 
also use the arrival overview form for viewing and preparing expected receipts. 
Item receipt in inventory then includes two consecutive steps (see Figure 3-22): 
 Inventory registration – You can record the inventory registration, which 
preliminarily increases the on-hand quantity in inventory, directly from the 
order line, or through an item arrival journal, or through mobile device 
transactions in the advanced warehouse management. 
 Product receipt – The product receipt posts the final physical inventory 
transaction and – depending on the setup – general ledger transactions for the 
item receipt. Inventory registration before the product receipt is optional. 

90 
3  Purchase Management 
 
Figure 3-22: Options for processing the item receipt 
Whereas you can execute the inventory registration no matter if the purchase order 
confirmation has been posted before, posting the product receipt requires a prior 
purchase order confirmation. 
Depending on the particular requirements and the setup, it is possible to skip the 
inventory registration and/or the product receipt for a purchase order. If you skip 
posting the product receipt, Dynamics AX will post it when you post the vendor 
invoice. 
3.5.2 
Receipts List 
The way of posting the receipts list is similar to posting the purchase order 
confirmation: If you want to generate a receipts list, you have to access a posting 
dialog for posting and printing. The receipts list is optional, and it does not create 
inventory or financial transactions. 
In order to post and print a receipts list, open the purchase order and click the 
button RECEIVE/Generate/Receipts list in the action pane after selecting the 
appropriate order. Alternatively, you can access the posting dialog for summary 
update (Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> Receiving products> Post receipts 
list) and enter a filter by clicking the button Select. 
The receipts list is not a very common document, but you can use it for 
information purposes regarding an expected item receipt. 
3.5.3 
Inventory Registration 
Inventory registration is a preliminary step before posting the product receipt. The 
options, which are available for inventory registration, are depending on the 
warehouse policy. 
Referring to the required level of detail, Dynamics AX supports two core 
warehouse policies: 

3.5  Item Receipt 
91 
 Basic approach – No pallet management and no detailed tracking of 
transactions within the warehouse required 
 Advanced warehouse management – Detailed planning and tracking of 
warehouse work with pallets or other handling units 
Depending on the warehouse policy, there are following ways for processing the 
inventory registration: 
 Basic approach 
o Registration form – From the order line (e.g. for entering serial numbers) 
o Item arrival journal – In inventory, avoiding the purchase order form 
o Arrival overview – Generating item arrival journals 
 Advanced warehouse management  
o Mobile device – Recording transactions on the mobile devices portal 
Inventory registration is only possible for stocked items (as specified in the item 
model group). The item model group of the purchased item further controls 
whether you have to post registration before posting the product receipt (Inventory 
management> Setup> Inventory> Item model groups, checkbox Registration requirements 
on the tab Inventory policies). 
For order lines containing a procurement category or a non-stocked item, 
inventory registration is not available. You can only post a product receipt for 
these lines. 
This section covers the inventory registration process in the basic approach for 
warehouse management. Section 8.1.2 contains a description on how to process 
item receipts if using the advanced warehouse management. 
3.5.3.1 Registration in a Purchase Order Line 
If it is required to register the item quantity before posting the product receipt, the 
usual way is to post an item arrival journal or – if using advanced warehouse 
management – to register mobile device transactions. 
But you can also record the inventory registration independently from these 
advanced options, for example if you need to split the transaction of a single order 
line into lines with different locations, batch numbers, or serial numbers. 
In order to access the item registration from the purchase order form, click the 
button Update line/Registration in the toolbar of the tab Purchase order lines after 
selecting the appropriate order line. 
The inventory registration form contains two areas: The Transactions tab shows the 
status of the inventory transaction(s) linked to the order line. The Registration lines 
tab is used to post the registration. 
When accessing the inventory registration from a purchase order line, the tab 
Transactions initially shows a single inventory transaction, which has been created 
when entering the order line. This transaction is split into multiple lines if you post 

92 
3  Purchase Management 
partial deliveries, or if you split the line manually. When registering inventory 
dimensions like different batch or serial numbers (if applicable), you can split a 
line by clicking the button Split or Create serial numbers in the toolbar of the tab 
Transactions. 
 
Figure 3-23: Registering a receipt in the inventory registration form 
In order to record and post the inventory registration, insert appropriate lines in 
the tab Registration lines. As an alternative to manually inserting a record by 
clicking the button Add in this tab, you can click the button Add registration line in 
the toolbar of the tab Transactions (see Figure 3-23). 
Before posting the registration by clicking the button Confirm registration on the tab 
Registration lines, you can change the warehouse, the quantity, and applicable 
inventory dimensions as required. In a partial registration, which is recorded by 
entering a smaller than the original quantity on the tab Registration lines before 
posting, the inventory transaction splits into two lines – one for the registered 
quantity, and one for the remaining quantity. 
If you have already started a registration on the tab Registration lines and you want 
to cancel it before posting, click the button Remove all. Clicking this button restores 
the registration as it has been before starting the current registration. 
3.5.3.2 Registration Status 
Once the inventory registration is posted, the recorded quantity shows the status 
“Registered” and is available in inventory. After registration, you can transfer, sell, 
or consume the registered quantity as required in your company. 
The Line quantity form (button GENERAL/Related information/Line quantity in the 
action pane of the order) shows the posted quantity in the column Registered. 

3.5  Item Receipt 
93 
Unlike product receipt and invoice posting, which generate voucher documents 
containing unchanging transactions, inventory registration is a preliminary 
transaction. If you reset an inventory registration, there is no posted transaction of 
the original registration any more. 
The only transaction which you can still view after resetting a registration is the 
posted item arrival journal (if registration has been posted through an item arrival 
journal) or transactions in the advanced warehouse management (if the 
registration has been posted on mobile devices). 
3.5.3.3 Item Arrival Journal 
If it is required to register item receipts in the warehouse separately from posting 
vendor packing slips (product receipts) in the office, you can use item arrival 
journals. Posting an item arrival journal generates the same transactions in 
inventory and in purchasing as the registration directly in the purchase order line. 
You can access the item arrival journals in the form Inventory management> Journal 
entries> Item arrival> Item arrival. Registering and posting an item arrival journal 
works similar to other inventory journals (see section 7.4.2). 
3.5.3.4 Arrival Overview 
The form Inventory management> Inbound orders> Arrival overview provides an 
overview of expected item arrivals. On the tab Arrival options and Arrival query 
details of the form, you can enter filter criteria like the date range of expected 
receipts (Days back, Days forward), the warehouse, or the vendor (Account number). 
Clicking the button Update in the action pane applies the selected criteria. If you 
want to use the same filter criteria repeatedly, click the button Arrival overview 
profiles or New arrival overview profile and create one or more profiles with 
appropriate filter settings. On the tab Arrival options of the arrival overview, you 
can subsequently select an Arrival overview profile name. 
After selecting receipts for arrival (column Select for arrival on the tab Receipts or the 
tab Lines), click the button Start arrival in the toolbar of the tab Receipts. Starting the 
arrival creates – but does not post – an item arrival journal for the selected lines 
with the journal name selected on the tab Arrival options. 
In order to post the arrival journal, open the item arrival journals (Inventory 
management> Journal entries> Item arrival> Item arrival). Alternatively, you can click 
the button Journals/Show arrivals from receipts in the toolbar of the arrival overview 
tab Receipts after selecting the receipt, for which you have started the arrival. 
The button Journals/Product receipt ready journals in the arrival overview shows 
posted arrival journals, for which the product receipt (see section 3.5.4 below) has 
not been posted yet. 

94 
3  Purchase Management 
3.5.3.5 Reversing an Inventory Registration 
In order to reverse (cancel) a registration, which has been posted through an item 
arrival journal or through the registration form, open the registration form in the 
purchase order after selecting the appropriate order line. 
On the tab Transactions of the registration form, click the button Add registration line 
after selecting the particular transaction. Then post the transaction like a regular 
inventory registration, but with a negative quantity. 
3.5.4 
Product Receipt 
Posting the product receipt (vendor packing slip/delivery note) generates the 
physical inventory transaction, which finally receives the item in an unchanging 
voucher document. 
3.5.4.1 Posting Dialog for Product Receipts 
The way to post a product receipt is similar to a purchase order confirmation. You 
can access the posting dialog by clicking the button RECEIVE/Generate/Product 
receipt in the purchase order form after selecting the appropriate order. 
The posting dialog shows the familiar format. The applicable option in the lookup 
field Quantity on the tab Parameters is depending on the prior process: 
 Registered quantity – Select this option, if an inventory registration (item 
arrival) has been posted before posting the product receipt. Dynamics AX 
applies the registered (not yet received) quantity as default for the posting lines. 
 Registered quantity and services – In addition to the registered quantity of 
inventoried items, Dynamics AX applies the ordered quantity for order lines 
referring to product categories and non-inventoried items. 
 Ordered quantity – Dynamics AX applies the total remaining quantity. 
 Receive now quantity – Dynamics AX applies the quantity of the order line 
column Receive now. 
The posting quantity shows in the column Quantity on the tab Lines in the lower 
area of the posting dialog. If required, you can change the quantities there before 
posting. 
The other parameters in the posting dialog are similar to the purchase order 
confirmation parameters (see section 3.4.5), except for the following options: 
 Product receipt – Column on the tab Overview of the posting dialog, in which 
you have to enter the packing slip number of your vendor. 
 Print product receipt – Slider on the tab Parameters of the posting dialog, which 
is usually set to “No” because you probably don’t print your own document 
when receiving the vendor’s packing slip. 
If an exclamation mark (!) shows in front of a product receipt record on the tab 
Overview of the posting dialog, it indicates an issue with posting. A possible reason 

3.5  Item Receipt 
95 
is that the selected quantity in the posting dialog is “Registered quantity”, but 
there has not been an inventory registration before the product receipt. Selecting 
the quantity “Ordered quantity” in the posting dialog usually solves this problem. 
3.5.4.2 Summary Update and Other Options for Posting 
Similar to the option in the purchase order confirmation, the posting dialog for 
product receipts is also available as a periodic activity for summary updates. In the 
posting dialog for summary update (Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> 
Receiving products> Post product receipt), you have to enter a filter by clicking the 
button Select. After closing the filter dialog, you can collect multiple purchase 
orders into one collective product receipt by clicking the button Arrange. More 
information on arranging orders to collective documents is available in section 
4.6.2 of this book. 
An alternative way to access the product receipt posting dialog is available, if an 
item arrival journal (see section 7.4.2) has been posted for the purchase order. In 
this case, you can post the product receipt by clicking the button Functions/Product 
receipt in the action pane of the item arrival journal. If a Packing slip number has 
been entered on the tab Journal header details of the item arrival journal before 
posting, it applies as default value for the Product receipt number in the product 
receipt posting dialog. 
3.5.4.3 Canceling a Product Receipt 
You can cancel a posted product receipt using the Cancel feature in the product 
receipt inquiry form. 
In order to access the product receipt inquiry, click the button RECEIVE/Journals/ 
Product receipt in the action pane of the purchase order form. After selecting the 
appropriate receipt, click the button Cancel in the toolbar of the tab Overview. If you 
just want to reduce the posted quantity, click the button Correct in the product 
receipt inquiry. 
Canceling and correcting a product receipt does not change the original 
transaction, but posts a new transaction offsetting the original one. 
3.5.4.4 Ledger Integration and Settings for Product Receipt Posting 
If ledger integration is activated for the product receipt, Dynamics AX posts 
accrual transactions in the general ledger in parallel to the inventory transactions. 
These ledger transactions are reversed when posting the related invoice. 
There are two relevant settings for posting product receipts to the general ledger: 
 Accounts payable parameters – The slider Post product receipt in ledger on the 
tab General has to be set to “Yes” for enabling ledger posting. 
 Item model group – The checkbox Post physical inventory on the tab Costing 
method & cost recognition in the item model group of the item has to be selected. 

96 
3  Purchase Management 
Independently from the parameter setting, product receipt transactions of items 
with the inventory model “Standard costs” are always posted to the ledger. 
Apart from the setting on ledger integration, the item model group contains two 
more relevant settings for product receipts: The checkbox Registration requirements 
in the item model group controls, if you have to post the inventory registration 
before posting the product receipt. The checkbox Receiving requirements controls, if 
you have to post the product receipt before posting the vendor invoice. 
3.5.4.5 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Since the old “Warehouse Management II” module is not supported in the new 
release, items referring to this functionality (e.g. pallets) have been removed. 
3.5.5 
Partial Delivery and Over/Under Delivery 
You have to post a partial delivery, if you do not receive the entire quantity of a 
purchase order line in one shipment, but split into multiple shipments. In case the 
checkbox Prevent partial delivery on the tab Line details (sub-tab General) of the 
purchase order line is selected, it is not possible to post partial deliveries. 
3.5.5.1 Inventory Registration of Partial Deliveries 
In inventory registration, you can record partial deliveries in the registration form 
as described in section 3.5.3 (compare Figure 3-23). If the inventory registration is 
posted through an item arrival journal, enter the partial quantity in the arrival 
journal lines. When posting the product receipt related to the inventory 
registration afterwards, select the option “Registered quantity” in the quantity 
lookup field of the posting dialog. 
3.5.5.2 Product Receipt of Partial Deliveries 
If you do not use inventory registration, you can optionally enter a Receive now 
quantity in the purchase order line for preparing the partial product receipt. The 
Receive now quantity shows in a column far to the right on the tab Purchase order 
lines of the purchase order form. 
As an alternative to the column in the purchase order lines, you can also enter the 
Receive now quantity on the tab Receive now of the Line quantity form (see Figure 
3-24). In order to access the Line quantity form, click the button GENERAL/Related 
information/Line quantity in the action pane of the purchase order. 
In the quantity lookup field of the product receipt posting dialog, choose the 
option “Receive now quantity” referring to this column then. 
Alternatively, you can skip the Receive now quantity and choose the option 
“Ordered quantity” in the quantity lookup field of the product receipt posting 
dialog. In this case, you have to enter the received quantities in the column 
Quantity on the tab Lines further down the posting dialog. 

3.5  Item Receipt 
97 
 
Figure 3-24: Line quantity form for a purchase order after posting a partial delivery 
After posting a partial delivery, the quantity open for future product receipts 
shows in the column Deliver remainder of the Line quantity form (see Figure 3-24). 
The total quantity received shows in the column Received there. 
When receiving further partial deliveries, you can post the product receipts in the 
same way as described for the first delivery until the total of the received quantity 
equals the ordered quantity. 
3.5.5.3 Processing Under and Over Delivery 
If you post the receipt of a quantity, which is less than the ordered quantity, 
Dynamics AX posts a partial delivery unless you characterize it as under delivery 
(marking the receipt to be the last for the particular order line). For this purpose, 
you can select the checkbox in the column Close for receipt on the tab Lines of the 
posting dialog (see Figure 3-25) after entering the received quantity in the column 
Quantity. 
 
Figure 3-25: Selecting under delivery in the posting dialog for the product receipt 

98 
3  Purchase Management 
As alternative to the under delivery in the product receipt, you can set the open 
quantity to zero by canceling the deliver remainder quantity (see section 3.4.4). But 
unlike the under delivery in the product receipt, canceling the deliver remainder 
does not execute a check whether the missing quantity is in the allowed range for 
the under delivery percentage of the order line. 
A transaction is an over delivery, if the total received quantity exceeds the ordered 
quantity when posting a receipt (inventory registration or product receipt). 
Dynamics AX accepts over delivery, if the exceeding quantity is less than the 
allowed over delivery specified in the over delivery percentage of the order line. 
3.5.5.4 Settings for Under/Over Delivery 
You can only post under or over deliveries, if the slider Accept underdelivery or 
Accept overdelivery on the tab Delivery of the procurement parameters is set to 
“Yes”. In the released product form (Product information management> Products> 
Released products), the maximum percentage for over and for under delivery in 
purchase orders and sales orders is specified on the tabs Purchase and Sell. The 
percentages in the released product are a default for the order lines, where you can 
adjust them in the particular order as needed (tab Line details, sub-tab Delivery). 
3.5.6 
Order Status and Inquiries 
Posting the item receipt updates the inventory quantity and the order status. 
3.5.6.1 Purchase Order Status 
The purchase order list page contains the column Approval status (see section 3.4.3) 
and the column Purchase order status. The header view of the purchase order detail 
form additionally shows the Document status on the tab General. Whereas the order 
status indicates the order progress as given by the lowest status of the purchase 
order lines, the document status shows the highest status of a posted document. 
The order status of a purchase order for this reason may still be “Open order” 
while the document status is “Invoiced” in case of partial deliveries and invoices. 
Table 3-1 below shows an overview of receipt transactions and the related status.

If you click the button GENERAL/Related information/Postings in the action pane of 
the purchase order form, you can access a form showing the last document number 
of posted documents for the particular order. 
At line level, the status shows in the field Line status on the sub-tab General of the 
Line details tab. In addition, the Line quantity form shows the quantity per status. 
3.5.6.2 Inventory Transaction Status 
Both, the inventory registration and the product receipt, change the on-hand 
quantity through inventory transactions. 
When entering a new purchase order line with an inventoried item, Dynamics AX 
creates an inventory transaction with the Receipt status “Ordered”. You can view 
this transaction by clicking the button Inventory/Transactions in the toolbar of the 
tab Purchase order lines. 
When posting an inventory registration, the receipt status of the inventory 
transaction changes to “Registered”. The registration date is stored in the field 
Inventory date, which you can view on the tab General of the Transaction detail form 
(access by clicking the button Transaction details in the inventory transaction). If 
you reverse the inventory registration, Dynamics AX clears the inventory date. 
When posting a product receipt with or without a previous inventory registration, 
the receipt status of the inventory transaction changes to “Received”. The posting 
date of the product receipt shows in the column Physical date of the inventory 
transaction. The Financial date in the inventory transaction remains empty until 
posting the vendor invoice. Additional detail data of the transaction (e.g. the 
packing slip number) show on the tab Updates of the Transaction detail form. 
 
Figure 3-26: Inventory transactions after posting product receipts 
Since reversing a product receipt is only possible by posting an offsetting 
transaction, the physical date of an inventory transaction never changes after 
posting the receipt. 
In case of partial receipts, the original inventory transaction splits into two 
transactions with a different status according to the posted quantities. Figure 3-26 

100 
3  Purchase Management 
for example shows the inventory transactions linked to a purchase order line after 
posting the product receipts of two partial deliveries. 
3.5.6.3 Product Receipt Inquiry 
In order to view the posted product receipts, open the form Procurement and 
sourcing> Purchase orders> Receiving products> Product receipt or click the button 
RECEIVE/ Journals/Product receipt in the action pane of the purchase order form. 
After selecting a product receipt on the tab Overview of the inquiry form, you can 
switch to the tab Lines to view the related receipt lines. The button Inventory/Lot 
transactions in the toolbar of the Lines tab provides an alternative access to the 
inventory transactions. 
3.5.6.4 Ledger Transactions and Transaction Origin 
In case ledger integration is activated for the product receipt, click the button 
LEDGER/Vouchers/Physical voucher in the action pane of the inventory transaction 
inquiry if you want to view related general ledger transactions. In order to view all 
ledger transactions of a complete product receipt, open the product receipt inquiry 
and click the button Vouchers in the toolbar of the tab Overview there. 
 
Figure 3-27: General ledger transactions related to a product receipt 
The main accounts in ledger transactions are depending on the inventory posting 
setup. You can access the inventory posting setup through the menu item Inventory 
management> Setup> Posting> Posting. On the tab Purchase order of this form, the 
options “Cost of purchased materials received” and “Purchase, accrual” determine 
the ledger main accounts which are used in product receipt transactions (see 
section 9.4.2). 
Note: For source documents like the product receipt, settings on the tab Batch 
transfer rules in the general ledger parameters determine, if transactions in 
subledgers are posted synchronously to the general ledger, or if they are 
summarized in a scheduled batch. The general ledger transactions shown for a 
product receipt are depending on this setting. 

3.5  Item Receipt 
101 
 
Figure 3-28: Transaction origin form showing all transactions for a product receipt 
Clicking the button Transaction origin in the action pane of the voucher transactions 
(in a narrow screen, click the button 
 to view all buttons of the action pane) 
opens the transaction origin form, which shows all related transactions in all 
modules. Depending on integration settings, the product receipt posts transactions 
in inventory and in the general ledger. Figure 3-28 for example shows the 
transaction origin of the transaction selected in Figure 3-27. 
3.5.7 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 3.9 – Product Receipt 
Your vendor ships the goods and services ordered in exercise 3.7 with packing slip 
PS309. Before posting the receipt, check following items in the purchase order: 
 Order status and document status  
 Inventory quantity of the ordered item (button Inventory/On-hand) 
 Inventory transaction related to the order line of the product 
Then post a product receipt for the complete order quantity (120 units for the first 
line according to exercise 3.8) with to the vendor packing slip number given above. 
You can post the receipt directly from the purchase order form. 
Now review the status of the points in the list above again. What is different after 
product receipt posting? 
Exercise 3.10 – Partial Delivery 
You want to order your item (entered in exercise 3.5) from your vendor another 
time. Enter a purchase order for 80 units and post the product receipt of packing 
slip PS310 with a partial delivery of 50 units. Then post the product receipt PS311 
of a second partial delivery with 10 units. 
Do you know how to show the remaining quantity? Check the order status, the 
inventory quantity, and the inventory transactions like in exercise 3.9. What is 
different in comparison to exercise 3.9? 

102 
3  Purchase Management 
Exercise 3.11 – Product Receipt Inquiry 
You want to view the product receipt of exercise 3.9. For this purpose, open the 
product receipt inquiry from the appropriate purchase order. In a second step, 
open the product receipt inquiry in the procurement and sourcing menu. Check 
the product receipt header and lines, and try to find out if there are related ledger 
transactions. 
3.6 
Invoice Receipt 
Together with the shipment or at a later time, the vendor submits an invoice. 
Before posting the invoice, you can check it in an invoice matching procedure. 
Whereas the product receipt changes the preliminary (physical) inventory value, 
the invoice receipt changes the actual (financial) value. For this reason, posting an 
invoice receipt does not only increase the open vendor balance, but it also increases 
the financial value in inventory. 
Once all lines of a purchase order are invoiced, purchase order processing is 
completed. Payment of vendor invoices runs through a separate process shown in 
section 9.3.4 of this book. 
3.6.1 
Ways for Processing Vendor Invoices 
Apart from invoices related to a purchase order, there are vendor invoices without 
an order reference. In order to process the different types of invoices, there are 
following ways: 
 Purchase order invoices – Purchase orders and purchase order invoices include 
only lines with products or procurements categories. 
 Invoices without order assignment – Depending on whether you want to 
manually select an offset ledger account, there are two types: 
o Using non-stocked products or procurements categories – Posting is similar 
to purchase order invoice posting, just without purchase order assignment. 
o Using ledger accounts – Register and post an invoice journal, usually for 
specific subjects like office rent or legal services. 
3.6.1.1 Invoice Journal and Vendor Invoice Form 
If you want to enter an invoice with a manual offset ledger account (usually an 
expense account), use the invoice journal. Invoice journals (see section 9.3.3) are 
independent from purchase orders. 
If you don’t want to enter an offset ledger account, use the vendor invoice form 
(Pending vendor invoices) no matter whether the invoice refers to a purchase order 
or not. The invoice lines in the vendor invoice form contain products and 
procurement categories. If the invoice entered in the vendor invoice form does not 
refer to a purchase order, you can only select non-inventoried items and 
procurement categories. 

3.6  Invoice Receipt 
103 
If your company wants to apply approval workflows to pending vendor invoices, 
set up appropriate workflows referring to the template “Vendor invoice workflow” 
or “Vendor invoice line workflow” in the form Accounts payable> Setup> Accounts 
payable workflows. 
3.6.1.2 Purchase Order Invoice 
When recording an invoice referring to a purchase order, there are two options 
depending on approval requirements: 
 Vendor invoice form – Enter and post the invoice in the (pending) vendor 
invoice form, with or without approval workflow. 
 Invoice register journal – As a preceding step to the vendor invoice form, you 
can first post the invoice to interim accounts in the invoice register journal, 
followed by posting in the invoice approval journal (or the invoice pool inquiry) 
from where you access the vendor invoice form (see section 9.3.3). 
If you want to make sure that invoices are approved before posting, you can either 
use the approval workflow functionality in the pending vendor invoices, or the 
invoice register journals. From a financial perspective, the difference between the 
vendor invoice approval workflow and invoice register journal posting is, that the 
invoice register journal already posts an invoice, which is subject to tax calculation, 
when starting the approval process. 
3.6.1.3 Vendor Invoice and Item Receipt 
Vendor invoices related to a purchase order either refer to a previous product 
receipt, or the physical receipt of the items (or services) and the invoice receipt is 
one common step. 
In the vendor invoice form, you can click the button Default from in the action pane. 
If you select the option “Ordered quantity” or “Receive now quantity”, the invoice 
quantity is not based upon the received quantity. Invoice posting then also posts 
the receipt of the exceeding quantity (for any quantity of an invoice line exceeding 
the received quantity of the related order line). If you have not posted the product 
receipt, invoice posting will also receive the complete quantity in inventory as a 
result. 
Invoice posting without a previous product receipt is useful, if you receive goods 
or services together with the invoice and do not post a separate item receipt in the 
warehouse. If you want to post an invoice for an inventoried item this way, the 
item model group assigned to the item may not show a checkmark in the checkbox 
Receiving requirements (see section 7.2.3). 
3.6.2 
Vendor Invoice Posting 
Entering vendor invoices works independently from purchase orders in a separate 
list page – the vendor invoice form (Accounts payable> Invoices> Pending vendor 

104 
3  Purchase Management 
invoices). This form contains all vendor invoices, which have been entered but not 
posted yet. 
In order to access the detail form from the pending vendor invoice list page, click 
the link in the Number (invoice number) field of the particular invoice or click the 
Edit button in the action pane. 
If you want to enter a new pending vendor invoice, there are following ways: 
 Vendor invoice entry workspace 
 Vendor invoice form 
 Vendor form 
 Purchase order form 
The Vendor invoice entry workspace gives and overview of chargeable documents 
(purchase orders and product receipts) and of entered invoices, which have not 
been posted. You can create a pending vendor invoice by clicking the button New 
vendor invoice there. 
If you start in the vendor invoice form, click the button New in the action pane to 
create a new pending invoice. If you rather want to start entering new invoices in 
the vendor form, click the button INVOICE/New/Invoice/Vendor invoice in the action 
pane of this form. 
3.6.2.1 Invoices without Order Reference 
Registering an invoice, which does not refer to a purchase order, is similar to 
entering a purchase order in the purchase order form. After selecting a vendor 
number, the invoice retrieves numerous default values from the vendor record. 
You can view and edit the corresponding fields in the header view. But unlike 
purchase order lines, new lines entered in the lines view of the vendor invoice 
form may only contain non-stocked items and procurement categories. 
When closing the vendor invoice detail form without posting, the invoice is stored 
for later posting (and approval, if applicable) and shows in the pending vendor 
invoices. If you want to cancel registration after starting to enter a new invoice, 
delete the invoice by clicking the button Delete. 
3.6.2.2 Purchase Order Invoices 
If you want to register an invoice which refers to a purchase order, start in the 
pending vendor invoice form (after creating the invoice from the vendor invoice 
entry workspace, or from the vendor form, or from the vendor invoice form) and 
select the vendor number in the field Invoice account. 
Then select the purchase order number in the lookup field Purchase order. If you 
select the order number before selecting a vendor, Dynamics AX automatically 
retrieves the correspondent vendor. 

3.6  Invoice Receipt 
105 
If you are working in the purchase order form, you can also register a vendor 
invoice directly starting there. Clicking the button INVOICE/Generate/ Invoice in the 
action pane of the purchase order form opens the pending vendor invoice form, 
already referring to the selected order. A similar option is available in the Vendor 
invoice entry workspace, where you can click the button Invoice now in tabbed list 
pane after selecting a purchase order or a product receipt. 
Although the vendor invoice form looks different from the other posting dialogs 
(e.g. the product receipt), it shares similar functionality. Like in the other posting 
dialogs, it is depending on the preceding process which option to choose in the 
quantity selection (button Default from in the action pane): 
 Product receipt quantity – Common option, applies if a product receipt has 
been posted before and you want to assign the invoice to the product receipt. 
 Ordered quantity or Receive now quantity – If selected, the product receipt is 
not the default for the column Quantity in the invoice lines. For any quantity not 
yet received, an item receipt is posted in parallel to the invoice. 
 
Figure 3-29: Registering a vendor invoice referring to a purchase order 
If you select the option “Product receipt quantity” in the Default quantity for lines, 
the quantity received not invoiced applies as default value in the column Quantity 
on the tab Lines of the vendor invoice. In order to check the product receipts 
covered by the invoice, click the button Match product receipts in the action pane of 
the vendor invoice form. The match dialog then shows the product receipts 
available for invoicing. Clearing or selecting the checkboxes in the column Match 
there excludes or includes product receipts. If the vendor only invoices a partial 
quantity of a receipt line, you can update the column Product receipt quantity to 
match in the lower pane of the match dialog. After closing the dialog by clicking the 
button OK and clicking “Yes” in the message bar which asks whether to update the 

106 
3  Purchase Management 
invoice quantity (if applicable), the selected product receipt displays in the column 
Product receipt on the tab Lines (“<multiple>”, if assigned to multiple receipts). 
If the vendor invoice is independent from product receipts (e.g. if there is no prior 
item receipt), click the button Default from in the action pane, select the option 
“Ordered quantity”, and adjust the quantities in the invoice lines as applicable. But 
be aware that invoice posting in this case also posts the receipt in inventory for any 
invoice quantity exceeding the received quantity (total quantity, if there is no prior 
product receipt). 
The invoice number (mandatory field Number in the field group Invoice 
identification), the Posting date, the Invoice date, and the Due date (receiving the 
default value from the payment terms calculation) show on the tab Vendor invoice 
header of the lines view. More details are available in the header view, where you 
can set the slider Approved on the tab Approval to “No” if you want to exclude an 
invoice from payment proposals. 
If you want to prevent posting of an invoice (e.g. because of price differences), set 
the slider On hold on the tab General of the vendor invoice header to “No”. 
Before posting the invoice, it is useful to check the FactBox Invoice totals or to click 
the button Totals for comparing the totals on the vendor invoice with the totals you 
are going to post. If necessary, adjust the quantities, prices, discounts, and line 
amounts on the tab Lines or Line details in the lines view of the invoice form. 
Note: After starting to register a vendor invoice, you have to delete it if you do not 
want to save or post it. Simply closing the invoice detail form stores the invoice, 
displaying it in the pending vendor invoices list page. If product receipts are 
assigned to the invoice, you can’t assign them to a second invoice before deleting 
the first pending invoice. 
3.6.2.3 Collective Vendor Invoices 
If a vendor invoice refers to multiple purchase orders, you have to post a collective 
invoice. Entering collective invoices in the vendor invoice form is different from 
registering collective documents for other document types (e.g. collective product 
receipts). 
In the vendor invoice form, click the button 
 on the right-hand side of the field 
Purchase order to access the Retrieve purchase orders dialog. When selecting purchase 
orders in the retrieve dialog, pay attention to the option selected in the button 
Default from in the action pane of the vendor invoice form. The option there 
controls whether you can select a purchase order without a prior product receipt. 
In addition, summary update parameters (Accounts payable> Setup> Summary update 
parameters) and settings at vendor level determine required settings in orders 
collected to a common invoice (similar to accounts receivable, see section 4.6.2). 

3.6  Invoice Receipt 
107 
3.6.2.4 Invoice Matching 
The details entered in the vendor invoice form have to match the received invoice 
exactly. In case the prices, discounts, charges, or other elements in the vendor 
invoice do not match the purchase order or the product receipt, there are 
discrepancies which have to be resolved. 
Depending on the invoice matching setup, the vendor invoice form shows “Failed” 
in the field Match status on the invoice header (and in the column Price match on the 
tab Lines) if the vendor invoice exceeds specified tolerances. In order to view the 
details, click the button REVIEW/Matching/Matching details in the action pane of the 
vendor invoice form. 
Primary settings for invoice matching are available on the tab Invoice validation in 
the accounts payable parameters. Setting the slider Enable invoice matching 
validation to “Yes” activates invoice matching. You can subsequently specify 
different types of invoice matching and different tolerances: 
 Invoice totals matching – Compares only invoice total fields (invoice amount, 
sales tax, charges) with the purchase order. 
 Price and quantity matching 
o Line matching policy – “Two-way matching” compares the invoice price 
and discounts with the order line; “Three-way matching” in addition 
compares the quantity in product receipts. 
o Match price totals – Applies to partial deliveries and invoices, comparing 
the order line with the total of the current invoice line and related partial 
invoice lines already posted. 
 Charges matching – Separate settings for matching charges. 
If allowed in the invoice validation parameters, you can override these validation 
criteria at vendor level or at item level in the forms of the menu folder Accounts 
payable> Invoice matching setup. In addition, business policies (Accounts payable> 
Policy setup) provide the option to specify matching rules which are different from 
the standard invoice validation settings. 
3.6.2.5 Invoice Posting and Ledger Integration 
Once you have finished entering an invoice, you can optionally leave it non-posted 
and post it at a later time – e.g. if an approval workflow applies. Depending on the 
invoice matching setup, you have to click the button Update match status before 
posting the invoice. Once you want to post the pending vendor invoice, click the 
button Post in the action pane of the vendor invoice form. 
After posting, the invoice shows in the open vendor invoices list page (Accounts 
payable> Invoices> Open vendor invoices) which displays all invoices not yet paid. 
Posting a vendor invoice generates general ledger transactions, inventory 
transactions, vendor transactions, and transactions in other subledgers (e.g. sales 
tax if applicable). As shown in section 3.2.3, the vendor posting profile specifies 

108 
3  Purchase Management 
which summary account applies to the vendor transaction. Settings for inventory 
transactions are available in the inventory posting setup – depending on the item 
and the vendor (see section 9.4.2). 
3.6.2.6 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in vendor invoice processing refer to the browser-based user 
interface and include minor changes like deprecating the Cancel option (Remove is 
available). 
3.6.3 
Order Status and Inquiries 
Like posting the product receipt, posting the vendor invoice updates the order 
status and the inventory transactions, vendor transactions, and general ledger 
transactions. 
3.6.3.1 Purchase Order Status and Transaction Status 
Depending on whether you have posted a partial or a complete invoice, the 
purchase order shows following status: 
 Partial invoice – Order status “Received” or “Open order”, document status 
“Invoice” 
 Complete invoice or last partial invoice – Order status “Invoiced”, document 
status “Invoice” 
If you want to view the impact of the vendor invoice on inventory transactions, 
click the button Inventory/Transactions in the toolbar of the tab Purchase order lines 
after selecting the appropriate order line in the purchase order form. 
After posting the invoice, the Receipt status of the inventory transaction is 
“Purchased” and the posting date of the invoice shows in the column Financial date. 
The invoice number shows on the tab Updates of the Transaction detail form (access 
by clicking the button Transaction details in the inventory transaction). 
 
Figure 3-30: Inventory transactions after posting the vendor invoice 
The example in Figure 3-30 shows two inventory transactions referring to a 
purchase order line, of which only one line has been included in invoice posting. 

3.6  Invoice Receipt 
109 
3.6.3.2 Invoice Inquiry 
In order to access the posted invoice, open the form Accounts payable> Inquiries and 
reports> Invoice> Invoice journal or click the button INVOICE/Journals/Invoice in the 
action pane of the purchase order form. 
After selecting an invoice on the tab Overview of the inquiry form, you can switch 
to the tab Lines to view the related invoice lines. The button Inventory/Lot 
transactions on the tab Lines opens the inventory transactions described above. 
3.6.3.3 Ledger Transactions and Transaction Origin 
If you want to view the general ledger transactions related to a vendor invoice, 
click the button Voucher on the tab Overview of the invoice inquiry to access the 
voucher transactions form. Alternatively, you can access the voucher transactions 
from the inventory transaction inquiry (click the button Ledger/Financial voucher 
there), but in this case only the ledger transactions which refer to the particular 
inventory transaction display. 
The voucher transactions form displays all general ledger transactions referring to 
the posted invoice. Figure 3-31 for example shows following transactions: 
 Reversing the packing slip transactions – Accounts 32010 and 10911 
 Vendor summary account transaction – Posting the vendor balance (Account 
33010, specified in the vendor posting profile) 
 Stock account transaction – Posting inventory items (Account 10310, specified 
in the inventory posting setup) 
 Input tax transaction – Posting sales tax (Account 25520, specified in the ledger 
posting group of the sales tax code) 
 
Figure 3-31: General ledger transactions related to a posted vendor invoice 
More information on the vendor posting profile setup is available in section 3.2.3, 
and on the inventory posting setup in section 9.4.2. 
Note: Like for the product receipt, settings on the tab Batch transfer rules in the 
general ledger parameters determine, if vendor invoices are summarized when

posting to the general ledger. In this case, not all described transactions are 
available at the level of an individual invoice. 
Clicking the button Transaction origin in the action pane of the voucher transactions 
(in a narrow screen, click the button 
 to view all buttons of the action pane) 
opens the transaction origin form, which shows related transactions for the 
voucher in all modules. 
 
Figure 3-32: Transaction origin form, showing all transactions for a journal 
Apart from ledger transactions, the transaction origin includes vendor 
transactions, inventory transactions, and tax transactions as applicable. Figure 3-32 
for example shows the transaction origin of the journal line selected in Figure 3-31.

Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 3.12 – Purchase Order Invoice 
Your vendor submits the invoice VI312, which refers to goods and services 
received in exercise 3.9. Before posting the invoice, check following items: 
 Order status and document status of the purchase order 
 Inventory transaction related to the order line of the product (button 
Inventory/Transactions) 
Then register and post the vendor invoice for the received quantity. You want to 
register the invoice in the pending vendor invoices page. Check the invoice total 
and post the invoice. 
Now review the status of the points in the list above again. What is different? 
Exercise 3.13 – Partial Invoice for a Purchase Order 
You receive the invoice VI313, which applies to the goods received with packing 
slip PS310 in exercise 3.10. Post the vendor invoice starting in the purchase order 

3.7  Credit Note and Item Return in Purchasing 
111 
form, making sure that the vendor invoice only contains the items received with 
packing slip PS310. 
Exercise 3.14 – Vendor Invoice Not Related to a Purchase Order 
Your vendor now submits the invoice VI314, which contains a line with one hour 
of the procurement category “##-assembling” (created in exercise 3.4) and a price 
of USD 105. The invoice does not refer to a purchase order. 
You accept this invoice and want to register it in the pending vendor invoices page. 
Check the invoice total before posting the invoice. 
Exercise 3.15 – Invoice Inquiry 
You want to view the invoice of exercise 3.12. For this purpose, open the invoice 
inquiry for the particular order in the purchase order form. As an alternative, 
choose the appropriate menu path. Check the invoice header and lines as well as 
the related ledger transactions. 
In exercise 3.3, you were looking for the summary account for your vendor. Can 
you find the ledger transaction for this account? Finally, open the transaction 
origin form and check, to which modules your invoice has posted. 
3.7 
Credit Note and Item Return in Purchasing 
When receiving a credit note from a supplier, you have to register and post it. 
Posting a vendor credit note is similar to posting a vendor invoice, except that 
credit notes require a negative quantity. Like vendor invoices, vendor credit notes 
are grouped into following types: 
 Credit notes for inventoried items – Returned to the vendor 
 Credit notes for intangible goods – For example services, fees, or licenses 
Vendor credit notes referring to inventoried items have to be registered in the 
purchase order form. When posting a credit note for an inventoried item, 
Dynamics AX also posts an item return (negative receipt) in inventory if no 
separate item return has been posted before. If the item model group does not 
allow a negative physical inventory, posting the return is only possible if the item 
is still on stock. 
Vendor credit notes, which are not related to inventoried items, can be registered 
in the following way: 
 Purchase order – Order lines with non-stocked items (or procurement 
categories) and a negative quantity 
 Pending vendor invoice – Invoice lines with non-stocked items (or 
procurement categories) and a negative quantity 
 Invoice journal – Journal lines with offset ledger accounts (see section 9.3.3) 
In case you have to reverse a product receipt, but not an invoice receipt, use the 
functionality for canceling product receipts (see section 3.5.4). 

112 
3  Purchase Management 
3.7.1 
Crediting Purchase Orders 
For an inventoried item, you have to access the purchase order form if you want to 
post a credit note. If the parameter Safety level of invoiced orders in the procurement 
parameters (Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Procurement and sourcing parameters, 
tab Delivery) is not set to “Locked” (and the approval status of the order is not 
“Finalized”), you can record and post a credit note in the original purchase order. 
Otherwise, you have to enter a new purchase order for the credit note. 
In case invoiced orders are not locked, there are following options to register a 
credit note with an inventoried item: 
 Original purchase order – Registering a new line in the original order 
 New purchase order – Purchase type “Purchase order” or “Returned order” 
3.7.1.1 Credit Note in the Original Purchase Order 
If you want to register a credit note in a new line of the original purchase order, 
access the purchase order in edit mode. Enter a regular order line, but with a 
negative sign in the column Quantity. If you expect a replacement from your 
vendor, you can enter a second purchase order line with a positive quantity for the 
replacement. 
Depending on change management settings, the order may be subject to approval. 
Posting the credit note in the pending vendor invoice form after confirming the 
purchase order works like posting a vendor invoice – after entering the credit note 
number in the invoice number field you can post the credit note by clicking the 
button Post in the action pane of the vendor invoice form. 
If the checkbox Deductions requirement in the item model group of the credited item 
is selected, you have to post a separate – negative – product receipt (item return) 
before posting the credit note (negative invoice). 
3.7.1.2 Returned Order 
If you want to use a new order for the credit note, you can enter a regular purchase 
order (Purchase type “Purchase order”) with lines containing a negative quantity. 
Alternatively, you can select the Purchase type “Returned order” when creating the 
order (field on the tab General in the Create purchase order dialog). If you use the 
purchase type “Returned order”, there are following requirements: 
 RMA number – The return merchandise authorization provided by the vendor 
has to be entered in the RMA number field in the Create purchase order dialog. 
 Quantity – Has to be negative in all order lines. 
 Return action – For information purposes, displayed on the sub-tab Setup of the 
purchase order lines (default value in the procurement parameters). 
In order to facilitate entering the credit note, you can use the Create credit note 
feature by clicking the button PURCHASE/Create/Credit note in the action pane of 

3.7  Credit Note and Item Return in Purchasing 
113 
the purchase order. This feature is also available by clicking the button Purchase 
order line/Credit note in the toolbar of the order lines. 
The credit note feature is similar to the copy feature for purchase orders (see 
section 3.4.2). But unlike the regular copy feature, creating a credit note reverses 
the quantity sign, creates a reservation in the original order line, and applies 
inventory marking (exactly offsetting the inventory value of the original line). 
Depending on whether you add credit note lines to an existing or to a new order, 
you have to pay attention to the checkbox Delete purchase lines in the Create credit 
note dialog. 
3.7.1.3 Inventory Marking 
In order to avoid unintended changes of inventory value, you can apply inventory 
marking to assign the value of the returned/credited item to the corresponding 
original receipt. 
For this purpose, select the new order line (credit note line) in the purchase order 
form and click the button Inventory/Marking in the toolbar of the purchase order 
line. In the marking dialog, select the checkbox in the column Set mark now 
(marking the original order line now returned) and click the button Apply. The 
inventory value of the new line entered for crediting now exactly offsets the 
inventory value received from the original line. 
Without marking, Dynamics AX calculates the outbound inventory value of the 
credit note according to the item model group of the item, for example applying 
the FIFO model. 
3.7.1.4 Transaction Settlement 
In case the original invoice has not been paid and settled yet, you can close the 
open vendor transaction of the original invoice immediately when posting the 
credit note. 
For this purpose, click the button INVOICE/Settle/Open transaction in the action 
pane of the crediting purchase order. In the Settle transaction dialog, select the 
checkbox in the column Mark of the appropriate invoice and click the button OK. 
When posting the credit note, the open vendor transaction of the invoice will be 
closed. 
If you do not settle the invoice when registering the crediting purchase order, the 
responsible has to settle the invoice and the credit note later in the open 
transactions (see section 9.2.5). 
When working with settlements, take into account that there is no manual 
settlement if automatic settlement is selected in the applicable vendor posting 
profile (tab Table restrictions) or in the accounts payable parameters (tab Settlement). 

114 
3  Purchase Management 
3.7.2 
Inventory Valuation with Separate Credit Notes 
If you receive a credit note from a vendor for an item price reduction (e.g. 
refunding depreciation of damaged goods), there is no actual physical return of an 
item. 
3.7.2.1 Crediting and Re-Invoicing 
The easiest way to process such a refund is to register and to post a purchase order 
containing two lines: One line with a negative quantity and the original price 
(credit note) and one line with a positive quantity and the new price (invoice). 
3.7.2.2 Crediting and Allocating Charges 
If this is not suitable, for example if the credited goods have already been shipped, 
you have to post a credit note which does not directly refer to the item. The credit 
amount has to be allocated to the item separately in this case. There are two ways 
to enter this credit note: 
 Vendor invoice form – Entering an invoice line with negative quantity and an 
appropriate purchasing category. 
 Invoice journal – Entering a journal line with negative amount and an 
appropriate ledger account (see section 9.3.3). 
After posting the credit note, you can record a charges transaction to adjust 
inventory valuation if applicable. For this purpose, select the original invoice in the 
invoice inquiry (Accounts payable> Inquiries and reports> Invoice> Invoice journal) and 
click the button Charges/Adjustment in the toolbar on the tab Overview. In the 
Allocate charges dialog, enter a line for the charges transaction then. The lookup 
Charges code in this dialog only shows charges with the Debit type “Item” and the 
Credit type “Ledger account”. You can offset the balance on the credit ledger 
account by choosing a charges code referring to the same ledger account which 
you have used in the credit note. The ledger account on the credit note is either 
determined by the purchasing category (if posting in the vendor invoice form) or 
entered as offset account in the invoice journal. 
Information on the general use of charges is available in section 4.4.5 of this book, 
detailed information on the Allocate charges form in the online help of this form. 
3.7.3 
Case Study Exercise 
Exercise 3.16 – Credit Note 
The goods received in exercise 3.9 show serious defects. You return them to your 
vendor and receive the credit note VC316. The vendor does not send a 
replacement. Which ways do you know for registering the credit note? 
You decide to register the credit note in the original order. Enter the required data 
and post the credit note. 

3.8  Purchase Agreement, Requisition, and Quotation Request 
115 
3.8 
Purchase Agreement, Requisition, and Quotation Request 
Purchase orders are the only documents in procurement which you can use as 
basis for product receipts and vendor invoices. Other documents in purchasing are 
used for business processes which prepare creating a purchase order. 
3.8.1 
Purchase Agreement 
Purchase agreements provide the option to register and to follow up on blanket 
orders. Apart from purchase agreements at the level of product number and 
quantity, there are agreements specifying the total amount per product (and not 
the quantity), and agreements at the level of product categories or vendor totals. 
3.8.1.1 Managing Purchase Agreements 
In order to create a purchase agreement, open the form Procurement and sourcing> 
Purchase agreements> Purchase agreements and click the button New in the action 
pane. When entering an agreement, you have to select a Purchase agreement 
classification in the Create dialog. Agreement classifications (Procurement and 
sourcing> Setup> Purchase agreement classification) are only used for grouping and 
reporting purposes and do not refer to a specific functionality. 
The header field Default commitment in in the dialog determines the level of the 
agreement: 
 Product quantity commitment – Product number and quantity 
 Product value commitment – Product number and value 
 Product category value commitment – Value of a product category 
 Value commitment – Total value for a vendor 
The header fields Effective date (start date of the contract) and the Expiration date 
(end date) on the tab General of the dialog are used as default for the agreement 
lines. After clicking the button OK in the dialog, Dynamics AX creates the purchase 
agreement header and opens the lines view of the purchase agreement detail form. 
In the agreement lines, enter line details including the Item number, Quantity, Unit 
price, and Discount percent (or Net amount and Procurement category, depending on 
the option selected in the Default commitment). If you want to prevent, that the total 
quantity of related release order lines exceeds the quantity in the agreement, set 
the slider Max is enforced on the sub-tab General of the tab Line details to “Yes”. 
Once you have finished entering the agreement lines, you can confirm and print 
the agreement by clicking the button PURCHASE AGREEMENT/Generate/ 
Confirmation in the action pane. In the Confirm purchase agreement dialog, set the 
slider Print report to “Yes” if you want to print the confirmation. In addition, you 
can set the slider Mark agreement as effective to “Yes” if you want to set the Status in 
the agreement header to “Effective”. 

116 
3  Purchase Management 
If the agreement is not set to be effective when posting the confirmation, you have 
to manually change the Status in the agreement header from “On hold” to 
“Effective” before you can generate a release order. 
3.8.1.2 Release Orders 
In order to create a release order in the agreement form, click the button 
PURCHASE AGREEMENT/New/Release order after selecting a purchase agreement. 
Dynamics AX shows the Create release order dialog, where you select items by 
entering the Purchase quantity and the Delivery date for the release order. Clicking 
the button Create in the dialog creates the new release order, which is a regular 
purchase order of the type “Purchase order”. 
Instead of creating a release order in the purchase agreement form, you can start 
by creating a regular order in Purchase order preparation workspace or in the 
purchase order form. On the tab General in the Create purchase order dialog, select 
the appropriate Purchase agreement ID in order to generate a release order assigned 
to the agreement. When entering an order line with an item covered by the 
agreement, Dynamics AX automatically generates a link. 
If you create a new purchase order in the vendor form and there is an applicable 
agreement, a dialog displays which provides the option to select an agreement. 
In the release order, you can post the order confirmation, the product receipt, and 
the vendor invoice like in any other purchase order. When posting the product 
receipt or the invoice, the related purchase agreement updates the order fulfillment 
(lines view in the purchase agreement, sub-tab Fulfillment on the tab Line details). 
If you want to check the link to the purchase agreement in an order line, click the 
button Update line/Purchase agreement/Attached in the toolbar. At header level, click 
the button GENERAL/Related information/Purchase agreement in the action pane. 
3.8.2 
Purchase Requisition 
A purchase requisition is an internal document, asking the purchase department to 
buy requested goods or services. Unlike a planned order, which is created 
automatically based on an item requirement, a purchase requisition has to be 
entered manually. 
3.8.2.1 Prerequisites for Processing Purchase Requisitions 
Before a purchase requisition is transferred to a purchase order, it has to run 
through an approval process. This approval process is based on the workflow 
system (see section 10.4). 
In order to configure the purchase requisition workflow, open the form 
Procurement and Sourcing> Setup> Procurement and sourcing workflows. Workflows for 
purchase requisitions refer to the template “Purchase requisition review” and – if 
necessary for the approval process – “Purchase requisition line review”. 

3.8  Purchase Agreement, Requisition, and Quotation Request 
117 
Products and categories, which are available in purchase requisitions, have to be 
registered and activated in an appropriate procurement catalog (Procurement and 
Sourcing> Catalogs> Procurement catalog). In the purchasing policies (Procurement and 
Sourcing> Setup> Policies> Purchasing policies), make sure that this catalog is selected 
in the policy rule Catalog policy rule of the policy which applies to your 
organization. 
3.8.2.2 Entering a Purchase Requisition 
You can enter purchase requisitions in the list page Procurement and Sourcing> 
Purchase Requisitions> All purchase requisitions. When clicking the button New in the 
action pane, Dynamics AX shows the Create dialog where you should enter a name 
for the requisition before clicking the button OK. Depending on purchasing policy 
settings, you can enter a purchase requisition line on behalf of a different person or 
organization by selecting an appropriate Requester, Buying legal entity, or Receiving 
operating unit. 
The way for entering requisition lines depends on the type of the particular item: 
 Internal catalog items – Choose a regular released product, linked to the 
current procurement catalog, by selecting it in the Item number column. 
 Non-catalog items – Enter services and new products without item number by 
registering a Procurement category and a Product name (description). 
Apart from entering lines by choosing an item number or a procurement category 
directly on the tab Purchase requisition lines, you can click the button Add products in 
the toolbar of the lines. In the related Add products dialog, click the button Add to 
lines in the middle pane after selecting an item which complies with the filter on 
procurement categories in the left pane. Clicking the button OK at the bottom of 
the dialog transfers the items to the requisition lines. 
3.8.2.3 Approval Workflow 
As long as you have not finished entering a purchase requisition, it shows the 
Status “Draft”. Once the purchase requisition is complete, click the button 
Workflow/Submit in the action pane to start the requisition workflow. The 
requisition status switches to “In review” and the workflow system starts 
processing the submitted requisition in a batch process. 
The further approval process is depending on the workflow configuration of the 
purchase requisition workflow. Section 10.4 in this book contains a brief 
description on how to configure and to process workflows. 
As long as a purchase requisition shows the status “In review”, you can create a 
related request for quotation (see section 3.8.3) by clicking the button PURCHASE 
REQUISITION/New/Create request for quotation in the action pane of the purchase 
requisition. 

118 
3  Purchase Management 
3.8.2.4 Creating a Purchase Order 
Once a purchase requisition is approved, it shows the status “Approved” and is 
ready to be released (generating a purchase order). In case purchase requisitions 
are released automatically, Dynamics AX skips the status “Approved” and 
immediately switches to “Closed”. 
In the purchasing policies (Procurement and Sourcing> Setup> Policies> Purchasing 
policies), the policy rule Purchase order creation and demand consolidation (in the policy 
for your organization) determines if purchase orders are generated automatically 
or if they have to be released manually. 
If manual releasing is necessary, click the button RELEASE/New/Purchase order in 
the action pane of the list page Procurement and sourcing> Purchase requisitions> 
Approved purchase requisition processing> Release approved purchase requisitions to 
release an approved purchase requisition to a purchase order. 
3.8.3 
Request for Quotation 
A request for quotation (RFQ) is an external document which asks vendors to 
submit a quotation. One common request for quotation can include multiple 
vendors. Once the quotation from a vendor arrives, register it in a “Request for 
quotation reply” to prepare a comparison of quotes. If you accept a quote, you can 
transfer it to an order. 
3.8.3.1 Entering a Request for Quotation 
You can create a request for quotation manually in the request for quotations form, 
or generate it from planned purchase orders or purchase requisitions. 
 
Figure 3-33: Entering lines in the request for quotation form 
In order to create a new request for quotations, click the button New in the action 
pane of the form Procurement and sourcing> Requests for quotations> All requests for 
quotations. In the Create dialog, choose the Purchase type “Purchase order” for a 

3.8  Purchase Agreement, Requisition, and Quotation Request 
119 
request referring to a regular purchase order. After entering the delivery date and 
the expiration date, close the dialog by clicking the button OK. 
Requests for quotation consist of a header and one or more lines. The header 
contains common data like the language and the quotation deadline (Expiration 
date). The lines contain the items with quantity and price. Both, header and lines, 
include the fields Lowest status and Highest status showing the status (“Created”, 
“Sent”, “Accepted”, or “Rejected”) of the request and related quotations. 
Like in the lines of purchase requisitions or purchase orders, a line in the request 
for quotation either refers to an item number or to a procurement category. In the 
request for quotation form, the column Line type controls whether the line contains 
an item or a procurement category. Data like delivery date and address in the lines 
retrieve a default value from the header. By use of the document management (see 
section 10.5.1) you can add details like data sheets or drawings to the request 
header or lines. 
In order to specify the vendors receiving the request for quotation, switch to the 
tab Vendor in the header view and insert a line for each vendor. 
3.8.3.2 Sending the Request to Vendors 
After entering the appropriate vendors, click the button QUOTATION/Process/Send 
in the action pane which opens the posting dialog for sending the request. If you 
want to print the request, click the button Print in the toolbar of the posting dialog 
and set the slider Print request for quotation to “Yes”. Then click the button OK in the 
posting dialog to post and print the request. 
In order to view to which vendors you have sent the request for quotation, you can 
click the button QUOTATION/Journals/Request for quotation journals in the action 
pane of the request for quotation form afterwards. 
3.8.3.3 Request for Quotation Reply 
In the action pane of the request for quotation form, you can click the button 
QUOTATION/Replies/Set RFQ reply defaults to specify the fields to be included in a 
reply. These fields show on the RFQ reply sheet, which you can print when 
sending the request for quotation (choose the appropriate slider setting in the 
printing options). The default for the reply field settings is specified in the 
procurement parameters (Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Procurement and 
sourcing parameters, button Default request for quotation reply fields on the tab Request 
for quotation). 
Once a vendor replies to a request by sending a quotation, register the quotation 
(reply) in the form Procurement and sourcing> Requests for quotations> Requests for 
quotations follow-up> Request for quotation replies. Alternatively, you can access the 
replies by clicking the button QUOTATION/Replies/Enter reply in the action pane of 
the request for quotation form. If accessing the reply form this way, make sure to 

120 
3  Purchase Management 
edit the reply of the right vendor – click the button 
 (Show/Hide list) to display 
the navigation list pane for this purpose. 
In the reply form, enter details of the vendor quote on the tab Quotation (for header 
data) and on the tab Purchase quotation lines (for lines data). In order to support 
data input, you can click the button REPLY/Process/Copy data to reply to copy data 
from the request into the reply fields. 
Once you have finished entering the reply, the highest/lowest status of the request 
and the reply show the status “Received”. 
3.8.3.4 Approving and Rejecting Vendor Quotations 
If you want to compare the different replies (quotes) from your vendors, click the 
button QUOTATION/Replies/Compare replies in the action pane of the request for 
quotation form to access the Compare request for quotation replies form. 
In the compare form, you can accept a quotation by selecting the checkbox in the 
column Mark and clicking the button Accept in the action pane. Alternatively, you 
can accept a quotation in the request reply form (button REPLY/Process/Accept). 
When posting the acceptance, Dynamics AX automatically creates a purchase 
order. If you accept all lines of a request, Dynamics AX suggests to reject the other 
replies for the request. Alternatively, you can reject a request by clicking the button 
REPLY/Process/Reject in the reply. 
3.8.4 
Case Study Exercise 
Exercise 3.17 – Request for Quotation 
You want to receive vendor quotations for your item. For this purpose, enter a new 
request in the request for quotations form. This request should contain a line with 
the item entered in exercise 3.5. The RFQ reply defaults for the request should 
include the header field Reply valid to and the line fields Quantity and Unit price. 
You want to send the request to your vendor of exercise 3.2 and another vendor of 
your choice. Once you have finished entering the request, choose the option Send 
in order to post and print the RFQ for these vendors. 
After a while, you receive quotes with quantities and prices of your choice from 
both vendors. In order to track the quotes, enter them as request for quotation 
replies assigned to the original request. Your vendor of exercise 3.2 has submitted 
the better quote, which you want to accept transferring the RFQ reply to a 
purchase order. Then send a quote rejection to the other vendor.

Sales and Distribution 
The primary responsibility of sales and distribution is to provide customers with 
goods and services. In order to perform this task, sales and distribution processes 
sales orders from the start (entering the order) through picking and shipping until 
the end (sending the invoice to the customer). 
4.1 
Business Processes in Sales and Distribution 
Before we start to go into details, the lines below give an overview of the business 
processes in sales and distribution. 
4.1.1 
Basic Approach 
Starting point for sales and distribution are correct master data, in particular the 
data on customers and products. When selling services or non-inventoried items, 
you can use sales categories instead of products. 
4.1.1.1 Master Data and Transactions in Sales 
Customer and product records are master data, only occasionally updated after 
initially creating the individual records. In the course of sales order processing, 
sales quotations and sales orders (transaction data) receive default values from 
customer and product records (master data). You can override the data in 
transactions, for example if your customer requires a different delivery address in 
a particular sales order. If such an update should also apply to future orders, you 
have to modify the customer record accordingly. 
Since the sales process is mirroring the purchasing process, sales order processing 
is very similar to purchase order processing. Figure 4-1 shows the primary steps of 
sales order processing (including required predecessor and successor activities).

122 
4  Sales and Distribution 
4.1.1.2 Sales Quotation 
If we disregard prior marketing activities, sales order processing starts with a 
request from a prospect or customer. Answering this request, the sales team creates 
a quote and sends it to the potential or actual customer. Based on the sales 
quotation, Dynamics AX can generate activities for following up on the quotation. 
4.1.1.3 Sales Order 
If the customer agrees to the proposal and orders the goods or services, you have 
to create a sales order as the basis for order fulfillment. Like a purchase order, a 
sales order consists of a header, which primarily contains customer data, and one 
or more lines, which contain the ordered items (products or sales categories). 
Optionally, you can post an order confirmation and send it to the customer 
electronically or as printed document. Posting the order confirmation stores the 
confirmation. The order confirmation is available with its original content 
afterwards, no matter if there is a later modification on the actual sales order. 
In order to manage long-term contracts (blanket orders), you can use sales 
agreements in Dynamics AX. If you want to issue a shipment related to the blanket 
order later, create a release order with a partial quantity of the sales agreement. 
Release orders are regular sales orders which are assigned to the agreement. 
4.1.1.4 Delivery Management 
Depending on the settings of the item, master planning takes care of the material 
supply (through purchasing or production) and makes sure that you can ship the 
sales order in time. 
Before shipping the item, you can print a picking list to prepare delivery. After 
finishing the internal shipment procedure, you can post the packing slip. Posting a 
packing slip without a prior picking list is possible, if your company does not need 
picking lists. 
4.1.1.5 Invoicing 
Once the packing slip is posted, you can post invoice for the sales order. If you do 
not require a separate packing slip, you can also post the invoice without a prior 
packing slip. In this case, the invoice posts the physical and the financial 
transactions in parallel. 
If you want to sell services or non-inventoried items, you can process a regular 
sales order (enter order lines with sales categories or service items). Alternatively, 
you can use a free text invoice in case you just need an invoice and no other sales 
document. In the lines of a free text invoice, you have to enter ledger main 
accounts instead of products or sales categories. 

4.1  Business Processes in Sales and Distribution 
123 
4.1.1.6 Customer Payment 
Before the due date, your customer has to pay the invoice with or without cash 
discount deduction. Section 9.3.4 contains a description on how to post the 
customer payment and to settle the invoice in the customer transactions. 
If the customer does not pay in time, you can create payment reminders in 
Dynamics AX. 
4.1.1.7 Ledger Integration and Voucher Principle 
Because of the deep finance integration in Dynamics AX, all inventory and 
customer transactions in sales are posted to ledger accounts specified in the setup 
as described in section 9.4. 
In order to keep track of the whole business process, Dynamics AX 
comprehensively applies the voucher principle which means that you have to 
register a document (voucher) before posting the transaction. The transactions in 
sales order processing are similar to the respective purchasing process 
transactions. 
For your guidance, Figure 4-2 below shows a comparison of purchase and sales 
documents in order processing.

4.1.2 
At a Glance: Sales Order Processing 
In order to provide an overview of the main steps in sales order processing, this 
section shows the basics. In the example, we create an order starting in the Sales 
order processing and inquiry workspace and post all transactions directly in the sales 
order form. Of course you can also create the order from the customer form, or 
directly in the sales orders list page. 
In the Sales order processing and inquiry workspace, which you can access from the 
dashboard or from the Workspaces folder of the Sales and marketing menu, click the 
button New/Sales order in the action pane. The Create sales order dialog shows next, 
where you have to select a customer in the Customer account field (you can trigger 
the search there by starting to type the first characters of the customer name). 
Clicking the button OK in the dialog creates a sales order header with default data 
like language or currency from the selected customer. 
The sales order detail form then opens in lines view. If you are in view mode, 
switch to the edit mode by clicking the button Edit or by pressing the F2 key. On 
the tab Sales order lines, you can start to enter an order line with item number (or 
sales category), quantity, and price. When selecting the item, Dynamics AX 
initializes the quantity, the price, and other fields like the site with default values. 
If you want to enter a second line, press the Down Arrow on the keyboard or click 
the button Add line in the toolbar. Clicking the button Header (or Lines) below the 
action pane switches between the header view (see Figure 4-3) and the lines view. 
 
Figure 4-3: 
Entering header data in the sales order header view 

4.1  Business Processes in Sales and Distribution 
125 
Note: If the sales order contains only one line, you might need to press the shortcut 
Shift+F5 to refresh the form before you can post the order confirmation next. 
If you want to print the order confirmation, post it by clicking the button SELL/ 
Generate/Confirm sales order in the action pane. In the posting dialog, make sure that 
the sliders Posting and Print confirmation on the tab Parameters are set to “Yes” and 
optionally click the button Printer setup to select a printer (compare section 2.2.1). 
In order to post the packing slip in the sales order form, click the button PICK AND 
PACK/Generate/Post packing slip in the action pane of the order form. In the posting 
dialog, choose the option “All” in the field Quantity to ship the entire quantity. 
After making sure the sliders Posting and Print packing slip are set to “Yes”, click 
the button OK to post and print the packing slip. Packing slip posting reduces the 
physical quantity in inventory and sets the order status to “Delivered”. 
 
Figure 4-4: 
Posting the packing slip in the sales order 
Posting the sales invoice by clicking the button INVOICE/Generate/Invoice in the 
sales order form is similar to packing slip posting. In order to invoice only shipped 
items, make sure to choose the option “Packing slip” in the lookup field Quantity of 
the posting dialog. If you select the option “All”, invoice posting in parallel ships 
the deliver remainder quantity (open quantity, which is not included in prior 
packing slips). Invoice posting generates an open customer transaction to be paid 
and updates the order status to “Invoiced”. 
If applicable, you can skip transactions in the process described above. The most 
streamlined process is to post the invoice immediately after entering the sales 
order (selecting “All” in the Quantity field of the invoice posting dialog).

4.2 
Customer Management 
Business partners, who receive goods or services, have to be entered as customers 
in Dynamics AX. As long as the business partner only receives quotations, you can 
also use a prospect record. 
Customer records in sales mirror vendor records in purchasing. In both areas there 
are list pages and detail forms with similar features. Examples are one-time 
customers, payment terms, cash discounts, posting profiles, and the global address 
book integration. 
4.2.1 
Core Data and Comparison to Vendor Records 
In order to edit existing or to create new customers, open the customer list page in 
the sales module (Sales and marketing> Customers> All customers) or in the accounts 
receivable module (Accounts receivable> Customers> All customers). According to the 
general structure of list pages, the customer page shows a list of all customers. If 
you want to view the details of a customer in the list page, click the link in the 
Account field of the particular customer. 
Apart from the customer list page, the Sales order processing and inquiry workspace 
also provides access to the customer detail form (list Find customer in the tabbed list 
pane). 
4.2.1.1 Create New Customer Dialog 
If you want to create a new customer in the customer page, click the button New in 
the action pane or press the shortcut Alt+N to access the Create new customer dialog. 
In the Create dialog, which contains all core fields of the customer record, select the 
appropriate Type (“Person” or “Organization”) first. The field Name in the dialog is 
a lookup providing the option either to enter a new name or – if the customer is 
already a party in the global address book – to select an existing party. 
Customer records are linked to the global address book in the same way as vendor 
records, which is why features like the duplicate check work as described for 
vendors (see section 3.2.1). 
If you want to create a sales order immediately after creating the customer, you can 
click the button Save and open/Sales order in the dialog. 
4.2.1.2 Customer Detail Form 
In the customer detail form, you can switch to the edit mode by clicking the button 
Edit in the action pane or by pressing the F2 key. If you are in edit mode in the list 
page and access the detail form afterwards, the detail form will open in edit mode. 
The customer form contains numerous fields, which represent default values for 
sales orders. Like the vendor group in vendor records, the Customer group in 
customer records is a core setting which controls ledger integration through 
customer posting profiles (compare section 3.2.3). Further important fields include 

4.2  Customer Management 
127 
the Sales tax group (VAT group) and the Delivery terms on the tab Invoice and 
delivery, the Currency on the tab Sales demographics, the Terms of payment on the tab 
Payment defaults, and settings for blocking (lookup field Invoice and delivery on hold 
on the tab Credit and collections). 
 
Figure 4-5: 
Editing a customer in the customer detail form 
Since the structure and the content of the fields in the customer record are very 
similar to the vendor record, the description below only covers deviations and 
elements, which primarily refer to customer records and which have not been 
explained for vendor records. 
4.2.1.3 Invoice Account 
Sometimes it is necessary to send an invoice to a customer, who is not the order 
customer – for example if the head office of an affiliated group should receive the 
invoice for subsidiaries. In order to comply with this situation, select the customer 
number of the invoice customer in the field Invoice account on the tab Invoice and 
delivery. A customer number entered there is the default value for the field Invoice 
account in related sales order headers. If required, you can override the invoice 
account in the sales order. 
Invoices of applicable orders contain the invoice customer instead of the order 
customer, generating an open customer transaction referring to the customer 
number of the invoice account. Unless chosen differently in the lookup field Invoice 
address on the tab Invoice and delivery of the customer record, the printed invoice 
shows the address of the invoice account. 

128 
4  Sales and Distribution 
4.2.1.4 Alternative Address and Global Address Book Integration 
Whereas the invoice account number in the customer form refers to a second 
customer number (assigning a separate customer record), the customer addresses 
on the tab Addresses of the customer form provide the option to assign multiple 
postal addresses to a single customer number. 
 
Figure 4-6: 
Editing a customer delivery address in the address dialog 
Like the postal addresses for vendors (see section 3.2.1), customer addresses are 
shared with the related party in the global address book.  
After clicking the button Add in the toolbar of the tab Addresses, the address dialog 
displays where you enter the address name and select one or more purposes. For 
the primary customer address, set the slider Primary to “Yes”. 
If entering an address with the purpose “Invoice”, invoices for the customer show 
this address instead of the primary address. An address with the purpose 
“Delivery” is the default for the delivery address in sales orders. If you want to 
ship to an address, which is different from the delivery address or the primary 
address (default if there is no specific delivery address), select one of the other 
customer addresses or enter a completely new address in the sales order. 
4.2.1.5 Print Management 
Base settings for printing options like the destination (printer), the number of 
copies, or the footer text are available in the accounts receivable print management 

4.2  Customer Management 
129 
setup (Accounts receivable> Setup> Forms> Form setup, button Print management in the 
toolbar of the tab General). 
You can override these settings in the print management at customer level (button 
GENERAL/Set up/Print management in the customer form). After selecting the 
appropriate original or copy document in the left pane of the print management 
form, choose the option Override in the context menu (which opens by a right-hand 
click) before entering the individual settings. Customer print management settings 
are transferred to sales orders, where you can override them at order level again. 
Print management settings (e.g. a specified printer) apply to documents, if the 
slider Use print management destination in the particular posting dialog is set to 
“Yes” (compare section 3.4.5). 
4.2.1.6 Credit Limit 
Many companies want to apply credit limits to customers in sales. For this 
purpose, the accounts receivable parameters (Accounts receivable> Setup> Account 
receivable parameters, tab Credit rating) contain settings which control the usage of 
credit limits. Depending on these settings, the credit limit check includes only 
unpaid invoices, or also open packing slips, or additionally open orders, and 
shows a warning or an error message. 
The tab Credit and collections in the customer form contains the field Credit limit 
where you can enter the credit limit amount of the customer. If the slider 
Mandatory credit limit is set to “Yes”, the credit limit amount applies always. 
Otherwise, a credit limit amount of zero means unlimited credit. 
When you enter (or post, depending on the parameter settings) a sales order, 
Dynamics AX checks if the customer exceeds the credit limit and either displays an 
error message (which prevents posting) or a warning. 
4.2.1.7 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in customer management refer to the browser-based user 
interface. The shipping carrier interface is deprecated. 
4.2.2 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 4.1 – Customer Record 
A new domestic customer wants to order your items. Create a record for this 
customer containing the name (starting with our user ID), primary address, and an 
appropriate customer and sales tax group for domestic customers. In addition, the 
terms of payment and the cash discount entered in exercise 3.1 apply. 
The customer wants you to ship ordered goods to a separate delivery address. 
Enter a domestic delivery address of your choice for this purpose, which should be 
the default for orders of this customer.

Exercise 4.2 – Ledger Integration 
You want to find out about ledger integration. To which summary account in the 
general ledger will an invoice for your new customer post? 
4.3 
Product Management in Sales 
Apart from customer records (which are the main data source for sales order 
headers), products and sales categories (applying to order lines) are the second 
core area of master data for sales operations. 
Product and released product records are required for inventoried items. For 
intangible items (e.g. services, fees, licenses), you can either use item records (with 
the product type “Service” or a specific item model group) or sales categories. 
The following section primarily contains an explanation of data in the product 
record which are necessary for sales and distribution. A more general description 
of product management is available in section 7.2. 
4.3.1 
Product Data and Sales Category 
When entering a sales order line, you have to select either an item number or a 
sales category to identify the item or service which you are selling. 
4.3.1.1 Sales Category 
A product category (see section 3.3.1) is a group of similar products or services. 
You can access the product categories in the category hierarchy form (Product 
information management> Setup> Categories and attributes> Category hierarchies). 
Sales categories are product categories which belong to the hierarchy of the type 
“Sales category hierarchy”. You can manage sales-related settings of these product 
categories in the sales categories form (Sales and marketing> Setup> Categories> Sales 
categories). An important setting there is the item sales tax group on the tab Item 
sales tax groups. 
4.3.1.2 Creating a Product 
The product record structure in Dynamics AX shows two levels, with the shared 
products containing data which are common to all companies, and the released 
products containing company-specific data (see section 3.3.2 and 7.2.1). You can 
access shared products in the form Product information management> Products> All 
products and product masters. Most sales specific data are included in the released 
product form (Product information management> Products> Released products). 
In order to create a new product, open the shared product form and insert a record 
by clicking the button New in the action pane. After closing the Create dialog and 
entering shared product data as applicable, click the button Release products in the 
action pane of the shared product. In the released product, you have to enter at 

4.3  Product Management in Sales 
131 
least the item group, the item model group, and– if not specified in the shared 
product – the dimension groups. 
As an alternative to creating a shared product and releasing it, you can create a 
released product directly in the released product form by clicking the button New 
in the action pane there. In this case, the New released product dialog creates a 
shared product in parallel. 
4.3.1.3 Sales Related Data 
Core sales data, including the Item sales tax group (specifying whether regular sales 
tax / VAT or a reduced rate applies), are available on the tab Sell of the released 
product form. 
After clicking the button MANAGE INVENTORY/Order settings/Default order 
settings in the released product, you can enter settings for order quantities and lot 
sizes at company level. In order to access the site-specific settings, click the button 
MANAGE INVENTORY/Order settings/Site specific order settings in the released 
product. If you want to enter quantity settings in the site-specific order settings, set 
the slider Override to “Yes”. 
Both order setting forms contain data for purchasing, sales, and inventory. Sales-
related data show on the tab Sales order. Selecting the checkbox Stopped there blocks 
the product for sales transactions. 
4.3.2 
Sales Price and Discount Setup 
In addition to the base sales price, which you can enter directly in the released 
product form, trade agreements provide the option to manage multiple price lists 
and discount agreements. 
4.3.2.1 Base Sales Prices 
The base sales price shows on the tab Sell of the released product form. 
Dynamics AX can automatically update this price based upon the purchase price 
or the cost price. The field group Price update of the tab Sell contains settings for this 
price calculation, including the lookup field Base price which provides two options: 
 Purchase price – Sales price based on the base purchase price (tab Purchase) 
 Cost – Sales price based on the base cost price (tab Manage costs) 
The Sales price model specifies, if the price calculation refers to the field Contribution 
ratio or to the field Charges percentage. The Sales price model “None” means that there 
is no automatic calculation of the base sales price. 
The other settings related to the base sales price (including price unit and price 
charges) are similar to the base purchase price settings (see section 3.3.3). 
In addition to the base sales price on the tab Sell of the released product form, base 
prices are available at site level in the item price form. In order to access the item 
price form, click the button MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in the released 

132 
4  Sales and Distribution 
product. For manufactured items you can run a calculation of sales prices in the 
item price form based upon the bill of materials and the route (See section 7.3.3). 
4.3.2.2 Discount Groups 
Apart from the Base sales price, the tab Sell in the released product form also 
contains item discount groups for line discount and multiline discount. 
Another kind of discounts are total discounts (invoice discounts), which are 
specified independently from items at order header level. In the released product 
form, you can exclude particular products from the basis of total discount 
calculation by setting the slider Total discount on the tab Sell to “No”. 
In the customer form, the tab Sales order defaults contains the price groups and 
discount groups (line discount, multiline discount). 
4.3.2.3 Structure of Trade Agreements 
Trade agreements in sales determine prices and discounts depending on customers 
and items (released products). Dynamics AX includes the following types of trade 
agreements for this purpose: 
 Sales prices 
 Line discounts 
 Multiline discounts 
 Total discounts (Invoice discounts) 
Section 3.3.3 contains a description of price trade agreements on the example of 
purchase prices. In addition to the options available in purchasing, the sales trade 
agreements include the option to apply a Generic currency and an Exchange rate type 
specified in the accounts receivable parameters (Accounts receivable> Setup> 
Accounts receivable parameters, tab Prices). If a generic currency is specified, prices in 
trade agreements in this currency (if the slider Include in generic currency in the 
agreement line is set to “Yes”) are automatically converted to other currencies if 
there is no other applicable trade agreement when entering a sales order line. 
In the order management, you can assign discounts to the header and to the lines: 
 Line and multiline discounts – Assigned to order lines 
 Total discounts – Assigned to order headers 
Discount and price trade agreements can refer to different pricing levels. You can 
for example enter a price agreement for an individual customer, for a customer 
discount group, or for all customers. 
Line discount agreements can – in addition to the customer dimension – refer to 
the item dimension: Individual item, item discount group, or all items. Table 4-1 
shows the different levels of line discount agreements in the dimension item and 
customer. 

4.3  Product Management in Sales

All items 
Customer number

As a result, you can enter a line discount agreement for a particular item and a 
particular customer, and another agreement for an item discount group and all 
customers. 
For multiline discounts, the same principle applies except that you can’t enter a 
multiline discount for an item number. 
Trade agreements for prices and trade agreements for total discounts have only got 
one dimension. Prices are specified per item, which restricts the item dimension to 
“Item number”. Total discounts apply at order header level, which restricts the 
item dimension to “All items”. 
4.3.2.4 Managing Line Discount Agreements 
In order to view sales line discounts, you can access the line discounts from 
different menu items depending on the basis of the discount: 
 For an item (including the line discount group of the item) – In the released 
product form, click the button SELL/View/Line discount 
 For a customer (including the line discount group of the customer) – In the 
customer form, click the button SELL/Trade agreements/Discounts/Line discount 
 For an item discount group – In the item discount group form (Sales and 
marketing> Prices and discounts> Item discount groups), click the button TRADE 
AGREEMENTS/Sales/View line discount 
 For a customer discount group – In the customer price/discount group form 
(Sales and marketing> Prices and discounts> Customer price/discount groups), select 
the option “Line discount group” in the lookup Show and click the button 
TRADE AGREEMENTS/Sales/View line discount 
When working in line discount agreements, be aware that the column Discount 
shows a discount amount. The discount percentage 1 shows in a separate column 
and in the footer pane of the form. The discount percentage 2 only shows in the 
footer pane. 
Another important setting for discount calculation is the column Find next in the 
discounts form. The checkbox there should only be selected for discounts, which 
apply in addition to discounts entered at another level. In the example of trade 
agreements shown in Figure 4-7, the discount in a sales order line with a quantity 
of 100 units (or more) would be 17 percent, if the checkbox Find next was marked 
for the 12 percent discount line and if the item is assigned to the item discount 
group with a discount of 5 percent in the other agreement line. 

134 
4  Sales and Distribution 
 
Figure 4-7: 
Viewing line discounts for a customer discount group 
Like registering a new price agreement (see section 3.3.3), registering a new sales 
line discount agreement requires to enter and to post a trade agreement journal 
(Sales and marketing> Prices and discounts> Trade agreement journals). After creating a 
journal by clicking the button New in the agreement journal header, click the 
button Lines in the action pane to access the journal lines. 
When registering a sales line discount in an agreement journal line, make sure to 
select “Line discount (Sales)” in the column Relation. Line discount agreements 
(similar to price agreements) include following fields: 
 Period of validity – From date and To date, referring to order entry or delivery 
(controlled by the Date type on the tab Prices in accounts receivable parameters) 
 Quantity – Column From and To (for quantity-dependent discounts) 
 Unit of measure – Column Unit 
 Currency – Currency, for which the discount applies 
 Customer dimension – Column Account code and Account selection (Individual 
customer, customer group, or all customers) 
 Item dimension – Column Item code and Item relation – Individual item, item 
discount group, or all items 
When entering line discounts, you have to keep in mind that discount percentages 
show in the footer pane of the journal lines. 
If you want to enter line discounts at inventory dimension level (e.g. per site or 
color) and the appropriate dimension column does not show, click the button 
Inventory/Display dimensions in the action pane and select the appropriate 
dimension. As a prerequisite, the dimension group of the particular item has to 
include the selected dimension in the price search. 
Once you have finished entering the line discounts in the agreement journal, click 
the button Post to activate the agreement. 

4.3  Product Management in Sales 
135 
If you want to update or to delete an active trade agreement, access the trade 
agreement inquiry form and select the agreement before clicking the button Edit 
selected lines. Like when updating purchase prices (see section 3.3.3), the update or 
deletion is posted through a new journal which is linked to the selected agreement. 
4.3.2.5 Managing Multiline Discounts and Total Discounts 
Whereas the line discount calculation is based upon individual order lines, 
multiline discount calculation includes all lines of a sales order with items which 
contain the same multiline discount group. You can use multiline discounts, if you 
want to grant a discount based upon the total quantity of different items. Multiline 
discount administration works similar to line discount administration. 
Unlike line discounts, total discounts (invoice discounts) are not based upon items 
or item groups. Total discounts refer to a complete invoice and provide the option 
to enter a discount based upon the invoice total. 
4.3.2.6 Required Setup for Prices and Discounts 
As a prerequisite for creating trade agreements, set up at least one trade agreement 
journal name (Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Prices and discounts> Trade agreement 
journal names, also containing purchase trade agreement journal names). 
If you want to use trade agreements at group level, you have to create appropriate 
price and discount groups and assign them to customers and/or released products. 
Trade agreements are only used in price and discount calculation, if appropriate 
combinations in the price/discount activation (Sales and marketing> Setup> Prices and 
discounts> Activate price/discount) are selected. 
Within the activated elements, discount calculation searches from the specific 
definition to the general – first the customer and item number level, then the group 
level, and finally the general discount level. Depending on the setting in the 
checkbox Find next of the selected trade agreements, only one discount or the total 
of discounts at multiple levels applies to a particular order line. 
If line discount and multiline discount apply to a particular sales order line in 
parallel, a setting in the accounts receivable parameters (field Discount on the tab 
Prices) controls how to calculate the total of line and multiline discount. 
4.3.2.7 Ledger Integration 
Since discounts have an impact on finance, Dynamics AX includes discount 
posting in ledger transactions. Relating to ledger transactions and sales revenue 
calculation, you have to distinguish between line and multiline discounts on the 
one hand and total discounts on the other hand. 
Line and multiline discounts are included in item revenue calculation, therefore 
reducing revenue and gross margin. Settings for the ledger integration of line and 
multiline discounts provide the option to either reduce the amount posted to 

136 
4  Sales and Distribution 
revenue accounts, or to post the discount to separate accounts. Dynamics AX posts 
to separate accounts, if the inventory posting setup (see section 9.4.2) contains 
appropriate main accounts (Inventory management> Setup> Posting> Posting, tab 
Sales order, option Discount). 
Unlike line and multiline discounts, total discounts do not reduce the revenue at 
item level. In addition, it is not possible to post total discounts to different main 
accounts. The account number for total discount transactions is specified in the 
accounts for automatic transaction (General ledger> Posting setup> Accounts for 
automatic transactions), where a line for the posting type “Customer invoice 
discount” contains the appropriate main account. 
4.3.3 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 4.3 – Sales Categories 
Your company offers installation services to your customers. For this purpose, 
enter a new category “##-installation” (## = your user ID) in the sales category 
hierarchy. This sales category applies the item sales tax group which refers to the 
standard tax rate. 
Exercise 4.4 – Price List 
Your company requires an additional price list applicable to new sales markets. 
Enter a new customer price group P-## (## = your user ID) for this price list and 
attach it to your customer of exercise 4.1. 
The new price list should show a price of USD 90.00 for the item of exercise 3.5 
starting from the current date. Enter and post this price in a trade agreement 
journal. Then check if the price shows correctly on your customer. 
Exercise 4.5 – Line Discount 
You agree with your customer of exercise 4.1 to grant a line discount of 10 percent 
on all items. Enter and post a trade agreement for this discount, which only applies 
to your customer. Which setting is required to use the discount in sales order lines? 
4.4 
Sales Order Management 
The first document generated in relation to a sales order often is a sales quote, 
which you can send to a prospect or customer in reply to a request for quotation. 
Once the customer orders some goods or services, enter an appropriate sales order. 
Relating to the functionality and the structure of forms and list pages, sales orders 
work similar to purchase orders. This section therefore primarily explains subjects 
in sales, which are different from purchasing. 
4.4.1 
Basics of Sales Order Processing 
Unlike purchase orders, which are primarily based on material requirements 
known within Dynamics AX, sales orders in most cases originate from sources 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
137 
outside the application. Apart from manually entering a sales order, there are only 
a few other options to generate a sales order from within Dynamics AX. Possible 
prior steps to a sales order are: 
 Sales quotations – After receiving the acceptance from the customer 
 Sales agreements – Blanket orders are the basis for release sales orders 
 Data import/export framework – Exchanging data with other applications 
 Intercompany functionality – Purchase orders in another legal entity 
 Project module – Creating project sales orders or item requirements 
In Dynamics AX, blanket orders are covered by sales agreements (Sales and 
marketing> Sales agreements> Sales agreements), which do not only contain contracts 
at the level of product number and quantity, but also at the level of the total sales 
amount for a product, or at the level of the total sales volume for a customer. In 
order to ship and invoice deliveries related to a sales agreement, you have to create 
release orders (regular sales orders linked to the sales agreement). The 
functionality of sales agreement matches the purchase agreements functionality as 
described in section 3.8.1. 
Once you have finished creating a new sales order – either manually or 
transferring a prior document like the sales agreement – you can post and print the 
order confirmation. The further proceeding depends on the required transactions 
in inventory and sales, reflected by settings in Dynamics AX. 
 
Figure 4-8: 
Sales order processing in Dynamics AX 
In order to process a sales order in the warehouse, there are following options as 
shown in Figure 4-8: 
 Packing slip – Immediately posting the packing slip 
 Picking list – Posting a picking list before packing slip posting 

138 
4  Sales and Distribution 
 Picking list registration – Registration of the posted picking list before packing 
slip posting 
 Advanced warehouse management – Using advanced warehouse management 
functionality (see chapter 8) 
In addition, you can execute picking using the pick form in the sales order line. 
Usually you work this way if you have to register serial numbers or batch 
numbers, but do not process picking as a separate process in the warehouse. 
After posting the packing slip, you can post invoice. If no packing slip is required, 
you can post the invoice immediately after entering the order. 
4.4.2 
Sales Quotation 
In a sales quotation, the business partner does not need to be a customer – it can be 
also a prospect. But since sales orders require a customer record, you have to 
convert the prospect to a customer before you can transfer an accepted quotation to 
a sales order. 
4.4.2.1 Managing Prospects 
Prospects are parties – companies or persons – in sales, who are not customers yet. 
Unlike customers, who are used in accounts receivable transactions, prospects are 
not included in financial transactions. But they are used in CRM activities like 
mailings and marketing campaigns, and in sales quotations. 
If you want to create a new prospect, open the form Sales and marketing> 
Relationships> Prospect> All prospects and click the button New in the action pane.  
The Create new prospect dialog works similar to the create customer dialog (see 
section 4.2.1), integrating prospects with the global address book. 
In the prospect detail form, you can update basic data like the sales tax group 
(VAT group) and the customer group of the new prospect. Some default data like 
the prospect type (Type ID on the tab General) of a new prospect derive from the tab 
Prospects in the sales and marketing parameters. 
If you want to convert a prospect to a customer, click the button GENERAL/ 
Convert/Convert to customer in the action pane of the prospect form. Depending on 
the setting in the type (Sales and marketing> Setup> Prospects> Relation types) of the 
prospect, the prospect is deleted automatically after converting. 
4.4.2.2 Processing Sales Quotations 
In order to create a new sales quotation, open the quotation form (Sales and 
marketing> Sales quotations> All quotations) and click the button New in the action 
pane. Alternatively, you can create a quotation by clicking the button SELL/New/ 
Sales quotation in the customer form or in the prospect form. 
If creating a quotation in the quotation form, the Create quotation dialog displays 
where you have to select the Account type (“Customer” or “Prospect”). Depending 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
139 
on the selected account type, enter a customer or a prospect in the appropriate 
lookup field. Dynamics AX then applies default values from the selected customer 
or prospect to the sales quotation, which you can override in the Create dialog. 
Clicking the button OK in the dialog creates the quotation header and switches to 
the quotation detail form showing the lines view. 
 
Figure 4-9: 
Creating a new quotation for a prospect 
In the quotation detail form, you can start to enter a line on the tab Lines by clicking 
the button Add line in the toolbar or by simply clicking the first line in the grid. 
Then select an item number or a sales category and other line details as required. 
Clicking the button QUOTATION/Generate/Send quotation in the action pane of the 
quotation form posts and prints the quotation (similar to an order confirmation in 
a sales order). Depending on the answer of the customer or prospect, click the 
button FOLLOW UP/Generate/Confirm in the action pane at a later time to confirm 
the quotation (automatically generating a sales order). 
If the quote refers to a prospect, you have to transfer the prospect to a customer 
before creating the sales order. For this purpose, the button FOLLOW UP/Modify/ 
Convert to customer is available directly in the quotation form. 
4.4.3 
Sales Order Registration 
Like in a purchase order, the order type in a sales order is a core characteristic. The 
order type in a sales orders can show following order types: 
 Sales order – Regular sales order 
 Journal – Draft or template, without impact on inventory and finance 
 Subscription – Periodic order, remains open after invoicing 
 Returned order – Credit note, see section 4.7.1 

140 
4  Sales and Distribution 
The order type “Item requirements” shown as additional option characterizes 
particular sales orders generated in the Dynamics AX project module, which is 
beyond the scope of this book. It is not possible to enter orders of the type “Item 
requirements” manually in sales. 
4.4.3.1 Entering a New Sales Order 
Depending on how you want to proceed, there are different starting points where 
you can create a sales order: 
 Customer form – Sales and marketing> Customers> All customers, button SELL/ 
New/Sales order 
 Sales order processing and inquiry workspace – Button New/Sales order 
 Sales order form – Sales and marketing> Sales orders> All sales orders, button New 
The Sales order processing and inquiry workspace, which you can access from the 
dashboard, shows an overview of unconfirmed and delayed orders on tabbed lists 
in the center. Clicking the tile All sales orders on the left pane provides access to the 
sales order list page showing all orders. You can create a new order in the 
workspace by clicking the button New/Sales order in the action pane. The following 
steps are the same as when creating an order from the sales order form. 
 
Figure 4-10: Entering a sales order line with a sales category in the order form 
In the Create sales order dialog, choose a customer in the Customer account field. You 
can search the customer by starting to type the first characters of the customer 
number (or the name), or by opening the lookup and applying a Grid column filter – 
e.g. in the column Name of the lookup. The sales order then accepts various default 
values from the selected customer, which you can override in the dialog. Clicking 
the button OK in the dialog finally creates the sales order header and switches to 
the order detail form in the lines view. 
In the sales order detail form, you can start entering a line on the tab Sales order 
lines by clicking the button Add line in the toolbar or by simply clicking the first line 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
141 
in the grid. Then select an item number or a sales category and enter other line 
details as required. 
Working in sales orders corresponds to working in purchase orders for the most 
part. For this reason, you can refer to section 3.4.2 regarding following topics: 
 Structure and features in the order form 
 Sales tax / VAT (see also section 9.2.6) 
 Delivery schedule 
 Orders of the type “Journal” (Section 3.4.2) 
 Canceling orders (Section 3.4.4) 
 Partial delivery, over and under delivery (Section 3.5.5) 
 Order status and inquiries (Section 3.5.6 and 3.6.3) 
Unlike purchase orders, sales orders do not apply change management and order 
approval. 
When deleting a sales order, following accounts receivable parameters apply: 
 Mark order as voided (tab General) – If set to “Yes”, deleted sales orders show 
in the form Sales and marketing> Inquiries and reports> History> Voided sales orders. 
 Delete order line invoiced in total and Delete order after invoicing (tab 
Updates) – If set to “Yes”, orders (or order lines) are deleted when posting the 
invoice. 
4.4.3.2 Keyword Search 
The keyword search is an enhanced search functionality, available for searching 
customers, prospects, and items. 
Before using the keyword search, you have to set up basic search parameters in the 
form Sales and marketing> Setup> Search> Search parameters. Then select the fields to 
be included in the search functionality on the tab Criteria in this form, or in the 
form Sales and marketing> Setup> Search> Define criteria. Buttons in the toolbar or the 
action pane specify the search fields for the customer search and the item search. 
When creating a new sales order, you can select the option “Keyword” in the 
lookup Search by of the create order dialog to execute a customer search according 
to the selected criteria. 
The item keyword search shows up if you enter part of the product name in the 
item number field of a sales order line and press the Tab key (ignoring the lookup 
which opens automatically). As a prerequisite for searching by product name, the 
search criteria setup has to include the product name. 
4.4.3.3 Sales Order Hold 
Sales order holds provide the option to put an order on hold while giving a reason 
for the hold. As a prerequisite, you have to set up hold codes (Sales and Marketing> 
Setup> Sales orders> Order hold codes) indicating the different hold reasons. 

142 
4  Sales and Distribution 
If you want to set an order hold, click the button SALES ORDER/Functions/Order 
holds in the sales order form. In the order hold form, click the button New and 
select the appropriate Hold code. The sales order list page then shows a checkmark 
in the column Do not process for the order and prevents order processing. 
In order to clear the hold, open the order hold form by clicking the appropriate 
button in the sales order again (or accessing the menu item Sales and marketing> 
Sales orders> Open orders> Order holds) and click the button CLEAR HOLD/Clear 
holds in the action pane. 
If you do not want to assign the decision to somebody else, click the button HOLD 
CHECKOUT/Override checkout in the order hold form and select the other user in 
the dialog. The selected user then is the only person who may work on the hold. If 
you need to override the checkout and transfer it to another user, click the Override 
checkout button again. The checkout is cleared by finally clearing the order hold, or 
by clicking the button HOLD CHECKOUT/Clear checkout. 
4.4.3.4 Delivery Address and Invoice Address 
The delivery address in a sales order derives from the primary address (or from 
the delivery address) of the customer. Like in a purchase order (see section 3.4.2), 
you can override the address on the tab Address in the header view or – at line level 
– on the sub-tab Address of the order lines. In this context, settings on the tab 
Summary update in the accounts receivable parameters determine whether posted 
documents (e.g. invoices) are split based upon different addresses. 
Unlike the delivery address, address data for the invoice address are not directly 
editable in a sales order. The invoice address is the address of the Invoice account on 
the tab General in the sales order header view. The default for this invoice account 
is the invoice account in the customer record, but you can override the invoice 
account number in an order. If the invoice account field in the customer record is 
empty, Dynamics AX inserts the order customer number into the invoice account 
of the order. In case the customer record of the invoice account contains an address 
with the purpose “Invoice”, this address prints on documents instead of the 
primary address of the invoice customer. 
4.4.3.5 Item List 
If a customer frequently orders the same products, you can use item lists in 
Dynamics AX as a copy template with item numbers and quantity. 
For this purpose, you can set up multiple item lists in the form Sales and marketing> 
Setup> Items> Item list. If you want to create a new list, click the button New and 
enter the Item list ID and the Description. Then click the button Add in the toolbar of 
the tab Items and add items (including product dimensions as applicable) with 
their particular default order quantity. The button Item list generation in the action 
pane of this form provides the option to generate a customer-specific item list 
based on past sales. 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
143 
In order to use item lists in a sales order, click the button Sales order line/Copy/From 
item list in the toolbar of the order lines. In the Item list dialog, select applicable 
items and optionally override the quantity before clicking Copy and close. 
4.4.3.6 Delivery Date Control 
An important task in sales order management is to determine delivery dates. A 
number of aspects determine the calculation of delivery dates in sales: 
 Item availability 
 Order entry deadlines 
 Sales lead time 
 Delivery date control settings 
When discussing delivery dates, you have to keep in mind that Dynamics AX 
distinguishes between the shipping date and the customer receipt date on the one 
hand, and between the requested and the confirmed date on the other hand. For 
this reason, there are four different fields referring to the delivery date on the sub-
tab Delivery of the tab Line details in the sales order lines. 
If you want to calculate the delivery date automatically when entering a sales 
order line, activate the delivery date control on the tab Shipments of the accounts 
receivable parameters. The lookup Delivery date control there provides following 
options for delivery date calculation: 
 None – Not applying delivery date control 
 Sales lead time – Delivery date based on lead time and calendar settings 
 ATP (“Available to promise”) – Delivery date based on the item availability 
 ATP + Issue margin – Adding the safety margin for the item (specified in the 
coverage group) to the delivery date calculated from ATP 
 CTP (“Capable to promise”) – Immediately executing local master planning 
If the option “Sales lead time” is selected, delivery date calculation in sales order 
lines is only based on the applicable sales lead time and calendars. The sales lead 
time is the number of days required internally until shipping the item. A general 
default for the sales lead time is specified on the tab Shipments of the accounts 
receivable parameters. The lead time specified there applies as a default to the ship 
date in the order header. Order lines accept the header ship date, if the calculated 
delivery date based on the sales lead time of the item is not after the header ship 
date. You can specify sales lead times at item level in the default order settings, in 
the site-specific order settings, and in trade agreements for sales prices. 
If the option “ATP” is selected, delivery date calculation is based on the item 
availability within the ATP time fence (field group ATP). Existing planned orders 
are included in the ATP calculation, if the slider ATP incl. planned orders is set to 
“Yes”. If the quantity entered in a sales order line is not available (the calculation 
includes the on-hand quantity and the transactions within the ATP time fence), the 
shipping date is the first day after the ATP time fence. In order to avoid 

144 
4  Sales and Distribution 
unnecessary delays, the ATP time fence should consequently match the lead time. 
The ATP offset time settings in the accounts receivable parameters apply to the 
calculation of delayed demand and to supply transactions, which are scheduled for 
past periods. 
If the option “CTP” is selected, delivery date calculation immediately executes 
local master planning in the current dynamic master plan (see section 6.3.1) and 
creates planned purchase and production orders as required. For planned 
production orders, the delivery date resulting from the planned order includes the 
delivery time for components. 
 
Figure 4-11: Delivery control settings in the accounts receivable parameters 
Settings in the lookup Delivery date control of the released product (default order 
settings or site-specific order settings) can override the base settings in the accounts 
receivable parameters. If you want to activate or deactivate delivery control for a 
specific sales order or sales order line, you can override the lookup Delivery date 
control on the (sub-)tab Delivery of the order header or line. 
When determining the delivery date in an order line, the calculation includes 
following calendar and transport time settings: 
 Inventory management> Setup> Inventory breakdown> Warehouses, tab Master 
planning – Calendar of the shipping and the receipt warehouses 
 Organization administration> Organizations> Legal entities, tab Foreign trade and 
logistics – General Shipping calendar of the current company 
 Sales and marketing> Customers> All customers – Receipt calendar in the customer 
detail form (tab Invoice and delivery) or in the delivery address 
 Sales and marketing> Setup> Distribution> Modes of delivery, button Transport 
calendar – Transport calendar per delivery mode and – optionally – warehouse 
 Inventory management> Setup> Distribution> Transport days – Depending on 
delivery mode, shipping warehouse, and receipt address or warehouse 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
145 
Order entry deadlines (Inventory management> Setup> Distribution> Order entry 
deadlines) determine the final time for entering same-day shipments in sales order 
lines. After the deadline, delivery date calculation starts with the next day. 
In case delivery date control is activated, Dynamics AX checks if the item in the 
order line is available at the entered delivery date. In order to receive a proposal of 
possible delivery dates, click the link Simulate delivery date above the field Confirmed 
ship date on the (sub-)tab Delivery in the order header or line.  
If necessary, you can deactivate delivery date control by selecting the option 
“None” in the lookup Delivery date control on the order header or line. After 
deactivating delivery date control, you can enter a date which is not included in 
the regular dates of possible delivery. 
4.4.3.7 Item Availability and Delivery Alternatives 
As a prerequisite for shipping a product, it must be available in inventory. You can 
use manual or automatic reservation (see section 7.4.5) to make sure, that the 
required quantity is reserved for the order and not available for any other purpose. 
Multiple inquiries in the sales order form provide the option to check the 
availability of an item. If you only want to view the current inventory quantity of 
an item using the inventory dimensions of the order line (like site/warehouse), 
click the button Inventory/On-hand inventory in the toolbar of the order line. 
In order to view the distribution of the item quantity among warehouses and other 
inventory dimensions, click the button Overview in the On-hand-form. Clicking the 
button Display dimensions provides the option to select inventory dimensions. If 
clicking the button Net requirements, the net requirements form for displays. 
The button Product and supply/Net requirements in the toolbar of the sales order line 
provides the option to access the net requirements form, where you can start local 
master planning (see section 6.3) in order to calculate possible options for the 
delivery date. The button Product and supply/Explosion in the toolbar of the order 
line opens the explosion form, which shows the item availability at multiple BOM 
levels. 
In case there are issues to meet the required delivery date in an order line, the 
delivery alternatives dialog supports selecting other delivery options – 
warehouses, product dimensions (for product masters), and modes of delivery. 
You can access the delivery alternatives dialog by clicking the button Product and 
supply/Delivery alternatives in the toolbar of the sales order line. Clicking the button 
Select to promise and OK in the delivery alternatives transfers the selected 
alternative to the order line. The options in the dialog are depending on the setting 
in the lookup Delivery date control (sales lead time, ATP, CTP) on the sub-tab 
Delivery of the order line. 

146 
4  Sales and Distribution 
 
Figure 4-12: Selecting site and warehouse in the delivery alternatives dialog 
4.4.3.8 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Apart from the delivery alternatives dialog, new items in sales order management 
refer to the browser-based user interface with workspaces. 
4.4.4 
Order Price and Discount 
Based upon price and discount groups in the customer and order header, products 
and order lines, and appropriate trade agreements, Dynamics AX determines 
prices and discounts. Apart from the prices and discounts which apply 
immediately, trade allowances specifying a discount depending on the sales 
volume in a period (see section 4.9.1) have an impact on the sales revenue and 
profitability. 
4.4.4.1 Sales Price 
The sales price in an order line derives from the base price in the item record, or 
from applicable trade agreements. Trade agreements for prices at customer level 
take priority over prices at price group level. 
The price group (representing a price list in Dynamics AX) of a customer is 
specified in the field Price on the tab Sales order defaults of the customer form. When 
entering a sales order, the price group of the customer is the default for the price 
group on the tab Price and discount of the sales order header view. If required, you 
can change the price group in the sales order. 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
147 
In the sales order lines, you can override the calculated sales price and enter a new 
price manually. 
If you enter a sales price or discount manually, and afterwards modify data in 
fields of the order line which are among the basis of price calculation (e.g. the 
ordered quantity), Dynamics AX may override your manual price and discount 
with the applicable trade agreement. Depending on the accounts receivable 
parameters (tab Prices, include the source “Manual entry” in the list on the sub-tab 
Trade agreement evaluation), Dynamics AX shows a dialog before overriding the 
manual price or discount. 
If the margin percentage (calculated from the sales amount and the cost price) is 
too low, a margin alert icon shows in the column Margin alert of the order lines 
next to the Estimated margin %. As a prerequisite, margin alerts (with a minimum 
percentage for the acceptable and the questionable margin) have to be enabled on 
tab Margin alerts in the accounts receivable parameters. 
4.4.4.2 Discounts 
Sales orders apply the discounts from applicable trade agreements for total 
discounts, multiline discounts, or line discounts as default value. If you want to 
change a discount group in the order header, select the appropriate group on the 
tab Price and discount of the sales order header. 
Since the total discount is a discount at header level, the order header does not 
only contain the discount group for the total discount, but also the discount 
percentage. 
 
Figure 4-13: Price and discount groups in the sales order header 

148 
4  Sales and Distribution 
The percentage of a line discount shows in a separate column in the sales order 
lines. In addition, the line discount percentage together with the multiline discount 
also shows on the sub-tab Price and discount in the order line. Apart from the 
percentage fields, there are fields for the line discount amount and the multiline 
discount amount – be aware not to confuse percentage and amount fields. 
Dynamics AX calculates the line discount for a sales order line whenever saving 
the line. Unlike the line discount calculation, the multiline discount and the total 
discount calculation need to be started manually by clicking the button SELL/ 
Calculate/Multiline discount or SELL/Calculate/Total discount in the action pane. 
For the total discount, you can skip the manual calculation if the slider Calculate 
total discount on posting on the tab Prices of the accounts receivable parameters is set 
to “Yes”. In this case, Dynamics AX calculates the total discount whenever printing 
or posting an order. 
If price details are enabled in the accounts receivable parameters (tab Prices, slider 
Enable price details), you can view extended price and discount information in the 
price details form opened by clicking the button Sales order line/Price details in the 
toolbar of the sales order line. 
4.4.5 
Surcharge Management 
Charges in sales and purchase orders provide the option to cover expenses, which 
are not included in the price shown in order lines – for example fees for freight and 
insurance. 
You can enter charges manually at header level and at line level in a sales order or 
a purchase order. In addition, there are charges which apply automatically when 
entering an order header or line. 
Standard documents like the order confirmation only print the charges total 
amount, no matter if the applicable charges refer to the header or to specific lines. 
4.4.5.1 Charges Codes 
As a prerequisite for using charges in Dynamics AX, you have to set up the 
required charges codes. Charges codes for sales and for purchasing are 
independent from each other. For sales you have to access the form Accounts 
receivable> Charges setup> Charges code, and for purchasing the form Accounts 
payable> Charges setup> Charges code. 
When creating a new charges code, enter the charges code ID, the description, and 
the item sales tax group (if applicable) before switching to the tab Posting, where 
you have to record appropriate ledger integration settings. 
For sales charges, choose the Debit/Type “Customer/Vendor” and the Credit/Type 
“Ledger account” (with an appropriate revenue account in the Account field) if you 
want to calculate the charges on top of the item sales amount. The related charges 
amount prints separately on documents (e.g. invoices). 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
149 
 
Figure 4-14: Managing charges codes for sales 
For purchase charges to be shown separately on the vendor invoice, choose the 
option “Customer/Vendor” in the Credit/Type. In the Debit/Type, select “Ledger 
account” (posting to a separate ledger account) or “Item” (including the charges 
amount in the inventory value of the item). 
In addition to charges with Debit/Type (or Credit/Type) “Customer/Vendor”, which 
show separately on documents, it is also possible to set up charges codes 
generating only internal transactions in finance. The codes for these charges only 
include the types “Ledger account” or “Item” in the Debit and the Credit 
transaction. 
4.4.5.2 Manual Charges 
If you want to apply charges to a sales order or to a purchase order, open the 
charges transactions form. 
At header level, you can access the charges transaction form of a sales order by 
clicking the button SELL/Charges/Charges in the action pane of the sales order form. 
In purchase orders, click the button PURCHASE/Charges/Maintain charges in the 
action pane. In order to assign line charges in a sales order or purchase order detail 
form, click the button Financials/Maintain charges in the toolbar of the order lines. 
In the charges transactions form, first select the appropriate charges code. In the 
column Category you can specify if the charge is a fixed amount, or the calculation 
is based on the line amount or the line quantity. 
4.4.5.3 Auto Charges 
If you want to apply charges to sales orders automatically, enter automatic charges 
in the form Accounts receivable> Charges setup> Auto charges. Auto charges apply as 
default to charges transactions in sales orders, where you can override them. 

150 
4  Sales and Distribution 
 
Figure 4-15: Managing auto charges 
The header of the auto-charges form contains the lookup Level where you can 
choose whether to apply the charges to order headers or to lines. 
The top right pane of the form contains the customers and items to which the 
charge applies. Line charges can depend on the customer (customer number, 
group, or all customers), the mode of delivery (mode of delivery, group, or all) and 
on the item (item number, group, or all). For header charges, the item selection is 
fixed to “All”. 
In order to enter the calculation formula for the charge, access the tab Lines and – 
like in a manual charge – select the Category specifying if the charge is a fixed 
amount, or if it is calculated based on the line amount or the line quantity. 
As a prerequisite for applying auto charges to sales orders, the sliders Find auto 
charges for header or Find auto charges for line on the tab Prices of the accounts 
receivable parameters have to be selected. 
For purchasing, similar settings are available in the form Procurement and sourcing> 
Setup> Charges> Automatic charges and in the procurement parameters. 
4.4.6 
Sales Order Confirmation 
Printing an order confirmation requires to post it, which saves the document 
unchanging and separately from the actual sales order. Within Dynamics AX, it is 
the evidence of the document which has been sent to the customer. 
Like confirming a purchase order, posting a sales order confirmation does not 
create inventory or financial transactions. 
4.4.6.1 Posting Dialog for Sales Order Confirmations 
In order to generate an order confirmation, click the button SELL/Generate/ 
Confirmation (or SELL/Generate/Confirm sales order) in the action pane of the sales 
order form. The posting dialog for the sales order confirmation is similar to the 

4.4  Sales Order Management 
151 
posting dialogs in purchasing (see in section 3.4.5). Like there, you can select the 
printer by clicking the button Printer setup or by setting the slider Use print 
management destination to “Yes”. Make sure that the sliders Posting and Print 
confirmation in the posting dialog are set to “Yes” before clicking the button OK to 
post and print the confirmation finally. 
As an alternative to the sales order form, you can access the posting dialog for 
order confirmations by clicking the button Confirm on the tab Unconfirmed in the 
tabbed list pane of the Sales order processing and inquiry workspace. Another option 
for posting order confirmations is the appropriate menu item for summary update 
(Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Order confirmation> Confirm sales order). In the 
posting dialog for summary update, apply a filter by clicking the button Select. 
4.4.6.2 Inquiries 
Once a sales order confirmation has been posted, the posted document provides 
the option to display and to reprint the order confirmation independently from 
later modifications in the actual order. In order to access the posted order 
confirmations, open the form Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Order confirmation> 
Sales order confirmations or click the button SELL/Journals/Sales order confirmation in 
the action pane of the sales order. 
4.4.7 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 4.6 – Sales Order 
Your customer (entered in exercise 4.1) orders 20 units of the item created in 
exercise 3.5. You want to register the sales order starting in the customer form. 
Which quantity and which price show as default, where do they come from? 
Then switch to the header view and check the delivery address and the price group 
of the current order. 
Exercise 4.7 – Charges 
Your company wants to invoice a handling fee to customers. Enter a charges code 
C-## (## = your user ID) with the standard tax rate, selecting the posting type 
“Customer revenue” and an appropriate revenue account for credit posting. 
In the sales order header of exercise 4.6, add this new handling fee as additional 
charge to the customer with an amount of 10 USD. 
Exercise 4.8 – Order Confirmation 
Post and print the order confirmation for your order of exercise 4.6 from the Sales 
order processing and inquiry workspace and select to display a print preview. Can 
you tell which amount shows in the order line and where the confirmation prints 
the charges?

4.5 
Delivery Management 
Delivery management includes all activities in the process of picking and shipping 
the ordered items. Picking, as preparation for shipping, is the internal process of 
collecting items within the warehouse. 
4.5.1 
Basics of Picking and Shipping 
In order to prepare picking and shipping, you have to check upcoming deliveries 
continuously. For this purpose, the Sales order processing and inquiry workspace 
shows delayed orders and orders with delivery date changes on tabbed lists in the 
center. Apart from the workspace, there are particular forms which are designed to 
review pending shipments: 
 Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Open orders> Backorder lines 
 Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Open orders> Open sales order lines 
In addition, pending shipments also show by filtering on the delivery date or the 
ship date in the posting dialog of picking lists and packing slips. 
4.5.1.1 Picking Policy 
In Dynamics AX, it is not required to process picking as a separate step. Depending 
on the setup, you can skip picking and immediately ship an item by posting the 
packing slip or the invoice. 
If you want to process picking, the warehouse policy (distinguishing between the 
basic approach and the advanced warehouse management) determines the 
available options. Depending on the warehouse policy, there are following options 
for the picking process: 
 One-step picking 
o Pick form – Manual recording in the pick form 
o Picking list – With automatic picking list registration 
 Two-step picking 
o Order picking – Picking list, followed by picking list registration 
o Advanced warehouse management – Picking wave, followed by mobile 
device transactions 
One-step picking is a process where you perform picking, but do not require 
confirming the picked quantity. This way of picking is only used in the basic 
approach for warehouse management. 
Two-step picking requires confirming the actually picked quantity. In a warehouse 
applying the basic approach, this is done by entering the picking list registration 
(based on the picking list posted before). In a warehouse applying advanced 
warehouse management, the confirmation is done through mobile device 
transactions (based on picking wave work generated before). 

4.5  Delivery Management 
153 
 
Figure 4-16: Options for sales order picking in Dynamics AX 
This section covers the picking process in the basic approach for warehouse 
management. In section 8.1.2 you can find a description on how to process picking 
using advanced warehouse management. 
4.5.1.2 Core Settings for Picking 
A number of settings control the picking process. Apart from settings relevant for 
advanced warehouse management, the accounts receivable parameters determine 
whether to apply one-step or two-step picking in the basic approach for warehouse 
management: 
 One-step picking – If the Picking route status on the tab Updates of the accounts 
receivable parameters shows the option “Completed”, automatic picking list 
registration is enabled. Dynamics AX then immediately reduces the quantity in 
inventory when posting the picking list. 
 Two-step picking – If the Picking route status is set to “Activated”, 
Dynamics AX does not change the quantity in inventory when posting the 
picking list. In this case you have to update the Picking list registration 
subsequently. 
Picking is only possible for stocked items (as specified in the item model group). 
The item model group of the item further controls whether you have to register 
picking before posting the packing slip (checkbox Picking requirements on the tab 
Inventory policies of the item model group). 
4.5.1.3 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Since the old “Warehouse Management II” module is not supported in the new 
release, items referring to consolidated picking have been removed. 
4.5.2 
Pick Form and Picking List 
Picking in sales corresponds to inventory registration in purchasing: After picking, 
the related quantity shows the status “Picked” and is not included in the on-hand 

154 
4  Sales and Distribution 
quantity any more. Like inventory registration in purchasing, picking is a 
preliminary transaction which does not show separately in inventory transactions. 
4.5.2.1 Pick Form 
The first option for picking, the pick form (manual picking of sales orders) works 
similar to the registration form (see section 3.5.3). You can access the pick form by 
clicking the button Update line/Pick in the toolbar of the order lines in the sales 
order form. 
In the pick form, you can record item picking by inserting appropriate lines in the 
lower Picking lines pane. Apart from manually entering records by clicking the 
button Add in the lower pane, the button Add picking line in the toolbar of the upper 
pane is another option to insert lines. After editing the quantity, the warehouse, or 
other inventory dimensions in the lower pane as applicable, post the transaction by 
clicking the button Confirm pick all in the toolbar of the lower pane. 
4.5.2.2 Picking List 
If you need a printed report to support picking in the warehouse, you can post and 
print a picking list instead of registering the picking transaction in the pick form. In 
Dynamics AX, there are multiple ways to post the picking list: 
 Sales order – Sales order form, button PICK AND PACK/Generate/Generate picking 
list in the action pane 
 Summary update – Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Order shipping> Generate 
picking list 
 Release picking – Starting from the Release sales order picking form, see below 
 Picking workbench – Grouping picking lists to batches, see section 4.5.3 
After posting and printing the picking list, you can provide the warehouse 
personnel with a hardcopy of the picking list. 
If the warehouse usually picks all items immediately, it is useful to enable one-step 
picking by setting the parameter Picking route status in the accounts receivable 
parameters to “Completed”. In this case, no manual picking list registration is 
required and the next step in Dynamics AX is to post the packing slip. 
4.5.2.3 Picking List Registration 
Picking list registration is required after posting a picking list, if two-step picking 
applies (accounts receivable parameter Picking route status set to “Activated”). 
In this case, you can access the picking list registration form by clicking the button 
PICK AND PACK/Generate/Picking list registration in the action pane of the sales 
order form. Alternatively, you can access the picking list registration form through 
the menu item Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Order shipping> Picking list 
registration or the menu item Inventory management> Outbound orders> Picking list 
registration. If starting from the sales order, picking list registration applies a filter 

4.5  Delivery Management 
155 
on the current order. Otherwise, you have to enter a filter manually to show 
appropriate orders. 
 
Figure 4-17: Picking list registration accessed from a sales order (tab General collapsed) 
In the Lines tab of the picking list registration form, you can choose the lines which 
should be updated by selecting the checkbox in the column Select (see Figure 4-17). 
Before confirming the picked quantity of these lines by clicking the button 
Updates/Update selected (or Updates/Update all for all lines), adjust the quantity in the 
Pick quantity column as applicable. 
4.5.2.4 Release Sales Order Picking 
If you want to start picking from an overview with order lines ready for shipping, 
open the release picking form (Inventory management> Periodic tasks> Release sales 
order picking). The release picking form only includes items which are currently on 
stock and provides the option to select multiple sales order lines for shipping. 
When opening the release picking form, an advanced filter displays for entering 
filter criteria on order lines. By clicking the button Select in the action pane of the 
release picking form, you can modify this filter as applicable later. 
If you click the appropriate option in the button Activation on the action pane or 
enter quantities in the column Activate now manually, the items are activated for 
picking. This activation includes reserving the item quantity. 
For the quantities in the column Activate now, you can post the picking list by 
clicking the button Release for pick in the action pane. The further proceeding, 
including one-step or two-step picking, is the same as when posting the picking list 
directly from the order. 
If you want to specify priorities for picking based on the customer, you can enter a 
Classification group on the tab General of the customer form. This group displays in 

156 
4  Sales and Distribution 
the left-most column of the release picking form, which provides the option to 
filter on this criterion. 
 
Figure 4-18: Release sales order picking 
4.5.2.5 Reverse Picking Transactions 
The pick form is not only used for picking, but also for reversing a pick transaction, 
which has been posted in the pick form or through a picking list. Similar to 
registering the original picking transaction, you can access the pick form in the 
sales order detail form by clicking the button Update line/Pick in the toolbar of the 
order lines after selecting the respective line. In the upper pane of the pick form, 
click the button Add picking line after selecting the appropriate transaction. Posting 
the reversing transaction by clicking the button Confirm pick all works similar to 
regular picking, but with a negative quantity. 
If the original picking transaction has been posted through a picking list, you can 
alternatively use the picking list registration to reverse picking. In this case, open 
the picking list registration form by clicking the button PICK AND PACK/Generate/ 
Picking list registration in the action pane of the sales order form. In the picking list 
registration form, click the button Functions/Unpick in the toolbar of the tab Lines. 
In a second step, you have to click the button Functions/Cancel picking line in the 
action pane of the picking list registration form to cancel the picking list itself. You 
can skip the second step by setting the slider Cancel unpicked quantity in the 
unpicking dialog of the first step to “Yes”.

4.5.3 
Picking Workbench 
The picking workbench is an enhancement for sales order picking in paper-based 
warehouse processes, which provides the option to group picking lists to batches 
(picking waves). 
Optionally you can apply a boxing logic to collect items in boxes or carts if your 
picking process includes putting items into boxes. Dynamics AX then suggests 
boxes of an appropriate size for picking. 
You can use the picking workbench as an alternative to the Release sales order 
picking functionality described in section 4.5.2. 
4.5.3.1 Setup for the Picking Workbench 
As a primary prerequisite, number sequences for the picking workbench have to be 
specified in the inventory parameters (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory and 
warehouse management parameters). If you want to use the boxing logic, set the slider 
Boxing logic for picking workbench on the tab General of the parameters to “Yes”. 
In the workbench profile (Inventory management> Setup> Picking workbench> 
Workbench profiles), set up one or more profiles used as filtering criteria in the 
picking workbench. 
In the warehouse form (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory breakdown> 
Warehouses), the tab Picking workbench contains settings for splitting picking waves 
(workbench sessions) – e.g. the maximum number of lines per picking list. 
If you want to use the boxing logic in the picking workbench, open the form 
Inventory management> Setup> Boxing logic> Box definitions and set up the different 
boxes which are used in the warehouse with their physical dimensions and weight. 
The checkbox Active controls whether a box is available for picking. 
In the released products detail form, the tab Deliver contains the slider Apply boxing 
logic for picking workbench which has to be set to “Yes” for items using the boxing 
logic. The selection of applicable boxes for an item is only based on the physical 
dimensions and the weight of the item (tab Manage inventory of the released 
product). If the slider Ship alone on the tab Deliver of the released product is set to 
“Yes”, the item will be picked separately without boxing. 
4.5.3.2 Working with the Picking Workbench 
Picking processes in the picking workbench are based on sales orders which you 
have to enter before you can start picking. 
In the picking workbench (Inventory management> Outbound orders> Picking 
workbench), you can start the picking process by clicking the button New in the 
action pane. On the tab Criteria of the picking workbench form, enter criteria like 
the Ship date of the order line to specify which sales orders should be included in 

158 
4  Sales and Distribution 
the current picking. In the criteria field Profile, you can select a workbench profile 
providing default values for the criteria fields. 
After selecting appropriate criteria, click the button PICKING SESSION/Generate 
picking batches in the action pane of the picking workbench. Depending on the 
criteria, on settings for splitting picking batches in the warehouse form, and on 
settings for boxing (box size and item size/weight), Dynamics AX then creates one 
or more picking batches. Generating picking batches executes picking list posting. 
The picking lists linked to a picking batch show on the tab Picking list in the 
workbench. 
 
Figure 4-19: Managing a picking batch in the picking workbench 
Printing the picking batch label and the picking list is a required step, which you 
can do by clicking the button Print batch in the toolbar of the Picking batches pane in 
the workbench. For items applying the boxing logics, the selected box name is 
printed in the picking list header. 
After printing all picking lists of a picking batch, select the checkbox Complete in 
the picking batch. The slider Complete in the picking session completes all related 
picking batches. 
Depending on whether one-step picking or two-step picking applies to your 
company (see section 4.5.1), the next step is posting the packing slip (one-step 
picking) or confirming the picking list (two-step picking). 

4.5  Delivery Management 
159 
In case of two-step picking, confirming the picking list through the picking list 
registration is not different from the regular picking list registration in the basic 
picking list process. But in addition to the other access options to the picking list 
registration, the picking workbench contains the button Picking list registration to 
access the picking list registration form directly. 
4.5.4 
Packing Slip 
Posting the packing slip (delivery note) is the last step in the picking and shipping 
process. 
4.5.4.1 Posting Dialog for Packing Slips 
You can open the posting dialog for packing slips by clicking the button PICK AND 
PACK/Generate/Packing slip in the action pane of the sales order form or through the 
menu item Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Order shipping> Post packing slip. 
The posting dialog shows the familiar format. The applicable option in the lookup 
field Quantity on the tab Parameters is depending on the prior process: 
 Picked – Select this option, if picking is executed before posting the packing 
slip. The picked quantity then is the default for the column Update on the tab 
Lines of the posting dialog. 
 Picked quantity and non-stocked products – Includes the ordered quantity of 
non-stocked products in addition to picked quantity of stocked items. 
 All – The total remaining order quantity applies. 
 Deliver now – The quantity of the column Deliver now in the order lines applies. 
Make sure that the sliders Posting and Print packing slip in the posting dialog are set 
to “Yes” before clicking the button OK in order to post and print the packing slip. 
Partial deliveries, over deliveries, and under deliveries are available in sales the 
same way as in purchasing (see section 3.5.5). If you want to learn about the order 
status and the document status update, you can also refer to the corresponding 
purchase order status as described in section 3.5.6. 
4.5.4.2 Ledger Integration 
If ledger integration is activated for packing slip posting, Dynamics AX posts 
transactions to the general ledger in parallel to the inventory transactions. These 
ledger transactions are reversed when posting the related invoice. 
Following core settings control packing slip posting to the general ledger: 
 Accounts receivable parameters – The slider Post packing slip in ledger on the tab 
Updates has to be set to “Yes” to enable ledger posting (not required for 
standard cost items). 
 Item model group – The checkbox Post physical inventory on the tab Costing 
method & cost recognition in the item model group of the item has to be selected. 

160 
4  Sales and Distribution 
These settings work similar to the related setting for the ledger integration of 
product receipts. 
4.5.4.3 Transaction Inquiry 
If you want to view the inventory transactions in the sales order form after posting 
the packing slip, click the button Inventory/Transactions in the toolbar of the order 
lines. After posting the packing slip, the issue status of the inventory transaction is 
“Deducted”. The posting date of the packing slip shows in the column Physical date 
whereas the Financial date remains empty until posting the invoice. The packing 
slip number shows on the tab Updates of the Transaction detail form (access by 
clicking the button Transaction details in the inventory transaction). 
 
Figure 4-20: Inventory transaction after packing slip posting 
In order to access the posted packing slips, open the form Sales and marketing> Sales 
orders> Order shipping> Packing slip or click the button PICK AND PACK/Journals/ 
Packing slip in the action pane of the sales order form. After selecting a packing slip 
on the tab Overview of the inquiry form, you can switch to the tab Lines to view the 
related packing slip lines. 
If you want to view related transactions in the general ledger, open the voucher 
transactions form by clicking the button Vouchers in the action pane of the packing 
slip inquiry (or the button Ledger/Physical voucher in the inventory transactions). 
4.5.4.4 Canceling a Packing Slip 
You can cancel a posted packing slip using the Cancel feature in the packing slip 
inquiry form (Sales and marketing> Sales orders> Order shipping> Packing slip). After 
selecting the particular packing slip, click the button Cancel in the action pane. If 
you just want to reduce the posted quantity, click the button Correct. 
4.5.5 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 4.9 – Packing Slip 
You want to check which order lines which are available for shipping. The inquiry 
should not be limited to your orders, but also include other orders available in 
your company. Which options do you know? 

4.6  Sales Invoice 
161 
Knowing your order of exercise 4.6 is among the orders to be shipped, you want to 
post the packing slip. Before posting, check following items in the sales order: 
 Order status and document status 
 Inventory quantity of the ordered item (button Inventory/On-hand inventory) 
 Inventory transactions related to the order line (button Inventory/Transactions) 
Post and print a packing slip for the complete order quantity in the sales order 
form, selecting a print preview as print destination. 
Now review the status of the points in the list above again. What is different after 
packing slip posting? 
Exercise 4.10 – Picking List 
Your customer of exercise 4.1 orders another 20 units of the item entered in 
exercise 3.5. Enter an appropriate sales order. 
Your warehouse requires a picking list this time. Post and print a picking list 
containing 10 units of the ordered item. Can you tell which setting controls if you 
need to enter picking list registration? If required, update the picking list 
registration. 
Then post the packing slip for the picked items. 
Exercise 4.11 – Packing Slip Inquiry 
You want to view the packing slip of exercise 4.10. Open the packing slip inquiry 
from the sales order form. In a second step, open the packing slip inquiry through 
the appropriate menu path. Check the packing slip header and the lines and try to 
find out, if there are related ledger transactions. 
4.6 
Sales Invoice 
Posting the sales invoice is the last step in sales order processing. The invoice 
increases the open customer balance and reduces the financial value of inventory. 
After invoicing all lines of a sales order, the sales order is completed. Payment of 
invoices then runs through a separate process in finance (see section 9.3.4). 
If you want to invoice inventoried products, you have to process a sales order. But 
it is not required to go through the complete process including order confirmation, 
picking, and shipping – you can post the sales order invoice immediately after 
entering the order. 
Free text invoices apply, if you want to post an invoice not referring to products or 
sales categories. In the lines of a free text invoice, you have to enter ledger accounts 
instead of item numbers. Free text invoices have no connection to items and no 
impact on inventory and supply chain management. 
4.6.1 
Sales Order Invoice 
The way of posting a sales invoice is similar to posting the packing slip. 

162 
4  Sales and Distribution 
4.6.1.1 Posting Dialog for Sales Order Invoices 
You can access the posting dialog for invoices by clicking the button INVOICE/ 
Generate/Invoice in the action pane of the sales order form or through the menu item 
Accounts receivable> Invoices> Batch invoicing> Invoice. 
The posting dialog shows the familiar format. The applicable option in the lookup 
field Quantity on the tab Parameters is depending on the prior process: 
 Packing Slip – Usual option, since in most cases a packing slip is posted first 
and you want to invoice the shipped quantity. 
 All or Deliver now – If selected, Dynamics AX does not initialize the column 
Update in the invoice lines with the shipped quantity. For any quantity not 
shipped yet, the physical transaction is posted in parallel to the invoice. 
If you choose the option “Packing Slip” in the lookup Quantity, the button Select 
packing slip in the toolbar on the tab Overview of the posting dialog provides the 
option to select or deselect particular packing slips for invoicing. 
Before posting, you can click the button Totals on the tab Overview of the posting 
dialog to check the totals. Then make sure that the sliders Posting and Print invoice 
in the posting dialog are set to “Yes” before clicking the button OK in order to post 
and print the invoice. 
4.6.1.2 Transaction Inquiry 
Posting the invoice generates general ledger transactions, inventory transactions, 
customer transactions, and transactions in other subledgers like sales tax as 
applicable. Once all lines of an order are completely invoiced, the order status 
changes to “Invoiced”. 
If you want to view the inventory transactions in the sales order form after posting 
the invoice, click the button Inventory/Transactions in the toolbar of the order lines. 
After posting the invoice, the issue status of the inventory transaction is “Sold” and 
the posting date of the invoice shows in the column Financial date. 
In order to view the posted sales invoices, open the form Accounts receivable> 
Inquiries and reports> Invoices> Invoice journal or click the button INVOICE/Journals/ 
Invoice in the action pane of the sales order form. Clicking an invoice number 
shown as link in the grid opens the related invoice detail form where you can view 
the invoice lines on the tab Lines. 
If you want to view corresponding transactions in the general ledger, open the 
voucher transactions form by clicking the button Voucher in the invoice inquiry (or 
the button Ledger/Financial voucher in the inventory transactions). 
4.6.1.3 Transaction Origin 
Clicking the button Transaction origin in the voucher transactions form opens the 
transaction origin form, which shows related transactions for the voucher in all 

4.6  Sales Invoice 
163 
modules. Figure 4-21 for example shows the invoice for an item, which has been 
shipped with a prior packing slip. 
 
Figure 4-21: Transactions of a sales invoice in the transaction origin form 
When classifying the transactions of the invoice shown in Figure 4-21, you have to 
distinguish between following transactions types: 
Table 4-2: 
Transactions of the sales invoice in Figure 4-21

[4b] 
Invoice posting only reverses packing slip transactions, if a prior packing slip has 
been posted to the general ledger. 
The particular ledger accounts in all transactions are depending on the actual 
procedure and on the applicable setup. For this reason, there may be more or fewer 
transactions if comparing the transactions in Figure 4-21 with other invoices. For 
example, there are no sales tax transactions in invoices to foreign countries. 
The customer summary account related to the customer transaction is specified in 
the applicable customer posting profile, which works similar to the vendor posting 
profile (see section 3.2.3). Apart from the sales tax transaction, settings for the other 
transactions are available in the inventory posting setup (see section 9.4.2). 

164 
4  Sales and Distribution 
4.6.2 
Collective Invoice 
If you want to post an invoice related to multiple sales orders (e.g. a monthly 
invoice), you have to post a collective invoice in a summary update. Collective 
documents are available for all document types. Apart from collective invoices, 
you can also post collective packing slips for example. 
The way to post collective documents is not different from posting an individual 
document. Settings at company and at customer level control, whether to generate 
a collective document. 
4.6.2.1 Setup for Summary Update 
The tab Summary update in the accounts receivable parameters contains basic 
configuration settings for collective sales documents. The core setting there is the 
lookup field Default values for summary update. In most cases, the best choice is 
“Automatic summary” which allows deselecting orders from a collective 
document in the order form. If the option “Invoice account” is selected, you can 
only exclude a particular order by removing it in the posting dialog. 
Clicking the button Summary update parameters on the sub-tab Summary update of 
the accounts receivable parameters tab Summary update displays the summary 
update parameters form. This form contains a separate tab per document type with 
the setting, which sales order fields must have the same content to join a collective 
document. 
If the option “Automatic summary” is selected in the parameter field Default values 
for summary update, you have to enabled automatic summary on the particular 
customers (button CUSTOMER/Setup/Summary update in the customer form). The 
setting on the customer is the default for sales orders, where you can change it 
after clicking the button GENERAL/Setup/Summary in the sales order form. 
4.6.2.2 Posting Collective Invoices 
In order to post a collective invoice, open the summary update dialog Accounts 
receivable> Invoices> Batch invoicing> Invoice. In most cases, the option “Packing slip” 
in the lookup field Quantity of the posting dialog is the right choice, making sure 
that the invoice only covers shipped quantities. 
In the posting dialog, first click the button Select [1] as shown in Figure 4-22 in 
order to select appropriate sales orders in the advanced filter dialog. After closing 
the filter dialog, the selected orders show on the tab Overview of the posting dialog. 
If there are orders which you do not want to invoice, click the button Remove in the 
toolbar of the tab Overview to delete the respective lines. Deleting a line in the 
posting dialog only removes the selection. It does not delete the order or the 
packing slip, which is why the order will show again, whenever you want to post 
an appropriate invoice the next time. 

4.6  Sales Invoice 
165 
If you want to include or exclude particular packing slips from invoice posting, 
click the button Select packing slip [2]. 
 
Figure 4-22: Posting a collective invoice receipt 
Once you have finished selecting sales orders and packing slips, click the button 
Arrange [3]. Arranging combines the orders into a common invoice according to the 
summary update parameters. If the setting in the accounts receivable parameters is 
not suitable when posting a particular invoice, you can choose a different option in 
the lookup Summary update for on the tab Parameters before arranging. 
In the example shown in Figure 4-22, the Arrange feature will merge the two orders 
into one common line. Clicking the button OK in the posting dialog afterwards 
posts the collective invoice. 
4.6.3 
Free Text Invoice 
Free text invoices are used to invoice a customer for intangible items without order 
processing. The structure of free text invoices is similar to sales orders: Every free 
text invoice consists of a header and one or more lines. But instead of product 
numbers and sales categories, the lines of a free text invoice contain main accounts. 
Entering a negative invoice amount in the free text invoice creates a credit note. But 
free text invoices and free text credit notes are not included in item statistics and 
inventory valuation. 

166 
4  Sales and Distribution 
Once you have finished entering the free text invoice, you can post and print it. 
The invoice is the only document which you can post in a free text invoice, it is not 
possible to post other documents (e.g. an order confirmation). 
 
Figure 4-23: Registering an invoice line of a free text invoice 
4.6.3.1 Registering Free Text Invoices 
In order to enter a free text invoice, open the form Accounts receivable> Invoices> All 
free text invoices and click the button New in the action pane. Alternatively, you can 
access the customer form and create a free text invoice by clicking the button 
INVOICE/New/Free text invoice in action pane there. 
Unlike the sales order form, the free text invoice does not show a separate Create 
new dialog when creating a new invoice starting in the free text invoice list page. 
But it provides the option to select the customer in the lines view, showing the 
fields Customer account and the Invoice account on the tab Free text invoice header.  
Then you can enter the lines with Description, Main account, and Amount (or 
Quantity and Unit price). If a line requires a longer description, you can enter it in 
the invoice text field on the sub-tab General of the tab Line details. If sales tax (VAT) 
applies, make sure to choose a correct Sales tax group and Item sales tax group. 
If you sell a fixed asset, enter the Fixed asset number on the sub-tab General of the tab 
Line details. 
In order to update financial dimensions (e.g. department or cost center), switch to 
the sub-tab Financial dimensions line on the tab Line details and enter applicable 

4.6  Sales Invoice 
167 
dimension values individually or by selecting a financial dimension default 
template in the lookup Template ID. 
4.6.3.2 Posting and Inquiry 
In order to post the free text invoice, click the button Post in the action pane of the 
free text invoice form. After posting, you can view the posted invoice by clicking 
the button INVOICE/Related information/Invoice journal in the action pane. 
In the inquiry Accounts receivable> Inquiries and reports> Invoices> Invoice journal, free 
text invoices display in parallel to sales order invoices. You can recognize free text 
invoices in this inquiry by the missing order number and by different invoice 
numbers (if a separate number sequence applies). 
4.6.3.3 Recurring Free Text Invoices 
If you want to issue a particular free text invoice periodically, you can use 
recurring free text invoices. As a prerequisite for this kind of invoices, set up a free 
text invoice template (Accounts receivable> Invoices> Recurring invoices> Free text 
invoice templates). Then you can assign customers to one or more templates by 
clicking the button INVOICE/Set up/Recurring invoices in the customer form. 
In order to generate a periodical free text invoice then, open the menu item 
Accounts receivable> Invoices> Recurring invoices> Generate recurring invoices. The 
periodic activity generates regular free text invoices, which you can access in the 
free text invoice form before posting. 
4.6.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 4.12 – Invoice 
You want to invoice the items shipped in exercise 4.9. Before posting the invoice, 
check following items: 
 Order status and document status of the sales order 
 Inventory transaction related to the order line (button Inventory/Transactions) 
Post and print the invoice directly in the sales order for and check the invoice total 
in the posting dialog before posting. 
Now review the status of the points in the list above again. What is different now? 
Exercise 4.13 – Partial Invoice 
You want to invoice the items picked and shipped in exercise 4.10. Post and print 
the invoice in the sales order form, making sure to invoice only shipped items. 
Exercise 4.14 – Shipping with Invoice 
Your customer of exercise 4.1 orders another unit of the product entered in exercise 
3.5. In addition, he wants to order one hour of the installation service entered in 
exercise 4.3 for a price of USD 110. This time you do not post a packing slip, you 
want to ship the items with the invoice. 

168 
4  Sales and Distribution 
Enter an appropriate sales order and immediately post the invoice. After posting 
the invoice, review the order status, the document status, and the inventory 
transaction of the product. 
Exercise 4.15 – Invoice Inquiry 
You want to view the invoice posted in exercise 4.12. Open the invoice inquiry and 
check the invoice header and lines as well as the related ledger transactions. 
In exercise 4.2, you were looking for the summary account for your customer. Can 
you find the ledger transaction on this account? Finally, open the transaction origin 
form and check, to which modules your invoice has been posting. 
Exercise 4.16 – Free Text Invoice 
You want to invoice specific services, for which no product or sales category is 
available, to your customer of exercise 4.1. Enter a free text invoice choosing an 
appropriate revenue account and post the invoice. What is the difference between 
a free text invoice and a sales order invoice? 
4.7 
Sales Credit Note and Item Return 
Credit notes are documents issued when a customer returns an item to your 
company and receives a replacement or a financial compensation. You can also 
post a credit note if the customer does not actually return defective items, or if you 
have to credit a price variance. 
In order to manage customer returns, you can use the return order management in 
Dynamics AX. In case of a simple return process, you can use regular sales orders 
instead of return orders. 
If a credit note does not refer to the delivered items, you can use a free text invoice. 
4.7.1 
Return Order Management 
Return orders support a proper procedure for item returns, making sure that a 
customer has to contact you and receives a return merchandise authorization 
(RMA) before returning a product. 
4.7.1.1 Disposition Codes and Required Setup 
As a prerequisite for using return orders, you have to set up disposition codes 
(Sales and marketing> Setup> Returns> Disposition codes). The core setting in the 
disposition code is the field Action, which controls the handling of a defective item: 
 Credit only – Credit without item return 
 Credit (or Scrap) – Return items and credit 
 Replace and credit (or Replace and scrap) – Return items and replace 
 Return to customer – Do not credit 

4.7  Sales Credit Note and Item Return

If scrap applies, an item receipt has to be posted anyhow (similar to an item receipt 
for products returned to stock). But in parallel to the packing slip transaction of the 
return order, Dynamics AX posts an inventory transaction for scrapping. 
Apart from disposition codes, a number sequence with the reference Area “Order 
management” and the Reference “RMA number” is required for return orders. 
4.7.1.2 Return Order Registration 
Return orders are sales orders of the type “Returned order”, showing the sales 
order number in the return order header. But except for return orders referring to 
the disposition code “Credit only”, return orders do not show in the regular sales 
order form until posting the item arrival. 
In order to access return orders from the menu, open the list page Sales and 
marketing> Sales returns> All return orders. When creating a return order by clicking 
the button New in the action pane, you can optionally select a Return reason code in 
the header (used for statistical purposes and to assign charges automatically if 
applicable). 
The Sales return processing workspace, which you can access from the dashboard, 
shows an overview of return orders. Clicking the tile All return orders in the left 
pane provides access to the return order list page. In the workspace, you can create 
a new return order by clicking the button New/Return order in the action pane. The 
following steps are the same as when creating an order from the return order form. 
 
Figure 4-24: Registering an item in the return order form 
Clicking the button RETURN ORDER/Return/Find sales order in the action pane 
provides the option to copy posted sales invoice lines into the return order. 

170 
4  Sales and Distribution 
Alternatively, you can manually enter return order lines with a negative quantity. 
The Disposition code for a line is available on the sub-tab General of the Line details 
tab. But except for disposition codes with the Action “Credit only” (crediting 
without physical return), the disposition code remains empty until the item arrival. 
Optionally, you can click the button RETURN ORDER/Send/Return order in the 
return order to print a RMA document which you can send to your customer. 
If you want to send an up-front replacement for the returned item to the customer, 
create an appropriate sales order by clicking the button RETURN ORDER/New/ 
Replacement order in the action pane of the return order. 
4.7.1.3 Return Orders without Physical Returns 
If you do not want your customer to return the item, choose a disposition code 
without item return (“Credit only”) on the sub-tab General of the Line details tab in 
the return order. In this case, you can immediately post the credit note in the sales 
order form (Sales and marketing> Sales Orders> All sales orders) or in the summary 
update Accounts receivable> Invoices> Batch invoicing> Invoice. 
4.7.1.4 Return Orders – Item Arrival and Credit Note 
Once receiving the items of a return order, you have to record inventory 
registration. Like the inventory registration in purchasing (see section 3.5.3), the 
registration for return orders can be done in the registration form (button Update 
line/Registration in the return order lines) or in the item arrival journal. In a 
warehouse applying advanced warehouse management, inventory registration is 
done through mobile device transactions. 
If you use the item arrival journal (Inventory management> Journal entries> Item 
arrival> Item arrival, see section 7.4.2), select the option “Sales order” in the lookup 
Reference and enter the RMA number in the dialog when creating a new journal. 
You can update this reference, which is a default for the journal lines, on the tab 
Default values in the journal header view. In addition, you can enter a Disposition 
code in the header as default value for the journal lines. 
In order to create journal lines in the item arrival journal, either click the button 
Functions/Create lines in the journal header, or enter them manually in the lines 
view of the journal. 
The disposition code has to be specified in the journal lines before you can post the 
item return. If it is not possible to decide on the disposition code when receiving 
the item, set the slider Quarantine management in the journal line to “Yes” (default 
from the journal header) and leave the disposition code empty. Dynamics AX then 
creates a quarantine order (see section 7.4.6) when posting the item arrival. You do 
not have to enter the disposition code before ending quarantine in this case. 
After posting the item arrival journal by clicking the button Post, the status of the 
return order line is updated to “Registered”. 

4.7  Sales Credit Note and Item Return 
171 
Once you have finished inventory registration, you can optionally print a receipt 
acknowledgement by clicking the button RETURN ORDER/Send/Acknowledgement 
in the return order form. 
Then post the packing slip (showing a negative quantity) in the return order form 
(button RETURN ORDER/Generate/Packing slip) or in the sales order form (button 
PICK AND PACK/Generate/Packing slip) and make sure to select an appropriate 
option in the lookup Quantity of the posting dialog. 
In order to credit the customer financially, open the sales order form and click the 
button INVOICE/Generate/Invoice in the action pane, or choose the summary update 
Accounts receivable> Invoices> Batch invoicing> Invoice. 
4.7.2 
Simple Credit Note 
If you do not want to process a customer return applying the steps in a return 
order, you can credit a customer through a regular sales order. Apart from the 
sales order, the free text invoice is another option for crediting. 
4.7.2.1 Credit Note from a Sales Order 
Since the order type “Returned order” is not available for manual selection, the 
order header of a crediting order looks like the header of a regular sales order. In 
the sales order form, there are following options for crediting: 
 Original order line – Negative Deliver now quantity 
 New order line – Order line with a negative quantity in the original order 
 New order – Order line with a negative quantity in a new sales order 
The options for registering a new order or a new line are similar to purchasing (see 
section 3.4.2). 
If you want to register a credit note in the original order line, enter a negative 
quantity in the column Deliver now of the respective sales order line. When posting 
the credit note, choose the option “Deliver now” – which refers to the Deliver now 
column – in the Quantity lookup field of the invoice posting dialog. 
4.7.2.2 Inventory Valuation for Returned Items 
If registering a credit note in a new order or order line, you should select the 
original invoice number in the lookup field Return lot ID (on the sub-tab Setup of 
the tab Line details) of the order line before posting. This link ensures that the 
inventory value of the crediting line exactly matches the inventory value of the 
original delivery. 
Dynamics AX automatically applies the return lot ID, if you create a credit note 
line by clicking the button RETURN ORDER/Return/Find sales order in the return 
order form, or the button SELL/Create/Credit note in the sales order form. 
If you do not select a return lot ID, Dynamics AX applies the Return cost price on 
the sub-tab Setup of the crediting order line for inventory valuation. 

172 
4  Sales and Distribution 
4.7.2.3 Scrapping Items 
If you do not want the customer to return a defective item, set the slider Scrap on 
the sub-tab Setup of the order line to “Yes”. When posting the invoice (credit note), 
Dynamics AX posts the item receipt and a related inventory loss at the same time. 
In return orders, the checkbox Scrap is controlled by the disposition code. 
4.7.2.4 Refunds not Referring to Returns 
The free text invoice form (see section 4.6.3) is an option to register and post 
customer refunds. But if a refund refers to an item, you should not use a free text 
invoice, since this kind of invoicing is not included in item statistics and inventory 
valuation. 
In case of crediting a price variance, rather enter a new sales order containing one 
line with a negative quantity and the old price and one line with a positive 
quantity and the right price. Clicking the button Inventory/Marking (see section 
3.7.1) provides the option to link these transactions (offsetting the inventory value). 
4.7.3 
Case Study Exercise 
Exercise 4.17 – Credit Note 
Your customer complains about defects on the items invoiced in exercise 4.12. You 
agree to accept an item return and to credit the invoice. Enter an appropriate 
return order and post the item receipt applying a suitable disposition code. After 
posting the packing slip return, you want to post and print the credit note. 
4.8 
Direct Delivery 
Direct delivery means shipping goods from a vendor directly to a customer. 
Avoiding a warehouse in between saves time and expenses for transportation and 
stocking. 
4.8.1 
Processing Direct Deliveries 
The functionality for direct deliveries in Dynamics AX is based on a purchase 
order which is created from a related sales order. There are three options for 
creating this purchase order: 
 Create purchase order – Creating a regular purchase order from the sales order 
 Create direct delivery – Creating a direct delivery from the sales order 
 Direct delivery workbench – Creating a direct delivery from the workbench 
Whereas creating a regular purchase order or a direct delivery purchase order 
from the sales order does not require specific settings, the direct delivery 
workbench requires marking a sales order line for direct delivery. 

4.8  Direct Delivery 
173 
4.8.1.1 Regular Purchase Order form the Sales Order 
Creating a regular purchase order from the sales order is an option which is useful 
if you want to process the purchase order separately from other orders, but 
nevertheless receive and ship it through a warehouse of your company. 
When entering the sales order, there is no difference to a regular order. Once you 
have finished entering the order, create a related purchase order by clicking the 
button SALES ORDER/New/Purchase order in the action pane. 
In the Create purchase order dialog, you have to select the checkbox Include and to 
choose a vendor (if no main vendor is specified in the item). Processing the 
purchase order and the sales order works like processing regular orders, including 
change management for the purchase order. 
In the purchase order, the delivery address for the vendor is the warehouse or 
company address (like in any regular purchase order). You can post the product 
receipt in your warehouse and then perform picking and shipping to the customer. 
4.8.1.2 Direct Delivery from the Sales Order 
In case of a direct delivery, the sales order again is not different from regular sales 
orders. But selecting a separate warehouse for direct deliveries is useful to avoid 
mixing direct deliveries and regular inventory transactions in the warehouse. 
 
Figure 4-25: Printing a sales packing slip when posting the product receipt 
The button SALES ORDER/New/Direct delivery in the action pane of the sales order 
generates a purchase order like the Create purchase order option, but creates a 
tighter link between the orders. The delivery address of the purchase order is the 
customer address, modifications of the address and other data in the sales order 
which are relevant to purchasing (e.g. the quantity or the delivery date) are 

174 
4  Sales and Distribution 
synchronized to the purchase order. In case of changes you have to observe the 
purchase order change management, at least requiring a confirmation of the 
modified purchase order. 
When posting the product receipt for a direct delivery in purchasing, 
Dynamics AX automatically posts the related sales packing slip. If you are required 
to print a packing slip for the customer, set the slider Print sales documents in the 
posting dialog for the product receipt to “Yes” (see Figure 4-25). Invoice posting in 
sales is independent from the purchase invoice. 
4.8.1.3 Direct Delivery Workbench 
The direct delivery workbench gives an overview of all sales orders with direct 
delivery and allows processing the related purchase and sales orders. 
In order to use the direct delivery workbench, make sure the slider Direct delivery 
on the sub-tab Delivery of the sales order line is set to “Yes” (default from the 
released product, tab Delivery). In addition, the item must have a main vendor. 
In the direct delivery workbench (Procurement and sourcing> Purchase orders> Direct 
delivery processing> Direct delivery), the sales order initially shows on the tab Direct 
delivery. Clicking the button Create direct delivery in the toolbar of this tab creates 
the purchase order. This purchase order – like any direct delivery purchase orders 
created independently from the workbench – shows on the tab Confirmation, where 
you can post the purchase order confirmation. The tab Delivery finally provides the 
option to post the product receipt (together with the packing slip). 
4.8.1.4 Links between Purchase and Sales Order 
If you want to know the sales order line linked to a purchase order line (or the 
purchase order line linked to a sales order line), check the Item reference on the sub-
tab Product of the purchase or sales order line. In the header of purchase orders or 
sales orders, the reference is shown after clicking the button GENERAL/Related 
information/Related orders in the action pane. In addition, you can click the button 
GENERAL/Related information/Purchase order in the action pane of the sales order 
form if you want to access the assigned purchase order directly. 
4.8.2 
Case Study Exercise 
Exercise 4.18 – Direct Delivery 
Your customer of exercise 4.1 orders 100 units of the item entered in exercise 3.5. In 
order to avoid stocking this large quantity in your warehouse, you want to process 
a direct delivery. Enter an appropriate sales order and choose the option Direct 
delivery for generating a purchase order to your vendor of exercise 3.2. 
Your vendor confirms shipping the item with packing slip PS418. You want to post 
this product receipt in the purchase order. In the next step, check the status of the 
sales order, then post and print the sales invoice. After receiving the purchase 
invoice VI418, post the invoice receipt. 

4.9  Trade Allowance and Incentive Management 
175 
4.9 
Trade Allowance and Incentive Management 
Customer rebates and trade allowances are contracts, which specify a discount 
depending on the sales volume. Usually the customer receives a credit note or a 
payment at the end of a period if the total sales amount or quantity meets the 
target as agreed in the rebate contract. 
Incentive management in Dynamics AX does not only cover customer agreements, 
but also agreements with vendors, broker contracts, and royalty contracts: 
 Customer rebates – Rebate contracts with customers 
 Trade allowances – Enhancement of the customer rebates 
 Vendor rebates – Rebate functionality in purchasing (similar to sales) 
 Broker contracts – Payment of agents (vendors) based upon the sales revenue 
with particular customers 
 Royalty contracts – Payment of royalty owners (vendors) based upon the sales 
volume of particular items 
Customer rebate agreements (Sales and marketing> Customer rebates> Rebate 
agreements) with the rebate program type “Rebate” and “TMA” work similar to the 
bill back trade allowance agreement described below. 
4.9.1 
Trade Allowance 
Trade allowance agreements in Dynamics AX support the calculation and payment 
of rebates, and the analysis of the profitability of promotions. You can group trade 
allowances in Dynamics AX into three categories: 
 Bill back – Allowances based upon the posted invoices in a period, paid to the 
order customer or the invoice customer 
 Lump sum – Allowances paid upfront to an agent (vendor or customer) 
 Invoicing rebate – Allowance immediately deducted from the sales invoice 
4.9.1.1 Required Setup for Trade Allowances 
As a prerequisite for using trade allowances, you have to set up at least one 
customer hierarchy containing the customers which are subject to trade 
allowances. You can access the customer hierarchies in the form Sales and 
marketing> Trade allowances> Customer category hierarchy, where you can click the 
button New to set up a new hierarchy. 
In the hierarchy, you can click the button New category node in the toolbar of the tab 
Categories to create a multilevel hierarchy structure. In order to assign or to view 
customers in a category node, click the button Add/remove customer. 
In the rebate program types (Sales and marketing> Customer rebates> Rebate program 
types), create at least one rebate program type with the Rebate program type “Bill 
back” and the applicable default accrual and expense account. 

176 
4  Sales and Distribution 
 
Figure 4-26: Managing customer hierarchy categories 
In the merchandising event categories (Sales and marketing> Setup> Trade allowance> 
Merchandising event category), create at least one category per applicable trade 
allowance type:  
 Bill back – Category with Default type “Bill back” 
 Lump sum – Category with Default type “Lump sum” 
 Invoicing rebate – Category with Default type “Off invoice” 
Following parameter settings apply to trade allowances: 
 Accounts receivable parameters – Select an AR consumption journal and a Rebate 
accrual journal (usually separate journal names in finance) on the tab Rebate 
program. In addition, set the slider Rebates at invoicing to “Yes” if you want to 
create a rebate transaction immediately when posting an applicable sales 
invoice. On the tab Number sequences, enter number sequences for the Reference 
“Rebate ID” and “Rebate agreement ID”. 
 Trade allowance management parameters (Sales and marketing> Setup> Trade 
allowance> Trade allowance management parameters) – Enter required number 
sequences and optionally select a default Customer hierarchy and a Default rebate 
program ID. If working with lump sum allowances, select an Expense account or a 
Procurement category for lump sum transactions. 
4.9.1.2 Funds and Optional Setup 
Trade allowance funds provide the budget for the costs caused by the trade 
allowances rebates. Although funds are not mandatory for using trade allowances, 
it is useful to apply them because they are required to check the profitability of 
sales promotions through rebates. In order to set up trade allowance funds, open 
the form Sales and marketing> Trade allowances> Funds> Funds. When creating a new 
fund, select the From date and the To date (specifying the validity period) and enter 
the budget amount in the field Fund budgeted. On the tabs Customers and Items, 
select the applicable customers and items for the particular fund. Then activate the 
fund by changing the Status to “Approved”. 

4.9  Trade Allowance and Incentive Management 
177 
Trade allowance agreement periods (Sales and marketing> Setup> Trade allowance> 
Trade allowance agreement period) provide the option to specify date intervals which 
you can use as default when entering trade allowance agreements. 
If you want to apply an approval process for trade allowance agreements, you can 
set up approval workflows in the menu item Sales and marketing> Setup> Trade 
allowance> Trade allowance workflows. 
4.9.1.3 Managing Trade Allowance Agreements 
Trade allowance agreements specify rebates for customers. In order to create a new 
agreement, open the menu item Sales and marketing> Trade allowances> Trade 
allowance agreements and click the button New in the action pane. Then enter a 
description and the validity dates (Order from and Order to is required), which 
specify the sales orders and invoices included in the rebate calculation. You can 
optionally select a Trade allowance agreement period as default for the validity dates. 
In the field group Analysis, you have to select the Unit before you can specify the 
sales target of the agreement. This target is given by entering the usual sales 
quantity without trade allowances in the Base units, and the intended increase in 
the Lift percent. The tabs Customers, Items, and Funds in the header view of the trade 
allowances provide the option to set default values for the trade allowance lines. 
 
Figure 4-27: Amount calculation settings in a bill back trade allowance agreement line 

178 
4  Sales and Distribution 
After switching to the lines view you should make sure that appropriate customers 
are selected on the tab Customers. On the sub-tab Merchandising event of the tab 
Agreement lines, add one or more lines with the applicable Category. After selecting 
a merchandising event line, switch to the other sub-tabs and enter event details as 
applicable. The sub-tab Amounts contains the allowance calculation for the selected 
event line. Depending on whether the particular merchandising event line is linked 
to a Category with the Default type “Bill back”, “Lump sum”, or “Off invoice”, this 
sub-tab shows different fields. 
When entering the calculation details for a “Bill back” event, the Minimum quantity 
and Minimum amount on the sub-tab Amounts specify the minimum sales volume 
within the period selected in the field Cumulate sales by for a customer to be eligible 
for the allowance rebate. The Payment type defines if the order customer is credited, 
or if the invoice customer is credited, or if the customer receives a payment 
(reimbursement through accounts payable by paying a vendor who is associated 
with the customer). The Trade allowance lines pane contains the rebate calculation, 
in the column Amount type specifying whether the Value is an amount or a 
percentage. You can enter multiple trade allowance lines in case the allowance 
percentage or amount is depending on the sales volume. The field Rebate line break 
type in the field group Limits determines whether the From qty and the To qty in the 
lines are quantities or amounts. 
Once you have finished entering the trade allowance agreement, click the button 
Confirmed in the action pane to activate the agreement. 
If you have to set up similar trade allowance agreements multiple times, you can 
create a template (Sales and marketing> Trade allowances> Templates) in a similar way 
to setting up a trade allowance. Clicking the button Create trade allowances in the 
template creates a new trade allowance as a copy of the template. 
4.9.1.4 Processing Lump Sum Agreements 
Lump sum agreements are one-time payments or credit notes which fund sales 
promotion activities of customers or vendors. In order to set up a lump sum 
agreement, enter a merchandising event line in a trade allowance agreement as 
described above. In comparison to bill back events, the sub-tab Amounts for lump 
sum events only shows the fields Amount (for the claim amount) and the Payment 
type (specifying whether the allowance is credited to a customer or paid to a 
vendor). 
Once the trade allowance agreement is confirmed, you can credit or pay the claim 
by clicking the button Approve in the toolbar on the sub-tab Amounts. If the Payment 
type is “Customer deductions”, Dynamics AX creates a customer invoice (credit 
note) for the customer in the field Pay to (applying the expense account specified in 
the trade allowance parameters). If the Payment type is “Pay using accounts 

4.9  Trade Allowance and Incentive Management 
179 
payable”, Dynamics AX creates a vendor invoice for the vendor in the field Pay to 
(applying the procurement category specified in the trade allowance parameters). 
You can view the customer invoice (or the vendor invoice) in the (open) 
transactions of the particular customer or vendor. 
4.9.1.5 Processing Bill Back Agreements 
Bill back agreement rebates are based on sales invoices and apply to the customers 
and items specified in the agreement. Depending on the slider Rebates at invoicing 
on the tab Rebate program in the accounts receivable parameters, Dynamics AX 
immediately creates rebate entries when posting an invoice. If this slider is set to 
“No”, you have to execute the periodic activity Sales and marketing> Customer 
rebate> Rebate update> Calculate rebates to create rebate entries. 
You can manage the rebate entries related to a bill back agreement in the bill back 
workbench (Sales and marketing> Trade allowances> Bill back workbench). At the end of 
the trade allowance cumulating period, calculate the rebate amounts by clicking 
the button Cumulate in this form or through the periodic activity Sales and 
marketing> Customer rebate> Rebate update> Cumulate rebates. Then approve the 
rebates by clicking the button Approve after selecting the lines for approval in the 
grid. Finally click the button Process to generate rebate transactions. Processing sets 
the rebate status to “Mark” and posts accrual transactions. 
 
Figure 4-28: Calculating rebates in the bill back workbench 
In the next step, access the open transactions of the customers receiving a rebate 
(button COLLECT/Settle/Settle transactions in the action pane of the customer form). 
In the Settle open transactions form, click the button Functions/Bill back program and 
select the checkbox Mark in the rebate lines to be credited. If the rebate should be 
processed as a credit note in sales, click the button Functions/Create credit note. In 
case the rebate is to be paid, click the button Functions/Pass to AP to create an open 
vendor transaction which is included in the next payment proposal. 
After crediting or paying the customer, the rebate status shows “Completed”. 
4.9.1.6 Canceling and Purging Rebates 
If you do not want to pay or credit a rebate which is generated from a trade 
allowance agreement, cancel the rebate after processing it (Status “Mark”). After 

180 
4  Sales and Distribution 
clicking the button Cancel in the bill back workbench and specifying an appropriate 
filter in the dialog, the status of the selected rebate transaction is set to “Canceled” 
and related accrual transactions are reversed. 
Purging is used to clean up the bill back workbench, deleting all transactions 
which are finished (status “Completed” or “Canceled”). 
4.9.1.7 Deductions and One-Time Promotions 
You can use trade allowance deductions in case a customer does not want to wait 
for the rebate payout at period end and just pays a reduced amount indicating the 
deduction. As a prerequisite for using deductions, following setup is required: 
 Deduction journal name – Select a journal name in the trade allowance 
parameters for posting the deductions 
 Deduction types – Create at least one type with the related offset account in the 
form Sales and marketing> Trade allowances> Deductions> Deduction types 
 Deduction denial reasons – Create at least one reason in the form Sales and 
marketing> Trade allowances> Deductions> Deduction denial reasons 
 Deduction write-off reasons – Create reasons as applicable in the form Sales 
and marketing> Trade allowances> Deductions> Deduction write-off reasons 
Deductions are registered when entering customer payments in the payment 
journal (Accounts receivable> Payments> Payment journal) as described in section 
9.3.4. After entering a payment journal line which does not fully match the invoice 
amount, click the button Deductions on the very right of the toolbar in the journal 
lines. In the deductions form, create a new line with the deduction amount, the 
deduction type, and the trade allowance ID. The Balance fields in the lower pane of 
the deduction form show the balance of settled amount, payment, and deduction. 
After closing the deduction form, the payment journal shows an additional line for 
the entered deduction. Posting the payment journal posts a transaction for the 
payment and for the deduction lines. 
Open deductions display in the deduction workbench (Sales and marketing> Trade 
allowances> Deductions> Deduction workbench). Credit transactions for trade 
allowances, which are generated by processing the trade allowances for applicable 
bill back and lump sum agreements, are available for reconciliation in the lower 
pane of the deduction workbench. In order to match a deduction with a credit 
transaction in the deduction workbench, select the checkbox Mark in the 
appropriate deduction first, and mark applicable rebate transactions in the lower 
pane afterwards. Clicking the button Maintain/Match in the action pane posts a 
match transaction in a deduction journal. 
In case a deduction is incorrect, click the button Maintain/Deny in the action pane of 
the deduction workbench for reversing the deduction transaction. The denied 
amount then shows as open customer transaction. The button Maintain/Split 

4.9  Trade Allowance and Incentive Management 
181 
provides the option to split a deduction line, for example if you want to deny only 
part of the deduction. 
If you want to allow a one-time deduction for an amount exceeding the trade 
allowance agreement, you can post an additional promotion by clicking the button 
Maintain/Settle deduction as one-time promotion. Click the button OK and optionally 
add a fund in the dialog shown next. The one-time promotion is posted as a lump 
sum transaction based on the trade allowance template selected as One-time 
promotion template in the trade allowance parameters. 
4.9.1.8 Analyzing Trade Allowance Agreements 
In the trade allowance agreement form, you can click the button Analysis in the 
action pane to view the results of a trade allowance agreement. In addition, the 
form Sales and marketing> Trade allowances> Trade allowance analysis> Trade allowance 
activity shows the detailed sales transactions and costs related to an agreement. 
4.9.1.9 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
In the new release, trade allowance management is not a separate module but 
included in the sales and marketing module. Minor additional changes include the 
option to apply sales tax/VAT to all trade allowance types. 
4.9.2 
Vendor Rebate 
Rebate and trade allowance agreements are not only available in the sales module. 
You can also manage rebate agreements with your vendors in Dynamics AX. 
The setup of vendor rebate agreements (Procurement and sourcing> Vendor rebates> 
Rebate agreements) is similar to the setup of customer rebate agreements and trade 
allowance agreements. The form Procurement and sourcing> Vendor rebates> Rebate 
claims is used to process vendor rebates. 
The required configuration for vendor rebate agreements is available in the 
procurement and sourcing parameters, and in the forms of the menu item folder 
Procurement and sourcing> Vendor rebates. 
4.9.3 
Broker Contract 
Broker contracts support agreements with agents (vendors), which require to pay 
the agent based upon your sales revenue with selected customers and items. 
4.9.3.1 Required Setup for Broker Contracts 
As a prerequisite for broker contracts, you have to set up at least one charges code 
(Ledger – Ledger) for broker charges in the accounts receivable charges (Accounts 
receivable> Charges setup> Charges code). This code is used for posting the broker 
charges when posting a sales invoice. 
In the Accounts payable parameters, select appropriate journal names and an expense 
account for the broker claim on the tab Broker and royalty. In the Accounts payable 

182 
4  Sales and Distribution 
parameters, select a number sequence for the Broker claim invoice on the tab Number 
sequences. 
4.9.3.2 Entering and Processing Broker Contracts 
Since the broker is a vendor, access the accounts payable module to manage the 
broker contracts (Accounts payable> Broker and royalties> Broker contracts). When 
setting up a broker contract, select the broker and a default for the charges code in 
the upper pane of the form. In the lower pane, specify which items and customers 
are covered by the broker agreement. Break type and Break in the line determine the 
minimum quantity or amount for applying a broker charge. Depending on the 
Category selected in the upper pane, the Charges value is a percentage or an amount. 
You can enter multiple lines in the lower pane if there are different charges 
depending on the sales quantity or amount. The contract is effective once the Status 
is set to “Approved”. 
When entering a sales order line covered by the broker contract, you can view the 
calculated broker commission by clicking the button Sales order line/Broker 
commission in the toolbar of the sales order line. Clicking the button 
Financials/Maintain charges in sales order line provides access to the related charges 
transaction. When posting the sales order invoice, the charges transaction posts an 
accrual transaction and a broker contract claim. 
In the broker claims (Accounts payable> Broker and royalties> Broker claims), you can 
view the claims generated in sales. In order to pay a claim, make sure that the 
checkbox Mark is selected (select it manually in the upper pane or click the button 
Mark all) and click the button Approve. Approving posts a reversal of the accrual 
and a vendor invoice with the broker expense. 
4.9.4 
Royalty Agreement 
Royalty agreements in Dynamics AX support contracts with royalty owners 
(vendors), which require to pay a fee (e.g. a license fee) to the royalty owner based 
upon your sales of selected items. Royalty contracts work similar to vendor rebate 
agreements, but they are based on the customer invoice transactions covered by 
the royalty agreement. 
The required setup for royalty contracts includes settings on the tabs Broker and 
royalty and Number sequences in the accounts payable parameters. 
Royalty contracts are available in the form Accounts payable> Broker and royalties> 
Royalty agreements. The form Accounts payable> Broker and royalties> Royalty claims is 
used to manage the calculation.

Production Control 
The primary responsibility of production control is to manufacture finished goods. 
In order to perform this task, production consumes material and resource capacity 
(men and machinery). The manufacturing process may cover multiple levels of 
semi-finished products in the bill of materials of the manufactured product. 
5.1 
Business Processes in Manufacturing 
Depending on the requirements of your company, you can choose to apply 
following manufacturing concepts in Dynamics AX: 
 Discrete manufacturing – Core production functionality, including bills of 
materials (BOMs), resources, routes, and production orders 
 Process manufacturing – Supports the additional requirements of batch-
producing industries like formulas and batch production orders 
 Lean manufacturing – Supports production flows and Kanbans (completely 
independent from routes and production orders) 
You can apply these concepts in mixed mode, for example using process 
manufacturing for components and lean manufacturing for finished products. 
This book primarily covers the core production functionality used in discrete 
manufacturing, and gives an overview of process manufacturing. Before we start 
to go into details, the lines below give an overall picture of discrete manufacturing. 
5.1.1 
Basic Approach 
Like in purchasing and in sales, correct master data are an essential prerequisite for 
successfully executing production control. 
5.1.1.1 Master Data and Transactions in Production Control 
The released product record shows the main characteristics of an item. The bill of 
materials (BOM) then describes the structure of a finished (or semi-finished) item 
by specifying the components (materials, or lower-level semi-finished items). 
Resources (machines or human resources) are another basic element, providing 
capacity for manufacturing. Routes and operations, which describe the necessary 
activities to manufacture an item, determine the required resources. 
Products, BOMs, resources, and routes are master data, only occasionally updated 
after initially creating the individual records. In the course of production order 
processing, planned and actual production orders (transaction data) receive default 
values from these master data, which you can override in the transaction – for 
example selecting a non-standard bill of materials in a particular production order.

Production order processing in Dynamics AX 
5.1.1.2 Demand and Supply Planning 
In order to know the required quantity of finished products, the first step in the 
manufacturing process usually is to run master planning (see section 6.3). 
Depending on settings for scheduling, the item demand derives from sources like 
forecasts, sales quotations, sales orders, or settings for a minimum stock. 
5.1.1.3 Creating a Production Order 
Master planning generates planned production orders for finished and semi-
finished products, which you can transfer to actual production orders. Apart from 
transferring planned orders, following options are available for creating a 
production order: 
 Manual – Entering an order in the production order form 
 Sales order – Creating a production order from a sales order line 
 Pegged supply – Automatically creating a production order for a semi-finished 
item (sub-production order) in the production order of a finished item 
 Project – Creating a production order in a project (project accounting module) 
A production order consists of an order header, which contains the manufactured 
item, and order lines. Unlike purchase and sales orders, which only include item 
lines, production orders contain two different types of lines: BOM item lines and 
route operation lines. These line types show in separate forms. 
After creating a production order, you have to execute all subsequent steps – from 
estimating to ending – one after the other. Depending on parameter settings, you 
can skip steps when processing a production order. 
5.1.1.4 Estimating and Scheduling 
After creating a production order, estimation is the first step in order processing. 
Estimation determines the quantity and cost of all items and resources which are 
required to manufacture the product. 
Whereas estimation calculates the item quantity and resource capacity demand 
without timing it, scheduling as the next step calculates exact production dates. 

5.1  Business Processes in Manufacturing 
185 
5.1.1.5 Releasing and Starting 
Releasing a production order means to hand it over from the front office to the 
shop floor. At this stage you can print the production papers as required.  
Once you want to begin with activities in the shop floor, you have to set the order 
status to “Started”. This status provides the option to consume items and 
resources. When starting an order, you can print the picking list and post the 
automatic consumption of items and resource capacity. 
5.1.1.6 Production Journals 
In the course of the manufacturing process, the shop floor consumes material and 
resource capacity. Production journals are used to report this consumption. 
Depending on the requirements, you can post the journals manually or backflush 
automatically (using estimation data). Alternatively, you can report consumption 
through terminals and mobile devices in the Dynamics AX Manufacturing execution. 
5.1.1.7 Reporting as Finished and Ending the Production Order 
Once manufacturing is completed for a partial quantity or the entire quantity of the 
finished product, post a “Report as finished” transaction. The reported quantity of 
the finished product is then available in inventory. Ending the production order is 
the last step in production order processing, calculating the actual costs of 
production and posting financial transactions in the general ledger. 
5.1.1.8 Ledger Integration and Voucher Principle 
Production journals, which record the consumption of materials and resources and 
the receipt of finished products, are posting physical transactions to the general 
ledger already before ending the order (see section 9.4.3). 
The voucher principle, which is the general principle for processing transactions in 
Dynamics AX, also applies to transactions in manufacturing: You have to register a 
transaction in a journal before you can post it.

Transactions and posted documents in production control

5.1.2 
At a Glance: Production Order Processing 
In order to provide an overview of the main steps in production order processing, 
this section shows the basics. In the example, we create an order starting in the 
Production floor management workspace and post all transactions directly in the 
production order form. Of course you can also create the order directly in the 
production order list page. 
In the Production floor management workspace, click the button Create new/ 
Production order in the action pane. The Create production order dialog shows next, 
where you have to select the Item number of the manufactured item. Dynamics AX 
initializes the quantity, BOM, and route in the production order with default 
values from this item. Clicking the button Create in the dialog creates a new 
production order. 
In the production order detail form, click the button Edit to switch to the edit mode 
if you are in view mode. If you want to view or edit the material components or 
the route operations of the order, click the button PRODUCTION ORDER/Order 
details/BOM (or PRODUCTION ORDER/Order details/Route) in the action pane. 
 
Figure 5-3: 
Managing a production order in the production order form 
In order to process the production order, change the order status by clicking 
following buttons in the action pane one after the other: 
 PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Estimate 
 SCHEDULE/Production order/Schedule operations or Schedule jobs 
 PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Release 
When changing the status, you can select applicable parameters on the first tab (or 
the tab General) in the update dialog – e.g. to select the scheduling direction when 

5.1  Business Processes in Manufacturing 
187 
scheduling, or to print the production papers when releasing. If you skip a step, it 
is automatically executed with the next step. Once the production order should be 
processed in the shop floor, click the button PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Start 
which starts the order and posts automatic material and route consumption as 
applicable. When starting the order, you can print the picking list. 
In order to enter the consumption of items configured for manual posting, click the 
button VIEW/Journals/Picking list in the action pane of the production order. In the 
journal list page, click the button Picking list/Create lines to generate a proposal with 
picking list lines. Selecting “Remaining quantity” in the lookup field Proposal of the 
Create lines dialog initializes the journal lines with the open quantity. You can edit 
the consumption quantity, the warehouse, and other data in the lines view of the 
journal detail form (access by clicking the journal ID shown as link in the grid of 
the journal list page) before you post the journal by clicking the button Post. 
Depending on the setup and on the scheduling type (Operations scheduling or Job 
scheduling) which you have selected when scheduling the production order, you 
can enter the actual working time consumption either at route level or at job level 
(button VIEW/ Journals/Route card or VIEW/Journals/Job card in the action pane of the 
order). In route card journals and job card journals, there is no proposal initializing 
the lines with default values when manually entering a journal. Click the button 
New in the action pane of the route card (or job card) journal and select the journal 
name in the Create production journal dialog. After clicking OK in the dialog, enter 
one or more lines with date, operation/job number, resource, hours, and good 
quantity in the lines view of the journal detail form before clicking the button Post. 
 
Figure 5-4: 
Picking list journal page with a journal which is not yet posted 
If you do not want to post a journal immediately, you can close the journal lines 
and access the lines view of the journal detail form later again by clicking the 
journal ID shown as link in the grid of the journal page. 
In order to receive the manufactured item in inventory, click the button 
PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Report as finished in the production order. If you 
want to ignore missing consumption postings, select the checkbox Accept error on 
the tab General of the update dialog. Once all transactions of the production order 
are posted, close the order by clicking the button PRODUCTION ORDER/ 
Process/End.

5.2 
Product Management and Bill of Materials 
All material components required for manufacturing have to be entered in the 
shared and the released product records. Apart from inventoried items like 
finished products, semi-finished products, and raw material or parts, product 
records are also necessary for phantom items or purchased services. 
The bill of materials (BOM) specifies the materials which are included in a finished 
product. You can assign one bill of materials or multiple bills of materials to one 
item, but you can also assign one common bill of materials to multiple items. 
Multiple bills of materials for one item are required, if the applicable bill of 
materials is for example depending on the lot size or on the production date. 
In case a product has got variants, select the product subtype “Product master” 
when creating the shared product (see section 7.2.1). Depending on the 
requirements, you can use product configuration models or configuration groups 
in Dynamics AX for products which are configured to customer request. 
5.2.1 
Product Data in Manufacturing 
The shared product form (Product information management> Products> All products 
and product masters) and the released product form (Product information 
management> Products> Released products) contain all finished products, semi-
finished products, and raw materials or parts. At released product level, you can 
also use the Released product maintenance workspace to access the product 
management. 
Details on general product data are included in section 7.2 of this book. The lines 
below therefore only cover product data referring to production control. Except for 
the product type, which is specified in the shared product, these data are included 
in the released product. 
Product change cases (see section 10.5.2) support data maintenance providing the 
option to collect all products affected by a change. You can then validate, approve, 
and activate all related bill of materials and route versions in common. 
5.2.1.1 Item Model Group, Production Type and Default Order Type 
The first essential setting in the released product is the Item model group shown on 
the tab General of the released product form. All items used in production control – 
including finished products, semi-finished products, and raw materials or parts – 
have to be linked to an item model group for stocked products (see section 7.2.1). 
Since this setting is also required for non-inventoried BOM-components like 
subcontractor work, choose the Product type “Service” for non-inventoried 
products in order to avoid inventory control for these items. 
In the lookup field Production type on the tab Engineer, select the option “BOM” for 
finished or semi-finished products. The production types “Formula” and 

5.2  Product Management and Bill of Materials 
189 
“Planning item” provide the option to assign a formula instead of a BOM, which is 
applicable to process manufacturing. 
The production type “None” prevents assigning a BOM to the item. This means 
you can only purchase the item, not produce it. But you can also purchase an item 
with another production type, because the default order type – and not the 
production type – determines the primary sourcing strategy for the item. 
Controlling item sourcing, the default order type is an important setting. The 
lookup field Default order type shows on tab General in the default order settings, 
which you can access by clicking the button PLAN/Default order settings in the 
action pane of the released product form. Following options are available for the 
default order type: 
 Purchase order – Supply through purchase orders 
 Production – Supply through production orders 
 Kanban – Supply through Kanbans (lean manufacturing) 
If you need to override the default order type at the level of a specific site, 
warehouse, or other inventory dimension, open the item coverage form (button 
PLAN/Item coverage in the action pane of the released product). On the tab General 
there, the lookup field Planned order type provides the option to override the default 
order type. 
5.2.1.2 Settings for Quantity and Price 
Apart from the default order type, the tab Inventory in the default order settings 
contains additional default data for production orders including lot size (field 
Multiple) and order quantity. Site-specific order settings, which you can access by 
clicking the button PLAN/Site specific order settings in the action pane of the released 
product, possibly override the default order settings at site level. 
On the tab Manage costs in the released product form, the field Price specifies the 
general cost price of the item. Site-specific cost prices are available in the item price 
form, which you can by clicking the button MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in 
the action pane of the released product (see section 7.3.3). 
If the item model group of the released product applies the valuation model 
“Standard cost”, you have to activate a cost price with a costing version referring 
to the costing type “Standard cost” in the item price form. 
5.2.1.3 Phantom Item 
The slider Phantom on the tab Engineer in the released product form determines the 
default for the Line type when inserting the item as a component in a BOM line. 
Phantom items are semi-finished products with a bill of materials and (optionally) 
a route. When estimating a production order, BOM lines of the type “Phantom” are 
exploded. As a result, the production order contains BOM lines with the 
components of the phantom item (instead of a line with the phantom item itself). 

190 
5  Production Control 
5.2.1.4 Flushing Principle 
The Flushing principle on the tab Engineer of the released product form controls, if 
production orders should post automatic consumption of the particular item in 
BOM lines. It contains three different options: 
 Start – Automatic consumption when starting the production order 
 Finish – Automatic consumption when reporting as finished 
 Manual – No automatic consumption 
In the BOM line, you can override the flushing principle specified in the released 
product record if necessary. 
As a prerequisite for automatic consumption based upon the released product or 
BOM line setting, you have to select the option “Flushing principle” in the lookup 
Automatic BOM consumption on the tab General of the update dialog when starting a 
production order or reporting as finished (see section 5.4.3). 
5.2.2 
Bill of Materials (BOM) 
A bill of materials (BOM) primarily is a list of products with the related quantity. 
The main purpose of a bill of materials is to determine the components of a 
manufactured product (finished or semi-finished product). 
5.2.2.1 Bill of Materials Structure 
In Dynamics AX, components of a manufactured product are not directly assigned 
to the product, but to a bill of materials. This bill of materials is then separately 
assigned to the finished product (compare Figure 5-5). The assignment of the bill of 
materials to the finished product is called “BOM version” in Dynamics AX. One 
finished product can be assigned to one or multiple bills of materials. 
 
Figure 5-5: 
Example of a multi-level product structure with BOMs and BOM versions 

5.2  Product Management and Bill of Materials 
191 
Items, which are included as a component in a BOM, can consist of other items and 
therefore refer to a lower-level BOM. Such items are semi-finished goods, 
generating a multi-level product structure. 
The BOM level (field Level on the tab Engineer of the released product) shows the 
number of product levels between the selected product and a finished product. 
Products, which are not a component in any active BOM show the level “0”. Semi-
finished products, which only are included in BOMs of finished products, show 
the level “1”, and so on. If a product is included as component in the BOMs of 
multiple finished products, the field Level in the released product shows the 
deepest level (highest level number) in any applicable BOM structure. 
The BOM level is important for master planning (calculate the demand of finished 
products first, because this determines the demand of components) and for 
periodic cost calculation (calculate component prices first to use already updated 
prices for upper levels). You can update the BOM level in the form Product 
information management> Periodic tasks> Recalculate BOM level or in parallel to other 
periodic tasks. 
In order to make use of a bill of materials in production control, the BOM and the 
BOM version has to be approved. In addition, the BOM version has to be activated 
if it should apply as a default in production orders and in master planning. An 
active BOM version has to be unique per date, quantity, and site. 
5.2.2.2 Creating Bills of Materials and BOM Versions 
You can access bills of materials from following places: 
 From the released product (Product information management> Products> Released 
products, button ENGINEER/BOM/BOM versions) 
 From the menu (Product information management> Bills of materials and formulas> 
Bills of materials) 
The Product readiness for discrete manufacturing workspace is another place, from 
which you can access (link Bills of materials in the pane on the very right) and create 
(button NEW/BOM in the action pane) bills of materials. The functionality in the 
BOM page then is similar as if accessed from the menu. 
Although the BOM form accessed from the menu and the BOM versions form 
accessed from the released product are used to update the same BOM and BOM 
version records, the functionality and structure of these forms is different. 
Since understanding the data structure is easier if starting from the menu, we start 
with discussing the BOM form accessed this way. Dynamics AX in this case shows 
a list page containing all bills of materials. Clicking a BOM ID shown as link in the 
grid of the list page opens the related detail form in the lines view, where you can 
see the BOM lines. Clicking the button Header below the action pane in the detail 
form switches to the header view, where you can view the BOM versions 
(assignment of finished products to the BOM). 

192 
5  Production Control 
 
Figure 5-6: 
BOM version in the header view of the BOM form (accessed from the menu) 
In order to create a new bill of materials, click the button New in the action pane of 
the BOM form. The BOM detail form then opens in lines view, where you want to 
enter the Name of the BOM (e.g. using the product name) on the tab Bill of materials 
header. Depending on the settings of the applicable number sequence, the BOM ID 
is assigned automatically or has to be entered manually. If the bill of materials is 
site-specific, enter the site in the field Site. Leaving the site empty creates a 
common bill of materials for all sites. 
In order to assign a finished (or semi-finished) product to the BOM, switch to the 
header view and click the button Add in the toolbar of the BOM versions tab (see 
Figure 5-6). In the BOM version line, enter the Item number of the finished product. 
If the BOM is only valid for a particular period, enter the From date and the To date. 
If the BOM assignment depends on the lot size, enter a From qty. And if the BOM 
assignment depends on the site, enter the Site in the assignment line. 
If you want to assign the BOM to a second finished product (which is not very 
common), enter a second BOM version. 
5.2.2.3 BOM Lines 
In the lines view of the BOM form, you can view and edit the components (raw 
materials, parts, and semi-finished products) assigned to the bill of materials. 
When inserting a new BOM line by clicking the button New in the toolbar of the tab 
Bill of materials lines, enter at least the Item number and the Quantity. The column Per 
series specifies the quantity of finished items produced with the component 
quantity in the column Quantity – e.g. 5 boxes (Quantity and Unit) to produce 10 
finished products (Per series). 
If you select the option “Constant” instead of the default “Variable” in the lookup 
field Consumption is (on the sub-tab Setup of the Line details tab), the consumption is 

5.2  Product Management and Bill of Materials 
193 
always the same as entered in the field Quantity, regardless of the finished good 
quantity. If you want to specify additional consumption to cover inevitable scrap, 
enter a percentage in the Variable scrap and/or a fixed quantity in the Constant scrap. 
On the sub-tab Setup in the Line details tab, you can also select a Flushing principle 
for automatic consumption. If the flushing principle in the BOM line is empty, the 
setting in the released product record of the BOM line item applies. 
In a site-specific bill of materials, you can enter a picking warehouse in the column 
Warehouse of the BOM lines. In bills of materials not referring to a particular site, it 
is not possible to specify the picking warehouse in the BOM lines. In both cases, 
you can select the checkbox Resource consumption if you want to apply the 
applicable input warehouse of the resource/resource group as picking warehouse. 
The Line type on the sub-tab General of the Line details tab determines the supply 
strategy of a BOM line with following options: 
 Item – Semi-finished or purchased item, considered as demand in inventory 
 Phantom – Virtual semi-finished item, replaced by its components when 
estimating a production order 
 Pegged supply – Semi-finished or purchased item, creating a referenced sub-
production or purchase order when estimating the production order 
 Vendor – For subcontracting, works like “Pegged supply” 
BOM lines of the line type “Item” generate a demand in inventory. When creating 
planned production or purchase orders, master planning pools different demands 
(orders and warehouse replenishment proposals) according to the item coverage 
settings. The default order type (or the order type in the item coverage) controls, if 
master planning creates a planned purchase order, production order, or Kanban. 
There is no fixed link between the order for the semi-finished item and the original 
production order of the finished product. 
Production order scheduling and master planning calculate the item demand in a 
way that all components have to be available at the start date of the production 
order. If this does not apply to some components because they are required at a 
later date, assign components to the respective route operation by entering the 
operation number in the BOM line. Available operation numbers are depending on 
the route assigned to the finished item. For this reason, the field Oper.No. only got a 
lookup functionality if accessing the BOM lines from the released product. 
Instead of entering all lines in a BOM from scratch, you can copy an existing BOM 
which is similar to the new BOM by clicking the button BILL OF MATERIALS/ 
Maintain/Copy in the action pane of the BOM form. 
5.2.2.4 Approving and Activating 
You can only use approved BOM versions in a production order. Once you have 
finished entering the bill of materials, you can click the button BILL OF 
MATERIALS/Maintain/Approval in the action pane of the BOM form to approve the 

194 
5  Production Control 
bill of materials. Clicking the button Approve in the toolbar of the tab BOM versions 
in the header view of the detail form approves the BOM version (which is the 
assignment of the BOM to the finished product). 
If approving the BOM version before approving the BOM itself, a slider to approve 
BOM and BOM version in parallel is displayed in the Approve version dialog. 
If you want to apply a bill of materials as default in production orders and in 
master planning, activate the BOM version by clicking the button Activate in the 
toolbar of the tab BOM versions. Active BOM versions show a checkmark in the 
column Active and have to be unique per date, quantity, and site. 
In order to support approval and activation, the Product readiness for discrete 
manufacturing workspace contains the list Missing active BOM versions showing 
items with the default order type “Production” but no active BOM version. 
In addition, product change cases support approval processes by providing the 
option to approve and activate multiple bills of materials in a case (see section 
10.5.2). 
You can remove the activation and remove the approval by clicking the button for 
approval or activation again. In order to remove an approval, set the slider Remove 
approval in the dialog to “Yes”. 
5.2.2.5 Bills of Materials in the Released Product 
Apart from the menu item, the released product form provides another way to 
access bills of materials. Clicking the button ENGINEER/BOM/BOM versions in of a 
released product with the Production type “BOM” opens the BOM version form 
where you can view the bills of materials assigned to the selected item. 
 
Figure 5-7: 
Working in the BOM version form (accessed from the released product) 
In the rare case that a bill of materials is assigned to multiple items, you have to 
keep in mind that modifying a bill of materials in this form in parallel applies to all 
other items with a BOM version linked to this BOM. 

5.2  Product Management and Bill of Materials 
195 
The BOM version form (see Figure 5-7) has got a different structure than the BOM 
form accessed from the menu: Instead of a header view and a lines view, it has got 
a tab BOM version (containing the fields of the BOM version) and a tab Bill of 
materials lines (containing the BOM lines of the BOM selected in the BOM version). 
If you want to enter a new bill of materials in this form, click the button New/BOM 
and BOM version in the action pane. Click the button New/BOM version for inserting 
a BOM version only if you want to assign the item to an existing bill of materials. 
After entering BOM version details like site, from/to date, and quantity as 
applicable, you can switch to the tab Bill of materials lines where you can insert 
BOM lines. In order to enter line details, click the button Edit in the toolbar of the 
BOM lines which opens a dialog containing most fields shown of the Line details 
tab in the BOM form accessed from the menu. 
If you want to approve a BOM version in the BOM version form, click the button 
BOM VERSION/Maintain BOM version/Approve in the action pane. 
5.2.2.6 BOM Designer 
The BOM designer is an alternative option for viewing and editing BOMs and 
BOM versions. You can access it by clicking the button ENGINEER/BOM/Designer 
in the action pane of the released product form, or by clicking the button BILL OF 
MATERIALS/MAINTAIN/Designer in the action pane of the BOM form. 
 
Figure 5-8: 
Working in the BOM designer 
The BOM designer shows a multi-level structure of the bill of materials in the left 
pane, and related detail date on tabs in the right pane. In the action pane of this 
form, there are buttons to edit, insert, and delete BOM lines and to create new bills 
of materials with the related version. On the tab Route operations, you can assign a 
BOM line to a route operation by selecting the checkbox Component needed at 
(which is a different way of entering the Oper.No. in a BOM line). 

196 
5  Production Control 
If you want to change the display settings in the BOM designer, click the button 
Setup in the action pane to access a dialog where you can choose which fields to 
view in the left pane (e.g. the quantity). 
Clicking the button Filter in the action pane opens another dialog where you can 
choose which BOM/BOM version to show. The Display principle “Selected/Active” 
(or “Selected”) in the Filter dialog provides the option to view a BOM version, 
which is different from the active BOM version for the selected site, date, and 
quantity. If you select the display principle “Selected”, click the button BOM/BOM 
versions in the BOM designer to access the BOM versions form. In the BOM versions 
form, highlight the BOM version which you want to view and click the button 
Select before closing the form. 
5.2.2.7 Block BOM for Editing 
Depending on the setup, you can update an approved bill of materials at any time. 
In some industries, it is required to protect an approved BOM against any changes. 
For this purpose, there are following settings in the inventory management 
parameters (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory and warehouse management 
parameters, tab Bill of materials): 
 Block editing – If this slider is set to “Yes”, no changes are possible once a BOM 
is approved (remove approval and re-approve afterwards in this case) 
 Block removal of approval – If set to “Yes” in parallel to Block editing, you can’t 
change a BOM once it is approved 
5.2.2.8 Where-Used 
The bill of materials shows the components of an item. If you want to know for a 
component, in which finished or semi-finished products it is included, open the 
where-used form. 
You can access the where-used form, which shows the respective bills of materials 
and related finished products, by clicking the button ENGINEER/BOM/Where-used 
in the action pane of the released product form after selecting the component item. 
5.2.2.9 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The bill of materials form has been redesigned in the new release (now showing a 
list page, header view, and lines view). In the BOM designer, drag and drop 
features are not available because of the browser-based user interface. 
5.2.3 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 5.1 – Components 
Your company wants to produce a new finished item, which consists of two 
components. Enter these components in Dynamics AX, creating an item with the 
product number I-##-C1 and the name “##-Component 1” (## = your user ID) and 
an item with the number I-##-C2 and the name “##-Component 2” in the released 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
197 
product form. Variants and serial/batch numbers are not required. Inventory 
control is at the level of site and warehouse.  
For both items, choose applicable settings for product type, product subtype, 
dimension groups, item group (raw material/parts), and production type. The item 
model group should refer to the inventory model “FIFO”. The unit of measure is 
“Pieces”, and the items are subject to the standard tax rate. Approved vendors are 
not required. 
The base purchase price and the base cost price of both items is USD 100. In 
addition, choose your vendor of exercise 3.2 as main vendor for the items. The 
flushing principle should be “Manual”. For purchasing and inventory, enter the 
main site in the Default order settings and the main warehouse of the main site in 
the Site specific order settings. 
Note: If the number sequence for product numbers is set up for automatic 
numbering, don’t enter a product number. 
Exercise 5.2 – Finished Item 
For the finished product, create an item with the product number I-##-F (if no 
automatic number sequence applies) and the name “##-Finished product” in the 
released product form. Variants and serial/batch numbers are not required. 
Inventory control is per site and warehouse. 
Choose applicable settings for product type, product subtype, dimension groups, 
item group (finished product), and production type. The item model group should 
refer to the inventory model “FIFO”. The unit of measure is “Pieces”, and the item 
is subject to the standard tax rate. 
The base cost price is USD 500 and the base sales price USD 1,000. In the Default 
order settings, make sure that the appropriate Default order type is selected and enter 
the main site in the settings for inventory and sales. Finally enter the main 
warehouse as default for inventory and sales in the Site specific order settings. 
Exercise 5.3 – Bill of Materials 
After creating item records for the finished item and its components in the 
exercises above, enter a bill of materials for the finished item of exercise 5.2 starting 
in the released product form. 
The BOM applies to the main site and contains two units of the first and one unit of 
the second item entered in exercise 5.1. The warehouse for picking the components 
should be the main warehouse. Once you have finished entering the components, 
approve and activate the BOM version. 
5.3 
Resource and Route Management 
Resources are the basic entities in a company, which execute the operations in 
manufacturing. They include working places, personnel, machines, tools, and 

198 
5  Production Control 
vendors (subcontractors). Resources provide the available capacity which 
scheduling and master planning matches with the capacity demand. 
Routes are the basis for calculating the capacity demand, specifying the necessary 
resources and the working time for producing a particular item. 
Along with items and bills of materials, resources and routes therefore are the 
second area of master data required for production control. 
5.3.1 
Production Unit and Resource Group 
Production units represent plants in capacity management. Within a production 
unit, resource groups collect resources according to the physical organization in 
the shop floor. Resources within a resource group can have different capabilities 
and do not need to be interchangeable. 
5.3.1.1 Production Units 
Production units, which refer to capacity management, are controlled separately 
from the storage dimension “Site”, which refers to material management. They are 
not included in inventory transactions, but they are available for filtering/sorting in 
applicable production control forms (e.g. Production control> Operations> Current 
operations). Multiple production units can be linked to one common site. 
Setting up production units is optional. If you want to create a production unit, 
access the form Production control> Setup> Production> Production units and enter 
identification, name, and site of the new production unit. On the tab General, you 
can optionally enter an Input warehouse. This warehouse applies as picking 
warehouse to BOM lines with a checkmark in the checkbox Resource consumption. 
Resource groups are linked to a production unit by selecting the production unit in 
the respective field of the resource groups form. 
5.3.1.2 Resource Groups and Resource Assignment 
Resource groups in Dynamics AX reflect the physical organization of resources 
with following purpose: 
 Structuring – Establishing a hierarchical organization structure by linking 
resources, resource groups, production units, sites, and warehouses 
 Scheduling – Capacity planning at resource group level in operations 
scheduling 
Assigning resources to resource groups is date effective, providing the option to 
adjust the assignment according to organizational and seasonal changes. A 
resource cannot be linked to more than one resource group at any date. 
If a resource is not attached to a resource group a given day, it is not available for 
production on that day. Resource scheduling only includes resources which are 
assigned to a resource group. 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
199 
If you want to edit resource groups, open the form Production control> Setup> 
Resources> Resource groups. In order to create a new resource group, click the button 
New in the action pane and enter the applicable identification, name and site. 
On the tab General of the resource groups form, optionally assign a production 
unit. The Input warehouse specifies the warehouse for consuming BOM lines, which 
show a checkmark in the checkbox Resource consumption (overriding the default of 
an applicable production unit). 
Settings on the tab Operation correspond to equivalent settings on resources in the 
resource form (see section 5.3.2 below). 
The tab Resources shows the resources which are a member of the selected resource 
group. In order to assign an additional resource, click the button Add in the toolbar 
of this tab. The button View/All in the toolbar provides the option to view past 
assignments. Apart from attaching resources to a resource group in the resource 
group form, you can start in the resource form and select the resource group of a 
resource there. 
 
Figure 5-9: 
Editing a resource group 
By setting the slider Work cell on the tab General in the resource group to “Yes”, the 
resource group refers to lean manufacturing and is not available for operations and 
production orders in discrete manufacturing. In addition, the tab Work cell capacity 
specifying capacity for lean manufacturing is editable in this case. 
5.3.1.3 Working Time Calendar and Templates 
The working time calendar assigned to a resource determines the hours of 
operation. For a resource, capacity calculation includes the working time calendar 
and the efficiency percentage. For a resource group, the available capacity is the 
total capacity of its resources 

200 
5  Production Control 
If you want to attach a calendar to a resource group, expand the tab Calendars of 
the resource groups form. Calendar assignment is date effective, providing the 
option to record a future change of the calendar (button View/All in the toolbar to 
show the Effective date) – for example changing the working time of a particular 
resource group from regular business hours to a 24-hour operation. 
Before you can assign a calendar to a resource group, the calendar has to be set up 
in the form Production control> Setup> Calendars> Calendars. If you need to enter a 
new calendar (for example if a resource group has working times which are 
different from all existing calendars), insert a new record in the calendar form. In 
order to assign working days and working hours, click the button Working times in 
the calendar form. The working times form shows calendar days in the upper pane 
and the hours (which you can update) of the selected day in the lower pane. 
You can create working days and related hours by clicking the button Compose 
working times in the working times form. In the Compose working times dialog, select 
a Working time template providing the default for the daily working times. 
Working time templates are available in the form Production control> Setup> 
Calendars> Working time templates, where you specify the weekly working hours on 
the tabs Monday to Sunday after selecting a particular template. 
 
Figure 5-10: Editing working times in the working times form 
The base calendar is an alternative to the working time template for determining 
working times. In the calendar form, you can select a related Base calendar per 
calendar. If you set the slider Use base calendar in the Compose working time dialog to 
“Yes” then, the column Control in the working days of the working times form is 
initialized with the option “Base calendar”. This option means that the working 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
201 
time is given by the base calendar. Changing the Control to “Open” or “Closed” 
overrides the working times in the current calendar for the selected day. 
Independently from the base calendar functionality, you can override the working 
times of a particular resource or resource group by clicking the button RESOURCE/ 
Maintain/Calendar deviations in the resource or resource group form and assigning 
an alternative calendar on a given date (e.g. a calendar without working times if a 
resource is temporarily not available). 
5.3.2 
Resource and Capability 
Resources are the lowest level for capacity management in Dynamics AX. They are 
assigned to resource groups according to the organizational hierarchy, and 
(optionally) to resource capabilities according to the functional abilities. 
5.3.2.1 Creating and Editing Resources 
In order to edit resources, open the form Production control> Setup> Resources> 
Resources. If you want to insert a new resource, be aware that the resource 
identification needs to be unique – not only within the resources, but also within 
resource groups. You can easily distinguish resources from resource groups for 
example by using a longer identification number for resources. 
When creating a resource, you have to select a resource type in the lookup field 
Type in order to distinguish between the different kinds of resources: 
 Machine – General default, for production machines 
 Human resources – Personnel (optionally link a worker record) 
 Vendor – External resource for subcontracting (optionally link a vendor record) 
 Tool – Device, often subject to wear through usage 
 Location – Represents physical space (independent from warehouse locations) 
 Facility – Similar to “Machine”, but for a group of machines and people 
If you do not need to schedule and to report the activities of a machine and its 
operating staff separately, you can manage them in a common resource of the type 
“Facility” or “Machine”. If you want to manage tools, enter the tool usage as a 
secondary operation in routes (see section 5.3.3 below). 
On the tab Calendars of the resources form you can assign a calendar to a resource 
(similar to assigning a calendar to a resource group). 
The Resource groups tab provides the option to view and to update the resource 
group assignment. In order to change the group assignment, click the button Add 
in the toolbar of this tab or the button RESOURCE/Maintain/Add to resource group in 
the action pane of the form. 
5.3.2.2 Operation Settings on the Resource 
The unit of time for scheduling a resource is hours. If you need a different unit of 
time for a resource, enter a conversion factor in the field Hours/time on the tab 

202 
5  Production Control 
Operation of the resource form. If the time in route operations is in minutes for 
example, enter 1/60 = 0.0167 in the Hours/time. 
If a particular resource does not apply a unit of time for the unit of measure, you 
can select an alternative Capacity unit on the tab Operation. The field Capacity then 
contains the conversion factor to hours. In related route operations, select the 
option “Capacity” in the field Formula on the tab Setup then. 
 
Figure 5-11: Managing capacity settings of a resource 
The Efficiency percentage in the field group Scheduling provides the option to reduce 
or increase the scheduled time of a route. The default for the efficiency percentage 
is 100. If creating a resource, which is 25 percent faster than a standard resource for 
example, enter 125 in the efficiency percentage. Scheduling of an operation usually 
lasting 10 hours gives a scheduled time of 8 hours (= 10 * 100/125) on this resource. 
The slider Finite capacity controls for the selected resource, whether capacity 
reservations from other production orders reduce the available capacity when 
scheduling an order. If the slider is set to “Yes”, only one operation at a time is 
scheduled on this resource. Otherwise, scheduling calculates every production 
order separately regardless of other orders on the same resource. In most cases, 
finite capacity only applies to particular resources and resource groups which 
don’t have the possibility to increase the capacity (e.g. by overtime hours). 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
203 
In the master plan (for master planning) and in the update dialogs when 
scheduling a production order (for operations scheduling and job scheduling), you 
can choose to disregard the finite capacity setting of the resource. 
The cost categories Setup category and Run time category determine the hourly rate 
of the resource, the Quantity category can specify a quantity-depending price. The 
other field groups on the tab Operation in the resource form contain fields 
providing a default value for route operations. These defaults apply when 
selecting the resource or resource group as costing resource in a route operation. 
5.3.2.3 Resource Capabilities 
Resource capabilities determine the kind of activities which a resource is able to do 
– for example welding or cutting. You can temporarily or permanently assign one 
or more capabilities to a resource. This capability assignment is only available on 
resources, not on resource groups. If you want to use capabilities in routes, assign 
resources to operations by specifying required capabilities in the resource 
requirements (see section 5.3.3 below). 
In order to set up capabilities (shared across companies), open the form Production 
control> Setup> Resources> Resource capabilities and enter the identification and 
description of the capability. On the tab Resources of the capabilities form, assign 
resources to the particular capability. 
 
Figure 5-12: Managing the resource capability assignment in the capabilities form 
As an alternative to the capability form, you can also assign capabilities to 
resources in the resource form. In the resource from you can select the capabilities 
of each resource by clicking the button Add in the toolbar on the tab Capabilities or 
the button RESOURCE/Maintain/Add capability in the action pane of the form. 
Capability assignment is date effective, providing the option to record future 
changes of resource abilities. In addition, there is a Priority field in the assignment 
line. Depending on the scheduling parameters, Dynamics AX searches for the 

204 
5  Production Control 
applicable resource with the highest priority (i.e. the lowest priority number – 
priority “1” is selected first) when executing job scheduling. 
5.3.2.4 Settings for Ledger Integration 
The tab Ledger postings in the resource form contains the main accounts which 
apply to route consumption. When posting a route card or job card journal in 
production, Dynamics AX in parallel posts the costs of the resource consumption 
(usually measured by the working time) to the main accounts specified in the field 
group Accounts-Physical of the resource form. When costing and ending a 
production order, ledger transactions are posted to the accounts in the field group 
Accounts-Financial. 
The ledger settings in the resource only apply, if the option “Item and resource” is 
selected in the lookup field Ledger posting of the production order (see section 
9.4.3). If the option “Item and category” is selected, applicable main accounts are 
derived from the cost categories. 
5.3.2.5 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in resource management include minor changes like the new 
resource type “Facility” and a separate tab for the calendar assignment in the 
resource form. 
5.3.3 
Route and Operation 
Routes determine the operations for producing an item. In addition to the bills of 
materials, which contain the required material, they are the second part of the 
required setup for production. 
Like bills of materials, routes contain planned data which provide a target for 
production. In the course of manufacturing, your workshop reports actual figures 
in production journal transactions. Comparing and analyzing target and actual 
figures is a basis for possible improvements. 
In order to sufficiently describe the operations in manufacturing, a route has to 
contain at least following data: 
 Activity – Specified in the field Operation 
 Resource – Specified on the tab Resource requirements 
 Sequence of operations – Specified by entering the next operation (field Next) 
 Time consumption – Specified in the fields Setup time and Run time 
 Produced item – Specified in the Item number of the route version 
 Required material – Specified in the BOM of the produced item 
If the workshop does not need all components of the bill of materials when starting 
the first operation, you can link BOM lines to the applicable route operation as 
shown in section 5.2.2. 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
205 
5.3.3.1 Setup of Operations 
Operations (Production control> Setup> Routes> Operations) are a prerequisite for 
setting up routes in Dynamics AX. After creating an operation, you can select it in 
as many routes as required. 
An operation itself is independent from routes, containing only a unique 
identification and a name. Other details which are necessary to execute an 
operation – e.g. the provided time or the required resource – are not available in 
the operation record, but in the operation relations. 
 
Figure 5-13: Managing general operation relations for an operation 
In order to view and to edit operation details (operation relations), click the button 
Relations in the operations form. Depending on the requirements, enter operation 
relations at a general level or specific to a route: 
 General – For operation details at a general level, select the option “All” in the 
field Item code and Route code of the operation relation (see Figure 5-13). 
 Route-specific – Route-specific operation details contain the option “Route” in 
the Route code and the route number in the field Route relation. 
After switching to the other tabs of the operation relations form, you can enter 
details of the particular operation relation including applicable resources and 
times. More information on this subject is available in the description of route 
operations further below in this section. 
5.3.3.2 Operation Sequence 
The sequence of operations is not specified in the operation record, but in the 
route. There are two types of operation sequences: 
 Simple sequence – One operation after the other 
 Complex sequence – Multiple predecessor for an operation possible 

206 
5  Production Control 
If the slider Route network on the tab General of the production control parameters is 
set to “No”, simple operation sequences apply. Routes in this case only contain 
operations executed one after the other. 
 
Figure 5-14: Example of a simple operation sequence 
If the checkbox Route network is set to “Yes”, you have to enter the next operation 
in each operation of a route. This setting enables complex operation sequences, 
where you can connect operations to multiple independent prior operations. 
 
Figure 5-15: Example of a complex operation sequence 
Regardless of simple or complex operation sequences, you can specify to perform 
operations on multiple resources in parallel by entering a secondary operation in 
routes (selecting the Priority “Secondary” for the particular route operation). 
If the available options in the route do not meet your specific requirements, you 
can set up an intermediate level of a virtual semi-finished item in the structure of 
the finished product. The line type of the BOM line, which contains the virtual 
item, should be “Pegged supply” for connecting the production order for the 
virtual semi-finished item directly to the production order of the finished item.  
5.3.3.3 Creating Routes and Route Versions 
Managing routes in Dynamics AX is similar to managing bills of materials, 
including the way to access the route form: 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
207 
 From the released product (Product information management> Products> Released 
products, button ENGINEER/View/Route) 
 From the menu (Production control> All routes) 
The Product readiness for discrete manufacturing workspace is another place, from 
which you can access (link All routes in the pane on the very right) and create 
(button NEW/ Route in the action pane) routes. The functionality in the route page 
then is similar as if accessed from the menu. 
Although the route form accessed from the menu and the route version form 
accessed from the released product are used to update the same route and route 
version records, the functionality and structure of these forms is different. 
Like the assignment of bills of materials, the assignment of routes to finished items 
is called “Version”, optionally specifying validity dates and a from-quantity. 
Unlike bills of materials, a route version always refers to a site. 
If accessing the routes from the menu, Dynamics AX displays all routes in a list 
page. Clicking a route number shown as link in the grid of the list page opens the 
route form. This form shows the route header on the tab General and one or more 
assigned finished items (“Versions”) on the tab Versions. 
In order to create a new route, click the button New in the action pane of the route 
form or the list page. The route number derives from the appropriate number 
sequence or has to be entered manually. After entering a Name for the new route 
on the tab General of the route form, you can assign one or more finished items 
together with the applicable site on the tab Versions. 
5.3.3.4 Route Operations 
In order to access the route operations from the route form (or from the list page), 
click the button ROUTE/Maintain/Route details in the action pane. 
The route operation details form then shows the route operations in the upper 
pane. In the lower pane of the route operation details form, you can view the 
operation relations (operation details) of the operation selected in the upper pane. 
In order to insert a new operation, click the button New in the action pane. You can 
override the operation number in the column Oper.No. (if required) and enter the 
applicable operation in the column Operation next. If the production control 
parameters specify complex operation sequences , you have to enter the number of 
the next route operation (except for the last operation) in the column Next of the 
upper pane. 
If the shop floor should execute operations in parallel, enter two operations with 
the same operation number, but a different Priority. In the example of Figure 5-16, 
the operation number 30 shows two parallel operations – one with priority 
“Primary” and the other with priority “Secondary 1”. 

208 
5  Production Control 
If you want to specify additional time and material consumption to cover 
inevitable scrap caused by the operation, enter a Scrap percentage. Scrap in different 
route operations is multiplied. If you have a route containing two operations each 
with 10 percent scrap for example, the calculation of material and resource demand 
for the first operation shows a requirement of 123 % to receive 111 % output, which 
subsequently is reduced to an output of 100 % by the second operation. 
Operation details (operation relations) are available in the lower pane of the form. 
If a general operation relation – indicated by the option “All” in the column Route 
code – is set up for the selected operation, it shows in the lower pane of the route 
form after saving the record in the upper pane. When changing data of a general 
operation relation in the route form, keep in mind that these changes apply to all 
routes referring to the particular general operation relation. 
 
Figure 5-16: Editing a route operation with a general operation relation (All/All) 
If you want to record route-specific operation details, insert a line with a new 
operation relation in the lower pane of the route from. When inserting this 
operation relation, select the option “Route” in the column Route code and enter 
required data on the other tabs of the lower pane. 
5.3.3.5 Route Groups 
An essential setting for posting resource consumption related to an operation is the 
Route group on the tab Overview (and the tab General) in the lower pane of the route 
operation detail form. If you want to apply automatic posting of time consumption 
(actual = estimate), you have to select a route group with appropriate settings for 
automatic route consumption. 
In order to access route group settings, choose the form Production control> Setup> 
Routes> Route groups. In route groups for automatic posting, set the sliders for Setup 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
209 
time, Run time and Quantity in the field group Automatic route consumption to “Yes”. 
In addition, clear the checkboxes in the column Job management on the tab Setup for 
these route groups (automatic consumption is posted through route cards). 
The sliders in the field group Estimation and costing control, whether to include 
assigned operations in estimation and cost calculation. For regular operations, you 
want to set the sliders for time based cost calculation or the slider for quantity 
based cost calculation to “Yes”. If all sliders for costing are set to “No”, 
Dynamics AX will only calculate the time but no costs for assigned operations. 
5.3.3.6 Costing Resource and Cost Categories  
The tab Setup in the lower pane of the route operation detail form contains the 
Costing resource, which specifies the resource used for the cost estimation of 
production orders. When – optionally – selecting a costing resource in an operation 
relation, data from this resource apply as default to the Cost categories and the fields 
on the tab Times. 
Cost categories are a second setting for controlling cost estimation and cost 
calculation apart from the route group. You can assign different cost categories for 
setup time, run time and quantity. When assigning cost categories, make sure the 
appropriate sliders in the route group for including time or quantity in the cost 
calculation are set to “Yes”. 
Before creating a new cost category, you have to enter a related shared category in 
the form Production control> Setup> Routes> Shared categories. Shared categories 
ensure common category definitions across companies. For categories applicable to 
production, set the slider Can be used in Production in the shared category to “Yes”. 
Required cost categories in production control, are available in the form Production 
control> Setup> Routes> Cost categories. These categories contain three core settings: 
 Cost price – Determining the hourly rate (for setup time and run time) 
 Cost group – Classifying cost types in cost calculation (see section 7.3.3) 
 Ledger-Resources – Determining main accounts similar to ledger integration 
settings of resources (see section 5.3.2 above) in case the production order 
shows the option “Item and category” in the lookup field Ledger posting 
In order to specify a cost price for a category, click the button CATEGORY SETUP/ 
Price in the action pane of the cost categories to access the cost category price form. 
In the cost category price form, enter a cost price for the category per site or – if 
leaving the field Site empty – at company level with a costing version (costing 
versions are covered in section 7.3.3). In order to make the price effective, activate 
it by clicking the button Activate. 
Cost estimation uses the cost price of the cost categories assigned to the route 
operation. The cost price for actual costs derives from the resource entered in the 
posted route consumption transaction. 

210 
5  Production Control 
5.3.3.7 Operation Times 
The tab Times of the operations relations contains the provided time for the 
operation, split into setup time, run time, queue times and transit time. The field 
Run time contains the time, in which the workshop should process the quantity of 
the product entered in the field Process qty. 
If the Process qty. is 1.00, the run time is the time in hours to produce one unit. You 
can apply other units of time, entering a conversion factor Hours/time in the route 
operation or selecting a capacity unit in the resource (see section 5.3.2). 
The processing time of an operation calculates according to following formula: 
(
)
resource
the
of
percentage
Efficiency
Quantity
time
Run
time
Setup
TIME
PROCESSING
×
+
=
 
In addition to the processing time, queue and transit times are included in the total 
lead time. 
5.3.3.8 Resource Requirements and Resource Load 
On the tab Resource load of the operation relations, the field Quantity specifies the 
number of required resources (resources working in parallel). The calculation of 
required capacity then multiplies the operation time with the load quantity. 
Applicable resources for the operation are specified on the tab Resource requirements 
(independently from the costing resource). If there are multiple requirement lines, 
applicable resources must meet all requirements.  
By selecting the checkbox in the appropriate column you can specify requirements 
for Operations scheduling independently from requirements for Job scheduling. In the 
column Requirement type, you can select if a requirement is based on a resource 
group, resource, resource type, or capability. The options “Skill”, “Courses”, 
“Certificate” and “Title” apply to job scheduling for resources of the resource type 
“Human resource”, referring to worker data in human resource management. 
The button Applicable resources in the toolbar of the lower pane in the route 
operation detail form provides the option to check which resources meet the 
requirements entered for a route operation. Since the assignment of resources to 
resource groups and capabilities is date effective, you have to choose a date for 
displaying applicable resources. In addition, you have to choose whether you want 
to view applicable resources for operations scheduling or for job scheduling. 
After closing the route operation detail form, you can click the button Route 
feasibility in the toolbar of the tab Versions in the route form to show an overview of 
the resource availability for all operations. 
5.3.3.9 Approving and Activating Routes 
Like bills of materials, routes and route versions have to be approved before they 
are available for production orders. You can approve a route by clicking the button 

5.3  Resource and Route Management 
211 
ROUTE/Maintain/Approve in the action pane of the route list page or the route form. 
In order to approve a route version, click the button Approve in the toolbar of the 
tab Versions in the route form. If approving the route version before approving the 
route, a slider to approve the route in parallel shows in the approval dialog. 
If you want to apply a route as a default in production orders and in master 
planning, activate the route version by clicking the button Activation in the toolbar 
of the tab Versions. Active route versions show a checkmark in the column Active 
and have to be unique per date, quantity, and site. 
Depending on settings in the production control parameters (sliders Block editing 
and Block removal of approval on the tab General, similar to the settings for BOMs), 
you can update an approved route at any time. 
In order to remove the activation or the approval of a route, click the button for 
approval or activation again. 
5.3.3.10 Routes in the Released Product 
As an alternative to the menu item, you can access routes from the released 
product form. Clicking the button ENGINEER/View/Route in the action pane of the 
released product opens the route version form where you can view the routes 
assigned to the selected item. 
The route version form accessed from the released product has got a different 
structure than to the route form accessed from the menu – it shows the route 
versions in the upper pane and the operations with operation number and 
operation relation details in the lower pane. If you want to enter a completely new 
route in this from, click the button New/Route and route version in the action pane. 
Click the button New/Route version for inserting a route version if you want to 
assign the item to an existing route. 
If a general operation relation – indicated by the option “All” in the column Route 
code – exists for an operation, detail data from this relation apply to the route 
operation. Unlike the route form accessed from the menu, overriding data from the 
general operation relation in this form automatically creates a route-specific 
operation relation – indicated by the option “Route” in the column Route code.  
In order to create a route-specific operation relation based on an applicable general 
operation relation, you can alternatively click the button Copy and edit relation in the 
toolbar of the lower pane (same result as simply overriding data). If you want to 
delete a route-specific operation relation and to apply an applicable general 
operation relation again, click the button Delete relation in the toolbar. 
If no general operation relation exists for a route operation, you have to enter a 
new operation relation manually with all required data in the lower pane.

5.3.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 5.4 – Route Setup 
In order to better understand the function of capabilities, route groups, and cost 
categories, you want to set up an example. As a start, create a capability C-## (## = 
your user ID) with the name “##-specific”. Then enter a route group R-## for 
manual posting of working time consumption. Estimation and costing should only 
be based upon setup time and run time. 
Finally, set up a new cost category G-## (together with a shared category applying 
to production). Select an appropriate cost group of your choice in the cost category 
and enter main accounts similar to the settings in existing cost categories. For the 
hourly rate, enter a cost price of USD 100 for a costing version of the costing type 
“Planned cost” and the main site. Then activate the cost price. 
Exercise 5.5 – Resources and Resource Group 
In order to produce the finished product of exercise 5.2, new resources are 
required. Enter a new resource group W-## with the name “##-assembly”, referring 
to the main site and an appropriate production unit. The cost categories for setup 
time and for run time are the ones entered in exercise 5.4. Select a regular calendar 
of your choice as resource group calendar. 
Then create two new resources, W-##-1 and W-##-2, of the type “Machine”. For 
both resources, the route group and – for setup and for run time – the cost category 
of exercise 5.4 applies. Choose main accounts for the resources which are similar to 
the settings in existing resources. Assign both resources to the new resource group 
W-##, but only the resource W-##-2 to the capability entered in exercise 5.4. The 
resources use the same calendar as the resource group. 
Exercise 5.6 – Operation 
In order to produce your product, you need a new operation. Create the operation 
O-## (## = your user ID) with the name “##-processing”. In general, the setup time 
for this operation is one hour and the run time two hours per unit. Select the 
resource W-##-1 of exercise 5.5 as costing resource, applying defaults for route 
group and cost categories. Resources applicable to the operation belong to the 
resource group W-## and show the capability C-## of exercise 5.4. 
Exercise 5.7 – Route 
Manufacturing your product also requires a new route, which you want to enter 
based on the elements in the previous exercises. After selecting your item I-##-F of 
exercise 5.2 in the released product form, open the route form by clicking the 
appropriate button. Create a new route, which contains the operation O-## of 
exercise 5.6 as the only route operation. There is no setup time, and the run time 
for the operation is one hour per unit. The other settings of route operation – 

5.4  Production Order Management 
213 
including costing resource, route group, cost categories and resource requirements 
– are the same as the applicable general operation relation entered in exercise 5.6. 
Once you have entered the route details, approve and activate the route. Can you 
check applicable resources for executing the route operations? Finally, check all 
operation relations referring to the operation of exercise 5.6. 
5.4 
Production Order Management 
A production order is a request to manufacture a particular product. Apart from 
the item number and quantity of the finished or semi-finished item, production 
orders contain data regarding required materials and resources. 
The order status, which is updated with every step in the sequential flow of order 
processing displays, the progress of a production order. 
5.4.1 
Basics of Production Order Processing 
Apart from manually entering a production order, there are following options for 
automatic creation: 
 Master planning – Generating a planned production order which you can firm, 
or an actual production order (see section 6.3.4) 
 Pegged supply – Automatically generating a production order from the BOM 
line of another production order (sub-production, see section 5.4.3) 
 Sales order – Creating a production order by clicking the button Product and 
supply/New/Production order in the toolbar of a sales order line 
If you create a production order manually, the first status is “Created”. The status 
“Created” is the only status which allows deleting a production order. If you need 
to delete a production order in a later status, you have to reset the status first. 
After creating a production order, it runs through the manufacturing cycle 
updating the order status in following steps: 
 Created – Temporary status after creating a new order 
 Estimated – Material and of resource demand is calculated 
 Scheduled – Start and end dates are calculated 
 Released – Order is transferred to the shop floor 
 Started – Posting of actual consumption is possible 
 Reported as finished – Finished item is received in inventory 
 Ended – Order is finally closed 
The order status changes whenever you update the production order by clicking a 
button for processing in the production order form or by executing a periodic 
activity in the folder Periodic tasks of the production control module. Depending on 
settings on the tab Status of the production control parameters, you can skip steps 
in the manufacturing cycle. Dynamics AX automatically executes the omitted steps 
when starting a subsequent step, applying standard parameter settings in this case. 

214 
5  Production Control 
You can also reset the status of an order depending on production control 
parameter settings. For this purpose, click the button PRODUCTION ORDER/ 
Process/Reset status in the action pane of the production order form. When resetting 
the status, keep in mind that Dynamics AX reverses all posted transactions related 
to the reversed status. 
Unlike parameter settings in other areas, production control parameters are not 
only available at company level, but also at site level. The lookup field Parameter 
usage in the production control parameters at company level (Production control> 
Setup> Production control parameters) determines, if site-specific parameters apply to 
your company. Site-specific parameters are available in the form Production control> 
Setup> Production control parameters by site. 
Scheduling parameters, initializing the update dialogs for scheduling production 
orders with default, are available in the form Master planning> Setup> Scheduling> 
Scheduling parameters. Like the production control parameters, they are available at 
company level and per site. Core scheduling parameters include the Primary 
resource selection, specifying if capability-based scheduling is based on the shortest 
duration or on the priority. 
5.4.2 
Production Order Registration 
Creating a production order creates the header data, the production BOM lines, 
and the production route. Dynamics AX at this time creates an inventory 
transaction for the produced item with the status “Ordered” in the column Receipt 
(similar to a purchase order line). 
The inventory transactions for the components of the production order (BOM 
lines) are not created until estimating the order. At this stage, master planning 
recognizes a supply of the produced item from the inventory transactions, but does 
not see the demand for components (inventory transactions are not created yet). 
For this reason, you should estimate a production order soon after creating it. 
When automatically creating a production order from a planned order, settings in 
the applicable coverage group determine the initial status (usually “Scheduled”). 
5.4.2.1 Entering a New Production Order 
Depending on how you want to proceed when manually creating a production 
order, you can start from the Production floor management workspace or from the 
production order form (Production control> Production Orders> All production orders). 
Clicking the button Create new/Production order in the action pane of the workspace 
or the button New production order in the production order opens the Create 
production order dialog, where you have to choose the item number of the finished 
product. Depending on the selected item, several fields are initialized with default 
values which you can override as required (for example selecting a different BOM). 

5.4  Production Order Management 
215 
Clicking the button Create in the create order dialog then generates the production 
order. After creating, the order shows the status “Created” and switches to a 
subsequent status when updating the order. You can view a summary of executed 
status updates on the tab Update of the production order detail form. 
 
Figure 5-17: Creating a production order in the production floor management workspace 
If required, you can change settings in a production order later (for example 
modifying the BOM lines or the route lines in the order). When changing an order 
which is estimated or scheduled already, run the estimation and/or scheduling 
after your changes again to ensure correct production data. If production papers 
have been printed already, you might need to reprint them with updated data. 
Production orders, which have been created automatically, show a reference to 
their origin on the tab References of the production order detail form. If the 
production order refers to another order, this original order displays in the item 
reference type and number. If you have created the production order in a sales 
order line, the item reference type is “Sales order”. In production orders generated 
as sub-production for the BOM line of another production order, the item reference 
type is “Production line”. 
5.4.2.2 Production BOM and Route 
Like all documents, production orders contain a header with data common for the 
whole order – including the order number, the item number of the finished 

216 
5  Production Control 
product, the order quantity, and the delivery date. But unlike sales orders or 
purchase orders, production orders include two different types of lines: 
 BOM lines – Containing the required material 
 Route lines – Containing the required operations 
The production order detail form, which you can access by clicking a production 
order number shown as link in the grid of the production order list page 
(Production control> Production Orders> All Production Orders), only shows the 
production order header. 
In order to access the BOM lines of a particular production order, click the button 
PRODUCTION ORDER/Production details/BOM in the action pane. Clicking an item 
number shown as link in the BOM lines provides access to the BOM line details. 
Clicking the button PRODUCTION ORDER/Production details/Route shows the 
production route with its operations. 
 
Figure 5-18: Deriving BOM and route when creating a production order 
When creating a production order, Dynamics AX copies the active BOM and route 
of the finished item into the production order. If multiple BOMs and routes are 
active for a finished item, the applicable version is determined based on site, date, 
and order quantity. For this purpose, the field BOM date – receiving its default 
from the delivery date – in the Create production order dialog determines the date 
applied for BOM selection. 
If you do not want to apply the active BOM or route in a particular production 
order, you can select another approved BOM or route version – e.g. an alternative 
BOM and route for subcontracting – in the create order dialog.

5.4.2.3 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in production order management refer to the browser-based 
user interface with dashboard and workspaces. 
5.4.3 
Processing Production Orders 
After creating a production order, you want to update the status in order to 
prepare production order processing. 
5.4.3.1 Default Values in Update Dialogs 
When updating the status of a production order, an update dialog displays. In the 
update dialog, you can click the button Default values if you want to specify default 
values which are different from the standard defaults. Clicking the button Make 
default for all users in the default values dialog after entering appropriate settings 
applies the customized default values to all users. 
5.4.3.2 Estimation 
Estimation is the first step after creating a production order. The primary task of 
estimation is to calculate the required material and resources capacity for the 
production order. The basis for this calculation is the bill of materials and the route 
of the order. 
In order to run the estimation, click the button PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/ 
Estimate in the action pane of the production order form. In the estimation dialog, 
the lookup field Profit setting determines the markup for sales price calculation. 
In parallel to calculating required quantities and times, estimation determines 
projected costs based on the cost price of material components and route 
operations. The markup for the calculated sales price is specified in the cost groups 
of the items and route operations. 
You can view the cost estimation by clicking the button MANAGE COSTS/ 
Calculations/View calculation details in the action pane of the production order form. 
The tab Overview estimation of the price calculation form shows the individual 
estimation lines. If you want to view a summary according to the costing sheet 
setup, switch to the tab Costing sheet in the price calculation form. 
For the BOM lines of the production order, estimation creates inventory 
transactions which are similar to the inventory transactions of open sales order 
lines. You can view this transaction by clicking the button Inventory/Transactions in 
the BOM lines form of the production order. 
Since there are no inventory transactions related to BOM lines before estimation, 
this status is the earliest order status for manual or automatic reservation (see 
section 7.4.5). 
For BOM lines with the Line type is “Pegged supply”, estimation creates an order: 

218 
5  Production Control 
 Sub-production order – Related sub-production order (regular production 
order linked to the main production order) for BOM lines with an item with the 
default order type “Production” 
 Purchase order – Related purchase order for BOM lines with an item with the 
default order type “Purchase order” 
For BOM lines with the line type “Phantom”, estimation replaces the BOM line by 
the components of the phantom item (BOM and route). 
5.4.3.3 Scheduling 
Scheduling of a production order is necessary to calculate the exact dates/times of 
the material and resource demand and to reserve capacity on the applicable 
resource group or resource. In Dynamics AX, there are two types of scheduling: 
 Operations scheduling – Resource group and day level 
 Job scheduling – Resource and start/end time level 
Depending on the setup and the requirements, you can execute either operations 
scheduling, or job scheduling, or both (first operations scheduling, then job 
scheduling). 
Operations scheduling is a rough scheduling process, which calculates the 
required time per day. It reserves capacity on the resource group selected on the 
basis of the resource requirements in the route operation (capabilities, resource 
groups, resource types). If resource requirements for operations scheduling 
directly refer to a resource number, capacity reservation is on the particular 
resource instead of the group. 
The operations scheduling calculation simultaneously includes the capacity of the 
resource group, the capacity per resource type, and the capacity per capability. The 
available capacity of a resource group is the total capacity of its resources. 
Job scheduling at a later stage of production order processing calculates the 
capacity at resource level, reserving capacity with exact start and end times. 
Depending on scheduling parameters, the selected resource is the available 
resource with the shortest duration (throughput time) or with the highest priority 
(lowest priority number). 
In addition to calculating exact start and end times, job scheduling generates jobs 
which split the route operations of a production order to individual tasks. These 
individual tasks show different job types, corresponding to the different time fields 
on the tab Times of the route operation (e.g. Setup time and Run time). Available job 
types for a particular operation are determined by the Route group of the operation 
(settings on the tab Setup in the route group form). 
Job transactions (referring to job scheduling) are independent from route 
transactions (referring to operations scheduling). For this reason, you have to 
decide whether to schedule capacity and to post actual time consumption at 

5.4  Production Order Management 
219 
operations level or at detailed job level. Jobs are not available in a production 
order, if you skip job scheduling. 
If you want to view the route transactions, click the button PRODUCTION 
ORDER/Production details/Route in the production order. Jobs are recorded in a 
separate table, which you can access by clicking the button PRODUCTION 
ORDER/Production details/All jobs in the production order. 
In a resource or resource group, you can view the capacity reservations in various 
inquiries – for example in the capacity load (button RESOURCE/View/Capacity load 
in the action pane of the resource form). Capacity reservations for operations 
scheduling and for job scheduling show separately and as a total. 
 
Figure 5-19: Production route transactions after job scheduling  
In order to run scheduling, click the button SCHEDULE/Production order/Schedule 
operations or SCHEDULE/Production order/Schedule jobs in the action pane of the 
production order. If you want to schedule multiple orders together, execute the 
corresponding periodic activity in the menu folder Production control> Periodic 
tasks> Scheduling. 
On the tab Scheduling parameters of the update dialog for scheduling, following 
parameters are available: 
 Scheduling direction – Several variants of forward or backward scheduling 
(“Forward form today” applies if empty) 
 Finite capacity and Finite material – Considering resource or item availability 
 Keep warehouse from resource – Prevents selecting a resource assigned to a 
different input warehouse when re-scheduling a production order (applicable if 
the checkbox Resource consumption in BOM lines is selected) 
 Schedule references – Scheduling sub-production orders in parallel 
 Primary resource selection – Only for job scheduling, specifying whether 
capability-based resource selection should primarily search for the shortest 
duration (latest start date when scheduling backwards) or for the highest 
priority (i.e. the lowest priority number – priority “1” is selected first) 
In addition, you can select to skip job types on the tab Cancellation if applicable. 
This applies for example, if you want to skip setup time when producing the same 

220 
5  Production Control 
product again, or if you want to skip queue time for a particular production order 
of high importance. 
If you do not execute operations or job scheduling as a separate task, scheduling 
runs automatically when updating to a later status (e.g. immediately releasing the 
order). In this case, the Scheduling method on the tab Automatic update of the 
production control parameters specifies whether Dynamics AX runs operations 
scheduling or job scheduling. 
In order to take changes in orders and resource availability into account, you 
usually re-run scheduling in the course of time for orders which are not yet 
released. When rescheduling production orders, the related capacity reservations 
are deleted and replaced by new reservations. 
5.4.3.4 Releasing 
At the time you want to transfer the production order to the shop floor, you have 
to release the order. Once released, the production order is available in the 
manufacturing execution system (shop floor control module) in Dynamics AX. 
Apart from releasing an order by clicking the button PRODUCTION ORDER/ 
Process/Release in the production order form, the Production floor management 
workspace provides a convenient way for releasing: 
Clicking the tile Production orders to release in the left pane of the workspace opens 
the Production orders to release form, which shows orders not yet released in the 
upper pane and the related critical on-hand inventory in the lower pane. Taking 
the material availability into account, you can release an order by clicking the 
button Release in the toolbar of the upper pane there. 
On the tab General of the update dialog for releasing, you can choose to print 
production papers like job cards or route cards. Selecting the checkbox References 
releases referenced sub-production orders in parallel. 
5.4.3.5 Starting 
Starting a production order (button PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Start) is a 
required step before posting inventory and resource transactions. If you do not 
want to start the entire production quantity, you can enter a partial quantity on the 
tab General of the update dialog for starting. Entering a From Oper.No. and a To 
Oper.No. only starts the selected operations. 
The automatic posting of resource consumption (working time consumption) is 
controlled by the field group Route card journal on the tab General of the update 
dialog. The field Route card there specifies the journal name for posting, initialized 
with a default from the production control parameters. In the lookup Automatic 
route consumption, the following options are available for automatic posting: 

5.5  Production Journal Transactions 
221 
 Route group dependent – Automatic consumption depending on the route 
group of the operation (see section 5.3.3) 
 Always – Automatic consumption of all route operations 
 Never – No automatic consumption 
The slider Post route card now controls whether to post the consumption journal 
immediately. If automatic route consumption is selected without setting this slider 
to “Yes”, Dynamics AX generates a route card journal for manual editing (without 
posting it automatically). automatic consumption is posted through route cards 
Controlling automatic BOM consumption in the field group Picking list journal of 
the update dialog works similar to the automatic route consumption. If you want 
to post automatic consumption depending on the settings in the BOM lines, choose 
the option “Flushing principle” (see section 5.2.1) in the lookup field Automatic 
BOM consumption. This option refers to the corresponding field on the tab Setup of 
the production BOM line details. 
Setting the slider Print picking list in the update dialog to “Yes” prints the picking 
list in parallel to order starting. If you want to print a complete picking list, set the 
slider Complete picking list journal to “Yes”. The picking list otherwise only contains 
items, which are included in the picking list journal generated for automatic 
consumption. 
5.4.3.6 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in order processing include the Production floor management 
workspace and the related release order page showing critical inventory. 
5.4.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 5.8 – Production Order 
There is a demand for five pieces of the finished item created in exercise 5.2. Enter 
a corresponding production order and check the BOM and the route in the order. 
Exercise 5.9 – Change Status 
You want to process the production order of exercise 5.8, starting with estimation. 
Once the estimation is finished, check the price calculation. Then execute 
operations scheduling and job scheduling one after the other. Once scheduling is 
finished, release the order from the Production floor management workspace. 
Finally start the order, making sure to print a complete picking list as a print 
preview. You do not want to post the picking list. Is it possible to apply these 
settings as a default for all users? 
5.5 
Production Journal Transactions 
Reporting of actual material and working time consumption is required to know 
the current inventory and to analyze production performance. 

222 
5  Production Control 
Basically, this reporting is done through production journals you can create and 
post in one of the following ways: 
 Manually – Entering and posting journals (usually done in the office based on 
manual reports of the shop floor). 
 Automatically – Creating journals based on route group and flushing principle. 
 Through terminals or devices – Applying the manufacturing execution system 
(shop floor control module) in Dynamics AX, you can report consumption on 
touch-screen terminals or mobile devices in the shop floor. 
In a warehouse applying advanced warehouse management, the consumption of 
material and the receipt of the finished item is registered through mobile device 
transactions (see section 8.1.3). 
5.5.1 
Journal Transaction and Ledger Integration 
Production journals for posting consumption include following types: 
 Picking list – Item consumption 
 Route card – Resource consumption (working time) referring to operations 
 Job card – Resource consumption (working time) referring to jobs 
The journal type “Report as finished” does not refer to item consumption, but to 
the receipt of finished products in inventory. 
If automatic resource and item consumption applies (route group, flushing 
principle), Dynamics AX creates production journals automatically (Route card for 
resource consumption and Picking list for item consumption) when starting a 
production order or when reporting as finished. Production journals are also 
generated automatically, if registrations are transferred from the manufacturing 
execution system. 
For BOM lines or route operations which are not posted automatically, you have to 
create production journals and enter transactions manually as described below. 
5.5.1.1 Journal Setup 
As a prerequisite for posting transactions in manufacturing, you have to set up the 
required journals in the form Production control> Setup> Production journal names. 
Picking lists, route cards, job cards, and report as finished journals refer to different 
journal names, which you have to set up selecting the appropriate Journal type. 
5.5.1.2 Ledger Integration 
When posting production journal transactions, Dynamics AX posts the 
consumption to clearing accounts for WIP (work in progress). When ending and 
costing a production order, item and resource consumption are posted to the final 
ledger accounts. 
As a prerequisite for posting item consumption to WIP accounts, the slider Post 
picking list in ledger on tab General of the production control parameters has to be 

5.5  Production Journal Transactions 
223 
set to “Yes” (not required for standard cost items). In addition, the checkbox Post 
physical inventory on the tab Costing method & cost recognition in the item model 
group of the picked item has to be selected. 
Like ledger transactions referring to packing slips in purchasing and sales, general 
ledger transactions for route/job consumption journals and picking lists are 
reversed when ending and costing the production order. 
5.5.2 
Picking List 
Picking list journals are there for posting item consumption. In order to access the 
picking list journals, click the button VIEW/Journals/Picking list in the action pane of 
the production order form or open the form Production control> Adjustments> 
Picking list. 
Production journals are documents consisting of a journal header and journal lines. 
When accessing the picking list journals, the list page shows all open journal which 
are not posted yet. Applying an appropriate filter on the column Posted (you can 
use the filter pane, the grid column filter, or the advanced filter) provides the 
option to view also posted journals. 
5.5.2.1 Creating Picking List Journals 
If you want to create a new journal, click the button New in the action pane of the 
list page. After selecting an appropriate journal name in the Create dialog, 
Dynamics AX switches to the journal detail form in lines view. 
In order to facilitate picking list registration, you can click the button Picking list/ 
Create lines in the journal list page instead of the button New. In the Create lines 
dialog, you can select which production BOM lines should be used as default for 
the proposal. Selecting “Remaining quantity” in the field Proposal applies the open 
BOM line quantity as default to the column Proposal of the picking list lines. If you 
set the slider Consumption=Proposal to “Yes”, the column Consumption in the journal 
lines also receives the proposal quantity. In this case, you can immediately post the 
journal without manual data entry (consuming the estimated quantity). 
5.5.2.2 Journal Lines 
From the journal list page, you can access the journal detail form by clicking the 
journal ID shown as link in the grid of the journal page. Clicking the button Header 
below the action pane in the detail form switches to the header view, where you 
can view the complete journal header. 
When manually entering a regular picking list line in the lines view, you have to 
select a Lot ID linking the consumption to a production BOM line before entering 
the Consumption quantity. Selecting the checkbox in the column End of the journal 
line sets the production BOM line to finished, no matter if consuming the total 
estimated quantity or less. 

224 
5  Production Control 
If you consume an item which is not included in the BOM lines of the production 
order, insert a picking list line entering the item number and leaving the lot ID 
empty. Dynamics AX in this case automatically creates a corresponding BOM line 
in the production order and applies the lot ID to the picking list line. 
 
Figure 5-20: Entering an additional picking list line in a picking list journal 
Figure 5-20 shows an example of lines in a picking list journal, which are generated 
by a consumption proposal. The checkbox Consumption=Proposal has been selected 
in the consumption proposal dialog, which is why the column Consumption in the 
journal lines contains default values for the actual quantity. The last line in Figure 
5-20 shows a manual entry for an item not included in the BOM. The columns 
Proposal and – only before saving the line – Lot ID are therefore empty in this line. 
Once you have finished entering the picking list, post the journal by clicking the 
button Post in the journal list page or detail form. In inventory, the posted 
transactions reduce the quantity of the picked items similar to the packing slip 
transactions of sales orders. 
Inventory valuation is applying a preliminary physical value to the picking list 
journal posting. Financial valuation is posted later when ending and costing the 
production order. 
5.5.2.3 Inquiries and Reversal 
If you want to view a posted journal, access the picking list journal form and apply 
an appropriate filter on the column Posted. The posted journal shows a checkmark 
in the column Posted and does not allow modifications. 
Alternatively, you can view the posted transactions in the production posting 
form. In order to access this form, click the button MANAGE COSTS/Production 
accounting/Production posting in the production order form or access the menu item 
Production control> Inquiries and reports> Production> Production posting. 
If you want to reverse a posted picking list journal, register and post a picking list 
journal with negative quantities. In order to facilitate registration, you can create 

5.5  Production Journal Transactions 
225 
an appropriate picking list proposal by clicking the button Picking list/Create lines 
and selecting the option “Full reversal” in the field Proposal of the proposal dialog. 
5.5.3 
Consumption of Resources 
Depending on route group settings and on the way of scheduling the order, you 
have to use route cards or job cards to record resource consumption. Resource 
consumption is the usage of a resource, usually measured by the working time. 
5.5.3.1 Route Card and Job Card 
Route card journals are used to register resource consumption at operation level. 
You should use route cards if you only run operations scheduling but no job 
scheduling, or if the settings in the route group (checkboxes Job management on the 
tab Setup cleared) of an operation prevent using job cards. 
Job card journals are used to register resource consumption at job level. Jobs are 
created when executing job scheduling. Depending on the route group settings, 
you should use job cards instead of route cards if there are jobs for an operation.  
Automatic resource consumption when starting or reporting as finished is posted 
through route cards. Registrations transferred from the manufacturing execution 
system apply job card or route card journals depending on the setup (Production 
control> Setup> Manufacturing execution> Production order defaults, lookup Job level on 
the tab Operations). 
5.5.3.2 Journal Registration 
You can access the route card journals by clicking the button VIEW/Journals/Route 
card in the action pane of the production order form or through the menu item 
Production control> Adjustments> Route card. For job cards, click the button VIEW/ 
Journals/Job card in the production order or access the menu item Production control> 
Adjustments> Job card. 
Entering journal headers and lines for resource consumption works similar to 
entering picking list journals. But except for automatic consumption (option when 
starting an order or reporting as finished), there is no consumption proposal for 
route cards or job cards. 
When inserting a journal line for resource consumption, select the operation 
number (or the job identification) first. Then enter the resource, the number of 
hours, the produced quantity (Good quantity), the task type (only in route cards, in 
job cards automatically from the job), and other data as applicable – e.g. the 
defective quantity (Error quantity) of the finished product. In a job card, you should 
additionally enter the start time, the end time, and the worker as applicable. 
Once you have finished entering the journal lines, post the journal clicking the 
button Post in the journal list page or detail form. 

226 
5  Production Control 
If you want to view the posted journal afterwards, access the route card or job card 
journal form and apply an appropriate filter on the column Posted. In addition, you 
can view the posted transactions in the route transactions inquiry (button 
MANAGE COSTS/Cost transactions/Route transactions in the production order) or in 
the posting inquiry (MANAGE COSTS/Production accounting/Production posting). 
5.5.3.3 Reporting as Finished 
When registering the last operation or job in a journal line, you can select the 
checkbox in the column Production report as finished if you want to post a report as 
finished journal for the produced item in parallel to the route card or job card. The 
default for the report as finished setting in journal lines is specified in the 
production control parameters (tab Journals, slider Automatic report as finished). 
5.5.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 5.10 – Purchasing Components 
In order to process the production order of exercise 5.8, the required components 
have to be available in inventory. 
Enter a purchase order, purchasing nine units of the first and five units of the 
second item of exercise 5.1 from your vendor of exercise 3.2. Once you have 
finished entering and confirming the purchase order, post the product receipt and 
the vendor invoice. 
Exercise 5.11 – Picking List 
You can pick the components required for the production order of exercise 5.8 
now. Enter and post a picking list journal, picking nine units of the first and five 
units of the second item. You do not expect any additional consumption. Pick from 
the warehouse where you have received the items in exercise 5.10. 
Exercise 5.12 – Job Card 
Choosing a job card, you want to record the actual working time for executing the 
manufacturing operation. Enter and post a job card referring to the production 
order of exercise 5.8, producing five units in the time between 8:00 AM and 2:00 
PM (6 hours). You do not want to post reporting as finished in parallel. 
5.6 
Reporting as Finished and Ending Production 
In the cycle of production order processing, reporting as finished and ending are 
the last steps. Reporting as finished posts physical transactions and increases the 
inventory quantity of the finished product. Ending the order then performs costing 
and posts the financial transactions. 
5.6.1 
Reporting as Finished 
Reporting as finished physically receives the finished item in inventory. In 
Dynamics AX, there are following options to report a production order as finished: 

5.6  Reporting as Finished and Ending Production 
227 
 Order status update – Updating the status of the production order 
 Production journal – Posting a report as finished journal 
 Time registration – Reporting as finished when posting the route card or job 
card for the last operation 
 Advanced warehouse management – Transactions on the mobile device 
The production input journal (Inventory management> Journal entries> Item arrival> 
Production input) provides the option to post an inventory registration before 
reporting as finished – similar to arrival journals in purchasing (see section 3.5.3). 
5.6.1.1 Order Status Update 
In order to report as finished by updating the order status, click the button 
PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Report as finished in the action pane of the 
production order form or execute the periodic activity Production control> Periodic 
tasks> Production order status update> Report as finished. If you want to report only a 
part of the entire order quantity, adjust the Good quantity on the tab Overview or the 
tab General of the update dialog before clicking the button OK. 
If you do not expect additional receipts for the current order to be reported as 
finished, set the slider End job to “Yes” (clearing any remaining open quantity). 
If you are sure that the actual consumption of items and resources has been 
completely posted already and you do not want to receive messages concerning 
missing consumption (compared to the estimation), set the slider Accept error on 
the tab General to “Yes”. 
5.6.1.2 Production Journal 
Apart from the status update, reporting as finished is also possible by posting a 
production journal. In order to access this journal, click the button 
VIEW/Journals/Reported as finished in the action pane of the production order form, 
or choose the menu item Production control> Adjustments> Report as finished. 
The way to work in the report as finished journal is similar to the picking list 
journal (see section 5.5.2). But posting a report as finished journal generates 
transactions which are similar to product receipts in purchase orders: Inventory 
physically receives the item with a preliminary value and increases the on-hand 
quantity. 
5.6.1.3 Automatic Consumption 
Like when starting the production order, automatic item and resource 
consumption is also possible when reporting as finished. On the tab General in the 
dialog when reporting as finished, the field groups Route card journal and Picking 
list journal for this purpose control automatic consumption. 
If you post automatic consumption when starting and when reporting as finished, 
select the flushing principle “Start” in the BOM line for consumption when starting 
the production order, and “Finish” for consumption when reporting as finished. 

228 
5  Production Control 
This setting allows consuming some items when starting and other items when 
finishing of a production order. 
Route operations do not show this option. For all operations with automatic 
posting, you have to decide in common for the production order, whether 
automatic posting should apply when starting or when reporting as finished. In 
order to avoid duplicate posting, select the option “Route group dependent” in the 
lookup field Automatic route consumption only in the dialog for starting, or only for 
reporting as finished – not in both dialogs. 
5.6.1.4 Ledger Integration 
If you want to post the finished items to clearing accounts in the general ledger 
when reporting as finished, ledger integration has to be activated for reporting as 
finished. For this purpose, set the slider Post report as finished in ledger on tab 
General of the production control parameters to “Yes” (not required for standard 
cost items). In addition, the checkbox Post physical inventory on the tab Costing 
method & cost recognition in the item model group of the finished item has to be 
selected. 
General ledger transactions for reporting as finished are reversed when ending and 
costing the production order. 
5.6.1.5 Reporting Scrap 
Scrap specified in the BOM or in the route is planned scrap, which is included in 
the estimated consumption of items and resources. The cost analysis therefore does 
not show it as deviation. A deviation only applies if you post excess resource 
(working time) or item consumption. In this context, data in the field group Scrap 
in the line details of the picking list journal are just for information purpose. 
Scrapping a finished product in the course of production order processing is 
unplanned scrap. You can report this scrap by entering an Error quantity when 
reporting as finished. The default for the error quantity is the total of the reported 
error quantity of all operations. 
From a financial perspective, you can allocate the costs for finished product scrap 
to the good quantity (which means that the good quantity carries all costs of the 
production order) or post scrap to a separate scrap account (default on the tab 
Standard update in the production control parameters). If you apply a scrap account, 
ending the production order posts an inventory receipt and an immediate issue 
(posting against the scrap account) for scrap when ending the order. Only when 
using a scrap account, you can completely scrap an order (no good quantity). 
The scrap account option does not apply to finished products with standard costs. 
5.6.2 
Ending and Costing 
Ending a production order is required for cost-accounting and closing the order. In 
parallel, WIP ledger transactions for production journals are reversed. 

5.6  Reporting as Finished and Ending Production 
229 
Consumption of items and resources and receipts of finished items post to the final 
ledger accounts. 
You should end a production order in time. The finished item otherwise is still 
included in the WIP account balance instead of the stock account balance. 
5.6.2.1 Ending 
Ending an order closes it. Since it is not possible to post any transaction for a closed 
production order, you should not end the order until you are sure all transactions 
have been posted. 
In order to end the production order, click the button PRODUCTION 
ORDER/Process/End in the action pane of the production order form. If you want to 
end multiple orders, execute the corresponding periodic activity in the menu item 
Production control> Periodic tasks> Production order status update> End. 
After ending, the ending date of the production order shows in the field Financial 
date of the inventory transactions. The receipt status in inventory transactions of 
items reported as finished is “Purchased”. For consumed items (BOM lines), the 
issue status is “Sold”. 
5.6.2.2 Costing 
Costing a production order is the corresponding action to invoicing purchase and 
sales orders. When costing the order in the course of the ending routine, 
Dynamics AX calculates the actual costs for all item and resource consumption 
transactions. Based on these actual costs of the production order, the cost price of 
the finished item is calculated. If standard cost valuation applies to the finished 
item, costing posts the cost price differences to variance accounts. 
 
Figure 5-21: Comparing estimation and costing in the calculation form 

230 
5  Production Control 
In order to compare the actual and the estimated consumption, click the button 
MANAGE COSTS/Calculations/View calculation details in the action pane of the 
production order form. The tab Overview Costing of the price calculation form then 
shows – at item and operation line level – a comparison of estimated and realized 
quantity consumption, and of estimated and realized costs. The tab Costing sheet 
contains a summary of estimation or costing according to the costing sheet setup. 
5.6.2.3 Ledger Integration and Inquiries 
Like when posting invoices in purchasing or sales, costing a production order 
posts financial transactions for the items consumed and reported as finished. First, 
costing reverses the WIP ledger transactions posted through picking list journals, 
route card journals, job card journals, and report as finished journals. In a second 
step, costing posts following ledger transactions to close the order financially: 
 Consumption of components – To the stock accounts of the BOM line items 
 Consumption of resources – To the costing accounts of the resources 
 Receiving the finished item – To the stock account of the finished item 
 Indirect costs – To the financial accounts as specified in the costing sheet 
For the item transactions, applicable main accounts are specified in the inventory 
posting setup (Inventory management> Setup> Posting> Posting). For resource 
consumption, main accounts can derive from settings in the resource/resource 
group or in applicable cost categories. Apart from these settings, production 
groups are an alternative way to specify applicable main accounts for item and 
resource transactions. 
Receiving a default from the production control parameters, the lookup Ledger on 
the tab Setup of the production order detail form determines which setting actually 
applies to retrieve appropriate main accounts (see section 9.4.3). 
In order to view the transactions generated when ending and costing the order, 
click the button MANAGE COSTS/Production accounting/Production posting in the 
action pane of the production order form or access the menu item Production 
control> Inquiries and reports> Production> Production posting. In the production 
posting inquiry, the transactions posted when ending and costing the production 
order show the type “Costing”. In order to view related ledger transactions, click 
the button Voucher in the action pane. 
5.6.3 
Case Study Exercise 
Exercise 5.13 – Ending Production 
By clicking the button Process/Report as finished in the production order form, report 
the entire quantity of the production order in exercise 5.8 as finished. On the tab 
General of the update dialog, set the slider End job to “Yes”. Then end the 
production order and check the price calculation inquiry to compare estimation 
and costing afterwards. 

5.7  Subcontracting 
231 
5.7 
Subcontracting 
If a company cannot process a particular operation internally for technological 
reasons or because of the current capacity utilization, this operation is often 
subcontracted to an external vendor. BOM and/or route of the finished item then 
have to include the subcontracted service. 
Some finished products are alternatively produced internally or at a subcontractor. 
In order to manage these alternatives, you have to work with two or more 
approved route and/or BOM versions for the item (like when using different 
resources for the same item depending on the production size). 
In Dynamics AX, there are two basic options for subcontracting: 
 Outsourced operation – Resource of the type “Vendor” in an operation 
 Purchased service – Service item with the line type “Vendor” in a BOM line 
Since a purchase order line needs to contain a physical item or a service item 
(procurement categories are not available for this purpose), only the second option 
includes creating a purchase order. 
5.7.1 
Outsourced Operation 
You can use an outsourced operation, which is not linked to a BOM line with a 
service item, if you do not need to generate a purchase order – for example if there 
is a contract with a fixed capacity reservation and a fixed monthly fee. 
In this case, create a separate resource group and resource per subcontractor. The 
resource is similar to a regular internal resource (see section 5.3.2), but applies the 
Type “Vendor” providing the option to enter the vendor number in the field Vendor 
on the tab General of the resource form. In addition, apply appropriate settings for 
the cost categories (depending on the contract, maybe only a Quantity category) and 
for the main accounts, making sure to post the right amount to the right accounts. 
Settings for the calendar and for finite capacity are depending on the contract. 
In the related route operation, select the Route type “Vendor” on the tab General and 
enter the vendor resource as Costing resource together with appropriate resource 
requirements. Processing the outsourced operation in a production order works 
similar to processing a regular internal operation. 
5.7.2 
Purchased Service 
If you need a purchase order for the outsourced operation, create a service item 
and include it in the BOM of the finished product. For scheduling purposes, you 
can link the BOM line with the service item to an outsourced operation. 
5.7.2.1 Master Data for Purchasing Subcontracting Services 
The required service item is a product with the Product type “Service”, an Item 
model group generating inventory transactions (“Stocked product”), and the Default 
order type “Purchase order”. In the Cost group on the tab Manage costs of the 

232 
5  Production Control 
released product, you can select a cost group of the type “Direct outsourcing”. The 
flushing principle should be “Finish”. Other relevant settings in the released 
product include the item group, the cost price, the dimension groups, the units of 
measure, the purchase price, the main vendor, the default order settings, and the 
site-specific order settings. 
In the BOM of the finished product, insert a BOM line with the service item and the 
Line type “Vendor”, optionally including a Vendor account which overrides the main 
vendor from the released product. 
 
Figure 5-22: Settings in a BOM line for a subcontracted service 
If you need an outsourced operation for scheduling purposes, you can set it up as 
described in the previous section. But unlike the settings for an outsourced 
operation which is not linked to a BOM line service item, the operation should 
contain a route group with settings for automatic consumption and – if all 
subcontracting costs are included in the service item – deactivated cost calculation 
(sliders in the field group Estimation and costing of the route group set to “No”). In 
order to link the BOM line with the service item (for purchasing the subcontracted 
activity) to the outsourced operation (for scheduling the subcontracted activity), 
select the appropriate operation number in the field Oper.No. on the tab General of 
the BOM line and make sure that the slider End there is set to “Yes” (you do not 
consume the service item before the operation is finished). 
If material is supplied to the subcontractor, link the BOM lines of the appropriate 
components to the outsourced operation in the same way as linking BOM lines to 
an internal operation. 

5.7  Subcontracting 
233 
5.7.2.2 Production Order Processing with Purchased Services 
You can manually or automatically create production orders including 
subcontracted service items in the same way as regular production orders (see 
section 5.4.2). When estimating the production order, a purchase order is created 
for the BOM line with the service item (triggered by the line type “Vendor” and the 
default order type “Purchase order”). The reference to the purchase order shows in 
the columns Reference type and Number of the production BOM lines (access by 
clicking the button PRODUCTION ORDER/Production details/BOM in the order). 
Like any other purchase order, the order has to be confirmed before receiving the 
service item. 
Scheduling and releasing a production order with a subcontracted service is 
similar to any other production order. 
Once you want to start the order, you can optionally use the list page Production 
control> Subcontracted work and click the button Start in the action pane after 
selecting the order there. On the tab General in the Start dialog, make sure to apply 
appropriate settings for automatic consumption (not consuming BOM items which 
are consumed when receiving the purchase order). In the Print options for the 
picking list (button in the Start dialog), you can set the slider Use delivery note layout 
for the picking list to “Yes” if you supply BOM items as components to the 
subcontractor. 
When posting the product receipt for the purchase order afterwards, settings in the 
field group Receive purchase order on the tab Automatic update of the production 
control parameters determine if BOM and route consumption is posted in parallel 
to the product receipt. Choosing the option “Flushing principle” for the Automatic 
BOM consumption in the parameters provides the option to post the consumption 
only for particular BOM lines (included the service item). 
Reporting the production order as finished and ending the order works as usual. 
5.7.2.3 Item Transfer to Subcontractors 
If you just enter an additional BOM line (with the service item) and an additional 
operation (with the vendor resource) in the regular BOM and route as described 
above, you can assign material to any operation (through the operation number in 
the BOM line) before or after the external operation (or to the external operation 
itself, if applicable). Depending on this assignment, consumption of components is 
before or after the external operation. There is no inventory transfer of a semi-
finished item to or from the subcontractor. 
In case you transfer a semi-finished item to the subcontractor after some internal 
operations, and you want to keep control of the material flow with the 
subcontractor, you have to apply additional BOM levels: Create a semi-finished 
item containing all items and operations before the external operation, and a 
second semi-finished item after the external operation. Both items got the default 

234 
5  Production Control 
order type “Production”. Components of the second semi-finished item are the 
first semi-finished item (line type “Pegged supply”) and the subcontracting service 
item (and additional material directly supplied to the subcontractor if applicable). 
The BOM of the finished product contains the second semi-finished item (select the 
line type “Vendor”) and the material required for later operations. 
With this setup, there is a sub-production order for producing the first semi-
finished item, which you receive in inventory by posting a report as finished 
transaction. You can transfer the item afterwards using a regular transfer order, 
and consume it when producing the upper-level production order (type “Vendor”) 
of second semi-finished item. Processing the production order of the second semi-
finished item works as described above for the simple scenario. When receiving the 
second semi-finished item from the subcontractor, report it as finished and 
consume it in the upper-level production order for the finished product. 
5.8 
Formula and Batch Production Order 
Whereas discrete manufacturing is used to produce a distinct item assembled of 
several components, process manufacturing supports a continuous production 
process generating one or more batch-controlled formula items and co-products. 
Production control in Dynamics AX supports the requirements of process 
industries by use of formulas (instead of discrete bills of materials). Resource and 
route management in process manufacturing uses the same functionality as 
discrete manufacturing. 
If you are working in a discrete manufacturing environment, but have some 
requirements covered by process manufacturing features, you can use formulas. 
You can for example use a formula with co-products for a cutting operation, even 
if the items are not batch-controlled. The product configurator is not supported by 
formulas. 
5.8.1 
Formula Management 
Formula management is based on bills of materials. Formulas, formula lines, and 
formula versions show the same concepts and functionality as bills of materials, 
BOM lines, and BOM versions. But in addition to the functionality in bills of 
materials, they include following core features: 
 Co-products and by-products – Producing more than one product in parallel 
 Catch weight items (see section 7.2.1) – As finished product and as component 
In addition, there are features which help managing the quantity in formula lines 
(yield, percent controlled, scalable), and other options like the plan group 
supporting item substitutions. 

5.8  Formula and Batch Production Order 
235 
5.8.1.1 Product Data for Formula Items 
Formula items are finished items, which are produced using a formula. When 
creating such an item in the released product form, you can use similar settings to 
a BOM item (including the default order type “Production”). Although there are 
settings which are more common in process industry than in discrete 
manufacturing (e.g. weight as inventory unit), the only mandatory difference is the 
Production type on the tab Engineer with following options for process industry: 
 Formula – Main item produced from the assigned formula 
 Co-product – Item produced from a formula in parallel to a main item 
 By-product – Like a co-product, but undesirable (causing costs instead of value) 
 Planning item – Virtual main item, if a formula only produces co-products 
Planning items are used, if there is no clear physical main item but equal co-
products in a formula (e.g. in a refinery producing gasoline and diesel in parallel). 
You can assign a formula only to an item with the production type “Formula” or 
“Planning item”. Co-products and by-products are produced in a production order 
for the related formula or planning item. If there is a main formula or planning 
item for producing the co-product, you can enter the appropriate item number in 
the field Planning formula below the production type. 
5.8.1.2 Working with Formulas 
Managing formulas in Dynamics AX is similar to managing bills of materials, 
including the way to access the formula form: 
 From the released product (Product information management> Products> Released 
products, button ENGINEER/Formula/Formula versions) 
 From the menu (Product information management> Bills of materials and formulas> 
Formulas) 
Like the assignment of BOMs, the assignment of formulas to finished items is 
called “Version”, optionally specifying site, validity dates, and from-quantity. 
Accessing the formula from the released product is only possible for items with the 
production type “Formula” or “Planning item”. If you access the formula form 
from the menu, the list page shows all formulas. Clicking a formula ID shown as 
link in the grid of the list page opens the formula detail form in the lines view, 
where you can see the formula lines. Clicking the button Header below the action 
pane in the detail form switches to the header view, where you can view the 
formula versions (assignment of formula items or planning items to the formula). 
The field Formula size in the formula version provides the default for the column 
Per series in the formula lines and is the default quantity when entering a 
production order for the particular product. 
Co-products and by-products are optional. You can edit them in the formula detail 
form after clicking the button Co-products in the toolbar of the tab Formula versions 

236 
5  Production Control 
(or the button FORMULA VERSION/Maintain formula version/Co-products in the 
action pane of the formula version form accessed from the released product). In the 
co-product form, you can add co-products and by-products with the respective 
quantity in the middle pane. For a co-product, you can select the Co-product cost 
allocation “Manual” and enter the Cost allocation percent. This percentage determines 
the inventory value of the co-product (specifying the percentage of the total 
production costs allocated to the co-product). For a by-product, you can specify the 
costs added to production (e.g. for disposal) by selecting the By-product cost 
allocation. 
Like bills of materials, formulas and formula versions have to be approved before 
they are available for production orders. 
5.8.2 
Batch Production Order 
Batch orders are production orders for formula items. There is no separate form for 
batch orders, they use the regular production order form. In the production control 
parameters, you can select a separate number sequence for batch orders or choose 
the same number sequence as for regular production orders. 
The ways for creating a batch order are the same as for creating a regular discrete 
production order: Apart from manually entering it, you can create it automatically 
from master planning (including co-product demand in the calculation – select a 
Planning formula in the planned order if not specified in the released product), from 
an upper-level production order (line type “Pegged supply”), or from a sales order. 
If you want to create a batch order manually, click the button New/Batch order in 
the Production floor management workspace or the button New batch order in the 
production order form and select the formula item in the Create dialog. It is not 
possible to select a co-product as order header item, but a related formula item or a 
planning item. 
When creating a batch production order, Dynamics AX copies the active formula 
and route of the formula item into the order. In the order, you can access the 
formula lines (showing the components) by clicking the button PRODUCTION 
ORDER/Production details/Formula and the co-/by-products by clicking the button 
PRODUCTION ORDER/Production details/Co-products. 
Processing the batch order – from estimation to ending – is not different from a 
regular production order except when reporting as finished: In addition to the 
receipt of the formula item, you can report co-products and by-products as 
finished. 
When ending and costing a batch order with co-products or by-products, costs are 
allocated to the co-products according to the settings in the formula, and the 
additional costs caused by by-products are posted as route transaction with a 
burden cost category (specified in the production control parameters).

Operations Planning 
The primary responsibility of operations planning is to make sure that items are 
available when needed while meeting the target of high economic efficiency at the 
same time. Operations planning accordingly has to solve the conflicting priorities 
of high supply readiness on the one hand and low inventory on the other. 
6.1 
Business Processes in Operations Planning 
In Dynamics AX, long-term forecasting and short-term master planning are 
covered by the operations planning module (“Master planning”). 
6.1.1 
Basic Approach 
Operations planning includes forecasting to identify the item demand on a long-
term basis. Master planning is used to calculate supply and demand on a short-
term basis. 
 
Figure 6-1: 
Operations planning in Dynamics AX (Forecasts and master planning) 
6.1.1.1 Forecasting 
Forecasting is a long-term prognosis for planning and budgeting purposes. It 
includes demand forecasts (sales and other issues) and supply forecasts 
(purchasing and other receipts). Different versions of forecasts provide the option 
to work with multiple parallel scenarios. 
6.1.1.2 Master Planning 
Master planning is the short-term planning for daily business. Based on current 
orders, on-hand inventory, sales quotations, and forecasts (as specified in the 
configuration), master planning calculates the item demand and supply. As a 
result, it generates actual and planned orders for purchasing, transfer, and 
production. Master planning, like forecasting, provides the option to use multiple 
scenarios in parallel. A core planning strategy supported by Dynamics AX is to 
maintain a static master plan for current master planning and a dynamic plan for 
simulation.

6  Operations Planning 
6.1.2 
At a Glance: Master Planning 
Before we start to go through the details of master planning, this section shows the 
basics on the example of the net requirements for a manufactured item. 
As a basis for net requirements calculation, enter a sales order to be delivered 
today with a line containing a manufactured item (default order type 
“Production”) which is out of stock. Clicking the button Product and supply/Net 
requirements in the toolbar of the sales order line provides access to the net 
requirements form, which shows the item availability. In order to update the net 
requirements with current data, execute local master planning by clicking the 
button Update/Master planning in the action pane of the net requirements form. 
 
Figure 6-2: 
The net requirements form after running local master planning 
In the described scenario, master planning generates a planned production order 
to produce the manufactured item. Since the planned order needs to start in the 
past to meet the sales order delivery date, the requirement date in this line is 
adjusted to the earliest possible date (depending on the related setting for 
calculated delays in the master plan). The column Delay (days) in the sales order 
requirement shows the calculated delay. 
Master planning supports multiple scenarios, distinguishing between a static and a 
dynamic plan. In the net requirements form, the dynamic plan (used for simulation 
and order promising purposes) is the default when executing master planning. The 
static plan is used in purchasing and production for scheduling and firming 
orders. In order to switch between the different plans, choose the appropriate 
option in the lookup field Plan at the top of the net requirements form. 
 
 

6.2  Forecasting 
239 
6.2 
Forecasting 
Forecasting is a long-term prognosis, required to estimate and adjust future 
capacities of resources and material supply. In addition, you can use forecasting as 
a basis for budgeting in finance. In order to support planning of alternative 
scenarios for business development, you can maintain multiple forecasts in 
parallel. 
Forecasting in Dynamics AX does not only include sales forecasts. Demand 
forecasts also include other sources of item issue – for example production, if you 
want to forecast at semi-finished product level. In addition, you can manage 
supply forecasts – for example as basis for long-term vendor contracts. 
6.2.1 
Basics of Forecasting 
When entering or computing forecast figures in Dynamics AX, you have to select a 
forecast model (representing the planning scenario) which holds the forecast data. 
Forecast plans, which are the basis for calculating forecasts in forecast planning, 
then refer to particular forecast models. Forecast plans are also used in master 
planning as demand and supply source depending on the setup. 
 
Figure 6-3: 
Forecasting in Dynamics AX 
6.2.1.1 Demand Forecast 
Forecasting the future demand based on estimated sales figures is the starting 
point of the forecasting process. You can enter a demand forecast at different levels 
of the forecast dimension item, customer, and inventory (site/warehouse). Apart 
from direct sales (sales forecast), the demand forecast might also contain other 

240 
6  Operations Planning 
demand – e.g. the demand for semi-finished items (instead of finished items) if it is 
not possible to specify reliable forecasts at the detail level of finished products. 
Since forecast planning and master planning are based on released products, you 
have to use item allocation keys if you do not want to enter forecasts at the level of 
individual items. Item allocation keys are groups, specifying a percentage for each 
item in the group. 
Apart from manually entering forecasts, Dynamics AX supports the automatic 
generation of demand forecasts through Azure Machine Learning. 
6.2.1.2 Supply Forecasts 
In parallel or after finishing demand forecasts, you can optionally manage separate 
supply forecasts (containing purchases and other types of item receipts). The 
inventory forecast then provides the option to align demand and supply forecasts. 
6.2.1.3 Forecast Planning 
Once you have finished recording forecast figures, you can execute forecast 
planning to calculate the gross requirements of finished items based on their bills 
of materials. As a result of forecast planning, Dynamics AX creates planned 
purchase orders and planned production orders referring to the forecast plan. 
If entered, the supply forecast provides the minimum figures for generating 
planned purchase or production orders, no matter if they exceed the direct and 
indirect demand from the demand forecast. 
Since forecast planning is used as a long-term prognosis, the calculation does not 
include the current inventory and current orders. 
6.2.1.4 Forecasts in Master Planning 
You can include forecasts in master planning. For this purpose, settings in master 
planning determine if and how to include forecasts. 
The Reduction principle in master plans and the Reduction key in coverage groups are 
there to avoid duplicate consideration of future demand. Without reduction, a 
duplicate consideration results from a forecasted demand in upcoming periods in 
which there are already actual sales orders – supposing these sales orders are part 
of the forecasted quantity and not in addition to the forecast. 
6.2.1.5 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
As a result of the cloud-based architecture, Azure Machine Learning-based 
demand forecasting replaces the SQL Server Analysis Services-based demand 
forecasting introduced with Dynamics AX 2012 R3. 
6.2.2 
Forecast Settings 
Before starting to register forecasts, you have to finish the required setup in 
Dynamics AX. 

6.2  Forecasting 
241 
6.2.2.1 Forecast Models 
Forecast models represent the different scenarios in forecasting. In order to use 
forecasts, you have to set up at least one forecast model in the form Master 
planning> Setup> Demand forecasting> Forecast models. 
If you want to structure forecasts (e.g. grouping forecasts by region), you can set 
up two-stage forecasting through submodels. In this case you have to create the 
submodels like regular forecast models first. Then enter the main model and assign 
the submodels on the tab Submodel of the forecast model form. 
If you want to protect forecasts against changes, set the slider Stopped in the 
forecast model to “Yes”. You can use blocking for example if an annual forecast 
should not change once it is finished – use a separate forecast model for the next 
year in this case. 
6.2.2.2 Forecast Plan 
Whereas forecast models are used for entering and storing forecasts, forecast plans 
are the grouping element of separate forecast scenarios in master planning. In 
order to assign forecast models to forecast plans, open the form Master planning> 
Setup> Plans> Forecast plans and select a main model in the lookup field Forecast 
model of the forecast plans. 
The forecast plan also contains settings on whether to include supply or demand 
forecasts. On the tab Time fences in days, enter the periods (starting from the day of 
calculation) which should be covered by forecast planning. 
 
Figure 6-4: 
Selecting a forecast model in the forecast plan 
6.2.2.3 Parameters and Item Allocation Keys 
In the master planning parameters (Master planning> Setup> Master planning 
parameters), the field Current forecast plan determines the default forecast plan for 
displaying forecast planning results. 

242 
6  Operations Planning 
Another important setting for item forecasts is the coverage group, which specifies 
how to summarize net requirements. The Forecast plan time fence on the tab Other in 
the coverage groups determines the applicable period for forecast planning. More 
information on coverage groups is available in section 6.3.3 later in this chapter. 
If you do not want to enter forecasts at the level of individual items, use item 
allocation keys which provide the option to enter a forecast total for a group of 
items. In order to set up item allocation keys, open the form Master planning> 
Setup> Demand forecasting> Item allocation keys. The tab Item allocation in this form 
contains the assigned items with their percentage of the group total. 
Setting up demand forecasting parameters (Master planning> Setup> Demand 
forecasting> Demand forecasting parameters) is required if you want to use Azure 
Machine Learning-based demand forecasting. Azure ML-based demand forecasts 
only include items which are assigned to item allocation keys. Prior to the setup in 
Dynamics AX, an Azure Machine Learning account is required if you want to 
generate forecasts using the Azure Machine Learning strategy. 
6.2.3 
Forecast and Forecast Planning 
Apart from manually entering forecasts, for which you can use Excel integration, 
you can apply Azure ML-based demand forecasting for creating forecasts. 
6.2.3.1 Manual Demand Forecast 
 
Figure 6-5: 
Allocating a sales forecast line across periods 
In order to enter demand forecasts manually, open the form Master planning> 
Forecasting> Manual forecast entry> Demand forecast lines. Alternatively, you can 
access demand forecasts by clicking the button Demand forecast or Forecast in the 

6.2  Forecasting 
243 
action pane of the respective master table form, for example in the released 
product (action pane tab PLAN) or in the customer (action pane tab CUSTOMER). 
Once you are in the demand forecast lines, insert records selecting the appropriate 
(forecast) model. If you want to record different scenarios, enter different models 
in separate lines. In the date column, enter the start date of the individual forecast 
period – for example the first day of a month if entering a line per month. If you 
want to allocate a forecast line across periods, click the button Allocate forecast in 
the toolbar on the tab Overview and enter allocation details in the following dialog. 
You can facilitate the manual forecast entry through bulk updates (button Bulk 
update on the tab Overview) or through Excel integration. In order to use Excel, click 
the button 
 /Edit demand forecast in Excel in the action pane, change and add lines 
in Excel as appropriate, and publish the data back to Dynamics AX. 
6.2.3.2 Azure Machine Learning-Based Demand Forecasting 
As alternative to manually entering demand forecast lines, you can create them 
through Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML). The Azure ML-based demand 
forecasting calculates forecasts based on historical demand (originating from 
inventory transactions in Dynamics AX). 
Once item allocation keys and demand forecasting parameters are set up, you can 
access the adjusted demand forecast form (Master planning> Forecasting> Demand 
forecasting> Adjusted demand forecast) and click the button Generate statistical baseline 
forecast to calculate the forecast using Azure ML with specified algorithm 
parameters (Master planning> Setup> Demand forecasting> Forecasting algorithm 
parameters, optionally override in demand forecasting parameters). 
The forecast data in the adjusted demand forecast can be updated as required 
before creating the actual demand forecast lines by clicking the button Authorize 
adjusted demand forecast. 
6.2.3.3 Supply Forecast and Inventory Forecast 
If you want to maintain a supply forecast independently from the demand forecast, 
enter it in the form Master planning> Forecasting> Supply forecast lines or by clicking 
the button Supply forecast or Forecast in the action pane of the respective master 
table form (released product, vendor) similar to the demand forecast. Depending 
on the setup, forecast planning then includes the supply forecast in parallel to the 
demand forecast. 
Inventory forecasts show the result of supply and demand forecasts at the level of 
item numbers and periods. You can access inventory forecasts in appropriate 
master table forms by clicking the button Inventory forecast. 
6.2.3.4 Forecast Planning 
The results of forecasts for trade items, finished items, and raw materials are a 
valuable basis to prepare production and purchasing for the future. 

244 
6  Operations Planning 
In order to determine forecast data on multiple BOM levels, you can perform 
forecast planning (Master planning> Forecasting> Forecast planning). The update 
dialog for forecast planning contains the lookup field Forecast plan for selecting the 
forecast plan to be calculated. 
The results of forecast planning are available in the gross requirements form, 
which you can access by clicking the button PLAN/Requirements/Gross requirement 
in the action pane of the released product form. By default, the form shows the 
forecast plan set up as current forecast plan in the master planning parameters. The 
lookup field Plan at the top of the gross requirements form provides the option to 
select a different plan if applicable. Apart from the gross requirements form, also 
the planned order page Master planning> Master planning> Planned orders – after 
selecting the forecast plan in the lookup field Plan – shows planned orders 
generated by forecast planning. 
6.2.3.5 Budget Transfer 
If you want to use the results of demand or supply forecasting for financial 
budgets, transfer them to ledger budgets. For this purpose, execute the periodic 
activity Budgeting> Periodic> Generate budget plan from demand forecast (or Generate 
budget plan from supply forecast) filtering on the forecast Model and selecting the 
ledger budget model, which should receive forecast figures. 
6.2.4 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 6.1 – Forecast Settings 
You need a sales forecast for items, which you have set up in previous exercises – 
the merchandise item of exercise 3.5 and the finished item of exercise 5.2. Your 
forecast should be in a scenario which is separate from other forecasting scenarios. 
In order to meet this requirement, create a new forecast model F-## (## = your user 
ID) without applying submodels. Then create a new forecast plan Y-##. Assign 
your forecast model to this forecast plan and make sure demand forecasts are 
included in this plan. The number sequences required can be similar to settings in 
existing forecast plans. 
Exercise 6.2 – Demand Forecast 
For the next quarter, you expect the customer of exercise 4.1 to order 200 units of 
the merchandise item and 100 units of the finished item on the first day of each 
month. 
Enter these figures in a demand forecast using the forecast model of exercise 6.1. 
Once you have finished, run forecast planning for your forecast plan and check the 
results afterwards. 

6.3  Master Planning 
245 
6.3 
Master Planning 
Master planning in Dynamics AX covers the short-term calculation of material and 
capacity requirements. It is the basis for the daily work in purchasing and 
production management. 
The calculation in master planning includes data referring to released products and 
resources in all areas of Dynamics AX. Depending on the setup, these data include 
sales orders, purchase orders, production orders, on-hand inventory, forecast 
plans, and master data (released products, resources). 
The result of master planning are planned orders for purchasing, production, 
Kanbans, and inventory transfer. Action messages and information on calculated 
delays support adjusting existing orders. 
6.3.1 
Basics of Master Planning 
Item transactions, sales orders, purchase orders, production orders, and the on-
hand quantity are an essential basis for master planning. In addition, master 
planning can include sales quotations, requests for quotation, approved purchase 
requisitions, and forecasts. You can adjust the demand resulting from forecasts and 
sales quotations by applying a probability percentage or a reduction principle. 
 
Figure 6-6: 
Elements of master planning 
Like in forecasting, you can maintain multiple parallel scenarios in master 
planning. A scenario is represented by a master plan, which contains the particular 
settings for the scenario. These settings include the elements included in master 
planning and the calculation principles for planned orders. 

246 
6  Operations Planning 
6.3.1.1 Master Planning Strategies 
Master planning usually is a batch job, which runs every night calculating the net 
requirements for all items. The result of this calculation is available in a scenario 
called “static master plan”. The static plan is the master plan to be used in 
purchasing and production control for scheduling orders. It is the default plan 
when accessing planned order forms. 
Apart from the master plan used for purchase and production scheduling, the sales 
department needs a plan to run simulations determining possible delivery dates in 
sales orders and quotations. This simulation requires executing master planning 
only for a particular item. The result of this simulation is available in a scenario 
called “dynamic master plan”. 
Based on both requirements, the master planning parameters provide the option to 
choose between two different strategies: 
 One plan strategy – One common plan for scheduling and simulations 
 Two plan strategy – Separate plans for scheduling and simulations 
If selecting the same master plan for the static and the dynamic master plan in the 
master planning parameters, you run a one master plan strategy. Planned orders of 
current master planning simulations in the sales department are updating the static 
plan, which is used in purchasing and production control. Depending on the 
requirements of your company, this strategy may fit to your business. 
If you want to apply a two master plan strategy, select a different master plan for 
the static and the dynamic plan. When running the batch job for global master 
planning in the night, you probably want to copy the static plan into the dynamic 
plan in order to base simulations on the current static plan. 
In this case, simulation in sales starts with the same data basis as purchasing and 
production scheduling in the morning. Simulation throughout the day does not 
change planned orders in the static plan, thereby avoiding problems in purchasing 
and production control caused by planned orders changing every moment. 
6.3.1.2 Customer Order Decoupling Point 
Depending on the structure of your products, there are two key supply policies in 
production control for fulfilling the customer demand: 
 Make-to-Stock – Produce based on sales forecasts and historical demand 
 Make-to-Order – Produce based on confirmed sales orders 
In addition, there are hybrid supply strategies applying a make-to-stock strategy 
for purchased or semi-finished items with a long lead time and a make-to-order 
strategy for finished products. If applying a hybrid strategy, the customer order 
decoupling point (push/pull point) determines the level in the product structure, to 
which the items are built to stock. 

6.3  Master Planning 
247 
Dynamics AX supports all of these strategies by choosing appropriate coverage 
groups (see section 6.3.3). In case of a hybrid supply strategy, you can enter 
forecasts at semi-finished product level (which is the customer order decoupling 
point for these items). Reduction settings in master plans determine how master 
planning offsets forecasted demand with actual sales orders. Since forecasts on 
semi-finished products are not directly offset by sales orders, you should choose to 
include all inventory transactions – including BOM line demand from production 
orders – in the coverage groups of applicable semi-finished items in order to 
comply with this situation. In the coverage group form, the lookup field Reduce 
forecast by contains the required option for this purpose. 
6.3.1.3 Master Planning and Planned Orders 
Master planning generates planned purchase orders, planned production orders, 
planned Kanbans, and planned inventory transfer orders based on item demand 
and settings for master planning. Depending on the scheduling principle (see 
section 6.3.4), master planning deletes existing planned orders which are not in the 
status “Approved”. 
You can check and edit the planned orders in the planned orders form before 
transferring them to actual purchase orders, production orders, Kanbans, and 
inventory transfer orders. 
6.3.2 
Master Planning Setup 
Before executing master planning, you have to finish the setup in Dynamics AX. 
6.3.2.1 Master Plans 
A master plan is a scenario, which contains the supply and demand calculation 
independently from the scenarios in other master plans. Depending on the 
planning strategy, one master plan or two master plans apply. If you need more 
simulation scenarios, set up additional master plans. 
You can access the master plans in the menu item Master planning> Setup> Plans> 
Master plans. Sliders on the tab General determine whether to include following 
items in the particular master plan: 
 Current inventory (on-hand inventory) 
 Inventory transactions (open orders) 
 Sales quotations (reduced by an optional probability percentage) 
 Approved purchase requisitions (only for requisitions with the requisition 
purpose “Replenishment”, which has to be enabled in the purchasing policy) 
 Shelf life dates (for batch-controlled item) 
 Continuity plans (from retail) 
 Requests for quotation (entered in purchasing) 
 Forecasts (supply and demand forecasts) 

248 
6  Operations Planning 
If you want to include forecasts in master planning, select the appropriate forecast 
plan in the lookup Forecast model of the master plan. In order to avoid excessive 
demand resulting from adding forecasts for a period to actual orders in the same 
period, you should offset the forecast by the current orders in this case. The lookup 
field Reduction principle in this case determines the way of reducing forecast data. If 
the selected principle refers to a Reduction key, you have to select a reduction key 
on the tab Other in the applicable coverage groups. 
 
Figure 6-7: 
Editing a master plan in the master plans form 
The Scheduling method in the master plan controls whether to run operations 
scheduling or job scheduling (compare section 5.4.3) for planned production 
orders. Among other settings for scheduling planned production orders, there is 
the option to apply finite capacity. 
The tab Time fences in days on the master plans form contains settings for overriding 
the time fences specified in the coverage group or in the item coverage. 
On the tab Calculated delays, specify whether master planning may set the 
requirement date in the different types of planned orders to a date, which is after 
the actual requirement date, if it is not possible to meet the actual requirement date 
because of applicable lead times. This setting prevents impossible dates like a 
delivery date before today. 

6.3  Master Planning 
249 
On the tab Action message, select for example if you want proposals to postpone 
planned purchase orders to a later date, if it is not necessary to receive the item as 
early as specified in the planned order date. 
6.3.2.2 Master Planning Parameters 
General parameters for master planning are specified in the form Master planning> 
Setup> Master planning parameters. A core setting controls the planning strategy: If 
applying a one master plan strategy, enter the same master plan in the field for the 
Current static master plan and the Current dynamic master plan.  
If applying a two master plan strategy, select two different master plans. 
Optionally set the slider Copy… in this case to “Yes”, which overrides the data in 
the dynamic plan with the static plan when executing master planning. 
6.3.2.3 Warehouse Settings 
If master planning should not include the on-hand quantity in specific warehouses 
– e.g. a consignment stock managed by the customer – set the slider Manual for the 
warehouse (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory breakdown> Warehouses, tab 
Master planning) to “Yes”. 
The warehouse form also contains a setting, whether the warehouse should be 
refilled from another warehouse (main warehouse). If selected, master planning 
generates item transfer proposals. As a prerequisite, the item has to contain a 
storage dimension group in which the checkbox Coverage plan by dimension is 
selected for the dimension “Warehouse”. 
6.3.3 
Item Coverage and Item Settings 
Coverage groups and settings on the released product control the calculation of lot 
sizes and delivery dates of planned orders generated by master planning. 
6.3.3.1 Coverage Principle 
The coverage principle, specified through the Coverage code in the coverage groups, 
is a main setting for item coverage. It controls, how requirements are summarized 
into a planned order. 
 
Figure 6-8: 
Coverage principles in Dynamics AX 
Dynamics AX includes four options for the coverage principle (see Figure 6-8): 

250 
6  Operations Planning 
 Period – Summarizing requirements within the coverage period (specified in 
the coverage group) 
 Requirement – Planned order per requirement (“Make-to-Order”) 
 Min./Max. – Replenishing to the maximum quantity when inventory drops 
below the minimum quantity 
 Manual – Planned orders are not generated in master planning 
Master planning generates a planned order, if the calculated inventory at a date is 
below the minimum quantity (or below zero, if a minimum quantity is not entered 
in the item coverage of the released product). 
6.3.3.2 Managing Coverage Groups 
The coverage group (Master planning> Setup> Coverage> Coverage groups) determines 
the coverage principle and further settings for lot size and delivery date 
calculation. In order to access coverage group form, choose the menu item. The 
main setting in a coverage group is the Coverage code, which specifies the coverage 
principle. In case the Coverage code is “Period”, the Coverage period below this field 
determines the number of days for combining demand in one planned order. 
 
Figure 6-9: 
Selecting the coverage code in a coverage group 
The Positive days on the tab General sets the time fence for including the on-hand 
quantity in the calculation demand and should correspond to the lead time or the 
coverage time fence (depending on the order history). 
The Coverage time fence and the time fence fields on the tab Other determine the 
periods included in master planning. Depending on the planning strategy and the 
lead time of the items, the number of days entered in the time fence fields should 
cover an applicable number of weeks or months. 

6.3  Master Planning 
251 
The Firming time fence on the tab Other determines the period, for which master 
planning does not create a planned order but an actual purchase order or 
production order. If no main supplier is entered in the item record or specified 
through an applicable trade agreement for the purchased item, master planning 
still generates a planned purchase order (for selecting the vendor). As a 
prerequisite using vendors from trade agreements in master planning, the slider 
Find trade agreement in the master planning parameters has to be set to “Yes”. 
6.3.3.3 Forecast Plan Calculation and Reduction Keys 
On tab Other of the coverage groups, the Forecast plan time fence and forecast 
reduction settings determine the calculation of forecast in master planning. 
Reduction keys (Master planning> Setup> Coverage> Reduction keys) control the 
periods and percentages applied for reducing forecast figures in the course of time. 
As a prerequisite for applying the reduction key selected in the coverage group, 
the Reduction principle in the master plan has to refer to reduction keys. 
The reduction principle in the master plan controls the way forecasted figures are 
reduced when considering them as demand. If entering forecasts for semi-finished 
items (hybrid supply strategy with customer order decoupling point, see section 
6.3.1), reduction for the semi-finished product should not only include direct sales 
orders, but also demand derived from the finished product. Choosing the option 
“All transactions” in the lookup Reduce forecast by of the coverage group offsets 
forecasts by all issue transactions (including production BOM line demand). 
6.3.3.4 Settings for Calculated Delays and Action Messages 
Action messages, which are activated on the tab Action of the coverage group form, 
are messages from master planning to adjust actual or planned purchase and 
production orders. The aim of action messages is to support adjustments, which 
may not be done automatically (like postponing a purchase order, which is too 
early). They show proposals for optimizing quantities and dates of item receipt. 
Item availability is granted, no matter if you disregard action messages. 
Unlike action messages, calculated delays show actual problems of item 
availability. A calculated delay is created, if the lead time of required items at all 
BOM levels results in a necessary supply before today, therefore causing delays in 
order fulfillment. 
If activating both, calculated delays and action messages, usually select the option 
“Delayed date” in the lookup field Basis date on the tab Action. With this setting, 
action messages are based on the earliest possible date and not the original – 
impossible – requirement date. 
6.3.3.5 Assigning Coverage Groups to Items 
There are three levels for assigning a coverage group to an item: 

252 
6  Operations Planning 
 Item coverage – Button PLAN/Coverage/Item coverage in the released product 
 Released product – Tab Plan in the released product  
 Master planning parameters – General coverage group on the tab General 
The coverage group specifies the method for calculating lot sizes. If there is a big 
difference in the lead time or in the cost price of your items, you want to group the 
items by entering different coverage groups in the released products based on the 
inventory value and the lead time. 
6.3.3.6 Dimension Group Settings 
Settings in the storage and tracking dimension groups control the inventory 
dimensions covered separately in coverage calculation. The dimension groups of 
an item therefore determine the available dimensions in the item coverage and the 
dimensions calculated separately in master planning (e.g. calculating supply and 
demand per warehouse). 
You can edit dimension groups in the menu folder Product information management> 
Setup> Dimension and variant groups (see section 7.2.2). In the dimension groups, 
select the checkbox Coverage plan by dimension for storage and tracking dimensions 
which should be calculated separately in master planning. The dimension Site and 
the product dimensions are always calculated separately. 
6.3.3.7 Item Coverage 
Apart from the coverage group and the dimension groups, the item coverage is 
another important setting for master planning in the released product. 
Clicking the button PLAN/Coverage/Item coverage on the action pane of the released 
product displays the item coverage form, where you can insert records specifying a 
minimum and – if applicable – a maximum quantity for the item. Depending on 
the dimension groups of the item and applicable dimension group settings (see 
above), you have to enter the item coverage per site, warehouse, or other 
dimensions like color or configuration. 
The item coverage form contains settings for the item at dimension level, which 
may override settings from the item or the coverage group. You can, for example, 
select a Coverage group for a particular warehouse which is different from the 
coverage group in the released product. You can also select a specific main vendor 
and planned order type – for example purchasing an item from an external vendor 
in one specific warehouse, but producing it internally in the other warehouses. 
If entering a minimum quantity, the lookup field Minimum key on the tab General 
provides the option to specify a seasonal trend for the minimum quantity. The 
results of the minimum key show on the tab Min./Max. of the item coverage form. 
You can set up minimum keys in the form Master planning> Setup> Coverage> 
Minimum/Maximum keys with a percentage per period on the tab Periods. 

6.3  Master Planning 
253 
6.3.4 
Master Planning and Planned Orders 
Based on item requirements and coverage settings, master planning generates 
planned orders for purchasing, production and inventory transfer. There are two 
different types of master planning: 
 Local master planning – Availability check, e.g. in a sales order line 
 Global master planning – Regular master planning for all items 
6.3.4.1 Global Master Planning 
Global master planning is the basis for creating orders in purchasing and 
production in daily business. Depending on the company size and the item 
structure, master planning involves extensive calculations which is why it usually 
runs as a batch job in the nighttime. 
In order to start global master planning, access the menu item Master planning> 
Run> Master planning. In the Master planning dialog, select the applicable Master 
plan (for global master planning usually the current static master plan). It is not 
necessary to execute master planning separately with the dynamic master plan, if 
the slider Automatic copy in the master planning parameters is set to “Yes”. 
The lookup field Planning method in the master planning dialog determines the 
calculation principle showing following options: 
 Regeneration – Complete calculation, deleting all not approved planned orders  
 Net change – Generating action messages and calculated delays for all 
requirements, but planned orders only for new requirements 
 Net change minimized – Like net change, limiting new messages to new 
requirements 
If selecting the current static plan, “Regeneration” is the only available planning 
method. For dynamic plans you should also choose “Regeneration” if there are 
changes in coverage settings (like the minimum quantity for an item). 
6.3.4.2 Local Master Planning 
Unlike global master planning, local master planning aims to check the item 
availability and possible delivery dates limited to a particular item. You can 
execute local master planning in the net requirements form, which you can access 
by clicking the button PLAN/Requirements/Net requirements in the action pane of the 
released product form or by clicking the button Product and supply/Net requirements 
in the toolbar of order lines. 
The net requirements form shows the result of the last master planning cycle for 
the dynamic master plan. If a one master plan strategy is in place, the lines in the 
net requirements are identical to those used in purchasing and production control. 
Clicking the button Update/Master planning in the action pane of the net 
requirements form starts master planning. Local master planning updates the 

254 
6  Operations Planning 
current dynamic master plan for the selected item and its components. When 
viewing the results, you have to take into account that not all dependencies of 
other items are covered by the calculation, in particular regarding resource 
capacity requirements. 
6.3.4.3 Working with Action Messages and Calculated Delays 
If calculated delays (showing availability problems) and action messages (for 
optimization requiring manual decisions) are activated in the applicable coverage 
groups, master planning generates corresponding messages. They show in the 
corresponding columns of the net requirements form. 
In addition, the list page Master planning> Master planning> Calculated delays 
contains an overview of all calculated delays in the static or dynamic plan selected 
in the lookup field Plan. Clicking the button CALCULATED DELAYS/Open/ 
Reference in the action pane of the calculated delays form opens the related order, 
which you can adjust as applicable. 
An overview of all action messages is available in the list page Master planning> 
Master planning> Actions> Actions. After selecting the appropriate plan in the 
lookup field Plan you can access related orders by clicking the order number 
shown as link in the column Number. The action pane of the actions form contains 
the button Apply action for immediately executing the action message of a 
particular line – e.g. deleting a purchase order. The button Action graph in the 
actions form provides access to a chart showing dependencies between action 
messages. 
6.3.4.4 Planned Orders 
Planned orders generated by master planning are shown in the list page Master 
planning> Master planning> Planned orders and in Master planning workspace (list 
Urgent and other lists). The lookup field Plan in the list page and the workspace 
provides the option to select the static, the dynamic, or any other master plan. 
 
Figure 6-10: Working with planned orders 

6.3  Master Planning 
255 
The planned order form in the master planning menu and the Master planning 
workspace show planned orders for purchasing, for production, and for inventory 
transfers (indicated by the column Reference). A filtered view of planned orders is 
available in the relevant modules – e.g. planned purchase orders in procurement 
and sourcing. 
If the sliders Add the calculated delay to the requirement date on the tab Calculated 
delays in the selected master plan are set to “Yes”, the Delivery date is adjusted to 
the earliest possible date and the required date shows in the column Requested date. 
Apart from the delivery date and the requirement quantity, the planned orders 
page displays action messages and calculated delays in separate columns. The 
planned order detail form, which opens by clicking the order number shown as 
link in the column Number, shows details on action message and calculated delays 
on the tabs Action and Delays. The tab Pegging in the detail form shows the 
requirements covered by the particular planned order – e.g. sales orders, BOM 
lines of production orders, demand forecasts, or safety stock. 
6.3.4.5 Firming an Order 
You can edit the delivery date and the quantity on the tab Planned supply of the 
planned orders detail form. For planned purchase orders, make sure that a vendor 
number is entered in the lookup field Vendor. 
If your company applies status management for planned orders, change the status 
to “Approved” (or to the status “Completed” if the planned order should not be 
firmed) by clicking the button Approve or PLANNED ORDER/Process/Change status 
in the action pane. Subsequent master planning does not change or delete 
approved planned orders. 
After selecting one or more orders in the planned orders list page, click the button 
Firm in the action pane to generate corresponding purchase orders, production 
orders, or transfer orders. If you want to create a request for quotation (see section 
3.8.3) 
instead 
of 
a 
purchase 
order, 
click 
the 
button 
PLANNED 
ORDER/Maintain/Change to/Request for quotation. 
When firming a planned production order, the Requested production status on the 
tab Other of the applicable coverage group determines the initial status of the 
production order. When firming a planned purchase order, the purchase order 
always has the approval status “Approved” (independently from change 
management settings). 
The firming history (Master planning> Inquiries and reports> Master planning> 
Firming history) displays a log of firming activities. 
Apart from the planned order list page, the Master planning workspace also 
provides the option to edit and firm planned orders. 

256 
6  Operations Planning 
6.3.4.6 Net Requirements and Explosion 
In order to get an overview of the net requirements related to a planned order, 
click the button VIEW/Requirements/Requirement profile in the action pane of the 
planned order form. The requirement profile shows the net requirements form, 
which you can also access from the released product form or from the order lines. 
 
Figure 6-11: Analyzing the availability within the BOM structure in the explosion form 
The button VIEW/Requirements/Explosion in the action pane of the planned order 
form provides access to another inquiry, the explosion form. This form, which you 
can also access from the released product or from the order lines in parallel to the 
net requirements, shows the item availability including components at all BOM 
levels. Clicking the button Setup in the action pane of the explosion form provides 
the option to change display settings. 
The button Explosion view in the action pane determines the direction of explosion: 
If selecting “Down”, the form shows semi-finished items and components of the 
selected item. If selecting “Up”, the form shows a where-used analysis. 
When updating the calculation by clicking the button Update in the explosion form, 
a dialog displays where you can set the slider Enable trace to “Yes”. With this 
setting, Dynamics AX creates a log of the impacts and results of master planning, 
which you can view on the tab Explanation in the explosion form afterwards.

6.3.4.7 Supply schedule 
The supply schedule form shows a comprehensive view of the future supply and 
demand – similar to the net requirements, but summarized per period and 
transaction type. As a prerequisite for using the supply schedule, you have to set 
up period types (Organization administration> Setup> Calendars> Period templates), 
which provide the option to flexibly set up the periods (configure periods on the 
tab Periods there). 
When accessing the supply schedule from the master planning menu (Master 
planning> Master planning> Supply schedule), a dialog shows where you have to 
specify a filter on the Plan (for showing planned orders), Period template, Item or 
Item allocation key, and inventory dimensions (optional). Apart from this menu 
item, you can access the supply schedule from multiple pages by clicking a button 
in the action pane or toolbar (e.g. the button PLAN/View/Supply schedule in the 
released product or the button Inquiries/Supply schedule in the net requirements). 
 
Figure 6-12: Viewing supply details in the supply schedule 
In the supply schedule form, you can view supply and demand details on a tab at 
the bottom after selecting a cell in a period column and clicking the button Expand/ 
Collapse in the toolbar. Clicking the button Master planning starts local master 
planning, and the button New provides the option to create planned or actual 
orders directly from the supply schedule.

Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 6.3 – Min./Max. Principle 
You want to apply a Min./Max. coverage principle to your finished item of exercise 
5.2. Select an appropriate coverage group in the released product form and enter a 
minimum quantity of 500 units and a maximum quantity of 1000 units in the item 
coverage of the item. 
Once you have finished, run master planning in the net requirements form and 
check the result. In a second step, change the minimum quantity to one unit. After 
executing master planning a second time, can you explain the result? 
Exercise 6.4 – Period Principle 
You want to apply a coverage principle summarizing requirements per period for 
your finished item of exercise 5.2 now. Choose an appropriate coverage group in 
the item record and delete the Min./Max. record in the item coverage. 
Your customer of exercise 4.1 orders 100 units of the finished item. Enter a sales 
order for this requirement without posting a packing slip or invoice. Execute 
master planning in the net requirements form then. After checking the results, 
enter a second order of your customer containing 150 units of the finished item 
with the same delivery date as the first order. 
Start master planning a second time and check the result again. 
Exercise 6.5 – Planned Purchase Order 
A minimum inventory quantity of 100 units (more than the available quantity) on 
the main warehouse is required for the first item entered in exercise 5.1. After 
entering this minimum quantity, open the net requirements form for the item and 
update the master plan. What is the result of this master planning update? 
Open the planned purchase order form in the procurement and sourcing menu. If 
required, switch to the dynamic master plan which has been used when updating 
the net requirements. Select the planned order referring to your item and transfer it 
to a purchase order.

Inventory and Product Management 
The primary responsibility of inventory management is to control the warehouse 
in terms of quantity and value. In order to perform this task in Dynamics AX, 
changes of the inventory quantity have to be registered and posted as transactions. 
The current quantity in inventory always is the total of item issue and receipt 
transactions. Most of the transactions are not a result of business processes within 
inventory management, but created automatically from other areas. Dynamics AX 
for example posts a receipt transaction in inventory when posting a product receipt 
in procurement and sourcing. 
7.1 
Principles of Inventory Transactions 
Before we start to go into details, the lines below show the principles of 
transactions in inventory management. 
7.1.1 
Basic Approach 
The most important master data in inventory management are the product records 
of inventoried items. Inventory management then controls the inventory per 
product (item number). Depending on the dimension groups assigned to the 
particular product, the quantity and value of the item is controlled at the more 
detailed level of inventory dimensions. These dimensions include storage 
dimensions (e.g. warehouse or location), tracking dimensions (e.g. serial numbers), 
and product dimensions (e.g. configurations). 
7.1.1.1 Types of Transactions 
In order to change the on-hand quantity, you need to post an item transaction. 
Depending on the direction, the transaction belongs to one of the following types: 
 Item receipt – Inbound transaction 
 Item issue – Outbound transaction 
 Item transfer – Between warehouses, locations, or tracking dimensions 
Item receipts increase the on-hand quantity. They include product receipts in 
purchasing, customer returns in sales, product receipts in production (reported as 
finished), positive adjustments in counting, and manual journals in inventory. 
Item issues on the other hand include vendor returns in purchasing, packing slips 
in sales, picking lists in production, negative adjustments in counting, and manual 
journals in inventory. 
Inventory transfers include transfer orders and transfer journals. Transfer orders 
support the transfer of items from one warehouse to another, providing the option

7  Inventory and Product Management 
to post and print picking lists. Unlike transfer orders, transfer journals are not only 
available for transfers from one warehouse to another, but also for changing other 
dimension values (e.g. adjusting a serial number). 
Although registering a transfer in a transfer journal only requires entering a single 
line, the posted transaction shows two lines. A transfer between warehouses for 
example creates one transaction line for the item issue from the shipping 
warehouse and one for the item receipt at the receiving warehouse. 
7.1.1.2 Transactions from Other Areas 
Most of the inventory transactions do not originate from inventory management, 
but derive from other areas in Dynamics AX. The transaction origin in the other 
module (e.g. a purchase order/product receipt) has to contain all data required for 
the inventory transaction – including warehouse, quantity, and cost price. 
When viewing a posted inventory transaction, it shows the reference to the 
transaction origin including voucher number and date. 
7.1.1.3 Inventory Quantity and Value 
In order to grant an accurate inventory valuation, Dynamics AX distinguishes 
between the physical transaction (determining the on-hand quantity) and the 
financial transaction (determining the financial value). 
For illustration purposes, Figure 7-1 shows the physical and the financial part of an 
inventory transaction related to a purchase order line. 
 
Figure 7-1: 
Physical and financial transaction in inventory for a purchase order line 
The physical transaction in Dynamics AX causes a change of the on-hand quantity 
in inventory. An example for posting a physical transaction is the product receipt 
in purchasing. 
In terms of inventory quantity, the transaction is already completed when posting 
the product receipt. But inventory valuation only receives a preliminary cost price. 
The value of the product receipt shows in the field Physical cost amount separately 
from the field Cost amount, which contains the financial inventory value. 
The second step in processing an inventory transaction is the financial transaction, 
which contains the cost amount referring to the invoiced quantity. An example for 
posting a financial transaction is the purchase order invoice. 

7.1  Principles of Inventory Transactions 
261 
Posting the vendor invoice reverses the related preliminary posting of the product 
receipt (physical amount) and posts the cost amount of the invoice. Quantity and 
amount of the invoice are subsequently included in the financial inventory value. 
7.1.1.4 Posting Inventory Transactions 
The differentiation between the physical and the financial transaction applies to 
every inventory transaction, no matter in which module it is generated. But the 
way of posting a transaction is depending on the origin. 
For receipt transactions in purchase orders, posting the product receipt generates 
the physical transaction, and posting the vendor invoice the financial transaction. 
In production, reporting the produced item as finished posts the physical 
transaction. The financial transaction is posted by ending the production order. 
For issue transactions in sales orders, the packing slip posts the physical and the 
invoice the financial transaction (similar to purchasing). In production, posting the 
picking list posts the physical transaction for BOM components. The financial 
transaction for BOM components is posted – in parallel to the financial transaction 
for receiving the finished item – by ending the production order. 
Unlike the other transactions, journals in inventory management do not post the 
physical and the financial transaction in two separate steps, but in parallel. 
7.1.1.5 Inventory Closing 
The final financial value for receipt transactions is specified when posting the 
related invoice (apart from later manual adjustments). But for issue transactions, 
the financial inventory value often is not known and therefore not final when 
posting the invoice. You can, for example, receive the purchase invoice with the 
final cost price of an item after posting the sales invoice for the item. If the 
purchase invoice shows a price which is different from the preliminary amount 
posted with the product receipt, the final profitability shown in the sales 
transaction will change (except when using a standard cost price valuation). 
Except for items referring to a standard cost price or a moving average valuation, 
you need to re-evaluate issue transactions through inventory closing. The main 
purpose of inventory closing, usually a month-end procedure, is to recalculate the 
financial value of issue transactions based on the final value of receipt transactions. 
7.1.1.6 Ledger Integration 
Inventory journals post to ledger accounts depending on applicable settings (see 
section 9.4) in the same way as inventory transactions generated in other modules. 

262 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.1.2 
At a Glance: Inventory Journal Transactions 
Inventory journals are used to manually change the on-hand quantity of items, 
independently from orders in purchasing, sales, or production. The example below 
shows a manual item receipt in an inventory adjustment journal. In regular 
business, such transactions are an exception, since problems or missing end-to-end 
business processes in most cases are the reason for receiving an item not related to 
a purchase order, production order, or customer return order. 
When accessing the menu item for inventory adjustment (Inventory management> 
Journal entries> Items> Inventory adjustment), the list page shows all open adjustment 
journals which are not posted yet. Applying an appropriate filter on the column 
Posted (you can use the filter pane, the grid column filter, and the advanced filter) 
provides the option to view also posted journals. The column Lines shows the 
number of lines in the journal. If somebody is currently working in a particular 
journal, the journal shows a user icon in the column In use. If you want to access 
the details of a journal, click the journal ID shown as link in the grid. 
In order to register a new transaction, insert a record in the journal header list page 
by clicking the button New in the action pane or by pressing the shortcut Alt+N. In 
the Create dialog, select a journal name in the field Name and optionally enter a Site 
and Warehouse as default for the lines. If you want to support later analysis, enter a 
short text explaining the transaction in the field Description. The journal number in 
the field Journal derives from the applicable number sequence. 
 
Figure 7-2: 
Creating a new journal in the inventory adjustment journal form 
After clicking the button OK in the dialog, Dynamics AX creates the journal header 
and switches to the journal detail form. Clicking the button Header below the action 

7.1  Principles of Inventory Transactions 
263 
pane in the detail form switches to the header view, where you can view the 
complete journal header. 
In the lines view, insert a line on the tab Journal lines and select the item number 
before entering site, warehouse, and other inventory dimensions as specified in the 
applicable dimension groups. In order to control the dimension columns displayed 
in the lines, click the button Inventory/Display dimensions in the toolbar of the 
Journal lines tab after saving a line. The Line details tab provides the option to enter 
further details. 
If entering a positive quantity, the transaction is an item receipt. A negative 
quantity creates an item issue. Default values for warehouse, quantity, and cost 
price derive from the released product. The default for the quantity is 1.00, if the 
released product (default order settings or site-specific order settings) does not 
contain a default inventory quantity. 
 
Figure 7-3: 
Registering a journal line 
Unlike transactions in purchasing, inventory journal transactions are not split into 
a physical product receipt and a corresponding financial transaction from an 
invoice. Inventory journals post the physical and the financial transaction at the 
same time, which is why you should make sure that journal lines with a positive 
quantity (item receipts) contain a correct cost price when posting the journal. 
In order to post the journal after entering the last journal line, click the button Post 
in the action pane of the journal list page or detail form. 
Before posting, you can optionally click the button Validate for checking potential 
problems. But validation does not check all possible problems, which is why you 
might sometimes receive an error message when posting a journal, even if the 
validation does not show a problem. 
 

264 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.2 
Product Information Management 
Since all business processes related to inventory require inventoried products, 
product data are the core element of master data in supply chain management. 
The data structure of products in Dynamics AX includes two levels – the shared 
products with basic item data common to all companies, and the released products 
with company-specific item data. 
The product table contains all physical items – raw materials, components, semi-
finished products, and finished products. In addition, product records also include 
non-inventoried items like service or phantom items. These items do not exist 
physically, but you can use them in order management or in bills of materials. 
In some areas of the application, the label “Item” refers to released products. 
7.2.1 
General Product Data 
Product data have already been discussed in section 3.3, 4.3, 5.2.1 and 6.3.3 with 
regard to purchasing, sales, production, and master planning. This section does not 
include the topics covered there. Apart from general features of the product and 
released product form, the focus in this section is on item data in inventory and on 
inventory valuation. 
7.2.1.1 Structure of Product Data 
The shared products in Dynamics AX include all products required in any 
company of a common enterprise. In order to be available in a company, the 
shared product has to be released to the particular company. You do not need to 
release a product to all companies in parallel, it is also possible to release a product 
to some companies earlier and to other companies later. 
 
Figure 7-4: 
Main control groups of a product 
Data in the shared products are common to all companies to which a product has 
been released. These data include the product number, the product type and 
subtype (non-inventoried, inventoried, or configurable item), and the dimension 

7.2  Product Information Management 
265 
groups. If applicable, you can leave the dimension groups in the shared product 
empty and enter them at company level in the released products. 
Most product details are specified at company level in the released product form. 
Required fields there include the dimension groups (if not specified in the shared 
product), the item group, the item model group, and the unit of measure. 
7.2.1.2 Creating a Shared Product 
Depending on the requirements, there are two ways for creating a new product 
(compare section 3.3.2): 
 Start with the shared product – Create a shared product and release it 
 Start with the released product – Create a product in the released product 
form, automatically generating a shared product in the background 
In order to view the list of all existing shared products, open the form Product 
information management> Products> All products and product masters. The list pages 
Products (for items without configurations or variants) and Product masters (for 
configurable items) show a filtered view of all shared products. 
If you want to create an item in the shared product form, click the button New in 
the action pane. You can subsequently release the product to one or more 
companies by clicking the button Release products in the action pane and selecting 
applicable companies in the Release products wizard. 
The menu item Product information management> Products> Released products 
provides access to the released products. Alternatively, you can access a released 
product directly from the shared product by clicking the link in the Item number 
field on the right-hand side of the FactBox Released to companies and then clicking 
the link in the field Item number of the product information dialog. 
The Released product maintenance workspace is another place, from which you can to 
access released products. In the tabbed list pane there, the list Recently released 
shows the items released within the last days (specify the date range by clicking 
the button Configure my workspace) and the validation result (missing field values). 
Instead of creating a new product in the shared product form, you can also create a 
product in the released product form by clicking the button New in the action pane. 
The New released product dialog then includes data for the shared and for the 
corresponding released product (containing all mandatory fields of the released 
product). If there are templates for released products, the additional field Apply 
template for selecting an appropriate template shows in the dialog. 
You can also apply templates (see section 2.3.2) for released products at a later 
time. In order to apply a template later, click the button PRODUCT/Maintain/Apply 
template in the action pane of the released product. The template then overrides 
data in the released product with data from the template. If you want to create a 
template in the released product form, click the button PRODUCT/New/Template. 

266 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.2.1.3 Product Number and Name 
The Product number, which identifies the shared product, has to be unique across 
companies. It is assigned automatically to new products, if the number sequence 
for products numbers (Product information management> Setup> Product information 
management parameters, tab Number sequences) does not specify a manual 
assignment. 
The Item number identifying items at released product level is identical to the 
shared product number, if there is no other setting in the number sequence for 
item numbers (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory and warehouse management 
parameters, tab Number sequences) of the particular company. 
When creating a shared product, the default for the Search name derives from the 
Product name. You can update the search name in the shared product and enter a 
longer product description in the field Description. If there are different product 
names and descriptions in foreign languages, enter them after clicking the button 
PRODUCT/Languages/Translations in the action pane of the shared product form. 
Product name and description are only editable at shared product level. The Search 
name in the shared product is a default for the released products, which you can 
override at released product level. 
7.2.1.4 Product Type and Subtype 
The Product type controls, if a product is an inventoried item. Whereas the product 
type “Item” characterizes a regular item, the product type “Service” specifies an 
item without inventory control in any company. 
The Product subtype controls item configuration. Whereas the product subtype 
“Product” applies to a regular standard item, the product subtype “Product 
master” characterizes a base item for assigned product variants. 
7.2.1.5 Product Master 
If a product refers to the product subtype “Product master”, the product number 
alone does not uniquely identify the item in inventory. In transactions with this 
item, you have to enter the product variant which distinguishes the different sizes, 
colors, styles, or configurations of the product. 
When creating a product master (selecting the product subtype “Product master”), 
the Product dimension group – one of the three dimension groups described in 
section 7.2.2 below – shows in the Create product dialog. The product dimension 
group is selected at shared product level, determining which of the dimensions 
Configuration, Size, Color and/or Style apply. 
The Configuration technology, which is the second mandatory field when creating a 
product master, determines the way of creating product variants. 

7.2  Product Information Management 
267 
If selecting the configuration technology “Predefined variant”, you can enter 
dimension values for product variants after clicking the button Product dimensions 
in the action pane of the shared product. The left pane of the Product dimensions 
form then shows the dimensions, which are applicable to the product according to 
the selected product dimension group. 
After entering product dimension values for applicable dimensions in the product 
dimensions form, you have to specify available variants (dimension value 
combinations) after clicking the button Product variants in the shared product. The 
button Variant suggestions in the product variants form facilitates creating new 
variants. In general, you want to create variants manually if the particular product 
is – for example – not available in all colors for each size. If a product only includes 
one active product dimension or if all dimension combinations are available, set 
the slider Generate variants automatically in the shared product detail form to “Yes” 
before starting to enter product dimension values. 
Before you can select a product variant in a transaction, you have to release it by 
clicking the button Release products in the action pane of the shared product. In the 
Release product wizard, you can choose the variants which should be released. 
Apart from releasing product variants in parallel to releasing the product master, 
you can also release variants separately at a later time. An alternative way for 
releasing variants is to create released product variants (based on shared product 
variants) manually in the released product variants form (access from the released 
product by clicking the button PRODUCT/Product master/Released product variants). 
If there are common variants for multiple products, you can use variant groups to 
populate the product dimensions. After creating a new variant group for sizes 
(Product information management> Setup> Dimensions and variant groups> Size groups), 
colors, or styles with the related dimension values, you can select the color group, 
size group, or style group as applicable in the shared product detail form. The 
dimension values of the variant group then are a default in the product dimensions 
of the shared product. 
7.2.1.6 Core Settings in Released Products 
Whereas the shared product form only contains a limited number of fields, the 
released product form includes a wide range of detail data for characterizing the 
particular item. 
Only a few fields in the released product are mandatory, including the unit of 
measure, the item group, the item model group (see section 7.2.3), and – either at 
shared product level or at released product level – the dimension groups (see 
section 7.2.2). The button PRODUCT/Maintain/Validate in the action pane of the 
released product provides the option to check if a released product contains all 
mandatory data. 

268 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
Other data in the released product like the item sales tax groups and the cost price 
(see section 7.3.3) are not mandatory, but depending on the specific requirements 
nevertheless of high importance. 
 
Figure 7-5: 
Managing an item in the released product form 
7.2.1.7 Units of Measure 
When releasing a new product, Dynamics AX applies the default unit of measure 
as specified in the inventory management parameters (field Unit on the tab General 
of the parameters). As long as there is no transaction for the item, it is possible to 
change the inventory unit of a released product. 
If an item requires different units of measure in purchasing, sales, and inventory, 
enter the appropriate units on the tabs Purchase, Sell and Manage inventory of the 
released product form. The unit in the released product is the default in 
transactions entered for the item, e.g. in a sales order line. In the transaction, you 
can override the unit if necessary. When choosing a different unit, there needs to 
be a unit conversion between the selected unit and the inventory unit. 
Units of measure are shared across companies. If you require a new unit of 
measure, you have to set it up in the Units form (Organization administration> 
Setup> Units> Units) before assigning it to a released product. The Unit class (e.g. 
“Quantity” or “Mass”) determines the area to which a unit of measure applies. In 
one unit per unit class, you can select the checkbox System unit which applies this 
unit to quantity fields without a related unit of measure. The net weight field in the 
released products is an example for such a quantity field, whereas order lines for 
example contain a field for the quantity and a field for the unit. 

7.2  Product Information Management 
269 
Clicking the button Unit conversions in the Units form provides access to the unit 
conversions. Conversion factors between units entered on the tab Standard 
conversion apply to all products. The tab Intra-class conversions provides the option 
to enter conversions per item number within a Unit class, the tab Inter-class 
conversions across unit classes (e.g. between the length and the quantity in pieces). 
7.2.1.8 Item Group 
The main purpose of item groups is to collect products, which post to a common 
main account in the general ledger. For this reason, you need to set up at least as 
many item groups as there are different stock and revenue accounts for inventory 
items in finance. You can find more details on the inventory posting setup in 
section 9.4.2. 
When releasing a product, you have to keep in mind that you should not change 
the item group on tab Manage costs of the released product after registering the first 
transaction. Dynamics AX displays a warning on possible issues with inventory 
reconciliation in finance if you do not carefully check the consequences of changing 
the group. But the warning does not prevent changing the item group, if necessary. 
Item groups do not only control ledger integration, they also are a filtering and 
sorting criteria in many reports. 
7.2.1.9 Non Inventoried Items and Services 
Apart from regular products, which you want to track in inventory, there are items 
– e.g. services or office supplies – which are not included in inventory. 
Dynamics AX provides two separate options to specify whether inventory control 
applies to a product: 
 Product type – Option “Item” or “Service” 
 Item model group – Checkbox Stocked product 
Depending on the combination of both settings, inventory control works different 
(see Table 7-1). 
Table 7-1: 
Options for the inventory control of products 
Product type
Item model group 
Item
Service
Stocked product 
Inventory transactions, 
inventory quantity 
Inventory transactions,

No transactions 
The product type “Service” is used for products, which do not apply inventory 
control in any company. But if assigned to an item model group for stocked 
products, products of this type generate inventory transactions. This setting is 
required for intangible items and services which are part of a BOM. 

270 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
When setting up items of the product type “Service”, you have to assign a specific 
item group and item model group for granting correct inventory valuation and 
ledger postings. 
Linking a released product to an item model group, which shows a cleared 
checkbox Stocked product, does not only avoid an inventory quantity but also 
prevents inventory transactions. Since the item model group is assigned to the 
released product, this setting makes it possible to deactivate inventory control for 
an item at company level. 
7.2.1.10 Number Groups 
When entering a batch or serial number in a transaction, the batches or serial 
numbers table (Inventory management> Inquiries and reports> Tracking dimensions) has 
to include this number. 
If you are in control of specifying the batch or serial numbers – for example if you 
produce the item – you can set up Dynamics AX to generate batch or serial 
numbers automatically through tracking number groups (Inventory management> 
Setup> Dimensions> Tracking number groups). On the tab General of the tracking 
number groups, specify the structure of the related numbers and select a Number 
sequence code if included in the structure (Number sequence No. set to “Yes”). Settings 
on the tab Activation determine which transactions actually generate numbers. 
In the released product form, the Tracking dimension group (see section 7.2.2 below) 
controls, if batch or serial numbers apply to an item. If this is the case, you can 
select a batch or serial number group on the tab Manage inventory of the released 
product to generate batch or serial numbers for the item automatically. 
7.2.1.11 Catch Weight Products 
A catch weight product (CW product) is an item with weight as primary unit of 
measure, and a secondary unit (catch weight unit) for a countable number (e.g. 
pieces) in parallel. The weight per unit varies, and as a result there is no fixed unit 
conversion between the weight unit and the catch weight unit. In the order lines of 
purchase orders, sales orders, or batch production orders, only the catch weight 
quantity (the number of pieces) is editable. When registering inventory 
transactions, both weight and catch weight quantity have to be entered in parallel. 
The catch weight functionality originates from process industries. Examples of 
catch weight products are animals (or parts of animals) in food industry requiring 
to show the counted number and the weight in parallel. Usually, catch weight only 
applies to items with batch and/or serial number control. 
In Dynamics AX, the catch weight functionality is generally available in inventory, 
purchasing and sales, where all applicable forms contain additional fields for the 
catch weight. Usage in production is limited to batch production orders, since only 
formulas – not regular bills of materials – can include catch weight items. Because 

7.2  Product Information Management 
271 
of its complexity, you should only use catch weight if you actually need to track 
weight and catch weight quantity independently from each other. 
In order to set up a catch weight item, set the slider Catch weight (CW product) to 
“Yes” when creating the shared product. Then click the button PRODUCT/Set up/ 
Unit conversions in the shared product and enter an Inter-class conversion between 
the inventory unit (weight) and the catch weight unit (pieces). The catch weight 
unit has to be a unit without decimals (Decimal precision zero in the unit). 
When releasing the product, the inventory unit of the item has to be a weight unit 
(the default unit in the inventory parameters usually is a weight unit in applicable 
companies). On the tab Manage inventory in the released product form, select the 
catch weight unit in the field CW unit and enter the Minimum quantity and the 
Maximum quantity in the fields below, determining the range for the allowed 
conversion factor (weight per unit). Like for other products, enter further required 
data including item model group, item group, and dimension groups as applicable. 
 
Figure 7-6: 
Entering catch weight settings in the released product 
When registering a purchase order line, enter the catch weight quantity (number of 
pieces) in the column CW quantity. The column Quantity, which is not editable for a 
catch weight item, shows the quantity according to the regular unit conversion. 
When receiving the item in the inventory registration form or in an item arrival 
journal (see section 3.5.3), you have to enter the CW quantity and the inventory 
quantity (default from the unit conversion) independently in parallel. 
CW quantity and the quantity in inventory unit have to be entered independently 
in all inventory transactions, including sales order picking and inventory journals. 
Inquiries of the current inventory show both, weight and catch weight quantity.

7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.2.1.12 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
New items which in product management refer to the browser-based interface 
including changes like a separate tab for variant settings in the released product. 
7.2.2 
Inventory Dimension Group 
Inventory dimensions control the breakdown of inventory quantity within released 
products. Through the use of dimensions, you can split the inventory quantity and 
the transactions to a more detailed level than the item number. 
7.2.2.1 Available Dimensions 
Inventory dimensions in Dynamics AX are divided into following groups: 
 Product dimensions – Configuration, size, color and style provide the option to 
subdivide an item based on product characteristics (only for product masters) 
 Storage dimensions – Site, warehouse, location, inventory status, and license 
plate apply to inventory structures 
 Tracking dimensions – Batch and serial number control tracking options 
The dimension groups of an item determine which inventory dimensions have to 
be entered when registering an inventory transaction. If the batch number 
dimension is active in the tracking dimension group of the item for example, you 
have to enter a batch number when posting a transaction. 
7.2.2.2 Dimension Groups and Settings 
In order to set up a storage dimension, open the form Product information 
management> Setup> Dimension and variant groups> Storage dimension groups. Product 
dimension groups and tracking dimension groups are available in the same menu 
folder. The forms for these three types of dimension groups look similar, except for 
the applicable dimensions which are specific to the particular group type. 
As shown in Figure 7-7 on the example of the storage dimension group form, the 
dimension group form shows the list of dimension groups in the left pane. The 
right pane of the form provides access to the inventory dimension settings for the 
dimension group selected on the left pane. 
If you need an additional dimension group, insert a new record by clicking the 
button New in the action pane and specify the inventory dimension settings of the 
new dimension group by selecting the checkboxes as explained in Table 7-2. 
In storage dimension groups, the dimension Site (see section 10.1.5) is always 
active, which is why a site has to be entered in every inventory transaction. For the 
dimension Warehouse, setting the additional parameter Mandatory to “Yes” requires 
registering a warehouse already when entering an order line or other transaction 
(if not selected, the warehouse may remain empty until posting).

Figure 7-7: 
Managing storage dimension groups 
When creating a product, you have to select dimension groups with active 
dimensions according to your requirements. You can for example only view the 
on-hand quantity per location, if the dimension Location is active for the particular 
item. If you need a particular dimension for some, but not all transactions of an 

274 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
item, the best way is to use a pseudo-value for transactions where the dimension is 
not suitable. If locations for example are only used in some warehouses, use 
pseudo-locations as default in all warehouses without locations. 
7.2.2.3 Dimension Groups in the Released Product 
In order to assign applicable inventory dimensions to a released product, click the 
button PRODUCT/Set up/Dimension groups in the action pane of the released 
product. If a dimension group is already specified on the corresponding shared 
product, it is not editable in the released product. 
In order to avoid invalid dimension values in posted transactions, it is not possible 
to change inventory-related settings of a dimension group once a transaction refers 
to the dimension group. For the same reason, it is not possible to change the 
dimension group of an item, if there is an open transaction or an on-hand quantity 
in inventory. 
If you need to change dimension settings for an item, post transactions completely 
issuing the stock physically and financially. After inventory closing, assign the new 
group and then post counting transactions to match the actual on-hand quantity. 
7.2.2.4 Simplified Serial Numbers in Sales Processes 
If you need to track serial numbers along the whole supply chain, the tracking 
dimension Serial number has to be active. For items linked to a tracking dimension 
group with this setting, inventory transactions are split by serial number which 
causes a high number of transactions. If serial number tracking is only required for 
warranty purposes in sales, there is no need to split inventory transactions by 
serial number in purchasing and other areas. 
In order to solve this issue, there is the option to track serial numbers only in sales. 
The serial number in this case is stored in a separate table linked to the inventory 
transactions. Sales serial numbers are only available for sales orders and return 
orders, not for other transactions (e.g. transfer orders). Serial number labels are 
physically attached to the item in inventory, but not tracked within Dynamics AX 
until the order is shipped to or returned from the customer. 
The sales serial number functionality is controlled by the tracking dimension 
group. If you want to use sales serial numbers, set up a dimension group selecting 
the checkbox Active in sales process for the serial number dimension. 
You can register sales serial numbers when posting the picking list registration, the 
packing slip, the sales invoice, or – if using advanced warehouse management – a 
sales transaction on the mobile device. 
After entering a sales order including one or more lines with items linked to sales 
serial number control, open – in the example of a packing slip – the packing slip 
posting dialog by clicking the button PICK AND PACK/Generate/Packing slip in the 
action pane of the sales order. On the tab Lines of the posting dialog, click the 

7.2  Product Information Management 
275 
button Update line/ Register serial numbers to access to the sales serial number 
registration form. 
In the serial number registration form, which supports using a scanner, enter or 
scan the serial numbers one after another. If a serial number label is missing or not 
readable on the physical item, click the button Not readable for the particular item. 
After closing the serial number registration, you can post the packing slip. 
For return orders, registration of sales serial numbers is also required in the 
packing slip posting dialog or on the mobile device. If you do not post a packing 
slip, but ship the item with the sales invoice (or receive it with the credit note), you 
can access the serial number registration from the invoice posting dialog. 
If you want to know which serial numbers have been shipped, open the serial 
number inquiry in the related journal inquiry. In case of a packing slip, click the 
button Inquiries/Serial numbers in the toolbar on the Lines tab of the packing slip 
journal. Tracking of sales serial numbers is also possible in the item tracing form 
(Inventory management> Inquiries and reports> Tracking dimensions> Item tracing). 
7.2.2.5 Dimension Display Settings 
The default for displaying dimension columns in detail forms is specified on the 
tab Inventory dimensions in the parameter form of all relevant modules. The 
inventory dimensions in the sales order lines for example are controlled in the 
accounts receivable parameters (Accounts receivable> Setup> Accounts receivable 
parameters, tab Inventory dimensions). 
Forms which show inventory dimension columns provide the option to change the 
display settings by clicking the appropriate button in the toolbar – e.g. Sales order 
line/Display/Dimensions in the toolbar of the sales order lines or Inventory/Display 
dimensions in inventory journal lines. 
When selecting inventory dimensions to display in a report or in an inquiry of 
inventory quantity and inventory value, you have to take into account that only 
these queries show a reliable result, which comply with the dimension setup. It is 
for example not useful to show the inventory value and cost price per warehouse, 
if the checkbox Financial inventory is not selected in the applicable storage 
dimension group. The reason is, that inventory valuation according to this setting 
does not link item issue transactions with item receipt transactions on warehouse 
level, causing a result which is different from your expectation. 
7.2.2.6 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Since the old “Warehouse Management II” module is not supported in the new 
release, the dimension pallet which refers to this functionality has been removed. 
And as a result of the cloud-based architecture, renaming of product dimensions is 
not available in the user interface. 

276 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.2.3 
Item Model Group 
Item model groups contain settings on the valuation method and on item handling. 
The number of required item model groups are depending on the requirements for 
processing items. In a usual Dynamics AX implementation, there are at least two 
groups – one for inventoried items and one for service items. The item model 
group for service items should allow negative physical and negative financial 
quantity and deactivate ledger integration. 
If you change the Inventory model or Ledger integration settings of an item model 
group after posting related item transactions, reconciliation of inventory and 
finance might become difficult. Before changing any of these settings, you should 
carefully consider the consequences. 
 
Figure 7-8: 
Available settings in the item model group 
In order to edit an item model group, open the form Inventory management> Setup> 
Inventory> Item model groups. The left pane of the item model group form displays a 
list of available groups. The right pane of the form then provides access to the 
settings of the group selected on the left pane. 
7.2.3.1 Settings on Item Handling 
In item model groups for inventoried items, the checkbox Stocked product needs to 
be selected. If this checkbox is cleared, products assigned to the group do not 
generate inventory transactions. This is the right choice for non-inventoried 
products like service items (except subcontracted production services). 
The checkbox Quarantine management controls the automatic generation of a 
quarantine order (see section 7.4.6) when posting an item receipt. 

7.2  Product Information Management 
277 
The checkbox Registration requirements controls, if you have to post an inventory 
registration (registration form, item arrival journal, mobile device transaction), 
before you can post the product receipt in purchasing (see section 3.5.3). The 
checkbox Picking requirements in a similar way controls posting the pick transaction 
before posting the packing slip in sales. 
The checkboxes Receiving requirements and Deduction requirements control, if you 
have to post a packing slip in sales or a product receipt in purchasing before 
posting the invoice. 
7.2.3.2 Negative Inventory 
In most cases you do not allow a negative physical inventory for inventoried items, 
but you do accept a negative financial inventory. A negative financial inventory 
results from posting a sales invoice before posting the purchase invoice (supposing 
no other stock is available for the item). 
Settings on negative inventory in the item model group are depending on 
dimension group settings: Dynamics AX controls negative physical (or financial) 
inventory only at the level of the inventory dimensions, for which the checkbox 
Physical inventory (or Financial inventory) is selected. 
7.2.3.3 Inventory Model 
Selecting an inventory model (FIFO, LIFO, weighted average, moving average, or 
standard cost) on the tab Inventory model determines the inventory valuation 
method. The valuation method is the way Dynamics AX assigns issue transactions 
to receipt transactions in terms of valuation. 
Details on inventory valuation methods are available in section 7.3 of this book, 
details on ledger integration in section 9.4.2. 
7.2.4 
Transactions and Inventory Quantity 
The transactions and the inventory quantity of an item are directly accessible from 
the released product form. Both inquiries, the transaction inquiry and the on-hand 
inquiry, are also available (in a filtered view on the current record) by clicking the 
button Inventory in the toolbar of order and journal lines (e.g. the sales order lines). 
The list page Inventory management> Inquiries and reports> On-hand inventory shows 
an overview of the on-hand quantity for multiple items selected in a filter dialog. 
7.2.4.1 Inventory Transactions Inquiry 
If you want to access the inventory transactions from the released product form, 
click the button MANAGE INVENTORY/View/Transactions in the action pane of the 
released product. The inventory transaction inquiry then shows all transactions of 
the selected item. The columns Reference and Number display the original voucher. 
In order to view the details of a transaction, click the button Transaction details in 
the action pane. 

278 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
In addition to posted transactions, the transactions form also shows future 
transactions not posted yet. These transactions include quotation and order lines in 
sales, purchasing, and production, for which no packing slip/product receipt or 
invoice has been posted. You can recognize such lines by the empty physical and 
financial date and the receipt status “Ordered” or the issue status “On order” 
(“Reserved physical” in case there is a reservation). 
 
Figure 7-9: 
Inventory transactions of an item in the transactions form 
The cost transactions of an item show a cost-oriented view of inventory transaction 
data. You can access the cost transactions by clicking the button MANAGE COSTS/ 
Cost transactions/Transactions in the released product. 
7.2.4.2 Physical and Financial Transaction 
When posting a product receipt in purchasing, a packing slip in sales, a picking list 
in production, or a report as finished journal, Dynamics AX inserts the posting 
date into the Physical date of the inventory transaction. In parallel, the status of the 
transaction changes to “Received” or “Deducted”. In the transaction detail form, 
the field Physical cost amount on the tab Updates shows the preliminary inventory 
value of the transaction. 
The Financial date in an inventory transaction is updated when posting the invoice 
in purchasing or sales, or when ending the production order. The status of the 
transaction then changes to “Purchased” or “Sold”, and the inventory value of the 
transaction displays in the column Cost amount. 
Dynamics AX does not change the posted financial cost amount any more. If you 
post an adjustment of the inventory value in the course of inventory closing or 
through a manual adjustment, the posted difference shows separately in the field 
Adjustment on the tab Updates of the transaction detail form. 
7.2.4.3 Inventory Picking and Registration 
Inventory picking in sales (see section 4.5.2) and registration in purchasing (see 
section 3.5.3) are special steps when processing an inventory transaction. Posting a 

7.2  Product Information Management 
279 
picking or registration transaction updates the on-hand quantity of the item and 
the status of the inventory transaction. But unlike product receipt and packing slip 
transactions, picking and registration do not generate an unchanging voucher. 
After posting the packing slip in sales (or the product receipt in purchasing), the 
date of picking (or registration) shows in the field Inventory date on the tab General 
in the transaction detail form. If you do not proceed the regular way – posting a 
packing slip after picking, or posting a product receipt after registration – but 
cancel the registration, it is not possible to view the original picking or registration 
transaction in the inventory transactions any more. 
7.2.4.4 Transaction Details and Ledger Integration 
In addition to the data in the inventory transaction list page, the tab Update of the 
transaction detail form contains core information on the inventory transaction. The 
fields on this tab are split into the field groups Physical, Financial, and Settlement. 
The field group Physical contains the date, number and preliminary value of the 
product receipt or packing slip. Invoice data show in the field group Financial. 
 
Figure 7-10: Physical and financial data in an inventory transaction 
If the value of a transaction changes after posting the invoice (through inventory 
closing according to the valuation method, or through manual adjustments), the 
value difference shows in the field Adjustment. The original financial Cost amount 
does not change any more, all later adjustments add in the field Adjustment. 
The field group Settlement shows if an inventory transaction is already settled by 
inventory closing. If the quantity of a transaction completely settles offsetting item 

280 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
issues or receipts, inventory closing records the closing date in the field Financially 
closed and closes the transaction (the field Value open on the tab General then shows 
“No”). Registering a manual adjustment of a closed transaction reopens it again. 
The slider Physically posted on the tab Updates of the transaction details shows if the 
product receipt or packing slip has been posted to the general ledger. As a 
prerequisite, ledger integration for physical transactions has to be activated in the 
item model group of the particular item. 
If ledger integration for financial transactions is activated, the option “Yes” in the 
slider Financially posted indicates that the invoice related to the inventory 
transaction has been posted. For purchase invoices, the slider is set to “Yes” after 
invoice posting even if ledger integration is not active for an item. The reason is 
that a purchase invoice for items always posts a ledger transaction: To a stock 
account for the receipt transaction if ledger integration is active, or to an expense 
account for immediate financial consumption otherwise. 
7.2.4.5 On-Hand Inventory Inquiry 
In order to view the current inventory quantity of an item, click the button 
MANAGE INVENTORY/View/On-hand inventory in the action pane of the released 
product form. The tab Overview of the on-hand form then displays a list of 
inventory quantities, grouped by the inventory dimensions selected as primary 
stocking dimensions for the item. 
 
Figure 7-11: On-hand overview of an item 
The button Display dimensions in the action pane of the on-hand inquiry (in a 
narrow screen, click the button 
 to view all buttons) opens a dialog, where you 
can select which dimension columns to display in the inquiry. If choosing to show 
an additional column with the batch number for example, the on-hand inquiry 
lines display the quantity per batch number. In order to view the total quantity of 
an item, clear all dimension checkboxes in the display dialog. 
7.2.4.6 On-Hand Inventory Details 
In order to view the details of a line in the on-hand inquiry, switch to the tab On-
hand. Apart from the Physical inventory, which is the current quantity in inventory, 

7.2  Product Information Management 
281 
the form shows availability data and the current cost price (average cost price, 
except for items with a standard cost price or a fixed receipt price). 
The physical inventory is the total of the transactions with following status: 
 Posted quantity – Invoiced quantity (purchase invoices minus sales invoices) 
 Received – Product receipts in purchasing, added to the posted quantity 
 Deducted – Packing slips in sales, deducted from the posted quantity 
 Registered – Registration and item arrival, added to the posted quantity 
 Picked – Picking in sales, deducted from the posted quantity 
Apart from purchasing and sales, the same status and calculation applies to 
transactions in production. 
All data shown in the on-hand form refer to the selected dimensions. The 
dimensions for example selected in Figure 7-11 are the site “HQ” and the 
warehouse “10”. According to this selection, Dynamics AX applies a filter showing 
the quantity and cost amount for this site and warehouse after switching to the tab 
On-hand. When viewing the cost price and cost amount, you have to take into 
account that data on costs are only reliable for dimensions with separate financial 
inventory (according to the dimension group settings). 
7.2.4.7 On Hand Inventory in the Past 
If you want to view the physical inventory on a date in the past, print or view the 
report Inventory management> Inquiries and reports> Physical inventory reports> 
Physical inventory by inventory dimension. 
7.2.5 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 7.1 – Dimension Groups 
In order to investigate the functionality of dimension groups, create a new storage 
dimension group DS-## and a tracking dimension group DT-## (## = your user ID). 
Set up the dimension groups in a way that the dimensions Site, Warehouse and 
Batch number are required in every transaction. For the warehouse dimension, 
separate financial inventory valuation should apply. 
Exercise 7.2 – Item Model Group 
As preparation for the next exercise, create a new item model group T-## (## = your 
user ID) with FIFO valuation (inventory model “FIFO”). The ledger integration for 
physical and financial inventory should be active. The item model group applies to 
stocked products and a negative financial inventory is allowed. All other 
checkboxes remain cleared, approved vendors are not required. 
Then set up a second item model group S-## for standard cost valuation, which got 
the same settings as the first group, except that the inventory model is “Standard 
cost” and a negative physical inventory is possible. 

282 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.3 
Inventory Valuation and Cost Management 
Based on the deep integration of the entire application, Dynamics AX provides a 
very accurate calculation of inventory values. In addition to the valuation methods 
for moving average and standard costs, there is the option to use an end-to-end 
FIFO or LIFO valuation. 
Apart from the inventory management module, which contains all data on 
inventory quantity and value, the module “Cost management” collects all forms 
and features related to inventory costing and valuation. 
7.3.1 
Valuation and Cost Flow 
Inventory transactions update the physical inventory quantity and the financial 
inventory value. In addition to the inventory transaction, which contains the 
complete physical and financial information, there is a cost transaction which only 
contains the cost-related information. Cost transactions are not generated for 
inventory transfers with no impact on the inventory value. 
7.3.1.1 Basics of Inventory Valuation 
The basis for inventory valuation is a simple principle: 
 Receipt costs – The value of receipts is specified in the receipt transaction 
 Issue costs – The value of issues is calculated according to the valuation model 
The receipt transactions determine the cost price and cost amount of related 
consumption (issue transactions). The principle for linking issue and receipt 
transactions is given by the valuation model (FIFO, LIFO, average). It is not 
possible to enter the cost price or the cost amount in an issue transaction. 
The standard cost price, which specifies the inventory value independently from 
the actual costs, is an exception to this principle. In Dynamics AX, there are two 
options for standard cost valuation: 
 Standard cost – Inventory value according to a pre-defined item cost price 
 Fixed receipt price – Similar to standard cost, but determining the receipt price 
The option “Fixed receipt price” is available in combination with the valuation 
methods FIFO, LIFO and average cost. Applying this option fixes the receipt cost 
price in advance, preventing to change it when recording a transaction.  
Unlike the fixed receipt price, the inventory model “Standard cost” provides true 
standard costs, immediately applying the standard cost price of an item to all issue 
and receipt transactions. 
The difference between the methods “Standard cost” and “Fixed receipt price” is 
obvious when changing the standard cost price of an item. Whereas the standard 
cost method immediately posts an adjustment of inventory value, the fixed receipt 
price method does not adjust the value of on-hand stock but applies the new price 

7.3  Inventory Valuation and Cost Management 
283 
only to new receipts – existing inventory will be issued with the old price until it is 
completely consumed. 
Including the standard cost valuation, there are seven valuation methods (selected 
in the field Inventory model of the item model group) for calculating the cost price 
and cost amount of issue transactions in Dynamics AX: 
 FIFO – First in, first out 
 LIFO – Last in, first out 
 LIFO date – LIFO, applying only receipts with a posting date before the issue 
 Weighted average – Average of receipts 
 Weighted average date – Average, but limited to receipts before the issue 
 Standard cost – Pre-defined standard cost price 
 Moving average – Keeping the average cost price 
7.3.1.2 Valuation of Item Receipts 
The final value of a physical receipt is set by the related financial transaction 
(invoice). Except for the standard cost valuation, which uses a pre-defined fixed 
price, the cost price and the cost amount in the different receipt transactions is 
calculated as follows: 
 Purchase order receipt – Amount of the invoice line including related item 
charges, adding indirect costs from the costing sheet as applicable 
 Production receipt – Cost amount of the production order (total cost of BOM 
item consumption and resource utilization, including applicable indirect costs) 
 Sales return – Original value of the returned item if assigned to an original 
sales order; Otherwise return cost price entered in the return order 
 Other receipt – Cost amount entered in the journal line 
7.3.1.3 Valuation of Item Issues 
At the time when you post an item issue (e.g. a sales packing slip), the cost price 
and amount is determined by the current average cost price (except for items using 
a standard cost price). Depending on the checkbox Include physical value in the item 
model group, this average cost price is only based on financial transactions 
(invoices) or includes the preliminary value of item receipts not yet invoiced. 
The valuation method is used when closing inventory. 
Inventory closing calculates the exact cost price and amount of an issue transaction 
based on assigned receipts. The inventory model (FIFO, LIFO, or average) is 
determining this assignment. The issue price and amount therefore is not final 
until you have posted the financial transaction (invoice) of all assigned receipts 
and inventory closing is finished. 
Assigning issue transactions to receipt transactions through inventory closing is 
required for all transaction except for items with following valuation methods: 

284 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
 Standard cost price – The standard cost price (“Standard cost” or “Fixed receipt 
price”) immediately applies to issue and receipt transactions 
 Moving average – Keeps the posted cost price of issue transactions and does 
not require inventory closing 
7.3.1.4 Standard Cost Price 
Items with the inventory model “Standard cost” do not require inventory closing 
because all receipt and issue transactions immediately apply the standard cost 
price specified in the item price form (see section 7.3.3). 
When activating a new standard cost price, Dynamics AX immediately posts an 
adjustment of the current stock value in inventory and in the general ledger. The 
new standard cost price therefore applies to issues of existing stock right away. 
7.3.1.5 Fixed Receipt Price 
The checkbox “Fixed receipt price” in the item model group applies in combination 
with the valuation methods FIFO, LIFO, or average cost. When selecting this 
option, the cost price entered in the released product form or in the item price form 
specifies a fixed cost price for receipt transactions. 
The cost price and cost amount are calculated according to the valuation method 
and – as long as you do not change the item cost price – always comply with the 
fixed receipt price of the item. 
When changing the item cost price, consumption transactions immediately apply 
the new cost price. Since there is no posting of revaluation when changing a fixed 
receipt price, the financial value of existing stock however still complies with the 
old price. As a result, inventory closing is required for the option “Fixed receipt 
price” in order to adjust the cost amount of issue transactions to the old price 
according to the valuation method (until all inventory received with the old price 
has been consumed). 
7.3.1.6 Moving Average Price 
For items with the inventory model “Moving average”, receipt transactions are 
posted with the price provided by the transaction (e.g. through a vendor invoice). 
When posting the vendor invoice, the financial transaction is depending on 
whether the quantity covered by the invoice is still on hand: 
 Complete quantity still on hand – The total amount in the purchase invoice – 
including possible differences – is posted as financial cost value in inventory. 
 Part of the quantity already consumed – For the quantity not on stock, the 
difference between the physical cost amount and the financial cost amount is 
posted as an adjustment to a price difference account. 
When posting an issue transaction (e.g. a sales packing slip), the average cost price 
at the time of posting applies. This cost price does not change any more, which is 
why inventory closing is not required.

7.3.1.8 Financial Inventory Dimensions and Inventory Marking 
In addition to the inventory model, the inventory dimension settings have got an 
impact on calculating the cost amount of an item issue. An assignment of issues 
and receipts is not possible across dimensions with a separate financial inventory 
according to the dimension group settings. 
If separate financial inventory is for example activated for the dimension 
Warehouse, issues of a warehouse “20” only assign receipts to the warehouse “20” 
(including transfers). If separate financial inventory is not active for the dimension 
Warehouse, assignments comply with the date sequence independently from the 
warehouse in the transactions. 
Marking is another option with an impact on the automatic assignment according 
to the inventory model. Markings work like lots for inventory valuation, assigning 
the cost amount of a particular receipt to a specific issue – e.g. used in vendor 
returns (see section 3.7.1). If you want to mark a transaction, click the button 
Inventory/Marking in transactions inquiries, order lines, or journal lines. 
7.3.1.9 Inventory Value Report 
The inventory value report is a configurable report with the option to set up 
multiple report versions for showing relevant inventory valuation data. 
As a prerequisite to run the inventory value report, you have to set up at least one 
value report layout (Cost management> Inventory accounting policies setup> Inventory 
value reports) specifying the inventory value data you want to show. When printing 
the inventory value report (Cost management> Inquiries and reports> Inventory 
accounting - status reports> Inventory value), select the report layout in the field ID of 
the print dialog. 
7.3.1.10 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in inventory valuation include the cost transactions and the 
new module “Cost management”. 
7.3.2 
Inventory Closing and Adjustment 
At the time of posting an issue transaction, Dynamics AX always applies the 
average cost price (except for items using standard cost a price). In order to 
calculate the final cost price and amount according to the valuation method 
(Inventor model) of the item, you have to close inventory. Only items assigned to the 
inventory model “Standard cost” or “Moving average” are not included in 
inventory closing. 
You need to close inventory periodically – usually as part of the month closing 
procedure in finance – in order to show correct item costs in finance and to close 
inventory transactions. After closing inventory, it is not possible to post inventory 
transactions in the closed period any more. If you have to post a transaction in a 
closed period, the only option is to cancel inventory closing. 

7.3  Inventory Valuation and Cost Management 
287 
7.3.2.1 Inventory Closing 
In order to close inventory, open the form Inventory management> Periodic tasks> 
Closing and adjustment which shows a list of previous closings. If you want to close 
a period there, click the button Close procedure. 
The first and second option in the close procedure, checking open quantities and 
cost prices, generate reports which help assessing inventory transactions. You can 
run these reports to take corrective actions – e.g. in case of missing or wrong 
transactions – before actually closing a period. But it is not required to perform 
these steps. 
In order to finally close an inventory period, click the button Close procedure/Close 
inventory in the inventory closing form. Depending on the number of transactions, 
it might be useful to run closing as a batch job not within regular business hours. 
 
Figure 7-12: The inventory closing and adjustment form 
As a prerequisite for closing a period in inventory, the accounting period in the 
ledger calendar has to be open. As far as possible, you should post all vendor 
invoices related to item receipts in purchasing, and end all production orders 
which are reported as finished. The corresponding product receipts in purchasing 
and production then show the financial cost amount (instead of the physical cost 
amount which shows before invoicing) which minimizes the number of open 
transactions. 
After closing inventory, you can access the posted adjustment transactions by 
clicking the button Details/Settlements in the inventory closing form. If you have to 
cancel inventory closing, click the button Cancellation. The button Recalculation 
calculates and posts adjustment transactions similar to closing, but does not 
actually close a period. 
7.3.2.2 Manual Adjustment of Inventory Value 
If you want to manually adjust the inventory value of an item, use the Adjustment 
feature in the inventory closing form. 

288 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
The button Adjustment/On-hand provides the option to adjust the cost price and 
cost amount of the current inventory quantity at the level of inventory dimensions 
(e.g. on warehouse level). The button Adjustment/Transactions in the closing form 
provides the option to adjust the cost amount of individual receipt transactions. 
In the adjustment form, click the button Select for choosing applicable items or 
transactions. In the selected records, enter a positive or negative adjustment 
amount in the column Edit now or retrieve a proposal for the adjustment selecting 
an appropriate option in the button Adjustment. Clicking the button Post in the 
adjustment form finally posts the adjustment. 
7.3.3 
Product Cost Management 
The financial value of inventory is a result of the quantity and the cost price of 
products. In order to support inventory cost management, the cost management 
module with the workspaces Cost administration and Cost analysis collects relevant 
information on item costs. 
7.3.3.1 Item Base Cost Price 
The base cost price of an item is specified in the released product form (field Price 
on the tab Manage costs). This base cost price is used as a default for the cost price 
and amount of item receipts in inventory journals and counting journals, if there is 
no site-specific cost price. In order to avoid transactions without (or with a wrong) 
cost price, make sure the base cost price is correct. 
The base cost price does not apply to items with the valuation method “Standard 
cost”. Standard cost price items require entering a cost price in the item price form. 
7.3.3.2 Costing Versions and Item Price Form 
Before entering a record in the item price form, an appropriate costing version 
(Cost management> Inventory accounting> Costing versions) has to be available. 
Costing versions contain separate versions of prices used for simulation and 
activation, providing the option to set up different calculation principles. Items 
with standard cost valuation use a costing version with the Costing type “Standard 
cost”, the costing type “Planned cost” refers to the other valuation methods. 
The cost price per site (in parallel to the purchase price and the sales price per site) 
is available in the item price form, which you can access by clicking the button 
MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in the action pane of the released product form. 
In order to enter a new cost price in the item price form, switch to the tab Pending 
prices there. For a cost price, choose the Price type “Cost” and select the costing 
version in the column Version. Select the applicable Site in case there is no default 
value from the costing version. Apart from the Price itself, the item price form 
contains additional price details like the Price unit or the price charges (similar to 
corresponding settings in the released product form, see section 3.3.3). 

7.3  Inventory Valuation and Cost Management 
289 
Once you have finished entering (or calculating) the pending price, activate it by 
clicking the button Activate pending price(s) in the action pane of the item price 
form. Active prices then show on the tab Active prices of the form. 
 
Figure 7-13: Activating a pending price in the item price form 
For product master records, cost prices are available at product variant level if the 
slider Use cost price by variant on the tab Manage costs in the released product is set 
to “Yes”. 
7.3.3.3 Calculation Group 
Calculation groups determine the basis for calculating cost prices and sales prices. 
You can set up calculation groups in the form Cost management> Predetermined cost 
policies setup> Calculation groups. The default calculation group is specified in the 
inventory management parameters (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory and 
warehouse management parameters, tab Inventory accounting). At item level, you can 
select a different Calculation group on the tab Engineer in the released product form. 
7.3.3.4 Cost Groups 
Cost groups classify and group different types of costs in cost calculation on the 
one hand, and specify different margins for sales price calculation on the other 
hand. You can access cost groups in the form Cost management> Inventory accounting 
policies setup> Cost groups. The Cost group type, which determines the basic costing 
structure, contains following options: 
 Direct materials – Material consumption 
 Direct manufacturing – Resource operations 
 Direct outsourcing – Purchased subcontracting services 
 Indirect – Overhead margins 
 Undefined – Unspecific cost classification 
In one cost group per Cost group type you should set the checkbox Default to “Yes”, 
making the selected cost group a default for the cost group type. 

290 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
In order to specify margins for sales price calculation, expand the tab Profit in the 
cost group form. You can register up to four lines with a different Profit-setting on 
this tab, entering an appropriate Profit percentage per profit-setting level. When 
executing a cost calculation or estimating production orders, choose an appropriate 
Profit-setting in the calculation dialog – e.g. not using the default if there is the need 
to apply a lower margin in a competitive situation. 
In the released product form, you can select a cost group in the field Cost group on 
the tab Manage costs. For items not assigned to a specific cost group, the default 
cost group for the cost group type “Direct materials” applies. 
7.3.3.5 Costing Sheet 
The costing sheet (Cost management> Ledger integration policies setup> Costing sheets) 
establishes a clear structure of item costs. It is used for estimation (cost estimation 
in production orders) and for costing (in the general item price calculation and 
when ending production orders), and has got two different purposes: 
 Cost classification – Classification by cost groups 
 Overhead costs – Specifying rules for calculating overhead costs of 
manufactured and purchased items 
For classification purposes, the costing sheet constitutes a multi-level structure of 
the different costs. Apart from the cost groups, which are the bottom level in the 
structure, the costing sheet can contain nodes for totals at multiple levels. 
 
Figure 7-14: Setting up a simple costing sheet 
Directly below the Root node, you can set up two primary nodes with the Node type 
“Price” and a different Type (field group Setup). The Type groups following items: 
 Manufactured items – Node with the Type “Cost of goods manufactured” 
 Purchased items – Node with the Type “Costs of purchase” (optional structure, 
if you want to apply indirect costs from the costing sheet instead of indirect 
costs through charges in purchase orders) 

7.3  Inventory Valuation and Cost Management 
291 
If you want to enter a new node in the costing sheet, select the higher-level node 
and click the button New in the action pane. In case you want to create a node for a 
cost group, choose the option “Cost group” in the field Select node type of the Create 
dialog. Then select the appropriate Cost group on the tab Edit in the new node. 
If you want to define overhead costs, select a node in the costing sheet with a Cost 
group referring to the Cost group type “Indirect”. Sub-nodes of such a node specify 
the calculation rules for overhead costs. When creating a sub-node for overhead 
cost calculation, select the option “Surcharge” or “Rate” in the field Node type of the 
sub-node. On the tab Absorption basis of the sub-node, select a Code specifying the 
basis for the calculation. Then you can enter a percentage or rate per costing 
version on the tab Surcharge (or Rate) before activating the indirect costs by clicking 
the button Activate in the toolbar of the tab. Main accounts for posting indirect 
costs to the ledger have to be entered on the tab Ledger postings. 
Before closing the costing sheet, save your changes by clicking the button Save. 
7.3.3.6 Item Price Calculation 
For finished or semi-finished items, you can run a price calculation based on the 
bill of materials and the route. For this purpose, there are two different options: 
 For a particular item – Calculating from the item price form, for example when 
creating a new item 
 For all items – Calculating from the costing version, for example if you want to 
calculate a new price for all items once a year 
If you want to execute the price calculation for a particular item, open the item 
price form (button MANAGE COSTS/Set up/Item price in the released product) and 
click the button Calculate item cost after switching to the tab Pending prices. The 
calculation works the same way as the calculation for all items in the costing 
version form (Cost management> Inventory accounting> Costing versions), where you 
can click the button Calculation after selecting a costing version. 
In the calculation dialog, select the Site and the Calculation date which determine 
the applicable active BOM and route from the released product. If starting the 
calculation from the item price form, you can override the default Quantity, or 
select a particular BOM and Route number in the dialog. If starting from the costing 
versions, you can enter an item filter on the tab Records to include of the calculation 
dialog. On the tab Price recordings in version of the dialog, you can specify whether 
to calculate the cost price and/or the sales price. 
Clicking the button OK in the dialog starts the calculation. Once finished, you can 
view the result in the pending prices (in the costing versions form, click the button 
Price/Item price for access). If you want to check the calculation, click the button 
View calculation details in the item price form to show all price components. After 
selecting one or more pending prices in the item price form you can activate them 
by clicking the button Activate pending price(s).

Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 7.3 – Product Record 
Enter two new items in the released product form as a preparation for examining 
the effects of the settings in the dimension groups and the item model groups: 
 Item I-##-S with standard costs (item model group S-## from exercise 7.2) 
 Item I-##-T with FIFO valuation (item model group T-## from exercise 7.2) 
For both items, the product subtype is “Product” and the storage and the tracking 
dimension group are the groups you have set up in exercise 7.1. Select an item 
group for merchandise and the unit of measure “Pieces”. The item sales tax groups 
for purchasing and sales should refer to the standard tax rate. The base purchase 
price and the base cost price is USD 50. The base sales price is USD 100. For 
purchasing, inventory and sales, enter the main site in the Default order settings and 
the main warehouse of the main site in the Site specific order settings. 
For the item I-##-S, you have to enter and to activate a standard cost price. Specify 
a standard cost price of USD 50 for the main site in the item price form. 
Exercise 7.4 – Inventory Value of Transactions 
Create a purchase order selecting your vendor of exercise 3.2. The order contains a 
line of 100 units of the first and 100 units of the second item entered in exercise 7.3. 
Enter a purchase price of 60 USD in both order lines and confirm the order. 
Try to find out, if you can post a product receipt without a batch number. 
Choosing the option View details in the batch number column, create the batch 
number B001 for both items in the batch table afterwards. Then insert this batch 
number in the purchase order lines. 
In the next step, post the product receipt and the invoice receipt for the complete 
quantity. If you look at the item transactions and the quantity on hand, can you 
explain the difference of the cost amount and the cost price for the two items? 
Exercise 7.5 – Valuation of Purchase Orders 
You want to order 100 units of the first and 100 units of the second item of exercise 
7.3 from your vendor of exercise 3.2. Enter an appropriate purchase order choosing 
the batch number B001 and a purchase price of 80 USD in both order lines. 
Once you have finished entering the order, confirm it and post the product receipt 
and the vendor invoice for the entire quantity. In the Product receipt date (on the tab 
Setup of the product receipt posting dialog) and in the Posting date (in the vendor 
invoice), enter the day after the posting date of exercise 7.4 (e.g. July 2, if exercise 
7.4 has been on July 1). 
After posting the invoice, check the inventory transactions, the inventory quantity, 
and the inventory value (cost amount) of the two items. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
293 
Exercise 7.6 – Valuation of Sales Order 
Your customer of exercise 4.1 orders 150 units of the first and 150 units of the 
second item of exercise 7.3. Enter an appropriate sales order choosing the batch 
number B001 in both order lines. Then post the sales invoice for the entire order 
quantity. In the Invoice date on the tab Setup of the posting dialog, enter the day 
after the posting date of exercise 7.5 (e.g. July 3, if exercise 7.5 has been on July 2). 
After posting the invoice, check the inventory transactions, the inventory quantity. 
and the inventory value (cost amount) of the two items again. 
Exercise 7.7 – Closing Inventory 
Run a Recalculation in the inventory closing form in order to calculate the correct 
inventory value according to the valuation method. In the recalculation form, set 
the recalculation date to the posting date of exercise 7.6 (e.g. July 3) and enter an 
appropriate filter which restricts the calculation to the items used in this exercise. 
For these two items, check the cost price and the inventory value (cost amount) in 
the inventory transactions and in the inventory on-hand quantity. Which changes 
are a caused by recalculation, can you explain the result? 
7.4 
Business Processes in Inventory 
The only way to change the inventory quantity of an item is to post an inventory 
transaction. Business processes, which change the inventory quantity and do not 
originate in inventory management but in other functional areas like purchasing, 
sales, or production, generate these transactions automatically in the background. 
A description of the processes in other areas is available in the corresponding 
chapter of this book. The lines below cover the business processes within inventory 
management itself. 
7.4.1 
Inventory Structures and Parameters 
As a prerequisite for inventory transactions, the setup in inventory management 
and in product management has to be finished. 
7.4.1.1 Warehouse Management 
Dynamics AX includes three storage dimensions which group the inventory within 
a company according to the physical warehouse structure: Site, Warehouse, and 
Location. Depending on the applicable dimension group, you need to record these 
dimensions in every inventory transaction. 
In order to set up a new warehouse, open the form Inventory management> Setup> 
Inventory breakdown> Warehouses and click the button New. In the new record, enter 
the warehouse ID, the Name and the Site. The site (see section 10.1.5) is a 
mandatory field which groups the warehouses within a company from a 
geographical and financial point of view. 

294 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
The lookup field Type determines whether the warehouse is a regular warehouse 
(“Default”), or a quarantine warehouse, or a transit warehouse. Quarantine 
warehouses are used for quarantine orders (see section 7.4.6), and transit 
warehouses for transfer orders (see section 7.4.4). 
 
Figure 7-15: Managing warehouses in the warehouse form 
A further structuring of warehouses including aisles and locations is required in 
the advanced warehouse management (see chapter 8.1.1). 
7.4.1.2 Storage Dimensions 
When setting up the warehouse structures, be aware that the storage dimension 
groups of the released products control the inventory dimensions, which are 
required in an inventory transaction. If you need locations in a particular 
warehouse, the storage dimension groups of all involved items have to contain an 
active dimension Location. Since this setting activates locations for all warehouses, 
you need to set up at least one (pseudo-)location for each warehouse in this case. 
7.4.1.3 Inventory Parameters and Journal Setup 
If you want to enter a manual transaction in inventory, you have to register it in a 
journal. Apart from sites and warehouses, inventory journals are another required 
setup. You can split the journals in inventory to two different groups: 
 Inventory journals – General transactions 
 Warehouse management journals – Receipts related to orders 
Inventory journals are used to register general transactions like item receipts, item 
issues, item transfers, and inventory counting. In order to configure inventory 
journals, open the form Inventory management> Setup> Journal names> Inventory. You 
have to set up at least one journal name for the Journal type “Movement”, 
“Inventory adjustment”, “Transfer”, “BOM”, and “Counting” before you can enter 
and post corresponding transactions. Assigning a number sequence in the lookup 
Voucher series provides the option to use a separate number sequence per journal. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
295 
Warehouse management journals are used for order-related item receipts and 
include two journal types: Item arrival journals (for purchase order receipts and 
customer returns), and production input journals (for finished goods receipts in 
production). In order to set up warehouse management journals, open the form 
Inventory management> Setup> Journal names> Warehouse management. 
Inventory parameters (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory and warehouse 
management parameters) contain settings for number sequences, the default unit of 
measure, the default calculation group, and defaults for journal names. On the tab 
Inventory dimensions, you can choose the dimensions which display as default in 
the inventory journals. 
7.4.2 
Inventory Journal 
You have to use an inventory journal, if you want to record a transaction 
independently from other functional areas like purchasing, sales, or production. 
7.4.2.1 Journal Structure 
Inventory journals in Dynamics AX show a common structure with following 
journal types for the different types of transactions: 
 Inventory adjustment – Manually changing the on-hand quantity  
 Movement – Like inventory adjustment, but with a user-defined offset account 
 Transfer – Between warehouses or other inventory dimension 
 Bills of materials – Consuming components and receiving a finished item 
 Counting – Registering the actual on-hand quantity and posting adjustments 
 Tag counting – Using tags as preparation for counting 
 Item arrival – Receipt related to a purchase order or sales return order 
 Production input – Finished goods receipt related to a production order 
Since inventory transactions have an impact on finance, the voucher principle 
applies: A journal has to be entered, before it is possible to post it in a second step. 
When accessing an inventory journal, Dynamics AX displays the related list page 
with the open journals which are not posted yet. If you want to view posted 
journals, apply an appropriate filter on the column Posted. You can access the 
journal detail form, which includes a header view and a lines view, by clicking the 
journal ID shown as link in the grid. 
7.4.2.2 Movement Journals and Inventory Adjustment Journals 
If you want to record manual changes of the item quantity in inventory, you can 
either use a journal of the type “Movement” or “Inventory adjustment”. 
The difference between movement journals and inventory adjustment journals is, 
that movement journals show the field Offset account where you can enter the 
expense account for item consumption (or the revenue account for item receipt). In 
inventory adjustment journals, the offset account derives from the inventory 
posting setup and does not show in the journal lines. For this reason, you want to 

296 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
use a movement journal for example when posting the item consumption of a 
department referring to a specific expense account. 
Section 7.1.2 at the beginning of the current chapter explains how to register and to 
post an inventory adjustment journal. 
In order to register a movement journal, click the button New in the list page 
Inventory management> Journal entries> Items> Movement and select a Name (journal 
name) in the Create dialog. In the field Offset account on the tab General of the 
dialog, you can optionally enter a default for the offset account in the journal lines. 
After switching to the detail form, enter one or more journal lines with posting 
date, item number, appropriate inventory dimension values, and quantity 
(negative for item issues). For item receipts, the cost price is editable (receiving its 
default value from the item). Finally post the movement by clicking the button Post 
in the action pane after making sure to apply the right main accounts in the 
column Offset account and appropriate financial dimension values on the sub-tab 
Financial dimensions of the Line details tab. 
7.4.2.3 Transfer Journals 
Unlike movement journals and inventory adjustment journals, which record issues 
and receipts, transfer journals are used to register a transfer of item inventory from 
one dimension-combination to another. In most cases, this is the transfer from one 
warehouse or location to another. But you can also use a transfer journal to change 
the batch or serial number. 
In order to register an item transfer, open the form Inventory management> Journal 
entries> Items> Transfer and enter a line similar to an adjustment journal line. But in 
addition to the data entered in inventory adjustment journal lines, you have to 
enter the applicable inventory dimensions to which the item should be transferred. 
Entering the Quantity with a negative sign issues the item from the “from-
dimensions” and receives it at the “to-dimensions”. 
Once you are finished with entering the lines, post the journal by clicking the 
button Post in the action pane of the journal list page or detail form. 
7.4.2.4 BOM Journals 
Bill of materials journals (Inventory management> Journal entries> Items> Bills of 
materials) provide the option to post the receipt of a finished item while consuming 
the components at the same time. In addition, you can – by entering a negative 
quantity – also disassemble a finished item. 
Unlike the way you work in the other journals, you do not need to enter journal 
lines manually in a bill of materials journal. In order to create journal lines, click 
the button Functions/Report as finished in action pane of the BOM journal detail 
form. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
297 
In the report as finished dialog, insert a line and select the finished item which you 
want to receive in inventory. If you select the checkbox in the column Post now, the 
bill of materials journal will immediately post once you close the report as finished 
form by clicking the button OK. If the checkbox Post now is cleared, the finished 
item and its component show in the bill of materials journal lines, where you can 
edit them before posting the journal by clicking the button Post in the action pane. 
 
Figure 7-16: Report as finished dialog, opened from the bill of materials journal 
7.4.2.5 Item Arrival Journals 
Item arrival journals (Inventory management> Journal entries> Item arrival> Item 
arrival) provide the option to post item receipts referring to purchase orders (see 
section 3.5.3) or customer returns (see section 4.7.1). Production input journals 
(Inventory management> Journal entries> Item arrival> Production input), which work 
similar to item arrival journals, can be used to receive finished products in a 
production order. 
Entering an item arrival journal is similar to entering an inventory adjustment 
journal. In order to specify the reference to a purchase order, switch to the tab 
Default values in the Create dialog (or in the header view of the detail form), and 
select the option “Purchase order” in the lookup field Reference before entering the 
order number in the field Number. For customer returns, select the Reference “Sales 
order” and enter the RMA number. If you want to use quarantine management, 
make sure that the appropriate slider in the field group Mode of handling is set to 
“Yes”. 

298 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
After creating the journal, you can optionally click the button Functions/Create lines 
in the action pane of the list page or detail form to retrieve default values for the 
item numbers, the inventory dimensions, and the open quantity from the purchase 
order lines (or the return order lines). 
In order to post the arrival journal, click the button Post once all lines are entered 
correctly. Unlike inventory journals, which immediately post the physical and 
financial transaction, arrival journals require posting the product receipt and the 
invoice of the corresponding purchase order (or return order) to generate physical 
and financial transactions. 
7.4.2.6 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The inventory journal forms have been redesigned in the new release (now 
showing a list page, header view, and lines view). 
7.4.3 
Inventory Counting 
In order to determine the actual quantity in inventory, you have to execute 
physical inventory counting (stocktaking) in the warehouse. Depending on legal 
and other requirements, periodical item counting is necessary to make sure that the 
posted quantity in Dynamics AX complies with the actual on-hand quantity as 
physically counted. 
In Dynamics AX, inventory journals of the type “Counting” or – in the advanced 
warehouse management – mobile device transactions (see section 8.1.4) are used 
for item counting. 
When posting an item counting journal, the difference between the counted 
quantity and the quantity in Dynamics AX is posted as item issue or receipt – 
similar to the transactions in an inventory adjustment journal. Since the counting 
difference is calculated as of the counting date, you do not need to stop other 
transactions in inventory while counting. But if required for organizational 
reasons, you can lock inventory (slider Lock items during count on the tab General of 
the inventory parameters). 
7.4.3.1 Counting Journal 
In order to register a counting journal, click the button New in the list page 
Inventory management> Journal entries> Item counting> Counting. In the Create dialog, 
you have to choose the inventory dimensions which are the basis for the counting 
journal. After creating the journal, there are two options for registering inventory 
counting: 
 Manual – Entering counting journal lines 
 Automatic – Creating counting journal lines from a proposal 
If you want to execute a completely manual registration, enter a journal line with 
counting date, item number, warehouse, and applicable dimensions like in any 
other inventory journal. The counted quantity has to be entered in the column 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
299 
Counted. The column On-hand shows the corresponding inventory quantity in 
Dynamics AX as of the counting date. The difference between the counted and the 
on-hand quantity shows in the column Quantity. This quantity applies to the issue 
or receipt transaction when posting the counting journal. 
 
Figure 7-17: Entering the counted quantity in a counting journal line 
If you want to create counting lines automatically, click the button Create lines/On-
hand (creating lines for items and related inventory dimension values which are, or 
have been, on hand) or the button Create lines/Items (creating lines for all items) in 
the action pane of the counting journal. In the Create counting journal dialog, select a 
filter on the tab Records to include – e.g. for counting a particular warehouse. 
Additional parameters in the dialog provide the option to restrict counting for 
example on items and inventory dimensions, which show an inventory transaction 
after the last inventory counting. 
After creating the counting journal lines manually or automatically, you can 
optionally print a counting list by clicking the button Print/Counting list in the 
action pane of the counting journal (before, after, or before and after entering the 
counted quantity). 
Once you are finished with registering and checking the counting journal, post it 
by clicking the button Post in the action pane of the journal list page or detail form. 
7.4.3.2 Counting Groups 
In order to support the selection of items when automatically creating counting 
lines, you can filter on counting groups in the Create counting journal dialog. 
Counting groups (Inventory management> Setup> Inventory> Counting groups) are not 
only used for grouping and sorting purposes, they also contain specific settings for 
counting. A core setting is the Counting code, which controls when to execute 
counting (periodically, when equal or below minimum stock, or when reaching 
zero stock). You can assign a counting group to an item in the released product 

300 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
form (tab Manage inventory) or in the warehouse items form (button MANAGE 
INVENTORY/ Warehouse/Warehouse items in the released product form). 
If you want to apply the counting code when automatically creating counting lines, 
set the slider Activate counting code in the Create counting journal dialog to “Yes”. 
7.4.3.3 Tag Counting 
Tag counting (Inventory management> Journal entries> Item counting> Tag counting) is 
an option to pre-register counting lines. The principle of tag counting is to attach 
numbered tags to the warehouse locations. When counting physically, write the 
item number, the quantity, and applicable dimensions like warehouse and serial 
number on each tag. Then collect the tags and register them in the tag-counting 
journal. When posting the tag-counting journal, there is no posting of inventory 
transactions, but a transfer of the lines to a regular counting journal. 
7.4.4 
Transfer Order 
Whereas inventory transfer journals are used to transfer items immediately 
without shipping documents, transfer orders provide the option to manage 
transport times and to print shipping documents. 
7.4.4.1 Setup for Transfer Orders 
As a prerequisite for working with transfer orders, you have to set up at least one 
warehouse of the type “Transit” in the warehouse form. This transit warehouse 
receives the items for the time of the transport. In addition, you have to assign a 
transit warehouse to each regular warehouse from which you issue transfer orders. 
If items apply the storage dimension Location, you should specify a Default receipt 
location and a Default issue location for the transit warehouse in the warehouse form. 
Delivery date control optionally applies to transfer orders (similar to sales orders, 
see section 4.4.3). 
7.4.4.2 Processing Transfer Orders 
In order to create a transfer order, open the form Inventory management> Inbound 
orders> Transfer order and click the button New in the action pane. The transfer 
order consists of a header, where you have to enter the From warehouse and the To 
warehouse, and transfer order lines, which contain the items to be transferred. 
After selecting the From warehouse in the header, the transfer order retrieves the 
related transit warehouse (shown on the tab General in the header view). In the 
transfer order lines, enter one or more records with item number, transfer quantity, 
and inventory dimensions as applicable. 
Similar to sales order processing, you can execute picking using basic warehouse 
processes (see section 4.5.2) or advanced warehouse processes (see section 8.1.3). 
Depending on the setup, you can also post the shipment immediately without 
prior picking. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
301 
In order to post the shipment, click the button SHIP/Operations/Ship transfer order. 
In the upper pane of the Shipment posting dialog, select the option “All” in the 
column Update for shipping the complete quantity (depending on the previous 
steps, you can alternatively select the picked or the ship-now quantity). The 
checkbox Print transfer shipment provides the option to print a shipping document. 
Clicking the button OK in the dialog posts a transfer to the transit warehouse. 
 
Figure 7-18: Entering a line in a transfer order 
When receiving the item at the destination warehouse, process the receipt – 
optionally posting a prior inventory registration or item arrival similar to the 
options in a purchase order (see section 3.5.3). 
In order to post the final transfer receipt (similar to the product receipt in 
purchasing), click the button RECEIVE/Operations/Receive in the transfer order 
form. In the Receive posting dialog, choose the option “All” in the column Update 
(depending on the previous steps, you can alternatively select the registered or the 
receive-now quantity). Clicking the button OK in the posting dialog then posts a 
transfer from the transit warehouse to the destination warehouse. 
7.4.5 
Item Reservation 
Master planning is used to ensure that a sufficient quantity is available to cover the 
future demand from sales orders, production orders, and other issue transactions. 
But in some cases, the supply provided through master planning is not sufficient to 
cover a changing demand. This situation can occur for example, if a short-term 
sales order picks inventory originally allocated to another order. 
In order to prevent that a later demand picks inventory already assigned to a 
particular order, you can use reservations. Reservations are primarily used for 
sales orders lines and BOM components in production orders, but you can also use 

302 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
them for any other issue (e.g. vendor returns, or transfer orders). Apart from 
manual reservation, Dynamics AX also supports automatic reservation. 
Reservation, which makes sure an item is available for a future consumption, 
works separately and independently from marking (see section 3.7.1), which links 
posted transactions for valuation purposes. 
7.4.5.1 Setup for Reservation 
Reservation works at item number and inventory dimension level. Dimensions 
selected as Primary in the dimension group (see section 7.2.2) have to be specified 
when reserving. Reserving at the level of the other active inventory dimensions is 
optional and you can change the dimension value later. 
In addition to the current on-hand quantity, it is possible to reserve a purchase 
order line (or a finished product in a production order) which is not yet received. 
As a prerequisite for this kind of reservation, it must be enabled in the inventory 
parameters (slider Reserve ordered items on the tab General). 
Automatic reservation applies when creating a sales order line with the reservation 
setting “Automatic” or “Explosion” (field Reservation on the sub-tab Setup). The 
default for the automatic reservation setting in the order line is specified in the 
item model group (field Item sales reservation). If the selected option for reservation 
in the item model group is “Default”, the order line default comes from the 
corresponding field in the order header, which again retrieves its default from the 
accounts receivable parameters (lookup field Reservation on the tab General). 
Automatic reservation of BOM lines in a production order is controlled by the 
lookup field Reservation on the tab Setup in the production order header, receiving 
a default from the production control parameters. Unlike the automatic reservation 
of sales orders, automatic reservation of production BOM lines does not apply 
when creating the order but when estimating, scheduling, releasing, or starting 
(depending on the option selected in the order header). 
7.4.5.2 Working with Reservations 
If you want to execute a manual reservation in a sales order, click the button 
Inventory/Reservation in the toolbar of the sales order lines. 
In the reservation form, you can manually enter the reserved quantity in the 
column Reservation, or click the button Reserve lot in the action pane. Clicking the 
button Display dimensions in the toolbar of the tab On-hand quantities provides the 
option to show applicable inventory dimensions if needed for a more detailed 
control of reservation at dimension level. If required, you can change or delete the 
quantity in the column Reservation and enter a quantity in another reservation line. 
Depending on the related inventory parameter setting, you can reserve only 
current inventory or also ordered items. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
303 
 
Figure 7-19: Reserving current inventory for a sales order line 
If automatic reservation applies, the reservation is done in the background and you 
can edit the reservation in the reservation form the same way as a manual 
reservation. In case there is not sufficient quantity available to cover the automatic 
reservation, the Autoreservation dialog immediately shows the problem. 
After reservation, the reserved quantity shows as Physical reserved (Ordered reserved 
if reserving a future receipt) in the inventory transaction and the on-hand inquiry. 
The reserved quantity is not available for any other transaction. 
7.4.5.3 Removing Reservations 
If you view the on-hand inquiry and it shows a reserved quantity which you need 
for another purpose, you can remove the reservation. From the on-hand inquiry, 
you can access the inventory transactions by clicking the button Transactions in the 
action pane. Select the appropriate inventory transaction with the issue status 
“Reserved physical” and click the button INVENTORY/View/Reservation to show 
the reservation form, where you can update the reservation as required.  
7.4.6 
Quarantine and Inventory Blocking 
If you want to exclude a particular quantity of an item from the available stock – 
for example because of the test results in quality control – you can alternatively use 
following functionality in Dynamics AX: 
 Inventory Blocking – Short-term temporary blocking 
 Quarantine Management – Transfer to a quarantine warehouse 
Inventory blocking, which is primarily used for quality inspection, generates a 
temporary inventory transaction for blocking. 
Quarantine management in comparison is based upon quarantine orders, which 
post a transfer to a quarantine warehouse. You can create quarantine orders 

304 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
manually whenever necessary, or automatically with every item receipt. When 
working with quarantine warehouses you have to keep in mind that only the 
quarantine order blocks inventory. Just posting an item transfer to a quarantine 
warehouse does not block inventory. Quarantine is not available in warehouses 
with advanced warehouse management. 
7.4.6.1 Setup for Quarantine Management 
As a prerequisite for working with quarantine in Dynamics AX, you have to set up 
at least one warehouse of the type “Quarantine” in the warehouse form. If you 
want to use automatic quarantine for item receipts, you have to assign a quarantine 
warehouse to each regular warehouse which applies quarantine. 
Automatic quarantine is used for released products, which are assigned to an item 
model group with a checkmark in the checkbox Quarantine management. 
7.4.6.2 Manual Quarantine 
The quarantine order page (Inventory management> Periodic tasks> Quality 
management> Quarantine orders) shows the list of open quarantine orders. After 
selecting the checkbox View ended you can also view ended quarantine orders. 
 
Figure 7-20: Managing quarantine in the quarantine order form 
In order to create a new quarantine order manually, click the button New in the 
action pane and enter the item number, quantity, warehouse, and applicable 
inventory dimensions. The default for the quarantine warehouse on the tab 
Quarantine inventory dimensions derives from the quarantine warehouse of the 
original warehouse in the quarantine order. The default for all other quarantine 
inventory dimensions are the initial dimension values of the quarantine order. 
After closing the quarantine order detail form, you can access it again by clicking 
the Quarantine number shown as link in the grid of the quarantine order list page. 
Clicking the button Start in the quarantine order form transfers the quantity to 
quarantine. Transfer to quarantine includes moving the item to the quarantine 
warehouse and reserving it for quarantine in order to block issue transactions. In 
parallel to the quarantine transaction, Dynamics AX generates a second inventory 
transaction for the future re-transfer to the original warehouse without date. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
305 
If you want to partly or completely scrap an item in quarantine, click the button 
Functions/Scrap. 
In order to end quarantine with or without prior scrapping of a partial quantity, 
click the button End in the quarantine order form. Ending quarantine posts the re-
transfer to the original warehouse and makes the quantity available again. 
Clicking the button Report as finished in the quarantine order posts the completion 
of inspections as an intermediate step. The item is not available in inventory before 
ending the quarantine order, which is why you want to apply this step only if you 
want to post the transfer back to the original warehouse separately. 
7.4.6.3 Automatic Quarantine 
When posting item arrival journals, production input journals, or product receipts, 
Dynamics AX automatically creates and starts a quarantine order for items, which 
are assigned to an item model group with selected Quarantine management. The 
further proceeding of quarantine works similar to manual quarantine. 
7.4.6.4 Inventory Blocking 
Inventory blocking usually applies in combination with quality orders (see section 
7.4.7). But you can also execute manual inventory blocking without using the 
quality management functionality. 
In order to block inventory of an item manually, open the form Inventory 
management> Periodic tasks> Inventory blocking and click the button New in the action 
pane. In the blocking record, enter the item number, the quantity and – on the tab 
Inventory dimensions – applicable dimensions. If you expect the item to become 
available again (like in a quarantine order), set the slider Expected receipts to “Yes”. 
Depending on the expected receipts setting, Dynamics AX generates one or two 
inventory transactions showing “Inventory blocking” in the column Reference. If 
you want to end inventory blocking, simply delete the line in the inventory 
blocking form. 
7.4.7 
Quality Management 
Quality management in Dynamics AX is integrated in the supply chain and helps 
to manage quality processes and issues. It consists of two components: 
 Quality control – Managing quality orders with quality tests 
 Non-conformance – Managing items which do not meet the quality standards 
Since quality issue processing is also possible by use of the case management (see 
section 10.5.2), which offers a much more flexible solution than the non-
conformance features in quality management (Inventory management> Periodic tasks> 
Quality management> Non conformances), the focus in the section is on quality 
control functionality. 

306 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
7.4.7.1 Setup for Quality Control 
As a prerequisite for using quality control, quality management has to be enabled 
in the inventory management parameters (slider Use quality management on the tab 
Quality management). The required setup for executing tests in quality control 
further includes: 
 Tests – Measuring individual characteristics of the tested quantity 
 Test variables – Only for tests with results from a list of values 
 Test groups – Sequence of tests to be executed in a quality order 
In order to set up a test, open the menu item Inventory management> Setup> Quality 
control> Tests and insert a line with test ID, Description, Type (“Fraction” for 
numbers with decimals, “Integer” for whole numbers, “Option” for distinct 
values), and Unit (for Type “Fraction” or “Integer”). For tests with the Type 
“Option”, you have to create a test variable (Inventory management> Setup> Quality 
control> Test variables) with the list of possible result values (button Outcomes in the 
test variable form). 
Once tests and applicable test variables are defined, you can create a test group 
(Inventory management> Setup> Quality control> Test groups). After inserting a test 
group in the upper pane of the form, assign the individual tests in the lower pane. 
For tests with the type “Option”, you have to select the Test variable and the Default 
outcome on the tab Test. For the other test types, the tab Test contains the field 
group Test measurement values for specifying the standard value and tolerances. If it 
is not possible to utilize the tested quantity after the test, select the checkbox 
Destructive test in the upper pane. 
 
Figure 7-21: Setting up a test group 
If you want to generate quality orders automatically, you have to set up item 
sampling and quality associations. 

7.4  Business Processes in Inventory 
307 
Item sampling (Inventory management> Setup> Quality control> Item sampling) 
determines the test quantity when automatically generating a quality order. In the 
field Quantity specification, you can select to test a percentage or a fixed quantity. As 
long as a quality order is not finished, the tested quantity is always blocked 
through inventory blocking (see section 7.4.6). If you set the slider Full blocking to 
“Yes”, blocking applies to the complete transaction quantity no matter which 
percentage is tested. After setting up item sampling, you can select it as default in 
the test group. 
Quality associations (Inventory management> Setup> Quality control> Quality 
associations) are used to assign items to test groups. When setting up a quality 
association, select the Reference type (e.g. “Purchase” for purchase receipts, or 
“Sales” if you want to execute tests before sales shipping), the item (with the 
options “Table”/ “Group”/ “All”), and the Test group (on the tab Specifications). The 
fields Event type and Execution on the tab Process determine the trigger for quality 
order generation. If you want to assign items at group level, you have to set up 
quality groups (Inventory management> Setup> Quality control> Quality groups) and – 
through Item quality groups – assign each relevant item to one or more quality 
groups. On the tab Conditions in the quality association, you can restrict the 
association to vendors, customers, or other applicable characteristics. 
7.4.7.2 Processing Quality Orders 
If you want to create a quality order manually, open the menu item Inventory 
management> Periodic tasks> Quality management> Quality orders and click the button 
New in the action pane. After selecting the Reference type (default “Inventory”) and 
further reference data as applicable, enter Item number, Test group, Quantity and 
required inventory dimensions in the Create dialog. The quality order header then 
shows in the upper pane of the form, the tests as specified in the test group show 
in the lower pane. The tested quantity is blocked through inventory blocking. 
After performing a test, click the button Results in the toolbar of the lower pane 
and enter the result (Outcome for the test type “Option”, otherwise the Test result 
value) with the Result quantity in one or more lines. Depending on the results and 
the Acceptable quality level specified on the tab Test of the quality order, the column 
Test result in the lower pane of the quality order shows whether the test is passed 
or not. Once the last test is finished, click the button Validate in the action pane of 
the quality order. Depending on the results, the column Status in the quality order 
header then shows “Pass” or “Fail”. Inventory blocking is removed and the 
quantity is available again (in case the test is non-destructive). 
In order to further block the quantity in case of a failed test, you can select to 
generate a related quarantine order when validating the quality order. 
Automatic quality order generation applies, if there is an applicable quality 
association when posting an event like a product receipt. The Item sampling in the 

308 
7  Inventory and Product Management 
quality association determines the quality order quantity. Depending on the Full 
blocking setting, the complete quantity or only the quality order quantity is blocked. 
Processing the quality order then works similar to a manual quality order. 
7.4.8 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 7.8 – Journal Transaction 
In the main warehouse, you find 100 units of the item I-## (created in exercise 3.5). 
Post an appropriate transaction in an inventory adjustment journal. 
Exercise 7.9 – Transfer Journal 
You want to transfer the quantity received in exercise 7.8 to another warehouse. 
Register an appropriate inventory transfer journal and post it. After posting, check 
the transactions and the quantity of your item in the selected warehouse. 
Exercise 7.10 – Inventory Counting 
You want to execute inventory counting for the item I-## (created in exercise 3.5) in 
the main warehouse. The counted quantity is 51 units. You can create a counting 
journal line either registering it manually, or generating it automatically with a 
filter on your item and the main warehouse. After entering the counted quantity, 
post the journal and check the quantity on hand. 
Exercise 7.11 – Transfer Order 
You want to move 60 units of the item, which you have transferred in exercise 7.9, 
back to the main warehouse by processing a transfer order. Before entering the 
transfer order, make sure a transit warehouse is assigned to the warehouse from 
where the item ships. Then register an appropriate transfer order and post the 
shipment. After posting, check the inventory transactions and the inventory 
quantity of your item in all warehouses. Finally, receive the item transfer in the 
main warehouse. 
Exercise 7.12 – Manual Quarantine 
Because of reported quality issues, you want to block the quantity you have 
transferred in exercise 7.11. Enter a manual quarantine order, choosing an 
appropriate quarantine warehouse. Check the quantity on hand of your item and 
start the quarantine order. After making sure that there is no problem with the 
item, end the quarantine and check the inventory quantity before and after ending. 
Exercise 7.13 – Manual Quality Order 
In order to prevent further quality issues, you want to set up and perform quality 
tests. Create a new test for measuring the length of an item in centimeters 
(including decimals). Then create a test group which only includes this test. The 
standard length is 100 cm with a tolerance of 10 percent above and below. 
Enter and process a quality order applying this test to 10 units of the item I-## 
(from exercise 3.5) in the main warehouse. The length of all tested items is 105 cm.

Warehouse and Transportation Management 
Depending on the particular requirements, you may need to manage pallets and to 
track detailed transactions within the warehouse. In Dynamics AX, the advanced 
warehouse management provides the necessary functionality for this purpose. 
Transportation management supports managing carriers and external transports. It 
is linked to the advanced warehouse management, but can be used independently. 
8.1 
Advanced Warehouse Management 
The advanced warehouse management (WHS) in Dynamics AX, which provides 
the option to register transactions through mobile devices on a HTML-based 
portal, is an enhancement of the basic warehouse functionality. Compared to the 
basic warehouse management, the advanced warehouse management adds 
following features: 
 Mobile device support – HTML-based portal for small-screen devices 
 Detailed tracking – Full visibility by generating regular inventory transactions 
 Flexible setup – Through location directives and work templates 
 Picking waves – Combining warehouse work for shipments 
 Simplified reservation – Through reservation hierarchies 
 Inventory status – Storage dimension for the status of units (e.g. damaged) 
 License plate – Storage dimension for handling units (e.g. pallets) 
Transactions covered by the advanced warehouse management are inventory 
registration in purchasing, picking in sales, and comparable transactions in 
production and transfer orders. In inventory, these transactions are preliminary 
steps before posting the physical transaction (e.g. product receipt, packing slip). 
8.1.1 
Core Setup for Warehouse Management 
Before you can start to execute advanced warehouse management processes, you 
have to complete the specific warehouse management setup in addition to the 
setup for inventory management. 
Advanced warehouse management only applies if both conditions are met: The 
item has a storage dimension group enabling advanced warehouse management 
processes, and the warehouse is enabled for advanced warehouse management 
processes. 
8.1.1.1 Parameters and Mobile Devices Portal Installation 
In order to use mobile devices, the mobile devices portal has to be installed. After 
downloading the stand-alone installer through the menu item Warehouse 
management> Setup> Mobile device> Download Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal, you

8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
can install and configure the mobile devices portal locally with a connection to the 
cloud-based Dynamics AX system. 
If the mobile devices portal is not installed, you can simulate the portal and 
execute warehouse transactions using the form WHSWorkExecute. You can access 
this form through the web address https://XX.com/?f=WHSWorkExecute&cmp=YY 
(XX.com = Dynamics AX URL, YY = Company), in this case signing in with a 
Dynamics AX user before you can access the login form for the warehouse user. 
The warehouse management parameters (Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse 
management parameters) contain basic settings for the warehouse management 
module, including the number sequences in warehouse management. 
8.1.1.2 Inventory Status 
The storage dimension “Inventory status” indicates the status or condition of 
inventory – for example good, damaged, or used. It only applies to items with a 
storage dimension group which has the advanced warehouse management 
processes enabled. In warehouses, which have the advanced warehouse 
management processes enabled, the inventory status is also used to block 
inventory (quarantine management is not available for these warehouses). 
Create at least one status for available inventory in the inventory status form 
(Warehouse management> Setup> Inventory> Inventory statuses). This status is 
required even if there is no need to block inventory through the inventory status. 
Optionally you can set up further status values. The checkbox Inventory blocking in 
the inventory status form controls whether a status blocks inventory. 
The default for the inventory status of transactions can be specified at multiple 
levels: At company level (warehouse management parameters), at site level (site 
form), at warehouse level (warehouse form), and in the default item status form 
(Warehouse management> Setup> Inventory> Default item status). 
Blocking through the inventory status applies the regular blocking feature in 
inventory (see section 7.4.6). Section 8.1.4 describes how to change the inventory 
status for blocking or unblocking an item. 
8.1.1.3 Warehouse-Related Settings 
In order to set up a warehouse applying advanced warehouse management, 
following configuration is required: 
 Location formats – Specify the structure of location IDs 
 Location types – Indicate the purpose of a location 
 Location profiles – Control available options in a location 
 Warehouses, locations – Show the physical structure of the warehouses 
Location formats provide a flexible setup for the structure of location IDs. Since it 
is a required setup, create at least one format with its segments in the location 
formats (Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse> Location formats). 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
311 
Location types (Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse> Location types) are used 
for filtering and grouping purposes. You have to create at least one location type 
for shipping and – if you use staging – one location type for staging. After setting 
up the location types, enter the location type for staging and the location type for 
shipping in the warehouse management parameters. Putting an item to the 
shipping location is the last step in processing a picking wave (see section 8.1.2), 
setting the status of the inventory transaction to “Picked”. 
Location profiles (Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse> Location profiles) 
group locations with common characteristics, for example determining location 
format, license-plate tracking, mixed items, mixed inventory status, and cycle 
counting. On the tab Dimensions, you can specify the capacity of the locations in 
terms of weight and physical dimensions (depth, width, height). The location 
capacity and the required storage capacity (weight, volume) of released products 
are a basis for calculating if there is capacity left for storing a product on a location. 
 
Figure 8-1: 
Setting up a location profile 
When setting up a location profile, select the appropriate Location format. In 
location profiles for regular locations, the slider Allow cycle counting should be set 
to “Yes” to make counting possible. In the location profiles for shipping and for 
staging locations, select the proper Location type for shipping or for staging. After 
creating a location profile for user locations, you have to assign it in the warehouse 
management parameters (tab General). 
Warehouses (Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse> Warehouses) have to be 
entered as described in section 7.4.1. In addition to the general settings, the tab 
Warehouse management contains settings for advanced warehouse management. If 

312 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
you want to create a warehouse applying advanced warehouse management, 
insert a new record in the warehouse form and set the slider Use warehouse 
management processes immediately to “Yes”. In order to access the warehouse 
locations, click the button WAREHOUSE/View/Inventory locations in the warehouse. 
In the locations form, optionally click the button Location setup wizard which 
provides a convenient way to set up multiple locations. For each location, the 
assigned location profile controls the characteristics of the location (e.g. the 
location ID format, the location type, or settings whether to allow different items in 
one location). 
In a typical warehouse, you can find at least following types of locations: 
 Receiving location – Intermediate location for purchase receipts 
 Shipping location – Intermediate location for sales shipping (bay door) 
 Staging location – Intermediate location for preparing shipments 
 Buffer locations – Storage locations for pallets and bulk items (bulk area) 
 Floor locations – Storage locations for single items (picking area) 
User locations – used as intermediate locations for the time between picking from 
one location and putting to the other location (handling time, e.g. for driving a 
forklift) – are generated automatically when setting up a warehouse user. 
After setting up the locations, close the locations form and select a default receipt 
location for the warehouse in the warehouse form (tab Inventory and warehouse 
management). 
8.1.1.4 Basic Setup for Warehouse Work 
Activities in the warehouse are reflected by “warehouse work” in Dynamics AX. In 
general, warehouse work always consists of a pair of activities – picking from one 
location and putting to another location. There are two basic types of work in 
Dynamics AX: 
 Planned work – For planned activities, e.g. processing a sales shipment, work is 
generated based on work templates in advance. Warehouse workers later report 
the actual execution of the planned work. 
 Unplanned work – Unplanned work, e.g. a manual quantity adjustment, is at 
the same time created and reported when executing such an activity. 
Unplanned work does not require a specific setup. For planned work, following 
setup is necessary: 
 Work classes – Group and to characterize work 
 Work templates – Determine what to do (e.g. “Pick” or “Put”) 
 Location directives – Determine where to pick or put (e.g. location “01-001”) 
Work classes (Warehouse management> Setup> Work> Work classes) for planned work 
represent the different types of work which are processed on mobile devices. In 
mobile device menu items, the work class determines which work you can execute 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
313 
through the particular menu item. In work templates for planned work, the work 
class is a mandatory field which links the work template to one or more mobile 
device menu items. 
Work templates (Warehouse management> Setup> Work> Work templates) are grouped 
by source document type (“Work order type”). If you want to edit the work 
templates related to a particular source document type, e.g. “Purchase orders”, 
select the appropriate option in the lookup field Work order type. In the work 
template lines, enter one line with the Work type “Pick” and a second line with the 
Work type “Put”. If required, you can enter additional lines – for example with the 
Work type “Print”. The button Edit query provides access to filtering criteria which 
control the selection of a work template when automatically creating warehouse 
work. Since Dynamics AX searches the appropriate template in the order of the 
Sequence number, templates with more specific criteria should be first in sequence. 
 
Figure 8-2: 
Setting up a work template for purchase put-away 
Location directives (Warehouse management> Setup> Location directives) control the 
physical place where to execute work per Work order type. The location directives 
for the Work order type “Purchase orders” and the Work type “Put” for example 
determine to which location to put an item after receiving a purchase order in the 
warehouse. 
You can set up multiple location directives per work order type (similar to setting 
up multiple work templates per work order type). After selecting the Work order 
type in the left pane of the location directives form, the tab Location directives on the 
upper right-hand side contains filter criteria on the source document generating 
warehouse work (e.g. a purchase order line with its warehouse and item). The 
button Edit query in the action pane provides access to filtering criteria based on 

314 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
item details and other relevant data. The Warehouse is a mandatory field in the 
location directive and therefore always applies as a filter. 
 
Figure 8-3: 
Setting up a location directive for purchase put-away 
In the Lines tab, you can additionally filter on quantity and units. The column Unit 
refers to the from/to quantity columns. If you want to apply a directive based on 
the unit, select the checkbox Restrict by unit and enter the unit after clicking the 
button Restrict by unit in the toolbar of the tab Lines (e.g. for moving full pallets of 
an item to buffer locations and individual units to floor locations). 
Since Dynamics AX searches an appropriate location directive in the order of the 
Sequence number, directives (and directive lines within a directive) with more 
specific filter criteria should be first in sequence. 
The Location Directive Actions tab specifies the location or location range to which to 
put (if the Work type selected on the tab Location directive is “Put”) or from which to 
pick (if the Work type selected on the tab Location directive is “Pick”). Enter 
appropriate filter criteria for this location after clicking the button Edit query in the 
toolbar of this tab. In the filter dialog, you can switch to the tab Sorting in order to 
specify sorting criteria (e.g. referring to the column Sort code in the warehouse 
locations). 
If there are products with batch numbers, select the checkbox Batch enabled in the 
location directive action for the work type “Pick” (as additional line if you got 
some items with and other items without batch control).

8.1.1.5 Basic Setup for Shipments 
Load templates (Warehouse management> Setup> Load> Load templates) represent the 
different inbound and outbound transportation units (e.g. different truck sizes or 
different standard containers). They are based on the different options for the 
physical dimensions of load. When generating a load for an outbound shipment 
(see section 8.1.2), the load refers to a load template. In transportation 
management, loads are the basis for planning and executing transports (see section 
8.2.2). 
Wave process methods (Warehouse management> Setup> Waves> Wave process 
methods) are predefined steps for wave processing. If the methods are not 
initialized, click the button Regenerate methods for initializing. 
Wave templates (Warehouse management> Setup> Waves> Wave templates) control the 
picking work with regard to characteristics like the grouping of work, automated 
steps, and applicable methods.

Setting up a wave template for manual wave creation 
In wave templates applying automatic wave creation, you can click the button Edit 
query in order to specify filter criteria.

8.1.1.6 Setup for Mobile Devices 
In the advanced warehouse management, you can flexibly set up multiple menu 
structures and menu items according to your requirements. After setting up one or 
more menus, assign each warehouse worker to the appropriate menu. 
The required mobile device setup in Dynamics AX includes the following items: 
 Mobile device display settings – Specifying the screen layout 
 Mobile device menu items – Determining the forms on mobile devices 
 Mobile device menus – Determining menu structures 
Mobile device display settings (Warehouse management> Setup> Mobile device> Mobile 
device display settings) define the display settings for mobile devices and refer to a 
style sheet on the Internet Information Server. 
Mobile device menu items (Warehouse management> Setup> Mobile device> Mobile 
device menu items) determine the forms which are available on mobile devices. The 
primary setting when creating a new menu item is given by the lookup field Mode: 
The mode “Work” refers to warehouse work (executing transactions), the mode 
“Indirect” includes inquiries and general features like logging off. 
 
Figure 8-5: 
Setting up a mobile device menu item for purchase put-away 
For menu items with the mode “Work”, the slider Use existing work controls if the 
menu item refers to work previously generated through a work template. 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
317 
In a menu item for creating work (required to execute unplanned work), set the 
slider Use existing work to “No” and select the applicable work item – e.g. 
“Adjustment in” – in the field Work creation process. 
In menu items for existing work (required to execute planned work), set the slider 
Use existing work to “Yes”. The lookup field Directed by in this case controls whether 
the system (“System-directed”) or the user (“User-directed”) chooses which work 
to execute. For User-directed work, the warehouse user has to enter or scan the 
work ID of the work which he wants to execute, whereas Dynamics AX shows 
which work to do next in case of System-directed work. In case the option “User 
grouping” or “System grouping” is selected in the field Directed by, the worker can 
register multiple pick-work lines on the mobile device, then press the button Done, 
and finally register one common or multiple separate put-transactions (controlled 
by slider Group put away). 
The tab Work classes in menu items for existing work determines the work which is 
available in the particular menu item. If there is for example only one line with a 
work class “Purchase” in this tab, you can only execute work generated from a 
work template line with the work class “Purchase” (and not a “Sales” work). 
Mobile device menus (Warehouse management> Setup> Mobile device> Mobile device 
menu) control the menu structure of the mobile device menu items. You can set up 
multiple menus and submenus. 
8.1.1.7 Work User Settings 
The workers using mobile devices are workers in the human resources module. In 
order to set up a new worker, open the form Human resources> Workers> Workers 
and create a new record (see section 10.2.2). 
 
Figure 8-6: 
Setting up a warehouse worker 

318 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
Based on the worker record in human resources, you can create the company-
specific warehouse workers in the form Warehouse management> Setup> Worker. For 
each worker, you can enter one or more work users on the tab Users. User ID and 
password for the work users are used for logging on to the mobile device. 
Multiple work users for one worker provide the option to display different menus 
for one worker depending on the warehouse. If a work user may switch between 
warehouses, click the button Warehouses in the toolbar of the tab Users and enter 
applicable warehouses. 
Creating a work user automatically creates a related location which is used as 
intermediate location while executing warehouse work. 
Note: If you do not want to set up warehouse workers as workers in human 
resources, you can create one “dummy” worker in human resources and enter 
multiple warehouse workers related to this “dummy” worker record. 
8.1.1.8 Product-Related Settings 
Related to products, following setup is required for using the advanced warehouse 
management functionality: 
 Storage dimension groups – Enable advanced warehouse management 
 Reservation hierarchies – Control the inventory dimensions for reservation 
 Unit sequence groups – Control the available units of measurement 
The storage dimension group as core setting controls whether the advanced 
warehouse management functionality applies to a released product. In the storage 
dimension groups (Product information management> Setup> Dimension and variant 
groups> Storage dimension groups), set up at least one storage dimension group with 
the slider Use warehouse management processes set to “Yes”. This setting activates the 
inventory dimensions Inventory status and License plate. 
In the reservation hierarchies (Warehouse management> Setup> Inventory> Reservation 
hierarchy), set up at least one reservation hierarchy. Reservation hierarchies 
determine in advanced warehouse management, which inventory dimensions are 
available for reservation in sales order shipments, transfer order shipments, and 
other outbound transactions: 
 Dimensions for order reservation – Dimensions above the dimension Location 
are available for reservation in order lines 
 Dimensions for warehouse reservation – The location itself and the 
dimensions below are only reserved at the time warehouse work is generated 
Unit sequence groups (Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse> Unit sequence 
groups) control which units of measurement you can use for moving and storing 
the product within the warehouse. The checkboxes Default unit for purchase and 
transfer and Default unit for production in the unit sequence group determine which 
unit applies as default for receiving assigned items (e.g. pallets for purchase 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
319 
receipts). The checkbox License plate grouping controls whether Dynamics AX 
generates a separate license plate per unit (e.g. pallet), or one license plate for the 
whole quantity in the selected unit, when receiving an item (grouping also requires 
selecting the checkbox LP grouping in the applicable mobile device menu item). 
 
Figure 8-7: 
Setting up a unit sequence group with pieces and pallets 
When creating a released product (Product information management> Products> 
Released products) for advanced warehouse management, you have to select an 
appropriate storage dimension group (for advanced warehouse management), a 
reservation hierarchy, and a unit sequence group in addition to the general settings 
as described in section 7.2. Apart from the weight and physical dimensions (depth, 
width, height) on the tab Manage inventory, you can enter the dimensions for the 
different warehouse units of an item (specified in the unit sequence group) after 
clicking the button MANAGE INVENTORY/Warehouse/Physical dimensions in the 
action pane of the released product. Weight and physical dimensions can be used 
to calculate the utilization of location capacity and transportation loads. 
In order to assign a reservation hierarchy to an item, click the button PRODUCT/ 
Set up/Reservation hierarchy in the action pane of the released product. The 
inventory dimensions in the reservation hierarchy have to match the active 
dimensions in the dimension groups of the item. 
The Unit sequence group of an item is specified on the tab Warehouse of the released 
product form. Depending on the units in the selected unit sequence group, enter 
appropriate unit conversions for the item. 
8.1.1.9 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
As a result of the cloud-based architecture, a stand-alone installer for the portal 
replaces the setup option in the Dynamics AX installation process. 
8.1.2 
Basic Warehouse Processes 
Core warehouse transactions include inbound processes – e.g. purchase order 
receipts, transfer order receipts, or finished goods receipts in production – and 

320 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
outbound processes – e.g. sales order shipments, transfer order shipments, or raw 
material picking in production. 
The figure below gives an overview of the warehouse layout and the structure of 
warehouse work, which is the basis for warehouse transactions. 
 
Figure 8-8: 
Warehouse layout and the structure of warehouse work 
In the overall order process, the mobile device transactions are another way for 
recording the inventory registration in purchasing (see section 3.5.3), the picking 
list in sales (see section 4.5.2), and comparable transactions in production orders 
and transfer orders. 
8.1.2.1 Purchase Order Receipt 
Starting point for a purchase order receipt in the warehouse is a purchase order 
line with a product and a warehouse which both are enabled for advanced 
warehouse management. The basic receipt process then includes following steps: 
 Initial receipt – Receive the item in the default receipt location 
 Put away – Move the item from the receipt location to the final location 
 Product receipt – Post the product receipt in the Dynamics AX client 
Section 8.1.3 describes further options for purchase receipts on the mobile device. 
The initial receipt of a purchased item is not based on work created upfront, but 
“unplanned work” generated when posting the receipt. Applicable mobile device 
menu items show the setting Mode “Work”, Use existing work “No”, Work creation 
process “Purchase order line receiving” (or “Purchase order item receiving”). 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
321 
In order to register the initial warehouse receipt on the mobile device, open the 
applicable menu item in the warehouse portal and enter or scan the purchase order 
number and the line number (or the item number). The default Unit for the receipt 
is specified in the unit sequence group, but you can select other units specified in 
the unit sequence group and split the quantity. Depending on mobile device menu 
item settings (slider Generate license plate), the license plate for identifying the 
handling unit (e.g. a pallet, a box, or an individual piece) has to be entered/scanned 
manually in the field LP (from a pre-printed tag) or is generated from a number 
sequence (which requires to print the tag when receiving). Dynamics AX then 
receives the item on the default receipt location of the warehouse. 
Posting the initial receipt generates warehouse work for executing the second step, 
the put-away work (picking the item from the receipt location and putting to the 
final bulk or floor location). Dynamics AX creates this work based on the 
applicable work template and related location directives in pairs of two or more 
pick/put steps (work lines), which are to be processed on a mobile device. You can 
view this work in the list page Warehouse management> Work> All work. 
In order to register the put-away work on the mobile device, open an appropriate 
menu item on the mobile device (with the setting Use existing work “Yes”, including 
the Work class specified in the applicable work template for purchase orders). 
Depending on the setting in the field Directed by of the menu item, Dynamics AX 
shows the next work (“System-directed”) or you have to enter/scan the work ID or 
license plate (“User-directed”) identifying the put-away work. After picking from 
the receipt location, Dynamics AX shows the put location (based on the location 
directive). Depending on work user settings, you can override the put-location. 
 
Figure 8-9: 
Registering the initial receipt and the put transaction on the mobile device 
After finishing the registration of the inbound transactions on the mobile device, 
the next step is posting the product receipt in the Dynamics AX client (see section 
3.5.4). Whereas inventory registration (including mobile device transactions) does 
not require a purchase order confirmation, the order has to be confirmed before 
posting the product receipt. 

322 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
When posting the product receipt in the purchase order or the summary update 
dialog, select the option “Registered quantity” (or “Registered quantity and 
services”) in the lookup Quantity of the posting dialog to make sure that the 
product receipt refers to the quantity registered on the mobile device. In case the 
product receipt refers to an inbound load (see section 8.2.2), you can also use the 
load planning workbench or the load form (Warehouse management> Loads> All 
loads, button SHIP AND RECEIVE/Receive/Product receipt) to start posting the 
product receipt. 
8.1.2.2 Sales Order Shipment 
Starting point for a sales order shipment in the warehouse is a sales order line with 
a product and a warehouse which both are enabled for advanced warehouse 
management. The basic shipment process then includes the following steps: 
 Reservation – Reserve the item before shipment 
 Shipment – Create the shipment and include the item 
 Load – Create a load for external transportation (before or after the shipment) 
 Wave – Create and release a picking wave with the shipment 
 Warehouse work – Execute the picking work on the mobile device 
 Confirm shipment – Close the shipment 
 Packing slip – Post the packing slip in the Dynamics AX client 
Before you can start processing a shipment in the advanced warehouse 
management, you have to make sure that the item is reserved. Reservation in the 
warehouse management applies reservation hierarchies. In order to manually 
reserve an item, open the item reservation form by clicking the button 
Inventory/Reservation in the sales order line. Manual reservation is not required if 
automatic reservation applies. 
 
Figure 8-10: Creating a load in the shipment form 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
323 
Shipments (Warehouse management> Shipments> All shipments) represent separate 
deliveries. If you want to ship a complete sales order, you can create the shipment 
by clicking the button WAREHOUSE/Actions/Release to warehouse in the sales order 
form. Alternatively, you can create shipments automatically through the batch job 
Warehouse management> Release to warehouse> Automatic release of sales orders. This 
batch job applies related settings in the accounts receivable parameters (tab 
Warehouse management) and in the customer form as minimum criteria for 
releasing. After creating the shipment, the order header shows the status 
“Released” (column Release status in the sales order list page). 
If there is a load already before the shipment (e.g. for transportation planning 
purposes), you have to generate the shipment from the load in the load planning 
workbench (see section 8.2.2). 
A load (Warehouse management> Loads> All loads) represents an inbound or 
outbound transportation unit (e.g. a truck). One load contains one or more 
shipments. One sales order line can be split into multiple shipments and loads, for 
example if the transportation unit is too small to cover the complete order line 
quantity. In this case, reduce the quantity when creating the first load and then 
create a second load. 
You can create the load before creating the shipment (in the load planning 
workbench), or after creating the shipment (in the shipment form), or skip 
manually creating the load. If you want to create a load from the shipment, click 
the button SHIPMENTS/Shipments/Transfer shipment to new load in the shipment 
form. If you want to ship multiple orders together, add them to one common load 
(button Transfer the shipment to an existing load). If the load is not created before 
processing the wave, it is generated automatically at this step. Depending on 
warehouse 
management 
parameter 
settings, 
loads 
are 
already 
created 
automatically at order entry. 
 
Figure 8-11: Manually creating a wave  

324 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
A wave (Warehouse management> Outbound waves> Shipment waves> All waves) is a 
group of shipments to be processed together in the warehouse. Depending on 
settings in the Wave template, waves are created and processed automatically. If 
automatic wave processing applies, settings in the warehouse management 
parameters determine whether wave processing runs online or in a batch job. 
In order to create a wave manually, click the button New in the wave form and 
select a wave template in the Create dialog. Then add one or more shipments in the 
Maintain shipments form, which you can access by clicking the button WAVE/Wave/ 
Maintain shipments in the wave. 
Alternatively, create a wave in the workspace Outbound work planning by selecting 
the shipment in the tabbed list pane and clicking the button Add to new wave in the 
toolbar of the list. 
The next step is to process the wave by clicking the button WAVE/Wave/Process in 
the wave form. Processing a wave generates the warehouse work. You can view 
this work by clicking the button WAVE/Related information/Work in the action pane 
of the wave form, or through the menu item Warehouse management> Work> All 
work. At this stage, the wave has the status “Held” and the work is blocked. Before 
you can actually start executing the warehouse work, you have to release the wave 
(button WAVE/Wave/Release in the wave form). 
 
Figure 8-12: Registering the sales pick and put transaction on the mobile device 
In order to process the wave in the warehouse, open a menu item for sales order 
picking on the mobile device. Depending on settings in the menu item (field 
Directed by), Dynamics AX shows the picking work to be executed (“System-
directed”) or you have to enter or scan (usually scanning from a printed picking 
list) the work ID of the work created from the wave. After picking the item from 
the location given by the applicable location directive for the work type “Pick”, put 
the item to the outbound location given by the location directive for the work type 
“Put”. Depending on settings in the work user you can override the pick- and the 
put-location. Settings in the wave template control whether there are additional 
steps for staging and for replenishment. 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
325 
As last step in the outbound warehouse process, confirming closes the shipment 
and the load. Apart from automatically confirming through appropriate work 
audit templates, there are following options for manually confirming a shipment: 
 In the shipment form – Button SHIPMENTS/Shipments/Confirm shipment (only 
available if the load does not contain multiple shipments) 
 In the load form – Button SHIP AND RECEIVE/Confirm/Outbound shipment 
 In the load planning workbench – Button Ship and receive/Outbound shipment on 
the tab Loads 
After confirming the shipment, you can post the packing slip by clicking the button 
SHIPMENT/Generate/Packing slip in the shipment form (select the checkbox Display 
closed shipments if the shipment does not show). Alternatively, you can post the 
packing slip in the load form (button SHIP AND RECEIVE/Generate/Packing slip), or 
in the load planning workbench (button Generate/Packing slip in the toolbar on the 
tab Loads), or in the sales order form (see section 4.5.4). 
8.1.2.3 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in processing advanced warehouse management transactions 
include the workspaces Outbound work planning and Outbound work monitoring. 
8.1.3 
Advanced Options for Inbound and Outbound Processes 
In addition to the basic process for purchase order receipts and sales order 
shipments, there are variants of these processes including the option to automatize 
steps or to apply staging. Transfer orders and production orders are further 
variants of the inbound and outbound processes. 
8.1.3.1 Task Automation 
Apart from manually executing activities, there is the option to automatically 
perform particular tasks. Depending on the setup, Dynamics AX provides 
following options: 
 Work execution – Automatically executing warehouse work 
o Automatically process – Checkbox in work templates (Warehouse 
management> Setup> Work> Work templates) for automatically executing the 
work when releasing a wave (e.g. for bulk items not tracked in detail) 
o Work confirmation setup – Button in the action pane of mobile device menu 
items (Warehouse management> Setup> Mobile device> Mobile device menu items), 
providing the option to Auto confirm the Work type “Put” for example (you 
only need to register the pick work on the mobile device in this case) 
 Picking process – Automatically creating/releasing shipments/loads/waves 
o Release to warehouse – Automatically creating shipments through the batch 
job Warehouse management> Release to warehouse> Automatic release of sales 
orders (applies customer and accounts receivable parameter settings) 

326 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
o Automate wave creation – Slider in the wave template (Warehouse 
management> Setup> Waves> Wave templates), controlling automatic wave 
creation when releasing to warehouse 
o Automatically process waves – Sliders in the wave template for processing 
the wave when releasing to warehouse or when reaching the threshold in 
the wave template (in batch or online, depending on warehouse parameters) 
o Automate wave release – Slider in the wave template for releasing waves 
o Automatically create loads – Setting in the warehouse parameters; In 
addition, loads are always created automatically when processing a wave if 
there is no load 
General options for automatic reservation when entering a sales order line (see 
section 7.4.5) also apply to the advanced warehouse management. In addition, the 
tab Warehouse in the warehouse form contains the sliders Reserve inventory at load 
posting (reserving when releasing to warehouse from the load planning 
workbench) and Reserve when orders are released by a batch job (reserving when 
running the Release to warehouse batch job mentioned above) providing further 
options for automatic reservation in the advanced warehouse management. 
Work audit templates (Warehouse management> Setup> Work> Work audit template) 
provide the option to assign additional actions to a mobile device menu item. You 
can for example create an audit template with a line (on the tab Lines) containing 
the Function “Event” and the Event “Shipping confirmed” and select this audit 
template in an applicable mobile device menu item, if you want to automatically 
confirm the shipment after executing the warehouse work for sales picking. Other 
features in the audit template lines include the option to display and print data. 
8.1.3.2 Options for Purchase Receipts 
The advanced warehouse management in Dynamics AX supports following 
options for purchase order receipts: 
 Two-step order receipt – Receiving with reference to the purchase order 
number and separately putting away (described in section 8.1.2) 
 Load item receipt – Receiving with reference to the load (instead of the order) 
 One-step receipt – Receiving and putting away in one step 
A load item receipt is based on an inbound load, which includes one or more 
purchase orders. As a prerequisite for load item receipts, you have to set up a 
mobile device menu item with the Work creation process “Load item receiving”. 
After entering a purchase order and creating a related load in the load planning 
workbench (see section 8.2.2), you can execute the receipt selecting the Load ID 
instead of the purchase order number on the mobile device. Receiving generates 
put away work, which is to be executed like purchase order receipts. 
Apart from the two-step receipt, which preliminarily receives the items on the 
default receipt location, you can execute a one-step receipt immediately moving 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
327 
the items to the final location. As a prerequisite for one-step receipts, you have to 
create a mobile device menu item with the Work creation process “Purchase order 
item receiving and put away”, or “Purchase order line receiving and put away”, or 
“Load item receiving and put away”. Using one of these menu items, receiving and 
putting away is done in one common transaction. 
8.1.3.3 Directive Codes 
When generating warehouse work, Dynamics AX independently searches for the 
appropriate work template and location directive. If you want to link a work 
template with a location directive, you can use directive codes. Following setup is 
required for this purpose: 
 Directive code – Create a code (Warehouse management> Setup> Directive codes) 
 Work template – Select the Directive code in applicable work template lines 
(only in “Put” work template lines of outbound processes) 
 Location directive – Select the directive code in location directives as needed 
When creating work based on a work template with an assigned directive code, 
Dynamics AX does not independently search the location directive but applies the 
location directive with the same directive code. 
8.1.3.4 Staging 
Staging is used to collect and prepare picked items on a special location for staging 
before loading (e.g. a truck). 
 
Figure 8-13: Work template for staging (without a directive code for the final put work) 
In addition to the basic setup for sales order shipments, following setup is required 
if you want to use staging: 

328 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
 Directive code – Additional directive code for staging 
 Work template – Contains work lines for staging and for loading 
 Location directive – Location directive to put to the staging location 
 Mobile device menu items – Contain the Work class of the work template lines 
In order to link the “Put” work template line for staging with the related location 
directive, enter a directive code in this work template line. Then set up a particular 
location directive (with this directive code) for putting to the staging location. If 
there is no general default location directive for putting to the final shipping 
location which you can use also after staging, you have to set up a separate 
directive code and location directive for this final put work. 
In a similar way to the sales order picking process without staging, you can 
execute the outbound process if you use staging. Create the shipment, the load, 
and the wave, and release the wave (applying the work template for staging). 
The work created from the wave includes four steps in case of staging: Picking 
from the original location, putting to the staging location, picking from the staging 
location, and putting to the final shipping location. On the mobile device, the 
warehouse work for staging (pick and then put to the staging location) and for 
loading (pick and then put to the final shipping location) has to be registered in 
separate steps. 
8.1.3.5 Work Pools 
Work pools are used to group work, for example collecting all work in a particular 
warehouse zone. In order to use work pools, following setup is required: 
 Work pool – Create a pool (Warehouse management> Setup> Work> Work pools) 
 Work template – Select the Work pool ID in applicable work templates 
 Mobile device menu items – Create or adjust menu items for using work pools 
(Directed by = “System grouping”, System grouping field = “workpoolid”) 
In the work records (Warehouse management> Work> All work), the work pool is an 
editable field receiving the default from work template. 
On the mobile device, the work pool displays instead of the work ID when 
opening a menu item which is configured to use work pools. The work is grouped 
by the work pool then. 
8.1.3.6 Transfer Orders 
Transfer orders (see section 7.4.4) are used to move items from on warehouse to 
another. Dynamics AX supports all possible combinations of transfers from and to 
a warehouse with and without advanced warehouse management. Shipping a 
transfer order from a WHS-warehouse (warehouse with advanced warehouse 
management) works similar to shipping a sales order, and receiving a transfer 
order on a WHS-warehouse works similar to receiving a purchase order. 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
329 
As a prerequisite for processing transfer orders in a shipping or receiving 
warehouse with advanced warehouse management, following setup is required 
(similar to the setup for purchase order receipts and sales order shipments): 
 Item, warehouse(s) – Enabled for advanced warehouse management (a transfer 
between two WHS-warehouses requires a WHS-enabled transit warehouse) 
 Work classes, work templates, location directives – For the work order types 
“Transfer issue” and “Transfer receipt” 
 Mobile device menu items 
o For transfer issue – Use existing work = “Yes”, work class for transfer issue 
o For transfer receipt – Use existing work = “No”, Work creation process = 
“License plate receiving” or “License plate receiving and put away” (or 
“Transfer order line receiving” if the from-warehouse is not WHS-enabled) 
o For transfer receipt put-away – Use existing work = “Yes”, work class for 
transfer receipt (only required for two-step receipts) 
 Wave template – Only if you don’t want to use the template for sales shipments 
 
Figure 8-14: Location directive for transfer issues (“Put” work to the shipping location) 
In order to use the advanced warehouse management in transfer processing, create 
a transfer order (Inventory management> Inbound orders> Transfer order) which ships 
from and/or to a warehouse with advanced warehouse management. 
If the from-warehouse is WHS-enabled, the first step is to reserve the item 
(automatically or manually). Then create a shipment (similar to sales order 
shipments) by releasing the transfer order manually or automatically to the 

330 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
warehouse, e.g. by clicking the button SHIP/Operations/Release to warehouse in the 
transfer order form. Then create the load and the wave, assign the transfer order, 
process the wave, and release the wave (depending on settings in the wave 
template, the steps are executed automatically or manually). On the mobile device, 
you can execute the picking work including putting to the final shipping location 
in the from-warehouse afterwards. 
Confirming the shipment then posts a transfer to the transit warehouse. 
In order to receive the item in the to-warehouse, make sure the warehouse worker 
is signed in to the appropriate warehouse in the warehouse portal and execute the 
receipt work on the mobile device similar to receiving a purchase order. When 
receiving a transfer from a WHS-enabled warehouse, you have to use a menu item 
for “License plate receiving” requiring to enter/scan the license plate(s) assigned to 
the item in the prior shipping process. If the from-warehouse is not WHS-enabled, 
you have to use a menu item for “Transfer order line receiving” requiring to 
enter/scan the transfer order number. 
In case the from-warehouse does not apply advanced warehouse management, 
you have to execute the standard transfer order process (see section 7.4.4) for 
shipping from this warehouse. If the to-warehouse does not apply advanced 
warehouse management, the standard transfer order process has to be executed for 
receiving. 
8.1.3.7 Production Orders 
In a production environment, Dynamics AX supports the picking of materials and 
the receipt of finished products in warehouses with advanced warehouse 
management. As a prerequisite for processing production orders using advanced 
warehouse management, following setup is required (similar to the setup for 
purchase order receipts and sales order shipments): 
 Items – Materials and finished products enabled for advanced warehouse 
management 
 Warehouse – Enabled for advanced warehouse management; One or more 
warehouse locations in the production area; Default production finished goods 
location in the warehouse form 
 Production input location – On resource, resource group, or warehouse 
(production location for raw material consumption, thus “Put” location for 
warehouse work) 
 Work classes, work templates, location directives – For the work order types 
“Raw material picking” and “Finished goods put away” 
 Wave template – Separately from sales shipment templates, select “Production 
orders” in the left pane of the wave template form 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
331 
 Mobile device menu items 
o For materials – Use existing work = “Yes”, work class for raw material picking 
o For finished product receipt – Use existing work = “No”, Work creation process 
= “Report as finished” (or “Report as finished and put away”) 
o For finished product put-away – Use existing work = “Yes”, work class for 
finished product receipt (only required for two-step receipts) 
In order to use the advanced warehouse management in manufacturing, create and 
process a production order (Production control> Production Orders> All production 
orders) as described in section 5.4.2. Depending on settings for automatic 
reservation (field Reservation on the tab Setup of the production order detail form), 
you may have to reserve the raw materials manually after estimation or releasing. 
Once the production order is released, create a production wave (Warehouse 
management> Outbound waves> Production waves> All waves), assign the production 
order (button Maintain productions), process the wave, and release the wave 
(depending on settings in the production wave template, the steps are executed 
automatically or manually). Processing the wave creates warehouse work for raw 
material picking, which you can view by clicking the button WAVE/Related 
information/Work in the action pane of the wave form. 
 
Figure 8-15: Manually creating a production wave 
On the mobile device, you can execute the warehouse work then. After putting the 
item to the production input location, the material is immediately consumed 
(inventory status “Picked”) or only reserved (inventory status “Reserved 
physical”) depending on the setting for the Issue status after raw material picking 
(field on the tab Inventory and warehouse management in the warehouse form). In the 
Dynamics AX client, you can start the production order and post the picking list 
related to the registered warehouse work afterwards. 
In order to receive the finished product, open the menu item for “Report as 
finished” or “Report as finished and put away” on the mobile device (working 

332 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
similar to a purchase order receipt). The mobile device transaction posts a report as 
finished journal in production and receives the product on the Default production 
finished goods location of the warehouse (or directly on the final floor or bulk 
location in case of a one-step receipt). In case of a two-step receipt, the mobile 
device receipt generates warehouse work for the put-away to the final bulk or floor 
location to be executed in a separate menu item on the mobile device. 
In order to update the production order status to “Reported as finished”, click the 
button PRODUCTION ORDER/Process/Report as finished in the action pane of the 
production order form as usual. 
Instead of reporting as finished by receiving the finished product on the mobile 
device, you can first report a production order as finished in the Dynamics AX 
client. In this case, reporting as finished in the production order initially receives 
the item and – based on the work template for “Finished goods put away” – creates 
warehouse work for the put-away to the final bulk or floor location. 
8.1.4 
Tasks within the Warehouse 
Apart from inbound and outbound transactions, warehouse operations include 
internal transactions like counting and movements between locations and tasks 
like inventory blocking. 
8.1.4.1 Inventory Blocking 
Blocking in inventory is used to prevent transactions, for example selling an 
inventory quantity which has got quality issues. In the advanced warehouse 
management, you can block inventory by changing the dimension value in the 
storage dimension Inventory status of a quantity on-hand. This blocking applies the 
standard inventory blocking feature in inventory management (see section 7.4.6). 
After blocking a quantity in inventory, outbound transactions are not possible. If 
you receive a purchase order line with the status “Blocked”, Dynamics AX blocks 
the received quantity. 
Following setup is required to use the inventory status for blocking: 
 Inventory status – Status value with “Inventory blocking” (see section 8.1.1) 
 Disposition codes – Required for changing the status on mobile devices 
 Mobile device menu items – Setting to show the disposition code 
Forms for blocking inventory on the mobile device do not directly show the 
inventory status, but the disposition code. Each disposition code (Warehouse 
management> Setup> Mobile device> Disposition codes) is linked to an inventory status. 
If you want to be able to change the inventory status through the disposition code 
in a separate transaction on the mobile device, create a mobile device menu item 
with the required settings (Mode = “Work”, Use existing work = “No”, and Work 
creation process = “Inventory status change”) and include it in the mobile device 
menu. 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
333 
If you want to be able to change the status when registering an inbound arrival or a 
put-away movement, set the slider Display disposition code in applicable mobile 
device menu items to “Yes”. If the location selected for the put away of the 
received items is depending on the disposition code, you can additionally create a 
location directive with the applicable disposition code. 
Changing the inventory status for blocking or unblocking inventory generates an 
inventory transaction. You can execute inventory status changes on the mobile 
devices portal or in the Dynamics AX client. 
On the mobile device, you have got following options to change the status: 
 Separate transaction – Execute a menu item for “Inventory status change” 
 Together with a movement – Register an arrival or a put-away in an 
appropriate menu item (Display disposition code = “Yes”) and select the required 
code in the Disposition code field which displays then. 
In the Dynamics AX client, you got following options 
 Inventory status change – Menu item Warehouse management> Periodic tasks> 
Inventory status change with flexible filtering options 
 Warehouse status change – Menu item Warehouse management> Periodic tasks> 
Warehouse status change for blocking/unblocking on warehouse level 
 On-hand inquiry – Button Inventory status change in the on-hand inquiry by 
location (Warehouse management> Inquiries and reports> On hand by location) 
 Quality order – Automatically changing the inventory status from a quality 
order if specified in the test group (Inventory management> Setup> Quality 
control> Test groups, slider Update inventory status on the tab General) 
On a license plate, a mixed inventory status with inventory partly blocked and 
partly unblocked is not possible. If you want to block a partial quantity of a license 
plate, move the required quantity to another license plate and block it there. For 
locations, you can specify in the location profile whether a mixed inventory status 
is allowed. 
8.1.4.2 Movements and Adjustments 
Movements and adjustments are manual transaction in inventory. Apart from 
registering these transactions on a mobile device as shown in this section, you can 
use regular inventory journals (see section 7.4.2) entering all required inventory 
dimensions manually. 
Movements are used for manual transfers between locations. As a prerequisite for 
registering movements on a mobile device, set up a mobile device menu item with 
the required settings (Mode = “Work”, Use existing work = “No”, and Work creation 
process = “Movement”) and include it in the mobile device menu. On the mobile 
device, you can execute movements using this menu item afterwards. 

334 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
You can use location directives to suggest the put location in a movement. In this 
case, following setup is required: 
 Mobile device menu item for creating work – Use existing work = “No”, Work 
creation process = “Movement by template”, Create movement = “Yes” 
 Work template and location directives – For the work order type “Inventory 
movement” 
 Mobile device menu item for executing work – Use existing work = “Yes”, work 
class for inventory movement 
Whereas movements are used for transfers, adjustments are used for manually 
increasing or reducing the quantity on hand. They generate inventory transactions 
through inventory counting journals. The journal name used for this transaction is 
specified in the adjustment type (Warehouse management> Setup> Inventory> 
Adjustment types). 
Following setup is required for registering adjustments on the mobile device: 
 Adjustment types – For grouping purposes, specify the inventory journal name 
 Mobile device menu item – Use existing work = “No”, Work creation process = 
“Adjustment in” (or “Adjustment out”) 
In order to record an adjustment on the mobile device, select the menu item for 
“Adjustment in” or “Adjustment out” and enter the transaction quantity by which 
you want to change inventory. The quantity is always a positive number, for 
increasing the inventory quantity select “Adjustment in” and for reducing 
“Adjustment out”. 
 
Figure 8-16: Adjustment on the mobile device (reducing the quantity by one piece) 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
335 
8.1.4.3 Inventory Counting 
Counting is used to audit the on-hand quantity of items, generating inventory 
transactions for discrepancies. The advanced warehouse management supports 
following strategies for counting: 
 Planned counting – Periodical counting (e.g. annual stocktaking) 
 Threshold counting – Counting when inventory reaches the threshold limit 
 Spot counting – Ad-hoc counting on the mobile device 
Following setup is required for executing inventory counting on mobile devices: 
 Location profile – In the location profile of all locations included in counting, 
set the slider Allow cycle counting to “Yes” 
 Parameters – Enter a default adjustment type and a default work class on the 
tab Cycle counting in the warehouse management parameters. If the checkbox 
Remove reservations is selected in the settings of the default adjustment type, 
reservations in sales orders (and other issue transactions) do not block counting. 
 Unit sequence group – Controls the available units for counting 
Planned counting is used to create and execute counting work periodically. In 
addition to the general setup for counting on the mobile device, following setup is 
required for planned counting: 
 Mobile device menu item for cycle counting – Use existing work = “Yes”, work 
class for cycle counting; Button Cycle counting in the action pane for additional 
settings (e.g. how often to re-count if there is a discrepancy). 
 Warehouse worker – In the work user, select if the worker is a supervisor or 
which counting discrepancy does not require approval. 
 Cycle count plan – Basis for planned cycle counting, with filter on items and 
locations (Warehouse management> Setup> Cycle counting> Cycle count plans). 
In order to execute planned counting, you have to generate counting work first. 
You can create work based on cycle count plans through the menu item Warehouse 
management> Cycle counting> Cycle count scheduling or by clicking the button Process 
cycle counting plan in the cycle count plan form. If you want to create counting 
work independently from cycle count plans, choose the periodic activity Warehouse 
management> Cycle counting> Cycle count work by location or Warehouse management> 
Cycle counting> Cycle count work by item. 
Once the planned counting work is created, you can execute counting on the 
mobile device using the menu item which is set up for cycle counting. After 
entering the quantity (including “0”) in all counting units for an item and location, 
you have to confirm the quantity in case of discrepancies (depending on the 
settings for the menu item). Depending on settings in the work user, discrepancies 
between the counted quantity and the current quantity in Dynamics AX are posted 
immediately to adjust inventory. The work form (Warehouse management> Work> 
Warehouse> Cycle count work pending review) shows discrepancies which are not 

336 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
posted immediately. Click the button WORK/WORK/Cycle counting to access the 
cycle counting review form and click the button Accept count there to post the 
inventory adjustment if applicable. 
 
Figure 8-17: Cycle counting settings in the mobile device menu item 
Unlike planned counting, threshold counting is a strategy to execute counting 
automatically when inventory reaches the threshold limit. As a prerequisite for 
threshold counting, you have to set up a cycle counting threshold (Warehouse 
management> Setup> Cycle counting> Cycle count threshold). The buttons Select items 
and Select locations provide the option to specify filter criteria for the threshold. 
Registering an outbound transaction on the mobile device (e.g. picking) then 
triggers threshold counting if the quantity on the location reaches the cycle 
counting threshold. If the slider Process cycle counting immediately in the cycle 
counting threshold is set to “No”, Dynamics AX generates cycle counting work 
which has to be executed later on the mobile device like regular planned counting 
work. If this slider is set to “Yes”, a counting dialog displays immediately when 
registering the outbound transaction. 
Spot counting is an ad-hoc counting on the mobile device. As a prerequisite for 
spot counting, create a mobile device menu item with the required settings (Mode = 
“Work”, Use existing work = “No”, and Work creation process = “Spot cycle 
counting”). The button Cycle counting in the mobile device menu item provides 
access to the additional counting parameters. After finishing the setup, you can 
execute spot counting using the menu item for spot counting (similar to periodic 
cycle counting, but you are free to choose the location). Posting and resolving 
discrepancies works like for periodic counting. 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
337 
8.1.4.4 Replenishment 
The target of replenishment within the warehouse is to move required items from 
buffer locations to picking locations in order to achieve short ways in the picking 
process. Dynamics AX supports two basic strategies for replenishing locations: 
 Based on minimum/maximum quantities – Using minimum and maximum 
stocking limits on location level 
 Based on demand – Replenishment of missing quantity on picking locations, 
triggered by the picking process for outbound orders 
Minimum/maximum replenishment applies if you want to fill a location to the 
maximum once the current quantity is below minimum. For using minimum/ 
maximum replenishment, following setup is required: 
 Replenishment template – Replenishment type “Minimum or maximum”, 
template details lines with the min/max quantity, filter on items and locations 
(Warehouse management> Setup> Replenishment> Replenishment templates) 
 Work template and location directives – For the work order type 
“Replenishment” 
 Fixed locations for items – required if you want to refill empty locations 
(Warehouse management> Setup> Warehouse> Fixed locations) 
 Mobile device menu item for replenishment – Use existing work = “Yes”, work 
class for replenishment 
In order to process minimum/maximum replenishment, run the replenishment 
batch job (Warehouse management> Replenishment> Replenishments) which generates 
the replenishment work. In the warehouse, execute the replenishment on the 
mobile device using the menu item for replenishment. 
Whereas minimum/maximum replenishment refills locations independently from 
current picking processes, wave demand replenishment applies if you want to 
refill a location when processing a wave. Replenishment is only created if there is 
no quantity available on the location selected by the location directive for picking. 
If you want to use wave demand replenishment, following setup is required: 
 Replenishment template – With the Replenishment type “Wave demand” and a 
Wave step code 
 Wave template – With the additional method “replenish” and the wave step 
code of the replenishment template 
 Work template and location directives for replenishment – For the work order 
type “Replenishment” (Match “Put” locations in the replenishment location 
directive with “Pick” locations in the sales order picking location directive) 

338 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
 Work template and location directives for picking – For the work order type 
“Sales orders” (only if you want settings different from regular picking)  
 Mobile device menu item for replenishment – Use existing work = “Yes”, work 
class for replenishment (often the same menu item as for minimum/maximum 
replenishment) 
 
Figure 8-18: Setting up a wave demand replenishment template 
If the wave template for the sales order shipments is set to automatically release 
waves, set the slider Automate replenishment work release in the wave template to 
“Yes” (replenishment has to be released and executed before sales picking). 
In order to execute wave replenishment, create the shipment, the load, and the 
wave for sales order picking (applying the wave template for replenishment), 
assign the sales order, process the wave, and release the wave (depending on 
settings in the wave template, the steps are executed automatically or manually). If 
no quantity is available on the picking location, a replenishment wave with 
replenishment work is created when processing the sales order wave. On the 
mobile device in the warehouse, execute the replenishment work before picking 
and loading. 
Apart from the wave demand replenishment, the load demand replenishment is 
another type of demand replenishment. The difference between these two types is 
that wave demand is processed automatically through the wave template whereas 
load demand replenishment has to be calculated through a batch job. 
8.1.4.5 Warehouse Inquiries 
You can use inquiries on the mobile devices portal to show the current quantity in 
inventory. In order to set up an inquiry for mobile devices, create a menu item 
with the Mode “Indirect”. In an inquiry on the item quantity for example, select the 

8.1  Advanced Warehouse Management 
339 
Activity code “Item inquiry” in the mobile device menu item. On the mobile device, 
you can access the inquiry in the appropriate menu item. In case of an item 
inquiry, enter/scan the item number to view the quantity on the different locations. 
In the Dynamics AX client, the on-hand inquiry by location (Warehouse 
management> Inquiries and reports> On hand by location) is one of the main pages for 
viewing the current inventory in the advanced warehouse management. After 
selecting a warehouse and refreshing the page, the inquiry shows the locations 
with the item quantities. The button Inventory status change provides the option to 
change the inventory status. 
8.1.5 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 8.1 – Warehouse Setup 
In order to investigate the options for warehouse setup, create a new location 
format L-## (## = your user ID) with two segments: A segment with a length of one 
digit, followed by the separator “-” and a 3-digit segment. 
Then set up a location profile F-## for floor locations and a location profile B-## for 
bulk locations. Both location profiles refer to the new location format L-## and 
allow cycle counting, but only floor locations use license plate tracking. Accept the 
default settings in the other fields of the location profile form. 
After the basic setup is done, create a new warehouse WH-## which applies 
advanced warehouse management processes. This warehouse has got the receiving 
location “RECV”, the shipping location “SHIP”, three floor locations (“F-001” to 
“F-003”), and six bulk locations (“1-001” to “2-003). Floor locations and bulk 
locations refer to the appropriate location profiles created before. The location 
“RECV” is the Default receipt location in your warehouse. 
Exercise 8.2 – Work Template, Location Directive and Wave Template 
You want to process the purchase put-away work for your new warehouse WH-## 
separately. Create a new work class PO-## (## = your user ID) for this purpose. 
Then create a new work template for purchase orders, which only refers to your 
warehouse and this work class. In addition, enter a sales order work template 
which only applies to your warehouse and only includes one pair of pick and put 
work (no staging). This work template refers to an existing sales order work class. 
In order to use the warehouse in purchasing and sales, related location directives 
are required. Create a location directive for your warehouse WH-##, which 
specifies to put purchase order receipts to bulk locations in case of full pallets and 
to floor locations otherwise. Then enter another location directive for sales picking 
which should pick full pallets from bulk locations. Other units should be picked 
from floor locations first, and in second line from bulk locations (if all floor 
locations are empty). The sales order put location directive should direct to the 
location “SHIP”. 

340 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
Finally set up a wave template “T-##” for your warehouse WH-## which does not 
apply any automatic action. 
Exercise 8.3 – Mobile Device Menu and Work User 
A new mobile device menu for executing warehouse work in the following 
exercises is required. Create following mobile device menu items for this purpose 
(select to generate license plates automatically): 
 Menu item ##-PO-Receive with the Work creation process “Purchase order line 
receiving” 
 Menu item ##-PO-Put (referring to the work class created in exercise 8.2 and 
Directed by = “User directed”) for putting the purchase receipt from the default 
receipt location to floor or bulk locations 
 Menu item ##-SO-Direct (referring to the sales order work class selected in 
exercise 8.2, and Directed by = “User grouping”) for sales order picking 
Then set up a new mobile device menu “##-Main” containing these menu items. In 
addition, the menu should include a menu item “About” and a menu item for 
logging off. 
In the warehouse worker form, create a new worker record who is linked to any 
worker employed in the current company. On the tab Work users of the warehouse 
worker form, enter a user with the User ID U##. Select the Menu name created 
before and the warehouse WH-## (created in exercise 8.1) for this user. 
Exercise 8.4 – Released Product for Advanced Warehouse Management 
In order to apply the advanced warehouse management for a product, you need an 
appropriate storage dimension group, reservation hierarchy, and unit sequence 
group. You can use an existing storage dimension group, but you want to create a 
new reservation hierarchy R-##, which does not contain tracking dimensions, and a 
unit sequence group U-##, which includes pieces and pallets (pallets as default unit 
for purchasing). 
Create an item I-##-W with the name “##-AdvWarehouseMgmt” in the released 
product form. It is a regular stocked product without variants or batch numbers, 
but you want to use the advanced warehouse processes. Select an item group 
which is appropriate for merchandise, and an item model group related to FIFO-
valuation. The item does not require approved vendors. The item sales tax groups 
for sales and for purchasing refers to the standard tax rate. The base purchase price 
and the base cost price is USD 50. The base sales price is USD 100. The unit of 
measure for the item is “Pieces” in all areas except purchasing. For purchasing, you 
want to apply pallets (1 pallet = 10 pieces) as default. Make sure to choose the same 
units of measurement which you have selected when creating the unit sequence 
before. Then assign the new item to the unit sequence group U-## and the 
reservation hierarchy R## created before.  

8.2  Transportation Management 
341 
Exercise 8.5 – Advanced Warehouse Management in Purchasing Processes 
You want to order 34 units of the item I-##-W (created in exercise 8.4) from any 
vendor (e.g. the vendor of exercise 3.2) to be received on your warehouse WH-## 
(created in exercise 8.1). Enter an appropriate purchase order and confirm it. Check 
the inventory transaction related to the purchase order line afterwards. 
Log on to the mobile devices portal using the credentials of the work user U-## 
(created in exercise 8.3) next. Access the menu item for receiving the purchase 
order and post the receipt for the complete quantity of your purchase order. Which 
status do the inventory transactions of your item show? Access the inquiry “On 
hand by location” in the warehouse management menu, filter on your warehouse 
WH-## and take a note of the license plate shown for the posted quantity. 
Then open the mobile device menu item for the put-away of the purchase receipt. 
Post the transaction there (refer to the license plate shown in the previous inquiry). 
Review the inventory transactions and the inquiry “On hand by location” for your 
warehouse WH-## again. What is different now? Finally post the product receipt 
for the purchase order based on the mobile device transactions registered before. 
Exercise 8.6 – Advanced Warehouse Management in Sales and Distribution 
A customer (e.g. your customer of exercise 4.1) orders 12 units of your item I-##-W, 
which you have purchased in the previous exercise. Enter an appropriate sales 
order to be shipped from your warehouse WH-##, reserve the quantity, and create 
the shipment. Which status do the inventory transactions of your item show? 
Then create a load for the shipment, and a wave choosing the wave template T-## 
created in exercise 8.2. Take a note of the Work ID generated when processing the 
wave, and release the wave. Check the inventory transactions of your item. What is 
different now? Review the inquiry “On hand by location” for your warehouse 
WH-## and take a note of the license plate shown for the floor location. 
In the next step, open the mobile device menu item for sales order picking (logged 
on as the work user U-## created in exercise 8.3). Post the picking transaction 
entering the work ID and – if picking from the floor location – the license plate 
noted before. 
Check the inventory transactions and the inquiry “On hand by location” for your 
warehouse WH-## again. What is different now? Finally, post the packing slip for 
the sales order based on the mobile device transactions registered before. 
8.2 
Transportation Management 
Transportation management in Dynamics AX is based on the advanced warehouse 
management. It is primarily used to select external freight carriers for inbound and 
outbound shipments, and to manage these inbound and outbound shipments. 

342 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
Based on the load (e.g. a truck load), the origin address, and the destination 
address, Dynamics AX calculates possible transportation routes with their costs. 
After creating a route based on the rate calculation (or manually, independent from 
calculated rates), you can record the agreement as transportation tender. Managing 
dock appointments for loading the truck and reconciling the freight invoice with 
the route are additional options in the transportation management. 
 
Figure 8-19: Overview of the transportation management functionality in Dynamics AX 
8.2.1 
Core Setup for Transportation Management 
Before starting to use transportation management processes, you have to complete 
the setup for transportation management. 
8.2.1.1 Transportation Management Parameters 
Transportation management parameters (Transportation management> Setup> 
Transportation management parameters) contain basic settings like the number 
sequences in the transportation management module. The button Initialize base 
engine data in the toolbar of the sub-tab Engines on the tab General in the parameters 
provides the option to initialize engine setup data for the available base engines. 
8.2.1.2 Transportation Methods and Shipping Carriers 
Transportation 
methods 
(Transportation 
management> 
Setup> 
Carriers> 
Transportation methods) represent the different kinds of transport. The 
transportation method is a required field in the shipping carrier service. 
In order to set up an active shipping carrier, open the form Transportation 
management> Setup> Carriers> Shipping carriers and insert a carrier with the sliders 
Activate shipping carrier and Activate carrier rating set to “Yes”. On the tab Services in 
the shipping carrier form, enter the carrier service. 

8.2  Transportation Management 
343 
 
Figure 8-20: Entering a carrier with his service 
8.2.1.3 Rate Base Types and Rate Engines 
Rate base types (Transportation management> Setup> General> Rate base type) 
determine the lookup criteria for calculating the rates of a shipping carrier. These 
lookup criteria are fields which are relevant for the transport – for example the 
postal code of the destination address. They are used as parameters for the rate 
engines and have to match the internal requirements of rate engines. Primary rate 
base types are generated when initializing the base engine data in the parameters. 
Engines provide the calculation routines for transportation routes in Dynamics AX. 
Rate engines (Transportation management> Setup> Engines> Rate engine) are the basic 
engines for calculating transportation costs. They can refer to sub-engines like the 
mileage engines. 
Mileage engines (Transportation management> Setup> Engines> Mileage engine) 
determine the distance between origin and destination addresses, usually based on 
postal codes. You can enter the distance between the postal codes of the relevant 
origin and destination locations on the tab Details of the mileage engines. The 
button Metadata provides access to the definition of available and mandatory fields 
for entering distances. By adding or removing fields you can control the columns 
shown in the mileage engines. The field selection has to match the requirements of 
the engine. 

344 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
 
Figure 8-21: Entering distances in the mileage engine  
Transit time engines (Transportation management> Setup> Engines> Transit time 
engine) determine the time required for the transport between addresses. The setup 
is similar to the mileage engine, except that you have to enter days (instead of 
miles in the mileage engine) and that the transit time is depending on the carrier 
service. 
8.2.1.4 Break Masters, Rate Masters and Rating Profiles 
Break masters, rate masters and rating profiles are the basis for calculating the 
price of a transport. 
 
Figure 8-22: Setting up a break master 

8.2  Transportation Management 
345 
Break masters (Transportation management> Setup> Rating> Break master) determine 
the steps (intervals) and the unit (e.g. miles) for different rate prices. 
 
Figure 8-23: Setting up a rate master 
 
Figure 8-24: Setting up a rate base 
Rate masters (Transportation management> Setup> Rating> Rate master) give the 
pricing structure of the carriers. When creating a rate master, select the Rating 
metadata ID (determining the columns on the tab Rate base assignment) on the tab 
Overview. The tab Rate base assignment contains the assignment of Rate bases to 
addresses.  
Before entering a rate base assignment, click the button Rate base and enter rate 
bases. Rate bases contain the pricing of the rate master applying the steps 

346 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
(intervals) for prices as specified in the Break master selected on the tab General. 
After creating a new rate base, you can enter the prices on the tab Details. 
Once you have finished the setup of the rate base, open the tab Rate base assignment 
in the rate master and assign the rate master to address relations based on columns 
like postal codes. This assignment makes the rate master available for calculating 
the transportation price from/to the applicable addresses. 
Rating profiles (Transportation management> Setup> Rating> Rating profile) link the 
shipping carrier with the Rate engine, the Rate master, and the Transit time engine. 
The rating profile therefore controls the applicable prices and the transport times. 
As an alternative to creating rating profiles from the menu, you can enter the rating 
profile of a carrier on the tab Rating profiles in the shipping carrier form. 
8.2.1.5 Settings in the Released Products 
In the released product detail form, the slider Use transportation management 
processes on the tab Transportation controls whether the item uses transportation 
management. This slider is always set to “Yes”, if the advanced warehouse 
management applies to the item. If activating transportation management for a 
product not applying the advanced warehouse management, loads are not 
available for the item. 
8.2.1.6 Checking the Rate Calculation 
You can check the transportation rates, which are calculated according to the 
transportation setup, in the rate route workbench (Transportation management> 
Planning> Rate route workbench). After entering a From-address and a To-address on 
the tab Criteria, click the button Rate shop to view available transports with the 
related price on the tab Route results. Deselecting the checkbox Hide Exceptions 
shows transport options which are not available with the selected settings. For 
these transports, clicking the button View exception details gives an indication on 
missing setup details. 
8.2.2 
Managing Transportation Processes 
Transportation management in Dynamics AX applies to inbound and to outbound 
processes. Apart from sales orders, it also covers purchase and transfer orders. 
8.2.2.1 Core Transportation Process 
Starting point for the transportation process is a sales order (or purchase/transfer 
order) with a product which is enabled for transportation management. 
The next step is planning the transport. For this purpose, open the load planning 
workbench from the menu (Transportation management> Planning> Load planning 
workbench) or by clicking the button WAREHOUSE/Loads/Load planning workbench 
in the action pane of the sales order. In the load planning workbench, select the 
appropriate order line on the tab Sales lines and add it to a new load (button 

8.2  Transportation Management 
347 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND/Add/To new load in the action pane) or to an existing load. 
The load then shows on the tab Loads of the load planning workbench. 
 
Figure 8-25: Adding a sales order line to a new load in the load planning workbench 
In order to calculate the transportation price, select the appropriate load in the load 
planning workbench and click the button Rating and routing/Rate route workbench in 
the toolbar of the tab Loads providing access to the rate route workbench. 
 
Figure 8-26: Selecting a route in the rate route workbench 
In the rate route workbench, click the button Rate shop to calculate available 
options and prices for the transport (clicking the button Rate just shows the least 

348 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
expensive transport). Once you have decided on the transport, select the 
appropriate line and click the button Assign on the tab Route results. Assigning 
creates a route and links this route, which you can view in the form Transportation 
Management> Planning> Routes, to the load. 
If you want to create a route with a manual price (instead of calculating the price in 
the rate route workbench), click the button Rating and routing/Manual rating in the 
toolbar of the tab Loads in the load planning workbench. 
In order to initiate picking in the warehouse, select the load in the load planning 
workbench and create the shipment by clicking the button Release/Release to 
warehouse in the toolbar of the tab Loads. Once all warehouse processes are finished 
and the items are on the final shipping location of the warehouse, you can confirm 
the shipment and the load (see section 8.1.2). The confirmation tells the carrier that 
the load has been shipped. The load status changes to “Shipped” and by default 
the load does not show in the load planning workbench any more. 
8.2.2.2 Transportation Tenders 
A transportation tender is an agreement with a carrier on a specific transport. It 
includes the transportation date and the rate. In the shipping carrier form, the 
lookup field Transportation tenders on the tab Overview controls whether 
transportation tenders are updated manually or through EDI. 
In order to access the transportation tenders, click the button Transportation tenders 
after selecting the appropriate route in the route form (Transportation Management> 
Planning> Routes), or the button TRANSPORTATION/Transportation tenders in the 
load form (Transportation Management> Planning> Loads> All loads). Clicking the 
button New in the transportation tenders creates a new tender. Once the tender is 
submitted to the carrier or confirmed by the carrier, update the status by clicking 
the button Update status. If you want to view all existing transportation tenders, 
open in the form Transportation management> Planning> Transportation tenders. 
8.2.2.3 Warehouse Appointments 
Warehouse appointments ensure an organized handling of trucks at the dock by 
scheduling the date and time for loading the truck. 
As a prerequisite for using warehouse appointments, you have to create 
appointment rules (Transportation management> Setup> Appointment scheduling> 
Appointment rules). An appointment rule represents a warehouse dock. 
In order to access the appointment schedule, click the button Transportation/ 
Appointment scheduling on the tab Loads in the load planning workbench after 
selecting the appropriate load. In the appointment scheduling form, create the 
appointment (assigned to an Appointment rule) with start/end time and confirm it 
by clicking the button Update status/Firm. Existing appointments show in the form 
Transportation management> Dock appointment scheduling> Appointment scheduling. 

8.2  Transportation Management 
349 
When the truck arrives, register the driver check-in and check-out in the form 
Transportation management> Dock appointment scheduling> Driver check-in and check-
out. Alternatively, you can register the check-in/check-out in the appointment form 
or on a warehouse mobile device (select an appropriate mobile device menu item). 
8.2.2.4 Transportation Constraints 
Transportation constraints restrict available options for transportation, for example 
preventing that a particular carrier transports a particular item number. 
In order to set up constraints based on items or carriers, open the menu item 
Transportation management> Setup> Routing> Constraints and enter the disallowed 
combinations of items, shipments, and carriers. The field Constraint action controls 
whether to create a warning or an error. 
When calculating routes in the rate route workbench, a constraint which is 
applicable to a transport generates an exception (shown in the column Constraints). 
8.2.2.5 Segmented Transports 
Segmented transports apply if you want to change the carrier within a transport. 
Hub masters for this purpose represent the hubs where you can switch carrier. 
As a prerequisite to use segmented transports, following setup is required: 
 Hub types – Different types of hubs, e.g. harbors, airports (Transportation 
management> Setup> Routing> Hub types) 
 Hub masters – Places with address (e.g. different harbors) for switching 
between carriers (Transportation management> Setup> Routing> Hub masters) 
 Route plans – Sequence of transports from the origin to the first destination 
hub, from the first hub to the next hub, and between all following hubs 
(Transportation management> Setup> Routing> Route plans); Enter the rate per 
segment on the tab Details in spot rates if applicable (button Spot rates) 
 Route guide – With Origin and Destination address selection; Enter the route 
plan on the tab Result (Transportation management> Setup> Routing> Route guides) 
In order to calculate the rates using segmented transports, click the button Route 
with rate in the rate route workbench. After selecting a route on the tab Route 
results, switch to the tab Segments to view the transport segments with their rate. 
8.2.2.6 Freight Discounts 
Rate engines calculate the base rate for transportation as described above. Freight 
discounts (Transportation management> Setup> Rating> Discounts) allow adjusting 
this base rate. They available in both directions, the rate paid to the carrier 
(Discount type “Shipper”) and the rate charged to the customer (Discount type 
“Customer”). When setting up a freight discount, select the Discount type and the 
start/end date (on the tab Dates). Additional fields in the discounts form are 
available to restrict the discount, e.g. for a particular Shipper carrier. In order to 
enter the discount value, switch to the tab Discount, select the Result type 

350 
8  Warehouse and Transportation Management 
(“Percentage” or “Amount”) and enter the percentage or rate. Positive discounts 
reduce the freight rate, and negative discounts increase the rate. 
When calculating a rate in the rate route workbench, the amounts in the columns 
Customer rate and Shipper rate deduct the discount from the base rate shown in the 
column Total rate. 
8.2.2.7 Charging Freight to the Customer 
If you want to charge the customer a freight rate which is different from the actual 
base rate calculated by the rate engine, there are following options: 
 Freight discount – For the Discount type “Customer” (as described before) 
 Override charges – Customer rate independent from the actual transport 
Override charges (Transportation management> Setup> Rating> Override charges) 
provide the option to enter a fixed price or to apply the charges of a fixed carrier, 
independently from the selected route. For a fixed price, set the slider Manual on 
the tab Charge of the override charges form to “Yes” and enter the price on the tab 
Charge manual rates which shows then. If the charges of a fixed carrier always 
apply, no matter which carrier does the actual transport (e.g. the customer pays 
only truck charges), select the Shipping carrier on the tab Charge. When calculating 
the freight rate for the customer in the rate route workbench then, the Customer rate 
shows the rate as specified in the override charges. 
If you want to include transportation costs in the sales order, following setup is 
required: 
 Charges code – Set up a charges code (Accounts receivable> Charges setup> 
Charges code) with the posting type combination Customer – Ledger (for adding 
charges to the order total) or Ledger – Ledger (for internal posting). 
 Charges 
assignment 
– 
Create 
a 
miscellaneous 
charges 
assignment 
(Transportation management> Setup> Rating> Miscellaneous charges) with a start 
date, linking the charges code in accounts receivable to freight charges in 
transportation management. 
 Delivery terms – Create delivery terms (Sales and marketing> Setup> 
Distribution> Terms of delivery) with the slider Add transportation charges to orders 
set to “Yes”. 
In order to generate charges in the sales order with this setup, enter a sales order, 
create the load, calculate the rate, and create/assign the route. Then create the 
shipment (“Release to warehouse”) and execute the warehouse processes. When 
confirming the shipment, the freight charges are added as miscellaneous charges to 
the sales order line.

Financial Management 
The primary responsibility of finance administration is to control and to analyze all 
value-based transactions of an enterprise. These transactions occur in business 
processes all over the organization, including transactions within the enterprise 
and transactions with external parties. 
Finance management therefore is the core area of business management solutions. 
In Dynamics AX, a deep integration of business processes in all areas with finance 
grants accurate financial figures which are immediately available. 
9.1 
Principles of Ledger Transactions 
Before we start to go into details, the lines below show the principles of ledger 
transactions. 
9.1.1 
Basic Approach 
The core task of finance is to manage accounts in the general ledger as basis for the 
balance sheet and the income statement (profit and loss statement). In addition to 
the general ledger, accounting keeps subledgers like accounts receivable, accounts 
payables, fixed assets, projects, and inventory. These subledgers contain detailed 
data which support particular parts of the general ledger. Inventory management 
for example includes inventory transactions, which contain the details of changes 
in stock account balances. 
Whenever reporting a value-based transaction in a subledger, for example an 
invoice in sales or a counting difference in inventory, there is a transaction in the 
general ledger. If you post a sales order invoice, it has includes following areas: 
 Inventory – Financial value (in the transaction and the on-hand quantity) 
 Accounts receivable – Customer debt (customer transaction) 
 General ledger – Stock account, revenue account, COGS account (cost of goods 
sold), customer summary account 
Ledger integration, which is a core characteristic of Dynamics AX, provides 
traceability of all financial vouchers back to the origin in other modules. 
Depending on settings for subledger batch transfer, subledger transactions are 
immediately posted to the general ledger. 
The voucher principle is the general principle for processing transactions in 
Dynamics AX: Throughout the whole application, you have to register a voucher 
before you can post it. After posting, it is not possible to modify a voucher any 
more. If you want to cancel a transaction, you have to post a reversing transaction.

9.1.2 
At a Glance: Ledger Journal Transactions 
In order to record a manual ledger transaction in Dynamics AX, you have to 
register a journal. The lines below show how to post a single-line transaction. 
After accessing the form General ledger> Journal entries> General journals, create a 
journal header by clicking the button New (or pressing the shortcut key Alt+N). 
Alternatively, you can access the General journal processing workspace and create a 
journal header by clicking the tile New journal there. In the journal list page, select a 
journal name for the new journal in the column Name and optionally enter a text 
explaining the transaction in the column Description. If sales tax (VAT) applies, the 
slider Amounts include sales tax on the tab Setup of the journal header controls 
whether the debit (or credit) amount in the journal lines includes tax. 
In order to switch to the journal lines, click the Journal batch number shown as link 
in the grid of the journal list page or click the button Lines in the action pane. When 
registering a simple ledger transaction in the journal lines, leave the default option 
“Ledger” in the column Account type and select the account number including 
financial dimensions in the column Account (using segmented entry control). If you 
want to post to a subledger, choose a different account type and enter the related 
account number – for example “Vendor” in the Account type and the vendor 
number in the Account for accounts payable.  
 
Figure 9-1: 
Registering a journal line (related to an account structure without dimensions) 
In a single-line transaction, you can enter the account and the offset account 
(including applicable financial dimensions) in the one common journal line. Once 
you have finished registering the line, post the journal by clicking the button Post 
in the action pane of the journal header or lines (in a narrow screen, click the 
button 
 to view all buttons of the action pane). 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
353 
9.2 
Core Setup for Finance 
Since finance management in Dynamics AX contains core settings of the 
application, you have to complete the basic finance configuration before setting up 
other modules and before posting a transaction in any part of the application. 
This basic configuration includes the following elements: 
 Fiscal and ledger calendar – Specifying financial periods 
 Currencies and exchange rates – Specifying monetary units 
 Chart of accounts – Specifying ledger accounts 
Charts of accounts, fiscal calendars, and currencies/exchange rates are shared 
across companies in Dynamics AX. In order to use a shared calendar or chart of 
accounts in a company, select the appropriate chart of accounts and fiscal calendar 
in the ledger form. But if applicable, you can keep a separate chart of accounts or 
fiscal calendar at company level by choosing a different assignment per company. 
9.2.1 
Fiscal and Ledger Calendar 
The primary purpose of fiscal calendars is to determine the fiscal year, specifying 
the start date and the end date of financial periods within the fiscal year. The 
ledger calendar, which is based on the fiscal calendar, then controls at company 
level which financial periods are open for transactions. 
9.2.1.1 Fiscal Calendar 
Fiscal calendars are shared across all companies within a common Dynamics AX 
database. The field Fiscal calendar in the ledger form (General ledger> Ledger setup> 
Ledger) then determines the applicable fiscal calendar for a company. You have to 
select it during the initial company setup. 
Within the fiscal years of a fiscal calendar, the accounting periods are defined with 
their start date and end date. The length of the individual periods is depending on 
the reporting requirements of the company. 
In order to edit the fiscal calendars, open the form General ledger> Calendars> Fiscal 
calendars. If you want to create a new fiscal calendar, click the button New calendar 
and enter the calendar identification and applicable settings for the first fiscal year 
(start date, end date, name, period length, and unit – be sure to select the unit 
“Months” in case of monthly periods). 
If you want to add a fiscal year to an existing fiscal calendar, select the particular 
calendar in the left pane of the form before clicking the button New year in the 
action pane. A drop-down window then provides the option to simply copy the 
settings from the last year (slider Copy from last fiscal year set to “Yes”) or to edit the 
end date, period length, and unit for the new year. Clicking the button Create then 
creates the new year with its accounting periods. 

354 
9  Financial Management 
9.2.1.2 Closing and Opening Periods 
Apart from regular operating periods showing the Type “Operating”, there are two 
particular period types which you can’t use when posting a regular transaction: 
Closing periods and Opening periods. Dynamics AX provides the option to attach 
multiple closing periods to each regular operating period. 
Closing periods contain period-end or year-end transactions. Registration and 
posting of these transactions is only possible through closing sheets (General ledger> 
Period close> Closing sheet). 
Opening periods contain the opening transactions for a fiscal year. After closing 
the previous year, you can create these transactions in the form General ledger> 
Period close> Year end close based on the closing transactions. 
9.2.1.3 Ledger Calendar 
As a prerequisite for posting a transaction in Dynamics AX, the posting date of the 
transaction has to be included in an applicable ledger period with the period status 
“Open”. The required period status is controlled at company level in the ledger 
calendar, not in the shared fiscal calendar. 
 
Figure 9-2: 
Managing the period status in the ledger calendar 
The ledger calendar (General ledger> Period close> Ledger calendar) is based on the 
periods of the fiscal calendar, which is assigned to the particular company (selected 
in the ledger form). 
After selecting a fiscal year and a period in the left pane of the ledger calendar 
form, the Legal entities pane on the right-hand side shows all assigned companies 
with the period status. You can open or close periods for companies individually in 
the column Period status, or in common by clicking the button Update period status 
after selecting the appropriate companies. 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
355 
The period status “Open” enables posting of transactions in the period, whereas 
the period status “On hold” blocks posting. The status “Closed” also blocks 
posting – but unlike periods on hold, closed periods do not provide the option for 
reopening. For this reason, use the status “Closed” only if a period is definitely 
closed in accounting (i.e. after reporting to the authorities). 
The button Update module access and the related columns provide the option of a 
module-specific blocking of transactions and to exclude user groups from blocking. 
In order to support period closing, the Financial period close workspace shows a list 
of tasks which you can set up in the form General ledger> Period close> Financial 
period close configuration. 
9.2.1.4 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Apart from the browser-based user interface, items which are new in financial 
calendar administration include the period close workspace, the access to ledger 
calendars, and the option to close periods in multiple companies in parallel. 
9.2.2 
Currency and Exchange Rate 
All value-based transactions refer to currencies – general ledger transactions as 
well as subledger transactions like inventory or customer transactions. A 
transaction is always recorded in the accounting currency of the company, and 
sometimes additionally in a foreign currency. Currencies therefore are a main 
requirement before you can post any transaction in Dynamics AX. 
9.2.2.1 Currencies 
In order to facilitate currency management in multi-company organizations, the 
currency table is shared across all companies within a common Dynamics AX 
database. The currencies form (General ledger> Currencies> Currencies) shows all 
available currencies with currency code and name. After selecting a currency in the 
left pane, the tabs on the right-hand side show the related settings of the currency 
including the definition of the rounding precision on the tab Rounding rules. 
9.2.2.2 Exchange Rates 
Exchange rate types (General ledger> Currencies> Exchange rate types) in 
Dynamics AX provide the option to manage multiple exchange rates per currency 
in parallel. Different exchange rates are required for example, if you want to use 
other rates for budget entries than for current transactions. 
In order to access the Currency exchange rates form, choose the menu item General 
ledger> Currencies> Currency exchange rates or click the button Exchange rates in the 
Exchange rate types form. After selecting an Exchange rate type in the upper area of 
the left pane in the currency exchange rates form (see Figure 9-3), you can view the 
applicable currency relations in the lower left pane. If you need an additional 
relation (e.g. if working with a currency not used before), click the button New in 

356 
9  Financial Management 
the action pane provides and enter the details in the upper area of the right pane. 
The Conversion factor specifies the applicable factor for exchange rate calculation. 
The tab Add or remove exchange rates in the right pane shows the exchange rates for 
the currency relation selected in the left pane. The filter From date and To date 
determines the date range for which valid exchange rates are displayed. In order to 
enter an exchange rate for a new date, click the button Add in the toolbar of the tab. 
The column Exchange value then shows the conversion result, providing the option 
to check if the exchange rates are entered the right way. In daily business, you 
should enter or import new exchange rates continuously (usually at least once a 
month) in order to apply a correct conversion in foreign currency transactions. 
 
Figure 9-3: 
Managing exchange rates in the currency exchange rates form 
Currency exchange rates and exchange rate types are shared across all companies. 
If required, you can keep exchange rates at company level by choosing a different 
exchange rate type per company in the ledger form. 
9.2.2.3 Currency Settings in the Ledger Form 
The Accounting currency on tab Currency in the ledger form (General ledger> Ledger 
setup> Ledger) determines the home currency of the current company. This 
currency is used in all financial transactions. It is not possible to change the 
accounting currency selection of a company once transactions are registered. If you 
need to change the home currency later (e.g. converting to a new currency in your 
country), specific conversion tools are required. 
The Exchange rate type on the tab Currency in the ledger form determines the default 
exchange rate type for regular transactions. In addition, a separate default for 
budget transactions is available. 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
357 
The main accounts for exchange rate gains and losses in the current company are 
specified on the tab Accounts for currency revaluation in the ledger form. 
9.2.3 
Financial Dimensions 
In addition to the main accounts specified in the chart of accounts, financial 
dimensions (like cost center or department) provide further levels for structuring 
financial transactions. The financial dimensions which you have to enter in a 
transaction are depending on the account structures assigned to the current 
company. 
Based on the posted dimension values, financial analysis and reports are not only 
available at company level, but also at the level of financial dimensions. This is 
important in conjunction with the multisite functionality: Assigning a financial 
dimension to the inventory dimension “Site” (see section 10.1.5) for example makes 
it possible to report the income statement per subsidiary within a legal entity. 
9.2.3.1 Managing Financial Dimensions 
In Dynamics AX, financial dimensions and dimension values are shared across all 
companies within a common Dynamics AX database. 
Financial dimensions are not limited to standard dimensions like department, cost 
center and purpose. You can easily set up as many financial dimensions as 
required. But if you consider the impact on the structural clearness, the probability 
of wrong entries, and the effort for registration, do not set up more dimensions 
than really required. 
In order to set up a new financial dimension, open the form General ledger> Chart of 
accounts> Dimensions> Financial dimensions and insert a record by clicking the 
button New. The lookup field Use values from then specifies the origin of related 
financial dimension values: 
 <Custom dimension> – Creating a dimension not referring to other tables 
 One of the other options – Linking the dimension to other entities in the 
application (e.g. customers, item groups, or cost centers) 
If you select for example the option “Departments” in the lookup field Use values 
from, the financial dimension is linked to operating units of the type “Department”. 
In this case, all departments entered in the organization management (Organization 
administration> Organizations> Operating units) at the same time automatically apply 
as financial dimension values for the dimension. 
If you select the option “<Custom dimension>” in the lookup field Use values from, 
the financial dimension values have to be entered manually. 
After creating a new dimension, a system administrator (or a user with appropriate 
privilege) has to activate it by clicking the button Activate in the action pane. 

358 
9  Financial Management 
9.2.3.2 Financial Dimension Values 
You can access the dimension values of a financial dimension by clicking the 
button Financial dimension values in the financial dimensions. For custom 
dimensions, you have to create the Dimension values with Description manually. For 
other financial dimensions, you can edit dimension value details but you cannot 
create records (since the dimension values derive from other areas). 
After selecting a dimension value in the left pane of the form, you can edit the 
dimension value details in the right pane. The tab General in the right pane 
contains shared settings applicable to all companies using the dimension. The 
slider Suspended and the date fields Active from or Active to for example provide the 
option to block future transactions referring to the selected dimension value. On 
the tab Legal entity overrides, you can enter further blocking on company level. 
 
Figure 9-4: 
Managing dimension values for a financial dimension 
9.2.3.3 Applying Financial Dimensions 
After creating a financial dimension, it has to be included in account structures or 
in advanced rule structures which apply to the particular company, before you can 
use it in transactions and inquiries. Settings in the applicable account structure and 
advanced rule structure in addition specify, if and which dimension value is 
optional or required when posting to a particular account. 
In master data forms (for example the customer form or the released product 
form), the tab Financial dimensions shows all financial dimensions included in 
account structures and advanced rule structures which apply to the current 
company. Dimension values entered on this tab are used as default dimension 
values when registering an order or a journal line. 
When registering a transaction in a ledger journal line or in any other form 
containing a ledger account field, financial dimensions are not shown as separate 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
359 
fields. Using segmented entry control (see section 9.3.2), you have to enter financial 
dimensions together with the main account in one – segmented – field. 
9.2.3.4 Balancing Financial Dimension and Interunit Accounting 
Interunit accounting, an optional feature in Dynamics AX, ensures a balanced 
balance sheet for a selected financial dimension – the balancing dimension. 
Following settings are required as a prerequisite for interunit accounting: 
 Accounts for automatic transactions – Enter appropriate main accounts for the 
Posting type “Interunit-debit” and “Interunit-credit” in the accounts for 
automatic transactions (see section 9.2.4) 
 Balancing financial dimension – Selection in the ledger form 
If the field Balancing financial dimension in the ledger form is not empty, you have to 
provide a dimension value for this dimension when posting any transaction. If the 
from-value and the to-value for the balancing dimension are different in a 
transaction, Dynamics AX posts additional balancing transactions to the main 
accounts “Interunit-debit” and “Interunit-credit”. This applies for example in a 
transaction from one department to another, if departments are the balancing 
dimension. 
9.2.3.5 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Apart from the browser-based user interface, items which are new in financial 
dimension management include the dimension activation and changes in the way 
to edit company-specific dimension value details. 
9.2.4 
Account Structure and Chart of Accounts 
Account structures and charts of accounts determine the basic structure in finance. 
Account structures, charts of accounts, and main accounts are shared across 
companies in Dynamics AX. In a company, the chart of accounts selected in the 
ledger form determines the applicable main accounts. The assignment of account 
structures controls the applicable financial dimensions. 
9.2.4.1 Ledger Account and Main Account 
When entering a financial transaction, the ledger account field contains the main 
account and applicable financial dimensions. The account structure assigned at 
company and main account level controls the financial dimensions which are 
included in the ledger account. 
9.2.4.2 Charts of Accounts 
In order to access all charts of accounts in your enterprise, open the menu item 
General ledger> Chart of Accounts> Accounts> Chart of Accounts. Depending on the 
structure of your organization and the number of legal entities, the left pane in the 
chart of accounts form shows one or more charts of accounts. The right pane of the 
form contains the main accounts of the chart of accounts selected in the left pane. If 

360 
9  Financial Management 
you display the FactBox pane, it shows the ledgers and legal entities which use the 
selected chart of accounts. 
 
Figure 9-5: 
Managing charts of accounts (FactBox pane not shown) 
If you want to create a completely new chart of accounts, click the button New in 
the action pane. Clicking the button New or Edit in the toolbar of the tab Main 
accounts form opens the main accounts form, where you can insert or modify the 
main accounts of the selected chart of accounts as described further below. 
9.2.4.3 Settings in the Ledger Form 
Settings in the ledger form (General ledger> Ledger setup> Ledger) determine the chart 
of accounts and the account structures which are assigned to the current company. 
These settings are required before registering the first transaction. 
You can share a chart of accounts, assigning multiple companies to one common 
chart of accounts. After posting the first transaction in a company, it is not possible 
to change the chart of accounts assignment any more. 
The tab Account structures in the ledger form contains the account structures linked 
to the current company. In order to add an account structure, click the button Add 
in the toolbar of this tab. Since account structures determine the available financial 
dimensions when posting to a main account, each main account included in the 
chart of accounts has to be uniquely assigned to one account structure without 
overlapping or missing assignments. 
If you use interunit accounting, select the balancing financial dimension of the 
company in the ledger form. If selected, this dimension has to be included in all 
account structures of the company. 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
361 
9.2.4.4 Account Structures 
You can access the account structures list page through the menu item General 
ledger> Chart of Accounts> Structures> Configure account structures. If you want to 
access the related detail form, click the Name field of the appropriate account 
structure shown as link in the grid of the list page. Alternatively, you can access 
the account structure detail form from the ledger form (button Configure account 
structures on the tab Account structures). 
If you want to define a completely new segment combination consisting of main 
account and applicable financial dimensions, create a new account structure by 
clicking the button New in the action pane. In the Create drop-down window, the 
slider Add main account usually remains set to “Yes” in order to include the main 
account as the first segment. You can set this slider to “No” if you want to use a 
financial dimension, and not the main account, as first segment – e.g. if divisions 
apply and should be the first segment when entering transactions. After clicking 
the button Create, Dynamics AX shows the account structure detail form.  
 
Figure 9-6: 
Configuring an account structure in the detail form 
When creating a new account structure or editing an existing structure, it has got 
the status “Draft”. You can add dimensions to the account structure by clicking the 
button Add segment in the toolbar of the upper pane in the detail form. After 
selecting a segment field in the appropriate column of the upper pane, you can 
enter a filter expression in this field or on the tab Allowed value details. If you select 
the checkbox Blank values are allowed for a financial dimension, entering a 
dimension value is optional and you are not required to select a dimension value 
when registering a transaction for a main account referring to the account 
structure. 

362 
9  Financial Management 
The example in Figure 9-6 shows a simple account structure applying to main 
accounts starting with account 40000, containing the financial dimension 
“Department” without restricting available dimension values on this dimension. 
If applicable to your account structure, you can add one or more lines for a 
segment – including the main account – with appropriate filters which prevent 
overlapping definitions. This way you can specify multiple allowed dimension 
value combinations. 
Once you have finished the setup of account structure segments, click the button 
Activate to make the account structure available. If you want to edit an existing 
account structure later, click the button Edit in the action pane. The account 
structure status then changes to “Draft”, which also allows it to be deleted. 
9.2.4.5 Advanced Rule Structures 
Advanced rule structures are an optional setup which you can use, if you want to 
apply an additional financial dimension only when posting to one or a few specific 
main accounts. An example is the use of the financial dimension “Campaigns” in 
combination with a specific marketing main account in order to track campaigns. 
If you want to set up a new advanced rule structure, open the form General ledger> 
Chart of Accounts> Structures> Advanced rule structures and click the button New in 
the action pane. Then enter the applicable financial dimension(s) in a similar way 
to setting up an account structure as described above. 
In order to apply the advanced rule structure, open the account structures (General 
ledger> Chart of Accounts> Structures> Configure account structures) and click the 
button Advanced rule after selecting the appropriate account structure in Edit mode. 
In the Advanced rules form which shows after clicking this button, click the button 
New and enter an advanced rule ID and name in the Create drop-down window. In 
order to specify the main accounts, to which the new advanced rule applies, click 
the button Add new creteria on the tab Advanced rule criteria of the advanced rules. 
Clicking the button Add on the tab Advanced rule structures links advanced rule 
structures to the advanced rule. Activating the account structure, to which the 
advanced rule applies, activates the advanced rule in parallel. 
9.2.4.6 Main Accounts 
The structure and the format of the main accounts in the chart of accounts are only 
depending on the internal requirements of the company. In order to comply with 
the different reporting structures for balance sheet, income statement and other 
reports in finance, there are financial reports which you can set up in the 
Management Reporter independently from the structure of the chart of account. 
If you want to edit the main accounts, open the form General ledger> Chart of 
accounts> Accounts> Main accounts and click the button Edit there. Alternatively, 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
363 
you can access the main accounts from the chart of accounts form (button Edit in 
the toolbar of the tab Main accounts). 
The main accounts form shows the chart of accounts assigned to the current 
company. The name of this chart of accounts in shown in the header of the right 
pane. In case other companies are also assigned to this chart of accounts, you have 
to keep in mind that changes on main accounts also affect the other companies. 
If you want to enter a new account, click the button New in the action pane and 
enter a unique Main account number, a Name and a Main account type. In case a 
translation of the account name is required, click the button Name Translations. 
 
Figure 9-7: 
Editing a main account 
In the structure of the main accounts, you have to distinguish between transaction 
accounts and auxiliary accounts. The core difference between transaction accounts 
and auxiliary accounts is that you can only select a transaction account when 
registering a financial transaction. Auxiliary accounts support a clear structure of 
the chart of accounts, but they are not necessarily required. 
The Main account type, a lookup field in the main accounts form, groups accounts to 
transaction accounts and auxiliary accounts as shown in table 8-1 below.

 Total 
 Common (required in China) 
Transaction accounts include balance accounts on the one hand and nominal 
accounts (profit and loss accounts) on the other hand. In Dynamics AX, these two 
types work differently when closing a fiscal year: Whereas the balance of nominal 
accounts is zero in the opening transactions of the next year, balance accounts 
transfer their balance. 
Within the balance accounts, you can optionally further distinguish between asset 
accounts and liability accounts. You can use these subcategories for filtering and 
sorting purposes in reports. The same way you can subcategorize balance 
accounts, you can split nominal accounts (“Profit and loss” accounts) into expense 
accounts and revenue accounts. 
In addition to the main account type, the lookup field Main account category on the 
tab General of the main account form provides another classification of main 
accounts. Main account categories (General ledger> Chart of accounts> Accounts> 
Main accounts categories) are a basis for financial reports. 
When setting up a main account which receives transactions from other modules 
(e.g. a summary account for vendor liabilities), you should select the checkbox Do 
not allow manual entry in order to block manual transactions on this account. 
Further fields on the tabs General, Posting validation, and Financial reporting of the 
main accounts form provide the option to specify default value data and to enter 
restrictions for allowed transactions. On the tab Legal entity overrides, you can block 
a main account or enter default values for financial dimensions on company level. 
9.2.4.7 Trial Balance 
If you want to view the balances of main accounts, open the trial balance form 
(General ledger> Inquiries and reports> Trial balance). The button Parameters in the 
action pane of the trial balances provides the option to select the period used for 
calculating the account balances. 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
365 
In order to view the transactions of an account, click the button All transactions in 
the trial balance after selecting the appropriate main account. The transaction form 
contains following buttons which provide access to further details: 
 Voucher – Shows all general ledger transactions posted with selected voucher 
 Transaction origin – Shows the related transactions in all modules 
 Original document – Provides the option to reprint the document 
9.2.4.8 Accounts for Automatic Transactions 
Settings in the Accounts for automatic transactions apply to ledger transactions, 
which are posted automatically through ledger integration and for which there is 
no other setting (e.g. for invoice discounts). 
If you want to enter a new setting for automatic transactions, open the form General 
ledger> Posting setup> Accounts for automatic transactions and insert a record selecting 
the posting type and the assigned main account. Clicking the button Create default 
types generates a basic set of posting types, for which you can enter default 
accounts. Core settings in the accounts for automatic transactions include: 
 Error account – Applying in case of missing account settings 
 Penny difference in accounting currency – For small payment differences 
 Year-end result – Account for profit/loss when closing the fiscal year 
 Sales tax rounding 
 Order invoice rounding – Sales invoice rounding 
 Purchase invoice rounding-off – Purchase invoice rounding 
 Vendor invoice discount – Main account for purchase order total discounts 
 Customer invoice discount – Main account for sales order total discounts 
If the slider Interrupt in case or error account in the general ledger parameters is set 
to “Yes”, Dynamics AX displays an error message instead of posting to the error 
account when trying to post a transaction for which no main account is specified in 
the integration settings. 
9.2.4.9 Default Descriptions 
Default descriptions (General ledger> Journal setup> Default descriptions) determine a 
default text in transactions which are posted automatically through ledger 
integration. After selecting the transaction type in the field Description, you can 
enter the Language (“user” for a generic description) and the Text, which can 
include fixed variables (shown in the lower area of the right pane). 
9.2.4.10 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in main account management refer to the browser-based user 
interface, for example the main accounts form not showing account balances (use 
the trail balance) and the Management Reporter for financial statements. 

366 
9  Financial Management 
9.2.5 
Customer, Vendor, and Bank Account 
When entering a ledger journal line, you can – apart from a ledger account – select 
a customer, a vendor, a project, a bank account, or a fixed asset for the account and 
the offset account. 
9.2.5.1 Bank Accounts 
Before selecting a particular bank account in a transaction, you have to set it up in 
the form Cash and bank management> Bank accounts. When creating a new bank 
account by clicking the button New, enter the bank account ID, the Routing number 
identifying the bank, your Bank account number as specified by the bank, and a 
Name for the bank account. 
The field Main account, where you have to enter the main account assigned to the 
particular bank account, is another important setting on the tab General of the bank 
account form. The Currency field specifies the currency of the bank account. If you 
want to enable transactions in additional currencies, set the slider Allow transactions 
in additional currencies to “Yes”. The tab Additional identification contains the fields 
for SWIFT/BIC and IBAN. 
If a company has got multiple bank accounts at a particular bank, you can create a 
bank group (Cash and bank management> Setup> Bank groups) which contains general 
bank data like routing number, address, and contact information. Selecting the 
bank group in the related field on the tab General of bank accounts then applies 
these data as default for the bank account. 
9.2.5.2 Vendors 
As shown in section 3.2.1, you can manage vendor records in the list page Accounts 
payable> Vendors> All vendors. If you want to view vendor transactions (invoices 
and payments) there, click the button VENDOR/Transactions/Transactions in the 
action pane after selecting the particular vendor. Apart from the invoice or 
payment amount, the vendor transaction form shows the open, not yet settled 
amount in the column Balance. 
9.2.5.3 Settlement of Vendor Transactions 
If you want to apply a posted payment to an invoice, access the open vendor 
transactions by clicking the button INVOICE/Settle/Settle transactions in the action 
pane of the vendor form. 
In the Settle transactions dialog, select the checkbox Mark in the transaction lines 
which you want to clear. You can settle one or multiple invoices with one or 
multiple payments or credit notes. If there are transactions in foreign currencies, 
you can choose the settlement date (for calculating exchange rate gains or losses) in 
the lookup field Settlement posting date in the upper pane of the dialog. The lookup 
field Date used for calculating discounts determines the date for cash discount 
calculation with following options: 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
367 
 Transaction date – Select the transaction line containing the date for discount 
calculation and click the button Mark as primary payment in the toolbar. 
 Selected date – Enter the discount calculation date in the date field on the right. 
You can check the balance of the marked transactions in the Settlement balance 
fields at the bottom of the dialog. Clicking the button Post posts the settlement. 
If you do not want to post the settlements as a separate step, you can register the 
settlement already when entering a payment (see section 9.3.4). 
In case you have to cancel a posted settlement, access the closed transaction form 
by clicking the button INVOICE/Settle/Undo settlement in the action pane of the 
vendor form and reverse the settlement there. 
9.2.5.4 Customers 
A description of the core elements in the customer record (Accounts receivable> 
Customers> All Customers) is available in section 4.2.1 of this book. The way to 
execute transaction inquiries and to settle transactions (on the action pane tab 
COLLECT) for customers is similar to the procedures in vendor management. 
9.2.6 
Sales Tax / VAT Settings 
The sales tax/VAT functionality in Dynamics AX supports various tax regulations – 
e.g. the sales tax in the United States or the value added tax in Europe. 
Sales tax codes, which determine the tax rate, are the basis for sales tax calculation. 
In an invoice line, the applicable sales tax code is depending on both, the item sales 
tax group of the item and the sales tax group of the customer or vendor. 
9.2.6.1 Parameters on Sales Tax 
A primary setting for tax calculation is whether sales tax applies: If it does, set the 
slider Apply sales tax taxation rules on the tab Sales tax of the general ledger 
parameters to “Yes”. With this setting, sales tax jurisdictions are an additional 
grouping in the tax calculation. 
9.2.6.2 Sales Tax Authorities 
The first step in the setup of sales tax calculation is to enter the competent 
authorities (Tax> Indirect taxes> Sales tax> Sales tax authorities) with their authority 
ID, name, and report layout for tax reporting. 
9.2.6.3 Sales Tax Settlement Periods 
Applicable periods for tax reporting (usually monthly periods) are specified in the 
form Tax> Indirect taxes> Sales tax> Sales tax settlement periods. 
When creating a settlement period definition with ID and description, you have to 
assign the applicable Authority and the period length (Period interval unit and Period 
interval duration) on the tab General. Then switch to the tab Period intervals and click 
the button Add in the toolbar to enter the first period manually (e.g. Jan 1 – Jan 31). 

368 
9  Financial Management 
In order to create further periods automatically, click the button New period interval 
in the toolbar of the tab. 
9.2.6.4 Ledger Posting Groups 
Sales tax ledger posting groups control the main accounts for sales tax transactions 
(depending on the sales tax code of the invoice transaction). 
In order to create a sales tax ledger posting group, open the form Sales tax> Setup> 
Sales tax> Ledger posting groups. After entering the group ID and description, select 
the main account for Sales tax payable (tax for purchasing), or for Sales tax receivable 
(tax for sales), or for Use tax expense and Use tax payable as applicable. The Settlement 
account specifies the balance account for the amount to be paid to the authorities. 
9.2.6.5 Sales Tax Codes 
Sales tax codes control the tax rate and the calculation base. In order to create a 
sales tax code, open the form Tax> Indirect taxes> Sales tax> Sales tax codes and insert 
a record with code and name. On the tab General, assign the Settlement period and 
the Ledger posting group. Detailed calculation parameters are available on the tab 
Calculation. In order to specifying the tax rate, click the button SALES TAX CODE/ 
Sales tax code/Values in the action pane of the sales tax code form and enter the 
applicable rate in the column Value of the Sales tax code values form. 
 
Figure 9-8: 
Managing sales tax codes 
After creating a sales tax code, assign it to applicable sales tax groups and item 
sales tax groups. Dynamics AX determines the sales tax code of an invoice line 
from the sales tax code, which is included in the settings of both – the item sales tax 
group of the item and the sales tax group of the customer (or vendor). 
In order to apply a tax code “V175” in a sales invoice line for example, the line has 
to comply with both following conditions: 

9.2  Core Setup for Finance 
369 
 Item sales tax group – The item sales tax group (e.g. “STD” for a standard rate) 
of the item contains the sales tax code “V175” 
 Sales tax group – The sales tax group of the customer (e.g. “CDO” for domestic 
customers) contains the sales tax code “V175” 
9.2.6.6 Sales Tax Groups and Item Sales Tax Groups 
If you want to set up a sales tax group, open the form Tax> Indirect taxes> Sales tax> 
Sales tax groups. After entering the tax group identification and description on the 
tab Overview, switch to the tab Setup and enter all sales tax codes which apply to 
the customers or vendors belonging to the group. 
In order to assign the sales tax groups to customers and vendors, open the 
customer or vendor form and select the Item sales tax group on the tab Invoice and 
delivery in the detail form (usually when creating a customer or vendor). 
 
Figure 9-9: 
Managing item sales tax groups 
The menu item Tax> Indirect taxes> Sales tax> Item sales tax groups provides access to 
the items sales tax groups, which apply to the released products. Setting up an 
item sales tax groups works similar to setting up a sales tax group. 
In order to assign item sales tax groups to items, open the released product form 
(Product information management> Products> Released products) and select the Item 
sales tax group for sales (on the tab Sell) and for purchasing (on the tab Purchase) in 
the detail form. If you are using product categories in order lines, you can assign 
item sales tax groups to categories in the procurement categories form (Procurement 
and sourcing> Procurement categories) and in the sales categories form (Sales and 
marketing> Setup> Categories> Sales categories). 
9.2.6.7 Sales Tax Transactions 
When entering a transaction in a journal line or an order line, Dynamics AX 
initializes the sales tax code based on the combination of item and customer or 

370 
9  Financial Management 
vendor. In order to view the calculated tax before posting, click the button Sales tax 
in the action pane or toolbar of journal lines, sales and purchase order headers or 
lines, or in the posting dialog when posting a transaction (e.g. a sales invoice). 
If necessary, you can change the sales tax groups or the sales tax code in a journal 
line or order line before posting. When posting an invoice, Dynamics AX generates 
a transaction for the sales tax in the general ledger (according to the ledger posting 
group assigned to the sales tax code) and a sales tax transaction in the tax ledger. 
9.2.6.8 Sales Tax Payment 
In order to calculate and post the sales tax payable to the authorities in a period, 
execute the periodic activity Tax> Declarations> Sales tax> Settle and post sales tax. 
If you want to view the posted settlements, open the sales tax settlement periods 
form and click the button Settlements per interval on the tab Period intervals after 
selecting the appropriate period. Clicking the button Voucher in the Sales tax 
payments form then shows the related general ledger transactions. 
9.2.6.9 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The new module “Tax” includes all menu items related to sales tax. 
9.2.7 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 9.1 – Financial Dimensions 
Your organization introduces business areas for reporting purposes. In order to 
support this requirement, create a new financial dimension “##Areas” (custom 
dimension) with the shared values “Area ## 1” and “Area ## 2” (## = your user ID) 
and activate it. 
Note: Numbers are not allowed in the dimension name. 
Exercise 9.2 – Main Accounts 
Following new main accounts are required in your company (## = your user ID): 
 Main account “111C-##”, Name “Petty cash”, account type “Balance Sheet” 
 Main account “111B-##”, Name “##-Bank”, account type “Balance Sheet” 
 Main account “6060##”, Name “## - Consulting”, account type “Expense” 
 Main account “ZZ##”, Name “## account structure test”, account type “Balance 
Sheet” 
Create these accounts making sure to apply the right chart of accounts. 
Exercise 9.3 – Account structures 
Unlike the other main accounts created in Exercise 9.2, your main account “ZZ##” 
is not included in an account number range covered by existing account structures. 
For this reason, set up a new account structure only applying to this main account. 
Create and activate a new account structure “ZS##”, with the main accounts and 
the financial dimension “##Areas” (and additionally the balancing dimension, if 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
371 
interunit accounting applies) as segments. Your main account “ZZ##” is the only 
applicable main account in this account structure. Then assign the account 
structure to your test company. 
Note: If you are sharing the Dynamics AX training database, remove your account 
structure once you have finished all exercises in order to avoid confusing other 
people with too many applicable financial dimensions. 
Exercise 9.4 – Bank Accounts 
Your company opens a new bank account at your preferred bank. Create an 
appropriate bank account “B-##” with any routing number and bank account 
number. Assign the main account “111B-##” from exercise 9.2 to this bank account. 
9.3 
Business Processes in Finance 
Every business process in connection with financial values generates general 
ledger transactions in Dynamics AX. 
Most of the ledger transactions do not origin in accounting, but derive from 
transactions in other areas like purchasing, sales, or production. Transactions in 
these areas automatically generate ledger transactions in the background. 
Some ledger transactions originate from activities in accounting. In order to record 
these transactions, you have to post a journal in the general ledger module. 
9.3.1 
Basic Setup for Journal Transactions 
In addition to the basic finance setup of described in the previous section, you have 
to configure journal names before you can register a journal transaction in the 
general ledger. 
9.3.1.1 Journal Names 
Journal names (General ledger> Journals setup> Journal names) classify transactions by 
subject matters. The lookup field Journal type in this form controls in which journals 
you can use the selected journal name. The most common journal types are: 
 Daily – General journal 
 Periodic – Periodic journal 
 Vendor invoice recording – Invoice journal in accounts payable 
 Vendor disbursement – Vendor payment 
 Customer payment – Payment of customers 
If you want to use the invoice register and the invoice approval journals in 
accounts payable, you need the journal types “Invoice register” and “Approval”. 
Ledger journals show a common structure, which is independent from the journal 
type. The difference between the journal types is that different fields show in the 
different journals. In addition, some journals contain additional functionality – e.g. 
the payment proposal feature in the vendor payment journal. 

372 
9  Financial Management 
Selecting different number sequences in the Voucher series field of journal names 
makes it possible to distinguish different journals by the voucher numbers. The 
default for the offset account in journal lines is specified in the fields Account type 
and Offset account of the journal names. The example in Figure 9-10 shows the bank 
account “E001” provided as default for the offset account in journal lines which use 
the journal name “GEB”. 
 
Figure 9-10: Managing journal names 
Another important setting on journal names is the slider Amounts include sales tax. 
If this slider is set to “Yes”, amounts entered in the journal lines include sales tax 
(or input tax) if applicable. Otherwise, the entered line amount is a net amount to 
which Dynamics AX adds the sales tax. 
9.3.1.2 Journal Approval 
There are two options in the journal name setup, which define that a registered 
journal has to be approved before posting: 
 Journal approval system – Enabled in the field group Approval 
 Approval workflow – Enabled in the field group Approval workflow 
If you want to activate the journal approval system for a journal name, set the 
slider Active in the field group Approval to “Yes”. Then choose the user group, 
which is responsible for approval, in the corresponding lookup field Approve. 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
373 
If you want to apply the approval workflow, an appropriate general ledger 
workflow has to be specified in the form General ledger> Journal setup> General ledger 
workflows. The workflow type “Ledger daily journal workflow” determines 
approval workflows for daily journals. More information on workflows is available 
in section 10.4. 
9.3.1.3 Posting Layer 
The Posting layer specified in journal names and used for transactions usually is 
“Current”. If you need to cut off particular ledger transaction (for example because 
of local tax regulations), you can create separate journal names with the posting 
layer “Operations”, “Tax”, or one of the custom layers. 
Selecting the appropriate posting layer in the closing sheet (when executing the 
fiscal year closing) or by selecting an appropriate journal name (when posting a 
journal transaction) provides the option to post transactions, which are not 
included in regular reports based on the layer “Current”. In order to analyze and 
report the transactions in other layers, set up separate versions of financial reports 
which include the transactions in these layers. 
9.3.1.4 General Ledger Parameters 
The general ledger parameters form (General ledger> Ledger setup> General ledger 
parameters) contains further basic settings for journal transactions. As an example, 
you should reject duplicate vouchers in order to avoid confusion when looking at 
posted documents.  
9.3.2 
General Journal 
If you want to post a manual transaction in the general ledger, register a general 
journal. The General journal processing workspace provides the option to view, to 
create, and to edit general journals. Alternatively, you can access the general 
journals from the menu (General ledger> Journal entries> General journals). Global 
general journals (General ledger> Journal entries> Global general journals) work the 
same way as regular general journals, except that you have to select the company 
when creating a journal (regular journals use the current company). 
General journals refer to the journal type “Daily”. Depending on the particular 
transaction, you can choose a journal related to another journal type instead of a 
general journal – for example an invoice journal in the accounts payable menu, or a 
payment journal in the accounts payable or the accounts receivable menu. If you 
do not need the advanced functionality available in the specific journals (e.g. 
payment proposals in payment journals), it does not matter if you register a 
transaction in the specific journal or in the general journal. 
9.3.2.1 Journal Header 
Journals are vouchers and therefore consist of a header and at least one line. The 
header contains common settings and defaults for the corresponding lines. 

374 
9  Financial Management 
You can override the default values from the header in each line, for example 
entering a different offset account. Before you can post a journal, the balance of the 
individual vouchers (lines with the same voucher number) and the balance of the 
complete journal (shown at the bottom of the lines form) have to be zero. 
 
Figure 9-11: Selecting a journal name when inserting a general journal header 
The option selected in the lookup field Show at the top of the general journal list 
page determines whether open or posted journals display. In order to register a 
new journal, click the button New and select a journal name. In a general journal, 
only journal names with the journal type “Daily” are available. 
On the tab Setup of the journal header, you can override the default values which 
derive from the journal name (e.g. the offset account or the currency). If somebody 
works in the lines of a particular journal while you are viewing the journal header, 
it is displayed in the columns In use and In use by. 
9.3.2.2 Journal Lines 
In order to switch to the journal lines, click the Journal batch number shown as link 
in the grid of the journal list page or click the button Lines in the action pane. The 
default for the posting date when entering a new line is the current session date. 
Dynamics AX retrieves the voucher number from the number sequence of the 
journal name which you have selected in the header. Depending on the option 
selected in the column Account type of the lines, you have to enter a ledger account, 
a vendor, a customer, a bank account or a fixed asset in the column Account. 
If entering a ledger account in the Account field, segmented entry control applies 
(see below). The main account usually has to be entered in the first segment of the 
ledger account field in this case. If and which financial dimension segments are 
available and need to be entered is depending on the applicable account structure 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
375 
for the selected main account. Depending on the currently active segment in the 
ledger account field, the value lookup shows available values for that segment. 
 
Figure 9-12: Registering a voucher with multiple offset transaction lines 
After selecting the account, you can enter the applicable amount in the column 
Debit or Credit. In a single-line transaction, which shows the same amount for the 
debit and the credit account, enter the Offset account type and the Offset account 
(including segments for financial dimensions as applicable) in the appropriate 
columns of the journal line. 
The columns Company and Offset company provide the option to register 
intercompany transactions. As a prerequisite, set up intercompany accounting 
(General ledger> Posting setup> Intercompany accounting) for these companies. 
If a transaction has to be split to more than one offset account, you have to record 
the voucher in multiple lines. In this case, do not enter an offset account in the first 
line, but in one or more separate journal lines for the offset transactions. As long as 
the balance of the voucher is not zero, Dynamics AX retrieves the same voucher 
number as in the previous line. Once the voucher balance is zero, the next line 
shows a new voucher number (as prerequisite, the option “In connection with 
balance” has to be selected in the field New voucher of the journal name). 
In order to support registration, a separate pane at the bottom of the lines form 
shows the balance of the voucher related to the selected line and the balance of the 
complete journal. 
9.3.2.3 Segmented Entry Control 
Segmented entry control supports entering the ledger account in account fields 
across all areas of the application. Since the main account and all applicable 

376 
9  Financial Management 
financial dimensions are merged into one single ledger account field, entering this 
field – by selecting main account and financial dimension values one after the other 
– provides the complete posting information according to the account structure. 
 
Figure 9-13: Segmented entry for main account and financial dimensions 
When entering the ledger account, the value lookup refers to the currently active 
segment of the account field. In order to search a segment value, enter the search 
content – the first characters of the identification or the name – in the appropriate 
segment of the account field before or after opening the value lookup by clicking 
the lookup button 
 or pressing the shortcut key Alt + Down. 
The example in Figure 9-13 shows the segment lookup after entering “SA” in the 
second segment of the ledger account field. This lookup contains the department 
list filtered on departments beginning with “SA” in the ID or the name. 
The sequence and the number of segments are depending on the account structure 
applicable to the selected main account (see section 9.2.4). If the account structure 
does not apply financial dimensions or allows blanks for a particular segment, it is 
not required to enter a corresponding segment value. 
9.3.2.4 Posting Financial Journals 
Once you have finished entering the journal lines, you can post the journal by 
clicking the button Post/Post or Post in the action pane of the journal header or lines 
(in a narrow screen, click the button 
 to view all buttons). In case of incorrect 
data, Dynamics AX shows an error message and does not post the transaction. 
Clicking the button Post/Post and transfer (instead of Post/Post) in the journal header 
only posts vouchers, which contain correct data. Vouchers in the journal with 
incorrect data are transferred to a new journal where you can correct them. 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
377 
9.3.2.5 Using the Journal Approval System 
If journal approval – applying either the journal approval system or the approval 
workflow – is activated for the applicable journal name, you can’t post the journal 
before receiving the required approval. 
In case of the journal approval system, you can request the approval by clicking 
the button Approval/Report as ready in the journal header. The responsible for 
approval then clicks the button Approval/Approve to release the journal for posting. 
9.3.2.6 Periodic Journals and Voucher Templates 
If a particular transaction has to be registered and posted repeatedly, you can use 
one of the two options which support recurring registration: 
 Periodic journals – Recurring on a regular basis 
 Voucher templates – Used as copy template 
Periodic journals support registering transactions which are repeated on a regular 
basis (e.g. office rent or monthly installments). In order to create a periodic journal, 
access the form General ledger> Journal entries> Periodic journals and enter a journal 
header and journal lines (similar to registering a general journal). An alternative 
way for creating a periodic journal is to copy a general journal to a periodic journal 
by clicking the button Period journal/Save journal in the lines of a general journal. 
The column Date in the periodic journal lines specifies the start date for the 
periodic transactions. The frequency of the transaction (e.g. monthly) has to be 
specified in the columns Units and Number of units (also shown on the tab Periodic). 
 
Figure 9-14: Retrieving a periodic journal for posting 
In order to post a periodic journal, you have to create a general journal in each 
period. In the lines of this general journal, retrieve the periodic journal by clicking 
the button Period journal/Retrieve journal. Once the journal has received the periodic 

378 
9  Financial Management 
journal lines, you can edit and post the general journal lines as required. Apart 
from general journal, you can also use invoice journals in accounts payable to 
retrieve a periodic journal. 
After retrieving journal lines, the column Date in the lines of the periodic journal 
shows the next date for posting the journal. This date is calculated by adding the 
frequency period to the date shown before retrieving the periodic journal. The 
column Last date shows when the periodic journal has been retrieved the last time. 
Unlike periodic journals, voucher templates are templates for copying journals 
without managing a periodic interval. In order to create a voucher template, click 
the button Functions/Save voucher template in the toolbar of the journal lines in a 
general journal or in the action pane of invoice journal lines. In the dialog when 
saving the template, select the option “Percent” in the Template type if you want to 
apply a proportional distribution of line amounts  
If you select this voucher template in a journal at a later time by clicking the button 
Functions/Select voucher template, a dialog shows where you can enter the amount to 
be distributed to the lines according to the proportion in the template. 
9.3.2.7 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Items which are new in general journal processing include the General journal 
processing workspace and the global journals. 
9.3.3 
Invoice Journal 
Depending on the particular invoice, there are different ways for registering and 
posting an invoice. Dynamics AX provides following options for this purpose: 
 Sales order invoice – For items shipped to customers (see section 4.6.1) 
 Free text invoice – For sales invoices not related to items (see section 4.6.3) 
 Vendor invoice – For items and procurement categories received from vendors 
(with or without reference to a purchase order, see section 3.6.2) 
 General journal – For manual purchase or sales invoices (not to be printed) 
 Invoice journal –  For purchase invoices not related to items or categories  
9.3.3.1 Invoices in the General Journal 
If you want to register a vendor invoice where you have to specify an offset ledger 
account (e.g. when posting an expense), the usual choice is the vendor invoice 
journal. For customer invoices related to an offset ledger account, you can use a 
free text invoice. 
Alternatively, it is possible to register an invoice in the general journal. This is 
useful for example, if you want to record sales invoices which are not printed in 
Dynamics AX (e.g. invoices from a separate application like a POS solution). 
When entering a sales invoice in a general journal, select the Account type 
“Customer” and enter the customer number in the column Account of the journal 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
379 
lines. In the column Offset account, enter an appropriate revenue account. On the 
tab Invoice, you have to enter the invoice number and the terms of payment or the 
applicable cash discount. Before posting, you should check on the tab General if 
correct sales tax groups are used. You can additionally check the sales tax 
calculation by clicking the button Sales tax in the toolbar of the tab List. 
Registering a vendor invoice in a general journal works similar to the sales invoice 
(for a vendor invoice, choose the Account type “Vendor”). 
9.3.3.2 Accounts Payable Invoices 
Whereas there is a specific form, the free text invoice, for registering a sales invoice 
with an offset ledger account in accounts receivable, there is no such form in 
purchasing or accounts payables. 
You can register a vendor invoice – with or without reference to a purchase order – 
in the vendor invoice form (Accounts payable> Invoices> Pending vendor invoices, see 
section 3.6.2), but this form requires entering item numbers or procurement 
categories and does not contain a field for entering offset ledger accounts. 
In order to register a vendor invoice not referring to an item number or a 
procurement category, but directly to a ledger account (e.g. for office rent), you 
have to enter a journal transaction. In accounts payable, following journals are 
available for registering and approving invoices: 
 Invoice journal – Main form for vendor invoices in accounts payable 
 Invoice register – In conjunction with the Invoice approval journal 
 General journal – As described above 
If you want to apply an approval workflow to invoice journals, set up an 
appropriate workflow with a template referring to the particular journal type in 
the form Accounts payable> Setup> Accounts payable workflows and assign it to the 
particular journal name. 
The open vendor invoices page (Accounts payable> Invoices> Open vendor invoices) 
shows all invoices not yet paid, irrespective of the way of posting the invoice. The 
button New/Invoice in the action pane of this list page provides an alternative access 
to the different vendor invoice journals and the vendor invoice form. Similar 
options are available in the Vendor invoice entry workspace and in the vendor form 
(action pane tab INVOICE). 
9.3.3.3 Invoice Journal 
The invoice journal, which you can access through the menu item Accounts payable> 
Invoices> Invoice journal or through the Vendor invoice entry workspace, is the main 
form for registering invoices in accounts payable. 
Like in every voucher, you have to create a header record in the invoice journal 
before you can switch to the lines. Once you have finished registering the invoice 
lines including vendor number (Account), vendor invoice number (Invoice), 

380 
9  Financial Management 
transaction text, amount, offset account, terms of payment, approver (Approved by 
on the tab Invoice) and other data like sales tax and cash discount as applicable, 
post the invoice by clicking the button Post in the action pane of the header or lines. 
 
Figure 9-15: Registering an invoice journal line 
9.3.3.4 Invoice Register 
The invoice register, which you can access through the menu item Accounts 
payable> Invoices> Invoice register or through the Vendor invoice entry workspace, 
provides the option to pre-register vendor invoices. The invoice register already 
posts the vendor transaction, applicable sales tax transactions (depending accounts 
payable parameter settings), and ledger transactions (to interim accounts). 
Depending on prior procedures, you can assign a purchase order to the invoice in 
the invoice register. 
The structure of the invoice register with journal header and lines is similar to the 
structure of the general journals, but restricting the account type to “Vendor”. In 
the journal lines, enter the employee responsible for approval (Approved by in the 
lower pane of the journal lines), the terms of payment, the cash discount, and sales 
tax groups as applicable. If the invoice refers to a purchase order, select the 
purchase order number in the appropriate column of the journal lines to facilitate 
later approval. In order to post a journal in the invoice register, click the button 
Post in the toolbar of the header or lines. 
Posting a journal in the invoice register creates a regular vendor transaction, which 
you can access from the vendor form by clicking the button VENDOR/Transactions/ 
Transactions in the action pane after selecting the particular vendor. The slider 
Approved on the tab General of this transaction is set to “No”, which is why the 
invoice is not included in payment proposals. 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
381 
The ledger transactions of the invoice register are posted to interim accounts. These 
interim accounts are specified in the posting profile (Accounts payable> Setup> 
Vendor posting profiles, columns Arrival and Offset account on the tab Setup). 
Sales tax posting of invoice register transactions is controlled by the accounts 
payable parameters, where the lookup field Time of sales tax posting on the tab 
Ledger and sales tax determines if sales tax is already posted with the invoice 
register or later with the invoice approval. 
9.3.3.5 Invoice Approval Journal 
After posting a journal in the invoice register, the employee who is responsible for 
approval can approve it in the invoice approval journal. 
 
Figure 9-16: The invoice approval journal lines after fetching an invoice register 
Invoice approval starts with creating a new header in the invoice approval journal 
(Accounts payable> Invoices> Invoice approval). After switching to the journal lines, 
click the button Find vouchers in order to retrieve the posted invoice register. The 
Find vouchers dialog shows all available invoice registers in the upper pane. Click 
the button Select there to choose one or more invoices for approval. Closing the 
Find vouchers dialog by clicking the button OK transfers the selected invoice(s) to 
the approval journal lines. 
If you want to remove a selected invoice from the approval journal lines before 
posting, click the button Remove vouchers in the action pane of the invoice approval. 
The next steps are depending on whether the invoice refers to a purchase order: 

382 
9  Financial Management 
 Not related to a purchase order – In this case, select a ledger account – e.g. an 
expense account – in the lower pane of the invoice approval journal lines (first 
line in the lower pane of Figure 9-16). The expense amount does not include 
sales tax. If multiple expense accounts apply, enter multiple lines sharing the 
total amount. In order to post the approval finally, click the button Post. 
 Related to a purchase order – In this case, click the button Functions/Purchase 
order in order to access the posting dialog for the related purchase order invoice. 
In the posting dialog, post the invoice as described in section 3.6.2. 
9.3.3.6 Rejecting Invoice Approval 
If you do not want to approve a vendor invoice, which has been posted in the 
invoice register (because it does not comply with applicable purchase orders or 
because of other reasons), you have to post a cancellation. 
For this purpose, access the invoice approval journal lines, retrieve the applicable 
invoice register and click the button Functions/Cancel. Clicking the button Post in 
the invoice approval journal posts the cancellation. 
9.3.3.7 Invoice Pool 
All open invoice register approvals are shown in the form Accounts payable> 
Invoices> Invoice pool. You can use the invoice pool to post the approval for invoice 
registers, which refer to a purchase order (as alternative to the invoice approval 
journal). 
In order to post an approval in the invoice pool, click the button Purchase order in 
the action pane which will show the posting dialog for the related purchase order 
invoice (like the corresponding button in the approval journal lines). 
9.3.3.8 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
The Vendor invoice pool excluding posting details is not included in the new release. 
9.3.4 
Payment 
Posting an invoice creates an open transaction for the vendor liability or the 
customer debt. 
9.3.4.1 Open Transactions 
In order to view the open transactions, click the button COLLECT/Settle/Settle 
transactions in the customer form or the button INVOICE/Settle/Settle transactions in 
the vendor form. The button CUSTOMER/Transactions/Transactions in the customer 
form or VENDOR/Transactions/Transactions in the vendor form opens the 
transactions form which shows all transactions. Selecting the checkbox Show open 
only there applies a filter showing only open transactions. 
In order to print the open transactions, choose the report Accounts receivable> 
Inquiries and reports> Open transactions report for customers and the report Accounts 
payable> Inquiries and reports> Invoice> Vendor invoice transactions report for vendors. 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
383 
9.3.4.2 Customer Payment 
If you want to register a customer payment, open the customer payment journal 
(Accounts receivable> Payments> Payment journal) or the general journal. 
If you work in the customer payment journal, create a record in the journal header 
there and switch to the lines. In the journal lines, enter the payment with customer 
number, transaction text, payment amount, and offset account. If the customer has 
paid to your bank account, choose “Bank” for the offset account type. 
If you want to settle a paid invoice when entering a payment line, select the invoice 
number in the column Invoice of the journal line (automatically inserting the 
invoice amount for payment). Alternatively, you can apply one or multiple 
invoices to a payment line by clicking the button Settle transactions in the toolbar of 
the lines. In the settlement dialog, select the paid invoices by selecting the checkbox 
in the column Mark. After clicking the button OK in the dialog, the marking applies 
to the payment journal line. 
Apart from entering a payment in the payment journal lines, you can click the 
button Enter customer payment in the payment journal header in order to create and 
to settle payment lines by selecting paid invoices. Another option for creating 
payment lines, which you can use for direct debiting (withdrawing from the 
customer bank account), is the customer payment proposal in the payment journal 
lines (similar to the vendor payment proposal, see below). 
Once you have finished entering payment lines, post the customer payment 
journal by clicking the button Post in the journal header or lines. 
9.3.4.3 Vendor Payment 
In a similar way to customer payments, payments to vendors can be entered in a 
specific payment journal or in a general journal. The menu item of the payment 
journal for vendors is Accounts payable> Payments> Payment journal. 
Manually registering a vendor payment works like registering a customer payment 
(including the options for settlement). But in most cases, you need additional 
support and control for outgoing payments. In Dynamics AX, the payment 
proposal and the payment status are available for this purpose. 
If you want to prevent paying a particular invoice, open the vendor transaction 
and switch to the tab General, where you can set the slider Approved to “No” or 
enter an Invoice payment release date. The payment proposal does not include the 
invoice until you set the approval in the transaction to “Yes” again or until the 
release date has passed. 
9.3.4.4 Method of Payment 
Methods of payment (Accounts payable> Payment setup> Methods of payment) are an 
important setting for processing vendor payments. Usually there are at least two 
methods of payment: One for manual transfers and one for electronic banking. 

384 
9  Financial Management 
In payment methods related to electronic payment, you should select the Payment 
status “Sent” or “Approved” in order to prevent posting a payment before 
generating a related payment export file. Further settings for electronic payments 
(e.g. file formats) are available on the other tabs. 
The field Period specifies if you want to collect all invoices in the selected period 
option to one payment or if you want to generate a separate payment per invoice. 
In the field group Posting on the tab General of the methods of payment, you can 
enter a bank (or ledger) account from which you want to pay. This account is the 
default for the offset account when using the method in a payment. If you want to 
support bank reconciliation by posting to a bridging account (see below), set the 
slider Bridging posting to “Yes” and enter the bridging account number. 
On the tab Payment in the vendor form, you can assign a Method of payment to a 
vendor. The payment method selected in the vendor record is the default for 
purchase orders, vendor transactions, and payment journals. 
9.3.4.5 Vendor Payment Proposal 
The payment proposal supports selecting vendor invoices for payment. In order to 
run a payment proposal, click the button Payment proposal/Create payment proposal 
in the action pane of the journal lines in a vendor payment journal. 
 
Figure 9-17: Registering lines in a vendor payment journal 
In the Vendor payment proposal dialog, you can enter the proposal type (Select 
invoices by “Due date”, or “Cash discount date”, or both) and a date range for this 
date (From date and To date). If you select the option “Cash discount date” in the 
parameter Select invoices by, invoices without cash discount are not included in the 
proposal. On the tab Records to include of the dialog, you can enter a filter on 
vendor and transaction data.  
Depending on the proposal type, the proposal for the Date to pay is the invoice due 
date or the cash discount date. If the due date (or cash discount date) is in the past, 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
385 
Dynamics AX applies today as the Date to pay. If you have entered a future date in 
the field Minimum date of the dialog (e.g. tomorrow’s date if preparing the payment 
for the next day), the Minimum date is used instead of today’s date. The Payment 
date in the dialog is used if the method of payment refers to the Period “Total”. 
After closing the dialog by clicking the button OK, the payment proposal displays 
another dialog where you can check and edit the payment proposal. After 
removing invoices or changing Date to pay (by editing the Due date on the tab 
Invoices or the Cash discount date on the tab Cash discount) as applicable, you can 
click the button Create payments to transfer the proposal to the payment journal. 
The payment proposal applies a settlement for the selected invoices. Depending on 
the method of payment in the particular invoices, there is one payment line for 
multiple invoices or a separate payment line per invoice. 
Before posting the vendor payment, you can still edit the transferred proposal by 
clicking the button Payment proposal/Edit invoices for selected payment. 
9.3.4.6 Generating and Posting Payments  
In order to check the payment before generating and posting it, you can optionally 
print the payment journal by clicking the button Print/Journal in the header or lines. 
If you require an export file for electronic payment, click the button Generate 
payments in the payment journal lines once you have finished entering the payment 
lines. Make sure to generate an export file before posting the payment, if you need 
the file. When generating the payment, Dynamics AX sets the payment status of 
the journal lines to “Sent”. If required, you can change the payment status 
manually in the appropriate column or by clicking the button Payment status in the 
toolbar of the lines. 
Finally click the button Post in the payment journal to post the payment from the 
selected bank or ledger account. 
9.3.4.7 Applying Bridging Accounts 
Bridging transactions are used, if you want to keep the payment on a separate 
account for the time from posting the payment until recognizing the transaction on 
the bank account (e.g. if you send a check). 
In this case, the payment does not directly post to a bank account but to a bridging 
account as specified in the payment method. When recognizing the transaction on 
the bank account (e.g. when checking the bank statement), you have to post a 
transfer from the bridging account to the bank account. 
In order to register and post this transfer, create a new journal in the general 
journals (General ledger> Journal entries> General journals). In the action pane of the 
general journal lines, click the button Functions/Select bridged transactions in order to 
access the form for selecting and accepting the transaction. 

386 
9  Financial Management 
9.3.4.8 Centralized Payment 
The functionality of centralized payments supports a company structure with a 
central company processing payments of an affiliated group. As a prerequisite for 
using centralized payments, you have to set up intercompany accounting (General 
ledger> Posting setup> Intercompany accounting) for the respective legal entities. In 
addition, appropriate permission settings applying an organization hierarchy with 
the purpose “Centralized payment” are required. 
Payment journals and payment proposals show the company in the column 
Company accounts. When posting a payment applying centralized payments, you 
can settle invoices in other companies as applicable. 
9.3.5 
Reversing Transactions 
In Dynamics AX, there are two different types of transaction reversals: Manually 
entered reversals (for corrections) and automatic reversals (for accruals). 
9.3.5.1 Transaction Reversal 
The transaction reversal, which is available for ledger transactions, vendor 
transactions, and customer transactions (including free text invoices), provides a 
simple way for correcting wrong vouchers in finance. 
The transaction reversal is not available for transactions which refer to inventory, 
purchase orders, or sales orders. In order to reverse these transactions, register an 
appropriate document in the original menu – for example a customer return order 
in the Sales and marketing menu. 
 
Figure 9-18: Reversing a ledger transaction 
In order to reverse a financial transaction using the transaction reversal, open the 
transaction inquiry by clicking the button CUSTOMER/Transactions/Transactions in 
the customer form or the button VENDOR/Transactions/Transactions in the vendor 
form. For ledger transactions, click the button All transactions in the trial balance 
(General ledger> Inquiries and reports> Trial balance) after selecting a main account. 

9.3  Business Processes in Finance 
387 
After selecting a transaction, click the button Reverse transaction in the action pane 
which shows a dialog for entering the Reversal posting date. If you want to reverse a 
settled vendor or customer transaction (e.g. a paid invoice), you have to cancel the 
settlement (see section 9.2.5) before you can reverse the transaction. 
Transaction reversal posts a new transaction, offsetting the original transaction. If 
required, you can reverse a reversal. 
9.3.5.2 Automatic Reversal with Reversing Entries 
Unlike manual transaction reversals, which are used to correct wrong transactions, 
reversing entries are transactions generated automatically in order to reverse 
accruals in a later period. 
Reversing entries are available in the general journals (General ledger> Journal 
entries> General journal). In order to generate a reversing entry, select the checkbox 
Reversing entry and enter a Reversing date in the rightmost columns of the journal 
lines when entering the original transaction. In the general journal header, the 
checkbox Reversing entry and the Reversing date provide a default for the lines. 
When posting a general journal with automatic reversal, Dynamics AX in parallel 
posts a second transaction reversing the original transaction. 
9.3.6 
Case Study Exercises 
Exercise 9.5 – Journal Names 
You want to register the transactions of the next exercises in your own journals. 
For this purpose, create a journal name “G-##” (## = your user ID) with the type 
“Daily”, a journal name “I-##” with the type “Vendor invoice recording”, and a 
journal name “P-##” with the type “Vendor disbursement”. Choose an existing 
number sequence in all these journal names. 
Exercise 9.6 – Segmented Entry in General Journals 
You want to transfer USD 50.00 from your main account “ZZ##” in “Area ## 1” to 
your petty cash account “111C-##” (both accounts entered in Exercise 9.2). Register 
this transaction in a general journal using your journal name “G-##”. 
Which segments apply to your main account “ZZ##”? Check the value lookup for 
the main account and the financial dimension. Then post the journal. Finally check 
the balance and transactions of both accounts entered in the journal line. 
Exercise 9.7 – General Journal 
You want to withdraw USD 100.00 from the bank account “B-##” entered in 
Exercise 9.4 and put it to your petty cash account “111C-##” entered in Exercise 9.2. 
Register this transaction in a general journal using your journal name “G-##”. 
Before posting, check the balance and transactions for the bank account and the 
petty cash account. Then post the journal and check the balances and transactions 
again. 

388 
9  Financial Management 
Exercise 9.8 – Purchase Invoice 
The vendor, which you have entered in exercise 3.2, submits the invoice “VI908” 
showing a total of USD 50.00 to your company. The invoice shows expenses which 
refer to the main account “6060##” entered in Exercise 9.2. 
Record this invoice in an invoice journal with your journal name “I-##”. The terms 
of payment and the cash discount entered in exercise 3.1 apply to this invoice. 
Before posting, check the vendor transactions and balance for the vendor and the 
ledger transactions and balance for the expense account. Then post the invoice and 
check the balances and the transactions again. 
Exercise 9.9 – Vendor Payment 
You want to pay the invoice “VI908” which you have posted in the previous 
exercise. Register the payment in a vendor payment journal applying your journal 
name “P-##”. Pay from your bank account “B-##” entered in Exercise 9.4 and 
withdraw applicable cash discount. 
Before posting, check the vendor balance and the bank account balance. Then post 
the payment and check the balances, the voucher transactions, and the transaction 
origin for the payment. 
Exercise 9.10 – Transaction Reversal 
Your vendor of exercise 3.2 now submits the invoice “VI910” with a total of USD 
30.00 to your company. Register and post the invoice like you did in Exercise 9.8. 
Afterwards you notice that the invoice is incorrect, which is why you want to 
reverse it. Before reversing, check the vendor transactions and balance for the 
vendor and the ledger transactions and balance for the expense account. Then 
reverse the invoice and check the balances and transactions again. 
9.4 
Ledger Integration 
One of the main advantages of an integrated business solution like Dynamics AX 
is, that business transactions registered anywhere in the application are also 
available in all other areas. For example, posting a sales order invoice does not 
only generate the required document, it also affects other areas generating 
following transactions: 
 Inventory transactions – Reducing inventory value 
 General ledger transactions – Revenue, COGS, stock, and customer accounts 
 Customer transaction – Open invoice in accounts receivable 
 Sales tax transactions – As applicable 
Depending on the particular transaction, the invoice may for example also post 
transactions for commission, discount, or cash payment. 

9.4  Ledger Integration 
389 
9.4.1 
Basics of Ledger Integration 
Ledger integration – the integration of the general ledger in finance with the other 
areas of the application – is one of the core characteristics of an integrated business 
solution (ERP solution). In Dynamics AX, transactions in all areas relevant to 
finance (e.g. sales, purchasing, inventory, or production) automatically post 
transactions to the general ledger. 
9.4.1.1 Basic Settings 
A number of settings control, whether and which main accounts apply to the 
different transactions in business. For the areas of purchasing, sales, inventory, and 
production covered in this book, following settings are relevant: 
 Summary accounts for vendor liabilities and customer debts – In the posting 
profiles for accounts payable/receivable 
 Main accounts for inventory transactions – In the inventory posting setup 
 Main accounts for production resource consumption – In resources, cost 
categories, and production groups 
In addition, specific settings are available for particular transactions like sales tax, 
cash discount, indirect costs, or miscellaneous charges. 
9.4.1.2 Vendors and Customers 
Vendor posting profiles control the assignment of vendor transactions to summary 
accounts in the general ledger. Customer posting profiles for customer transactions 
work similar. More details on posting profiles are available in section 3.2.3.  
9.4.1.3 Subledger Accounting 
Subledger accounting in Dynamics AX decouples subledger posting (e.g. in 
accounts receivable) from general ledger posting. The subledger journal entry 
functionality for this purpose provides the option to execute the transfer to the 
general ledger either synchronous or asynchronous, and either detailed or 
summarized. Subledger accounting does not apply to all subledger transactions, 
but to some particular document types including: 
 Free text invoice – See section 4.6.3 
 Product receipt – Purchase order receipt, see section 3.5.4 
 Vendor invoice – Purchase order invoice, see section 3.6.2 
In the general ledger parameters, settings on the tab Batch transfer rules controls the 
subledger transfer per company and per document type. The Transfer mode 
specifies, when a subledger transaction is posted to the general ledger: 
 Synchronous – Immediately posting to the general ledger 
 Asynchronous – Posting as soon as sever capacity is available 
 Scheduled batch – In a separate batch job (e.g. in the nighttime), providing the 
option to view subledger transactions before transferring to the general ledger 

390 
9  Financial Management 
For documents applying the scheduled batch transfer, posted subledger 
transactions are shown in the form General ledger> Periodic tasks> Subledger journal 
entries not yet transferred before transfer. Clicking the button Transfer now (for an 
immediate transfer) or Transfer in batch (for a scheduled transfer) in this form posts 
the subledger transaction to the general ledger. 
The button View accounting in the subledger journal entries form and in applicable 
source documents (e.g. free text invoices) provides access to the complete 
accounting information including all applicable financial segments. 
9.4.2 
Ledger Integration in Inventory 
When posting inventory receipts and issues to the general ledger, Dynamics AX 
distinguished two different types of transactions (see section 7.1.1): 
 Physical transaction – Packing slip 
 Financial transaction – Invoice 
Physical and financial transactions refer to different main accounts. 
9.4.2.1 Physical Transaction 
Posting of physical transactions to the general ledger is optional, not compulsory. 
Relevant settings on this subject include following checkboxes and sliders: 
 Post physical inventory (in the item model group) 
 Post product receipt in ledger (Accounts payable parameters, tab General) or 
Post packing slip in ledger (Accounts receivable parameters, tab Updates). 
For transactions in production control, relevant settings are available on tab General 
of the production control parameters. Physical transactions in production are 
picking list and report as finished transactions. 
Independently from the parameter settings, physical transactions of items with the 
inventory model “Standard costs” are always posted to the ledger. 
9.4.2.2 Financial Transaction 
For financial transactions, the checkbox Post financial value in the item model group 
determines whether inventory transactions post to the general ledger. If this 
checkbox is cleared in an item model group, ledger integration is not active for the 
assigned items. This is the appropriate setting for service items. Posting a purchase 
invoice in this case directly posts to the expense account for consumption. 
Inventory issues do not post ledger transactions. 
9.4.2.3 Assignment of Main Accounts 
In order to check the main accounts applying in an inventory transaction, open the 
inventory posting setup (Inventory management> Setup> Posting> Posting). The 
inventory posting setup form includes account settings for following transactions: 

9.4  Ledger Integration 
391 
 Sales order tab – Packing slips and invoices in sales 
 Purchase order tab – Product receipts and invoices in purchasing 
 Inventory tab – Journal transactions in inventory 
 Production tab – Picking lists, reporting as finished, and costing in production 
 Standard cost variance tab – Standard cost variances 
Each of these tabs shows a list of available transaction types in the left pane. After 
selecting a transaction type in the left pane, the right pane shows the main 
accounts for this transaction type. 
 
Figure 9-19: The inventory posting setup, showing account settings for revenue 
The inventory posting setup is primarily depending on the combination of two 
dimensions: 
 Item dimension – Items or categories 
 Account dimension – Customers or vendors 
In addition, main account settings optionally include the sales tax group and – for 
standard cost variance transactions – the cost group as applicable dimensions. 
For the item dimension and the account dimension (customer on the tab Sales order, 
vendor on the tab Purchase order), there are three levels for main account settings: 
 Table – Individual item, customer, or vendor 
 Group – Item group, customer group, or vendor group 
 All– All items, customers, or vendors 
The Item code “Category” – an additional option for the item dimension in sales and 
purchasing – provides the option to enter settings at product category level. The 
last line of the revenue settings in Figure 9-19 shows an example for such a setting. 
When posting a transaction, Dynamics AX always searches for the specific setting 
(“Table”) first, then for the group setting, and finally for the general setting (“All”). 

392 
9  Financial Management 
Settings for the customer and item number for example have the highest priority in 
a sales invoice transaction, followed by group settings. Settings on the tab Ledger 
and sales tax of the accounts receivable parameters control, whether the search 
should prioritize the item or the customer dimension. A similar setting for 
purchasing is available in the accounts payable parameters. 
Main account assignment is not only available in the inventory posting setup form. 
You can alternatively access these settings by clicking the button Posting in the item 
group form, or the button Setup/Item posting in the customer group or vendor 
group form. When accessing the posting setup from a group form, it shows the 
ledger settings filtered on the selected group. In the item group form, the right-
hand pane shows the main account settings filtered on the selected item group. 
9.4.2.4 Available Combinations and Ledger Reconciliation 
The transaction combinations form (Inventory management> Setup> Posting> 
Transaction combinations) determines the dimension levels, which are available in 
the inventory posting setup. 
Since reports for the reconciliation between inventory and the general ledger like 
the inventory value report (Cost management> Inquiries and reports> Inventory 
accounting - status reports> Inventory value, see section 7.3.1) usually refer to the item 
group, the item group relation is active in a common setup scenario. 
9.4.2.5 Example – Transactions Referring to Sales Order Processing 
As an example for the automatic posting of ledger transactions based on ledger 
integration settings, the lines below show the transactions in sales order processing 
with activated ledger integration for packing slip and invoice posting (physical 
and financial transactions). 
When posting the packing slip for the sales order, Dynamics AX posts a ledger 
transaction to the main accounts specified for Cost of units, delivers and Cost of goods 
sold, delivered in the inventory posting setup. When posting the invoice, 
Dynamics AX reverses the ledger transactions of packing slip posting, and posts a 
ledger transaction from the account Cost of units, invoiced to the account Cost of 
goods sold, invoiced. In parallel, a customer debt to the summary account (specified 
in the posting profile) is posted against the account Revenue and – if applicable – 
the sales tax account. 
If the inventory posting setup includes a setting in the option Discount for the line 
discount, the discount is posted to this account. Otherwise, the discount is not 
posted separately but reduces the revenue amount. 
9.4.2.6 Standard Cost Price and Moving Average 
For items assigned to an inventory model “Standard cost” (see section 7.3.1), there 
are essential settings on the tab Standard cost variance of the inventory posting 
setup. This tab contains the main accounts which are used for posting differences 

9.4  Ledger Integration 
393 
between the actual cost price of the purchase order invoice (or of production order 
costing) and the standard cost price, split by posting type (e.g. Purchase price 
variance). 
For items assigned to an inventory model with a fixed receipt price, settings for 
posting the price difference are available on the tabs Purchase order and Inventory. 
For items assigned to an inventory model “Moving average”, settings for posting 
the price difference (for quantities not on stock any more when receiving the 
invoice) and for revaluation are available on the tab Inventory. 
9.4.2.7 Service Items and Non-Stocked Items 
Items not tracked in inventory (e.g. office supplies or consumables) can be linked 
to the product type “Service” and a specific item group and item model group for 
service items. In the item model group, ledger integration for physical and 
financial transactions should be deselected.  
When posting a purchase order invoice for such an item, there is a transaction 
against the expense account for consumption (instead of a stock account 
transaction). When posting a sales order invoice, there is only a ledger transaction 
from the customer summary account to the revenue account (and no transaction 
from the account Cost of units, invoiced to Cost of goods sold, invoiced). 
If a non-stocked items is not included in a bill of materials, you can use an item 
model group with a cleared checkbox Stocked product (see section 7.2.1). This setting 
prevents inventory transactions and ensures that ledger integration for physical 
and financial transactions is deselected. 
9.4.2.8 Change of Settings 
In order to avoid issues when reconciling inventory and general ledger, you 
should not change integration settings in the item model group, in parameters and 
in the inventory posting setup for items, which are on stock or show open 
inventory transactions. This includes both, changing the setup itself, and changing 
the assignment of active items to item groups. 
9.4.3 
Ledger Integration in Production  
Unlike ledger transactions referring to purchasing, sales, or inventory, ledger 
transactions referring to production have to include the cost of resource operations 
in the inventory value of manufactured items. 
9.4.3.1 Production Control Parameters 
In order to comply with this requirement, the production control parameters 
include the lookup field Ledger posting with following options: 
 Item and resource 
 Item and category 
 Production groups 

394 
9  Financial Management 
The setting in the production control parameters, which is not available in the 
production parameters by site, is the default for production orders. It is possible to 
override this default in the particular production orders, for example if applying 
specific settings for prototype production. 
The option “Item and resource” in the Ledger posting parameter applies the main 
accounts specified in the inventory posting setup to item transactions. For resource 
operations, the main account settings in the resource (Production control> Setup> 
Resources> Resources, tab Ledger postings) apply. 
The option “Item and category” in the Ledger posting parameter also applies the 
main accounts specified in the inventory posting setup to item transactions. But for 
resource operations, settings of the applicable cost category (Production control> 
Setup> Routes> Cost categories, tab Ledger postings) apply. 
The option “Production group” in the Ledger posting parameter applies settings in 
the posting group (Production control> Setup> Production> Production groups). 
Production orders show the applicable production group on the tab General in the 
detail form (default from the tab Engineer in the released product). 
9.4.3.2 Ledger Transactions in Production 
When processing a production order, following ledger transactions are posted to 
the main accounts as specified in the Ledger posting parameter: 
 Picking list – Account Estimated cost of materials consumed against Estimated cost 
of materials consumed, WIP (WIP = “Work In Process”) 
 Resource operation – Account Estimated manufacturing cost absorbed against 
Estimated manufacturing cost consumed, WIP 
 Report as finished – Account Estimated manufactured cost against Estimated 
manufactured cost, WIP 
 Indirect costs – Settings in the costing sheet: Estimated indirect costs absorbed 
against Estimated cost of indirect cost consumed, WIP 
Costing the production order reverses all these transactions and posts the final 
finished product receipt, component issue, resource issue, and indirect cost 
transactions to the main accounts as specified in the Ledger posting parameter.

Core Setup and Essential Features 
The organization of an enterprise determines the setup of the ERP system. Before 
starting to work in Dynamics AX, there needs to be an implementation project 
which includes the setup of the enterprise organization and other core parameters. 
10.1 
Organizational Structures 
If you want to set up an independent installation of Dynamics AX, which contains 
its own database and application, you have got to access the Microsoft Dynamics 
Lifecycle Services. After creating or opening a project and accessing the Cloud-
hosted environments, you can add an environment and deploy it on Azure (or locally 
on a virtual hard disk for development and demo purposes). Usually there is at 
least one environment for development and for tests, which is separate from the 
operational environment. 
Within one Dynamics AX environment with its database, the organization model 
represents the structure of the enterprise and its business processes. The 
organization model has to be configured according the operational and statutory 
structure of the enterprise. Depending on the type and size of the organization, 
there are different organizational structures which you can classify into following 
groups: 
 Statutory organization structures for legal reporting – Hierarchies according 
to the regulations of public authorities (e.g. for tax purposes) 
 Operational organization structures for management reporting – Hierarchies 
according to the requirements of the management (e.g. divisional structures, for 
controlling purposes and for improving business processes) 
 Informal structures – Not showing organizational hierarchies 
In order to comply with the different reporting requirements, large enterprises can 
show different organizational structures and hierarchies in parallel. You can for 
example set up one hierarchy matching the structure and purpose of legal entities, 
another hierarchy supporting the divisional structure, and a third hierarchy 
complying with regional structures. 
For other enterprises, one simple hierarchy without the need for different 
organizational structures may be adequate. 
10.1.1 Organization Model Architecture 
The organization model in Microsoft Dynamics AX supports the requirements of 
different organization types. Depending on the requirements, the organization 
setup alternatively includes multiple organization hierarchies in parallel,

396 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
decoupling the operational organization from the statutory organization, or only 
one simple hierarchy used for all purposes at the same time. 
10.1.1.1 Organization Types 
Following organization types are included in the organization model: 
 Legal entities – Showing the statutory organization 
 Operating units – Showing the operational organization 
 Teams – Showing informal structures 
Only organization units of the type “Legal entity” and “Operating unit” are 
applicable elements for setting up organization hierarchies in Dynamics AX. 
Since organization units of the type “Team” are an informal type of organizations, 
they are not included in hierarchies. Teams are used in various areas of the 
application, for example as a basis for restricting access to the global address book. 
10.1.1.2 Using the Organization Model within Dynamics AX  
Following areas apply the organization model within Dynamics AX: 
 Company structure – Legal entities are linked to companies in Dynamics AX, 
which is why you have to set up legal entities for creating companies. 
 Financial dimensions – Since legal entities and operating units are available as 
basis for financial dimensions, they can be used for financial reporting. 
 Data security – Based on the organization hierarchy purpose Security, access of 
users to organizations may be configured independently from the structure of 
legal entities. 
 Business policies – Business rules for areas like approval processes and 
centralized payments can apply a structure which is different from the 
hierarchy of legal entities. 
Legal entities and operating units are not only part of the organization hierarchies, 
but they are also included in the global address book (see section 2.4). For this 
reason, features of the global address book like address and contact administration 
are available for legal entities and operating units. 
10.1.1.3 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Virtual company accounts (supporting shared data across companies in former 
releases) are not supported in the new version, but starting with the May 2016 
update you can use cross-company data replication. 
Data partitions, which have provided the option to separate data of organizations 
working in a common Dynamics AX 2012 R2/R3 database, are not officially 
supported in the new version. In the initial release of Dynamics ‘AX 7’, data 
partitions are still included as key field in each relevant table and you can use the 
parameter “&prt” to select a partition when accessing Dynamics AX (e.g. 
https://XXX.com/?&prt=ps for the data partition “ps”), but it is not possible to 

10.1  Organizational Structures 
397 
manage partitions within the Dynamics AX client. It is recommended to set up 
separate databases instead of partitions. 
10.1.2 Organization Unit 
The organization model includes organization units of the type “Legal entity”, 
“Operating unit” and “Team”. Legal entities and operating units are the basic 
elements in the organizational hierarchies of an enterprise. 
The list page Organization administration> Organizations> Internal organizations 
shows an overview of all organizations with their type. Forms tailored to the 
specific requirements of the different organization types are available in the other 
menu items of the folder Organization administration> Organizations. 
 
Figure 10-1: Organization units in the organization model 
10.1.2.1 Legal Entities 
Legal entities (Organization administration> Organizations> Legal entities) are 
company accounts in Dynamics AX (see section 10.1.4 below), constituting the 
basic level for legal reporting. Tax reports and financial statements like balance 
sheets and income statements are based on legal entities. 
If a Dynamics AX database contains multiple legal entities, you can manage the 
relations between these legal entities. Depending on the requirements, following 
features are available: 
 Financial consolidation – Managing financial consolidation of companies in an 
affiliated group 
 Intercompany – Automating business processes between the legal entities of a 
multi-company organization 
 Organization hierarchies – Applying legal entities in the organization model 
(e.g. for setting up data security or approval processes) 
10.1.2.2 Operating Units 
Operating units (Organization administration> Organizations> Operating units) are 
used for reporting and the internal control of business processes. Depending on the 
enterprise, operating units include different types like divisions or regions. 

398 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
 
Figure 10-2: Creating a cost center in the operating unit form 
In a standard Dynamics AX environment, you can find following operating unit 
types: 
 Department – Representing functional categories, also used in human resources 
 Cost center – For budgeting and expenditure control 
 Value stream – Referring to production flows (lean manufacturing) 
 Business unit – Controlling strategic business objectives (e.g. divisions)  
 Other types for retail – Referring to retail management 
When setting up a new operating unit by clicking the button New in the action 
pane of the operating units form, select the Operating unit type first. Then enter 
additional data like name, addresses and contact data in the detail form. 
Once an operating unit is assigned to one or more hierarchies, you can click the 
button View in hierarchy to check the allocation within organizational structures. 
Linking operating units to financial dimensions (see section 9.2.3) provides the 
option to report on their performance. 
10.1.2.3 Teams 
Teams (Organization administration> Organizations> Teams) represent the informal 
organization of an enterprise. A team is a group of people, without a hierarchical 
organization structure between different teams. 
Team types, which you can access by clicking the button Team types in the action 
pane of the Teams form, restrict the team membership to different kinds of people – 
e.g. Dynamics AX users, employees, or sales contacts.  
When creating a new team, you have to select the team type. On the tab Team 
members, you can subsequently assign people to the team by clicking the button 

10.1  Organizational Structures 
399 
Add team members in the toolbar. Depending on the team type, available members 
are for example Dynamics AX users, vendors, or employees. 
Teams are used in various areas of the application, for example in collections 
(select the responsible team in the accounts receivable parameters). 
10.1.3 Organization Hierarchy Structures 
An organization hierarchy shows the relationship between the different 
organization units according to the particular purpose of the hierarchy. An 
organizational hierarchy of legal entities for example shows the legal structure. 
Depending on the requirements of your enterprise, there are multiple hierarchies 
in parallel. The purposes of a hierarchy determine its functional areas. Hierarchies 
of the type Security for example apply to data security. 
10.1.3.1 Organization Hierarchies 
In order to view the organization hierarchies in your enterprise, open the form 
Organization administration> Organizations> Organization hierarchies. If you want to 
create a new hierarchy, click the button New and enter the hierarchy name. Then 
click the button Assign purpose on the tab Purposes to assign one or more hierarchy 
purposes to the hierarchy. 
 
Figure 10-3: Editing an organization hierarchy in the hierarchy designer 
Clicking the button View in the action pane provides access to the hierarchy 
designer for viewing the hierarchy. In the hierarchy designer, you can navigate 

400 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
within the hierarchy, or switch the focus by clicking the button 
 on the bottom 
right of the organization unit tiles. 
After switching to the edit mode by clicking the button Edit in the action pane of 
the hierarchy designer, you can insert or remove organization units from the 
hierarchy as applicable by clicking the appropriate button in the toolbar. The 
buttons Cut and Paste provide the option to move a unit including subunits within 
the whole organization hierarchy. 
The organization structure applies validity periods, which is why you have to 
enter an effective date when publishing the hierarchy after editing. 
10.1.3.2 Organization Hierarchy Purposes 
In case your enterprise requires different hierarchies for different purposes, there 
are multiple hierarchies in the organization hierarchy form. 
Organization hierarchy purposes show in the form Organization administration> 
Organizations> Organization hierarchy purposes. Since hierarchy purposes refer to 
functional features in Dynamics AX, available purposes (e.g. Centralized payments 
or Security) and the allowed organization types per purpose are determined by the 
application. 
In order to assign organization hierarchies to purposes, click the button Add on the 
tab Assigned hierarchies in the right pane after selecting the appropriate hierarchy 
purpose in the left pane of the form. Depending on the requirements, you can 
assign multiple hierarchies to one purpose or one hierarchy to multiple purposes. 
10.1.4 Legal Entity (Company Account) 
When logging on to Dynamics AX, you are accessing a particular company account 
(legal entity) which is the current company for the session. The default company 
applicable when accessing Dynamics AX is specified in your user options or in the 
Dynamics AX web address (parameter “&cmp”). 
The navigation bar of the Dynamics AX client always shows the current company. 
Depending on the setup of the company, the banner in the dashboard also shows a 
company-specific image. If you want to switch from one current company to 
another, open the lookup for switching companies by clicking the company field in 
the navigation bar. 
10.1.4.1 Managing a Company 
If you want to access the company management (legal entity administration) in 
Dynamics AX, open the form Organization administration> Organizations> Legal 
entities. In order to create a new company, click the button New or press the 
shortcut Alt+N and enter the company name, the company ID (with up to 4 digits), 
and the country/region (by default determining applicable country-specific 
Dynamics AX features) in the New legal entity dialog. 

10.1  Organizational Structures 
401 
 
Figure 10-4: Creating a company in the legal entity form 
Before you can start entering and posting transactions in the new company, the 
setup of the company has to be done in all applicable areas and modules (like 
general ledger, accounts payable, and accounts receivable). A checklist of basic 
settings is available in the appendix of this book. 
Core data in the legal entity form include the company name (which prints on all 
documents and reports) and further settings like the primary address of the 
company on the tab Addresses. If the company has got additional addresses for 
purposes like invoicing or delivery, you can add them by clicking the button 
 on 
tab Addresses. An example of an additional address is a default delivery address 
which is different from the primary company address. This delivery address is the 
default for purchase orders then (if no address from a site or warehouse applies). 
The tab Contact information contains the contact data of the company. Legal entities 
in Dynamics AX are covered by the global address book, which is why company 
addresses and contact data are included there. 
Further important settings in the legal entity form include the primary bank 
account and registration numbers (like the Routing number for tax reporting) on the 
tab Bank account information. In a company located in the European Union, enter the 
VAT registration number (VAT exempt number) on the tab Foreign trade and 
logistics. 
10.1.4.2 Companies in the Data Structure 
A Dynamics AX database can include multiple company accounts. Except for 
shared application data (like parties or products), company accounts establish a 
separate set of data within the application. The key field DataAreaId in all relevant 
Dynamics AX tables determines the company of the particular record. 

402 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
The company “DAT” is a special company in the Dynamics AX database. 
Dynamics AX automatically generates this company, which holds system data, 
when installing the system. You cannot delete it and you should not use it as test 
or operational company in order to clearly distinguish company data from non-
company specific data. 
10.1.4.3 Company Banner in the Dashboard 
In the legal entities form, you can select a picture to be displayed as banner or logo 
in the Dynamics AX dashboard. The tab Images contains a Dashboard image and a 
Report company logo for this purpose, which you can upload by clicking the button 
Change in the toolbar of the appropriate area. The option Dashboard company image 
type tab Images of the legal entities form determines the layout and the usage of the 
image in the dashboard. 
10.1.4.4 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Based on the browser-based user interface, the layout and option to switch 
between companies has changed. 
10.1.5 Site 
Unlike company accounts, which are used for legal entities, sites represent 
subsidiaries within a company. Since sites are an inventory dimension (storage 
dimension), they are available in all areas of supply chain management within 
Dynamics AX. 
In order to distinguish between subsidiaries in finance and in cost accounting, you 
can link the inventory dimension “Site” to a financial dimension. Filtering on the 
financial dimension then for example provides the option to print an income 
statement per subsidiary. 
10.1.5.1 Multisite Functionality 
The multisite functionality for managing subsidiaries in Dynamics AX includes the 
following options: 
 Operations planning (master planning) – Per site or for the entire company 
 Bills of materials – Per site or for the entire company 
 Production control parameters – Per site or for the entire company 
 Item data (Released products) – Order settings per site or for the entire 
company 
 Transactions – Sites in all inventory transactions, sales orders, purchase orders 
and production orders 
 Financial reports – Optionally for sites (if linked to a financial dimension) 
10.1.5.2 Setup of Sites 
In order to view the sites of the current company, open the form Inventory 
management> Setup> Inventory breakdown> Sites. Apart from the ID, the name, and 

10.1  Organizational Structures 
403 
the address, a site includes the assigned financial dimension on the tab Financial 
dimensions. This setting is mandatory if the dimension link is activated. 
The dimension link between the inventory dimension “Site” and a financial 
dimension is specified in the form Inventory management> Setup> Posting> Dimension 
link. If applicable to your enterprise structure, you can activate and lock the link 
there. Figure 10-5 for example shows the site form in a company in which sites are 
linked to the financial dimension “Department”. 
Since sites are a mandatory storage dimension, they are automatically activated in 
all storage dimension groups. Every inventory transaction therefore includes a 
dimension value for the site. In addition, each warehouse has to be linked to a site. 
If sites do not apply to the organization of your enterprise, set up Dynamics AX in 
a way that a single site is the default in all transactions (e.g. applying appropriate 
defaults in the Default order settings of released products). More information on 
inventory dimensions is available in section 7.2.2. 
 
Figure 10-5: Sites in a company (linked to the financial dimension “Department”) 
10.1.5.3 Production Units 
Whereas material management applies Sites as a storage dimension for establishing 
a structure level below legal entities, resource management applies Production units 
for structuring resources and resource groups. Each production unit is linked to a 
site and represents a plant in operations planning. 

404 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
10.1.5.4 Linking Sites to the Organization Model 
It is not possible to directly include sites in the organization model. But you can 
link sites to a financial dimension and financial dimensions to organization units, 
which in the end provides the option to use sites in the organization model. 
In order to apply sites to Dynamics AX finance and organization administration, 
perform following implementation steps: 
 Operating units – Create operating units with a common operating unit type 
(e.g. Department or Business unit) for the individual sites 
 Financial dimension – Set up a dimension linked to this organization unit type 
 Account structure – Apply an account structure which contains this dimension 
 Dimension link – Link the storage dimension Site to this financial dimension 
Choosing the same name for the organization unit and the related site visualizes 
sites in the organization hierarchy. Through the organization model, security 
settings are available at site level then. If the dimension link between site and 
financial dimension is activated, you can perform financial reporting per site. 
10.2 
User and Security Management 
Business applications like Microsoft Dynamics AX contain confidential data. In 
order to protect sensitive information, access to the application has to be limited in 
compliance with the requirements of the specific enterprise. 
10.2.1 Access Control 
Access control in Dynamics AX is based on two elements: 
 Authentication – Identification of users 
 Authorization – User permissions 
As a prerequisite for authenticating a user in Dynamics AX, the system 
administrator has to create and to enable a Dynamics AX user which is linked to 
the Microsoft Azure Active Directive account (Microsoft Office 365 account) of the 
user. User authentication is not only required for permission control. It is also the 
basis for logging user transactions and data updates. Further settings linked to the 
Dynamics AX user include the favorites, the user options, and the usage data, 
which enable a personalized workspace in Dynamics AX. 
Dynamics AX applies a role-based security model for authorization, which means 
that security roles control the access to application elements (e.g. menu items). A 
Dynamics AX user can have one or more roles, which determine his permissions. 
Permissions for application elements are not directly assigned to a role, but to 
duties and privileges. Duties (and privileges below duties) establish a grouping 
level for permissions in the structure of the security model. 

10.2  User and Security Management 
405 
The extensible data security framework in addition provides the option to restrict 
access based on effective dates or user data, e.g. based on the sales territory. 
10.2.2 User Management 
Each person accessing Dynamics AX has to be set up as a Dynamics AX user. 
10.2.2.1 Creating User Accounts 
In order to create a Dynamics AX user, open the list page System administration> 
Users> Users and click the button New. After typing a new Dynamics AX User ID, 
enter the Azure Active Directory account of the user in the field Alias, and specify 
the Domain. In addition, the slider Enabled has to be set to “Yes” in order to enable 
the user to log on to Dynamics AX. 
As an alternative to creating users manually, you can import Dynamics AX users 
from the Azure Active Directory through the import wizard, which you can access 
by clicking the button Import users in the action pane of the Users form. 
10.2.2.2 Security Role and Permission Assignment 
In order to specify the permissions of the particular user, switch to the tab User’s 
roles in the user detail form and assign appropriate security roles. Alternatively, 
you can use form System administration> Security> Assign users to roles to link users 
to roles. In this form, you can additionally set up rules which assign new users 
automatically to security roles. 
In the Users list page, the security roles of a particular user display in the FactBox 
pane on the right. If a user is assigned to multiple roles, the permissions of all 
selected roles apply to the user. In case permission settings for an object overlap, 
the higher access level applies. 
After assigning a security role to a user in the user detail form, you can restrict this 
role at organization level. For this purpose, select the particular role on the tab 
User’s roles of the user detail form and click the button Assign organizations in the 
toolbar. In the Assign organizations form, you can grant access to the user in the 
selected role either to all organizations or restricted to specific organizations. If 
selecting specific organizations, choose either legal entities or elements of 
organization hierarchies with the purpose Security. After selecting an organization 
in the upper pane of the Assign organizations form, click the button Grant in the 
toolbar of the lower pane in order to actually assign the permission. 
10.2.2.3 User Options 
Clicking the button User options in the action pane of the Users form provides 
access to the user options of the selected user. In case the user got appropriate 
permissions, he or she can also access the personal user options by clicking the 
button 
/Options in the navigation bar. 

406 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
Accessing the user options from the user management applies, if the administrator 
wants to predefine settings like the language or the start company. 
10.2.2.4 Assigning Employees to Users  
Apart from being a user, people who are accessing Dynamics AX can be 
employees, contractors, or contact persons at external parties (e.g. customers). The 
global address book contains both, master data of workers (employees and 
contractors) and of external contact persons. 
In order to assign a Dynamics AX user to a person in the global address book 
(worker record or external contact), select the person in the field Name of the User 
detail from. The button Maintain versions provides the option to enter an effective 
date and an expiration date. 
Worker records are required throughout the whole application of Dynamics AX. 
Examples of applicable areas are purchase requisitions, sales commissions, project 
accounting, human resources, case management, and sales prospect management. 
After linking a user to a worker who is employed in the current company, the 
worker ID applies to all areas – e.g. automatically inserting it in the field Employee 
responsible when creating a new prospect (Sales and marketing> Relationships> 
Prospects> All prospects). 
10.2.2.5 Employee Management 
The user form contains general user settings for people accessing Dynamics AX. 
Independently from the user administration, the worker form is there to manage 
the enterprise staff. 
Workers include employees and contractors, no matter whether they are 
Dynamics AX users or not. Worker records are shared across companies, and the 
contact details are included in the global address book. The employment of a 
worker determines his assignment to one or more companies. 
The worker list page (Human resources> Workers> Workers) shows all employees and 
contractors currently employed in any company of the enterprise. In order to view 
only current employees (workers of the type “Employee”) in the current company, 
open the employee list page (Human resources> Workers> Employees). If you want to 
view the workers employed in the past, or workers with a future employment, 
click the button As of date in the action pane of the worker or employee page. 
General worker data are shared across companies, but some data – including the 
employment – are company-specific. If the employee got a current employment in 
more than one company, the tab Employment in the worker detail form shows 
company-specific employment data in the current company. 
In order to create a new worker, click the button New and enter the name, 
employing company (Legal entity), personnel number (if not deriving from a 

10.2  User and Security Management 
407 
number sequence), worker type (employee or contractor), and employment start 
date in the Create new worker dialog. 
 
Figure 10-6: Managing employment data in the worker detail form 
The default for the employing company is the current company. On the tab 
Employment in the worker detail form, you can edit the employment in the current 
company or add a new employment if the worker changes from this company to 
another company of the enterprise, or if he has got a parallel employment in 
another company. 
The detail data which you have to enter in the worker record are primarily 
depending on the Dynamics AX modules used in your organization. Required 
details include data for project accounting, human resources, and expense 
management as applicable. 
10.2.2.6 Online Users 
If you want to know the users who are currently logged on to Dynamics AX, open 
the form System administration> Users> Online users. The inquiry shows all client 
sessions connected to the application. If you got appropriate permissions, you can 
click the button End sessions in the toolbar of the tab Client sessions to log off a user. 

408 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
10.2.2.7 User Group 
User groups (System administration> Users> User groups) do not refer to the role-
based security concept, but they are used for some particular settings. You can for 
example open ledger periods, which are on hold, for a specific user group. In 
workflows or financial journals, you can optionally apply user groups for 
assigning workflow tasks, for approval, and for posting restrictions. 
In order to assign users to a user group, switch to the tab Users after creating or 
selecting the appropriate group 
10.2.2.8 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
As a result of the cloud-based architecture, Dynamics AX in the current release 
uses Azure Active Directory authentication. Further changes include the employee 
assignment option for users, the filtering on the current company in the worker 
forms, and the removal of user profile form (formerly used for the role center). 
10.2.3 Role-Based Security 
In compliance with the security model in Dynamics AX, permissions are not 
directly assigned to individual users, but to security roles. 
10.2.3.1 Security Model 
The role-based security model includes following elements: 
 Role – Group of duties required for a job function (e.g. “Accountant”) 
 Duty – Group of privileges necessary for a task (e.g. “Maintain fixed assets”) 
 Privilege – Permissions on the level of objects (e.g. “Post fixed assets journal”) 
 Permission – Low-level access restriction to securable objects (user interface 
elements, reports, tables and fields, service operations) 
The assignment of a user to one or more roles (depending on his job functions) 
determines his permissions. In general, roles are linked to duties, and duties in a 
second level are linked to privileges. But if required, you can also assign a privilege 
directly to a role. 
 
Figure 10-7: Components of the security model 

10.2  User and Security Management 
409 
A role is a set of access permissions required to perform a job function. Apart from 
functional roles, which refer to the functional tasks, there are additional role types 
required when setting up a user: 
 Functional roles – For example “Buying agent 
 Organizational roles – For example “Employee” 
 Application roles – For example “System user” 
The role “System administrator” has access to all areas of the application. The 
access settings of this role are not editable. 
10.2.3.2 Managing the Security Configuration 
In order to manage security roles, duties, and privileges, open the form System 
administration> Security> Security configuration. The security configuration form 
contains the tabs Roles, Duties and Privileges for managing the different security 
elements. 
 
Figure 10-8: Viewing the duties of the security role “Accountant” 
On the tab Roles, the left pane shows the roles available in your application. After 
selecting a role, you can view the related duties and privileges by clicking the 
appropriate element in the References pane in the middle of the form. If you want to 
add a duty or privilege to the selected role, click the button Add references after 
selecting the appropriate node (e.g. “Duties”) in the References pane. If you want to 

410 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
create a completely new role, click the button Create new (or the button Copy which 
shows after clicking a role). 
A duty is a group of privileges required for a particular task, e.g. for maintaining 
fixed assets. In order to view and edit the duties, switch to the tab Duties of the 
security configuration form. After selecting a duty, you can view the assigned 
privileges (and roles) by clicking the appropriate element in the References pane in 
the middle of the form. If you want to add a privilege to the selected duty, click the 
button Add references after selecting the node Privileges in the References pane. 
A privilege contains all permissions required for an individual application object. 
In order to view and edit the security privileges, switch to the tab Privileges of the 
security configuration form. After selecting a privilege, you can view the assigned 
application objects (e.g. Action menu items) by clicking the appropriate element in 
the References pane in the middle of the form. If you want to add a permission to 
the selected privilege, click the button Add references after selecting the appropriate 
node in the References pane. 
Permissions set access restrictions at the lowest level, based on application objects. 
The permissions, which you can select in the security privileges, are determined by 
application development. 
If you edit the security configuration, updated elements show on the tab 
Unpublished objects. Clicking the button Publish all or Publish selection in the toolbar 
of this tab activates the changes. 
10.2.3.3 Security Diagnostics 
In all Dynamics AX forms, the button OPTIONS/Page options/Security diagnostics 
displays a dialog showing which roles, duties, and privileges grant access to the 
particular form. Buttons in the dialog provide the option to directly access the form 
Assign users to roles (if selecting a role in the dialog) or to add a duty or a privilege. 
10.2.3.4 Segregation of Duties 
Segregation of duties is used to ensure that particular related tasks are not 
executed by a single user, but by different users (e.g. creating purchase orders and 
paying vendor invoices). In order to use the segregation of duties in Dynamics AX, 
you can set up applicable rules in the form System administration> Security> 
Segregation of duties> Segregation of duties rules. 
Segregation rules specify duties which may not be assigned to one user at the same 
time. They do not prevent permission settings which are in conflict with a rule. But 
you can validate a segregation rule when setting it up, and you can execute a 
periodic activity to verify compliance. 
10.2.3.5 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
Changes in the current release include the structure of the security configuration 
forms and the option to view permission settings through the security diagnostics.  

10.3  General Settings 
411 
10.3 
General Settings 
A number of settings is required before an enterprise can start using Dynamics AX. 
These core settings include: 
 Organization management – See section 10.1 
 Security management – See section 10.2 
 Financial management – See section 9.2 
Each module used by your enterprise also needs to be configured according to the 
specific requirements (e.g. setting up terms of payment in purchasing and sales). In 
addition, some basic settings apply to all areas of the application. You can find a 
short description on these settings below. 
Explanations regarding the setup of a module are available in the chapter referring 
to the particular module. An overview of the basic settings for a Dynamics AX 
implementation is included in the appendix of this book. 
10.3.1 Number Sequences 
Number sequences control the allocation of numbers throughout the whole 
application. In particular, number sequences are used in following data areas: 
 Master data – For example assigning vendor numbers 
 Journals (including orders) – For example assigning purchase order numbers 
 Posted transactions – For example assigning invoice numbers 
Dynamics AX includes company-specific number sequences and number 
sequences on enterprise level. The scope parameters of a number sequence control, 
whether it is shared or specific to a company (or other organization unit). 
10.3.1.1 Creating a Number Sequence 
In order to edit the number sequences, open the list page Organization 
administration> Number sequences> Number sequences. The FactBox Number sequence 
segments in this page shows the company and other segments of the selected 
number sequence as applicable. If you want to create a new number sequence, click 
the button NUMBER SEQUENCE/New/Number sequence or press the shortcut key 
Alt+N in the number sequence form. After entering a unique Number sequence code 
and a Name, switch to the tab Scope parameters of the detail form where you can 
specify whether the number sequence is shared or restricted to a company or 
organization unit. 
On the tab Segments of the detail form, specify the number format for the number 
sequence. Segments of a number include following types: 
 Alphanumeric – Number increasing every time the number sequence is used 
by replacing the number signs (#) in the format with the next number. The 
length of the alphanumeric segment has to comply with the largest number. 

412 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
 Constant – Segments for prefixes (e.g. for a format “INV#####” or “12#####”) 
and for suffixes (e.g. for a format “#####-INV”). In general, prefixes are 
preferable since they are easier to use (e.g. for filtering). 
 Other types – Segments of the type Company, Legal entity, Operating unit or 
Fiscal calendar are available, if included in the Scope of the number sequence. 
 
Figure 10-9: The number sequences list page 
When setting up the number sequences for document and transaction numbers, it 
is a good idea to avoid overlapping of number sequences for the different 
documents in order to facilitate tracking of transactions. 
10.3.1.2 Number Sequence References 
After setting up the number sequence itself, the number sequence references 
determine the assignment of a particular number sequence to master data or 
transactions. In order to edit the number sequence references, switch to the tab 
References in the number sequence detail form, or access the tab Number sequences in 
the parameters of each module. 
A single number sequence can be assigned to multiple number sequence references 
at the same time – for example if you want to apply a common number sequence to 
invoices and credit notes. This setting does not generate duplicate number, but 
alternately assigns numbers to invoices and credit notes depending on the 
chronological order of the transactions. 
10.3.1.3 General Settings of a Number Sequence  
The numeric first (Smallest) and last (Largest) number of the number sequence are 
specified on the tab General of the number sequence detail form. The field Next 
shows the number, which the number sequence applies to the next number. You 
can change the next number, but you have to make sure to avoid duplicate keys 
and gaps in continuous numbers. 

10.3  General Settings 
413 
The slider Manual controls whether numbers have to be entered completely 
manually. The sliders To a lower number and To a higher number specify whether it is 
possible to change numbers assigned from the number sequence. 
The slider finally Continuous prevents gaps in a number sequence. Considering 
server performance, set this slider only in number sequences actually requiring 
continuous numbers to “Yes”. Continuous numbering usually applies to voucher 
numbers, since it is a statutory requirement in many countries. 
10.3.2 Calendars 
As a prerequisite for posting any transaction in Dynamics AX, an open ledger 
period which includes the posting date is required. 
10.3.2.1 Ledger Calendar 
Ledger calendars (General ledger> Calendars> Ledger calendars), which refer to the 
fiscal calendar associated with your company, determine the open periods in 
which you can post transactions (see section 9.2.1). 
10.3.2.2 Other Calendars 
Apart from the calendars in finance, additional period and calendar definitions 
apply to other areas within Dynamics AX. 
The form Organization administration> Setup> Calendars> Working time templates (or 
Production control> Setup> Calendars> Working time templates) contains default 
settings for the weekly working times. Working time templates are a basis for 
setting up calendars in the form Organization administration> Setup> Calendars> 
Calendars (see section 5.3.1). These calendars apply to supply chain management, 
including operations planning, production, purchasing, sales, and inventory 
management. 
The project accounting module uses a separate calendar, which you can access in 
the form Organization administration> Setup> Calendars> Period types. This calendar is 
a basis for project invoicing and is required for estimates, invoice subscriptions, 
and the project-related employee setup. 
10.3.3 Address Setup 
The address setup is a prerequisite for entering and printing addresses correctly. In 
order to access the address setup, which is shared across companies, open in the 
form Organization administration> Global address book> Addresses> Address setup. 
On the tab Country/region of the address setup, you can view the available 
countries. Microsoft Dynamics AX provides a standard list of countries but you 
can enter additional countries by clicking the button New. 
On the tab Parameters of the address setup, sliders specify whether ZIP/postal code, 
District or City are validated when entering an address. If set to “Yes”, you cannot 

414 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
enter an address with – for example – a new ZIP code before inserting the new ZIP 
code on the tab ZIP/postal codes in the address setup. 
The address format on the tab Address format determines how street, ZIP/postal 
code, city, and country display in the address field of addresses. In order to comply 
with the regulations in different countries, an individual format per country is 
possible. For this purpose, the field Address format in the country setup (tab 
Country/region in the address setup) controls the address format per country. 
If you want to set up a new format, click the button New in the toolbar of the 
address formats. In the Configure address component pane on the right, enter the way 
address components (including Street and City) should show on printed 
documents. The component selection is also used when entering an address: The 
address only shows fields which included in the address format of the particular 
country. 
When setting up address formats, take into account that Dynamics AX stores the 
formatted address in addition to the individual fields of the address. If you change 
the format after entering addresses, you can update existing addresses by clicking 
the button Update addresses in the address format setup. 
10.3.4 Parameters 
Parameters are basic settings which provide the option to select the business 
process version, which fits best to your organization, from the options available in 
Dynamics AX. 
Setting correct parameter values is a core task when implementing Dynamics AX. 
Depending on the individual parameter, you can or cannot easily change a 
parameter setting at a later date. Before changing any basic setting in an 
operational environment, make sure that you are aware of all consequences. 
Depending on the circumstances, read the online help or ask an expert to avoid 
data inconsistency or other problems. 
The system parameters in the form System administration> Setup> System parameters 
contain global parameters like the system language (default language for language 
texts in shared data, e.g. product descriptions), or the default basic currency. 
In addition, a parameters form controlling company-specific settings is available in 
each module of Dynamics AX. In order to access the parameters of a particular 
module, open the menu item Setup> Parameters – for example the accounts payable 
parameters in Accounts payable> Setup> Accounts payable parameters. 
10.4 
Workflow Management 
A workflow is a sequence of operations in a routine business process, containing 
the necessary activities for processing a document. Typical examples of workflows 
are approval processes, e.g. for purchase requisitions. 

10.4  Workflow Management 
415 
Microsoft Dynamics AX provides the required functionality for configuring and 
processing workflows, including the option of automated processes. You can use 
this functionality for example if you want to automatically approve low-value 
purchase requisitions while requiring manual approval for high-value requisitions. 
10.4.1 Configuring Workflows 
Workflows are available in many areas of Microsoft Dynamics AX, including but 
not limited to: 
 Purchase requisitions 
 Purchase orders 
 Vendor invoices 
 Free text invoices 
 Financial journals 
 Budgeting 
 Time and attendance 
In each applicable menu, the setup folder contains a menu item for the workflows 
in the particular module. When selecting this menu item, the workflow list page 
displays the workflows configured in the particular module. The list page 
Procurement and sourcing> Setup> Procurement and sourcing workflows for example 
contains the workflows in the procurement module. 
10.4.1.1 Graphical Workflow Editor 
In order to view and to edit a workflow shown in a workflow list page, click the 
workflow ID shown as link in the grid. Dynamics AX then downloads the 
Dynamics AX Workflow Editor, which is a program communicating through services 
with the cloud-hosted Dynamics AX environment. 
After signing in with your Azure Active Directory account, the graphical workflow 
editor shows the selected workflow with following panes: 
 Canvas – Space for designing the workflow (drag and drop elements and 
connections) 
 Toolbox – On the left, containing available workflow elements 
 Error pane – Displays error messages and warnings below the canvas (not 
shown in Figure 10-10, click the button Error pane in the action pane to display) 
If you want to access the properties of the workflow, do a right-hand click in the 
empty space of the canvas and select the option Properties in the context menu (or 
click the button Properties after selecting an empty space in the canvas). Important 
workflow settings include the Owner of the selected workflow. 
In the toolbox on the left pane of the workflow editor, workflow elements are 
grouped by type (e.g. Approvals and Tasks). Depending on the selected workflow, 
the toolbox contains different elements. In order to hide or show the toolbox, you 
can click the button Toolbox in the action pane. 

416 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
 
Figure 10-10: Graphical workflow editor showing the purchase requisition workflow 
If you want to add a workflow element to the workflow, click it in the toolbox and 
drag it to the canvas. In order to edit the properties of the element, select the option 
Properties in the context menu (right-hand click on the element) or click the 
appropriate button in the action pane button group Modify element. 
The options available for an element are depending on the element type. For 
elements requiring a manual activity (e.g. Tasks or Manual decision), the properties 
include a tab or button Assignment for assigning the responsible person. The search 
path for finding the responsible person is defined through the Assignment type. 
Applicable assignment types include participants (referring to user roles and user 
groups), hierarchies (referring to the position hierarchy in human resources), 
workflow users (user starting or owning a workflow), or specific user names. 
Workflow elements of the type Approval contain a lower workflow level with the 
approval steps. The assignment of responsible persons for approval is on the level 
of approval steps. In order to access the approval steps, double-click the particular 
approval element or click the button Level down in the action pane of the workflow 
editor. In order to view the upper level again, click the button Level up or click the 
link Workflow in the path shown in the header line of the canvas. 

10.4  Workflow Management 
417 
In the Escalation settings, you can set up automatic reassignment of a work item 
once the time limit for the assigned user is exceeded. On the tab End action in the 
escalation settings, an automatic action is specified in case the escalation path fails. 
Settings for Automatic actions provide the option to automatically take an action if 
the condition entered for the automatic action is met – e.g. approving a requisition 
if the invoice amount is below a particular value. 
In order to connect the workflow elements in the canvas, create an arrow between 
the different elements by clicking on the border of one element and dragging the 
arrow to the subsequent element (similar to Microsoft Visio). In a valid workflow, 
all elements between Start and End have to be linked. 
10.4.1.2 Work Item Queues 
The option “Queue” for assigning persons to workflow elements is only available 
for certain workflow element types (e.g. for Tasks). As a prerequisite for the queue-
based assignment, you set up to work item queues (Organization administration> 
Workflow> Work item queues). 
Work item queues are used to pool workflow activities and to assign an activity to 
a group of people instead of a single person. If a work item is assigned to a work 
item queue, all members of the queue may claim the work item and work on it. 
When setting up a new work item queue, select the workflow type in the lookup 
field Document to specify the workflows in which the work item queue is available. 
After setting the status of the work item queue to Active, it is available for 
assignment in the appropriate workflows. 
Apart from manually adding users to a work item queue, you can apply an 
automatic assignment based on filter criteria. In order to specify an automatic 
assignment, click the button Work item queue assignment in the work item queue 
form or access the menu item Organization administration> Workflow> Work item 
queue assignment rules. 
10.4.1.3 Workflow Versions 
When saving a workflow by clicking the button Save and close in the workflow 
editor, Dynamics AX creates a new version. A dialog asks whether to activate the 
new version or to keep the previous version activated. 
If you want to check and edit the versions of a workflow, click the button 
WORKFLOW/Manage/Versions in the workflow list page. In the workflow versions 
dialog, you can set a new version or an old version as active if applicable. 
The active version applies to workflows submitted after activation. Work items of 
workflows in progress have to be finished on the original version. 

418 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
10.4.1.4 Creating Workflows 
The button New in the workflow list page for creating a workflow opens a dialog, 
where you have to select the applicable Workflow type – e.g. “Purchase requisition 
review” – before the graphical workflow editor displays as described above. 
If there are two workflows of the same type in the workflow list page, specify a 
default by clicking the button WORKFLOW/Manage/Set as default in the action pane 
of the list page. 
10.4.1.5 Basic Settings for Workflows 
Processing of workflows is an asynchronous batch job, which is why the next 
activity in a workflow is not available immediately, but only after Dynamics AX 
has processed the specific workflow element. Depending on the batch 
configuration, this can take some time. 
In order to initially set up the workflow infrastructure, a wizard is available in the 
menu item System administration> Workflow> Workflow infrastructure configuration. 
This wizard generates three batch jobs, which show in the form System 
administration> Inquiries> Batch jobs. As a prerequisite for using workflows, these 
batch jobs have to be processed repeatedly. 
10.4.1.6 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
In order to keep the graphical user experience in the cloud-based architecture, the 
workflow editor is a separate program downloaded from the workflow list pages. 
10.4.2 Working with Workflows 
If there is an active approval workflow related to a particular Dynamics AX form, a 
workflow button displays in the action pane of this form. This button shows that 
workflow processing is necessary and provides the option to submit the workflow. 
When working with workflows, you should keep in mind that the workflow 
system processes workflow tasks in a batch process. For this reason, work items 
are not available before the batch process has processed the submitted workflow. 
10.4.2.1 Submitting a Workflow 
After creating a record which requires workflow processing, submit the workflow 
by clicking the button Workflow/Submit in the action pane (see Figure 10-11). In the 
Submit dialog which shows next, optionally enter a comment and click the button 
Submit at the bottom. Submitting a workflow starts workflow processing and 
generates work items based on the corresponding workflow elements. 
Once the workflow is submitted, the workflow button does not show the option 
Submit any more, but other options depending on workflow settings and on the 
current status of the workflow. In order to check the current status of workflow 
processing, click the button Workflow/View history in the action pane. 

10.4  Workflow Management 
419 
 
Figure 10-11: Submitting a workflow for a purchase requisition 
10.4.2.2 Approving Work Items 
Depending on the settings of the related workflow element, work items are either 
assigned to a work item queue or to individual users (including assignments 
through settings like participant or workflow user).  
The work items assigned to a user show in the left pane of the dashboard (see 
section 2.1.3) and in his work item list (Common> Work items> Work items assigned to 
me). In the work item list, the available options in the workflow button are 
depending on the workflow element properties as specified in the workflow editor 
(Allowed actions in Properties/Advanced settings). These available options include: 
 Approve – Approving the request 
 Reject – Rejecting the approval finally (which does not prevent re-submitting) 
 Request change – Rejecting, but promising approval if the request is changed 
 Delegate – Transferring the decision to another user 
The additional option “Recall” shown in Figure 10-12 (approver and submitter are 
the same person in this special case) usually is not available for approvers, but for 
the persons submitting the workflow. Recalling provides the option to stop a 
workflow before approval (e.g. for changing the request before submitting again). 
 
Figure 10-12: Approving a work item 
If you want to know more details before deciding on an approval, you can access 
the original request by clicking the button Open in the action pane or clicking the 

420 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
request ID shown as link in the column ID. In the original request form (for the 
work item shown in Figure 10-12, this would be the purchase requisition form), 
you have got the same approval options as in the work item list page. 
Depending on the setup of the particular workflow (as specified in the workflow 
editor), there are additional workflow element activities or more than one person 
has to approve the request. 
10.4.2.3 Working with Work Item Queues 
If a work item is assigned to a work item queue, it shows in the list page Common> 
Work items> Work items assigned to my queues. As a prerequisite, you have to be a 
member of the work item queue to which the work item is assigned. 
In the work item queue, you can claim a work item, on which you want to work, 
by clicking the button Workflow/Accept in the action pane. Accepting a work item 
moves the item to your work item list (among the other work items directly 
assigned to you) and prevents other queue members to work on the same item. 
In the work item list (Common> Work items> Work items assigned to me), you can 
execute applicable workflow actions (e.g. approving or rejecting) like you do for 
directly assigned work items. In addition, the workflow button contains the 
options Reassign (for reassigning the work item to other persons) and Release (for 
releasing it back to the queue). 
10.5 
Other Features 
Advanced features, which are available across the whole application, include 
document management, case management, and the task guides. 
10.5.1 Document Management 
In daily business, you are working with structured data included as records in 
your business application (e.g. customers). In parallel, important data referring to 
these records are available only in an unstructured format (e.g. files or mails). 
Document management in Microsoft Dynamics AX supports solving this issue by 
assigning any number of files to any table record. The attached files are accessible 
directly within Dynamics AX. 
If you use document management for example to attach all notes and files referring 
to a particular customer in the customer form, Dynamics AX provides access to all 
relevant data on this customer – business data within Dynamics AX as well as 
related files – directly from the customer form. 
10.5.1.1 Document Handling Form 
As a prerequisite for using the document handling form, the slider Enable document 
handling on the tab Preferences in your user options has to be set to “Yes”. 

10.5  Other Features 
421 
The document handling form, which you can access in any list page or form by 
clicking the button 
 in the action pane or pressing the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+A, 
provides access to the document handling form where you can manage notes and 
documents as applicable. These documents are attached to the record which has 
been selected in the original form when opening document handling. 
 
Figure 10-13: Entering a simple note in the document handling form 
If you want to create a new document in the document handling form, insert a new 
record by clicking the button New in the action pane or by pressing the shortcut 
key Alt+N. The Type selected in the new record determines if the document is a 
note, a file attachment, or a URL. If the type is a note, you can enter a longer text in 
the field Notes on the tab General. 
In case the document is an attachment, you can view the attached document later 
by clicking the button Open (which downloads the attachment) or by expanding 
the tab Preview in the document handling form. 
10.5.1.2 Document Types and Document Management Setup 
In document management, we have to distinguish between following document 
types: 
 Simple note – Only including plain text entered in the document handling form 
 File attachment – Available for attaching files 
 URL – Used to enter a web link in the field Description 
In order set up document types, open the form Organization administration> 
Document management> Document types. Each document type refers to a particular 
class and group (fields Class and Group), specifying if assigned documents are 
simple notes, attachments or URLs. 
Basic document management parameters (Organization administration> Document 
management> Document management parameters) include the number sequence for 

422 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
documents on the tab Number sequences and the file types which are available in 
document management on the tab File types (providing the option to exclude 
possibly malicious file types like EXE-files). 
If the slider Use active document tables on the tab General in the parameters is set to 
“Yes”, document handling is only available for tables included in the active 
document tables (Organization administration> Document management> Active 
document tables). 
10.5.1.3 New in Dynamics ‘AX 7’ 
As a result of the cloud-based architecture, there is no local archive directory and 
no document type creating a new Office document from within Dynamics AX  
10.5.2 Case Management 
Case management is used to manage any questions and issues centrally. It does not 
only support customer service, but also applies to collections, purchase 
management, product management, and other areas. 
10.5.2.1 Case Configuration 
Apart from the number sequence for cases, there are two main items to be 
configured before you can use case management: 
 Case categories – For grouping purposes 
 Case processes – Specifying the activities for processing a case 
Case categories (Organization management> Setup> Cases> Case categories) group 
cases by functional areas in a hierarchical structure. In order to set up a new case 
category, click the button New in the action pane and select the Category type. On 
the tab General, you can enter default values for the owner and for the Case process 
which will be used when creating a case with the current category. 
Case processes (Organization management> Setup> Cases> Case processes) support 
performing necessary steps when processing a case. Depending on the different 
types of cases in your enterprise, you can set up one or more case processes. When 
setting up a new case process, enter the Name and Description and make sure that 
the Type is “Case process” before saving the record. Then you can access the steps 
(stages) for case processing by clicking the button PROCESS/VIEW/Details. In the 
process details, you can create a process stage by clicking the button NEW/Create 
level. In the field Purpose, enter the name of the stage. If required, you can create a 
multi-level hierarchy of stages. 
For simple case processes, setting up stages may be sufficient. But if applicable, 
you can enter activities (e.g. Appointments) assigned to the stages by clicking the 
button New/Create appointment (or one of the other options in the New button). 
Activities referring to cases, which you can access in the menu folder Common> 
Activities, are in common with the activities in Sales and marketing (former CRM 
activities). If you want to make sure, that a particular activity is executed when 

10.5  Other Features 
423 
working on a case, set the slider Required in the activity to “Yes”. In addition, the 
slider Check for required activities on the tab Exit criteria of the related stage has to be 
set to “Yes”. 
10.5.2.2 Processing Cases 
If you want to create a new case, click the appropriate button in the action pane of 
any list page or detail form which refers to case management – e.g. in sales orders 
(Sales and marketing> Sales orders> All sales orders, button GENERAL/Customer/Cases/ 
Create case), customers, collections, vendors, or released products. 
Cases created in a sales order are assigned to the order and to the customer. When 
creating such a case, enter the Case category and a Description in the Create dialog. 
Defaults for the Owner, Service level agreement and Case process on the tab Other of 
the dialog are retrieved from the selected Case category. Clicking the button Create 
in the dialog then creates the case. 
 
Figure 10-14: Editing details in a case 
If you want to follow up on a case, open the list page Common> Cases> All cases and 
switch to the detail form. Assignments of the case (e.g. to a sales order) show on 
the tab Associations. If additional associations apply later, you can add them in the 
case form (e.g. additionally assigning a return order case to the original sales 
order). The FactBox Process tree shows the process steps as specified in the 
applicable Case process. The current status of the stages shows in the case process 

424 
10  Core Setup and Essential Features 
form, which you can access by clicking the button CASE/Process/Case process in the 
action pane of the case form. 
When starting to work on a case, click the button CASE/Maintain/Change status/In 
process in the action pane of the case form (if this status has not been already 
selected when creating the case). When proceeding with the case later, click the 
button CASE/Process/Case/Change stage and select the next stage, to which you want 
to move, in the dialog box. 
The tab Case log shows all interactions (e.g. receiving a product) referring to the 
case. Using the case log, other persons looking at a specific case can easily know 
the status of a case. 
If the case is attached to a Case process which includes activities (e.g. Appointments), 
you can access the related activities through the menu item Common> Activities> All 
activities (or by clicking the button GENERAL/Activities/Activities/View activities in 
the case form). Required activities of a case have to be completed by the 
responsible person. 
In order to close a case, click the button CASE/Maintain/Change status/Closed in the 
action pane of the case form. 
10.5.2.3 Product Change Case 
Product change cases provide the option to manage a common approval and 
activation of multiple bills of materials and production routes. 
 
Figure 10-15: Configuring a case category for a product change case 
As a prerequisite for product change cases, you must create at least one case 
category with the Category type “Product change”. In case categories with this type 
show the additional tab Validation rules in the case category form, where you can 

10.5  Other Features 
425 
enable predefined validation rules to make sure that all conditions for approving a 
BOM and route are met. 
Once the setup is finished, you can create a product change case by clicking the 
button ENGINEER/Product change/Create case in the action pane of the released 
product form (not the button GENERAL/Maintain cases/Create case which does not 
include the required case category). In the New case dialog, enter a Name and select 
a Case category for product change cases. 
In order to assign bills of materials to the case, open the BOM form and select or 
create the appropriate BOM. Then click the button BILL OF MATERIALS/Product 
change/Associate with case and select the applicable Case ID in the Associate with case 
dialog. Depending on the requirements, you can associate further BOMs and – in a 
similar way – routes. In addition, you can associate other products (e.g. 
components) to the case. 
If you want to follow up on the change case, view the list Open cases in the Released 
product maintenance workspace or the general list page Common> Cases> All cases 
and switch to the detail form. On the tab Associations in the case form, you can 
view all assigned products, BOMs and routes. 
Processing the case works the same way as processing a regular case (see above). 
But in addition to the regular case functionality, the button CASE/Product change/ 
Approve and activate changes is available once the case status in “In process”. In the 
Approve and activate changes form, you can set the action Approve, Activate, and – for 
versions – Expire individually per line or through the button Set action in the 
toolbar of the BOMS and routes and the BOM versions and route versions tab. 
Clicking the button Apply actions in the action pane of the form executes the actions 
selected in the lines. 
10.5.3 Task Recorder and Task Guide 
Task guides are step-by step instructions explaining how to perform a business 
process. The task recorder is used to create task guides. 
In order to open the task recorder, click the button 
/Task recorder in the navigation 
bar. In the Task recorder pane on the right-hand side, you can create a recording by 
clicking the button Create recording. Then enter a Recording name and click the 
button Start in the next dialog. Once the recording is started, execute the steps 
which you want to record in the Dynamics AX client. The button 
 next to each 
step in the task recorder pane provides the option to add instructions. 
Once you have finished the recording, click the button Stop in the task recorder 
banner at the top. The task recorder pane then provides the option to save the 
recording to your PC, to Lifecycle Services, or to export it as Word document.

Figure 10-16: Recording a guide in the task recorder 
If you want to play a recording as task guide, you can click the button Play

saved to your PC or to Lifecycle Services. 
 

Appendix 
Setup Checklist 
The checklists below show the most essential steps for setting up Dynamics AX. 
The section “Basic Setup” contains necessary configuration steps for the functional 
areas covered by the book. They have to be finished before you can start to use any 
module. Master data and other essential settings of particular modules are shown 
in the section afterwards. Depending on the specific requirements of an 
implementation, additional setup is required in most cases.
