Introduction 
The teaching of Arabic traditionally focuses on one of the most remarkable 
features of the Arabic language: words derived from a single root that is 
usually composed of three radicals or letters. With the most basic set of 
verbs-those known as Form I-the three radicals alone are the written 
form of the past tense of a verb and, often, its verbal noun. Because this 
Form I verb can then be modified by prefixes, insertions, and a doubled 
middle radicals to create other verbs-those of Forms II through X- the 
regularity of these patterns has led to the conventional wisdom that, once 
a root meaning is known, it is not difficult, in some cases, to infer the 
meanings or connotations of other verbs created from the same root. 
As authors we have also included some quadrilateral verbs that 
are widely used in Modern Standard Arabic. Four radical verbs are 
represented by 'Q' 'Q1' (with one extra letter added) and 'Qz' (with two 
extra letters added). 
The Concise Arabic-English Lexicon of Verbs in Context first took shape 
as a list compiled primarily to help Arabic language students at the 
American University in Cairo overcome the problems they encountered 
using traditional Arabic dictionaries. Unlike such dictionaries, which 
commonly display verb forms haphazardly, this lexicon arranges them into 
the ten verb forms that are commonly adapted by institutions that teach 
Arabic as a Foreign Language. Our teaching experience had shown us that 
those difficulties-common to learners of Arabic as a second language, 
as well as native speakers-would be lessened if they had a collection of 
verbs ordered in the conventional system, with each of the three essential 
units-past tense, present tense, and verbal nouns- fully vocalized for 
every single word written. Since our goal was to ease the learning process 
while promoting comprehension of present-day usage, the list naturally 
omitted unusual or disused verbs. 
This lexicon also avoids propagating the misleading assumption that 
the meanings of the verbs derived from one three-radical root are all logical 
extensions of the meaning of the Form I root. In modern Arabic usage this 
concept appears to be refuted almost as often as it is demonstrated, and its 
inevitable contradictions always confuse students. How could the root c' 
ix 

'.J u-<o, for example, which means 'to come' in Form I'~', lead in Form 
II'~' to the meaning 'to prepare' and in Form III 'Y..,b.' to the meaning 
'to lecture?' What was the logical relationship between any of those and 
the meaning 'to bring,' created by Form IV ';.;;,..;.1', and how could this be 
tied in with the state of 'being civilized' expressed by Form V '~'? For 
that matter, what was the link between any one of the other forms and the 
startling meaning of Form VIII '~\' 'to be about to die'? Only in the 
tenth Form '~I' did our students perceive a meaning-'to fetch' that 
showed a satisfying reflection of another form. Fetching something, they 
agreed, was a kind of bringing, close to ':;...;i' in Form IV. In the other 
cases the meanings of the derived forms were far from apparent, and only 
the most imaginative students could perceive them as a logical extension 
of the basic 'to come' meaning of the Form I root. 
At this point, with English meanings attached to our first list of 
modern verb usages, we realized that students would need sentences 
showing exactly how the verbs were used. And, with the addition of these 
examples, the modest glossary we first visualized soon evolved into the 
present lexicon, a word list distinguished not only by a fully vocalized 
presentation of past and present tenses and verbal nouns of every root, 
but also by fully vocalized sentences providing a context that encourages 
students to discern meanings by reading Arabic, with the assistance of 
brief English definitions. 
The brevity of these English definitions is one of the two features that 
have led us to call this lexicon 'concise.' By reducing the English to the 
fewest words possible, the attention of students is to be focused not on 
English but on the Arabic usage and its context. 
The second concise feature is in the number of verbs included. Although 
there are about s,ooo Arabic verbs derived from more than z,ooo roots, 
we have limited the collection to those we consider most essential to 
reading and speaking Modern Standard Arabic today-a selection that 
also serves to reinforce the vocabulary of the widely used Modern Standard 
Arabic textbooks and the like. Thus, our lexicon is a basic reference tool 
for beginner, intermediate and advanced students as they develop a sound 
working vocabulary in modern standard Arabic. Although students will 
supplement it with a wider range of resources as their language skills 
lntrodudion 
x 

improve, the regular use of the lexicon will strengthen their vocabulary 
and the early reading skills they require to progress in their study. 
English definitions 
The English definitions included in this book were selected to provide the 
translations that will most concisely cover the full meaning of the modern 
use of the Arabic verbs. In almost all cases, the English term is only one 
of several possible translations, but others will often suggest themselves 
immediately to English-speaking students. Under'~.)' in Arabic-English 
dictionaries, for example, such definitions as 'reply,' 'answer,' 'send back,' 
'return,' 'give back,' and 'repel' represent English synonyms that students 
would naturally use to describe conversations, correspondence, and even 
the volleys of a tennis match. When students need to jog their memories 
for an elegant translation, dictionaries can supply the necessary range of 
options, but while they are first learning the meaning of a new Arabic 
verb, they will find it more useful to concentrate on the briefest possible 
English definition. 
The definitions range from formal to colloquial usages. Many of the 
formal terms, derived largely from Latin, have been chosen because they 
express the Arabic meaning very precisely-reflecting an era when Arabic 
and Latin, as the leading languages of scholarship, naturally enriched 
each other in cultural and commercial exchanges in the lands around 
the Mediterranean. Less formal equivalent English expressions-usually 
several words rather than one-are ones students use in everyday speech. 
Making the substitutions appropriate for a formal or an informal context 
should present no difficulty. 
In a few cases, today's colloquial American English provides a strikingly 
apt fit with Arabic. For example, the colloquial expression to 'stake out' a 
place in order to catch someone by surprise better fits the verb 'Jjt.:.' than 
the more conventional translation 'ambush,' which includes both the waiting 
and the catching while the Arabic verb refers primarily to the waiting. 
One difficulty in providing English definitions for Arabic words, 
however, is the result of the differing climates in which these languages 
originally flourished. Our English translation for'~\' uses a phrase-'to 
be wetted' -that is both inadequate and inelegant. This verb, which could 
xi 
Introduction 

mean 'soaked,' 'sprinkled,' 'drizzled' or 'dampened,' will require students to 
choose a more precise English term for each particular context. Similarly, 
several English words will be needed to translate'~', which means 'late 
afternoon', because the English language never developed an equally wide 
range of terms to describe the daily circuit of the sun. 
Parenthetical information accompanying some verbs correspond to 
a complementary phrase, necessary to complete the traditional Arabic 
usage, as in 'to set (bones) for''~' and 'result (in failure) for' '~y', or it is an 
optional preposition. 
Prepositions 
Students always have difficulty with phrasal verbs. Initially, the easiest way 
to remember verbs that demand prepositions, as well as those that often 
use prepositions, is to learn similar English phrasal verbs. This lexicon 
tries to provide as many of these as possible. 
Context sentences 
Relying upon the student's knowledge of English is an important feature in 
the most effective use of this lexicon, but the crucial step is the student's 
use of the Arabic sentence to grasp meaning within a context. At first 
students will need to remember the short English term, but as they reread 
the Arabic, they will find that the sentences alone can provide the essential 
meaning. Just as they learn new words in English by using words in context, 
so they will be able to use the Arabic sentence, and its variations, to learn 
in Arabic the meaning of new Arabic words. The English definition is a 
temporary crutch, but the Arabic sentence can be a major step toward 
developing the ability to learn Arabic in an Arabic context, especially that 
it carries a heavy load of cultural components. 
The index 
Finally, we have included an index of English definitions. This will be 
useful to students searching for Arabic terms, but because the English 
definitions are brief, the index entry may be ambiguous. In many cases 
only a reading of the Arabic text will show whether the Arabic term is the 
one needed. This checking of context-a step not possible in most word 
Introduction

lists-is one of the major benefits that students will derive from using The 
Concise Arabic-English Lexicon ofVerbs in Context.
