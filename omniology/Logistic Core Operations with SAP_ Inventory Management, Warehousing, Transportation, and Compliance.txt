Chapter 1
Introduction
The most imperative challenge facing a number of managers in recent years has been
to regain lost market share and secure new competitive advantages. The impetus for
this trend continues to be the ubiquitous tendency toward globalization and the
ensuing intensiﬁcation of international competition. Customer orientation, lean man-
agement and re-engineering are the buzzwords that characterize these efforts.
In fact, several companies need to reorganize their value-added processes, whereby
special attention should be paid to the interfaces between the sales and procurement
markets, which are increasing in importance. Within this context, there is hardly a
corporate function that has grown in signiﬁcance in recent years as much as logistics.
Treated until just a few years ago as an operational aid and an object of isolated
rationalization efforts, logistics – especially in the age of supply chain management –
now is considered an essential element of strategic corporate leadership. More and
more, logistics is being functionally mapped in standard business software. Accord-
ingly, there is great demand for logistical expertise in connection with the know-how
surrounding the implementation of logistics in complex information systems.
Deﬁnition of supply chain management
Supply chain management (SCM) is the observation and administration of
logistical processes along the entire value creation chain, which includes
suppliers, customers and end consumers.
1.1
Purpose of This Project
We have divided our presentation of logistics operations with SAP into two
volumes. The purpose of them is to provide you with an introduction to the world
of logistics with SAP software and assist you in understanding the terminology,
concepts and technological components as well as their integration. Because the
described processes are complex and include a number of functional details, we
J. Kappauf et al., Logistic Core Operations with SAP,
DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-18202-0_1, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012

have attempted to make the examples as representative as possible in terms of the
presentation and functional explanation of the SAP system components, SAP ERP
(Enterprise Resource Planning) and SAP SCM (Supply Chain Management).
This means that the two volumes cover all components of SAP Business Suite
and core functions within the context of logistics. A few components, especially
technical ones, and functional areas (e.g. disposal, maintenance and service man-
agement) will not be covered.
We have taken care to explain business-related questions and their SAP-speciﬁc
solutions as well as technical terms, and illustrate their relationships. The books are
designed to provide an easily understandable yet well-substantiated look at the
respective process chains, and be a useful source of information for everyone – from
IT experts with only basic knowledge of the business-related issues, to employees
in logistics departments who are not yet familiar with SAP terms and applications.
1.2
Whom Do These Books Address?
Logistic Core Operations with SAP cannot answer every query, but we hope to give
you the tools with which to ask the right questions and understand the essential issues
involved. The contents of this book are thus aimed at the following target groups:
1.2.1
SAP-Beginners
The books are dedicated to everyone looking for a lucid, informed introduction to
logistics with SAP. Thus, each chapter describes in detail a speciﬁc logistics ﬁeld
and provides an overview of the functionality and applications of the respective
components in practical business use. In this regard, we address SAP beginners and
employees in departments where SAP is to be implemented, as well as students
wishing to obtain an impression of the logistic core processes and their mapping in
SAP software.
1.2.2
Ambitious Users
We also speak to ambitious users of SAP Business Suite who, in addition to relevant
logistical processes, want a look at process integration and the functions up- or
downstream, as well as their mapping in SAP Business Suite.
1.2.3
Managers and IT-Decision-Makers
Last but not least, we turn to management staff and IT decision-makers who are
considering the implementation of SAP Business Suite or its individual components
and wish to obtain an overview of logistical processes with SAP systems.

Introduction

1.3
Operational Signiﬁcance of Logistics
The operational signiﬁcance of logistics for many companies still lies in its ratio-
nalization potential. In general, a reduction of logistics costs should improve
corporate success by achieving a competitive advantage. Surveys of businesses
have demonstrated that, for the coming years, companies are still counting on a
considerable cost-reduction potential of 5–10% of total costs (see 3PL Study 2009,
The State of Logistics Outsourcing 2009, Third-Party Logistics). This statement
does not contradict the fact that the share of logistics costs of many companies was
more likely to increase in the past because, for instance, it is directly related to
which operational processes are included in the logistics process.
Thus, the scope of logistics in recent years has continually expanded, for
example to include production planning and control (PPS systems) or quality
control. In addition, signiﬁcant investments are being made in IT technology, in
areas such as supply chain management planning. In the near future, this will lead
to a decrease in administrative logistics costs (e.g. through shipment tracking,
transport organization or Internet-based ordering).
Further savings are expected in commercial and industrial ﬁrms by sub-
contracting logistics services (logistics outsourcing). In particular, operative logis-
tics tasks, such as transport, storage, commissioning and packaging, have already
been outsourced to a high degree to external logistics service providers. However,
since a lack of quality in logistics services is generally not blamed on the service
providers involved, but rather on the supplier, outsourcing logistics functions can be
problematic.
1.3.1
Supplementary Logistics Services
When the quality of competitor products continues to become more comparable and
there is hardly room to lower prices any further, competition takes place on the level
of service performance. Within these services, logistics ranks highly: Delivery
dependability, rapid returns processing and a high degree of customer service
quality are characteristics with which a company can set itself apart from its
competitors.
1.3.2
Customer-Oriented Logistics
Several logistics processes either include interfaces with customers or have effects
on the customer. That is why logistics processes must be oriented toward customer
needs and performed in a service-friendly manner. In an era when logistics
demands are becoming ever more exacting and, by the time the consumer is
1.3
Operational Signiﬁcance of Logistics
3

reached, ever more customized, companies that master these processes to the
advantage of their customers will experience a competitive edge that, at least in
the short term, cannot be bridged by the competition. Firms boasting excellent
logistics management can hardly be replaced by other suppliers. Thus, there are
cases in which logistics in commercial and industrial businesses is one of the core
competences for which outsourcing should not be considered. This is not to say that
the fulﬁllment of basic logistics functions (e.g. transport or storage) cannot be
outsourced, as there are plenty of providers on the market that are capable of taking
over the logistics tasks of a previous supplier on a short-term basis without
detriment to quality (make-or-buy decision).
1.3.3
Deﬁnition of “Logistics” for This Book
There are a growing number of ever-changing deﬁnitions and classiﬁcation options
offered in print as well as on the Internet for the term logistics. Of these, we would
like to use the functional, ﬂow-oriented deﬁnition of the American logistics society
“Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals” as the basis for this book
and its journey into the logistics options of the SAP Company:
Logistic management is that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and
controls the efﬁcient, effective forward and reverse ﬂow and storage of goods, services, and
related information – between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet
customers’ requirements.(Source: Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals)
According to this deﬁnition, logistics serves to move goods within the entire
value chain and requires coordination and integration between companies. It
focuses primarily on real goods, tangible assets and services that provide beneﬁt
to the customer, and it integrates them into the core logistics functions of transport,
transfer and storage.
Logistics therefore comprises the planning, control and execution of goods and
information ﬂow – between a company and its suppliers, within a company, and
between a company and its customers.
1.3.4
Differentiation from Materials Management
Materials management, on the other hand, includes all activities involved in
supplying a company and its production processes with all necessary materials
at optimal cost. Logistics takes into account spatial and temporal gaps involved
in supply processes, not only with regard to the materials, but also to the infor-
mation to be exchanged between business partners. That is why we consider
materials management to be not only a part of logistics, but its center, whereby
the functions of logistics are more comprehensive than those of materials
management.

Introduction

1.3.5
Functional Classiﬁcation of Logistics
A further possibility of logistics classiﬁcation is the differentiation of logistics
phenomena according to functional aspects. As a cross-sectional function, logistics
maintains interfaces with the primary functional business areas of acquisition,
production and sales.
1.3.6
Classic Logistics Core Areas
We thus traditionally differentiate between the following logistics areas in the order
in which goods ﬂow through a company, from the acquisition to the sales market:
•
Procurement logistics
•
Production logistics
•
Distribution logistics
1.3.7
Expansion of the Traditional Core Areas
Current logistics deﬁnitions augment these traditional core areas to include further
aspects. These include disposal logistics and operational maintenance, or service
management. Spare parts logistics ensures the materials-management-related sup-
ply and availability of spare parts.
1.3.8
Objective: As Comprehensive a Portrayal As Possible
With this project, we have attempted to provide as comprehensive a portrayal
of logistics processes and issues as possible, which include not only theoretical
principles but also problems of practical use, as well as their implementation in SAP
Business Suite. Therefore, we have expanded the traditional cross-sectional busi-
ness functions to include the following logistics areas, to which chapters in Volume
2 are dedicated:
•
Transport logistics
•
Warehouse logistics and inventory management
1.3.9
Related Literature in the Appendix

mapping in SAP Business Suite within the framework of conceptual possibilities,

disposal logistics and service management and maintenance (as well as compli-
ance) are not within the scope of this book. For more information on these topics,
refer to the bibliography. There you will ﬁnd information concerning all of the
books or sources we have quoted or referenced.
1.3.10
Logistics Functional Areas
Figure 1.1 shows the classic and expanded functional areas of logistics that will be
discussed in more detail in Logistic Core Operations with SAP.
1.3.11
Procurement Markets
On the side of the procurement markets, it is the task of procurement logistics to
acquire the articles as well as raw materials and supplies necessary for the opera-
tional processes of manufacturing and distribution. Procurement is carried out with
reference to a certain procurement and stock situation, especially based on materials
management planning as part of production logistics. The result of such planning
may be a purchase requisition. The purchase requisition is cleared for procurement,
converted into an order and transferred to the determined source for internal or
external procurement. The conclusion of a procurement transaction may involve
receiving and paying a supplier invoice, in addition to goods receipt into the

Introduction

warehouse. The Goods Receipt Department not only records stock but also its
valuation for the Accounting Department. Transfer of the materials to stock, their
quality inspection and inventory management are part of warehouse logistics and
inventory management.
1.3.12
Sales Markets
Distribution logistics primarily concerns sales processes that generally begin with a
customer ordering materials and indicating a desired delivery date. Using this
information, a sales order is generated. Depending on the delivery date, shipping
activities are initiated such that the materials reach the customer in a timely manner.
Warehouse logistics takes over the task of commissioning and material provision.
As soon as the materials have left the warehouse, a goods issue is booked to update
stock and inventory management values.
A carrier can be commissioned to deliver the materials. Transport logistics, in a
cross-sectional function, takes on the task of booking the transport planning and the
transport itself. At the end of the sales procedure, an invoice is produced for the
customer. As soon as the customer has paid for the materials, payment receipt is
recorded in Accounting.
1.4
Structure of This Book
Logistic Core Operations with SAP is divided into two volumes. Inventory Man-
agement, Warehousing, Transportation and Compliance represents the second
volume.
1.4.1
Transport Logistics
Due to its logistic signiﬁcance and related SAP applications, we have dedicated
the entire second chapter following this introduction to “Transport Logistics”
(Chap. 2), which illustrates the various SAP solutions regarding the topic of
transport. We not only shed light on the perspective of shipping agents from the
realms of manufacture and trade, but also that of transport service providers. In
addition to the basics of transport logistics and its business signiﬁcance and
transport from the standpoint of shippers and logistics service providers, we explain
in detail the individual systems and applications, and their integration into the
procurement and distribution logistics systems as well as the necessary master data.

1.4.2
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management
Chapter 3, “Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management”, describes warehouse
logistics as a link between the internal and external logistics systems. Thus, we
present those SAP processes in the realm of inventory management, goods movement
and warehouse management. In doing so, we make a clear, systematic distinction
between stock and warehouse management. This chapter also discusses warehouse
management using the Warehouse Management solution in SAP ERP (WM) as well
as in SAP SCM, SAP Extended Warehouse Management (SAP EWM).
Besides the application-speciﬁc description of the basic warehouse processes in
the areas of goods receipt and goods issue, we also have a look at the fundamentals
of inventory management, its evaluation and the integration of system components.
We illustrate special stock and special procurement forms, consignment and sub-
contract order processing based on their signiﬁcance to central logistics, as well
as the technical differences between WM (ERP) and EWM (SCM) processes.
1.4.3
Trade Formalities
Chapter 4 focuses on “Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk, Compliance”. This
chapter offers an overview of the functions of foreign trade and customs processing
with SAP ERP and SAP Business Objects Global Trade Services.
1.4.4
Controlling and Reporting
Logistic control and the related reporting process are the focus of Chap. 5,
“Controlling and Reporting”, which also covers integration into the SAP logistics
processes. We primarily examine SAP Event Management as a Track & Trace
system for the tracking of shipments and events, the classic SAP ERP-based
functions in the realm of distribution and logistics information systems, as well as
SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW). The classic reporting
functions are complemented by SAP BusinessObjects. SAP thus offers the neces-
sary tools to support users in the generation, formatting and distribution of conclu-
sive reports, or so-called dashboards. Dashboards enable more than simple data
evaluation, focusing on the integration and generation of intuitive visualizations
that immediately display where there is a need for action.

Introduction

1.4.5
Overview of Volume 1
The ﬁrst volume of this series procurement, production and distribution logistics,
provides a detailed look at the components and functions of SAP Business Suite and
SAP NetWeaver as they relate to logistics. It begins with an explanation of master
data and the organizational structures used in the logistics components of SAP
Business Suite. This is followed by an examination of the integration of these
components and functions in speciﬁc logistics applications. Internal and external
procurement are featured, including requirements determination, order processing,
invoicing and purchasing optimization. It also highlights production logistics, with
an emphasis on the deployment side. Sales and procurement planning using SAP
ERP(SAP Enterprise Resource Planning) and SAP APO (SAP Advanced Planning &
Optimization) are also discussed. Finally, the book illustrates how distribution
logistics can be managed with SAP, including order processing in SAP ERP and
SAP CRM (SAP Customer Relationship Management), the processing of inquiries,
quotations, orders, and deliveries, and special distribution situations, such as returns
processing, returnable packaging and consignment processing.
1.4.6
Appendix
At the end of both volumes, you will ﬁnd a glossary (Appendix A), a bibliography
(Appendix B) and a detailed index that can help you ﬁnd important terms and their
deﬁnitions quickly.

Chapter 2
Transport Logistics
Transport logistics refers to the transport of goods of all kinds using a variety of
means, such as trains, trucks, airplanes, ships or parcel services.
Transport logistics is a major component of business process networks. Its
signiﬁcance has increased in recent years due to increasing globalization. Whereas
companies in the 1980s and 1990s frequently focused on reducing internal costs by
introducing ERP systems, among other measures, now rising energy costs are
shifting that focus to logistics outside the company. In recent years, we have seen
similar cost optimization tendencies in the realm of transport.
2.1
The Fundamentals of Transport Logistics
The topic of transport can be considered from the perspective of various business
models, such as that of logistics service providers and carriers, or from the view of a
producing or trading company (called the shipper view in this context). Both business
models exhibit their own special features in the business process. The cooperation of
business partners in the network has its own character and set of rules. In addition,
goals can be different. Figure 2.1 illustrates the transportation relationships between
various business partners. The transport logistics involved in external logistics can
be organized by the shippers themselves as well as by logistics service providers.
From the perspective of transport logistics, we generally differentiate between
local and long-haul transport. Local transport involves a vehicle executing pick-up
or delivery and returning to the starting point on the same day. This category
generally includes the delivery of cargo that has been fed from a long-haul into a
local transport network (on-carriage), and pick-ups that have been transferred from
the local to the long-haul transport network (pre-carriage). The truck is the most
commonly used vehicle in local transport.
Long-haul transport is either carried out as direct long-haul transport (direct leg)
or via line haul. For direct long-haul transportation, a means of transport containing
the goods to be conveyed is sent directly from the shipper to the recipient over a

long distance. For line-haul processing, goods picked up on local transport routes
are transferred to another means of transport (airplane, ship, train or truck) in a
logistics center and transported along with goods from other shippers. Several
transfer processes are also possible along the entire transport route. Figure 2.2
illustrates the transportation lanes and the transportation network in local and long-
haul transport.
For long-haul transport, organizational processing efforts are generally much
higher than for local transport. Depending on the type of transportation (air, sea,
etc.), the type of goods (dangerous goods, foodstuffs, etc.) and geographic
circumstances of the origin, points of transit and destination, long-haul transport
can require the following additional tasks:

International air and sea transport can become very complex as a result.
2.1.1
Business Signiﬁcance
Transport logistics does not occur in an isolated fashion. It is always connected to
other business processes, whether they be in one’s own company or at a business
partner’s location. It organizes the exchange of goods between business partners.
Bad organization can harm or impede the subsequent business processes. In times
of very advanced internal process optimization, a well-functioning, optimized
transport logistics is becoming ever more important. Here, even greater savings
potential, total process optimization and service advantages can be achieved.
The optimization goal of transport logistics is to process all planned goods
transports in such a way that:
•
Existing transport means are used as optimally as possible
•
As few empty runs as possible occur
•
Available service providers can be contracted economically and in close obser-
vation of agreements
•
All goods are transported according to laws and regulations (dangerous goods
regulations, trade regulations, etc.)
•
Operating supply, human resources and service provider costs are minimized
•
Service times and stipulated service grade and levels (such as 24-h delivery) are
observed
Many of these optimization opportunities can be utilized to their fullest with the
aid of a suitable software system.
2.1.2
Transportation from the Shipper View
From the view of a shipper, there are three major process types that must be
supported in transport logistics:
2.1
The Fundamentals of Transport Logistics
13

•
Incoming shipments, in which ordered goods are picked up or material replen-
ishment is acquired for production
•
Outgoing shipments, in which produced or deliverable materials or goods are
transported from one plant or warehouse to a goods recipient
•
Third-party transactions, in which the shipper has the goods transported directly
from a supplier to the recipient, without the shipper physically receiving the
goods.
The desired direction of the transport demand, that is, where the goods to be
shipped are staged and where they are ultimately delivered, is virtually insigniﬁcant
for actual processing. However, you need to observe the stipulated tariffs and any
related Incoterms.
A forwarding agent can conduct transport logistics in three different ways:
•
Completely autonomous transport logistics
The shipper maintains his own ﬂeet and drivers, and, with them, attempts to
achieve optimal capacity utilization with the goods to be transported. Cost
minimization is a primary goal. The objective is to execute all goods shipments
using as few vehicles as possible. This type of organization can be observed
more often in smaller producing enterprises or retail companies. Transport
logistics is primarily in the form of local transports to and from factories and
distribution centers.
•
Internal transportation planning with external logistics service providers
The shipper can master the planning of the shipments in an optimal manner.
However, he does not own his own ﬂeet, and thus commissions a logistics
service provider or carrier to execute the shipments according to precise
instructions. This type of organization is often seen in companies in which a
number of independent suborganizations transmit their transport demands to one
central planning ofﬁce.
•
Complete outsourcing of transportation tasks and services
The shipper transfers the individual transport demand tasks to a logistics service
provider and has that agent decide on their processing. In a more extreme form,
the service provider is given further tasks for the external logistics chain
(warehouse management, order processing, and inventory control) and takes
on increased responsibility.
2.1.3
Transportation from the View of the Logistics Service
Provider
Logistics service provider is the collective term for carriers as well as freight
forwarding agents. In both types of companies, the core process and value creation
14
2
Transport Logistics

concern the processing of shipments. For the purposes of this book, freight
forwarding agents refers to companies that organize the transportation of goods,
while carriers execute the physical transport of goods.
Both kinds of companies work closely together. Freight forwarders who do
not own their own ﬂeets are dependent upon carriers who act as the executing
business partner. Larger logistics enterprises often comprise both types of
companies; the logistics service provider organization accepts, plans and processes
aggregated orders, and then passes them on to internal carriers and other external
carriers.
Carriers have responsibilities in the following realms:
•
Provision of mode-speciﬁc transportation capacities (on rail, air, sea, and road)
•
Optimized use of an internal ﬂeet and thus the opportunity to offer attractive
prices for transportation services and the provision of transport means (such as
containers)
The responsibilities of a logistics service provider include the following:
•
The consolidation of goods from various customers to achieve maximum
proﬁtability
•
Complete processing of goods transport for a customer, including the perfor-
mance of all legally required services (customs clearance, dangerous goods
treatment, paper printouts, import/export processing, goods movement) and the
professional subcontracting of all involved carriers
Consolidation and proﬁtability. The consolidation of goods from various
customers gives the logistics service provider the opportunity to optimize
proﬁts. For instance, he can commission a carrier to execute a container
shipment (full container) for $1,000 and subsequently resell the available
24 pallet spaces to a customer for $100 each. The service provider turns a
proﬁt from the 11th sold pallet space. Of course, he also carries risk of
incomplete capacity utilization.
2.1.4
Shipper and Service Provider Hybrids
From the viewpoint of the shipper, transportation processing is generally not a core
competence upon which he wishes to concentrate, but rather a necessary task in the
completion of the process chain. Instead of completely outsourcing all transporta-
tion services, the shipper can outsource his shipping department (with or without a
ﬂeet) in order to optimize his own competences and also provide them to other
business partners for their transportation processing needs. With such efforts,
outsourced logistics departments of larger enterprises increasingly represent direct
competition to logistics service providers.

2.2
SAP Systems and Applications
Especially in the realm of transportation, several transpiration solutions have been
developed in the history of SAP systems, each of which had a certain user group and
focus (see Fig. 2.3):
1. In 1987, the ﬁrst transportation solution in the mainframe system SAP R/2 was
introduced to the market (Realtime Vertrieb, RV, with Realtime Transport, RT),
whose functions were strongly inﬂuenced by shippers in the chemical industry.
2. In 1993, with SAP R/3, the transportation processing solution SD-TRA entered
the market, which represents a generic solution from the view of the shipper.
Release SAP R/3 4.6 saw the categorization of the solution in the Logistic
Execution System (LE-TRA).
3. In 2000, as a supplement to SAP ERP Transport, SAP introduced transportation
planning and optimization for shippers in SAP APO (APO-TP/VS, Transporta-
tion Planning/Vehicle Scheduling).
4. SAP Event Management (SCM-EM) was introduced to the market in 2001 as a
tracking and tracing solution for shippers as well as logistics service providers
and integrated into ERP Transport for purposes of tracking shipments.
5. With SAP Transportation Management (SAP TM) in 2007, SAP supplied a
comprehensive, independent transportation solution that served the needs of
logistics service providers as well as shippers.

2.2.1
Subprocesses and Components of SAP Transportation
Solutions
An overview of the transportation solution components is illustrated in Fig. 2.4. It
shows how the components and individual subprocesses are integrated to enable
transportation processing.
The main components of this transportation solution include:
•
SAP ERP: Sales and Distribution (SD) and Logistics Execution System
(LES) for sales orders and delivery
The sales order (see Volume 1, Chap. 6, “Distribution Logistics”) represents the
starting point for the outgoing transport demands of a shipper. The goods
purchased by a customer stemming from one or more points of departure
generate the transport or individual shipment requirements. These individual
requirements are deﬁned in the deliveries that are put together based on the sales
order.
•
SAP ERP: Materials Management (MM) and LES for purchase orders,
stock transport orders and incoming deliveries
The purchase order (see Volume 1,, Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”) is the
source document for the transport demand of a shipper, in which the goods to
be procured are deﬁned along with their procurement locations. A purchase
order can lead to deliveries, which then represent the individual shipment

requirements. Stock transfer orders (see Volume 1,, Chap. 4, “Procurement
Logistics”) between plants are a special type of order. In SAP ERP, they are
treated similarly to a normal order, with the single exception that, in addition to
an incoming delivery, an outgoing delivery is also generated, which represents
the outgoing side from the stock view.
•
SAP ERP: Logistics Execution System (LES) for shipment and freight cost
documents
The ERP shipment document and corresponding freight cost document are
planning, execution and billing documents for transportation processing. With
the component Logistics Execution System, you can create shipments and trans-
portation chains, consolidate deliveries either manually or in a rule-based way,
and document the process. Shipping costs can be calculated here as service
provider costs from the shipper view and can be invoiced. In the customer order,
you have the opportunity to access transport costs and pass them on to the
customer in the normal invoice of that particular order.
•
SAP APO: global Available-to-Promise (gATP)
The global Available-to-Promise (see Volume 1, Chap. 6, “Distribution Logis-
tics”) in the APO system supports sales order processing by determining the best
source for the materials ordered by a customer (sourcing). A customer’s
requested delivery dates, as well as shipping times, available and reserved
material quantities, and available material alternatives, are also taken into
consideration. SAM SCM 5.0 and later releases include this global availability
check in APO Transportation Planning, where you can consult a detailed
transportation plan to schedule shipments.
•
SAP APO: Transportation Planning/Vehicle Scheduling (TP/VS)
APO Transportation Planning is an optimization tool for transportation planning
that consists of several subcomponents. Transport demands are sent to the
optimizer along with information on the utilized transportation network and
existing vehicle resources. The optimizer calculates an optimal cost solution
for the respective transport demands: Routes with consolidated transport
demands are generated and are executed using the most economical resources.
Via the service provider selection, you can ﬁnd the best service provider(s),
which can be determined according to a variety of criteria (price, allocation,
quality, preference, etc.)You then have the opportunity to conduct a service
provider bid invitation to conﬁrm the selection.
•
SAP Transportation Management (SAP TM)
SAP TM is a complete solution for the processing of transportation processes as
a logistics service provider or shipper. It offers comprehensive functions for
quotation and order management, transportation planning, posting, route deter-
mination and subcontracting to service providers or internal organizations. In
addition, ﬂexible functions are integrated for transportation cost calculation for
the sale and purchase of transportation services, and for the calculation of
internal transportation costs. Integration with SAP ERP (FI/CO) is available as
a standard feature for billing customer and service provider freight costs.
18

Transport Logistics

•
SAP Event Management
SAP Event Management (see Chap. 5, “Controlling and Reporting”) is a univer-
sal and very ﬂexible tool that supports all types of visibility and status tracking
processes (Tracking & Tracing: Shipment Tracking). It enables you to record
performance data on your own and your partners’ processes and thus generate a
performance evaluation in connection with SAP NetWeaver BW.
SAP Event Management is integrated with ERP transportation processing as
well as SAP TM, and a variety of standard tracking scenarios are conﬁgured.
•
Special components for particular industries
Within the framework of the SAP portfolio, you can use further components for
special industrial requirements that are not depicted in Fig. 2.4. These
components include:
– SAP Oil & Gas Traders and Schedulers Workbench (TSW) to plan and
execute tanker transports while especially considering the raw material sale
of in-transit stock.
– SAP Oil & Gas Transportation and Distribution (TD) for the processing of
bulk commodity transports in the downstream realm (such as for the supply of
gas stations). Meter readings, temperature-dependent volume changes of bulk
commodities and the compatibility of previous and subsequent tank loads are
among the elements taken into account.
– SAP Rail Car Management (RCM) for the processing of rail transports with a
company’s or a railway’s freight cars. RCM, which is used by several
companies in the chemical industry, is based on SAP Event Management,
which it uses for freight car tracking. In addition, you can plan and execute
the individual activities of the cars and manage your own loading railway
stations and marshaling yards with Onsite Event Management (OSEM).
The number of resulting solutions is a direct reﬂection of the diversity of the
transportation industry.
2.2.2
Transportation Processing Scenarios and Their Integration
in Procurement and Distribution Logistics
Using the subcomponents and processes mentioned above, you can select various
approaches for transportation processing with SAP. Each of these approaches offers
a basic transport functionality that can be tailored through add-ons and integration
mechanisms and is thus especially suited to support the demands of its respective
user groups. The following rough guidelines can aid in the selection of the trans-
portation solutions, described subsequently in more detail:
2.2
SAP Systems and Applications
19

•
Traditional transportation processing for shippers (SAP ERP, Logistics
Execution System)
Production or commercial enterprises with general transport demands that do not
need complex strategies for source determination or availability check processes
involved in transportation planning.
•
Traditional transportation processing with add-ons (SAP APO Transporta-
tion Planning and Service Provider Selection)
Production and commercial enterprises that have increased demands on trans-
portation planning and optimization or service provider selection and bid invita-
tion processes, but do not require the integration of an availability check.
•
Shipper solution with global availability check and transportation optimi-
zation (SAP APO-TP/VS)
Production and commercial enterprises for whom optimal transportation processing
and minimized transport costs play a great role and for whom transportation is
strongly dependent upon source determination and the availability of goods. This is
especially true where issues such as material substitution or decisions regarding
international source determination and supply sources are of great importance.
•
Traditional shipper solution with support by SAP TM
Production or commercial enterprises that already use the traditional SAP
shipper solution for transportation processing can use this variant when
transitioning to a new SAP TM system. The sales order integration with freight
cost billing has been preserved, but transportation planning is transferred to the
much more powerful TM system. Processing of transports can either be done in
SAP ERP or directly in SAP TM.
•
Shipper solution with service provider reference (SAP TM in combination
with SAP ERP Distribution Logistics)
Production or commercial enterprises where transportation processing is a multi-
departmental or outsourced function. Such companies often have their own
transportation departments that receive transport demands from several com-
pany divisions (or, under certain circumstances, from various ERP systems).
However, the processing of these requirements should be consolidated to keep
costs down. The transport departments often serve as a transportation service
provider within the company.
•
Transportation service provider solution (SAP TM in combination with
SAP ERP Financials)
Transportation service providers who sell transportation as a service to other
companies and purchase transportation services from other companies (carriers).
Now we will take a closer look at these transportation solutions.
2.2.2.1
Traditional Transportation Processing for Shippers (SAP ERP,
Logistics Execution System)
The traditional SAP transportation solution for shippers, used by more than 2,000
SAP customers around the world, is transportation processing with the SAP ERP
20
2
Transport Logistics

component Logistics Execution System. It supports the shipments of outgoing
goods, goods to be picked up and to be transferred. Figure 2.5 provides an overview
of this transportation solution. The standard process for sold goods begins with an
order initiated by the customer (see
in Fig. 2.5). The customer order documents
the goods sold that are to be transported and have to be delivered from one or more
plants. Based on the customer order, one or more deliveries are generated (Distri-
bution/Shipping)
. Through manual or rule-based planning, you can then put
together shipments that contain one or more deliveries. You can also consolidate
deliveries from various plants. To map long-haul transports, you have the opportu-
nity to create individual shipment documents for pre-carriage, main and on-carriage
legs, each of which reﬂects different legs of the same delivery. For each shipment
document, you can create an event handler in SAP Event Management that enables
tracking of the shipment
. With reference to the data cited in the shipment
document and the indicated delivery dates, you can create a freight cost document
and calculate the freight charges to be paid to the service provider
.
The sales price calculation based on the sales order for a material and the
subsequently generated invoice can include the conditions used for the freight
charges. This allows you to pass the charges paid to the transportation service

provider on to the customer. You can then use the freight cost document to trigger
the transfer of the service provider costs to Financial Accounting, including the
accrual of reserves
.
The process described above is the same for incoming deliveries whose
transport demands result from purchase orders; in this case, charging the
customer with freight costs is not possible. For an order initiated from within
your company that is sent to a supplier, one or more deliveries are generated.
Each incoming delivery can be organized into shipments in the same way as
outgoing deliveries.
Special case when forming shipments with ERP Shipment Processing.
Please note that for transportation processing using the component Logistics
Execution System it is not possible to consolidate incoming and outgoing
deliveries into a single shipment. A shipment is thus always only in one
direction. If both incoming and outgoing deliveries must be planned, you
need to create separate shipments for them.
Stock transfer orders between plants are created as a special type of order.
From these stock transfer orders, outgoing deliveries are generated from the
issuing plant on the goods issue side, and incoming deliveries to the receiving
plant on the goods receipt side. Because the shipment is often necessarily based on
the transport demand of the issuing side, stock transfer order shipments are created
on the basis of outgoing deliveries. They can be consolidated with normal outgoing
deliveries into a single shipment, but not with incoming deliveries. In the case of
stock transfer orders, there is no customer invoicing of freight costs.
2.2.2.1
Traditional Transportation Processing with Add-Ons
(External Transportation Planning System or Bid
Tendering Function)
Transportation processing in SAP ERP offers you the options of manual or rule-
based transportation planning. Optimization with regard to the shortest route, the
best vehicle utilization or the lowest costs is not possible. To achieve such optimi-
zation, you can link to an external planning system via a standard interface for
external transportation systems (SD-TPS) (see Fig. 2.5). Outgoing and incoming
deliveries are divided according to a selection process based on preset rules or
several specialized, external transportation planning systems. For instance, it is
possible to link a planning system for road transport in Germany and a planning
system for Europe-wide rail transport and supply them with the respective delivery
documents. The shipments planned – and, depending on functionality, optimized –
in the external planning systems are then sent back to ERP Shipment Processing,
where they trigger the respective shipment documents. You can determine whether
the external planning system should maintain the planning authority over the
shipments from that point on or whether they are allowed to be edited in ERP
22

Shipment Processing. A resynchronization of changes made in the ERP system
does not take place.
2.2.2.2
Traditional Shipper Solution with Extended Tendering Function
Another add-on to the traditional shipper solution for transportation processing with
SAP ERP is the linkage of SAP TM with the use of the new service provider selection
and bid tendering functions. Shipments that have been planned in the ERP system are
tendered to a “pseudo” service provider, supplied by SAP TM, via the bid tendering
interface. Shipment and freight orders as well as routes and freight units are created
in Transportation Management based on the ERP shipments (see Fig. 2.6).
You can now use the service provider selection in SAP TM in order to determine
the best service providers. You can then use the new tendering functions in SAP TM
to conduct either sequential, simultaneous or open tendering. SAP Event Manage-
ment controls the tendering process and, if necessary, the required reactions when a
tendering deadline has been reached. In the case of a positive response to a tender,
the respective shipment and freight orders are synchronized back into the ERP
shipping documents.

Shipper Solution with the Global Available-to-Promise
(ATP) Availability Check and Transportation Optimization
(SAP APO-TP/VS)
If a shipping company has high demands with regard to transportation optimization
and close integration with source determination and global availability, a transpor-
tation solution can be employed from SAP ERP Logistics and SAP APO. This
solution can be used for purchasing- as well as sales-based processes. Figure 2.7
shows an overview of the process ﬂow for the sales and distribution process.
Based on the sales order, a global Available-to-Promise (ATP), or availability
check, is performed in the APO system. Within the context of this availability
check, freight units can be generated with the Routing Guide, which can then either
be scheduled forward or backward. The schedule determined by the availability
check is then transferred back into the sales order. The planning remains in the APO
system as a temporary plan until the sales order is saved. When it is saved, the
temporary transportation plan is saved along with it. Based on this plan, a service
provider selection and tendering process can be performed. Subsequently, outgoing
deliveries and shipment documents are generated in the ERP system. Actual
processing is performed on the basis of the ERP shipment documents.

Just as in the traditional shipper solution, you can also calculate and pay service
provider costs and pass them on to the customer.
2.2.2.4
Traditional Shipper Solution with SAP TM Support
If a company is already employing the traditional SAP ERP transportation solution
and is considering the transition to the new SAP TM, there is the possibility of
doing so incrementally by transferring functions such as shipment planning to the
SAP TM systems. Figure 2.8 shows the process.
Sales and purchase order processing and the creation of deliveries are conducted
in the component Sales and Distribution (SD). The generated incoming and out-
going deliveries are then communicated as transport demands via the service
interface to the TM system. In SAP TM, transportation planning and optimization,
route determination, delivery creation and ﬁnally the creation of delivery and
freight orders are performed. The freight orders are then sent back to the ERP
system via the service interface, where they generate shipment documents. Trans-
portation processing ultimately takes place in the Logistics Execution System,
where freight cost calculation and customer freight billing are generated.

2.2.2.5
Shipper Solution with Service Provider Reference (SAP TM
in Combination with SAP ERP Logistics)
A shipping company with an outsourced transportation planning department gener-
ally requires transportation functionality that enables cross-ERP system transporta-
tion planning or has a strong relationship with a service provider. The transport
demands can be generated in various systems, depending on the business area, such
as in several ERP systems in which distribution logistics is processed separately. If
a reduction in costs is targeted through a consolidation of transport demands from
various systems, it is not possible with the traditional shipper solution, because the
shipments created there each require references to delivery documents that are
distributed among several systems.
Here, Transportation Allocation is generally used when processing is done
through SAP TM. Sales orders, purchase orders and delivery documents are
generated in several systems and sent to SAP TM via the service interface
(see Fig. 2.9). In contrast to the previously described solution, the shipment and
freight orders created no longer need to be sent back to the ERP system. This would

only be done for purposes of customer freight calculation. However, freight cost
calculation in SAP TM and SAP ERP must be done separately.
All steps in transportation planning, allocation and processing are then executed
in SAP TM, whose ﬂexible planning and freight cost tools offer a higher perfor-
mance level than those of SAP ERP. Shipment tracking in this case is also
accomplished via integration of the SAP TM business object “Shipment” with
the respective event handler in SAP Event Management.
2.2.2.6
Transportation Service Provider Solution (SAP TM in Combination

Transportation service providers who execute logistics for other companies can
utilize a solution based on SAP TM that offers a ﬂexible basis upon which to map
their processes. Unlike transportation processing with SAP ERP, SAP TM does not
require a reference to delivery documents or material master records, but rather can
be employed for the entire transportation processing independent of master records
and sales and distribution processing. The basic procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2.10.

The transport demand is transferred directly by the customer as a transport
request and made into a shipment request. Based on this, freight units are assembled
that are consolidated, routed and scheduled in Transportation Planning. After
optimized or manual planning, tours and shipments are formed that ultimately
culminate in shipment orders, which are used to subcontract jobs to additional
service providers and freight carriers.
Based on shipment requests, which also contain cost segments for the invoicing
of services, customer freight invoice requests can also be created. They can be
printed as pro-forma invoices as well as transferred to Billing in the ERP system,
where customer invoices are generated and data is transferred to Financial
Accounting.
The shipment orders form the basis from which you can create service provider
freight invoice requests, which, once transferred to the ERP system, generate
service provider orders and data sheets. Via accounting integration, you can then
check incoming service provider invoices or, using the credit procedure, pay the
invoiced amounts.
2.3
Master Data in Transport Logistics
The master data used in transportation processing can be divided into four types,
which cover the following aspects of logistics information:
•
Business partner master data
Business partner master data deﬁnes the business partners that are directly or
indirectly involved in the transport process. Examples include shippers, ship-to
parties, sold-to parties, bill-to parties, customs agents and carriers.
•
Material master data
Material master data either deﬁnes the goods to be transported in a more or less
detailed or categorized form, or, in the case of logistics service providers, maps
shipping containers or services. Examples for data categories would be Yowai
XVR-2030 video recorders, automobile chassis parts, 20-ft standard containers
and 24-h delivery service.
•
Organizational master data
Using organizational master data, the units of a transportation or distribution
organization can be deﬁned. In the case of a shipper, they can be relatively
simple (only one transport allocation organization), but in the case of a logistics
service provider, they can get very complex (several business areas, national
organizations, sales ofﬁces, distribution channels, etc.).
•
Transportation network master data and resources
Transportation network master data includes information about pick-up, deliv-
ery and load transfer points, about the connections between these points that can
28
2
Transport Logistics

be used as transport routes, and about transport means (resources) that travel
between these points and can move goods.
One could consider freight cost data (such as installment tables) as a ﬁfth type of
master data. However, they are only treated as application data here. Table 2.1 lists
the master data and their system applications, of which there are three types:
•
Obligatory
The obligatory use of master data means that transportation processing cannot be
carried out without the respective master data.
•
Recommended
A recommended use indicates that the transportation process is signiﬁcantly
easier and more consistent with the respective master data. One example would
be the use of customer master data in connection with ERP invoicing from the
SAP TM system.
•
Optional
An optional usage means that this master data is integrated into the process in a
reasonable manner, yet must only be used as needed.
The SCM master data listed in Table 2.1 is a technical component of SAP SCM
and serves as the basis for APO Transportation Planning (TP/VS) as well as for SAP
TM. Although the data is used by both systems, SAP TM exhibits more compre-
hensive functionality. Master data integration between ERP and SCM is accom-
plished via the CIF (Core Interface; for more information, see Volume 1, Chap. 3,
“Organizational Structures and Master Data”).

2.3.1
Customers and Vendors in SAP ERP
The signiﬁcance of customers and vendors in SAP ERP was discussed in detail in
Volume 1, Chap. 3, “Organizational Structures and Master Data”; Chap. 4, “Pro-
curement Logistics”; and Chap. 6, “Distribution Logistics”. For this reason, we will
only refer to their transport-speciﬁc aspects here.
In transportation processing, customers can take on several roles. They are
predeﬁned in the ERP customer master as partner roles. You can expand these
partner roles via Customizing settings. A customer, for instance, used in a transport
process can serve as a sold-to party (who places an order that triggers a transport
demand), a ship-to party, bill-to party or payer. Customer master maintenance
enables you to maintain the necessary data for every role a customer has. A ship-
to party does not require bank transfer data, and you need not keep shipping
information for a payer. Important information that you can deﬁne in the customer
master includes:
•
Address information including international versions
•
Payment transaction and bank transfer information
•
Customer unloading points
•
Export data
•
Contact person
The address information and unloading points are signiﬁcant to actual transpor-
tation allocation, the contact person and export data are used in the realm of
logistics processing, and payment information is used for invoicing.
By deﬁning partner roles in the customer master, you can establish a relationship
between various customer master records. For instance, Sold-To Party A (the
branch ofﬁce of a car dealer in Chicago) can submit an order to be delivered to
Ship-To Party B (a repair shop in St. Louis), yet have the invoice sent to the head
ofﬁce in Detroit (Bill-To Party C), which is ultimately paid by Payer D.
In the ERP system, you can allocate customers to various sales areas. This
function is used for shipper processing in which a speciﬁc customer is served by
a certain part of the sales organization. However, this data is not transferred to the
SCM system. You can also save other shipping-speciﬁc attributes of a customer in
the sales-related data, such as delivery priority and delivering plant.
Vendors can primarily take on two functions in transportation processing. To
categorize vendors in one or both functions, you have to allocate them to an account
group:
•
Transportation service provider
You can not only allocate freight forwarders and shipping companies to trans-
portation service providers, but also customs agents, packing services, cleaning
companies or other service providers in the transportation industry.
•
Supplier of goods
From a logistics standpoint, suppliers of goods mainly serve to determine the
pick-up address for purchase orders and incoming deliveries.
30

Transport Logistics

The vendor master data functions similarly to the customer master data. Here,
too, several views are available in which you can enter transport-related data.
2.3.2
Plants, Storage Locations, Shipping Points and Loading
Points in SAP ERP
Plants, storage locations, shipping points and loading points form the logistical
structure of a company in SAP ERP (see also Volume 1, Chap. 3, “Organizational
Structures and Master Data”):
•
Plant, storage location
Organizational unit of logistics that categorizes a company in the views Produc-
tion, Procurement, Maintenance and Planning. In a plant, materials are produced
and/or goods and services are provided.
•
Shipping point, loading point
Organizational unit of logistics that executes shipping processing. Plants, shipping
points and their subunits are technically not master data, but deﬁned by SAP
Customizing as basic organizational structures. Nevertheless, they are still con-
sidered master data from a logistics standpoint, and are matched in the same way
as customers and vendors with the locations to be created in the SCM master data.
The primary characteristic of the organizational units mentioned here is their
location, which is deﬁned as an address and, in the case of a factory, is used for
incoming and outgoing deliveries as a delivery or outﬂow address. In the case of a
shipping point that is only used for outgoing deliveries, it is deﬁned as the outﬂow
location of a shipment. A further characteristic is the allocation to a plant calendar
that deﬁnes the “active” work days. In the case of a shipping point, the respective
loading and pick/pack time is also deﬁned as a general, that is, material- and
quantity-speciﬁc value.
2.3.3
Business Partners in SAP SCM
Business partners are organizations, companies and people that have a permanent or
independent work or order relationship with a shipper or logistics service provider.
The business partners deﬁned in SAP SCM are used exclusively in SAP TM. For
the default process, these business partners are automatically generated through
master data transfer of customers and vendors from SAP ERP. Manual entry into
SAP TM is thus only necessary in special cases.
In Table 2.1, you can see that SAP TM offers the opportunity to perform logistics
processes to a large extent without the presence of business partner master data.
However, a business partner master is practically essential for efﬁcient billing and
invoice management.
2.3
Master Data in Transport Logistics
31

You can create business partner master records for business partners of the
category Customer for a sold-to party, shipper and ship-to party of goods or for
payers. Supplier-type business partners can be deﬁned as forwarding agents,
carriers, customs agents or operators of load transfer sites. The respective role is
determined in the business partner master via the role deﬁnition function. You also
have the option of assigning more than one role to a partner (for instance, “General
Business Partner”, “Financial Services Business Partner” and “Payer”). Figure 2.11
shows the respective entries for such a business partner.
For every general business partner, you can enter the following information:
•
The main address of the business partner and additional addresses with notes
(such as that it is a postal address or delivery address)
•
Additional identiﬁcation numbers to identify a business partner (such as the IATA
agent code of an air freight service provider or Standard Carrier Alpha Code)
•
Business hours and tax classiﬁcation
•
Information regarding payment transactions with bank transfer data and pay-
ment card information
•
Status information and lock ﬂags
Business partner for new customers. If you have to accept an order by
telephone from a new customer for whom you do not yet have a business
partner master record, you can create a special business partner as a new
customer. You can then use it in a TM shipment order (shipment request) and
Fig. 2.11 Deﬁnition of a business partner SAP TM with several roles
32
2
Transport Logistics

provide it with the individual data from the order as a one-time address. After
the new business partner is centrally generated and distributed, the partner
New Customer can be easily replaced in the order.
2.3.3.1
Business Partner and Transportation Service Provider
Proﬁle for Vendors
Business partners that are deﬁned as transportation service providers require addi-
tional, logistics-relevant attributes for efﬁcient execution of transportation
planning, allocation, tendering and subcontracting in SAP TM. These attributes
deﬁne the authorization and service level of the service providers. You can maintain
a transportation service provider proﬁle with the following attributes for your
business partners:
•
Routes served in the transportation network
•
Types of goods handled, product freight and transport groups
•
Utilized/available transport equipment
•
Fixed and dimension-based transport costs for transportation optimization
You can deﬁne an employee of a business partner as the type Person, as
subordinate to a business partner. These employees are users in SAP TM for
Internet collaboration in the transport bid tendering process.
If you maintain organizational units in SAP TM (see Sect. 2.3.8, “Organizational
Data in SAP ERP and in SAP SCM”), a business partner of the type Organizational
Unit is automatically generated for each unit. You can use these business partners
directly in SAP TM to perform such tasks as recording the subcontract of a
transportation job to a local company.
2.3.4
Materials in SAP ERP
From the shipper view, the material master data deﬁned in SAP ERP includes the
deliverable, producible and sellable goods that a transport demand can produce in a
logistics process. The materials can be maintained here with their attributes and
various quantities, and allocated to organizations.
In addition, you can deﬁne various types of transport materials and equipment in
the material master (such as pallets, pallet cages and cardboard boxes), which can
also represent transport demand through their use in packaging one or more other
materials.
Packing hierarchy and transport demand. The actual transport demand
can be created on various levels. If 9,600 bags of ﬂour are to be sold and
transported, the transport demand might look like this:
2.3
Master Data in Transport Logistics
33

9,600 bags of ﬂour, 960 cardboard boxes, each containing 10 bags of ﬂour,
20 pallets of 48 cardboard boxes each or a 20-ft container with 20 pallets.
The bags and boxes of ﬂour each represent their own sales quantity unit,
and the pallets and containers are deﬁned as packaging materials.
The basic characteristics of the material master were described in Volume 1,
Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”. In this chapter, we refer to their transport-
speciﬁc attributes.
In addition to the obligatory deﬁnition of material number and description, you
also have to deﬁne the base unit of measure (such as count, box or kilogram). Via the
base unit, you can also deﬁne further quantity units with the conversion factors. The

indication of the gross and net weights as well as volume is especially important for
logistics processing, because these values are taken into account for the capacity
calculation of combined shipments. Volume refers to the volume occupied by a
material during transport, not the net contents of a unit of material (for instance, a
cardboard box with six 5-L canisters of a cleanser can have 40 L of volume).
Fig. 2.14 shows the material master maintenance screen in SAP ERP
In the material master, there is also a sales view in which you can deﬁne the
delivering plant and transportation group as transport-relevant attributes. The trans-
portation group is a categorization criterion that allows you to categorize materials
having the same deﬁned processing conditions. Examples for values in the transpor-
tation group include palleted goods, refrigerated goods or dairy products.
If the material is classiﬁed as dangerous goods, you need to create a dangerous goods
master record for transportation processing. The component EHS Management (Envi-
ronment, Health, and Safety) in SAP ERP lets you save the necessary identiﬁcations and
deﬁnitions for the various norms and carriers. Here, you can store dangerous goods
classes and codes, material characteristics, rules for loading together, paper print
deﬁnitions and other details for dangerous goods deﬁnition. A separate dangerous
goods master record must be created for each material classiﬁed as a dangerous good.

2.3.5
Products in SAP SCM
The product master data in SAP SCM, which is also be used by SAP TM, is of two
basic types:
1. Product master data that maps precisely deﬁned materials that are sold, pur-
chased or transported in connection with a logistics agreement
2. Product master data that constitutes a classiﬁcation or grouping of various
materials or represents a service
The ﬁrst type is generally used in shipper processing of transports (the exception
being contract logistics), and is similar to the material master deﬁnition of the ERP
system. It is employed in the traditional shipper solution and supported by APO
Transportation Planning or SAP TM.
The second type is the product view of a logistics service provider, in which the
situation regarding the product master is considerably more multifarious. You can
only effectively use this type of product master when employing SAP TM as a
service provider solution.
The following possibilities for using the product master exist:
•
Exactly deﬁned products in contract logistics
The deﬁnition of the product is done the same way as in the shipper view.
•
Standard material types and material groups
Standard material types or groups deﬁned by a company are used (for instance, a
commodity code) to accurately group and classify products.
•
Categories of transport equipment
Products only represent the outer packaging of the materials being transported.
•
No product master representation
All goods to be transported are only recorded as text in the transport request; all
load-speciﬁc and transport-relevant data is indicated directly in the order.
Transport service by a logistics service provider is often commissioned with
reference to standard material types or material groups as product master records.
Such grouping can be done in the necessary granularity (with three to eight digits),
using such elements as the commodity or HS (harmonized system) code, UN
hazardous materials number or other standards. The material group can be used
to deﬁne generally valid characteristics for all shipments with reference to a
particular material group (for example, freight group or description). Other data
(such as weight) can only be depicted in a general way, and must be individually
entered in the transport request.
In transport processes in which full loads are frequently requested and
transported (as in container line operation or railway operation with full rail cars),
the product master records are usually deﬁned based on transport equipment. The
content of the transport equipment is often only roughly speciﬁed and not precisely
known at the time of the initial order. However, the type of transport equipment
36
2
Transport Logistics

must be precisely deﬁned (for instance, a 20-ft standard container or a 67-ft, high-
sided gondola). The order then only states the desired number of transport equip-
ment products as the goods to be conveyed. More precise information on the nature
of the transported goods is added at a later time.
2.3.6
Transportation Network and Transport Equipment
in SAP ERP
The transportation network in SAP ERP is the basis for determining the transporta-
tion relevance of shipments and for route determination in ERP Transport. It
consists of three major elements: routes, legs and transportation connection points.
The route is a fairly detailed, possible transportation route that can consist of one
or more legs (see Fig. 2.12, Route DE_FR_SP), but which can also be deﬁned
without any geographic reference (see “Route England”). A route is characterized
by its route identiﬁcation and can contain the following attributes, among others:
•
Transportation service provider that executes a route
•
Shipping type along the route
•
Transit duration (total duration including breaks), pure travel duration (not
including breaks) and distance
•
Permissible total weight
•
For dangerous goods shipments, there is the option of including a transit country
table.
Route deﬁnition without a geographic reference enables you to conduct a pure
transit calculation for the shipment without referencing geographic circumstances.
For instance, you can deﬁne a route called North Atlantic in which you deﬁne
shipments from Europe to the United States with a transit time of 14 days. The ports
of departure and arrival remain undeﬁned. If you wish to deﬁne ports, you can
create one or more legs for that route.
A leg is either a connection between two transportation connection points or
an individual connection point via which a transportation activity is performed
(such as customs clearance). For each leg of a route, you can deﬁne a section type
(transportation, load transfer or border point), a shipping type, the distance, service
provider, travel and transit times as well as details on freight cost relevance.
Figure 2.13 shows you a sample route that follows part of Route DE_FR_SP
from Fig. 2.12.
A transportation connection point is a place where goods are dispatched,
received, transshipped or processed. Such processes can include activities like
customs clearance or railway car cleaning. For each transportation connection
point, you can deﬁne the type (e.g. load transfer point, airport or seaport), the
responsible customs ofﬁce, calendar and stopover time, as well as a reference to an
2.3
Master Data in Transport Logistics
37

organizational unit (such as a plant or shipping point), a partner (customer or
vendor) or any address.
Transport equipment is generated in SAP ERP as packaging materials (of the
material
type
VERP).
The
packaging
materials
deﬁne
the
capacity
and
characteristics of the means of transport that will subsequently be used in a handling
unit for a particular transaction.
2.3.7
Transportation Network and Resources in SAP SCM
The transportation network and resourcesare crucial for executing transportation
options. A transportation network represents the geographic circumstances for the
transportation of goods, and is modeled using locations, transportation lanes and
transportation zones.
Executing a transport is done with one’s own or third-party resources which
move the goods between locations in a transportation network along transportation
lanes. The following categories of resources are deﬁned in SAP SCM: vehicles with
capacity, tractor trucks, trailers, transportation units (containers, railway cars), and
handling resources for goods movement to locations and drivers. Itineraries, which
are a combination of transportation network and resource, are also signiﬁcant.
Figure 2.15 shows a schematic transportation network with the elements cited.

Locations are places in which goods are picked up, delivered or transshipped, or
in which activities relating to the transportation process are performed (such as
customs clearance). Each location is classiﬁed by its location type (for instance, a
production plant, distribution center, customer, vendor or terminal). In addition to
entering the description and address of a location, you have the option of entering
further contact details and a reference to a relevant business partner.
A location possesses a geolocation, that is, geographic coordinates used by the
transportation optimizer to calculate distances. You have the option of linking
geocoding software with the SAP SCM system to enable the coordinates of
created locations to be automatically determined with the added precision of the
geocoder (for instance, down to the town or street number). You can use various
geocoding software for a range of countries and regions to ﬁt your transportation
needs.
Other location attributes include:
•
Minimal transshipment times at locations used for shipment scheduling
•
Availability of handling resources such as the number of available forklifts at a
hub to load and unload goods
•
Alternative identiﬁcation, with which you can also deﬁne the UNLOCODE or
IATA airport code for the location
A transportation network generally includes several locations, which can be
grouped into transportation zones. This is done to aid in the selection process, and
to facilitate the deﬁnition of transportation lanes. There are three kinds of transpor-
tation zones:
•
A direct zone can be allocated to explicit locations.
•
A postal code zone contains all locations corresponding to the valid postal code
areas of a particular country. You can deﬁne these zones with variability (such as
ZIP 700xx-729xx and 750xx-753xx).
•
A region zone is deﬁned by entering a country and region, and contains all
locations in that region.
A mixed zone is a combination of the above zone types. It is created by entering
at least two different zone deﬁnitions.
For the selection process, it is possible to arrange the zones in a hierarchy. Figure2.15
shows the postal code zone DE-70 as a subzone of the regions DE-Southwest, which in
turn is a subzone of Germany. This hierarchy enables you to process all loads from the
areas of the city of Stuttgart, the state of Baden-W€urttemberg, or all of Germany.
Seen from the perspective of transportation planning, transshipment locations
are special locations in which goods are allowed to be transshipped from one
vehicle to another. A transshipment location can be deﬁned for every location. As
a rule, transshipment locations are distribution centers, ports, railway stations,
airports or similar places where a change in transit carrier (such as from a truck
to a ship) frequently takes place.
2.3
Master Data in Transport Logistics
39

Transshipment locations enable the targeted guidance of the ﬂow of goods via
deﬁned exit and entry locations. Figure 2.15 illustrates that goods transit from
Germany to the United States is either processed through the ports of Hamburg
and Boston or Hamburg and New York and that the pick-up and delivery trafﬁc in
the southwest of Germany is done through the distribution center in Frankfurt.
Transportation lanes deﬁne direct connections within a set of locations and
zones. They can be deﬁned between two locations (source and destination), a
location and a transportation zone, or between two transportation zones. Important
attributes of a transportation lane include a validity period, possible means of
transport, duration and distance, cost parameters and data related to transportation
service provider selection. Figure 2.15 shows an example of a transportation lane
between a distribution center in Frankfurt and the port in Hamburg, and between the
ports of Hamburg and Boston.
Of special signiﬁcance are intrazone lanes. They refer to the reachability of a
location within a zone from every other location. Thus, it is not necessary to create
individual transportation lanes between pairs of locations within a zone; it sufﬁces
to deﬁne one intrazone lane. For instance, in the transportation network shown in
Fig. 2.15, every location in southwestern Germany (within the zone DE-Southwest)
can be reached by the Frankfurt distribution center. Goods coming from Hamburg,
however, cannot reach Stuttgart directly, but must be transshipped in Frankfurt,
since Hamburg does not lie in the zone DE-Southwest.
As in the case of locations, you can also use an external system to determine
distances for transportation lanes. The distance and travel time of a transportation
lane between source and location and the selected distance plant is then automati-
cally determined using predeﬁned location coordinates.
Itineraries indicates a predeﬁned sequence of locations that serve as stops. They
are used for regular water travel, train travel and in road trafﬁc, such as for recurring
trips in retail supply or regular main legs in system transit.
The heading Resources within the context of transportation planning in SAP
SCM refers to all means of transport provided by a transportation capacity or the
ability to move a loaded transportation capacity. Every resource has an identiﬁca-
tion number and a calendar that deﬁnes when it is not available (its downtime).
Downtimes can occur due to such factors as maintenance or breaks. For transport
equipment, you can also deﬁne attributes such as means of transport, registration
number, owner, provided capacity (that is, how much can be loaded), consumed
capacity (that is, how much is utilized when the resource itself is loaded onto
another resource, such as when a container is loaded onto a truck), further equip-
ment (loading cranes, accompanying forklifts) and a home location (supply chain
unit). Via the means of transport, transportation lanes can be allocated.
Capacities can be maintained in a variety of dimensions, such as weight and
volume capacities. Several nondimensional capacities can also be maintained, such
as TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit for containers), loading meters and pallet
storing position.
As we have already mentioned, the following types of resources are among the
means of transport and transport equipment:
40
2
Transport Logistics

•
Vehicles with their own capacity
Vehicles with their own capacity are self-moving means of transport. Examples
include a 40-t truck, a container ship, a freighter ship, a container ship with 5,390
TEU or a cargo-model Airbus 340.
•
Tractor trucks
Tractor trucks do not have their own loading capacity, but are capable of moving
passive transportation capacities (such as trailers).
•
Trailers
Trailers have a transportation capacity (to the same extent as a vehicle resource),
but they must be combined with a tractor to execute a shipment. If a trailer is
available in transportation planning but not a tractor, the planning cannot
produce a result.
•
Transportation unit
Transportation units (containers, railway cars), like trailers, have a capacity but
cannot move autonomously. They have to be loaded onto a means of transport in
order to execute a shipment.
Other types of resources include:
•
Handling resources for goods movement in locations
Handling resources provide goods movement capacities in a location. Examples
include forklift operators, loading cranes, ﬁlling stations or trafﬁc congestion
workers. If, for example, only one forklift is available at a distribution center
having 10 loading ramps, a bottleneck would automatically be created that needs
to be considered during planning, since vehicles will have to wait longer for
loading and unloading.
•
Drivers
Drivers can be allocated to a planned shipment as a resource. As attributes, they
possess time availability and qualiﬁcation credentials such as a driver’s license
or dangerous goods permits.
In order to further increase the ﬂexibility of transportation resources, you can
deﬁne compartments for every resource into which certain goods can be loaded,
such as a truck with a dry and a refrigerated compartment or a tanker trailer with a
diesel and a gasoline compartment.
You can create vehicle combinations from several means of transport and
transport equipment elements. This would, for instance, enable you to combine
certain tractor trucks and trailers, which are usually moved together.
You have the option of creating a means of transport hierarchy. Special means
of transport can thus be made subordinate to generally deﬁned means of transport.
Since the characteristics of superior means of transport can be passed on to
subordinate means of transport, a hierarchy can be useful for easy description of
a transportation network. An example of a means of transport hierarchy would be a
12-t truck and a 40-t truck allocated to the superordinate means of transport
“Truck.” If you then allocate a transportation lane to “Truck,” both 12 and 40-t
trucks can be utilized without the need of further deﬁnitions.

The primary organizational element in the SAP ERP transportation solution is the
transportation planning point. It is deﬁned as an organizational unit of logistics that
is responsible for the planning and execution of transportation activities. The
transportation planning point organizes the responsibilities of a company into
such categories as the type of shipment, carrier or according to regional
departments. Thus, there can be a transportation planning point for New England
or the Midwestern United States, or in other companies, for truck and ship transit. In
addition to its function as a categorical and search criterion for shipment
documents, the transportation planning point, via its company code assignment,
enables logical allocation to the respective organizational areas in Accounting for
freight cost invoicing.
Further organizational units in SAP ERP logistics, such as the sales organization
or distribution channel, are only signiﬁcant to sales and delivery processing, but are
not utilized in ERP Transportation.
In SAP TM, the organizational structures are realized via SAP Organizational
Management. It allows you to set up the organizational structure of your company
in a ﬂexible manner. In the simplest case, this means individual employees who
perform various functions. In a larger enterprise or a logistics service provider,
various organizational areas are needed:
•
Sales organization (logistics service provider-speciﬁc)
The sales organization structures the sale of logistics services and executes them.
It can have several sales groups and sales ofﬁces as suborganizations. You can
also allocate information to distribution channels and divisions. In SAP TM, the
following processes, among others, are related to a sales organization:
– Quotation generation
– Order acceptance
– Contracting of freight transit
– Invoicing of sold freight services
•
Sales organization
The sales organization
executes all sales procedures pertaining to logistics
services of freight forwarders and carriers. It can have several purchasing
groups. The following processes are among those related to sales organizations
in SAP TM:
– The sale and subcontracting of freight services
– The purchase of freight capacity
– Tendering of freight services
– Contracting of freight purchasing
– The settlement of purchased freight services
42

•
Planning and execution organization
The planning and execution organization arranges the planning and allocation of
accepted shipping orders and the shipments to be transported, and performs any
necessary activities or monitors them if they are subcontracted. The following
procedures are related to planning and execution organization in SAP TM:
– The distribution of regional and mode-speciﬁc planning responsibilities
– MRP and transportation planning
– The management of transportation resources
Figure 2.16 shows a comparison of these organizational structures with regard to
transportation in SAP ERP and in SAP TM. APO Transportation Planning is a
planning tool that is not dependent on an organizational deﬁnition.
Because no direct relationship to ﬁnance-related classiﬁcation objects exists in
SAP TM (such as to company codes, accounts or internal orders), for purposes of
invoicing, organizational data is transferred to the ERP system or a connected
account settlement system for ﬁnancial allocation.
When SAP TM is used with SAP ERP as an account settlement system, you can
set up analogous organizational systems in both systems to achieve a coherent
categorization of sales and purchasing structures.

Transportation Management with SAP ERP
Transportation management in the SAP ERP Logistics Execution System (compo-
nent LE-TRA) was developed as a traditional shipper solution primarily geared
toward the transportation needs of SAP customers who also employ the modules for
sales and distribution (SD) and procurement logistics (part of Materials Manage-
ment, MM) (see Fig. 2.5).
Starting with sales orders in your Sales Department or purchase orders in
Procurement Logistics, one or more delivery documents are generated that are to
be allocated as transport demand. In ERP Transportation Management, you can
now create one or more delivery documents that contain deliveries as shipments.
SAP ERP planning tools can provide for efﬁcient processing in this regard.
Although optimized planning functionality is not a part of ERP Transportation
Management, you can use external planning systems or SAP APO if optimization is
desired. After transportation planning, you can create a freight cost document for
every shipment document, which allows you to calculate and invoice service
provider costs.
The main steps involved in SAP ERP Transportation Management include:
1. Determination of shipment types, carrier and means of transport
2. Execution of transportation planning and delivery allocation
3. Determination of transportation routes and stages
4. Planning of shipping dates
5. Determination of the forwarding agent, invitation of bids to and commissioning
of forwarders
6. Deﬁnition of transportation packaging
7. Entering of transport details, texts and further partners
8. Printing of shipping and transfer documents
9. Posting of goods issue for shipments to be transported
10. Transmission of electronic notiﬁcation regarding shipment
11. Determination and settlement of freight costs
All of these steps are possible with multiple modes of transport.
2.4.1
Types of Transportation Processing
In SAP ERP Transportation Management, you can process several types of
shipments that are all supported by targeted transaction control functions. The
most important types of transportation processing are:
•
Individual shipment with a single carrier as a direct carriage
A single shipment or set of shipments with the identical pick-up and delivery
locations is transported by one vehicle directly from the pick-up location to the
destination.
44
2
Transport Logistics

•
Consolidated shipment with a single carrier
Several shipments with various pick-up and destination locations are delivered
with one vehicle in a sequence (delivery sequence) from their respective pick-up
locations and delivered to their destinations.
•
Transportation chain with several carriers
One or more shipments are transported with several carriers sequentially (for
example, truck – cargo ship – truck). Separate shipment documents are
generated for each carrier, each of which displays the respective carriage
identiﬁcation (pre-carriage, main carriage and on-carriage). The transportation
management system uses its process control to make sure a shipment is
completely planned and allocated only when a seamless chain of individual
shipments has been created in which that particular shipment is contained.
Figure 2.17 shows such a transportation chain with two pre-carriages, two on-
carriages and one common main carriage.
•
Empty run
A vehicle is transported empty from a source location to a destination.
•
Return shipment
Return shipment is a special type of processing for the transportation of return
deliveries.
2.4.2
Shipment Documents
Shipment documents are frequently generated manually in SAP ERP. In every
shipment document, there is a set of obligatory data that serves to control processes

and authorization behavior. The most important attributes that have to be deﬁned
when the document is created include:
•
Transportation planning point
Organizational unit responsible for the planning and processing of a shipment.
The transportation planning point is allocated to a company code in the ERP
system for cost accounting purposes.
•
Shipment type
Classiﬁcation of the shipment with regard to carrier, means of transport and
carriage identiﬁcation (pre-carriage, main carriage, on-carriage and direct car-
riage). The shipment type as a central control attribute enables the following
functions to be controlled in the shipment document, each of which can be
conﬁgured in Customizing:
– Number assignment for shipment documents (number range)
– Text type deﬁnition, that is, what kinds of texts can be entered
– Printed documents and electronic messages
– The way to determine shipment stages (route determination), setting the way
stages are adopted
– The determination of attributes (such as individual or combined shipments)
– Loading and packing functions
When you enter these two criteria, a new shipment document opens so that you
can continue data entry. However, transportation planning points and means of
transport cannot be subsequently changed. Figure 2.18 shows an overview of an
ERP shipment document.
Important data that you can deﬁne and enter in the shipment document is
explained below:
•
What is to be transported? – Shipment items (deliveries)
The shipment items are references to the deliveries to be allocated in the
respective shipment. Each shipment must contain at least one delivery, other-
wise it cannot be actively processed further. The delivery data is not copied
directly into the shipment document, but rather read via a reference from the
delivery. As such, for instance, the shipment weight will change if the weight of
one of the contained deliveries changes. Each delivery can only be completely
allocated to a shipment. Parts of deliveries cannot be allocated (see also
Sect. 2.4.4, “Important Functions in the Shipment Document”). In such a case,
a delivery split is necessary.
•
Along what route will the shipment run? – Transportation route and stages
The transportation route is an organizational criterion that describes the basic
route of the shipment. It can be used for searches, for instance, to determine all
shipments along a route in the next 3 days.The route can also provide informa-
tion on the physical path if the route deﬁnition includes legs (see also Sect. 2.3.6,
“Transportation Network and Transport Equipment in SAP ERP”). These legs
are then assumed in the shipment as stages. Further stages can be deﬁned, such
46
2
Transport Logistics

as for pick-up by the shipper or delivery to the goods recipient (see Fig. 2.19). In
every stage, you can indicate the departure and destination location, shipping
type, freight forwarder, distance and duration, as well as other data.
•
Who is shipping? – Freight forwarder
You can deﬁne a primary freight forwarder for the execution of a shipment on
the overview screen. The forwarder must be deﬁned as a supplier in the supplier
master. Using the copying control, it is possible to copy a freight forwarder from
a delivery document, if that delivery is allocated to a particular shipment.
Depending on the forwarder selected, freight costs can be subsequently deter-
mined. A further use of the freight forwarder ﬁeld is for tendering. Here, the
freight forwarder serves as the recipient of bid invitation information and can
either accept or decline the shipment job. For each shipment stage, you can
indicate another forwarder for local performance.
Fig. 2.18 Overview of a shipment document in the SAP ERP logistics execution system
Fig. 2.19 Stages in an ERP shipment document
2.4
Transportation Management with SAP ERP
47

•
When is the shipment to be executed? – Dates
On the total shipment level (shipment header), you can deﬁne the planned dates
and times for the following process steps:
– Registration (arrival of the means of transport at the place of loading)
– Loading start
– Loading end
– Shipment completion (departure of the loaded means of transport at the ﬁrst
place of loading)
– Transportation start
– Transportation end
You can also enter free dates that can be used to schedule other process steps.
•
Where are we in the shipping process? – Shipment status
The shipment status values are closely related to the current dates on the header
of the shipment document. The schedule information indicated also includes a
space for a date and time in which you can document the current status by either
entering data or pressing a button. This sets the current date as well as displays
the shipment status (e.g. Completed). In addition to the seven dates named
above, the Status area also shows the current Planned date. By deﬁning the
status as Planned, the shipment is set in the planning.
Shipment status “Planned”. The shipment status Planned causes the ship-
ment to become a ﬁxed part of the transportation planning. This means you no
longer have the opportunity to add or remove freight units from a shipment. In
order to do so, you have to suspend the Planned status, which you can do with
the simple push of a button.
•
With whom are we working? – Partners
The freight forwarder has already been named as the most important transporta-
tion business partner. In the Partner view of the shipment document, you can
maintain further business partners, such as customs agents, cleaning agencies or
packing service providers.
2.4.3
Transport Packaging
Similar to delivery processing, in transportation processing, you also have the
option of deﬁning packaging for the goods to be transported. This packaging can
be simple or have multiple levels. In contrast to packaging in a delivery document, a
shipment document allows you to assign packaging to more than one delivery, that
is, several freight units can be assigned to a single transportation packaging.
Packaging in the shipment document is done as it is in the delivery document,
with the aid of handling units (see Volume 1, Chap. 6, “Distribution Logistics”, and
Volume 2, Chap. 3, “Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management”). If you
48
2
Transport Logistics

assign deliveries that are already packed (such as a delivery of three Euro-pallet
handling units) to a shipment document, you will see the delivery handling units in
the shipment document packing section and can pack these units further.
You can use transport equipment (such as pallets, sacks, crates, pallet cages or
containers) as well as means of transport (like trucks, trailers, ships or railway cars)
as transportation packaging. Depending on the packaging material types and
capacities, you can then pack one into another.
2.4.4
Important Functions in the Shipment Document
In addition to editing the shipment document and its data, you can make use of
helpful tools in ERP Transportation Management to support your processing
efforts:
•
Transportation planning
•
Route determination
•
Subsequent freight unit split
•
Transportation tendering
•
Freight cost estimation
•
Shipment tracking
•
Graphical shipment information system
For your transportation planning needs, you have access to a planning list with
which you can freely select and allocate deliveries from a delivery due list for
existing or new shipment documents (see Fig. 2.20). At that point or a later time,
you can select criteria deﬁned by you (such as all unplanned deliveries that must
leave Hamburg for northern Germany the next day). In the Planning screen, you can
create new shipment documents. The deliveries can either be individually or
Fig. 2.20 Planning list with delivery allocations to shipments
2.4
Transportation Management with SAP ERP
49

collectively allocated to the shipment documents using the drag-and-drop function.
For every individual shipment document, you can branch to its overview screen and
edit details from there.
Interactive transportation planning. In Fig. 2.20, you can see an example
of the interactive transportation planning screen. An existing shipment with a
delivery was augmented by two other shipments ($0001, $0002), each of
which has a delivery allocated to it. The temporary shipment numbers ($)
indicate that documents have not yet been saved. In the delivery queue (in the
illustration below), there are further deliveries that have not yet been planned.
Route determination is a function that you can start manually or automatically
when the status Planned is set (see Fig. 2.21).
Starting with the details on the transport route and route determination settings in
the shipment type, a route is generated according to the sequence of shipment
stages. Subsequently, a stage sequence is generated that serves all pick-up locations
Fig. 2.21 Route determination in the ERP shipment document
50
2
Transport Logistics

before the route is begun. At the end of the route, further stages are added that lead
to all ship-to parties. Following the route determination process, you have the
opportunity to interactively alter the order of the stops along the route before the
actual shipment stages are generated.
Route determination result. Figure 2.21 shows the result of route determi-
nation for a shipment of three deliveries (from Dresden to Frankfurt and
Munich), for which no legs are deﬁned.
Sometimes a vehicle cannot be loaded in such a way as planned in the transpor-
tation plan, because, for example, the dimensions of the vehicle or the load were
incorrectly entered. In such a case, you can perform a subsequent freight unit split,
to divide a partial delivery into a new freight unit. If, for instance, the rear door of a
truck cannot be closed because the last two pallets are hanging out of the back of the
truck by 5 cm, you can use the subsequent freight unit split function to reassign
those pallets as a new delivery, to which you can allocate another shipment
document. Then the two pallets can be unloaded. When the documents are printed
out, you will then receive the correct shipping documents and the planning situation
in the system corresponds to what has taken place.
Transportation tendering serves to obtain an offer from one or more freight
forwarding agents. In order to perform the tendering process, the shipment docu-
ment must indicate at least one stage and one deﬁned freight forwarder, and have
the status Planned. You can indicate the tender details and a target price in the
tendering data. To determine a target price, you can use the freight cost estimation
function, which you can access from the shipment overview screen. The freight cost
estimation tool uses the shipment data to perform a cost estimation without,
however, generating a freight cost document in the database (see Sect. 2.4.6,
“Freight Cost Calculation”). Instead, the costs are temporarily calculated and
presented as a decision-making aid in the context of the shipment document.
A bid invitation is then transmitted to the freight forwarder named in the shipment
document header, either by sending a bid invitation message or placing it on a
tendering portal, where the forwarder has direct access to the bid invitations directed
at him. The forwarder can accept the bid invitation, accept it with alterations (such as
an altered pick-up time) or reject it. He can also suggest a purchase price. The
transportation planner can then check the tendering status in the ERP shipment
document and either award the contract or send a bid invitation to another forwarder.
A freight exchange can also be used as a forwarding agent. This enables the
transport demand to be placed on an open or closed marketplace for transportation
services. If the offer is accepted by a forwarding agent or carrier on that market, that
offer is assumed in the shipment document with the carrier’s name, so that it is
obvious who will perform the transport.
The ERP shipment document is linked to an event management process for the
tracking of shipments. If a shipment document is created and given the status
2.4
Transportation Management with SAP ERP
51

Planned, the individual milestones and attributes of the shipment are transferred to
Event Management, where they are used to generate an event handler. This event
handler allows the status of the shipment to be tracked based on status messages that
are transmitted via EDI, mobile device, the Internet or manual entry. The status
messages can be viewed with a comparison of target/actual values in the tracking
view of the shipment document. The standard process generates an event handler
for the shipment and monitors all scheduled processing, departure and arrival dates
of that shipment. If conﬁgured accordingly, you also have the option of tracking
individual freight units or packaging units (such as pallets or containers) of the
transport. More information on the topic of Event Management can be found in
Chap. 5, “Controlling and Reporting”.
2.4.5
List Processing and Planning Functions
SAP ERP Transportation Management offers a selection of lists and collective
functions to ensure an efﬁcient overview and processability of your inventory of
transport demands and shipment documents.
The transportation planning list (see Fig. 2.22) allows you to easily obtain an
overview of all pending shipments possessing certain criteria. For example, it is
possible to have the system display a list of all shipment documents that were
generated the day before (date) from the Hamburg distribution center (departure
location) as a road shipment (shipment type) but which have not yet been
completely planned (do not have the status Planned). Using that work list, you
can continue processing individual shipments in a targeted manner by following a
link in the list that branches to the document editing screen. After editing a
document, you can return to the list.
To enable more efﬁcient transportation planning and allocation, you can employ
the transportation planning collective run. Using it, you can select targeted trans-
port demands (deliveries) for the collective run and conﬁgure it, thus automatically
generating shipment documents. In addition to the generation of direct shipments,
you can also create transportation chains.
The distribution of the transport demands to the individual shipments is done
heuristically, and the system attempts to optimally utilize allocated maximum
Fig. 2.22 SAP ERP transportation planning list
52
2
Transport Logistics

shipment amounts (such as truck load capacities). However, unlike in SAP TM,
optimization does not place. The result of the collective run is presented in a report
detailing the individual steps and results.
If you have created several shipment documents and need to make the same
targeted changes to a large number of documents (such as changing the freight
forwarder), you can use the Mass Maintenance transaction for shipments (see
Fig. 2.23).
In Mass Maintenance, as in the case of the planning list, you can initially select
shipment documents to be edited that have certain criteria. You can then select the
shipments to be changed from a results list and edit them via the various tabs, such
as process data, identiﬁcation, durations and distances, schedules and other data.
The changes are then adopted for the shipment documents marked.
Other work lists and overview lists available include a capacity list and a list for
available freight room, with which you can evaluate a selection of shipments either
based on their utilized or free capacity and process them further, as is done in the
planning list.
2.4.6
Freight Cost Calculation
Freight cost calculation, which primarily deals with the calculation and settlement
of the freight costs of service providers, has long been a component of Transporta-
tion Processing. It includes the following basic steps:
•
Generation of freight agreements and prices
•
Calculation of freight costs
•
Settlement of freight costs with service providers
Fig. 2.23 Mass maintenance transaction of shipment documents
2.4
Transportation Management with SAP ERP
53

•
Transfer of costs to Financial Accounting
•
Transfer of freight costs to customers who generate transport demand (customer
freight billing)
•
Accrual of reserves for expected freight costs
Figure 2.24 illustrates the respective steps in a graph.
The freight cost documents generated from the shipment documents and their
follow-on documents (such as service entry sheets and invoices) are linked with one
another via the document ﬂow, such that you can easily link from one shipment
document to its freight cost document and other documents. From the document
ﬂow screen, you can open the respective documents. Figure 2.25 shows the
document ﬂow of a shipment document up to the invoice receipt.
A freight cost document can be generated from every shipment document. Thus,
there is always a one-to-one ratio between the two document types. The
prerequisites for generating a freight cost document are:
•
The shipment must be identiﬁed as freight-cost relevant.
•
The shipment must have the necessary overall status set in the deﬁnition of
freight cost type.
•
The shipment must at least have the status of Planned.
•
The shipment must have a service provider.

The freight cost document contains header information, item information and
subitems:
•
Freight cost header
In the freight cost header, you will ﬁnd data pertaining to the freight cost type,
document status and pricing date, as well as reference data and the processing
report.
•
Freight cost item
This contains information on the item category, business partner (freight for-
warder), utilized pricing procedure, the pricing date, tax amounts, settlement
dates and references to the shipment and the service entry sheet. One freight cost
item might, for instance, include costs for the total shipment (document charges,
insurance), while another might indicate costs for the pre-carriage or main
carriage.
•
Freight cost subitem
The freight cost subitems provide information on the calculation basis used and
the calculation result, tax rates and references to the deliveries or freight units.
With regard to the calculated costs, the freight cost document offers several
views that you can display depending on what information you need:
•
An overview of all freight cost items and the calculated costs
•
Costs per delivery item
•
Costs per shipment stage
Figure 2.26 provides an overview of the freight cost document item view.
Figure 2.27 shows the conditions of a freight cost item in detail, which illuminates
the pricing procedure and tax determination.
You can deﬁne the automated processing of transportation information in freight
documents with the respective customizing settings. The following process steps
can be automated:

for the calculation of freight costs for a combined shipment from San
Francisco via Detroit to New York. Two deliveries are transported, but they
are only transported together in the ﬁrst stage.
Fig. 2.26 Overview of the freight cost document
Fig. 2.27 Item and condition detail in the freight cost document
56

Transport Logistics

Settlement of costs is conducted with two service providers: a forwarding
agent and an insurance company. The insurance costs represent a separate
freight cost item with reference to the complete shipment. Two further items
were generated for the stages; the costs for the ﬁrst stage are calculated from
the total freight of both shipments (subitems 2.1 and 2.2). The total freight of
10,000 kg is used to determine the scaled value of $0.40/kg.
The calculation, scaled values, applied individual conditions per shipment and other
special calculations can be conﬁgured using Customizing and master data maintenance.
Scales can be created and maintained in multiple dimensions. They can be deﬁned as
from-scales, to-scales or with an exact value. Table 2.2 presents an example of a three-
dimensional scale table at a price per kilogram with the dimensions “From ZIP code”
area and “To ZIP code” area as exact scale values and “Weight” as a to-scale value.
For the calculation procedure and schemes, special forms of freight calculation
are also taken into consideration, such as:
•
Shortest main carriage
The costs are always calculated such that as short a main carriage as possible
(direct carriage) is assumed.
•
Minimum and maximum value for freight cost conditions
For example, a freight price of $11.80 per ton with a minimum of $35.
•
Average weight calculation
If using the next scale up is cheaper, this value is used (for example, 9 t at
$120 ¼ $1,080 is replaced by 10 t at $100 ¼ $1,000).

Freight comparisons
Conditions of a pricing procedure can be summarized in groups. These groups
are then each calculated and then compared. The freight calculation can, for
example, always select the least expensive group (such as: the freight calculation
can either be done according to weight or volume).
Before the actual calculation, freight cost calculation ﬁrst determines a pricing
procedure per freight cost item for the calculation, determined in relation to the
transportation planning point, service provider, freight cost item and shipping type.
An important criterion for the calculation is the calculation base, that is, the level
on which individual freight prices are determined. You can employ the following
levels in freight calculation as a calculation base:
•
For each shipment stage
•
For each shipping unit
•
For every shipment
•
For every delivery item under consideration of the freight classes (that is, goods
type-speciﬁc)
Geographic circumstances of a shipment are determined in freight cost calcula-
tion by one of two options:
•
Distances
You can manually enter the distance into the shipment stage or shipment header,
or it is automatically assumed from the leg.
•
Locations and zones
A few pieces of information from the address data in the shipment document
(such as country, ZIP code, transportation zone), divided into departure and
destination locations, can be used for cost determination. Based on this informa-
tion, a price zone can also be determined, such as one that combines several
locations within a ZIP code.
The pricing and billing data can be automatically determined. Using deﬁnable
scheduling rules, you can set a series of transportation dates that can serve as
recommendations. For the calculation of freight costs, you can also have the system
automatically determine the respective tax.
In the functional area Freight invoicing, work lists are available that can give
you an overview of the current operation queue.
The freight cost calculation list is a report that can be used to list freight cost
documents for which the calculation has not yet been completed. You have such
selection criteria as the status of the calculation, the date of the calculation and the
pricing date to limit the selection of freight cost documents.
The list of scales allows you to obtain an overview of the existing scales and their
applications. With the freight cost invoicing list (see Fig. 2.29), you have the
opportunity to search for freight cost documents that have already been or must
soon be settled.

If you as a shipper wish to transfer freight costs that you have paid to a service
provider for the transport of goods stemming from a sales order to an ordering party,
you have the option of performing customer freight invoicing. For this, through
special conditions on the invoice of the sales order, the conditions of the freight
invoice are accessed, and the individual cost elements can be assumed in the
invoice of the purchasing document. This can be done without making any changes,
but you can also apply a proportional charge or surcharge. The ordering party then
receives an invoice for the freight costs together with the material costs.

Transportation Planning with SAP APO
As mentioned in the previous section, the ERP transportation solution itself offers
no option for optimized transportation planning, since SAP ERP does not include
planning tools with an optimization function. In several cases, however, optimized
planning is a method with which to improve efﬁciency and save money.
That is why Supply Chain Management includes the planning and optimization
component APO (Advanced Planner and Optimizer). In combination with ERP
logistics processes, it offers a few signiﬁcant advantages for transportation
planning:
•
Integration of order processing, global availability check and transporta-
tion planning
You have the option of optimizing the availability of products in all international
divisions of your company as well as the planning of shipments between
corporate locations and customers or suppliers in a combined process.
•
Cost-optimized transportation planning
The optimization process for shipments offers efﬁcient models and strategies to
inﬂuence overall transportation costs.

2.5
Transportation Planning with SAP APO

•
Multiple transportation mode planning
Optimization can be performed using several modes of transport, that is, you can
plan complete transportation chains including transshipment in several distribu-
tion centers.
APO Transportation Planning (TP/VS) can be employed for purchasing as well
as sales-based processes (see the process ﬂow diagram for the sales side in Fig. 2.7).
2.5.1
Transportation Optimization with SAP APO (TP/VS)
The basic process when working with APO Transportation Planning consists of the
following elements:
1. The documents that form the original transport demand (sales orders, purchase
orders) are created in the ERP system and subsequently transferred to the APO
system.
2. In the event that the Routing Guide (dynamic route determination) is used, a
planning run is performed during the global availability check before the sales
order is saved.
3. Vehicle Scheduling (VS) aids you in achieving a consolidation of transport
demands and determining an optimal route and delivery sequence and creating
the corresponding tours. It considers optimal resource exploitation as well as
minimal procedural effort (such as for loading and unloading). Existing
solutions can be taken into account for further planning runs and revised based
on altered situations.
4. For service provider selection, you have the option of optimizing the allocation
of transportation service providers to existing tours according to cost, distribu-
tion, quality or quota processing aspects. You can also determine additional
shipments, to save money by dispatching two shipments at one time.
5. Collaborative transportation planning with service providers enables you to
exchange data relating to expected transportation volume. You can provide
service providers with short- and long-term planning data for your transport
demands via a collaboration portal, to enable them to prepare enough transport
capacity.
6. Shipment tendering serves to communicate planned shipments to service
providers and, if necessary, plan for any requests for changes or rejections.
7. Release shipments can be transmitted back to SAP ERP after optimization and
service provider allocation. Based on the data, ERP shipment documents and
deliveries are then generated.
8. Transportation processing subsequently takes place in ERP Transportation
Management.
The Optimizer in APO Transportation Planning is a universal tool for planning
comprehensive transport scenarios.
60

2.5.2
Documents and Transportation Optimization
APO Transportation Planning primarily works with two transaction objects: The
freight unit and the shipment document. Freight units represent transport demands
created from sales orders or purchase orders. With the aid of master data objects
such as resources, service providers and transportation lanes, freight units are
planned in a planning run, consolidated and allocated to shipments. These
shipments mainly correspond to tours that service several loading and unloading
points and are processed with one resource.
Planning itself can either be performed in batch processing, as a report or as
interactive planning with optimization support. Figure 2.30 shows an overview of
the TP/VS planning cockpit, where you can select various planning views (resource
view, shipment view, tabular planning, planning board, etc.).
The Optimizer is a software tool integrated into APO Transportation Planning
via interfaces. Since the Optimizer was not developed in the SAP programming
language ABAP, but rather in C++, it only supports selected operating system
platforms (such as Windows and Linux). The Optimizer gets its data and results are
provided via the preliminary and subsequent processing of master and movement
data in Supply Chain Management.
The Optimizer conducts continual optimization of the transportation scenario
under consideration of indicated transport demands, resources, incompatibilities,
cost functions and transportation networks, until either a preset optimization dura-
tion has been reached or two sequential solutions have not resulted in an improve-
ment in the overall result. As such, the Optimizer can provide a result at a very early
stage – even if that result is still suboptimal. The progress of the optimization
process can be monitored and checked in the optimization screen (see Fig. 2.31).
After optimization has been performed, the generated shipments can be analyzed
and adjusted in the planning cockpit. The system also provides an overview
planning board to help you evaluate not only the capacity-related but also the
Fig. 2.30 Planning cockpit of SAP APO transportation planning
2.5

61

time-lapse-related aspects. It allows you to display the time lapse of the individual
shipments in Gantt diagrams and evaluate them. For this, you have access to an
order-based as well as a resource-based time display. Such displays clearly illus-
trate what resources are available or occupied at what times (see Fig. 2.32).
2.5.3
Scenarios with APO Transportation Planning
Multi-pick and multi-drop scenarios involve the optimization of load consolidation
with regard to resources. In an overall scenario in which freight is picked up and
dropped off at several loading points, transportation costs for resource employment
is minimized, that is, the most economical resource selection and load combination
is determined.
In order to be able to properly evaluate these networks, you can use the Supply
Chain Cockpit tool, which provides a graphic display of network components such
as plants, customers, suppliers, resources and transportation lanes in map form.
Such a network in the Supply Chain Cockpit is shown in Fig. 2.33.

The Routing Guide (dynamic route determination) is a planning tool that allows
you to perform a complete transportation planning job including an integrated
availability check directly during data entry.
Multi-modal planning with transshipment at terminals and load transfer points is
supported, to achieve as realistic a process as possible. Based on the order data, the
Routing Guide can generate several possible transportation plans and present the
user with a solution list enabling interactive decisions.
The option of integrated service provider determination also makes it possible to
establish the real freight costs for every transportation solution and present them in
the decision-making process, using a special interface to ERP Transportation
Management. The ERP system only temporarily generates shipment and freight
cost documents to perform the calculation.
After the desired transportation route has been selected and the sales order saved,
the shipment documents pertaining to the selected solution are also saved in the
APO system. Transportation solutions that are not selected are automatically
discarded. Figure 2.34 provides a graphic depiction of the dynamic route determi-
nation process.
Dynamic route determination can also be used as a simulation directly within the
context of APO Transportation Planning. For this, you can open the transaction for

interactive route determination and directly enter the freight unit data. The planning
function then immediately presents the desired route recommendation as a result.
They are displayed in the transaction as shown in Fig. 2.35.
A Continuous move (additional shipment determination) allows you to optimally
combine matching individual shipments that you can contract to a single service
provider. This enables you to book longer freight routes per service provider and
vehicle, often achieving a better freight price. This is especially true if you can offer
the service provider return freight from the drop-off location of the ﬁrst shipment.
Multiple ERP use of APO Transportation Planning. Multiple ERP use of
a transportation planning system is a scenario that is necessary from time to
time when several organizations of a company use their own ERP systems for
order processing but plan transportation with a central planning system. The
generated shipments then contain deliveries from several ERP systems but
are only mapped in a single ERP system.
Unfortunately, this scenario cannot be executed with ERP Transportation Man-
agement and APO Transportation Planning without system modiﬁcations and
extensions, since the necessary delivery references cannot be consistently mapped
in the central ERP transportation system. SAP TM should be used for such scenarios.
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM
SAP TM is a software solution with which you can process transportation logistics
processes in complex transportation networks. It supports you in basic business
processes, ranging from the sales offer and order to planning, subcontracting and

pricing to invoicing and settlement of transportation services. The solution is
equipped with algorithms for shipment optimization and route determination
SAP TM is part of the supply chain management solution of SAP and is
integrated with SAP ERP for ﬁnancial settlement. In addition to SAP ERP, SAP
Event Management is also employed for various tracking processes.
One signiﬁcant difference to ERP Transportation Management is a strong
emphasis on transportation processing from the service provider view and not
only as a partial process of sales and distribution, production or procurement.
Transportation is treated as an autonomous process that begins with the tendering
procedure and ends with invoicing and settlement. In comparison with SAP ERP,
SAP TM offers a considerable amount of additional functions:
•
The opportunity to handle transportation processes with or without material
master records
•
Customer master data is not necessary (however it is helpful for invoicing);
supports one-time customers
•
Sales and purchase order management for transportation services
•
Expanded functions for planning and allocation of complete and partial
shipments in complex and also itinerary-supported networks
•
Partial processing of transportation chains
•
Division of the processing of a transportation order between various participating
organizations (import/export view)
•
Incoming and outgoing shipments are treated equally, which enables the
planning of round trips with drop-offs and pick-ups
•
Complex debit- as well as credit-related freight rate calculation and support of
internal costs for a company’s own ﬂeet
•
Calculation of the proﬁtability of orders
•
Support of EDI communication
•
Complete transportation processing, even in multiple ERP environments
With SAP TM, SAP addresses existing markets, such as the shipper market, for
which transportation processing had previously been the realm of SAP ERP, as well
as the logistics service provider market, a new area for SAP.
2.6.1
Document and Process Overview
The documents and business objects in SAP TM are geared toward an efﬁcient,
service-oriented and distributed transportation management. That is why SAP TM
not only includes one shipment document, such as in SAP ERP, but rather several
application-oriented objects, each of which serves a special purpose in the realm of
transportation processing. Figure 2.36 shows an overview of the business objects
and their related subprocesses.

The overall process in SAP TM is divided into ﬁve major subprocesses and
organizational functional areas:
•
Order Management
Order Management and order acceptance mark the beginning of an operative
process in transportation management. When a transportation order is awarded,
a contract is created between the customer and a transportation service provider.
This process can take place within a company (such as a producing company that
awards a transportation contract to its logistics department) as well as between
companies (an order to a logistics service provider). Order acceptance is the
most important function of Order Management in SAP TM.
•
Transportation planning
Transportation planning consolidates shipments into cargo loads under consid-
eration of predeﬁned conditions, such as volume, desired arrival time or com-
patibility of means of transport and goods to be transported. The planner also has
the option of manual planning. In addition to transportation optimization,
planning also enables the selection of a transportation service provider. In this
step, the system aids in ﬁnding the most economical transportation service
provider to execute a transport.
•
Subcontracting and tendering
Subcontracting is consigning transportation services to a shipper or carrier. The
process includes transportation planning and consists of the further processing
and forwarding to service providers of transport orders stemming from planning
results. If several service providers are eligible for a subcontracting job, a
tendering procedure can be performed. A second form of subcontracting is the
booking of freight space, wherein freight space capacity is reserved and used in
the course of further transportation planning. As soon as a freight space booking
order is received, the shipment order consumes a portion of the volume of the
booking.Booking as well as freight orders can be printed. In the realm of freight
forwarding, these documents come in the form of a bill of lading (B/L) or master
air waybill (MAWB).
•
Freight cost management
Freight cost management (TCM, Transportation Charge Management) can
calculate debits as well as credits. It consists of several subcomponents that
ﬁrst determine all cost- and revenue-related logistics data and provide it to the
calculation program. The program uses conﬁguration settings to determine
pricing calculation procedures and components along with the relative scales.
Thus, even complex installment structures can be mapped in Transportation
Management.
•
Settlement
Freight cost settlement links freight calculation with ERP Financing on the debit
side and ERP Purchasing on the credit side.
Within these components, the system determines to which accounts, cost
centers, etc., the freight order is to be booked. It can also perform allocation duties,
such as distributing costs among all participating cost centers.
68

Transport Logistics

2.6.2
Cross-Divisional Functions
One signiﬁcant characteristic of SAP TM is the option of distributing a general
process among several processing employees. This enables various people in
different organizations to perform transportation processing steps.
Two functions in SAP TM are used to do this:
•
The Personal Object Worklist (Personal Object Worklist, POWL)
•
SAP authorization control
The Personal Object Worklist is the central element for role-speciﬁc user access
in SAP TM. Its basic elements are conﬁgurable queries and work lists. Depending
on functional area, the Personal Object Worklist offers you access to the business
objects and their directly subsequent business objects, such as:
•
Personal Object Worklist for sales orders
•
Personal Object Worklist for shipment requests (transport orders)
•
Personal Object Worklist for tours
•
Personal Object Worklist for shipment orders
•
Personal Object Worklist for customer freight invoice requests (pro-forma
customer invoice)
Depending on the business object and area, you have the opportunity to display,
create, edit or delete objects.
You can conﬁgure POWLs for each user or for a user group through an
administrator. This allows every user access to exactly those work lists with the
objects that he or she needs upon entering the work area (such as order manage-
ment). Figure 2.37 shows an example of the Personal Object Worklist for shipment
orders.
Fig. 2.37 Personal Object Worklist of a booking agent
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM
69

The Personal Object Worklist can be conﬁgured by users in several ways and
customized to task-speciﬁc needs. You have the following customizing options:
•
Order of display and layout of the query view
•
Selection of the table display
•
Number and order of columns and number of lines in the table display
•
Column order and selection in the table display
•
Sorting, calculating and ﬁltering in the table display
With the authorization proﬁle, you have the opportunity to limit the access of
certain users or user groups to business objects or those with certain semantic
content. Using the respective settings, for instance, you can conﬁgure the following
authorizations:
•
A booking agent in a call center in Hamburg only has full access to sea freight
orders dispatched from Germany. He only has reading access to other orders if
they are processed via Germany.
•
An import employee in a Singapore ofﬁce only has access to freight orders that
arrive in Singapore via air freight and on- and preliminary carriages within
Singapore by truck.
2.6.3
Business Objects and Functions Illustrated in a Sample
Process
We would like to highlight the business objects and detail functions of SAP TM
with the aid of a sample process. This process, divided among several employees,
involves full container processing for sea freight (Full Container Load, FCL),
representing a standard process of a logistics service provider. A simpliﬁed process
ﬂow diagram can be seen in Fig. 2.38.
The simpliﬁcation lies in the summary of process steps and the fact that all
participating service providers and planners are displayed in a generic process
track.
The process indicated includes the following roles:
•
Shipper
Issues the shipment order FOB port of departure (Free on Board, meaning that
the shipper pays the pre-carriage and terminal fees up to and including loading
onto the ship).
•
Ship-to party
Receives the shipment and pays the main carriage and on-carriage.
•
Transport booking agent (booking agent)
Receives the order and creates and processes the shipment requests.
•

Several transportation planners can plan the import and export sections of a
shipment, and tender it to and commission carriers.
•
Service providers
Create offers for tendered partial shipments and execute partial shipments based
on subcontracts.
From a logistics view, the sample process has the following background:
A chemistry company in Japan (shipper) commissions the shipment of a 20-ft
standard full container with barrels of two types of elastomers from a production
plant in Waki, Japan, to a ﬁnishing plant in Zhongshan, China. The transport
request is subject to the Incoterm FOB Iwakuni, Japan, and is processed via the
ports of Iwakuni, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The logistics service provider Sakura
Inc. accepts the order and processes it completely for the shipper. Figure 2.39 shows
the order environment.
Before the process for an individual sea freight order begins, the following
preparatory steps are taken:
1. Master data maintenance
The transportation network administrator tends to the transportation network and
itineraries.
2. Execute subcontracting
The sea freight planner books capacity on sea vessels in advance that will be ﬁlled
with capacity requirements from transport requests in the course of planning.

Transport Logistics

The main steps in transportation processing are listed below (see the total object
model Fig. 2.36):
1. Order management – Shipper
The shipper commissions transportation via telephone and would also like to
receive a transportation proposal and pricing information.
2. Order management – Transport booking agent
The transport booking agent enters the order in the system (business object
shipment request). Then he activates the shipment request, creates three route
recommendations using the transportation proposal function, clariﬁes the
desired transportation process with the shipper, and calculates the freight prices
for shipper and recipient. This activation triggers the system to automatically
generate transport demands (freight units).
3. Transportation planning – Main carriage
The planners are automatically informed of the new freight units via their
Personal Object Worklists. First, the sea freight planner books a container on
the ship requested by the customer, consuming a portion of the previously
reserved capacity (business object booking order) in the process. At the appro-
priate time, the sea freight planner generates a subcontract for the sea vessel
(business object shipment request), which serves as the master B/L. Here, of
course, consolidation with other shipments may also take place, but this is not
the case for our sample process.
4. Transportation planning – Pre-carriage/on-carriage
After the sea freight booking, the import and export planners can independently
plan the pre- and on-carriage shipments in their work list and generate subcontracts
for them (these are also business objects of the type shipment request).
5. Freight cost management and settlement
The transport booking agent can already create and send the invoice to the
shipper (FOB prepaid, from the pick-up location to on board the ship). For this,
he generates a pro-forma invoice (business object customer freight invoice
request) and forwards it to SAP ERP FI/CO.
6. Subcontracting and tendering – Pre-carriage
The pre-carriage planner can use the service provider selection and tendering
functions to submit inquiries to several service providers regarding price
quotations and pre-carriage processing.
7. Quotation – Pre-carriage
The contacted service providers can submit quotations for the processing of the
pre-carriage transport via the collaboration portal.
8. Service provider selection – Pre-carriage
After the tendering period has expired, the pre-carriage planner can select a
service provider and grant the transport job by forwarding the pre-carriage
shipment request.
9. Subcontracting and tendering – On-carriage
Like the pre-carriage procedure, the import planner can commission on-
carriage with the aid of the on-carriage shipment request.
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM
73

10. Generation of a house bill of lading
Before the process is executed, the export planner creates the shipment, and can
generate the house bill of lading from it as well as initiate shipment tracking.
11. Freight cost management and invoicing the recipient
At any time after cost calculation in the shipment request, the invoice for the
recipient can also be initiated. Here, too, a customer freight invoice request is
generated and sent to SAP ERP FI/CO.
12. Freight cost management and payment of service provider invoice
The supplier freight invoice request is generated from the shipment orders for
pre-carriage, main carriage and on-carriage and also forwarded to SAP ERP
Materials Management. This makes them available for veriﬁcation of incoming
carrier invoices.
13. Proﬁtability calculation
After receipt of the supplier invoices and, if applicable, adjustment of invoice
amounts, the shipment request can be subjected to a proﬁtability check. There-
after, the shipment request is marked as completed.
2.6.4
Order Management
Order Management provides functions necessary for the acceptance of a shipment
order. A variety of business objects are available for this. Table 2.3 provides an
overview of the application areas of order business objects.
Table 2.3 Order business objects in SAP TM

The shipment request is the central order business object with which all major
veriﬁcation and processing steps in order management are performed. A shipment
request can be created as a shipment order in SAP TM either through electronic
transmission (EDI) or manual entry.
Manual creation can occur in the system in several ways:
•
A shipment request is newly created and generated in SAP TM with the order
data provided by the ordering party.
•
An order is created from which a shipment request is generated through copying
and, if necessary, editing.
•
For frequently recurring, similar order processes, a template can be created for a
shipment request. It includes the recurring data (such as shipper, ship-to party,
goods description and transportation conditions). Through copying and editing,
a new shipment request is created from the template.
•
An existing shipment request can be used as a master for a new shipment request.
Figure 2.40 diagrams the possible ways of generating a shipment request.
Role and type codes in SAP Transportation Management. In SAP TM,
data ﬁeldswith role codes and type codes are usedin manybusiness objectnodes,
in order to map categories and characteristics of data. This enables you to deﬁne
as many characteristics of certain data ﬁelds as you like. In contrast to explicit

for business partners like Shipper and Ship-to Party), in role code-based deﬁni-
tion, there is a table with the columns Role and Business Partner. This lets you
enter information for the roles Shipper and Ship-to Party and the respective
business partners in addition to as many other user-deﬁned business partners as
youwish (such as PackingService Provider, Customs Agent). You are not able to
indicate these in the explicit deﬁnition, since the respective ﬁelds are missing.
In our sample process, the shipper grants the transportation order via telephone.
The employee processing the transportation order accepts the order and adds a new
shipment request using the Create function taken from his personal work list for
shipment requests.
In the shipment request template, the shipper enters the shipment request type “
Full container sea freight house-to-house”. Inferable information, such as the sales
organization, can be automatically set as a personal default value of the transporta-
tion order processor (user settings for the corresponding data ﬁelds).

Now we will look at the individual data areas for shipment requests that are ﬁlled
out by a transportation order processor. The most important data areas are:
•
Shipment request header data and transportation data

freight, air freight and general truck cargo) and allocation to organizational units
(like a sales organization or sales ofﬁce). The header data also includes status
information regarding the shipment request that applies to the entire order. The
transportation data includes Incoterms, load composition, service deﬁnitions and
total dimensions and values.
•
Business partners
Business partner data includes the obligatory information about the shipper,
ship-to party and ordering party, as well as other parties involved in the shipping
processes. They may include a predeﬁned service provider (for instance, one a
customer has requested), agent or bill-to party. Using the role concept, you can
assign as many business partners as you wish.
•
Item data
Used to deﬁne details of the goods to be shipped. Here, you can indicate the type of
goods, goods description, Material numbers, selection numbers, etc. In further
subnodes, you can enter the departure and arrival location and dates for each item.
You can also enter any necessary measurements (weights, volumes, count, dimen-
sion), values, and information regarding dangerous goods, customs and packaging.
All ﬁelds, with the exception of the goods description and amount ﬁelds, are optional.
•
Packaging
In the packaging node, you can enter information on the individual packages
necessary for the shipment order. A package is deﬁned as shipping material
(such as a pallet, cardboard box or pallet cage) with reference to the shipping
items or parts thereof. A shipping item with 20 household appliances can, for
instance, be packed on ﬁve pallets.
•
Resources
Resources are subdivided into transportation unit and vehicle resources. You can
either use these business object nodes to deﬁne resources provided by the
customer (such as an ordering party who picks up goods that have already
been packed in a container), or you can indicate special resource requirements
of the ordering party.
•
Shipment stages
In the shipment stages, the individual partial shipment segments are deﬁned. The
stages can be multimodal, and can be used for the calculation of distance and
mode-dependent transportation costs.
•
Memos
Within a shipment request, any number of language-dependent memos can be
entered. Notes are categorized free texts (such as of the category Shipping
Memo) that can be used to forward information in the process chain as well as
for printout and communication purposes.
•
Dossier
The dossier offers the opportunity to create document references and infor-
mation on necessary documents and data attachments (such as scanned
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM
77

documents related to the shipment request) and make them available to people to
edit them.
•
Costs and payment methods
These subnodes enable the recording of costs and invoice information for
shipment requests. Here, the calculated costs are saved for which the shipper
or ship-to party will later be invoiced. In addition, information regarding the
feasibility of the cost calculation is stored here, and can be accessed to analyze
the calculated prices.
•
Ofﬁcial requirements
These can be stored under the nodes for ofﬁcial requirements that are relevant for
performance of export and dangerous goods checks.
When the transportation order processor enters the shipper and ship-to parties,
the ordering party data and the departure and destination location are automatically
ﬁlled in. Afterward, the processing employee can enter the desired departure and
delivery dates. He enters the Incoterms (FOB Iwakuni) into the transportation data,
as well as the load characteristics (chemicals, ﬂammable), priority, shipping type
code and service requirement code. The total amounts and values are automatically
calculated.
The materials loaded into the full container are entered in the shipment request
items. There are 25 and 30 barrels with various elastomers. In addition to the gross
weight and volume, the gross and net weights and volumes of each shipping unit are
recorded. The total value of each item is also entered, as is the value per shipping
unit. This data is used later to generate a packing list and pro-forma invoice for
customs. Figure 2.42 shows an overview of the amounts and values of a shipment
request item.
The container is entered in the shipment request as a transportation unit resource.
The individual container numbers are entered in the Registration Number ﬁeld.
Depending on the category of transportation unit resource, a corresponding check
of the registration number takes place. The previously entered items can then be
allocated to containers to enable labeling of packages.
When a shipment request is created electronically (such as via EDI) or manually,
it is initially inactive. This state is part of its life cycle and characterizes the initial
shipment order of a customer – the customer’s wish, so to speak. Through its
activation, which can be done by an administrative employee or through program
control, a working copy of the shipment order is generated that a planner can use for
further processing. This ensures that the customer’s wish is preserved in the system
in its original form and can be referenced as needed. The various life cycle statuses
of the shipment request include In Planning, Planned, Conﬁrmed, Ready for
Execution, In Execution, Executed, Completed and Canceled.
Following activation, the booking processor can have the system issue a trans-
portation proposal (see Fig. 2.43).
Depending on the conﬁguration, SAP TM generates one or more recommendations
on how the ordered shipment can be transported, taking into account dates, shipment
characteristics, available transportation capacities and routes, and transportation costs.

Transportation proposal for an FCL sea freight shipment. Figure 2.43
shows a transportation proposal for our sample shipment from Japan to
China. Three possibilities with varying costs were determined. The most
economical is displayed in detail with the individual stages. The desired
recommendation can be selected from the presented transportation proposals
and stored in the transportation stages of the shipment request.
When the transportation proposal function is accessed, SAP TM automatically
generates freight units according to deﬁned rules. A freight unit is a shipping
volume set by a shipper that is moved collectively through the transportation
chain and forms the basis for further transportation planning and optimization.
The rules used to create the freight unit deﬁne amount restrictions and the granu-
larity of the constructed freight units, such as:

•
Freight unit per container, pallet or other packaging
•
Freight unit per shipment or shipment item
•
Freight unit per 100 kg of an item
•
Freight unit per 1 cubic meter of a shipment order
Figure 2.44 shows the principle of freight unit generation using a shipment
request with two items.
Important attributes of the freight unit include the shipper, ship-to party, items
and their amounts and material characteristics, and transportation restrictions that
can be used to regulate the transit route of a freight unit. Transportation restrictions
provide load transfer points and periods for a freight unit that will subsequently be
taken into account by Transportation Planning. In addition to the shipment stages of
the shipment request, the transportation proposal function also generates transpor-
tation restrictions for a particular freight unit.
In our example, the freight unit is constructed on the basis of containers,
meaning that the shipment request leads to a freight unit corresponding to a 20-ft
container with its contents. Based on the transportation proposal, the ports of
Fig. 2.43 Transportation proposal with route details
80

Transport Logistics

Iwakuni in Japan and Shanghai in China are set as load transfer points. This
instructs Transportation Planning to avoid routing the freight through Hong
Kong, for instance.
At a later time, the planner can, if necessary, create a shipment from the freight
units of a shipper through allocation or consolidation that can serve as a basis for the
generation of the bill of lading (see Fig. 2.44).
Based on the data in the shipment request (header, items, stages, resources), a
booking employee can execute a freight sales price calculation in the shipment
request, in order to conﬁrm the freight price for the customer. Determination of
freight costs is done using the SAP TM component Transportation Charge Man-
agement, which is accessed from the shipment request (see also the overview of the
TM object model in Fig. 2.36). In Transportation Charge Management, the list of
freight price components is generated with the aid of existing freight contracts,
tariffs, price calculation schemes and installment structures, and the individual
prices are calculated. The result is then stored in the freight cost details of the
shipment request. In Fig. 2.45, you can see an overview of the price components
that are billed to the ship-to party in our sample process.
To print documents (see the example in Fig. 2.46) in SAP TM, the Post
Processing Framework (PPF) is used, which represents a further development of
the SAP ERP printout control. In the PPF, you can deﬁne ﬂexible printing times and
requirements, print routes, used forms and their contents for SAP TM standard
documents as well as your own documents. Document deﬁnition itself is based on
Adobe Interactive Forms, with which you can create and edit documents in a
graphical editor.

are ﬁlled in. A variety of standard document types are available in SAP TM,
such as bills of lading based on various norms, shipment request
conﬁrmations or transportation instructions.
2.6.5
Transportation Planning and Optimization
Transportation planning and optimization operate on several levels, with the initial
transport demand being more concretely transformed into transport requests with
each level. Figure 2.47 provides an overview of the planning levels.
1. Shipment requests represent the initial transport demand as deﬁned in the request
overview, which generally only indicates departure and destination locations
(A, B, C, D).
2. After the transportation proposal, a detailed itinerary is determined as a binding
requirement for the transportation restrictions of the generated freight units. For
cost calculation purposes, respective shipment stages are generated in the ship-
ment request. Additional load transfer points (N, R) are added, which will be
taken into account in subsequent optimization.
3. Transportation planning and optimization considers the individual transport
demands in the stages (A-N, B-N, N-R, R-D and R-C) and, under consideration
of available capacity, schedules, freight costs, transshipment times, service
providers and incompatibilities (such as refrigerated goods in a nonrefrigerated
container), generates a cost-optimized solution. The planning run results in tours
Fig. 2.45 Freight cost calculation (here for the ship-to party with the Incoterm FOB)
82

Transport Logistics

with allocated means of transport and service providers with whom the freight
units are moved between the load transfer points.
4. Generation of the shipment order creates shipment orders for each tour and their
freight units that can be forwarded to the service provider. In the example
presented in Fig. 2.47, three shipment orders were generated:
– Pickup of goods from A and B with a collective truck tour and delivery to
Port N
– Shipping of the goods in a collective sea transport from N to R (master B/L)
– Collective truck transport from destination port R to goods recipients C and D
In the FCL business process example, the following planning steps are
performed:
1. The shipment booking employee has already issued a transportation proposal
upon entering the shipment request. This generates shipment stages in the
shipment request as well as transportation restrictions in the freight unit. In our
example, they are the segments A-N (Waki to Iwakuni port), B-N (Hiroshima to
Iwakuni port), N-R (Iwakuni port to Shanghai port), R-D (Shanghai port to
Zhongshan) and R-C (Shanghai port to Shanghai).
2. The individually generated freight unit transportation restrictions now automat-
ically appear in the Personal Object Worklist of the import/export planner.

3. Initially, the sea freight export employee in Japan plans the two transportation
restrictions of the freight units intended for sea transport based on booking
orders or itinerary-based resources, thus determining the sea route of the freight.
4.
Subsequently, the land freight export planner in Japan can plan the road
transport from the shippers to the port in Iwakuni. Depending on the resource
situation, costs and time restrictions, load consolidation may take place (as
shown in Fig. 2.47, both freights are picked up sequentially by the same vehicle
on a single tour and brought to the port), or separate tours are planned. Once the
truck tour is complete, the planner can create the shipment order.
5. When the deadline for accepting sea shipments has arrived, the sea freight
planner can create and release the shipment order for the sea freight service
provider.
6. As soon as it is decided, based on the deadline, which freight units are to be
transported on the ship and unloaded in Shanghai, the import planner in the
Chinese organization of the logistics service provider can perform planning for
transportation restrictions in China. As in the export portion, here, too,
circumstances may require consolidated road transport. The planned tours are
then used as the basis for generating shipment orders for the on-carriages.
User entry in the Transportation Planning realm is done by selecting two proﬁles

•
Requirement proﬁle
The requirement proﬁle deﬁnes which freight units are to be selected for
planning. For this, you can set geographic criteria (departure and destination
locations or zones), temporal criteria (such as delivery within the next 3 days)
and other conditions (such as only refrigerated goods). The selected freight units
are then integrated in the planner’s Personal Object Worklist.
•
Planning proﬁle
The planning proﬁle controls the functions of planning and optimization. In the
planning proﬁle, you can conﬁgure elements in several subareas such as cost
evaluation, use of queue and loading time deﬁnitions, quality of the optimization
results and individual planning steps (optimization, tour generation, shipment
order generation or service provider determination).
By selecting those two proﬁles, a user can determine his work area when
entering the planning realm. Examples for work areas pertaining to our sample
process displayed in Fig. 2.38 include:
•
Sea freight planning
Planning of sea freight shipments from Japanese to Chinese ports for the coming
2 weeks, including tour generation but without creating a shipment order.
•
Land freight planning for Japan
Planning and pick-up of FCL freight in the area of western Japan with the
destination of western Japanese sea ports within the coming 3 days, including
the generation of tours and creation of shipment orders.
•
Completion of sea freight planning
Shipment order creation and release for the planned sea freight tours from Japan
to China.
•
Land freight planning for China
Planning of a delivery of FCL freight from the Shanghai port with the destination
of the Shanghai metropolitan area within the next 3 days, including the tour
generation and shipment order creation.
After selecting the proﬁles, an interactive planning screen opens. On this screen,
the user can select the freight units to be planned and the resources to be used. Then
he can either start manual planning or an optimization run with the selected units.
Of course, it is also possible to include all selected freight units and resources in a
common planning run.
You can also make use of screens with a tour overview, graphic map display of
the transport course or a resource overview. As a result of the planning, the
individual transportation activities (loading, transport, unloading, trailer coupling
and uncoupling) are stored in SAP TM. If tours have already been created, they are
stored as a summary of several activities.
SAP TM Transportation Planning enables you to plan multimodal scenarios, that
is, you can also plan the transport in our sample process in a planning run that
determines and schedules land as well as sea freight stages together. Figure 2.48
shows a sample network.
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM

Transportation planning and the optimizer used in SAP TM allow you to employ
multifaceted planning parameters and optimization strategies and goals. Below, we
cite the most important elements that can inﬂuence the optimization result:
•
Multidimensional load capacity and time-dependent capacity consumption
for resources and booking orders
Resources (vehicles, trailers) and booking orders have a certain capacity that can
be deﬁned via several dimensions (such as a trailer with a 25-t payload, 100 m
shipping volume, 24 pallet storage spaces and 16 loading meters). In the course
of time, freight units are loaded and unloaded, such that a consumption proﬁle
results for every capacity dimension that serves as the basis for any further
loading. If the trailer mentioned above has already been loaded with 25 t but only
50 cubic meters in volume, no further loading can take place.
•
Fixed costs per vehicle
Fixed costs can be allocated to every vehicle for optimization purposes.
•
Use of freight cost-relevant elements
Cost-relevant elements, such as the distance of a transportation route, number of
loading devices, loading weight and volume, transportation duration-dependent
costs or costs incurred through intermediate stops can be taken into consider-
ation during optimization. For that process, either optimization results with real
freight costs can be calculated and compared, or imaginary optimization costs
can be used.
•
Restrictions for transportation duration, number of intermediate stops or
total distance
You can conﬁgure certain settings to limit such things as the maximum trans-
portation duration. This is advisable if a pick-up vehicle can only travel for a
maximum of 8 h. Optimization can prevent a 10-h tour from being scheduled.
•
Load compartments
For vehicles and trailers, you can deﬁne ﬁxed or variable load compartments that
can then be planned independently of one another (for instance, a tractor-trailer

with dry and refrigerated compartments). Through an incompatibility deﬁnition,
the system can be forced to only plan compatible loads for the respective
compartments (milk in the refrigerated compartment, rolled oats in the dry
compartment).
•
Decreasing capacities in variable load compartments
If load compartments are used for individual separation of the freight of individ-
ual shippers or recipients, an increasing number of compartments can lead to a
decrease in the total capacity of a vehicle in the case of incomplete capacity
utilization. This factor is taken into account through modeling of decreasing
capacities.
•
Availability and capacity utilization of handling resources in load transfer
points
If shipments are carried out via load transfer points, the number of available
handling resources at these points are decisive for loading lead time at the load
transfer point. For example, if a distribution center only has one forklift, wait
times will inevitably occur if three trucks need to be unloaded at once. This is
considered in optimization planning.
•
Opening hours
Different opening hours can be deﬁned for each location and are considered
during planning. Freight can only be picked up or dropped off during the opening
hours.
•
Duration of loading and unloading
Depending on products and locations, variable loading and unloading durations
can be modeled. Palleted goods can be unloaded much faster than goods only in
cardboard boxes, meaning a product-dependent variance occurs for the
durations. This is taken into account during planning.
•
Incompatibilities
Incompatibilities represent a means of preventing optimization solutions from
having a certain combination of planning element attributes or characteristics.
Planning elements that are taken into account include locations, resources,
products, business partners, means of transport, service providers or load
compartments. Examples of using incompatibilities include:
– Customer A does not want to be supplied by Carrier X.
– Shipper B has a ramp that can only be accessed by trucks with a maximum of
12 t.
– Milk is not to be transported in unrefrigerated compartments.
– Certain chemicals may not be transported together.
– Concrete is not to be ﬁlled into tanker trucks.
– Alcohol is not to be transported through Saudi Arabia.
•
Minimum and maximum stopover durations at load transfer points
The attributes deﬁned at the locations regarding the minimum and maximum
waiting times are used by the optimizer to generate a realistic time lapse when
scheduling transports.
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM
87

•
Depot locations
You can deﬁne depot locations for vehicles, that is, a location to which a vehicle
can return after successful delivery or pick-up. The trip to the depot location is
automatically included in the tour by Planning. Vehicles without a depot loca-
tion can begin a new tour directly from their last loading/unloading point.
•
Waiting and stopover durations (location- and product-speciﬁc)
In addition to the waiting times deﬁned at the locations, special waiting and
stopover durations can be set, and these can be added for a speciﬁc product. For
example, you can schedule a regular loading time of one hour, but add an
additional hour for products that are especially difﬁcult to load.
•
Itineraries
Itinerary-based resources (such as liner ships, airplanes, trains, transit system
networks) can be supplied with itineraries having regular or irregular departures.
The departure times are taken into account during planning.
•
Tractors and trailers, possible combinations
Vehicles can be deﬁned as active resources (with loading capacity, such as a
truck, or without loading capacity, such as a tractor) or as passive resources
(trailers). You can establish predeﬁned combinations of active and passive
resources that you can use to model tractor-trailer or railway car combinations.
These vehicle combinations are taken into account for the optimization process.
It is also possible to unhitch trailers during a tour (leaving them at a depot) and
take new trailers.
•
Penalties for early or late delivery or non-delivery
Optimization not only takes into account costs related to freight, legs, vehicle
and time, but also anticipated penalties that occur due to early or late pick-up or
delivery, or because of a failure to deliver.
When several optimization runs are preformed sequentially, a particular evalua-
tion of transportation costs and penalties may lead to planned freight units being
removed from the transportation plans. Penalty costs can depend on the signiﬁcance
of a customer and the priority of his transportation contract. Non-delivery may
occur if, for instance, individual freight units are removed from planning based on
insufﬁcient vehicle capacity or other, more highly prioritized, freight units. An
example for such a decision can be seen in Fig. 2.49, which assumes loading a ship
with 10 container loading spots.
The loading process depicted in Fig. 2.49 results in the freight unit types with
various priorities listed in Table 2.4:
On the ﬁrst booking day, the capacity situation is not yet serious; all of the freight
units resulting from orders can be transported as requested.
On the second booking day, overbooking occurs, which is accommodated for by
removing two of the freight units having a lower priority from the plan (the ﬁrm’s
own containers that are to be repositioned).
On the third booking day, extreme overbooking takes place, which leads to
customer freight units not being able to be transported. Units with a lower priority
88
2
Transport Logistics

are taken out of the plan and shipped with subsequent transports. The decision of
which freight units not to transport is made on the basis of which ones would
produce the lowest penalties.
2.6.6
Booking Freight Space
A freight space booking is a reservation of freight space on a ship, airplane, train or
truck for which it may not yet be clear what is to be transported at the time of the
booking. For instance, in sea transit, connections from Asia to Europe or to the
United States are often used to capacity, because many goods are produced in Asia
but consumed in the rest of the world. That is why there is a very unbalanced ﬂow of
goods from West to East compared with that moving East to West, a phenomenon
which also affects freight prices.
In order to secure transportation of the goods with regard to available capacity,
you can use a booking order to book freight space in advance and receive a booking
conﬁrmation. As is the case with a shipment request, you can enter the following
data in a booking order:
•
Departure und destination location: generally a departure and destination harbor,
airport or railway station
Repositioning empty containers: penalty = $500
Customer order with priority 1:   penalty = $2000
Customer order with priority 2:   penalty = $1000

Booking order for a container ship in the FCL process. Figure 2.50 shows
a booking order for sea freight transport in our sample process. Here, freight
space for ﬁve 20-ft containers is reserved. Thus, the booking order also has a
consolidating function.
Conﬁrmation of a booking order can either be done by the service provider
electronically or by one of your employees. After the booking order has been
conﬁrmed, the conﬁrmed capacity is available for transportation planning, as is
the case for the itinerary resource. You can then assign freight units as transport
demand to the booking order as transportation capacity. All of the transportation
activities allocated to a booking order are used to create a tour. A shipment order
can then be created from that tour. In accounting terms, the shipment order
represents the master bill of lading (Master B/L, MAWB).

2.6.7
Subcontracting
The subprocess Subcontracting and Tendering enables you to create, manage and
settle transport requests to third parties, such as carriers, other logistics service
providers or one’s own ﬂeet. The central business object in this area is the shipment
order (see Fig. 2.36). You can also use a freight order to consolidate several
shipment orders for a single service provider.
Shipment orders are generally the result of manual or optimized transportation
planning after the created tours have been processed by shipment order generation.
The same is true for freight orders, either generated as a result of consolidation or
from a connected transportation planning effort (Continuous Move), for which a
series of tours is allocated to a service provider to achieve higher cost efﬁciency.
You can also manually create shipment orders to request a shipment that has
either nothing or only little to do with actual transportation planning. Such orders
can include the following cases:
•
Provisioning or pick-up for empty containers
•
Work orders to service companies, such as for packing, aeration, measuring,
declaring or loading freight
Shipment orders are connected to the original shipment request via the transpor-
tation activities and freight units referenced therein. This enables SAP TM to relate
the sales side (shipment requests) with the purchasing side (shipment orders) and
perform a proﬁtability calculation for transportation orders (see Fig. 2.36).
In terms of their content, shipment orders and shipment requests are very similar,
since they represent an outgoing transportation order (that is, an order to a trans-
portation service provider) and an incoming transportation order (meaning a trans-
portation order from a shipper). Thus, you can naturally enter the same data in a
shipment order as in a shipment request. The structure of the messages used for
electronic communication is also the same. It corresponds to the EDIFACT format
IFTMIN. Figure 2.51 illustrates order development in SAP TM and the subsequent
communication with service provider systems (here, including SAP TM).
Based on the original shipment requests (on the left of the illustration), freight
units are formed that, with the aid of Transportation Planning, are allocated to tours
and shipment orders. Several shipment orders can be assigned to a freight unit (for
example, a pre-carriage, main carriage and on-carriage) that are then communicated
electronically to various service providers. If these service providers also use SAP
TM, the incoming messages are converted to shipment requests that each service
provider can individually plan.
The shipment order user interface is designed in the same way as that of the
shipment request, with the exception that there is no basic view (see Fig. 2.41),
since manual entry is only done in exceptional cases. Figure 2.52 shows the detail
view of a pre-carriage shipment order.
Unlike the shipment request, in which the shipper and recipient of goods are
entered as locations, the shipment order cites the freight station of the logistics
2.6
Transportation Management with SAP TM
91

service provider at the port of dispatch as a destination location. The cost view in
the shipment order shows the billing items that are invoiced by the transportation
service provider. Because the shipment order can be a consolidation of several
freight units – including from different shippers – it is also the business object that
represents the master bill of lading in SAP TM.
The transportation service provider selection is a function that is executed based
on shipment orders. You can manually allocate a shipment order to one or more
possible transportation service providers, or this can be done with the support of the
SAP  TM
Transport.

system. Automatic transportation provider selection is a good idea in the following
instances:
•
When several transportation service providers are possible for certain shipments,
and the one that is most inexpensive, reliable or has the highest priority is to be
selected.
•
When certain service providers serve particular regions or only execute certain
types of transports (for instance, some will not transport dangerous goods or only
ship within New England), and the allocation of a suitable service provider is to
be done automatically.
•
Outline agreements are stipulated with various service providers regarding
percentage-based or absolute quotas in a transport job that must be fulﬁlled to
receive special shipping conditions and prices (such as a minimum of 500 TEUs
on the Hamburg-to-Singapore container line or 20% of all truck transports in
New England).
As described above, you can allocate a shipment order to one or more service
providers. The shipment order is always only given to one service provider.
However, the indication of several service providers is required for the transporta-
tion tendering function. Tendering serves to select service providers from the list
who:
•
Ensure/conﬁrm available transportation capacity and performance
•
Offer the lowest price (spot quote)
SAP TM offers three procedures for the execution of the transportation tender-
ing. The tendering procedures are each controlled by a process triggered in SAP
Event Management. It ends the current process step when a service provider has
responded or the tendering period has expired, and begins the next tendering step or
presents the tendering result:
•
Peer-to-peer tendering
Tendering is performed sequentially and for each individual service provider, in
order of priority. This means that the service provider with the highest priority is
contacted. If he answers with an acceptance of the tender and the price, tendering
is complete. If he does not respond, rejects the bid or offers insufﬁcient
conditions, tendering goes to the next service provider.
•
Broadcast tendering
Tendering is sent simultaneously to all service providers. Upon expiration of the
tendering period, the offers are compared and the best one selected.
•
Open tendering
Open tendering works in much the same way as broadcast tendering; however,
not only preselected transportation service providers are contacted that have
already been allocated to a shipment order, but all service providers maintained
in the system that correspond to certain selection criteria (such as truck trans-
portation in New England).
2.6

Tendering can either be performed via electronic data communication, meaning
the service provider receives a request to submit a quote via EDI, or you can give
service providers access to a collaboration portal, where they can view tenders
directed at them and respond to them.
After the tendering process has been completed, the selected service provider is
commissioned via electronic data communication, fax or email.
After the service provider has been selected, you can calculate the freight
purchase price in the shipment order just as was done in the shipment request.
After the calculation, in the corresponding views of the shipment request, you will
ﬁnd a detailed list of the individual cost items (see Fig. 2.45). They can be manually
adjusted and subsequently used in the invoice veriﬁcation process for the service
provider and in the credit memo procedure to settle open invoices.
2.6.8
Transportation Charge Management
Transportation Charge Management is a powerful tool in SAP TM with which you
can calculate all costs occurring in transportation processes:
•
Earnings from the sale of transportation services
•
Costs for the purchase of transportation services
•
Internal costs for use of a company’s ﬂeet
•
Internal settlement between organizational units of a logistics service provider
The realm of Transportation Charge Management is primarily composed of the
following elements:
1. Contract, tariff and freight rate data (master data)
2. Operative cost structures in the order documents
3. Settlement-related cost structures in the settlement documents
4. Incoming and outgoing invoices and internal clearing
5. Booking in Cost Accounting and Financial Accounting
As depicted in Fig. 2.36, you will ﬁnd elements 1, 2 and 3 in SAP TM, and
elements 4 and 5 in SAP ERP.
The master data of Transportation Charge Management is constructed in a
multilevel way, with the elements of the central and lower levels being reusable
(see Fig. 2.53).
The top level of the deﬁnition is represented by freight agreements, which
stipulate a contractual relationship between parties with the goal of determining
transportation prices for freight purchasing or sales. In addition to the contractual
partners and application (purchasing or sales), other details such as validity periods,
currency deﬁnitions and cost limits can also be deﬁned.
Every freight agreement contains one or more tariffs that can be used within the
context of the freight agreement. A tariff deﬁnes the way in which transportation
charges are to be calculated for certain transportation processes. The tariff is also
94
2
Transport Logistics

deﬁned by determining conditions for its application; in the example shown in
Fig. 2.54, these include the shipment type sea freight and the departure and
destination ports of Hong Kong and Los Angeles. Further conditions can include
stipulations for types of goods, transportation zones or service conditions.

A transportation charge calculation is maintained in every tariff, which deﬁnes
individual cost elements and their relationships. A transportation charge calculation
can be a list of individual cost elements (such as the ocean base freight, bunker
surcharge, or terminal fees), deﬁned either with absolute values, as percentages
with reference to other cost elements or with reference to a calculation rule (such as
a rate table). Every cost element can, in turn, have conditions for its application. For
instance, you can deﬁne cost elements that can only be applied to certain Incoterms.
To calculate cost elements, rate tables are frequently consulted, which are based
on scales representing various dimensions. A rate table can have up to nine
dimensions, for which the scales are either deﬁned as direct values or as minimum
and maximum values. A typical rate table in sea freight might have the following
dimensions:
•
Departure port (Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp)
•
Destination port (Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai)
•
Container type (20-ft standard, 40-ft standard, 40-ft refrigerated container)
•
Type of goods (general freight/FAK, electronics, dangerous goods)
•
Service degree of the transport (standard, priority)
The price per container is then deﬁned depending on these ﬁve dimensions. That
price is multiplied by the number of corresponding units in the charge calculation.
Operative calculation of transportation charges is always either triggered by the
shipment request (calculation of the sales price) or the shipment order (calculation
of the purchase price) (see Fig. 2.36). The data of the respective order is transferred
to freight cost determination in a standardized format. Once there, the applicable
freight agreement and tariff are determined. This in effect determines the charge
calculation. After each cost element is calculated (under consideration of the
condition of applicability) the ﬁnished list is returned to the shipment request or
order, where it is displayed with the business object in the Costs and Payment
Method (see Fig. 2.54). Here, you can also overwrite amounts and other data to
adjust the subsequent invoice. The data is stored along with the order.
Costs view of a shipment request. Figure 2.54 shows the Cost view of a
shipment request with the various attributes and areas (freight agreement, tariff,
cost elements, etc.) high-lighted. The value in the column Total is converted to the
currency stipulated with the respective business partner in the freight agreement.
When it comes time to generate or verify the invoice, requests for freight
settlement are generated and represent a pro-forma invoice in SAP TM. Because
the actual invoice generation or veriﬁcation is performed in SAP ERP, only pro-
forma documents are generated in SAP TM, which are transferred to the ERP
system after their check and release.
In the case of a shipment request, a customer freight invoice request is generated
and directly transferred to SAP ERP, where it leads to an invoice document. This
96
2
Transport Logistics

document can be directly used for customer freight settlement and is automatically
integrated into Financial Accounting.
In the case of a shipment order, a service provider freight invoice request is
generated for settlement. This is initially transferred to SAP ERP to accrue reserves
for the expected service provider invoice. If a pro-forma invoice is then transferred,
a purchasing document for services is generated with a service entry sheet. Based
on this, the data is integrated into Financial Accounting and incoming invoice
veriﬁcation is subsequently conducted.
2.6.9
Integration with SAP Event Management
For purposes of process control and tracking the status of transportation procedures,
SAP TM is integrated with SAP Event Management. Relevant processes that must
be monitored by Event Management are automatically initiated:
•
Tracking of the processing status of a shipment request
•
Shipment tracking
•
Tour tracking (itinerary monitoring)
•
Tracking of a resource as an asset (containers and railway car tracking)
•
Status and life cycle management for tendered shipment requests
Status values are reported to Event Management either from the current process
in SAP TM or, more frequently, from outside via electronic data communication
(EDI) or interactive feedback (such as a vehicle computer or onboard unit, OBU).
You can then display the status history in SAP TM, in the context of the respective
business object. Figure 2.55 shows the view of the status history of a shipment from
our sample process.

Summary
In the world of SAP solutions, each transportation management component has a
special signiﬁcance. As the most modern of the components, SAP Transportation
Management (SAP TM) offers the widest range of functions and the greatest degree
of ﬂexibility.
For simple scenarios, however, and considering TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
aspects, the use of SAP ERP Transportation Management can also be beneﬁcial;
with it, you do not need any additional system for transportation management.
If you have demands in the realm of transportation optimization, you can either
integrate an external transportation planning system into ERP Transportation Man-
agement, or select APO Transportation Optimization, which also gives you the
integration of an availability check.
In the next chapter, we will examine warehouse logistics and inventory manage-
ment with SAP.

Chapter 3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory
Management
A warehouse is deﬁned as a “structural unit with all resources and organizational
provisions necessary for the execution of processes connected to inventory and
warehouse management, including the organizational units involved with goods
receipt and shipping” (Pfohl 2004, pp. 124–146). Unlike this subjective description,
the proverbial saying “The best warehouse is no warehouse” implies an evaluation:
It characterizes a warehouse and warehousing as something negative, to be avoided
wherever possible.
The latter statement holds a kernel of truth, since inventory (raw materials and
supplies, semi-ﬁnished and ﬁnished products) and warehouse buildings incur costs.
The statement is aimed at an improvement in cost-effectiveness – which, of course,
is a signiﬁcant aspect of warehousing.
In addition to improving cost-effectiveness through lowering costs, the func-
tional processing of all goods movement that causes a change in inventory is the
primary task of software designed to control warehouse logistics and maintain
inventories.
We also see the warehouse as a link between internal and external logistics.
In this chapter, we will provide a detailed overview of the functions offered by SAP
and their integration in the logistics core processes of procurement and distribution.
We will illustrate this with several examples for inbound as well as outbound
processes, and for WM (Warehouse Management) as well as SAP EWM (Extended
Warehouse Management).
3.1
The Fundamentals of Warehouse Logistics
In this section, we will look at the fundamentals of warehouse logistics and
inventory management, explain their signiﬁcance to industrial management, and
examine the systems and requirements for mapping logistics processes.

3.1.1
Management-Related Signiﬁcance
Warehouse logistics involves the storage and maintenance of goods in warehouses.
Warehouse management, or warehousing, is a realm of materials management.
From a business and management point of view, the warehouse equipment of such
a “structural unit” takes up space and ties up ﬁxed assets. In addition, warehouse
inventory ties up liquid asset capital. Nevertheless, there are several management-
related reasons for creating inventory and maintaining it accordingly (see
Table 3.1).
As a rule, a logistics chain contains several warehouses between a raw materials
source and the end customer. Thus, on each individual level of the logistics
network, stock is established to strike a balance between ﬂuctuating requirements
and inward goods movement times, or due to insecurity about future requirements
in order to secure material availability.
With the aid of stock procurement, a disconnection between materials procure-
ment and materials use in production or distribution processes is achieved.
Stockkeeping fulﬁlls the primary goal of ensuring material availability and
represents a reaction to any insecurities in the materials procurement and produc-
tion planning processes. From a production logistics point of view, stockkeeping
enables a streamlining of production by building up warehouse stock in times of
low demand and reducing it in times of increased demand.
Against the backdrop of the logistics core function of a warehouse – bridging
time – we can identify two central reasons for stockkeeping:
•
The establishment of inventory to guarantee ability to deliver
•
To offset ﬂuctuations in delivery and demand
Securing the ability to deliver is thus often achieved by maintaining a higher
stock level and, consequently, higher capital commitment. Especially with a view
to cost pressure, in addition to operative warehouse functions and the modern tasks
of warehouse logistics, it is important to reduce a signiﬁcant driver of inventory –
lead times. Among the major factors for success are modern, IT-supported ware-
house management systems.

3.1.2
Systems and Applications
Early software for warehouse logistics and inventory management appeared in
the early 1970s. In those days, people around the world referred to systems
for warehouse management in their native tongues. It was only in the course of
increased functionality and the implementation of optimization algorithms that the
English term warehouse management system found widespread usage.
Originally, warehouse systems were pure stock management systems, whose
goal it was to maintain quantities and locations within a warehouse and their
relation to one another. The quantity refers to the amount of materials stored,
while the location means the respective bin location. Additional functions can
include the maintenance of transportation systems.
In contrast, modern warehouse management systems (WMS) are capable of not
only supervising complex warehouse and distribution centers, but also controlling
and – with regard to the reduction of internal stock – optimizing them. Warehouse
management in general thus refers to the control, supervision and optimization of
complex warehouse and distribution systems. In addition to the elementary
functions of warehouse management, such as quantity and location management,
conveyance control and planning, warehouse management also includes compre-
hensive means and methods for supervising system conditions (with software
and automation technology) and a selection of business and optimization strategies.
The task of a WMS is thus the operation and optimization of internal warehouse
systems.
In the meantime, we not only expect a high-performance warehouse manage-
ment system to accomplish the operative maintenance of materials and their bin
locations, but to also provide continual optimizing control and supervision of
material ﬂow, equipment and staff, from goods receipt through all warehouse and
processing steps, right up to goods issue. In this regard, most companies need to
master the following core processes with the support of a warehouse management
system:
•
Unloading the means of transport and furnishing the materials in the goods
receipt area
•
Goods receipt monitoring
•
Deconsolidation through the dissolution of loading units and formation of
storage units
•
Provision for placement into stock
•
Putaway, storage, withdrawal
•
Picking
•
Packing, formation of loading units and loading
In business practice, especially due to its rationalization and optimization poten-
tial, the strategic signiﬁcance of the warehouse has been steadily increasing. As a
result, the processes and tasks taking place in a warehouse are also changing. In the
past, it often sufﬁced to manually post goods receipts and issues and place goods,
3.1
The Fundamentals of Warehouse Logistics
101

usually in a chaotic fashion. Today, the tasks of warehouse management are
considerably more complex and rely on the support of an intelligent IT system.
RFID technology (radio frequency identiﬁcation), automated rack systems and
operation technology, route optimization, pick-by-voice and robotics are trends
that extend far beyond traditional warehouse processes and must be supported by a
modern warehouse system.
The performance and efﬁciency of a logistics chain depend largely on the
optimal interplay of the ERP and warehouse management systems employed.
That is why warehouse management systems are often integrated or closely linked
to an existing ERP system.
In an SAP system environment, we differentiate between pure inventory man-
agement and warehouse management. Inventory management and evaluation is
generally the task of an ERP system. Within materials management, inventory
management provides information on what total quantity of a material is in stock.
It enables the precise indication of the exact location of a certain material quantity
in the warehouse, and also tells us whether this amount is idle and situated in its
location or in movement.
Inventory management and warehouse management
An SAP system differentiates between inventory and warehouse management.
– Inventory management
The primary task of inventory management is the management of stock
with regard to its quantity and value. Inventory management is executed
regardless of the warehouse management utilized in SAP ERP.
– Warehouse management
Warehouse management concerns the spatial division of a warehouse, the
assignment of warehouse bin locations and the processes within a ware-
house. Warehouse management is either executed with integration to SAP
ERP or decentrally, either on the basis of an ERP system (SAP LES) or using
SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM), an SAP SCM component.
The administration of and transparency regarding existing materials is essential
to making precise statements about the availability of a material. Goods movements
are usually caused by procurement, distribution and the associated goods receipts
and issues, or through stock transfer.
SAP has been providing warehouse management functions since the release
of SAP R/3 2.0. Thus, it can look back on more than 16 years of experience
in warehouse management and countless successful implementations. Ever since
the ﬁrst SAP R/3-based versions and leading right up to the current SAP SCM-
based systems, functionality has been continually expanded and adjusted accord-
ingly to customer demands. In addition to Warehouse Management (WM) as part of
SAP ERP, in 2005 the considerably more efﬁcient SAP Extended Warehouse
102
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Management (SAP EWM) was introduced, which is based on SAP Supply Chain
Management (SAP SCM).
Originally a part of SAP Spare Parts Management, today SAP EWM is an
independent application that can be used in any warehouse environment. SAP
EWM was developed for complex warehouse and distribution centers with several
different products and a high document volume, and in contrast to WM, it offers
many new and expanded functions. SAP EWM does not replace ERP-based ware-
house management, but supplements it with a decentralized warehouse system.
In this chapter, we will thus discuss WM (SAP ERP) as well as SAP EWM (SAP
SCM), focusing on the respective mapping and integration of logistics core pro-
cesses. Since both SAP systems partially overlap with regard to existing functions,
we will describe the corresponding processes for the system in which the last
functional expansion took place (generally SAP EWM). This especially applies to
auxiliary logistics services, such as cross-docking. Although both are also possible
in SAP ERP, EWM offers considerably more functions.
The selection of a warehouse management system and the associated system
architecture is a central issue in every project pertaining to warehouse management.
While discussion in recent years has concentrated on whether or not a central or
decentral system should be implemented and how to integrate it into an existing
warehouse automation system, the focus is now shifting.
Economic issues have not only changed due to the introduction of an EWM
system, which is vastly expanded in comparison to an ERP-based management
system. While in the past primarily technical inﬂuencing factors were examined,
such as degree of automation and system performance, it is currently economic factors
that have come under scrutiny and are decisive when selecting a product. A sweeping
answer is not available for ﬁnding solutions to these issues, yet there are certain points
of reference and relationships that can indicate a certain direction and possibly
exclude certain architectures. Degree of automation continues to be a very important
technical as well as economic inﬂuencing factor that greatly affects such a decision.
If the connection of warehouse and conveyor technology is a central issue for a
project, the new SAP EWM has considerable advantages over the old solution.
Starting from Release 5.1, EWM offers in its component Material Flow System
(MFS) a fully integrated material ﬂow calculator with which warehouse and
conveyor elements can be connected and controlled in real time. SAP EWM also
allows you to connect programmable logic controllers (PLCs) as well as to map
checkpoints, rack feeders or conveyor segments using a standard conﬁguration.
In addition to the degree of automation, there is a series of other inﬂuencing factors
for determining the system architecture, each of which must be adjusted to the
speciﬁc demands of a company.
3.1.3
Organizational Structures and Master Data
Organizational structures play a signiﬁcant role in the control of logistics processes
and the operative administration of material and its corresponding quantities.
3.1
The Fundamentals of Warehouse Logistics
103

Furthermore, technical system integration of decentral warehouse management
with SAP EWM is based on the allocation of SAP ERP and SAP SCM organiza-
tional units, that is, on whether or not the decentral system is responsible for
warehouse execution.
A central organizational element is the warehouse number. The number, based
on subordinate warehouse structures and, as the technical and organizational unit of
a warehouse management system, represents a warehouse’s complex spatial struc-
ture and circumstances. In operational practice, the warehouse number corresponds
to a warehouse complex or an individual warehouse building. It also serves as the
central element under which warehouse-speciﬁc material master data, such as
information on palleting, picking and placing, is stored.
Warehouse numbers can be assigned to a speciﬁc plant/storage location combi-
nation (see Fig. 3.1). This assignment represents a link between inventory manage-
ment and warehouse management, and enables the use of warehouse management
functions with SAP ERP or SAP EWM (see also Volume 1, Chap. 3, “Organiza-
tional Structures and Master Data”).
Organizational structures and allocation
Figure 3.1 shows the plant structure of a company with two production sites:
New York and Philadelphia. The plants are allocated to different storage
locations, which in turn are assigned a speciﬁc WM warehouse number.
The subordinate warehouse structures of the warehouse numbers Central
Warehouse 1 and Central Warehouse 2 are mapped in SAP ERP. The
warehouse Airport, which is allocated to storage locations NY-South and
PH-North, is a decentral warehouse that is used by both production sites.
The warehouse number Airport is identiﬁed as a decentral warehouse and
linked to a SAP EWM warehouse number.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

The materials stored in an EWM warehouse are maintained with reference to
quantity at the warehouse level. To achieve this, SAP EWM is seamlessly
integrated with the Inventory Management of SAP ERP. Integration is done via
the direct assignment of an ERP warehouse to an EWM warehouse number and a
system setting that speciﬁcally identiﬁes the assigned ERP number as a decentral
warehouse. The SAP EWM warehouse number has a similar function as those used
in SAP ERP. Although EWM is not functionally related to SAP ERP Warehouse
Management, the EWM warehouse number also indicates the physical location in
which material is stored and maintained. The actual structuring of the warehouse
and the allocation of warehouse numbers to warehouse structure elements depend
on the respective warehouse management system, and will be explained in the
sections below along with the system-speciﬁc warehouse processes and their
integration.
Both WM and EWM use SAP ERP Inventory Management (IM) to maintain
quantity- and value-based inventory. Thus, we will initially discuss the basics of
Inventory Management in SAP ERP before turning to the most important
differences between warehouse structuring and management with SAP ERP and
SAP EWM.
3.2
Inventory Management
Inventory Management is a part of Materials Management. As the latter’s central
area, it is seamlessly integrated with all logistics processes that trigger a change in
inventory (see Fig. 3.2). From a logistics standpoint, this integration refers to the
moved quantities, and from an accounting standpoint, to the moved values. In all
processes, Inventory Management accesses the respective master data and move-
ment data.
Material requirements determination uses Inventory Management, its physical
stock, and planned inﬂow and outﬂow for the planning and determination of
requirements. Requirements are either procured internally or externally. External
procurement is generally performed by purchasing from an external vendor. Inter-
nal procurement is achieved via in-house production or by internally procuring
materials from another plant via stock transfer.
In the case of in-house production, Inventory Management governs the provision
of components and records the receipt of ﬁnished products into stock. Finished
products are maintained and stored in stock until they are shipped to customers or
used for internal purposes.
The external procurement of material is executed in Purchasing by placing an
order with an external vendor. The integration of inventory management takes
place through goods receipt with reference to the purchase order or the delivery.
Goods receipts generally lead to an increase in stock. Inventory Management
documents the actual quantities received, making it possible to check and verify
whether the quantities and values of the order and goods receipt match the ﬁgures
on the invoice.
3.2
Inventory Management
105

Retrieving items from stock is not only done for production, but also for the
supply of sales orders. As early as the sales order processing stage, the system can
verify whether the required material will be available in a sufﬁcient quantity on the
desired delivery date. When doing so, the availability check considers the require-
ment quantities of planned inﬂow and other outﬂow for already-conﬁrmed sales
orders. When deliveries are generated, the quantity to be delivered to the customer
is updated and subtracted from the total stock when the goods issue is posted.
Goods movement leads to changes in stock. Actual goods movement is con-
trolled in an ERP system by so-called movement types. The movement type, a three-
digit code, identiﬁes goods movement and controls how it is to be executed and
what effects it will have on the system. In addition to quantity and value updates,
these effects inﬂuence messages that can be issued by the system during goods
movement as well as the type of stock that can be posted.
For inventory management, it is not only important to know what quantity of a
material is situated in a particular bin location or factory, but also what type of stock it
represents (see Fig. 3.3). The type of stock governs what stock type can be posted for
each goods movement, as well as whether it is unrestricted or is subject to a block. It
is vital to know this detail in order to be able to provide precise information about the
availability of a material. If the usability of a material changes, a posting change can
be carried out. For this type of posting change, a physical goods movement to another

storage location can be recorded. Stock types differ in terms of the application and
usability of a material, as well as whether it is special stock.
Stock quantities are indicated for the various stock types, and the availability of a
material in various departments is also mapped. For instance, the total open purchase
order quantity is available to cover requirements in Planning but cannot be freely
used in Materials Management, since no goods receipt took place (see Fig. 3.3).
Stock types in goods receipt
In business operations, goods receipts from an external vendor are not
immediately posted to unrestricted-use stock, but ﬁrst are subjected to a
quality inspection. Depending on the result of this inspection, the material
is either posted (and thus booked as unrestricted-use stock) or blocked.
Blocked stock is subsequently sent back to the vendor (see Fig. 3.3).
The following types of stock indicate material availability:
•
Consignment stock
Material that a vendor makes available in your warehouse but that does not
become the property of your company until it is issued or transferred and
invoiced.
•

•
Blocked stock
Material that is not to be issued.
•
Quality inspection stock
Material intended for use only after an inspection.
•
Goods receipt blocked stock
Material that can only be accepted on certain conditions.
These general types of stock are primarily differentiated on the basis of their
usability. In addition, the system distinguishes between valuated and non-valuated
stock. For instance, the quality inspection stock can be valuated stock that is subject
to usability limitations. A blocked stock return is blocked stock with material that
has been returned by a customer and accepted conditionally. Until a ﬁnal decision is
made, it is thus neither valuated nor available for unrestricted use. Due to its
signiﬁcance for inventory management, inventory valuation will be explained in
more detail in Sect. 3.2.2, “Inventory Valuation”.
Transfer posts between stock types
Figure 3.4 shows a transfer post in SAP ERP. Material 100-110 is transferred
from unrestricted-use stock to quality inspection stock within the same
storage location. This posting is controlled by Movement Type 322.

Stock overview after transfer posting
Figure 3.5 shows the stock overview for Material 100-110 after the transfer
posting. The unrestricted-use plant and storage location stock amounts to 568
units, composed of the following: 252 units from Plant 1000 in Hamburg and
316 units from Plant 3000 in New York. Twenty units of the material are in
quality inspection stock, which is restricted in use.
3.2.1
Goods Movement
The purpose of inventory management is to map the physical stock by recording all
activity that changes inventory. Such quantity-based inventory management is done
in real time, documented by so-called material documents, which form the basis of
updating quantities and values and serve as proof of stock movement. In keeping
with the motto “No posting without a document”, any updating of inventory
through goods movement leads to a material document.
Goods movement includes external and internal procedures. External pro-
cedures are processes of procurement and sales and distribution logistics in which
material is purchased or sold. Internal procedures are logistics processes in which
material movement occurs on the basis of internal stock transfers or production
retrievals.
Figure 3.3 depicts the integration of inventory management with core logistics
processes, its delimitations to warehouse management and major goods movement
types: goods receipt, goods issue, returns, reservations and stock transfers and
transfer postings.

3.2.1.1
Effects of Goods Movement
Goods movement represents logistics-related procedures that are recorded in
the system. They always result in a change in inventory and lead to an updating
in real time that allows an overview of the current inventory situation at any time.
In addition to the pure stock overview of plant and storage location stock, it also
includes reserved stock and any quantities that are in quality inspection or have
already been ordered but have not yet arrived.
Goods movement is documented in material documents (Fig. 3.6).
Every incidence of goods movement thus leads to a material document that
serves as evidence for that movement, as well as to update stock quantities and the
consumption statistics. Material consumption is then used by Materials Planning to
generate forecasts. In the procurement and sales and distribution logistics pro-
cesses, material documents also represent a source of information for further
processing.
In addition to simple quantity and value-related changes in inventory, goods
movement has logistics effects on the subsequent processes. Goods receipts update
purchase orders or generate an inspection lot for Quality Management, while goods
issues lead to transport demand and can dictate the printing of goods issue receipts.
Further processing of goods movement includes the accounting-related effects of
inventory change, which is documented via an accounting document.

Material document
Figure 3.6 shows a material document for Material 101-100. Goods move-
ment, in this case a goods receipt of one unit to non-restricted stock of Storage
Location 0001 in Plant 1000, was executed with Movement Type 501.
Material 101-100 is maintained in stock on a valuated basis. Thus, the system
generates an accounting document with the number 4900000096 as a follow-
on document of the material document. The accounting document is
discussed in Sect. 3.2.2, “Inventory Valuation”, and illustrated in Fig. 3.8.
Goods receipts are goods movements that lead to an increase in stock. Goods
receipts result either from an external procurement procedure, the receipt of goods
from an external supplier or from the inﬂow of ﬁnished products from Production.
We can differentiate between the following types of goods receipts:
Goods receipts for a purchase order are done via an external procurement
procedure with reference to an order placed with a vendor. The goods receipt for
this purchasing process enables veriﬁcation of whether the delivered items corre-
spond to those ordered. In addition, the reference to an order document enables a
check of the permissible over- and underdeliveries and allows an evaluation of the
goods receipt based on the order and invoice price, since the vendor invoice is also
checked and compared to the ordered and delivered quantities.
Production orders from Production are another trigger of goods receipts. Pro-
duction orders trigger production processes not within the scope of this book, but
they also serve as an important planning and monitoring instrument for Materials
Planning and Inventory Management. The produced materials can either be posted
to a certain type of stock or immediately consumed. Goods receipts from Produc-
tion generally refer to a production order thus determine the storage location where
the stock is posted when the ﬁnished product enters the warehouse. The type of
stock, that is, whether it is unrestricted, restricted or quality inspection stock,
depends on the respective system setting in the ERP system.
Inventory management allows you to post goods receipts that do not relate to a
preceding document. Such receipts include those initially entered as part of the data
being migrated from an older system. You can also create internal as well as
external goods receipts without reference to a document. Such instances include
free deliveries from a supplier not based on the submission of a purchase order,
customer returns without a return order and return deliveries.
A goods issue is generally a goods movement that reduces stock and with which
a materials withdrawal or consumption is booked. The withdrawal of materials is
usually done in connection with a shipment of goods to a customer or with material
consumption related to production processes. Thus, we can differentiate between
the following types of goods issue:
3.2
Inventory Management
111

The withdrawal, picking and shipment of ordered goods to an external customer
comprise the core logistics process of sales and distribution (SD) logistics. Goods
issue that is done with reference to a delivery represents its effect, from a materials
management standpoint, and leads to a reduction of stock. In the case of especially
urgent material requisitions for which a preceding document might not be available,
goods issue to a customer can be executed without dispatch handling.
Goods issues for Production generally take the form of withdrawals of raw
materials and supplies for production. We differentiate between planned and
unplanned withdrawals. Planned withdrawals are done with reference to a produc-
tion order that has triggered a materials reservation for the planned components.
Actual goods issue is related to the production order or the reservation produced by
such an order. Unplanned goods issues are withdrawals during the production
process in which it is determined that, for a certain production order, additional
material or a deviating quantity is required in addition to components already
withdrawn. Withdrawal is thus unplanned and without reference to a reservation,
a so-called goods issue without reference.
This type of unplanned goods issue can also be performed for other purposes,
such as for the withdrawal of samples and consumption to a cost center or
settlement for an internal order.
From the perspective of inventory management, scrapping or withdrawing a
sample is considered material withdrawal and thus a goods issue without reference.
Scrapping is done when a particular material is no longer needed or has lost quality.
Goods issues for returns are return deliveries to suppliers if the delivered goods
for some reason do not correspond to the required type or quantity. Return delivery
is done either immediately upon goods receipt, with reference to the purchase order
or after the goods receipt has been posted. The material document of the goods
receipt or purchase order related to the goods receipt serves as the reference. Actual
return delivery is picked and packed, after which a good issue is posted and the
shipping documents printed. If the supplier sends a replacement delivery upon
receipt of the return delivery, the new goods receipt can reference the return
delivery.
A reservation represents a request to the warehouse to make a certain quantity of
materials available for later withdrawal. This withdrawal is usually earmarked and
is taken into account by Materials Planning to ensure that the required material can
be procured in a timely manner. Reservations aid in the preliminary planning of
future goods movements and can be generated automatically by the system for
goods receipts and issues, or be created manually. They are used for planned and
unplanned goods issues, or to plan stock transfers. An example of an earmarked
goods issue is the reservation of a certain quantity of a speciﬁc material for a sales
order.
Reservations are used to plan future goods movement. The result of this planning
is the reservation document, which increases the reserved inventory of a material
without changing the total inventory or unrestricted-use stock. From the viewpoint
of material requirements planning, on the other hand, available stock decreases by
the reserved quantity (see Fig. 3.7).
112

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Through the speciﬁc reference to various account assignment objects (orders,
plants or cost centers), reservations simplify and accelerate goods receipts as well
as goods issues. The actual reservation is mapped in the ERP system as a reserva-
tion document, which consists of a header and item data, and contains planning-
relevant information. The header data includes information pertaining to the move-
ment type and accounting object. The item data contains detailed information on
the reservation process. It shows what material is required at what time and in what
quantity, which plant or storage location is to provide it and where the material is to
be moved on the required date.
Stock and requirements list for a material
Figure 3.7 shows the stock and requirements list for Material 101-100 in Plant
1000. The available quantity of 273 units is reduced by planned outﬂow and
increased by planned inﬂow. Materials planning elements indicate activity
such as reservations that reduce inventory and procurement orders that
increase stock quantities.
Generally, stock is not exclusively managed from a central site, but rather often
decentrally from several locations. In such cases, it may be necessary to transfer
materials in one speciﬁc location to another storage location or to alter its account-
ing stock attributes due to internal reasons.
A stock transfer refers to a two-step procedure in which material is taken from
one storage location and moved to another one. Stock transfers can occur within the
same plant as well as between two (or more, but always in pairs) plants or company
codes. Stock transfers between storage locations within one plant lead to an update
Fig. 3.7 Stock/requirements list
3.2
Inventory Management
113

of stock quantities in both storage locations – a reduction in the outﬂow storage
location and an increase in the inﬂow location. In addition to stock changes,
transfers between plants can also inﬂuence accounting if both plants belong to
different company codes.
Stock transfers can either be done in one or two steps. The one-step procedure
consists of a goods issue from the issuing storage location and a goods receipt at the
receiving location. In this process, only a single material document is generated in
the system. The two-step procedure also enables the monitoring of the transferred
stock through the initial posting of that stock into transfer stock after the goods
issue posting that stock is maintained in the system with reference to the receiving
location. In a second step, the stock is then further posted in the receiving storage
location. Another stock transfer option is offered by a stock transport order, which
can be done with or without deliveries, in a one- or two-step procedure, and either
internally or for more than one company code.
Stock transport orders can be executed with or without the generation of a
delivery. Stock transport orders with delivery are carried out exclusively with the
two-step procedure and with two separate goods movements. First, the stock
transport order is created in the receiving plant, including any necessary delivery
costs. The issuing plant then generates a so-called replenishment delivery with
reference to the stock transport order and posts the goods issue. From a manage-
ment standpoint, the goods issue posting represents a value transfer, because the
material is allocated to the receiving plant for accounting. The actual posting is
documented through the material document and the accounting document, which
is also visible in addition to the stock transport order and replenishment delivery.
In order to monitor the quantities being transferred between the two plants, the
quantity posted for transfer is ﬁrst maintained as being stock in transit for
the receiving plant. Only after the goods receipt is posted is the quantity booked
to the unrestricted-use stock of the receiving plant. The stock in transit is thus
diminished and the unrestricted-use stock increased.
Because, from an accounting perspective, the material is allocated to the receiv-
ing plant upon goods issue, only a material document and not an accounting
document is generated upon goods receipt (in the two-step procedure). Valuation
of the stock is done on the basis of the valuation price in the issuing plant. (Stock
valuation will be explained in the following section.) In the event that the two plants
belong to two different company codes, a cross-company code transfer takes place.
In such a case, the corresponding accounting documents are generated when the
goods issue is posted for internal settlement between the company codes.
Unlike a stock transport order with delivery, a stock transport order without
delivery can be done using the one- or two-step procedure. The process is similar to
the steps described above, with the difference that posting of material movements
(in either the one- or two-step procedure) is done directly with reference to a
purchasing document without a delivery having previously been generated. For
this type of transfer, the receiving plant has access to all purchasing functions and
can perform such tasks as record delivery costs for a purchase order. Goods issue
114

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

from the issuing plant is done in Inventory Management without using the SAP
ERP Sales and Distribution component SD. In the receiving plant, the quantities
posted for transfer are ﬁrst booked as stock in transit. When the goods receipt is
posted, the status of that stock is changed to unrestricted use.
Stock transfers between two plants belonging to different company codes can
be done using either the one-step or two-step procedure. Since the material can
be valuated differently in each of the company codes, the valuation price in this type
of stock transfer is not based on the issuing plant, but rather the condition values
stored in the respective company code. Here, too, stock transfer is initially executed
with a stock transport order in the receiving plant. Because a vendor is indicated
in the stock transport order to which a delivering plant (issuing plant) is allocated
in the vendor master record, the system recognizes that the order is a stock transport
order with delivery and billing documents, and performs pricing in Purchasing.
Pricing can be done based on a maintained purchase info record (see Volume 1,
Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”). If the order is due for delivery, the issuing
plant generates a replenishment delivery either with or without an availability
check, depending on the system settings. The goods issue is posted in a one- or
two-step procedure. Unlike the types of stock transport order mentioned above,
the stock in this case is not posted as being in transit. In the stock overview of the
issuing plant, the issued quantity is taken from the unrestricted-use stock and posted
to delivery stock.
From the accounting perspective, when there is a stock transport order
with delivery and billing, the stock account of the supplying company code is
updated with the valuation price of the material in the delivering plant. For internal
settlement, the replenishment delivery is invoiced in relation to the delivery.
Billing is handled in the issuing organization with pricing according to the regular
procedure, based on the condition technique. The invoice is usually automatically
forwarded to the receiving plant with a payment block. If the stock transfer is
executed using the two-step method, the receiving plant posts the goods receipt
with reference to the delivery. Accounting posts the transferred quantity to the
unrestricted-use stock, which increases that stock. From an inventory management
perspective, the transferred quantity is then allocated to the company code of the
receiving plant. Goods movement thus generates an accounting document with the
procurement price taken from the stock transport order. After the delivered quantity
is checked, a logistics invoice veriﬁcation is performed. The payment block is
removed, and the invoice is released for payment (see also Volume 1,, Chap. 4,
Sect. 4.5.3, “Invoice Veriﬁcation and Handling of Payments”).
In contrast to stock transfers, transfer postings not only indicate pure physical
changes in stock through movement, but also a change in the stock identiﬁcation
and qualiﬁcation of a material. For instance, transfer postings can be done when
consignment material is received and put into a company’s own stock or when
blocked stock is released following a quality check.

3.2.2
Inventory Valuation
Because of high capital commitment and warehouse maintenance costs, inventory
should be maintained such that everyone responsible can receive precise informa-
tion at any time regarding quantities and values. Inventory valuation serves the task
of exactly recording the capital tied up in inventory.
The materials to be valuated are not only examined with regard to quantity
(such as in units or kilograms), but also with regard to value (for instance, in the
currency of a particular country). This means that the valuation of materials
according to trade and tax laws is designed to produce veriﬁcation of the where-
abouts of materials kept in a warehouse. It can also keep track of the inﬂow and
outﬂow of materials and inventory for accounting, cost accounting, costing and
company statistics. Since materials are purchased or manufactured at various times
and their prices often change daily, materials are subject to price ﬂuctuations. The
receipt and consumption of materials often happen at separate times. Because prices
can change, it is necessary to valuate the materials at a ﬁxed point in time and
according to ofﬁcially approved valuation procedures (within trade and tax laws).
These valuation procedures for ﬁnancial valuation of inventory (lowest value deter-
mination, LIFO and FIFO procedures) will not be discussed in any detail here.
Instead, we refer to the further recommended reading listed in the appendix of this
book.
Within SAP ERP, material valuation is not an independent work area, since
several functions for the valuation of materials occur automatically, and the tasks
that are to be carried out manually are performed either in Inventory Management
or Invoice Veriﬁcation, depending on the respective organizational structure. Due
to the integrative quality of the ERP system, materials movement establishes a
connection between Materials Management (MM) and Financial Accounting (FI)
that accesses and updates the G/L accounts (see Fig. 3.8).
Fig. 3.8 Accounting document for goods movement

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Accounting document and stock value
The accounting document in Fig. 3.8 was generated as a document in
Accounting for the material document in Fig. 3.6. The subject of the material
movement was a goods receipt into unrestricted-use stock. The posting record
of this accounting document thus refers to the increase in stock of an
unﬁnished product, and posts the material value in the amount of €6.00 on
the debit side of Account 300000. The offsetting entry is posted to the credit
side of Account 400020, a stock change account without a cost element. The
material value of €6.00 was automatically determined from the material
master record of the posted material and rounded off.
The value-based management of material inventory is done automatically
through the updating of stock whenever goods are moved. In addition to quantity-
and value-based updating of stock, account assignment can also be performed in
Cost Accounting. Value-based inventory management is done on the valuation area
level. The valuation area is an organizational level that can correspond to a plant or
company code. The company code, in turn, is derived from the plant via the
assigned valuation area responsible for quantity-based inventory management.
Generally, valuation of inventory is performed on the plant level.
In Volume 1, Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”, we brieﬂy looked at material
valuation and account assignment in relation to consumable material. Updating
of quantity and value (see Fig. 3.8) is based on system settings in addition to
the material type of a material (see also Volume 1, Chap. 3, Sect. 3.2.2). The
system settings control the basic parameters of the valuation: In what level, plant or
company code are the materials evaluated? What goods movements are relevant to
valuation and what accounts are updated for which procedures? The material type is
a ﬁxed parameter that controls whether a material is to be managed in a value- and
stock-based manner. In the accounting views, the material master determines
whether, for instance, various partial stock of a material is to be valuated differently
(split valuation) and what price is to be used for the valuation.
The control of the valuation price of valuated stock requires a material type
that allows inventory management and inventory valuation. The actual valuation,
that is, the valuation price of the material, is based on price control settings in the
material master.
According to these settings, stock can be valuated with a constant price (stan-
dard price) or, adjusting to ﬂuctuations in the procurement price, with a moving
average price. Moving average prices are advisable for raw materials and exter-
nally procured material for which price ﬂuctuations are to be recorded for stock
when they happen. Standard prices are constant and suitable for ﬁnished and semi-
ﬁnished products, especially for products manufactured in-house.
Non-valuated stock is maintained for materials for which quantity-based but not
value-based inventory management is intended. Such stock includes consumable
3.2
Inventory Management
117

materials whose valuation and quantity update are based on the settings of the
respective material type. Because no stock values are updated for these non-
valuated materials, there is no need to maintain accounting views in the material
master. The procurement of these materials is thus done only with account
assignment.
In the case of materials that are maintained in stock on a quantity as well as a
value basis, goods receipt leads to an account-assigned, neutral stock order. The
procured quantity is posted to consumption and the value to a consumption account,
where the respective account assignment object is debited (see also the procurement
of consumption material in Volume 1, Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”). Goods
receipts for non-valuated materials that are managed on a quantity basis lead to an
increase in stock and an update of the material master record. The material value is
posted to the consumption account, and the account-assigned object is debited with
the costs. Non-stock materials represent a special case.
Non-stock materials refer to materials for which neither inventory manage-
ment nor valuation is to take place. As in the case of non-valuated materials,
accounting data is not maintained and procurement is solely done with reference
to an account assignment object. When a goods receipt of such materials occurs,
neither a quantity nor a value update is undertaken, since the procured quantity is
immediately posted as consumption, and the account assignment object is debited
with the costs.
In contrast to the uniform valuation of materials on a plant or company-code
level, split valuation enables a differentiation between the partial stock of a material
with regard to various criteria. Such criteria allow you to evaluate certain partial
stock with differing values within a plant. For instance, split evaluation is done
when a material is simultaneously produced in-house and externally procured,
because material stock from in-house production usually has a different valuation
price than external production. A further criterion and thus a reason for split
valuation is a difference in material qualities and conditions, or batch stock with
varying valuation prices.
Split valuation is performed in the following situations:
•
Batches with varying characteristics
•
Materials of varying sources
•
Materials from various deliveries
•
Materials of varying quality
The differing valuation of a material is done for each partial stock. Thus,
you must indicate which partial stock is concerned regarding logistics and value
for every valuation-relevant procedure, every goods movement, every invoice
receipt and every inventory. Any change in value only applies to that particular
stock and is based on the parameters in the accounting view of the material master
record that determine whether and how a split valuation is to be performed for the
material.
Partial stock is a subquantity of a total stock. The value of the total stock is thus
derived from the sum of the partial stocks and their respective stock values.

3.2.3
Special Stock and Special Procurement Forms
Special stock refers to material stock that is maintained separately from other stock
and is identiﬁed accordingly. This separation is based on special property
circumstances and the spatial separation of the location in which they are situated.
We differentiate between a company’s own and external special stock.
A company’s own special stock is material stock that legally belongs to your
company but is stored at a vendor or customer. The inventory management of this
stock, either unrestricted or in a quality inspection, is done with a neutral storage
location, that is, exclusively on a plant level. In particular, consignment stock and
stock provided to a subcontractor for subcontracting belong to a company’s own
special stock. Both types of special stock will be explained in more detail below.
Customer returnable packaging stock is usually returnable transport packaging
delivered to a customer as packaging for ordered materials. This transport packag-
ing stock is physically situated at the customer location but is legally the property of
the company that shipped it.
Externally owned special stock is stock that legally belongs to an external vendor
or customer but is stored at your company. Unlike a company’s own special stock,
because externally owned special stock is located at your company, it is also
maintained at the storage location level. From the viewpoint of material availabil-
ity, externally owned stock can be unrestricted quality inspection stock as well as
blocked stock. A common type of externally owned special stock is vendor con-
signment goods stock.
Sales order and project stock are stock that is available for the fulﬁllment of a
sales order or project. This stock is permanently allocated to the reference object
(such as a sales order or PSP element) and serves the production of materials
ordered by customers or the execution of a project. Externally owned special
stock also includes all transportation packaging that was used in the external
procurement from a vendor, and is still the property of that vendor and is to be
returned to him by the procuring company.
The following is an overview of consignment and subcontracting, their integration
with logistics core processes and their effects on inventory management (Table 3.2).
Consignment stock refers to stock that is initially delivered to the customer
without being invoiced and remains the property of the seller until its actual
consumption. Only when the stock is withdrawn by the customer is an invoice
issued for the amount withdrawn or consumed. Because a purchase commitment
generally does not exist, consignment stock can be returned to the vendor until
withdrawal by the customer.

If, on the other hand, an agreement exists between the customer and vendor
stipulating that the customer must keep any remaining consignment stock after a
speciﬁed deadline, a transfer posting to the customer’s stock is performed.
Depending on which view is used to examine the consignment, one can differenti-
ate between a customer consignment and a vendor consignment.
For a customer consignment, goods are sent from your company to a customer.
Until these goods are withdrawn by the customer, the material is still among
the valuated stock of the issuing plant and is the property of your company.
The accumulation of special stock at the customer location is done by posting a
goods issue (see Fig. 3.9). Supply of consignment goods is done without invoicing
the customer. It is only a consignment withdrawal, in which a goods issue reduces
customer stock as well as the stock of the issuing plant, that is relevant to billing.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

When consignment stock is returned by the customer, known as a consignment
pick-up, it is removed from the customer special stock and posted back to your
company’s storage location stock. Reduction of special stock through pick-up is not
relevant to billing. Withdrawal of consignment stock can be reversed through
returns. Goods receipt for a consignment return replenishes the special stock and
leads to a credit for the customer.
From the view of procurement logistics, vendor consignment goods represent a
special type of procurement in which a vendor provides material to a company without
demanding payment. The vendor remains the owner of these goods until the company
withdraws something from the consignment stores. The consignment stores, that is,
the consignment stock, are also located at the customer site, which in this case is the
procuring company. Withdrawal of material leads to a liability toward the customer,
who issues an invoice at stipulated periods. From the perspective of inventory
management, the consignment stock is maintained under the same material number
as the company’s own stock. This gives Materials Planning the possibility of consid-
ering the non-valuated consignment stock as unrestricted-use stock.
Procuring consignment stock and subsequent invoicing upon withdrawal require
a price agreement to be in place with the external vendor. Such a price agreement is
stored as a purchasing info record and makes use of the condition technique to save
individual rebates and quantity scales in the system (see also the section on
purchasing info records in Volume 1, Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”). Because
the consignment stock of a particular material can come from more than one vendor
with varying prices, the stock is managed separately with the price of the respective
vendor (see Fig. 3.10).
The actual procurement process for consignment material is done in the same way
as for the external procurement of standard materials, via purchasing requisitions,
purchase orders and outline agreements. From a purchasing perspective, procure-
ment is completed upon goods receipt. The goods receipt of non-valuated consign-
ment stock can be done with or without reference to unrestricted-use, blocked or
quality inspection stock. Invoicing and payment of the material is initiated only after
its withdrawal from stock.
The withdrawal and consumption of consignment material is done via a goods
issue from the unrestricted-use consignment stock of the vendor. Withdrawal leads
to a liability toward the external vendor.
Because the vendor cannot directly track the goods withdrawal, the liabilities are
settled periodically without an invoice receipt. Payment is done via a settlement run
by generating a credit note for the respective vendor.
3.2.3.1
Subcontracting
Another special case in external procurement is subcontracting, in which a com-
pany orders material from an external vendor and supplies that vendor, the subcon-
tractor, with some or all of the components needed to produce the ordered material.
In this section, we will examine the procurement and subcontracting of a ﬁnished
3.2
Inventory Management
121

product from the viewpoint of purchasing and inventory management. The pro-
curement process begins by ordering the ﬁnished product from an external vendor.
The ﬁnished product is ordered through a purchasing requisition, a purchase
order or a scheduling agreement with a subcontracting line. Such an order not only
includes information regarding the material to be produced, but also, in one or more
subitems, information regarding the components that are provided to the supplier
for the subcontracting job. The components are either entered manually or derived
with the aid of a BOM (bill of material) explosion for the procured ﬁnished product.
The physical provision of components is usually done via a transfer posting from
unrestricted-use stock to vendor consignment stock. Alternatively, the required
components can be provided by a second vendor. In such a case, a purchase order
is placed to the second vendor for the required components. In both cases, the
components belong to the company and are maintained from an inventory manage-
ment standpoint as special stock and identiﬁed as vendor consignment stock (see
Fig. 3.11).
After manufacture or processing, the subcontractor supplies the ordered product.
Goods receipt not only leads to an increase in stock of the ﬁnished product, but also

to the consumption of components from the vendor consignment stock. To ensure
exact allocation of the receipt of the ﬁnished product as well as the component
consumption from the vendor consignment stock, goods receipt is performed with
reference to the order. The consumption of components for each original goods
issue item takes place exclusively from the vendor consignment stock. Consump-
tion of components that deviates from the component quantities indicated in the
order is either recorded in the goods receipt or posted as a subsequent adjustment.
3.2.3.2
Third-Party Order Processing
The material itself or the purchasing procedure and the involved system settings
determine the way in which a material is procured for a particular sales order.
Procurement is carried out from an available storage location stock via internal or
external procurement, triggered by a purchasing requisition, an order, a planned or
production order, or by a delivery from an external vendor. Third-party order
processing is an order placed with an external vendor with the stipulation that the

order is to be delivered to a third party. The customer thus orders from one
company, but delivery is performed by an external supplier who sends the goods
directly to the customer and invoices the company for them.
The decision to have an item sent by a supplier rather than the respective
company is done on the level of the corresponding order item. A sales order can
thus consist of several different standard and third-party items. The third-party
items can be entered manually or generated automatically, based on parameters in
the material master, such as when a sold material is to be exclusively procured
externally.
When saving a sales order with third-party items, the items to be procured
externally generate a purchase requisition item. The conversion of a purchase
requisition to a purchase order is described in Volume 1, Chap. 4, “Procurement
Logistics”. For the conversion, the system takes on the data of the sales order,
including the customer delivery address. The order is transmitted to the supplier,
who then delivers the goods to the ﬁnal customer (see Fig. 3.12).
Third-party processing is goods movement from a supplier to a customer in
which the inventory management of the ordering company is not affected. In order
to document this step, and to enable a value-based update of stock, a statistical
goods receipt can be performed from the view of inventory management. Such a
statistical goods receipt has the same effect as a goods receipt for an order with an
account assignment: The stock is not updated in its quantity, but only with regard to

value as consumption. The update of the order value is posted to a clearing account
for the subsequent invoice veriﬁcation.
In the event of an external procurement procedure, the vendor sends a vendor
invoice to the ordering company. The purchasing procedure is completed when a
billing document is generated for the customer. To prevent the customer from
receiving the invoice before receiving the goods from the vendor, the system can be
set such that a statistical goods receipt must ﬁrst have occurred before a vendor invoice
can be entered. The goods receipt can be triggered automatically by a shipping
notiﬁcation from a vendor. When a statistical goods receipt has been previously
posted, the clearing account is settled through receipt of the vendor invoice. Customer
billing based on the calculated and delivered quantities is usually done only after the
vendor invoice has been entered in the invoice veriﬁcation process.
Alternatively, the system can be set such that order-related billing is done with
reference to the original order quantity immediately after the sales order is
generated.
3.2.4
Handling Units
The so-called handling unit (HU) is a physical unit consisting of a material to be
packaged and the packaging itself. It can be identiﬁed by a speciﬁc number. The HU
is much more than a simple shipping unit, and in Handling Unit Management
(HUM), it represents a package management system that includes all logistics
processes.
Handling Unit Management (see Fig. 3.13) enables the mapping of purely
packaging-controlled logistics by observing not the goods movement of an individ-
ual material, but rather the logistics movements of the HUs containing those
materials. This type of observation allows a simpliﬁed, systematic mapping of
goods movements and an optimization of logistics core processes with regard to a
purely package-related processing of material movements.
Handling units can be used in all logistics processes and across multiple pro-
cesses, as well as outside of your own SAP system. That is why every HU has a
speciﬁc, scannable identiﬁcation number that is either assigned within an SAP
system based on internal number ranges or across several systems. This speciﬁc
number allows detailed information on the content and packaging of a handling unit

to be accessed at any time, and enables the cross-process, chronological documen-
tation of all goods movements of an HU. To identify the handling unit, a serial
shipper container code (SSCC) is generally used. This 18-digit code serves to
identify logistics units and is part of the coding standard EAN-128.
Handling units are supported in all logistics processes, and in addition to the pure
inventory management information (regarding what material in what quantities and
which packaging makes up an HU) also include the current status of a handling unit.
This includes whether or not a goods receipt or issue has taken place or been
announced, and the current location in the warehouse. All business transactions are
recorded in the history of the handling unit and enable seamless documentation and
evaluation of its life cycle (see also Fig. 3.32).
In SAP applications, handling units consist of an HU header and HU items (see
Fig. 3.14). In addition to the speciﬁc identiﬁcation number, the header information
also includes the packaging material used, the total weight and dimensions of the
handling unit and the history. The items contain the packaged materials and the
packaged quantity.
Detailed data of a handling unit
Figure 3.14 shows the detailed data of a “nested” handling unit. On the
uppermost level, the image shows a container as transport equipment
(Packaging Material TM-080). This container has two packages (Packaging
Material PK-101), each of which contains a packaged material, 101-110 and
100-110.
Handling units represent a physical unit consisting of shipping materials and the
materials they contain. The purpose of shipping materials is to enclose the material
or keep it together. We can differentiate between shipping materials serving as

loading equipment and “pure” packaging material. Traditional loading equipment
includes pallets, pallet boxes and containers. Packaging materials are usually boxes,
plastic foils and cardboard.
A handling unit can itself be packaged and then represents a new handling unit.
In addition, all packing functions are available to pack, repack or unpack a handling
unit. Handling units can be manually created or generated automatically upon
goods receipt or in the packing zone of a warehouse. Packing is a separate function
within logistics, where a shipping material can be entered in a packaging dialogue
at any time and a handling unit can be subsequently created.
Depending on the warehouse management system used (SAP WM or SAP
EWM), the automatic generation of handling units is based on the packaging
recommendations saved in the system, corresponding regulations and the packag-
ing speciﬁcations. In SAP ERP, automatic packaging is done according to the
settings stored in the system per delivery type and the stored packaging
recommendations. The actual shipping materials are maintained in an SAP system
as packing materials. Packing materials are materials having a special material type
that are suitable for use in packaging.
Manual packing in SAP ERP is usually done with a reference document for the
inbound or outbound delivery of materials. Manual packing in relation to outbound
deliveries with SAP ERP is discussed in Volume 1, Chap. 6, “Distribution Logistics”.
In addition to the possibility of creating and editing HUs with a document
reference, SAP ERP allows you to use a packing station (see Fig. 3.15).
This function is especially designed for employees in the warehouse who
physically pack materials and enter data either via a keyboard or scanner. In
addition, the exact weight can be determined using a scale connected to the system;
the corresponding values are transferred to the dialogue screen. Packing with a
packing station can be used for outbound as well as inbound deliveries. The left side
of Fig. 3.15 shows the structure of the handling unit with the packaging material,
and the right side indicates the material and the partial quantity to be packed.

Warehouse Management with WM
SAP ERP is the core of companywide data entry and processing. As described in the
previous section, inventory management, from a logistics standpoint, deals with the
quantity- and value-based data entry and processing of material stock, and generally
serves the documentation, planning and entry of all goods movements. In this
section, we turn our attention to the physical movement of stock with WM.
Physical goods movement can be processed with the aid of the warehouse
management function integrated into ERP. Warehouse Management (WM) not
only offers an overview of the total quantity of a material in the warehouse, but
also provides information on the location of a speciﬁc material. Integrating ware-
house management with inventory management is of central importance because
for the mapping of goods receipt and issue processes, inventory management
postings represent either the trigger or the completion of warehouse management
activity. One example of this is sales order processing in distribution logistics, in
which the connection to delivery processing enables the picking of goods with
reference to the delivery. The completion of warehouse management in this case is
goods issue with reference to the delivery.
Figure 3.16 shows an overview of warehouse management with SAP ERP and
its technical-process connection to inventory management. Integration of ware-
house management is primarily based on the fact that goods receipt and issue
postings trigger follow-up processes in warehouse management. These transfer
requirements, picking and putaway, and operative stock transfer of material are
mapped and controlled by a transfer order.
A special type of warehouse management with SAP ERP is Lean WM –
inventory management on the warehouse level that enables the picking of
deliveries. In contrast to a WM system in which goods movements and changes
in inventory are done on the bin location level, Lean WM performs inventory
management exclusively on the storage location level. Stock quantities are thus
only visible within the Inventory Management function. Like WM, Lean WM also
generates transfer orders. However, a transport order generated for a delivery serves
as a picking list containing the articles and quantities to be withdrawn. Because no
bin location information is recorded, Lean WM can only be used for the processing
of goods receipts and issues. Transfer postings and stock transfers are not possible.
We speak of decentralized warehouse management when the warehouse manage-
ment system is operated as an autonomous, decentralized system (Logistics Execu-
tion System). WM can function in an integrated manner as well as decentralized as an
LES (Logistics Execution System) with any ERP system. Decentralized warehouse
management enables you to operate a warehouse that is used for storage as well as in
the distribution of goods independent of a central ERP system.
Logistics processes are closely coordinated with one another; a system failure
can thus have critical consequences. One major reason for decentralized implemen-
tation on other hardware is better performance in addition to a guarantee of
continual availability of the decentralized warehouse management system and a
minimization of failure risk.
128

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Figure 3.17 shows a diagram of the technical-process connection of a
decentralized, ERP-based warehouse management system.
The integration of both systems is primarily done by replicating inbound and
outbound deliveries from the ERP system to the decentralized warehouse manage-
ment system. Actual warehouse management, the physical realization of warehouse
activities resulting from deliveries, occurs decentrally with the aid of transfer
orders. When the planned goods movement based on the deliveries is carried out,
the central system conﬁrms the delivery to the lead ERP system and triggers a
change in stock. This decentralized processing causes the physical change in stock
to be upstream of the resulting inventory posting, because inventory management
takes place in the lead ERP system.

As an ERP-based warehouse management system, WM offers the opportunity to
map an entire warehouse complex, including its physical and logistics structure,
right up to the lowest bin location level. In the following section, we will use a
concrete example of goods receipt and issue to provide an overview of warehouse
management with WM (SAP ERP) and its core functions.

3.3.1
Warehouse Structure and Integration
Without the use of a warehouse management system, the storage location would be
the lowest level on which stock could be managed. As a rule, the storage location
represents the physical location of material stock or reﬂects the various storage
facilities of a warehouse complex. When WM is used as a warehouse management
system, quantity-based inventory management is still done on the level of the
storage locations. Mapping of the storage facility – the physical structure of
the warehouse and the internal structures of the warehouse complex – occurs with
the aid of ﬂexible organizational structures.
Every warehouse has its own structure according to which goods are stored
depending on their composition and space requirements. In automated warehouses,
this structure is based on existing automation technology. In the age of eBusiness
and just-in-time practices, the ratio of automated warehouses is steadily increasing.
The term automation refers to machines taking on physical warehouse functions as
well as warehouse control, or material ﬂow computers performing process control
and automatic control tasks.
Automated warehouses are generally either purely pallet warehouses with
picking systems and material replenishment functions, or container warehouses in
which picking is done on a “goods-to-person” basis. Warehouse automation is often
combined with manually operated storage systems in accordance with process
requirements. The organizational elements of WM enable individual mapping of
the respective warehouse structures.
This book does not delve into warehouse automation technologies and their
system integration into SAP Business Suite. The Material Flow System (MFS) and
the Radio Frequency Framework (RF Framework), both components of SAP
EWM, are brieﬂy discussed in Sect. 3.4.6, “Cross-Warehouse Functions” below.
The warehouse number pools all organizational and physical characteristics of a
warehouse and, in practice, typically represents the actual warehouse building or
building complex in which the warehouse is located. The warehouse number, as the
highest organizational element, thus divides the company from the viewpoint of
warehouse logistics and is the basis of various control parameters in WM (see also
Fig. 3.19).
A warehouse number is generally divided into several storage types. Each
storage type deﬁnes spatial or organizational circumstances – a storage section,
storage equipment or a speciﬁc storage zone. In any case, the storage type describes
a speciﬁc area within a warehouse that is characterized either by an identiﬁed space
or organizational procedure. Storage types include one or more storage sections and
form the basis for storage-type-speciﬁc control parameters that especially control
putaway and picking as well as the inventory-taking procedure of the corresponding
storage type. It is also possible to save storage-type-speciﬁc material data. The most
common physical storage types are:
•
Bulk storage
•
Open storage
3.3
Warehouse Management with WM
131

•
High rack storage
•
Shelf storage
•
Picking areas
A special kind of storage is represented by interim storage types. The interim
storage type forms the organizational interface between warehouse management
and inventory management. Integration is initially based on the type of movement
in inventory management, the central instrument for the control of goods
movements and a corresponding reference movement type in warehouse manage-
ment. The reference movement type or WM movement type controls the material
movements from the viewpoint of warehouse management and decides on the
interim storage type to be used. In the case of a goods movement for a purchase
order, the system ﬁrst determines the relevant inventory management movement
type and then the allocated WM movement type. Updating of inventory is subse-
quently done in the goods receipt area, a typical interim storage type – a storage
type that is used jointly by inventory management and warehouse management.
They especially include:
•
Goods receipt areas
•
Goods issue zones
•
Posting change zones
•
Interim storage area for differences
The picking area is an organizational element within a storage type or section
that logistically pools storage sections for the purpose of removal based on identical
picking activities. Unlike the storage section that pools a logistical grouping of
storage bins based on their common putaway strategy, the picking area considers
the respective picking strategy. For outbound deliveries, the picking area speeds up
the shipping procedure by enabling parallel picking by splitting the picking list into
corresponding picking areas (see Fig. 3.18).
From the viewpoint of stock placement control, the storage section pools those
storage bins with the same or similar characteristics. As a physical or logical
subunit of a storage type, it represents the counterpart of the picking area, and
serves as an organizational aid for material placement. The criteria for pooling
depend on the respective characteristics of the storage bins or on the characteristics
of the materials stored there. An example would be pooling based on the load
transfer frequency of a material (a fast- or slow-moving item) or based on physical
characteristics (such as weight or size). These storage-bin-related criteria often
have to do with the distance to the load transfer point, the load capacity of the
storage bin or the temperature. High rack storage, for instance, mapped as a storage
type, consists of several storage bins of varying sizes. The storage bins in the lower
sections are often larger to accommodate especially heavy or bulky material.
Storage bins in the upper levels are generally smaller, with the front area reserved
for fast-moving items and the rear for materials with a lower transfer frequency.
A storage bin is the smallest spatial unit in WM and typically represents the
physical bin to which a storage type is speciﬁcally allocated. Storage bins are
speciﬁcally assigned using a coordinate system. For example, the coordinates
132
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

01-05-05 specify a storage bin in Aisle 1, Column 5 on Level 5. With the exception
of a few alphanumeric characters, any letter and number combination may be used
for storage bin coordinates, depending on operative needs.
From the view of the warehouse management system, storage bins represent
master data to which additional characteristics can be entered. In addition to the
maximum weight that a storage bin can carry, such other characteristics can include
the total capacity and storage bin type. The storage bin type inﬂuences placing
strategy, such as when the system searches for a storage bin based on a certain pallet
type that is to be placed into a bin.
Physical loading and unloading of trucks is performed at the storage locations.
To optimize the picking and placing processes in a warehouse, these doors are
situated near so-called staging areas. From the system view, the doors and staging
areas are organizational units to which warehouse numbers are allocated. The doors
are usually allocated to staging areas and conﬁgured for subsequent use for goods
receipt, goods issue, cross-docking or ﬂow-through.
Unlike the doors, through which materials enter and leave the warehouse,
staging areas serve as interim storage sites for materials. Because of their vicinity
to the doors, they can be conﬁgured for goods receipt or issue. In the case of
goods receipt, they serve to temporarily store materials that have been taken in for
goods issue and must subsequently be transported into storage. In their function for
goods issue, they serve as interim storage for picked materials that must subse-
quently be loaded for shipment at their assigned door.
In contrast to the physical warehouse structure that is mapped in the system with
the organizational elements mentioned above, so-called quants are used to manage
transactions of quantities on the lowest storage bin level. From a management point

of view, a quant is a certain quantity of materials having the same characteristics
that are situated in one speciﬁc, clearly identiﬁable storage bin. A quant is generated
by the system when materials are placed in an empty storage bin, updated through
picking and placing, and automatically deleted by the system when there is no
longer any stock in that particular storage bin. Materials with differing charac-
teristics, such as different batches, are maintained in a single storage bin as two
quants (Fig. 3.31 illustrates the inventory data of a quant).
Like a quant, a storage unit aids not only in the structuring of a warehouse, but
also in the logistical pooling of physical material quantities within a warehouse.
WM employs its Storage Unit Management to manage a speciﬁc material quantity
such as pallets or containers belonging together as a unit. Storage units can be
composed of one or more material items, and are always identiﬁed by a speciﬁc
code. Without the use of the activated Storage Unit Management on the warehouse
number level, all material stock is managed as quants on the storage bin level (see
Fig. 3.19). Activation of Storage Unit Management causes inventory management
activity on the pallet and storage unit level, whereby a storage unit may consist of
one or more quants. Several storage units can be situated in a single storage bin. The
activation of storage units serves to optimize storage capacity and control material
ﬂow by allowing the movement of heterogeneous pallets having more than one
material as a single unit within the warehouse. One major advantage is that you can
determine where each storage unit is located in the warehouse, what material
quantity is stored in it, and which activities have already been completed or are
planned for that storage unit (see also Fig. 3.30).
WM is fully integrated in the SAP ERP system. Material movements, goods
receipts, picking and shipment of materials for sales orders thus lead to physical
movement in the warehouse. Most goods movements occurring in Warehouse
Management are triggered in Inventory Management.
Goods receipts that take place in a storage location administered by WM
automatically generate a posting to the storage bin of the allocated interim storage
type. The interim storage type in this case is usually the goods receipt area from
which, in a second step, the goods are posted to a storage bin in the warehouse.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

In the case of goods issues without an outbound delivery, the material is posted
to a goods issue zone after picking. Because the posting causes a corresponding
reduction in total stock in Inventory Management, posting to the storage bin of
this interim storage type ﬁrst triggers a quant with a negative quantity. In this case,
the accounting goods issue posting is accomplished before actual goods issue in the
warehouse. Adjustment of the negative quantity occurs upon physical stock
removal to the goods issue zone.
The various possibilities for stock placement and removal and the available
strategies will be explored in the following sections.
Storage locations can be set in the system as HU-managed. Stock situated in an
HU-managed storage location is generally packed and maintained as handling
units. Mixed stock composed of packed and unpacked materials is not provided
for in such cases. For packing procedures, that is, the packing or unpacking of a
handling unit, a second storage location, a so-called partner storage location, must
also be indicated. The partner storage location is then used for stock transfer from a
storage location with HU management to a storage location that is not HU-man-
aged. Stock transfers and goods movements are therefore not possible with the
indication of a handling unit. If no handling unit is indicated, the system does not
generate a material document for the posting, but rather a delivery.
Figure 3.20 shows integration with Inventory Management from the view
of goods movement. Stock movements are done with or without reference to an
inbound or outbound delivery. Actual stock movement is controlled with the aid of
transfer orders.

The transfer order is the central document for control of stock movement in
WM. Every material movement in a warehouse requires a transfer order that
contains all information required to execute the physical transportation into or out
of the warehouse or from one storage bin to another. In this regard, there is no
differentiation between physical movement and pure transfer postings. Transfer
postings can occur when materials are transferred from a quality inspection to
unrestricted-use stock.
Transfer orders contain all information needed by the Warehouse Management
system to execute stock movement. In addition to the materials and quantities to be
moved, such information also includes precise data indicating from where the
material is to be moved (source storage bin) and to where (destination storage bin).
•
The source storage bin indicates the storage bin from where materials are taken
or the goods receipt area (interim storage type) from where they are to be taken
and placed into storage.
•
The destination storage bin determines the storage bin in which the materials are
to be placed or the goods issue zone (interim storage type) via which they are to
be removed.
Return storage bins are used for special situations. When an entire pallet is being
removed and picking of a speciﬁc partial quantity is to take place, the return storage
bin can be used to hold quantities no longer needed if the opened pallet is not to be
placed back into storage. Determination of storage bins is done automatically
according to the putaway and picking strategies determined by the system. The
subsequent sections will focus on the basics of controlling putaway and picking.
Transfer orders for putaway or picking can be created manually as a single
document or generated with reference to a preceding document. Preceding
documents in such a case would either be transport demand from a previous goods
movement, delivery documents, material documents or posting change notices.
Conﬁrming a transfer order acknowledges that stock movement has taken place
and the required material quantity has actually been transported from one storage
bin to another. Whether or not conﬁrmation is required depends either on the
movement type used or on system settings for a particular storage type. The transfer
order or individual transport order items can be canceled until conﬁrmation has
taken place. Conﬁrming a transfer order completes the document. If the actual
quantity deviates from the target quantity during conﬁrmation, the resulting differ-
ence in quantity is automatically posted to a so-called interim storage area for
differences.
Conﬁrmation of a transfer order can be either in the foreground or background.
Conﬁrmation in the foreground refers to a manual procedure in which the individual
transaction steps are monitored on screen and default values can be changed.
Conﬁrmation in the background is done automatically by the system.
Transfer requirements contain information on the planned goods movements
and are used to plan or trigger subsequent stock movements. Unlike transfer orders,
which contain detailed information on the stock movement to be executed, trans-
port requirements do not include information on the storage type or bin related to
136
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

putaway or picking. The header and item data of a transfer requirement includes
administrative, material- and quantity-speciﬁc information on the planned goods
movement, as well as the date and direction (picking or putaway). Transfer
requirements are the preceding documents for transfer orders and are usually
automatically generated by the system based on stock postings. For goods
movements that begin directly in WM, transport requirements can be manually
created. The transition from a transfer requirement to a transfer order can either be
performed manually or automatically in the background.
3.3.2
Inbound Delivery
Inbound deliveries refer to the physical inward movement of materials to a ware-
house. Inward movement is generally done on the basis of external procurement,
returns or stock transfers. Each goods receipt leads to an increase in warehouse
stock and the corresponding stock movement. From the warehouse management
view, an inbound delivery can occur with or without reference to a document. When
goods receipts are processed with reference, the system refers to an incoming
delivery or transfer requirement. An inbound delivery without reference does not
refer to a previous goods receipt posting in Inventory Management.
Upon goods receipt, WM records all transactions for the materials to be stored.
From reading the barcode, to a warehouse employee identifying the materials, to
placing the material in a destination storage bin, the procedures triggered by goods
issue in the warehouse are transparent and usually occur automatically. We differ-
entiate between the following goods receipt types:
•
Goods receipt with reference to a delivery
•
Goods receipt without reference to a delivery
•
Goods receipts without prior posting in Inventory Management
We will now turn to an explanation of these types of goods receipt.
3.3.2.1
Goods Receipt with Reference to a Delivery
Goods receipts with reference to a delivery are executed without previous genera-
tion of a transfer requirement (see Fig. 3.20). Such a goods receipt with reference
can be illustrated with a process example.
Goods receipt based on a purchasing order represents the completion of an
external procurement. External procurement, the generation of a purchasing order
and the signiﬁcance of the delivery in the ordering process are covered in Volume 1,
Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”. In a warehouse managed with WM, the receipt
of materials delivered by an external vendor is the starting point for the subsequent
warehouse activities. In the case of goods receipt with reference to a delivery, the
delivery itself represents the starting point. In the selection of the delivery, the
3.3
Warehouse Management with WM
137

operator is supported by the system via its Inbound Delivery Monitor. Depending
on the selected delivery, the list view shows information such as the deliveries
requiring putaway (see Fig. 3.21).
Deliveries to be placed into stock can be selected and form the reference for the
generation of the transfer order (see Fig. 3.22). The transfer order takes on the
relevant data from the preceding document and, depending on the type of placement
saved in the system, determines the destination storage bin in which the material is
to be put away.
By activating the storage unit management system, each handling unit to be put
away corresponds to a storage unit. When the transfer order is created, the storage
unit’s destination storage bin has already been determined by the system, and the
handling unit and storage unit are known to the system based on a common,
speciﬁcally assigned number. For subsequent identiﬁcation via barcode, labels
can now be printed for each storage unit (see Fig. 3.23).
Transfer order for an inbound delivery
Figure 3.22 shows the generation of a transfer order for Inbound Delivery
180000181 from External Vendor 3000. The delivery contained several
packed material items of 20 units each of the material LEHU-002. Each
item was delivered packaged and is identiﬁed by a speciﬁc handling unit
number in the system. According to system settings in this example, a
separate transfer order is to be generated for each handling unit.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

To acknowledge that a handling unit to be placed into stock has actually been put
into its destination storage bin, the transfer order is conﬁrmed (see Fig. 3.24). The
work list to be conﬁrmed can also be displayed and selected via the inbound
delivery screen. Whether or not conﬁrmation is required, that is, if the system
must be explicitly informed that the materials have reached their destination,
depends on the system settings of the respective movement type.
In addition to a subsequent editing of the destination storage bin suggested by the
system, manual conﬁrmation allows you to enter a quantity difference if the actual
quantity delivered does not match the planned quantity taken over from the inbound
delivery.
Conﬁrming a transfer order
Figure 3.24 shows manual conﬁrmation of a transfer order in the foreground
for the placement of 20 units of Material LEHU-002 to Storage Bin 12-01-03
in Storage Location 0050 of Plant 3000. The Handling Unit number in which
this material is situated corresponds to the number of Storage Unit
00130005670000005696.
Figure 3.25 shows the destination data of the transfer order with the
conﬁrmed item. The source storage bin data is the goods receipt area for
external receipts (Storage Type 902) with Storage section 001 and reference
to Delivery 0180000181. The system automatically determined the destina-
tion storage bin. In this example, the material was placed in Storage Type
120, high rack storage, in Area 001 and in Storage Bin 12-01-03.

From the warehouse management view, stock movement is completed: The
materials moved with reference to a delivery are stored in the storage bin. To
update stock data, the goods receipt is posted in Inventory Management. This
posting, the quantity- and value-based update of stock, is documented in the
material document. The posting of the goods movement in Inventory Management
is either done automatically in the background or manually, for instance with the
aid of the Inbound Delivery Monitor.
3.3.2.1
Goods Receipt Without Reference to a Delivery
Stock movements in WM can also be triggered without a direct document reference
to a delivery. Putaway in the warehouse management system in such a case is
preceded by goods movement in Inventory Management that has already generated
a quant in the storage bin of the goods receipt interim storage area (interim storage

140

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

type) and a transfer requirement (see Fig. 3.20). A transfer order for the transfer
requirement can be created manually or automatically by the system.
3.3.3
Transfer Order and Quantity Deviations
The transfer order serves the internal transfer of materials from the goods receipt
area to one or more storage bins that have been determined automatically by WM
(see Fig. 3.25). After the stock movement, a warehouse employee conﬁrms the
transfer order by entering the moved materials manually or with a scanner. Any
quantity deviations between goods receipt posts already entered in Inventory
Management and the quantities actually conﬁrmed are subsequently adjusted in
Inventory Management.
3.3.3.1
Goods Receipts Without Prior Posting in Inventory Management
Goods receipts without a prior posting in Inventory Management and without
reference to an inbound delivery are executed directly in Warehouse Management
through the generation of a transfer order. The material to be stored is generally
already in the goods receipt interim storage area of the warehouse. The transfer
order is generated without reference and creates a negative quant (negative stock
quantity) at the storage bin of the goods receipt interim storage area. The materials
are placed from the goods receipt interim storage into the determined storage
bin and the transfer order is conﬁrmed. Once the procedure is conﬁrmed, the
material is available in the system. Adjustment for the negative quant in the
goods receipt interim storage area is done when the goods receipt is posted in
Inventory Management. The result is a positive quant on the destination storage bin
of the material.
3.3.3.2
Stock Placement Control
The purpose of Stock Placement Control is to efﬁciently ﬁnd an optimal storage bin
while utilizing available stock capacity and considering operational requirements.
Automatic determination of a storage bin upon creation of a transfer order is
performed in a ﬂexible order stored in the system.
Determination procedures are primarily based on search strategies that ﬁrst
attempt to ﬁnd a suitable storage type. Storage type determination is controlled
by a search sequence in which a storage type indicator from the material master as
well as the indicator of the stock type and special stock are factors.
After the system has determined the storage type, storage section determination
is performed for the appropriate storage type if the storage section check is
activated. Actual determination in this case is done in a search sequence deﬁned
3.3
Warehouse Management with WM
141

in the system. The storage section indicator and storage class inﬂuence this search.
The storage section indicator controls the search, for instance with regard to fast- or
slow-moving materials. The storage class classiﬁes dangerous goods with regard to
the storage conditions to be determined. Depending on the storage class (such as
whether a material is an explosive substance or ﬂammable liquid), the system
determines the storage type and storage section in which materials may be placed.
Determination of the destination storage bin is performed according to the
putaway strategy stored in the system: WM selects the storage bin (according to
operational requirements) using a series of preconﬁgured strategies, bin capacity
restrictions and master data parameters for the materials to be stored. WM has
putaway strategies that you can alter with your own extensions and logic. The most
important strategies are:
•
Fixed storage bin
With the ﬁxed storage bin strategy, the system selects a storage bin based on the
bin to which a material has been directly assigned in the material master.
•
Open storage
Open storage refers to storage sections of a storage type for which one single
storage been has been deﬁned.
•
Addition to existing stock
This putaway strategy selects storage bins in which stock of the material to be
stored is already situated. The prerequisite for adding additional quantities is the
presence of sufﬁcient residual capacity, which is automatically veriﬁed by the
system. If no capacity is available, the system continues storage bin determina-
tion with the next strategy, attempting to ﬁnd the next free bin.
•
Next empty storage bin
This search strategy, in which the system suggests the next empty storage bin for
putaway, is frequently used for high rack and shelf warehouses. The search for
the next empty storage bin is performed using an alterable sorting sequence that
prevents a one-sided utilization of the warehouse and can be controlled via
storage bin coordinates.
•
Putaway according to pallets
The goal of this strategy is to store only the same storage unit types in a single
storage bin. The storage unit type refers to a certain combination of loading
equipment and packed materials. Depending on the system settings, it can be
deﬁned for a speciﬁc storage bin type, such as only pallets having certain
dimensions, or so that mixed storage with a variety of storage unit types is permitted.
•
Bulk storage
Like the storage unit strategy, the “bulk storage” strategy deﬁnes how many
columns and what stack height per storage bin are allowed. The stack height
often depends on the material and can be controlled via the bulk storage indica-
tor. Such material usually has a large space requirement that needs to be
accessed quickly and requires clear structuring.
•
Near the picking bin
Depending on system settings, this strategy ﬁrst tries to determine the ﬁxed bin
location of a material. If putaway is not possible for capacity reasons, the
142
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

material is placed in a reserve storage space close to the ﬁxed bin and is picked
during from-bin transfer. Alternatively, the material can be immediately placed
into the reserve storage space without a previous ﬁxed bin check.
3.3.4
Goods Issue
Goods issue refers to the physical departure of materials from the warehouse. This
departure is usually due to internal material consumption, material issue or goods
issue to customers within the context of sales and distribution logistics. Every goods
issue results in a corresponding stock movement and reduces the material stock.
Just as in the case of goods receipt, goods issue can occur with or without reference
to a reference document. For goods issue processing with reference, the system
refers to a delivery or transfer request (see Fig. 3.20).
In the goods issue process, WM records all transactions for materials to be
removed. Processes triggered by goods issue in the warehouse (such as picking,
packaging and staging of the materials) are transparent and generally executed
automatically. We differentiate between the following types of goods issue:
•
Goods issue with reference to a delivery
•
Goods issue without reference to a delivery
•
Goods issue with manual picking
All three will be explained in more detail below.
3.3.4.1
Goods Issue with Reference to a Delivery
For a goods issue with reference to a delivery, the delivery replaces the actual
transfer requirement, and the transfer order is generated with reference to a delivery
note. We provide a process example of a goods issue with reference to a delivery
below.
Goods issue for a delivery represents the conclusion of the sales process in
distribution logistics. Sales and sales order processing and the creation of deliveries
were discussed in Volume 1, Chap. 6, “Distribution Logistics”. In a warehouse
managed using WM, goods issue to a customer is the culmination of a series of
warehouse activities beginning with the selection of deliveries to be processed. The
system supports the operator with its Delivery Monitor, which allows you to choose
the day’s workload to be picked. For manual processing, the delivery to be picked is
selected and a transfer order is subsequently generated for the issue.
The delivery to be issued is selected, representing the reference for the genera-
tion of the transfer order (see Fig. 3.28). The transfer order assumes the relevant
data from the preceding document and, depending on the issue data stored in the
system, determines the source storage bin from which the material is to be picked
and the destination storage bin to which the material is to be moved. Several
3.3
Warehouse Management with WM
143

transfer order items can result from a single goods issue item, depending on whether
or not the quantity to be moved is to be picked from various source storage bins.
Outbound delivery and the day’s workload
Figure 3.26 shows Outbound Delivery 80016882 for one unit of Material
LEHU-002. Delivery is executed from the central warehouse with the Ware-
house Number 050, which is managed with WM. The goods issue requires a
transfer order (WM-TO), and picking has not yet occurred.
Figure 3.27 shows the Delivery Monitor with the deliveries to be picked.
Delivery 80016485 is selected, and the transfer order is generated in the
foreground.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Manual transfer order before saving
Figure 3.28 shows the transfer order generated in the foreground for Delivery
80016882 before it is saved by the operator. The system has already deter-
mined the quantity to be picked of Material LEHU-002, as well as the source
storage bin and storage unit. The material is taken from Storage Type 120
(high rack storage), Area 001 (fast-moving), the storage bin with the
coordinates 12-01-01 and moved to Shipping Area 916. A log of this storage
bin determination is shown in Fig. 3.34.
Picking refers to actual removal of material from the storage bins and moving it
to a destination storage bin. Depending on operational needs, shipping materials
can also be determined, and a pick HU (picking handling unit) can be automatically
generated for the operator to pack the picked quantity. The pick HU is then directly
assumed in the delivery; further packaging is usually not necessary. For an HU-
managed storage location or if expressly desired, picking is done by removing the
respective handling unit, which can then be repacked in a pick HU.
To conﬁrm that the picking quantity has in fact been removed from the source
storage location and a goods movement has taken place, the transfer order is
conﬁrmed. The work list to be conﬁrmed can also be displayed and selected via
the Delivery Monitor (see Fig. 3.29).
Two-step picking is a process in which the materials to be removed for several
deliveries or transfer orders are ﬁrst taken from the storage bins. In a second step,
Fig. 3.28 Generating a transfer order for picking

145

they are allocated to their corresponding reference documents. The advantage of
this two-step process is the ability to pick a large amount of business transactions,
thus minimizing the total number of picking actions. Because removal and
subsequent allocation to deliveries or transfer orders represent two separate ware-
house procedures, a transfer order is generated for each step.
In the event that the quantity actually picked differs from that indicated in the
transfer order, the difference quantity is determined by the system and recorded in
the transfer order item. The partially picked quantity is updated in the delivery
document and the respective status is set for partial picking. If partial picking has
been stipulated with the customer, the delivery is generated as a partial delivery and
another delivery is created for the quantity not yet processed. It is also possible to
perform further picking for the delivery, especially if you want to avoid a partial
delivery. In such a case, another transfer order is generated for that delivery, and the
remaining quantity is subsequently picked.
In this process example, picking of stock was performed from a single storage
unit, based on the activated storage unit management. The storage unit with which
the stock is managed is allocated to a speciﬁc storage bin and can consist of several
quants (see Figs. 3.30, 3.31). Removal and conﬁrmation reduce the total stock of the
allocated storage bin.
Fig. 3.30 Storage unit in a source storage bin

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Storage unit
Figure 3.30 shows Storage Unit 130005670000001711, which is located at
Storage Bin 12-01-01 in the high rack storage of the central warehouse. In
addition to general data such as weight and status, the storage unit includes
information regarding any blocks or the recent movement data. In this
example, movement was in the form of Transfer Order 213.
From the viewpoint of warehouse management, conﬁrming the transfer order
generally represents the conclusion of stock movement in a distribution process. To
update inventory data, a goods issue takes place for a delivery. As in the case of a
goods receipt, this posting serves to update quantity and value of stock, and is also
documented by a material document. Posting of goods movement to inventory
management is either automatically done in the background or manually
performed, such as with the aid of the Delivery Monitor.

Quants were explained above in Sect. 3.3.1, “Warehouse Structure and Integra-
tion”. Based on the goods movement presented in our example, we can now
examine the effects on stock. The quant not only includes organizational allocation
to a storage bin and storage unit, but also precise information on the total stock and
available stock of the stored materials. The available stock is based on the quantities
yet to be picked or placed in the transfer orders not yet conﬁrmed. In addition to the
most recent goods movement and the related transfer order, the stock data also
includes data on any special stock or blocks.
As in the case with the quant, which contains exact information regarding the
last goods movement, object references are also updated in moved handling units.
The handling unit history (see Fig. 3.32) ensures the seamless transparency of
handling unit movements with the indication of the packing objects. These are
the respective documents of procurement, distribution or warehouse logistics to
which a handling unit has been allocated in the process.
As is the case with the handling unit history, the document ﬂow of a sales process
contains all documents generated with reference to a preceding document in a business
transaction. In a traditional shipping process, this document chain generally consists of
a source sales order and the delivery generated with reference to that order.
Handling unit history
Figure 3.32 shows the history of the handling unit with the external number
130005670000005702. This handling unit, a pallet, was used in the previous
examples for the shipping process. Figure 3.30 shows the storage unit for the
“to” storage location in Transfer Order 213. This transfer order, Outbound
Delivery 0080016882, and Goods Issue Document 49000004792011,
generated with reference to this handling unit, are updated as a packing object
in the handling unit history.
In a warehouse managed with WM where goods issue is executed with reference
to an outbound delivery, a transfer order and handling unit are subsequently

generated. The handling unit is noted in the document ﬂow with its internal number,
which differs from its external one. The delivery culminates in a goods issue,
documented in the system with the material document, which, in the document
ﬂow, is called a GD goods issue (see Fig. 3.33).
3.3.4.1
Goods Issue Without Reference to a Delivery
For a goods issue without reference to a delivery, the physical stock movement is
generally preceded by an accounting inventory posting of a goods issue (see
Fig. 3.20). In Inventory Management, the goods issue posting creates a negative
quant in the goods issue interim storage (interim storage type), and the system
automatically generates a transfer requirement.
Based on this transfer requirement, a transfer order is created for issue and the
storage bins from which the material is to be picked are determined. After
the materials have been moved in the warehouse and brought to interim storage,
the transfer order is conﬁrmed. By conﬁrming the stock movement, the negative
stock of the goods issue interim storage is cleared.
Internal stock movements for which no goods issues are performed can be
conducted directly by manually creating a transfer order. These types of movements
are generally stock transfers within a warehouse for which a transfer order is
created without a preceding document.
Typically, goods issue is the result of a previous stock removal. The stock
removal is controlled via a transfer order that contains the source as well as the
destination storage bin. Thus, the ﬁrst step in the stock removal procedure is the
search for a suitable source storage bin. Such a search is conducted via stock
removal control.
As in the case of stock placement control, each stock removal procedure
involves a search according to a predeﬁned sequence and strategy. This search,
triggered by a transfer order, is also inﬂuenced by the material to be removed and its
Fig. 3.33 Document ﬂow of the sales process
3.3
Warehouse Management with WM
149

characteristics. Especially important is whether or not a material is batch-managed
(for more information on batch management, see Volume 1, Chap. 3, “Organiza-
tional Structures and Master Data”).
The search for a storage type and area for removal is done according to a search
sequence stored in the system much like that of storage type and area determination
for stock placement control. Determination of the storage type is particularly based
on the storage type indicator, the special stock indicator and the stock category. The
stock category indicates whether the stock is unrestricted-use, return stock, blocked
stock or stock in quality inspection. The storage section is determined using a
preference list that has a certain sequence with which the system determines the
storage section. This search is performed for the determined storage type using the
storage type indicator for stock placement control and using the storage class.
Storage bin search
Figure 3.34 shows the log of a storage bin search for the transfer order used in
the previous example. The system ﬁrst determined the storage type and area
for Material LEHU-002 with the aid of Picking Type Indicator 120 and
Storage Section Indicator 001. Storage Bin 12-01-01 in Storage Type 120
was determined using the stock removal strategy FIFO.
The actual determination of a storage bin is done using a stock removal, or
picking, strategy stored in the system. WM selects the most suitable quant within a
Fig. 3.34 Log of storage bin search
150
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

storage type from a series of preconﬁgured strategies, depending on operational
needs. The following stock removal strategies are offered, which can be altered
through a user’s own extensions and logic:
•
FIFO and stringent FIFO: “First In, First Out”
With this stock removal strategy, WM suggests removal of the oldest quant for
each storage type determined in the storage type search. The age of the quant and
thus that of the materials stored in it are determined using the date of the inward
stock movement posting. For stringent FIFO, the system searches an entire
warehouse number, taking into account all storage types.
•
LIFO: “Last In, First Out”
This picking strategy suggests the most recently added quant for each storage type.
•
Partial quantities ﬁrst
The partial quantities strategy attempts to achieve an optimization of the ware-
house situation by trying to take the quantities required for a transfer order from
a complete storage unit, with the goal of producing as few partial units, or partial
pallet quantities, as possible.
•
According to quantity
For this removal strategy, selection of the storage type is inﬂuenced by the
required quantity. The control quantity is stored in the material master, and
causes a material to be taken from ﬁxed bin storage for small quantities and from
high rack storage for large quantities.
•
Shelf life expiration date
The expiration date or shelf life of a material is stored in the material master
record. WM tries to ﬁnd the material with the oldest expiration date. If the
expiration date has not been stored, the system uses the FIFO strategy.
•
Fixed bin
Using the ﬁxed bin strategy, the system determines the storage bin using the
ﬁxed bin stored in the material master. Since the storage bin found using this
picking strategy is also suggested even if negative stock exists, a replenishment
control should be set for ﬁxed bins.
The following section provides an overview of selected warehouse-internal and
cross-warehouse processes.
3.3.5
Warehouse-Internal Processes
Warehouse-internal processes not only include warehouse-wide procedures such as
picking, placing and internal goods movements, but also WM functions that are
available in all storage processes. The processes of hazardous material management
and warehouse automation will not be explored further in this book.
Every company is legally obligated to conduct an accounting balance of stock,
or the taking of inventory. By determining the physical inventory, the book inven-
tory balance stored in the system can be compared with the actual inventory.
Measuring, counting, weighing or estimating inventory can be done by Inventory
3.3
Warehouse Management with WM
151

or Warehouse Management. Because of its higher degree of precision when WM is
used, inventory is performed by Warehouse Management, by taking the inventory
of each quant in their respective storage bins. We will not detail the taking of
inventory within Inventory Management, as it would extend beyond the scope of
this book. If the inventory analysis results in a difference between the target and
actual values, this is noted in the physical inventory document and subsequently
posted in Inventory Management.
WM supports legally-accepted inventory processes, which can be set for each
storage type:
•
Periodic or annual inventory
For the periodic inventory method, the physical inventory of a company is
recorded on a key date (usually the end of a ﬁscal year).
•
Continuous inventory
This type of inventory is conducted throughout the entire ﬁscal year by recording
partial stocks at desired times. All materials are counted at least once per year,
and the book inventory balance is regularly compared with the actual stock. For
continuous inventory during putaway, inventory is conducted when stock is
initially placed into a storage bin. No further inventory is counted during the
ﬁscal year, because all goods movements at a particular storage bin have to be
veriﬁed by transfer orders, which, by law, must be archived.
•
Inventory sampling
In the current ﬁscal year, inventory is taken based on a random sample method
and recorded in the system. This sampling is done on a random part of the
material stock used to make projections.
•
Cycle counting
This type of inventory enables you to count materials in warehouse stock
repeatedly at speciﬁc intervals during the course of the ﬁscal year. The procedure
is based on a consumption- or requirement-based ABC analysis for the selection
of material stock that is to be considered. Materials whose value-based share of
total consumption or requirement amounts to a particular percentage stored in
the system are inventoried as low-value materials.
To take inventory in the system, the storage type to be inventoried is ﬁrst blocked
and a physical inventory document generated (see Fig. 3.35). The physical inven-
tory document includes the inventory process to be employed and the storage bins
to be checked. If no open transfer order items exist for those storage bins, the
physical inventory document is activated and the respective storage bins are locked
for goods movement.
In order to perform physical inventory on storage bins, the physical inventory
document is printed and forwarded to the responsible employees. Inventory is then
determined and manually recorded on the printout of the physical inventory
document.
After physical inventory is taken, the counting results are entered in WM. This
can be done manually, with the aid of scanners or, if an external system is employed,
through the automatic import of large amounts of data. Any discrepancies in the
152
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

inventory items and differences between actual, counted quantities and the book
inventory balance are entered in WM as inventory differences and serve as the basis
for an inventory adjustment. Adjustment in Warehouse Management is done with
the aid of the interim storage area (interim storage type), by generating a negative
quant for insufﬁcient quantities and a positive quant for positive differences. These
differences are subsequently posted from Warehouse Management to Inventory
Management. In the case of considerable deviations, a recount can be requested by
the having the system issue a new physical inventory document.
From the viewpoint of Inventory Management, a posting change is a change in
bookkeeping information of such data as stock type, special stock categorization or
the material or batch number. Stock transfers, on the other hand, are related to
physical goods movements in the warehouse. A posting change can lead to a stock
transfer.
Warehouse Management considers a posting change with regard to the storage
bins in which the respective material quantities are situated. The posting change,
representing a change in stock data, is usually done in Inventory Management.

If a posting change affects a certain plant/warehouse combination managed by
WM, it also affects Warehouse Management. In such a case, the system must be
informed as to where the altered material quantities are located and which storage
bin stock is affected.
Posting changes are normally not connected to a physical goods movement in
Warehouse Management. Because only stock attributes are changing, the material
stays in its storage bin. The posting change in Inventory Management triggers a
posting change notice, comparable to a transfer requirement, with a posting change
interim storage area (interim storage type). As is the case for an outbound delivery,
a negative quant is generated at the interim storage area representing the material
quantity to be reposted before the posting change process. At the same time, a
positive quant is created for the material quantity with the stock attributes it will
have after the posting change. The actual stock transfer is done via a transfer order
with reference to the posting change notice. There are two possibilities for this: You
can perform a posting change from plant to plant or between storage locations.
In the case of a posting change from plant to plant, stock is generally stored
within the same warehouse complex. When the ownership of stock is transferred
from one plant to another, the material stock usually physically remains in the same
storage bin.
For posting changes from one storage location to another, physical goods
movement typically occurs within or between warehouses. Especially if several
warehouse numbers are involved, such movement is considered an outbound or
inbound delivery from a warehouse management perspective. In such cases, the
transfer order contains the stock to be transferred from a single stock category and
the respective destination storage bin for physical goods movement.
In special cases, such as if the stock category and the special stock indicator are
changed, the posting change can also be initiated directly in Warehouse Manage-
ment. The system is set such that a stock posting automatically takes place
following a change in the stock category.
Stock transfers are physical goods movements from one storage bin to another.
Unlike posting changes, stock transfers always involve a change in the physical
location of a certain material quantity in the warehouse. From a warehouse manage-
ment point of view, a stock transfer can occur with or without a posting change.
A stock transfer from the perspective of inventory management is explained
above in Sect. 3.2.1, “Goods Movement”. Stock transfers as seen from the process
view, especially with regard to document-related processing as a stock transfer
order, were discussed in Volume 1, Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”.
Stock transfers with posting changes
In a posting change, the batch allocation of a certain material quantity is
changed. This stock attribute change makes it necessary to transfer those
material quantities to another storage bin.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

For stock transfers within a single warehouse number, SAP ERP supports users
by providing detailed information on the stock movements to be performed, as well
as managing and displaying these movements. In everyday business, such stock
movements often result from a consolidation of partial quantities from various
storage bins into one storage bin, such as through the provision of materials from
high rack storage to a picking area or from the transfer of material for technical
reasons, such as because a certain capacity limit has been reached. From the
perspective of inventory management, the total stock does not change based on
these internal stock movements. Stock movements are thus performed without the
use of Inventory Management. As in all stock movements, a stock transfer between
storage bins within a single warehouse number is done using a transfer order.
Stock transfers between storage locations generally begin in Stock Management
and are completed in Warehouse Management. When stock transfer is required
from one WM-managed storage location to a non-WM-managed location, it is
processed as a goods issue with stock removal by Warehouse Management. In the
opposite case, if a transfer is done from a non-WM-managed storage location to a
storage location with Warehouse Management, transfer is performed as a goods
issue with putaway. Stock transfers between two WM-managed storage locations
are initially conducted in Stock Management. From the perspective of Warehouse
Management, stock transfer is conducted in the usual way, with a transfer order
issued with reference to a material document or via a list with open transfer
requirements.
A special form of stock transfer is replenishment to reﬁll stock in ﬁxed storage
bins. In accordance with settings in the material master and the current stock
situation, the system calculates the stock to be maintained in the storage bins in
the function replenishment for ﬁxed storage bins. For replenishment planning for
ﬁxed storage bins, the system calculates the current stock situation as well as
planned removals due to deliveries that are to be picked from ﬁxed storage bins.
Actual ﬁlling of the storage bins can be performed based on a previous replenish-
ment plan by generating transfer requirements for the required replenishment
quantities. As usual, the transfer requirements are subsequently carried out with
transfer orders.
A further possibility to generate stock transfers required for replenishment is by
conﬁrming a transfer order for removal. In such a case, a transfer order can be
directly generated for replenishment without the prior need to generate a transfer
requirement.

Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
SAP Extended Warehouse Management is a decentralized warehouse management
system. Decoupled from SAP ERP, as an autonomous application of SAP Supply
Chain Management (SAP SCM), integration with an ERP system is generally
required for master and transactional data. The EWM release SAP SCM 2007
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
155

also provided the opportunity to centrally operate EWM from within SAP ECC 6.0
as an add-on and thus use it as an integrated warehouse management system with an
SAP ERP system (Fig. 3.36).
3.4.1
System Integration
From a purely technical standpoint, SAP EWM can also be operated as an autono-
mous system, without direct connection to SAP ERP or a non-SAP system. How-
ever, experience has shown that – depending on the project base of the interfaces to
be established and the processes to be implemented – standard integration with an
ERP system is preferred. In this chapter, for our illustrations and processes, we
assume that the EWM system is linked to an ERP system and close integration of
the existing standard interfaces is established. Figure 3.37 illustrates the technical
process connection of the SCM-based EWM systems to SAP ERP.
We have already discussed Inventory Management in SAP ERP in this chapter.
Warehouse and stock management are done in SAP EWM, and are the focus of this
section.

Warehouse Organization and Stock Movement
The acceptance of a warehouse management system is, among other things, based
on its seamless integration in an ERP system and on its ﬂexibility in mapping
logistics processes. SAP EWM was developed for complex warehouse and distri-
bution centers with a variety of products and a high document volume. That is why
the design of this new, decentralized warehouse management system has special
emphasis on the ﬂexible mapping of warehouse-internal processes. The extent of

functions has been expanded considerably in comparison to the existing WM and
supplemented by a number of warehouse structure elements.
In this section, we will provide a short introduction to ERP integration, followed
by an overview of warehouse organization and the special features connected to
stock movements in SAP EWM.
The technical linkage of EWM to ERP and such functions as the transfer of
inbound and outbound deliveries between the systems take place in real time via
deﬁned interfaces. These interfaces enable the seamless integration of both systems
by distributing, altering and returning data relevant to delivery.
Inbound and outbound processing is performed asynchronously, based on the
sequence stored in the inbound and outbound queues. In the event of an error, for
example caused by a missing network connection, this queue saves all transfers
and allows processing to continue seamlessly as soon as the error has been located
and eliminated. The queue enables the real-time and bidirectional exchange and
processing of information.
Figure 3.38 shows the technical integration of SAP ERP and SAP SCM. For the
transfer of master and transactional data, two different procedures are used: master
data distribution via CIF and communication and distribution of document data
with the aid of BAPIs:
•
The distribution of master data is done via the Core Interface (CIF). The master
data to be distributed is selected using an integration model in SAP ERP, and
actual distribution is done from ERP to SCM.
•
The communication and distribution of document data is done with the aid of
BAPIs (Business Application Programming Interfaces). These are interfaces that
are accessed with an RFC connection (Remote Function Call).

You can ﬁnd more information on the integration and distribution of master data
and the interface technology used in that process in Volume 1, Chap. 2, “Organiza-
tional structures and Master Data”.
From a technical standpoint, close integration of EWM and ERP is achieved via
interfaces, while process integration is primarily done via organizational data (see
Fig. 3.1). As in the case of integration of the WM system, in SAP EWM, organiza-
tional allocation of warehouse numbers is initially achieved by their allocation to
speciﬁc plant/storage location combinations. Stock management is always executed
in ERP, and all quantities of materials stored in an EWM warehouse are allocated
on the plant/storage location level. However, the assigned WM warehouse number
is identiﬁed in the system settings as a decentralized warehouse, and informs the
system that warehouse-logistics-related processing is to be conducted in a
decentralized warehouse management system, and the respective document is
replicated to the integrated EWM system. This ERP warehouse number is assigned
an EWM warehouse number in the EWM system settings.
Allocation of a decentralized warehouse
From the viewpoint of SAP ERP, decentralized warehouse management,
speciﬁcally the integration of an EWM system, is executed through the
allocation of a WM warehouse number to a speciﬁc plant/storage location
combination. The WM warehouse number in this case is identiﬁed in the ERP
system settings as a decentralized warehouse number and represents a type of
“interim storage number” for the technical system integration of SAP EWM.
Based on this procedure, both a decentralized connection to an EWM system
as well as central warehouse management with WM can be achieved simul-
taneously for a single plant, depending on the warehouse locations deter-
mined for a speciﬁc material. This ﬂexibility allows the separation and
selection of the warehouse management system on the material level. The
interim storage number is used exclusively for integration purposes and has
no further logical signiﬁcance in ERP.
The structure of a warehouse is typically based on the goods and their required
space, and according to any existing automation technology and requirements. As
in the case with WM, SAP EWM also offers several possibilities to map an
individual warehouse structure according to its operational requirements. This
organization data also plays an important role in the control of processes (see
Fig. 3.40).
Comparable to WM, the warehouse number in EWM also represents a physical
warehouse or complete warehouse complex in which stock is stored. Even though
the two systems are not related, the warehouse number in EWM also summarizes
the individual physical areas of a warehouse complex in a logical manner, and with
its four digits, it represents the highest organizational level.
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM

The storage types generally serve to categorize the physical sections in a
warehouse according to technical, spatial and organizational aspects. Based on
spatial circumstances and physical characteristics of the storage equipment used,
block storage, open storage and high rack storage are deﬁned by a company’s own
physical storage types. In addition, the use of a certain storage type can be changed
in the system settings of SAP EWM with the aid of a role code. This code indicates
whether a storage type is a “regular storage type” based on the previous deﬁnition or
a spatial area for the identiﬁcation, provision, removal or inspection of materials.
A yard, meaning the parking area assigned to a warehouse, is also a storage type to
which the respective “yard role” has been allocated.
Within a certain storage type, storage sections combine all storage bins having
certain homogenous characteristics. Such characteristics can relate to materials
stored in the bins. The respective criteria are user-deﬁned, and serve as an organi-
zational aid and control and optimization parameters for storage. Examples of
storage sections include certain zones within a storage type (racks) with regard to
inventory turnover and the composition of a material (see Fig. 3.40).
Storage section
A storage section exists in a warehouse for high rack storage. Based on the
inventory turnover of the materials stored there, two storage sections are
deﬁned. Materials with a low turnover frequency, or slow-moving items, are
stored in a rear storage section. To minimize travel times during material
removal, the fast-moving items are stored near the aisle in the front section of
the rack.
Storage bins represent master data and signify the physical locations, that is, the
bins with their speciﬁc coordinates (see Fig. 3.39). In addition to the speciﬁc
allocation of a storage type and section, storage bin master data includes precise
information on the storage bin type, volume and maximum weight that can be
stored in that bin. The storage bin type is particularly used in the determination of
the putaway strategy and the search for a suitable storage bin, and determines the
type of pallet that can be stored in that storage bin.
Storage bin
Figure 3.39 shows the storage bin master data for Storage Bin 01-01-A in
Storage Type 0050 (ﬁxed bin storage). Based on the allocation of Storage Bin
Type P002, the storage bin is set up for pallets having a height up of to 2 m. In
addition to general master data, the storage bin data also includes information
on the current stock situated in that storage bin, as well as on the most recent
stock movements.
160

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

The current stock of a certain material quantity having the same characteristics is
mapped using quants. We have already discussed quants in Sect. 3.3.1, “Warehouse
Structure and Integration”, with regard to WM. They aid in the transactional
management of stock on the lowest storage bin level. Quants are created in an
EWM system in the same way as in WM, through the putaway of material in a
storage bin. Picking and stock transfers cause the stock, and thus the quant, to be
updated and automatically deleted by the system if stock is no longer situated in that
particular storage bin.
Activity areas are a special feature in SAP EWM and represent a logical
grouping of storage bins with regard to the warehouse activities to be performed,
such as putaway, inventory-taking and picking. Activity areas serve the optimiza-
tion of warehouse activities. To do so, the storage bins for which an activity is to be
executed are sorted according to the criteria stored in the system before the system
generates warehouse tasks along the lines of the warehouse task creation rules.
Creating warehouse tasks to perform warehouse activities – a further special feature
of SAP EWM – is explained in the following section.
Doors are allocated to a speciﬁc warehouse number and describe the physical
location where transport units and their vehicles are loaded and unloaded and
materials arrive at or leave the warehouse. From a system viewpoint, a door is a
storage bin to which a certain storage type with the storage role “door” is assigned
and for which a speciﬁc loading direction has been determined. The loading
direction determines whether a door is only to be used for goods receipts or
goods issues or both movement directions. In operative practice, these doors are
in the vicinity of the staging areas in which putaway and picking processes are
controlled.
Fig. 3.39 Storage bin master data
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM

Staging areas, in their function as interim storage areas, control inbound and
outbound delivery processes. From the system view, staging areas represent a
special storage type (storage type role) that has been assigned a warehouse number
and at least one door. From the viewpoint of goods receipt, staging areas are used to
temporarily store unloaded materials to be put away. For goods issue, they serve as
interim storage of material quantities already picked and waiting for loading.
A work center is a physical location in a warehouse where certain warehouse
activities can be carried out and to which a material quantity can be moved for that
purpose. Such activities include:
•
Deconsolidation
•
Packing
•
Counting
•
Quality inspection
Depending on the activity to be performed, the work center layout determines
which tab is shown in the respective system work center (see Figs. 3.54, 3.56, 3.68).
From a technical standpoint, a work center is also a storage type with an allocated
storage bin and corresponding settings for the required storage sections. This
ﬂexibility enables you to customize a work center, especially for deconsolidation
or quality inspection, and assign inbound and outbound sections.
Organizational structures in EWM
Figure 3.40 shows Warehouse Number 1000. Goods receipt takes place at
Door A, and goods issues via Door B. Storage Type A refers to the goods
receipt staging area in which materials are kept after unloading until their
ﬁnal putaway in Storage Type D or E. Mixed pallets are deconsolidated at a
work center (Storage Type C) before putaway. Certain storage bins (P) in the
rack storage (Storage Type D) and in the high rack storage (Storage Type E)
have been grouped into a single activity area. To optimize warehouse pro-
cesses, the high rack storage (Storage Type D) has been split into two storage
sections. The storage section for fast-moving goods is close to the goods issue
staging area.
In addition to the organizational units mentioned for warehouse structuring, SAP
EWM uses other master data to automate and thus optimize procedures in the
warehouse. The most signiﬁcant master data and its use are detailed below.
The tasks to be performed in a warehouse are processed automatically using
warehouse automation technology or manually by warehouse employees. Ware-
house employees and their equipment (pallet trucks, forklifts, etc.) are mapped in
the system as resources. Every resource belongs to a speciﬁc resource type and is
clearly allocated to a resource group.
The resource type groups resources with similar technical or physical qualities,
such as their horizontal speed, qualiﬁcation and preferences. The resource type
162
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

allocated to an employee with its assigned bin access type determines such issues as
whether that particular resource (in this case, a person) is only allowed access to
certain stock situated in a particular section of the warehouse, or that only handling
units of a certain size (handling unit type) may be moved.
The resource group determines the sequence in which warehouse tasks are
selected for the corresponding resource. To execute and accept warehouse tasks,
the resource can log in to a radio frequency environment (RF environment).
Because SAP EWM is an SCM component, the material master data is
distributed from ERP to SCM via the APO Core Interface (described in Volume 1,
Chap. 2, “Organizational Structures and Master Data”). A warehouse product is the
warehouse-number view of the material master, and contains EWM-speciﬁc
parameters only applicable to a speciﬁc warehouse and a speciﬁcally authorized
employee. Such data includes information on the control of picking and putaway,
parameters governing the determination of a storage section and the characteristics
of storage bins in which a product can or must be placed (see Fig. 3.41). The
relevance of these parameters is described in more detail in reference to storage
control.
The general procedures for serialization and batch management are detailed in
Volume 1, Chap. 3, “Organizational Structures and Master Data”. Both functions
are also available in SAP EWM.
Serial numbers are a series of characters used in addition to a material number to
allow differentiation between an individual item and other materials with the same
material number. In particular, companies that supply customers with high-priced

items often want to give each product a speciﬁc number for easy identiﬁcation, such
as for warranty and guarantee reasons. EWM offers the opportunity to give each
item a 30-digit serial number in addition to the product number. These serial
numbers are managed by proﬁles, which are assigned to products and can control
such questions as whether entering a serial number at goods receipt is obligatory or
optional. In addition, the assignment of serial numbers can also be location-depen-
dent: It is possible to issue serial numbers only to a product located at a speciﬁc site,
or to make the assignment of a serial number obligatory at only one site.
Batches have become very important to many industries, and regulations some-
times require their use. Companies in the food and animal feed industries, as well as
chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are especially subject to laws requiring
the traceability of critical components or ingredients in all production, processing
and distribution stages and to establish a suitable crisis management program.
Based on the complexity of batch characteristics or shelf-life issues – such as in
the food industry – many companies need comprehensive batch management. SAP
EWM includes the complete integration of batch management. In all processes,
such as goods receipt or picking, batches or their characteristics can be taken into
Fig. 3.41 Warehouse product with EWM-speciﬁc parameters
164
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

account. EWM can process batch speciﬁcations from the ERP system, but also can
determine batches itself, based on the corresponding batch search strategy.
Dangerous goods in logistics require special storage circumstances for legal
reasons alone. It is especially important for a warehouse management system to
monitor processes surrounding the safe handling of hazardous material and support
employees in observing legal and operational speciﬁcations. With its component
SAP Environment, Health, and Safety Management (SAP EHS Management),
SAP EWM can enable safe handling, storage, and the secure transport of dangerous
goods.
The EHS functions supplied by EWM include phrase management, with which
text modules in various languages can be managed to save information on danger-
ous goods and issue it on dangerous goods documents. EWM allows you to save
information pertaining to a hazardous substance in the dangerous goods master
record, such as data required for a dangerous goods check. In addition, EWM
provides a function with which you can print a list of dangerous goods for the ﬁre
department, including all pertinent information.
A packaging speciﬁcation provides information on all packaging requirements
for materials to be put away or transported, and contains information on each
material regarding the packaging materials required, as well as what steps are
involved in the packaging process. The packaged content refers to the material to
be packaged or another packaging speciﬁcation. Generally, this information is used
for the automated palleting of materials, and controls which storage bins are
possible for putaway at the time of goods receipt. Packaging speciﬁcations are
also supported by the following processes and work steps:
•
Packaging at work centers
•
Packaging during conﬁrmation of warehouse tasks
•
Packaging and deconsolidation using the RF Framework
Determining what packaging speciﬁcation to use is done automatically on the
basis of SAP consolidation technology. The option of deﬁning your own conditions,
characteristics and circumstances and using them as a condition record in the
system lets you determine packaging speciﬁcations and tailor them to operational
needs.
Packaging speciﬁcations can be structured hierarchically and enable you to map
complex packaging procedures: The packages are organized in a hierarchy and
must be packaged according to instructions saved for the respective packaging level
(see Fig. 3.42). Packaging speciﬁcations can be printed out to serve as instructions
for employees in the warehouse for such tasks as how to afﬁx labels or stack
products on pallets.
Means of transport such as trucks are mapped in EWM as vehicles. Vehicles are
used to group deliveries and are loaded and unloaded at warehouse doors. These
procedures lead to a change in status of the allocated delivery document, and enable
integration with transportation management, for instance, to generate bills of
lading. Means of transport can be further speciﬁed with transportation units, the
actual load carriers. A transportation unit is the smallest loadable unit of a vehicle,
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
165

and is either ﬁxed to that vehicle or represents a uniﬁed structure with it. Thus, a
truck with a cargo area and an additional trailer consists of the vehicle itself with its
own loading capacity (the vehicle and the transportation unit) and a trailer that is
mapped in the system as a further transportation unit.
Transportation units are units consisting of a load carrier and packaged goods,
and are mapped in the EWM as handling units. The actual transportation unit is
stored in the system as a packaging material, as is the case with handling units. This
allocation to packaging materials allows for ﬂexible construction of a vehicle in
which you can determine how many transportation units a vehicle should have and
in what order they are to be allocated. Movements of vehicles and transportation
units outside the warehouse are done via Yard Management. Transportation units
that are situated in the yard aid in the inventory management of the materials
contained in them. Yard Management as a cross-warehouse function is explained
in more detail below.
In WM, stock movements are triggered by transfer orders that are either
generated with reference to sales and distribution logistics delivery documents, or
based on transfer requirements (see Fig. 3.20). In EWM, warehouse tasks (picking,
removal and placement, transfer postings and stock transfers, as well as the
scrapping of material) are triggered by warehouse requests. A warehouse request
is a work list for purposes of placing, moving or picking the “requested” materials.
In WM, the transfer order contains information on the material to be moved –
speciﬁcally, from what location (source storage bin) to what new location (destina-
tion storage bin). Then, that stock movement is conﬁrmed by the warehouse
employee. In EWM, a warehouse request is generated from a preceding document.

Such preceding documents are usually inbound delivery notiﬁcations (see
Fig. 3.48), transfer posting notiﬁcations and outbound delivery notiﬁcations (see
Fig. 3.61) that have been replicated from WM to EWM. The generation of ware-
house requests for these preceding documents is done automatically, and the
generated warehouse requests are enhanced with EWM data.
Warehouse requests are the basis for the creation of warehouse tasks, which in
turn fulﬁll those requests.
A warehouse task contains all necessary information to move a certain material
quantity or handling unit in the warehouse, and simultaneously serves to document
the actual stock movements achieved. All necessary data is stored in the warehouse
task for physical internal transport to, from or within a warehouse, from one storage
bin to another. These stock movements are based on logical or physical goods
movements. Depending on the type of unit moved, we differentiate between
product and HU warehouse tasks (see Fig. 3.43).
A product warehouse task is a warehouse task based on a physical goods
movement or stock change. The number of items in a product warehouse task
depends on the stock movement to be executed. In addition to an indication of the
material to be moved, the product warehouse tasks include the quantity to be moved
and the source and destination storage bins. With regard to the runtime, the
corresponding material quantity is reserved in the system.
When a product warehouse task is conﬁrmed, the EWM is informed that the
material quantities in question have reached their destination. For manual conﬁr-
mation, the destination storage bin, or target location, can be changed. For a goods
receipt or issue posting, the product warehouse tasks consists of an item whose
conﬁrmation increases or decreases stock. Transfer postings are made up of two
items: one with the source storage bin whose stock is reduced, and one with the
destination storage bin whose stock is increased. In the case of a partial

conﬁrmation, an item is generated for every partial quantity. In this way, difference
quantities can be recorded and justiﬁed with an exception code.
Unlike product warehouse tasks, in which material quantities are moved, HU
warehouse tasks are for the internal transport of packages. These packages, HUs,
are generally pallets that are moved within a warehouse from one storage bin to
another or for loading and unloading of a transportation unit. The warehouse task
contains the source and destination storage bins, as well as precise information on
the HU to be moved. In contrast to product warehouse tasks, this precise informa-
tion makes a quantity reservation unnecessary, because the HU is speciﬁcally
known to the system.
Handling unit and product warehouse tasks
Figure 3.43 shows a simple goods receipt process. A transportation unit parks
at Door A and contains two pallets that are unloaded via an HU warehouse
task. The source storage bin corresponds to the warehouse door, while the
destination storage bin represents the goods receipt area. One pallet contains
two different products with varying storage requirements. This HU is moved
from the goods receipt area to a work center and subsequently opened. The
actual deconsolidation step is also executed via a warehouse task. As the
result of the deconsolidation, the pallet is divided into two product quantities
that are then placed into rack storage. The placing of these products is done
using product warehouse tasks.
Both product and handling unit warehouse tasks can be created with reference to
a warehouse request, and for internal stock movements, without a reference docu-
ment as well, and they let you achieve multi-level, internal warehouse processes.
The actual generation of these tasks is done automatically via a PPF (post-
processing framework), manually via a user interface or through waves (wave
management). Wave management generates not only warehouse tasks, but also
groups them into warehouse orders.
Warehouse orders are executable work packages for warehouse employees that
are generated according to the warehouse order generation rules stored in the
system. The warehouse order contains the warehouse tasks or inventory items to
be executed.
Warehouse orders can be created manually or automatically by the system.
Automatic generation of warehouse orders allows optimal control of the material
ﬂow in the warehouse. Control is performed with the aid of waves. Making waves
has the advantage that warehouse tasks can ﬁrst be collected and released together
at a later time. This allows them to be more effectively grouped into work packages
for warehouse employees, which has a positive effect on travel times, and poten-
tially the picking and base times as well. In addition, the material ﬂow can be
optimized, for instance by initially not undertaking replenishments after picking.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Wave Management groups a certain kind of warehouse request into a wave.
Regardless of the point in time in which a wave is to be released, that is, the point in
which warehouse tasks can be processed, wave management generates the neces-
sary work packages in the form of warehouse orders and their corresponding
warehouse tasks. The criteria for wave management can be kept in wave templates.
At the time of the warehouse task generation, EWM uses putaway strategies to
determine the storage bin for putaway or, using a picking strategy, the stock for
material removal. You can also determine the time that is needed to execute a stock
movement. This time span depends on the material, the quantity to be moved and
the geographical distance of a particular stock movement. During the warehouse
task generation process, these target times are added together and, if necessary,
supplemented by a deﬁned setup time. If EWM Resource Management is used,
travel time is also taken into account.
Wave generation and release to create warehouse tasks are typically done
automatically. In order to automatically allocate warehouse tasks to waves, criteria
from the delivery can be utilized. Due to the automated processing, this ﬂexibility
enables optimized grouping of the outgoing deliveries and an optimization of
picking by drastically reducing picking times.
The processes in a warehouse, stock movements and the process steps to be
performed depend on the individual operational needs and on spatial circumstances
in the warehouse. In practical situations, it is thus rare that the material ﬂow is the
same within a warehouse for all products and in all areas. Several people and
resources are involved in the warehouse processes. Pallets might need to be
deconsolidated in the goods receipt area or consolidated in the goods issue area.
For ﬂexible, tailor-made control of the material ﬂow across several stations, and in
order to enable cross-resource stock movement through various stations, EWM
offers a storage control.
The purpose of storage control is to map complex, multiple-level stock
movements for putaway and removal and for internal warehouse transfer. Storage
control is done with relation to the spatial circumstances along the lines of the
predominant warehouse processes and the stock to be moved. Using storage
control, EQM can specify the putaway or removal route across several stations in
a process- or layout-oriented manner. This allows processes such as counting or
deconsolidation in the goods receipt area or packing in the goods issue area to be
performed in an automated fashion. Storage control can be executed on multiple
levels, enabling material ﬂow via several interim storage bins.
Stock movements are controlled via storage processes. Each process and all
process steps in goods receipt and issue are allocated to a storage process. The
possible goods movement types and the direction of movement are assigned to a
storage process via a warehouse process type and an activity. In EWM, the
warehouse process types include the following:
•
Putaway
•
Removal
•
Goods receipt posting
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
169

•
Goods issue posting
•
Inventory
•
Posting change
•
Cross-line placement
The determination of the storage process depends especially on product and
document information (see Figs. 3.53, 3.65). The storage process is automatically
selected by the system when the warehouse request is created, based on the
document type, the product and the delivery priority. By using document
characteristics and control indicators in the product master, the storage process
can be controlled with great ﬂexibility. For simple goods movements, the storage
process itself can contain the storage type and bin from or to which a material is to
be moved. For complex movements, it can contain the storage process or process-
oriented storage control, or a storage creation rule.
Process-oriented storage control allows you to map complex picking and
putaway processes. The individual steps, such as unloading, quality inspection,
the execution of supplementary logistics services and subsequent putaway, can be
adjusted as desired and are allocated to a storage process in the system. The
determined procedures and their activities are assumed by the handling unit to be
picked or placed. The HU thus possesses the information regarding which process
steps are necessary for putaway, picking or warehouse-internal stock movements.
That is why process-oriented storage control only works with HUs.
Figure 3.44 shows the multi-level picking and putaway processes. Depending on
which storage process has been selected by the system, materials can be brought

directly from the goods receipt area to their storage bin in a single step. The
destination location can be altered manually.
Process-oriented control also allows multi-step processes in which, for example,
pallets with certain materials are weighed or isolated before putaway. To do this,
the system generates warehouse tasks from the source location to an interim storage
type. These interim locations are either work centers in which speciﬁc activities are
to be performed or areas in the warehouse in which stock must be temporarily
stored. Depending on the system settings, a speciﬁc destination storage location can
be determined at the beginning of the putaway process or at a subsequent time.
In goods issue, the multi-step process can include the creation of kits, a process
known as kitting, as well as a variety of packaging or consolidation steps before the
goods are staged in the goods issue area for loading.
Layout-oriented storage control is used when stock movements cannot take
place directly from a source to a speciﬁc destination or interim location because
of spatial circumstances. Such circumstances are commonly related to the layout of
the warehouse or the conveyor technology used. In the case of layout-oriented
control, SAP EWM automatically deactivates the original warehouse task and
generates the necessary intermediate steps.
Layout-oriented storage control
A pallet is to be brought from the goods receipt area to a work center. The
system generates a warehouse task for this purpose. The warehouse is
equipped with a conveyor system that moves pallets from a transfer point
directly to a work center. This spatial circumstance is taken into account in
storage control. The system deactivates the original warehouse task and
automatically generates an intermediate step in the form of a warehouse
task from the goods receipt area to the transfer point.
Process-oriented storage control can be combined with layout-oriented control.
For this, the system ﬁrst executes process-oriented control and then checks to see if
the determined process steps are also possible from the layout view. The necessary
intermediate steps are automatically generated by the system.
3.4.2.1
Warehouse Monitoring
Process control in SAP EWM is done with the aid of warehouse tasks. With the
warehouse management monitor, EWM offers warehouse employees a tool with
which they can be constantly updated on the current situation in the warehouse and
react accordingly (see Fig. 3.45). All activities and documents are displayed on the
monitor, from deliveries to the stock situation and warehouse tasks, to the efﬁciency
of individual employees.
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
171

Warehouse management monitor
Figure 3.45 shows the warehouse management monitor in EWM. The screen
is divided into three sections. On the left side, there is a hierarchy list with
predeﬁned nodes depending on desired work area. The work area, documents
to be selected, processes or messages can be found using the selection criteria.
The upper-right area contains the superordinate data, while the lower area has
the subordinate detail information on the selection. In this example, an
inbound delivery has been selected. The screen shows a number of inbound
deliveries. The subordinate detail information for the selected delivery docu-
ment indicates putaway as the corresponding warehouse activity status. A
further example of the warehouse management monitor is shown in Fig. 3.72.
The warehouse management monitor, or Warehouse Monitor, is not only a
display instrument, but also offers the possibility of actively inﬂuencing processes.
For instance, you can quickly react to unplanned events, such as by blocking
storage bins or allocating warehouse tasks to resources. The warehouse manage-
ment monitor also possesses functions for alert monitoring that highlight current
and potential problematic situations for the warehouse manager and provide tools to
handle exceptions. The monitor can be tailored to speciﬁc needs and expanded.
With the graphical warehouse layout GWL, available in EWM releases from
Version 7.0 on, you can depict the structure of your warehouse in two-dimensional
form (see Fig. 3.46).
Any master data errors within the warehouse structure can be rapidly identiﬁed
and corrected using this function. Graphical depiction is based on the storage bin
coordinates in the storage bin master data. In addition to storage bins, the GWL can
display other structures, such as walls or ofﬁces, as well as process-relevant objects
like handling units, forklifts, conveyor lines and rack feeders. Thus, the GWL
Fig. 3.45 Warehouse management monitor with warehouse task for putaway
172
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

enables you to visually monitor processes as well as inﬂuence them. In step with the
framework concept of EWM, the design and functions of the GWL can be tailored
and expanded according to your speciﬁc needs.
As an enhancement to the primarily text-based warehouse management
monitors, the Easy Graphics Framework (EGF) offers the opportunity to display
data in a Warehouse Cockpit (see Fig. 3.47).
With the aid of various chart types, you can monitor such things as resource
capacity or the status of certain system messages. You can adjust the layout and
displayed information to ﬁt your needs.
3.4.3
Goods Receipt
Goods receipt is one of the core processes in the warehouse, and it represents a
signiﬁcant interface between external and internal logistics. It is used for the
controlled establishment of stock and can be developed in a variety of ways,
based on spatial circumstances, the materials and quantities to be stored, volumes
and weights, as well as on the related information ﬂow from warehouse to
warehouse.
In this regard, EWM offers various design possibilities and enables a ﬂexible
integration of front- and back-end process steps into the overall process (see
Fig. 3.48). For example, you can integrate front-end transportation, yard or
unloading processes as well as back-end deconsolidation, packaging, counting
and checking processes into the process chain in physical goods receipt. The
Fig. 3.46 Graphical warehouse layout
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
173

following section uses a process example to illustrate the basic functions and steps
in inbound goods deliveries.
3.4.3.1
Goods Receipts Documents
The inbound delivery is the central document in goods receipt. It contains all data
relevant to the delivery and corresponds closely with the ERP system.
An inbound delivery is generated in the ERP system with reference to a purchase
order or the receipt of a shipping notiﬁcation from the vendor (see Fig. 3.49).
In addition, an inbound delivery can be created based on a customer return or as
the result of a production process in which ﬁnished products must be stored.
Shipping notiﬁcation in ERP
Figure 3.49 shows Inbound Delivery 180000183, generated in the ERP
system with reference to an order. The warehouse number EW1 is set in the
system as a decentralized warehouse, and is linked to EWM warehouse
number EWM1 in the EWM system. The goods receipt for this shipping
notiﬁcation is thus done in a decentralized EWM system. The document has
been distributed accordingly and generates an inbound delivery notiﬁcation.
Based on a certain combination of plant and storage bin and the allocated WM
warehouse number, the system determines for every item of the delivery whether
the goods receipt warehouse is decentralized or not (see Fig. 3.1). If at least one
item of that delivery is relevant to processing in EWM, the inbound delivery
document is replicated in the decentralized warehouse system (EWM), where it
generates an inbound delivery notiﬁcation (see Fig. 3.50).
The inbound delivery notiﬁcation generally includes the same information and
has the same structure as the delivery document in SAP ERP, and is activated upon
successful replication. Activating the inbound delivery notiﬁcation immediately
creates a delivery and a warehouse request, which triggers the goods receipt
processes in EWM.
Fig. 3.47 Graphical Warehouse Cockpit
174

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Inbound delivery notiﬁcation
Figure 3.50 shows Inbound Delivery Notiﬁcation 180000183 with regard to
ERP Delivery 180000183 (see Fig. 3.49). The document has been success-
fully replicated and activated, and has the same document number as the
document in ERP. Upon activation, SAP EWM automatically generates an
inbound delivery.
To initiate the goods receipt process, the ERP system generally creates an
inbound delivery from a shipping notiﬁcation. In practice, however, it is possible
that a goods receipt may have to be performed spontaneously without a shipping
notiﬁcation having been received. This process can be mapped in EWM as an
expected goods receipt (see Fig. 3.51).
The purchasing document from WM or a production order generates an expected
goods receipt in EWM. First, a notiﬁcation regarding the expected goods receipt is
created, consisting of a copy of all relevant logistics data from the replicated
preceding document. After it is activated, EWM automatically generates the

expected goods receipt. The subsequently arriving deliveries are generated without
a previous shipping notiﬁcation upon arrival of the delivery truck and veriﬁed by
comparing them to the expected goods receipt. Tolerance checks are performed on
the delivered materials. The inbound delivery also serves to trigger goods receipt
processing for expected goods receipts. The preceding documents are no longer
required and are regularly deleted.
From an operational standpoint, expected goods receipts have the advantage
that the goods receipt can take place in the warehouse without a prior shipping

notiﬁcation. In addition, from a warehouse management perspective, expected
goods receipts are used to assess the workload, and future goods receipts can be
planned based on the number of earmarked shipping notiﬁcations and order items.
To process expected goods receipts and forecast workload, SAP EWM offers
comprehensive transaction and evaluation options.
3.4.3.1
Controlling Putaway
The inbound delivery represents a warehouse request and the starting point for
subsequent activities in EWM (see Fig. 3.52). In addition to the data taken from the
preceding document, the inbound delivery contains all necessary information to
trigger and monitor the goods delivery process in EWM. This process typically
begins with processing a transport unit and unloading a delivery, and ends with
putaway of the materials in the warehouse. After the warehouse process type and
storage bin have been determined for putaway, EWM generates the warehouse
tasks necessary for the putaway process based on the process- or layout-oriented
storage control.

Inbound delivery in EWM
Figure 3.52 shows Inbound Delivery 112. The inbound delivery is the follow-
on document of Inbound Delivery Notiﬁcation 180000183. It represents a
warehouse request for the putaway of externally procured materials and on
the item level receives a seamless reference to the preceding documents. For
this delivery, Warehouse Process Type 1010 (putaway) was found. On the
item level, the source and destination storage bins are known. The inbound
delivery item is to be moved from the goods receipt area (GR-Zone) into
Storage Bin 01-01-A in Area 0001 of Storage Type 0020.
The warehouse process type is determined by EWM when the inbound delivery
is generated. The source storage bin and storage type are established using the
determined warehouse process type. The destination storage bin for putaway is
found according to the chart shown in Fig. 3.53.
Fig. 3.52 Inbound delivery as a warehouse request in EWM
178

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

In the ﬁrst step, EWM uses the storage type search sequence to determine the
storage type of the destination storage bin for every delivered item. The search is
done using document and product data. The sequence of a storage type search
contains all storage types that can be searched for storage bins. As soon as a storage
section is found for a speciﬁc combination of storage type and product attributes,
such as a hazardous material designation, EWM attempts to determine the actual
storage bin. The system follows the sequence and tries to determine the storage
sections for the ﬁrst storage type found. The search can also be inﬂuenced by so-
called weighting factors. These factors change the sequence of storage types and
storage sections in the putaway search sequence and enable such actions as the
preference of certain storage sections.
Actual determination of the storage bin is based on the storage section indicator
of the storage bin type in the product master and with reference to the putaway rule
or strategy and the capacity of the storage bin. If during the search of all storage bins
no free bin is found in the currently determined storage section, the system checks
the other storage sections. If bins are also not found in these sections, the check is
done for the next storage type in the storage type search sequence.
The putaway strategy serves to ﬁnd suitable storage bins for putaway. For this, it
accesses parameters in the product master, attempting to utilize storage capacity
as advantageously as possible. In addition to automatic determination, EWM
also allows you to manually edit certain goods movements and change source
and destination storage bins, normally automatically determined. When products
are put away, you can generally choose between various strategies, which are
conﬁgured in the system or supplemented with internal program logistics with the
aid of a business add-in (BadI). The following standard strategies, in addition to
manual entry, are available:

Additional information on putaway strategies
These putaway strategies exist in similar form for WM and were explained
brieﬂy above with reference to WM putaway strategies. Thus, we refer to that
explanation, as it also illuminates the operational view of putaway strategies
in EWM.
3.4.3.1
Unloading
After the inbound delivery has been generated and the storage process type deter-
mined, the vehicles and transport units are unloaded. During unloading, the goods
are moved out of the transport unit from the door to a staging zone, consolidation
zone or a work center for quality inspection, depending on operational needs. When
EWM Yard Management is used, the unloading process begins with the recording
of the vehicle or transport unit at the control point. Actual unloading can be done in
a simple or complex manner.
•
Simple unloading
For unloading of this type of delivery, only one status is set. The delivery to be
unloaded can be determined using an unloading transaction. After unloading, the
goods are ready for ﬁnal putaway in the goods receipt area.
•
Complex unloading
The putaway of HUs can also be done in a complex manner with the aid of a
warehouse task. The warehouse task cites the door as the source storage bin and,
depending on system settings, automatically determines the deconsolidation
zone as the destination storage bin. Goods receipt can be posted at various
times and, for complex unloading, is done at the latest when the unloading
warehouse task is conﬁrmed.
3.4.3.2
Deconsolidation
During putaway, the unloaded HU can contain various products. These products
may have to be put away in a variety of ways on in different sections. Distribution
of the delivered handling units in several putaway HUs is called deconsolidation.
From the putaway control view, deconsolidation – the intermediate step in the
distribution of the delivered HU – is done using an interim storage type. This is
180
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

typically a physical work center, or consolidation work center, in which the HU is
deconsolidated (see Fig. 3.54). The display of the consolidation work center shows
the employee the work list of the HUs to be processed. The warehouse employee
can allocate the HU contents to be put away via Drag & Drop to putaway HUs and
generate the subsequent warehouse tasks.
Whether or not deconsolidation is necessary – or whether a deconsolidation HU
is to be distributed among several putaway HUs (Fig. 3.55) – depends on the
consolidation group, which controls whether deconsolidation must take place for
an HU. Within the context of putaway control, the system determines the putaway
strategy and then the putaway bin for each material. The storage bin can be
allocated to an activity area. The consolidation group is determined from the
activity area, which is allocated to a particular storage bin. Based on this logic,
deconsolidation is always required, for example, when storage bins are determined
for products within that HU which are allocated to different activity areas.
Deconsolidation
Figure 3.55 shows the basic deconsolidation process. In this example, storage
bins for the putaway of the content of HU1 are determined. Both storage bins
are allocated to two different activity areas. That is why deconsolidation
is necessary. HU1 is moved to a deconsolidation work center for decon-
solidation. During deconsolidation, EWM generates a warehouse task per HU
item that takes consolidation into account. HU2 and HU3 are then put away or
processed further in accordance with a process-oriented control.
Fig. 3.54 Deconsolidation at a work center
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
181

After deconsolidation, it may be necessary to perform a quality inspection or
count of the materials to be put away. Generally, warehouse employees in goods
receipt perform the inspection and, depending on the result, decide on the further
placement of the materials.
With its Quality Inspection Engine (QIE), SAP EWM gives you the option of
integrating inspection processes into the process chain and control subsequent
activities. QIE supports quality management processes in a heterogeneous system
environment and is a further development of the functions of the previous Quality
Management (QM) in ERP. In this development, performance ﬂexibility of the
quality management function has been increased, as has the number of processes
that can be integrated into a quality inspection.
The quality inspection can be done in EWM at the time of goods receipt on
various levels, such as on the level of the complete delivery, the delivered HU or
product-based. The goods receipt process also completes the inbound delivery of
customer returns. Inspections can be performed several times for a goods receipt.
Depending on process requirements, a general sight check can be conducted upon
arrival of a vehicle, for example within the context of a preliminary inspection. An
additional inspection is then conducted after unloading on the level of the delivered
HUs (see Fig. 3.56).
In addition to the inspection at goods receipt, a quality inspection in the
warehouse can also be triggered manually at any time, such as if goods have been
damaged.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

The actual inspection is initiated through the creation of an inspection document.
Automatic generation of this document is based on the objects to be checked, or the
inspection object types, and the applicable inspection rules.
The inspection object type deﬁnes the software component, process and object
for which an inspection document is to be generated. Examples include the
counting inspection of a complete inbound delivery, the quality inspection of
individual received products or batches, or the inspection of products already
situated in the warehouse.
The inspection rules are assigned to the inspection object types and basically
contain the parameters specifying the extent and process of an inspection. They
include the inspection procedure, guidelines for generating the inspection docu-
ment, the method of determining the extent of an inspection, whether it is a random
sample and the code for the actual inspection decision. Also, inspection instructions
can be attached to inspection rules in the form of a document.
The purpose of an inspection document is to collect data for the inspection, and
following the inspection, to enable the ﬁndings and indications to be entered. Such
error sets serve as a valuable information source, particularly in the vendor selec-
tion process within the context of procurement logistics. They also enable quality
improvements and process optimization by allowing you to set measures required
for the elimination of error sources.
After a quality inspection is completed, a decision regarding the use of the tested
objects must be made. This decision is based on the inspection ﬁndings and,
depending on the application decision, can trigger follow-up actions. They include:

Quality inspection at the work center
Figure 3.56 shows a work center for quality inspections. The left portion of
the screen includes the storage section, the HUs to be inspected and the
number of the generated follow-up activity.
The right side contains information on the product and reference to the
inspection document (3000000033). In this example, the contents of HU
84000032 are inspected. This HU is a customer return. The results are
recorded in the inspection document, and the system automatically deter-
mines a follow-up activity. In this case, that action is putaway (indicated by
the abbreviation PTWY).
Through integration with SAP Customer Relationship Management (SAP
CRM), inspection ﬁndings can be evaluated and logistics follow-up actions trig-
gered, such as a stock transfer or scrapping. Based on the ﬁndings, in the case of
customer returns, CRM can dynamically determine the credit amount depending on
the condition of the returned goods. In addition to SAP CRM, quality inspections
can be integrated in various applications of SAP Business Suite as well as non-SAP
applications with the aid of the Quality Inspection Engine.
Putaway in the destination storage bin completes the goods receipt process. The
goal of this step, which is also mapped in the system as a warehouse task (Fig. 3.57),
is the ﬁnal placement of products in the warehouse. When the putaway warehouse
task is conﬁrmed, the material is posted to its storage bin and the quant of that
storage bin is updated (Fig. 3.58).
Warehouse task for putaway
Figure 3.57 shows the manual creation of a warehouse task for putaway for
Warehouse Request 112. The 10 delivered pieces are to be moved from the
source storage bin (GR-ZONE, indicating the goods receipt area) to a desti-
nation bin (0020-01-01-A). When the warehouse task is created, the system
generates a warehouse order. Figure 3.58 shows the manual conﬁrmation of
Warehouse Order 200055. After the material has been put away, the respec-
tive employee conﬁrms that the quantity to be moved has been brought to the
source storage bin. He now has the option of entering any quantity deviations
and exceptions.

Warehouse-Internal Processes
Several warehouse-internal processes that cannot be speciﬁcally allocated to goods
receipts or issues exist in the same or similar form in WM (SAP ERP) and have
previously been mentioned. In this section, we will provide a brief explanation of
the functional characteristics and distinctive features of warehouse-internal pro-
cesses from the viewpoint of SAP EWM.

3.4.4.1
Slotting
Travel times are decisive factors in the evaluation of logistics costs, especially for
picking. The variety of products in a warehouse and an ever-changing product
portfolio often make optimal storage of each individual product even more chal-
lenging. With EWM’s integrated function of slotting, a storage bin can be automat-
ically determined for the putaway of all products from which picking and placing is
the most efﬁcient. The putaway of materials in stock in an economically efﬁcient
manner not only represents an optimization of warehouse-internal processes
but also a potential for rationalization in many companies. For this reason, it is
important to minimize travel times and store each material optimally, based on a
storage concept. Within the context of slotting, SAP EWM supports the automatic
determination of storage concepts.
The storage concept is based on master data, requirement forecasts and packag-
ing data, and represents the basic parameters relevant for optimal putaway. In
contrast to the following description of storage bin determination within the context
of putaway control, these parameters are not dependent on a speciﬁc storage
process type, but describe the basic requirements and characteristics of a material
at the storage bin, storage section and putaway strategy to be employed. In this
regard, the slotting process determines the putaway and picking control indicator,
maximum quantity of a material in the storage type and the storage section indica-
tor, as well as the storage bin types applicable for a putaway. These parameters are
updated in the product master and used for putaway control (see Fig. 3.59).
To determine the maximum quantity in a storage type and to control putaway in
relation to the turnover frequency, EWM requires the actual or forecast requirement
Fig. 3.59 Slotting in the storage product master
186
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

of a material. This requirement data is provided to EWM by SAP APO and updated
in the slotting data of a storage material.
For the determination of the optimal storage bins, EWM accesses the slotting
data. To optimize the organization of materials in a warehouse, for instance with
regard to their turnover frequency, EWM offers a warehouse organization option.
This option, called rearrangement, enables the reorganization of products in the
warehouse based on optimal parameters of the slotting function, thus contributing
considerably to the reduction of travel times. For rearrangement, the current storage
bin is compared with the optimal storage bin. If the optimal storage bin is not
already in use, EWM suggests the optimal bin. The warehouse tasks for stock
transfer to the optimal bins can be consolidated into waves. They can then be
executed together and do not have a disruptive effect on other processes.
Parallel to the functions in WM, Inventory in EWM is also executed on the
warehouse level and guarantees that the right product is situated in the right place
and amount. Not least for legal reasons, inventory is performed as a physical
counting of products and handling units. The system can be controlled in a ﬂexible
manner with regard to the frequency and method with which certain items should or
must be inventoried. In addition, EWM enables the product- or storage-bin-related
taking of inventory.
The storage-bin-related inventory refers to taking inventory of a speciﬁc storage
bin and all materials or HUs situated in that bin. On the other hand, product-related
inventory relates to a certain material that can be located in several storage bins or
various HUs. The inventory processes used correspond to legally permitted
possibilities and, from a functional standpoint, to the inventory processes in WM
that have already been explained.
As in WM, EWM also supports periodic inventory, continuous inventory and
cycle counting. For continuous inventory, the inspections discussed above at
storage bins or product-related inspections are supported for ad-hoc inventory-
taking.
A special feature of storage-bin-related inventory is the low stock check. For this
inventory simpliﬁcation process, which is nothing more than an accompanying
inventory during putaway or picking, inspection takes place when the warehouse
tasks are conﬁrmed. Using a limit value, remaining low stock in a storage bin is
counted during picking without explicitly causing a physical inventory taking.
During physical picking, the system often checks to determine whether the low
stock captured in a sight check corresponds to the actual stock situation. Upon
conﬁrmation of the warehouse task, EWM automatically generates the inventory
document. In addition to the inventory procedures, EWM offers the possibility of
combining various procedures for low stock check.
The inventory-taking process is comparable with that described for WM (see
Fig. 3.35). In EWM, an inventory document is also generated and lists the storage
bins and materials that need to be counted. The option of a recount is based on the
determined quantity or value differences with the aid of a difference analysis.
To analyze differences and subsequently post stock in ERP’s inventory manage-
ment, in EWM you use the Difference Analyzer. It accumulates any detected
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
187

differences and reconciles them with conﬁgurable tolerance groups. Before a
difference is ultimately deleted from the accounts of the ERP system, it can be
blocked from further analysis. An employee can enter notes or make corrections on
the detail level. As soon as the status of a blocked difference permits, the stock is
offset against the ERP system. In ERP stock management, a corresponding goods
movement is generated for the difference quantity. If and to what extent certain
users can post differences can be set in EWM and inﬂuenced by maximum amounts
or percentage-based limits.
3.4.4.2
Scrapping
Some of the daily processes in a warehouse are those that cause a reduction in stock
in the warehouse management system. These processes, known as scrapping, are,
functionally speaking, goods issues in which the material to be scrapped is taken
from its storage bin and removed from stock. Whether or not scrapping is necessary
depends on the condition of the material, that is, if it is either damaged or has
become unusable in some other way. In EWM, we differentiate between the
following cases, depending on where the decision to scrap is made:
•
Warehouse-internal scrapping
•
Scrapping in a quality inspection
In both cases, actual scrapping represents a goods issue that is mapped in the
system through a posting change notice, which forms the basis for generating a
warehouse task for scrapping. The material to be scrapped can be picked and moved
to a scrapping work center. Once there, and after any necessary packaging of the
material, an outbound delivery and goods issue are generated.
For warehouse-internal scrapping, the stock is allocated to a storage bin or a
speciﬁc partial quantity of another stock category. After this block has taken place,
a goods issue is posted for the respective stock. This process can be triggered by a
transfer posting from the ERP system or from the warehouse (EWM). The decision
to scrap a material that is made internally generally occurs during picking or while
taking inventory.
Another option is scrapping within the course of a quality inspection when you
have an inspection lot and results. Here, too, the process can be triggered ware-
house-internally or externally. Thus, an employee from the quality department can
make the decision to scrap based on the results of an inspection procedure. From a
quality inspection point of view, which we have described in Sect. 3.4.3, “Goods
Receipt”, scrapping represents a follow-up process (see also Fig. 3.56).
3.4.4.3
Kitting
Kitting is a term from the realm of procurement and production logistics. It refers to
the combination of individual parts according to customer speciﬁcations and their
188
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

delivery as a kit. Kits are either delivered unassembled or assembled. However,
delivery to customers (as opposed to stock transfers, for instance) is always done in
kit form, that is, unassembled. The advantage of kitting to the customer is that it can
speed up production. Kitting becomes especially attractive when procurement
logistics must be cut.
The kitting process in EWM allows you to combine kits within a warehouse. For
this, EWM uses orders for logistics value-added services. The combination proce-
dure is typically done in work centers within the warehouse. EWM supports two
processes for kitting:
•
Kit-to-stock
•
Kit-to-order
The kit-to-stock process involves producing kits in advance and storing them in
stock. Kitting begins either in ERP, manually on the basis of a production order, or
directly in EWM with the aid of a direct outbound delivery order. In both cases,
kitting requires an outbound and inbound delivery document for stock. When
kitting is generated based on an ERP production order, the inbound delivery is
automatically generated and already contains the components it requires. Both
delivery documents are replicated by the ERP system to SAP EWM. The outbound
delivery order for kitting represents a warehouse request and generates the order for
logistics value-added service. After the warehouse tasks for picking of kitting
components have been generated, the order is moved to the kitting work center.
Once a kit has been put together, the processed components are deleted from stock
with a goods issue posting. The components have been turned into a kit whose
addition to stock is posted to an inbound delivery with a goods issue.
Unlike kitting to stock, kit-to-order processes involve compiling the required
components based on an order, similar to make-to-order production. If the required
kit is not in stock, it is either generated as a part of picking or as a logistics value-
added service at a work center. When a kit is composed at the time of picking, the
required components are taken from stock and directly assumed in a picking
handling unit without having to take place at a work center. When kitting takes
place as a logistics value-added service, the order for the logistics value-added
service is either automatically or manually generated, depending on system
settings. At the time of the order generation, EWM selects the work center in
which kitting is to take place and generates the warehouse tasks for picking kit
components. The destination storage bin of these warehouse tasks corresponds to
the work center for kitting. The ﬁnished kits are then processed further, depending
on the storage control stored in the system, packaged if needed, and subsequently
moved to the goods issue area.
The kit consists of the kit header and kit components (see Fig. 3.60). The kit
header shows the material ordered by a customer, especially for a kit-to-order
procedure. In our example, this material is “Spare parts components”. This mate-
rial, the so-called header material, is divided into its components, which together
form the kit structure. Our example lists two components to our spare parts kit.
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
189

iPPE structure in APO
Figure 3.60 shows the assembly structure in APO. The integrated Product
and Process Engineering (iPPE) contains the kit structure with header and
components. In this example, the kit header “SPM_KIT_01” consists of two
components. Both the header and the allocated components are stored in the
system as product masters. You can also indicate the quantity of the required
products for each component.
Kits are not saved as master data in EWM. For a kit-to-order process,
EWM receives the kit structure from the ERP system. Depending on whether or
not APO is used for the availability check, and whether the order was generated in
the CRM system, the kit structure can also be determined using integrated Product
and Process Engineering in APO. Within the context of this determination, the
sales order of the CRM system performs a rule-based availability check in APO.
The kit header material is dissolved according to the structure stored in APO, and
the required components are determined. The actual availability check is then
performed for the required kit components.
If neither SAP APO nor SAP CRM is used, the structure can also be determined
in ERP with the aid of a bill of materials (BOM). Along with the packing speciﬁ-
cations, this data serves as the basis for the compilation of the kit in EWM. When
kitting is performed to stock, EWM always consults a BOM stored in ERP.
To break down an existing kit back into its components, EWM can generate
an order for a logistics value-added service. Like kitting-to-stock, reverse
kitting begins with an outbound delivery order and an inbound delivery. A
goods issue is posted for the disassembled kit, and a goods receipt is posted for
the former kit components. By conﬁrming the respective warehouse tasks, stock is
adjusted accordingly in ERP, and a goods receipt and issue are posted in stock
management.

3.4.4.1
Replenishment
Within a warehouse, picking is often only done in one speciﬁc subarea. Thus,
efﬁcient and economical picking requires the necessary materials to be immediately
available at the time of picking. EWM supports efﬁcient picking with various
replenishment strategies that ensure a needs-based control of stock in the respective
picking areas.
Replenishment is ﬂexibly integrated in existing logistics processes and can be
executed either at set or dynamic times using minimum and maximum quantities.
The warehouse product master contains the required information on minimum and
maximum stock levels, as well as on requested replenishment quantities of a material.
If a deﬁned minimum stock level for replenishment is reached, a replenishment order
is automatically generated and the storage bin is ﬁlled again with pallet units until the
maximum level is reached. Demand-based replenishment plans are based on open
warehouse requirements. Direct or exception-based replenishment processes react to
incorrect quantities that are detected during warehouse task conﬁrmation.
With regard to this function, we differentiate between the following types of
replenishment control:
•
Planned replenishment
Planned replenishment is either started manually or automatically. The replen-
ishment quantity is planned by the system on the basis of deﬁned maximum and
minimum quantities and is triggered precisely when the current stock is lower
than the deﬁned minimum quantity.
•
Order-related replenishment
For order-related replenishment, the replenishment quantity is determined based
on open warehouse requests. Replenishment is triggered when the actual stock is
lower than the determined required quantity. This type of replenishment can also
be executed manually or in the background.
•
Automatic replenishment
For automatic replenishment, the system automatically determines replenish-
ment upon conﬁrmation of a warehouse task based on the actual stock and the
stored minimum quantity.
•
Direct replenishment
Direct replenishment control can be initiated directly through an exception code
during picking. Direct replenishment can then be performed by a picking
employee.
Transfer posting and stock transfer are also warehouse-internal processes.
3.4.4.2
Transfer Posting and Stock Transfer
The major characteristics and differences between transfer postings and stock
transfers were discussed in this chapter with regard to inventory management and
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
191

illustrated with the example of warehouse management in WM. In this section, we
will explain the special technical process features of transfer postings and stock
transfers in EWM.
The transfer posting of a material, in which no change in the physical location of
stock generally takes place, can be triggered by ERP as well as directly in EWM.
For a transfer posting initiated in ERP, an outbound delivery is generated in ERP
and replicated in EWM. These outbound deliveries represent a warehouse request
in EWM, which ﬁrst determines the storage process type. Depending on system
settings, a transfer posting can be posted at that point or, if the material is also to be
moved to another bin in the warehouse, a warehouse task can be created. When the
transfer posting is booked in EWM, the goods issue for outbound delivery is posted
in ERP and the stock attributes are adjusted accordingly.
A transfer posting can also be exclusively generated in EWM. This is either done
as a direct transfer posting or a posting via a warehouse request document that
serves as the basis for the generation of warehouse tasks if the material must also be
moved. When the transfer posting is booked in EWM, a goods movement is
generated in ERP.
The physical movement of a material within a company from one organizational
unit to another, and typically between one warehouse to another, is known as a stock
transfer. In ERP, a stock transfer and outbound delivery are generated for this
purpose. The outbound delivery is distributed to the issuing EWM system, where it
triggers an outbound delivery order. Goods issue in EWM leads to a goods issue in
ERP. If the receiving storage location is also managed with EWM, an inbound
delivery is generated in ERP and replicated to the receiving EWM system (see
Fig. 3.61). If the receiving storage location is not managed with EWM, the goods
receipt in the receiving location can also be posted to ERP together with the goods
issue posting of the outbound delivery. In such a case, if WM is used for the
warehouse management of this storage location, this goods movement represents
a WM transport requirement (see Fig. 3.20).
3.4.5
Goods Issue
From a logistics perspective, goods issues serve the controlled reduction of stock.
Such stock reduction is executed based on sales and distribution processes. From
the viewpoint of distribution logistics, a goods issue thus represents the completion
of a shipping procedure to the customer and serves as an interface between internal
and external logistics. Like a goods receipt, the information ﬂow in the goods issue
process is primarily based on spatial circumstances, the materials to be picked and
individual process requirements in the warehouse. These requirements can vary
from warehouse to warehouse, and may even be dependent on the respective goods
recipient. For this core process, SAP EWM offers a variety of design options and
enables the integration of individual process steps. In this section, we will use an
example to illustrate the basic goods issue process in EWM.
192

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

3.4.5.1
Documents in the Goods Issue Process
The central document in goods issue is the outbound delivery. It typically
represents a follow-on document to a sales order, but can also be created directly,
without reference to a preceding document in ERP. The physical shipment, which
forms the completion of a goods issue procedure, thus begins with the generation of
an outbound delivery document in ERP (Fig. 3.62).
Whether it is necessary to distribute this document to a decentralized EWM
depends on the WM warehouse number that is allocated to a delivery item. As in the
goods receipt process, the system checks to determine whether or not the warehouse
number indicates a decentralized warehouse (see Fig. 3.1).
If an outbound delivery is relevant to processing in EWM, the document is
replicated in the decentralized warehouse system (EWM), where it generates an
outbound delivery request. This document basically contains the same information
and has the same structure as an outbound delivery in ERP, and is activated upon
successful replication (see Fig. 3.63).
Outbound delivery in SAP ERP
Figure 3.63 shows Outbound Delivery 80016886, which has been generated
in ERP without reference to a sales order. The respective plant/storage

location combination is assigned the warehouse number EW1. This indicates
a decentralized, EWM-managed warehouse. Thus, the document is replicated
as an outbound delivery request to EWM.
The activation of an outbound delivery request immediately triggers an out-
bound delivery order, the actual warehouse request, which initiates the goods issue
process in EWM (see Fig. 3.64).
The outbound delivery order (see also Fig. 3.66) contains data assumed from the
preceding document as well as all necessary information to trigger the goods issue
process and monitor it accordingly. From the perspective of warehouse manage-
ment, the outbound delivery order represents a work list that is only completed
when the picked materials have been loaded and shipped. When the outbound
delivery request is activated and the outbound delivery order is automatically
generated, EWM begins all procedures required to supply the document with the
necessary information and map the process in accordance with the settings in the
system based on process- or layout-oriented storage control.
A special kind of goods issue processing is a manual direct outbound delivery
order, which is created directly in EWM and initially without reference to an ERP
document. It has a structure corresponding to an outbound delivery order. After it is

created, the document is transmitted to ERP and subsequently contains the ERP
document number.
We brieﬂy mentioned direct outbound delivery orders for the kit-to-stock pro-
cess. In this regard, they reserve the components necessary for the kit. They serve as
the ﬁnal step in the scrapping process by deleting the material to be scrapped from
stock upon goods issue. In addition, this document can be used when customers
pick up materials or for material removals posted to an account. For direct sales,
such an order is a pick-up from the warehouse without having to previously create a
sales order. In order for this process to be invoiced, the direct outbound delivery
order generates an outbound delivery in SAP ERP.
When the outbound delivery order is generated, the system ﬁrst determines the
warehouse process type and route, and then conducts a rough estimate of the
picking storage bin (source storage bin) based on a picking strategy. At the same
time, the staging area (destination storage bin) is determined using the warehouse
process type.

Fig. 3.64 Outbound delivery request in EWM
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
195

To determine the source storage bin from which the material is to be picked, the
storage type is ﬁrst determined for picking. Storage type determination is based on a
storage type search sequence and a removal rule. The storage type search sequence
indicates which storage types are to be searched for the stock to be picked, and is
primarily determined on the basis of product characteristics and item data from the
outbound delivery order. As a result of storage type determination, the storage type
is ascertained for picking (see Fig. 3.65). The determination of the storage bins from
which stock is to be picked is the task of the outbound delivery strategy.
For goods issue, the picking strategy aids in ﬁnding the optimal picking storage
bin. The picking strategy is mapped with a removal rule that is allocated to a
speciﬁc storage type to be searched via the determined storage type search sequence
(see Fig. 3.65). This removal rule represents a type of sorting rule, and contains the
criteria with which the determined storage bins are to be sorted. Such sorting
criteria include the goods receipt date of the last stock addition or the stock quantity
available in the storage bin. Based on this sorting, EWM uses the picking strategies
stored in the system. Possible picking strategies include:
•
First in, ﬁrst out (FIFO)
•
Last in, ﬁrst out (LIFO)
•
Partial quantities ﬁrst
•
According to quantity
•
Shelf life expiration date
•
Fixed bin
The management-based background of these strategies has already been
explained in connection with the removal control of WM (See Sect. 3.3.4,
“Goods Issue”). The functions of these picking strategies can be expanded or
adapted in EWM with the aid of business add-ins (BAdIs).

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

Multi-client capability of SAP EWM
In this regard, we would like to mention the multi-client capability of
SAP EWM. By precisely entering the owner and authorized parties as a
stock attribute, stock can be logically separated. The system ensures that
the permissible stock is always determined in the picking process. This is one
of the functions that make EWM suitable for use by logistics service pro-
viders whose warehouse management includes maintenance of the stock of
various customers. The system not only ﬁnds the desired picking storage bin,
but also checks the ownership circumstances of the quants stored there and
veriﬁes whether the required quantity can be removed at all.
Outbound delivery order (warehouse request)
Figure 3.66 shows Outbound Delivery 113, which was generated from the
activated Outbound Delivery Request 80016886. The system has already
determined the warehouse process type (2010) for each item and the destina-
tion storage bin (GI-ZONE) for staging. In addition, the item data includes
information on the type of stock from which picking is to take place, as well
as other stock attributes such as authorized personnel and the owner of the
materials to be removed.
The path taken for physical outbound delivery to a goods recipient is deﬁned
through routes. Routes represent a sequence of legs connected by load transfer
locations, and they can be divided into various tours. The signiﬁcance and
characteristics of routes and transportation zones is described in Chap. 2, “Trans-
port Logistics”.
From the viewpoint of EWM, SCM route determination – known as the routing
guide – is used to ﬁnd routes that are best suited to send materials to the goods
recipient. The Routing Guide performs the following to determine a route:
•
Static route determination
•
Scheduling
•
Calculation of transportation costs
Actual route determination is based on a hierarchical relationship of means of
transport and the proﬁles stored in the system for the respective carriers and general
transportation costs.
The carrier proﬁle can be used to match carriers to geographical data, such as
locations and transportation zones serviced by them, that are taken into consider-
ation during the selection of a carrier and the route determination process. In
addition to the general transportation cost proﬁle, the carrier proﬁle enables the
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
197

maintenance of dimension-based transportation costs that take into account time,
distance and transport weights.
The general transportation cost proﬁle contains cost information relevant to
carrier, location, transportation and dimensions. For the location-relevant costs,
penalty costs can be deﬁned, depending on the priority of a speciﬁc location. These
penalty costs would then be valid for inbound deliveries that arrive too early or too
late. Transportation-relevant costs are one-time, ﬁxed transportation costs for each
means of transport. General and carrier-based proﬁles are used along with the routes
and transportation zones stored in the system for route determination.
Static route determination puts together tours based on the routes and actual
transport requirements stored in the system. To do so, it ﬁrst determines the possible
geographical route. It then identiﬁes the individual locations for the route, which is
divided into legs. The resulting sequence of locations represents the ﬁnal tour.
For the scheduling process, the system determines the start and end dates for
each tour. When doing so, it takes into account load transfer times as well as the
duration of departure, transport and arrival at the destination, and calculates these as
forward or backward scheduling. In the default setting, EQM uses forward sched-
uling, which determines the latest planned goods issue date and changes the
Fig. 3.66 Outbound delivery order in EWM
198
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

planned delivery date accordingly. For backward planning, route determination and
scheduling starts from the planned delivery date, which is shortened by the times
stored in the system. If the resulting planned delivery date is earlier than the original
date or current day, backward scheduling leads to a conﬂict in dates. The system
reacts to this conﬂict according to the respective EWM settings. If there is no
conﬂict, backward scheduling supplies the latest possible date and time in which a
material must leave the warehouse or yard.
The system subsequently conducts a transportation cost determination for
the resulting tours and times. The transportation costs are added and contain the
actual cost of transportation for each leg, as well as any necessary penalty costs of
the tours for premature or late delivery. These costs are stored as a cost value in the
respective transportation cost and carrier proﬁles. Such cost values, which can be
compared to a score, have no dimensions and thus do not represent any particular
currency. Instead, their stored values serve solely to determine the most economical
route in EWM, and are not, for instance, used for a freight invoice. More informa-
tion can be found in the previous chapter, Chap. 2, “Transport Logistics”.
An important aspect of warehouse logistics is the staging of sales orders. Stock
removal involves picking certain partial quantities from a total quantity, based on
requirement information. From the viewpoint of EWM, these partial quantities are
items to be removed based on a warehouse request, and the total quantity refers to the
stock of the required material. Finding this stock and determining the picking storage
bin from which this stock is to be taken was the focus of the previous section.
EWM generally allows one- and two-step picking. It also enables you to integrate
the packaging process into picking. This procedure, called Pick & Pack, enables
direct picking in a shipping unit. An expansion of this function is the Pick, Pack &
Pass, procedure, a one-step picking procedure with decentralized picking and static
staging. Pick, Pack & Pass allows the work to be passed from one resource or
employee performing the work to another after part of the picking has taken place.
The sequence of warehouse tasks for stock removal can be determined according
to various criteria, such as the shortest path. EWM and the corresponding ERP
system are closely linked for the picking process. This allows picking speciﬁcations
such as batches or batch characteristics to be taken into account.
Stock removal is done with warehouse tasks, which can be generated in a variety
of ways and are subsequently conﬁrmed (see Fig. 3.68). Warehouse tasks can be
created manually. You also have the option of having them be generated automati-
cally as soon as incoming and outgoing deliveries are received by EWM. The third
option is the creation of warehouse tasks in the course of wave processing. The basic
functions of wave management are explained above in connection with warehouse
tasks and orders in Sect. 3.4.2, “Warehouse Organization and Stock Movement”.
Manual creation of a warehouse task for stock removal
Figure 3.67 shows manual creation of a warehouse task for stock removal for
the outbound delivery of stock to be picked in accordance with Warehouse
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
199

Request 113 from the previous example (see also Fig. 3.64). The quantity to
be removed is to be picked from open stock, Bin 01-01-A in Storage Type
0020 and taken to the goods issue area (GI-ZONE).
Stock removal with the aid of picking waves enables the bundling of stock removal
warehouse tasks into work packages and their collective processing. The advantage of
making bundles, or waves, lies in the optimization and rationalization of processes for
goods issue. Waves are made by combining warehouse request items based on
common activity areas, routes or materials in wave picks. The individual criteria
and attributes for wave generation can be stored in the system as speciﬁcations and
serve as the infrastructure for automatic or manual creation of waves.
In operational practice, physical picking starts with grouping delivery items into
waves. In doing so, even the existing conveyor systems are taken into account. We
can use a pallet warehouse as an example: If the number of pallet storage locations
is known, EWM determines the probable workload. Subsequently, a wave can be
released. Certain waves, such as those for full pallets, are generally selected in order
to bypass the conveyor system. Instead, they are picked from the reserves and
directly staged for outbound delivery, in order to keep the workload as minimal as
possible. Other items, for instance, are picked for the conveyor belt, where they can
Fig. 3.67 Warehouse task for stock removal
200
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

be conveyed to a palleting or package shipping station. Products are typically
loaded as soon as they have been packed on a pallet or packaged, and a goods
issue is subsequently posted.
Conﬁrming a stock removal
Figure 3.68 shows a manual conﬁrmation of Warehouse Task 3036, generated
for the warehouse request in the previous example. After an employee has
removed the respective quantity, he conﬁrms the time of removal and thus
the warehouse task.
When a warehouse task for stock removal is conﬁrmed, the stock is removed
from its source storage bin and moved to the destination storage bin. If a difference
in quantity is detected in the process because the picked quantity deviates from the
quantity to be picked, a further warehouse task can be created or the quantity to be
delivered is adjusted and diminished accordingly. When a second warehouse task is

Packing
In the realm of logistics material ﬂow, in addition to the goods to be transported,
focus is increasingly being shifted to shipping units. As a result, EWM offers a
variety of options for dissolving, forming, unpacking and labeling shipping units.
It can take on information from the ERP system, such as data on how shipments are
packed, to process those shipments further.
Packing in a work center
Figure 3.69 shows the manual packing of Material PROD-M02 in a work
center. The quantities to be packed are packaged with Packaging Material
WIREBASKET, after which Handling Unit JKT01 is generated. The HU, its
contents and the structure of the work center and its areas are displayed on the
left side of the work center. Packing can take place at this work center, and
materials can also be weighed or unpacked.
EWM can not only obtain and use the HUs mapped in ERP, but it can also utilize
packaging speciﬁcations that are stored elsewhere. This master data enables you to
deﬁne packaging materials and work steps for various products and processes to be
accessed and used in subsequent process steps. For example, such packaging
speciﬁcations can be used when packing products in the shipping department or
performing a logistics value-added service. The packaging specs can also be printed
and used as work instructions.

3.4.5.1
Loading and Goods Issue
As soon as the materials have been packed, the resulting packages (HUs) are
usually loaded, and the goods issue is then posted (see Fig. 3.70). The system can
also automatically determine the staging area and door for goods issue in advance,
which is based on the route determined when the outbound delivery order was
generated.
Like unloading for goods receipt, physical loading can be done in a simple or
complex manner. The goods issue can be posted at various times. Because loading
is an optional step, the goods issue can be posted without previous loading,
depending on system settings. Alternatively, posting can be done after loading or,
if Yard Management is used, at the latest after the transportation unit has left the
warehouse grounds. When the goods issue is booked, EWM informs Inventory
Management in ERP of the change in stock (see Fig. 3.61).
In certain cases, especially for international shipments, it may be necessary to
generate an invoice before the goods issue has been posted. Normally, invoice
generation is done as soon as the goods issue has been posted and the delivery status
of the outbound delivery allows invoicing. In the case of invoicing before a goods
issue, EWM sends an invoice request to the ERP or CRM system, depending on
which is used for invoicing. The invoice request is based on one invoice per
shipment or on one or more invoices for the complete contents of a vehicle or
transportation unit.
The outbound delivery is a follow-on document of the outbound delivery order,
and represents proof of the physical delivery of the picked materials to the ship-to

party. It is the basis for printing delivery notes or the electronic transmission of a
shipping notiﬁcation. From the goods issue view, it represents the completion of
goods issue processing and enables the posting or cancellation of the goods
movement (see Fig. 3.70).
3.4.5.2
Production Supply
Physical production in the sense of manufacture is not within the scope of this book.
With regard to production logistics, however (see Volume 1, Chap. 5), we explain
the requirement-related results of distribution logistics and the integration with the
procurement side. In this chapter, we view production supply solely from the
perspective of material provision of preliminary products and consumption
deliveries in the case of retrograde picking for manufacture.
With its component Production Supply, SAP EWM 7.0 ﬁlls a gap, enhancing
goods issue with an important process. The process of production supply includes
activities required for the provision of components to work centers or machines in
production (see Fig. 3.71). Depending on the branch of a company, the production
processes and materials employed, these processes differ greatly. Production order-
related, cross-production order or consumption-controlled provision procedures are
common basic strategies that can be tailored to individual needs. Yet within
companies, especially in the case of multi-step manufacturing processes or various
materials, a variety of procedures is often used for production supply.
In addition to the traditional order-based production supply, EWM allows the
mapping of cross-order or consumption-based strategies, such as kanban. SAP
EWM supports the following application components of ERP production:
•
Production orders
•
Process orders
•
Make-to-stock production (repetitive manufacturing)
•
Kanban
A central SAP term in the mapping and control of these processes is the
production supply area (PSA). Using PSAs, various degrees of detail of production
supply can be mapped. For instance, related work centers can be grouped and
centrally supplied. On the other hand, if very precise provision is required for an
individual work center, such as in the case of system-led setups, materials can be
directed to particular bins or trays. Production supply can thus be made as detailed
as desired and adjusted to optimally meet production requirements.
From the perspective of EWM, the PSA contains one or more storage bins in
which materials for production are staged and then consumed by production. As
such, the production supply process can be divided into two steps in EWM:
1. Staging of products in the PSA
2. Consumption of productions in the PSA through picking for production
204
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

For staging, products are brought to the production supply area. Depending on
whether the PSA is an EWM-controlled storage area, staging is done with the aid of
inbound or outbound deliveries or as stock transfer. The result in any case is an
increase in stock in the PSA.
First, the materials required for production must be staged with a delivery to the
production supply area in ERP. This outbound delivery is replicated in EWM,
where it generates an outbound delivery request and, once that request is activated,
an outbound delivery order. Warehouse tasks are then generated for the delivery
order, and the PSA is supplied with the necessary materials. This increase in stock
in the PSA is reported to the ERP system, where it also leads to a goods movement.
Consumption in the case of retrograde stock removal is mapped with the aid of a
consumption delivery in the system. After receiving conﬁrmation from the produc-
tion order, the ERP system generates a consumption delivery that is replicated in
the EWM system, where it generates an outbound delivery. The items of this
document are not relevant to stock removal, so the goods issue is thus posted

3.4.6
Cross-Warehouse Functions
SAP EWM offers functions that cannot be allocated to one speciﬁc system area, but
are available for all warehouse processes. These are cross-process functions in
goods receipt and issue – especially including cross-docking and yard management.
They also represent various functions for warehouse optimization and control with
the aid of modern automation technology.
When the operational size of warehouses increases and logistics processes
become more complex, the efﬁcient planning of resources and employees becomes
ever more difﬁcult. In order to measure and increase productivity through
optimized planning in this realm, EWM has Labor Management. Labor Manage-
ment offers a comprehensive spectrum of functions for the planning and control of
warehouse employee labor and for performance measurement using standardized
speciﬁcations and formula-based key performance indicators. These functions and
the preview of the expected work load enable resources to be planned more
efﬁciently.
Labor Management can be activated for a speciﬁc warehouse number and certain
process steps. Through its activation, EWM requests the start and end time when
certain activities are performed, such as when warehouse tasks are conﬁrmed.
Using this data, the system can determine whether the times stored in the system
for a certain task have been adhered to. It is also possible to communicate this
information to the human resources management component HCM to compensate
activities in a performance-related manner. Labor Management in EWM supports
the following activities:
•
Warehouse orders with warehouse tasks
•
Tasks for logistics value-added services
•
Quality inspection documents
•
Inventory documents
•
Indirect work not directly related to warehouse activity, such as an employee
cleaning a resource
Employees can immediately check their productivity themselves by viewing the
transaction results on their wireless data devices or warehouse management moni-
tor, accessible through their desktop (see Fig. 3.72).
Every task in the warehouse is linked to a certain work effort. To plan and
evaluate the work load, the system needs the extent of time for an activity, but also
the actual duration and information regarding the resource performing the task. For
this purpose, a document on the planned work load is generated per activity area
and process step. This document allows the planned duration to be compared with
the actual duration.

Warehouse Management Monitor for Labor Management
Figure 3.72 shows the Warehouse Management Monitor, with which the
operator, warehouse manager or group manager can access information
relevant to Labor Management. In addition to receiving precise conﬁrmation
times, you can evaluate the efﬁciency of employees or determine the weight
moved within one day in a speciﬁc activity area.
3.4.6.1
Resource Management
In addition to Labor Management, Resource Management also increases the efﬁ-
ciency of warehouse processes by optimizing the management and distribution of
warehouse tasks with the aid of queues. A queue is a series of speciﬁc warehouse
tasks to be performed. The resources are the units represented by a warehouse
employee and certain equipment, mentioned at the start of this chapter.
Resources and warehouse tasks are allocated to queues. This optimization
primarily lies in the automatic allocation of a required resource to a speciﬁc
warehouse task and the allocation of resources that are best suited for a particular
activity. Various factors are taken into account when this decision is made, such
as the latest starting date, the performance priority of a task, the allocated queue,
the qualiﬁcation of a resource and the warehouse order status. A warehouse order
already represents an optimally executable work package that a warehouse
employee is to carry out within a speciﬁed time. The contents of the order are
either inventory items or warehouse tasks that are combined into warehouse orders
and are ready for processing. The generation of warehouse orders has already been
explained; allocation of warehouse orders to warehouse employees is done via
Resource Management. Physical allocation can be performed manually or
automatically.

3.4.6.2
Catch Weight Management
Especially in the food industry, goods frequently differ with regard to the weight of
each individual product, such that a ﬁxed conversion factor to convert a unit such as
a “piece” (see below) to a weight unit cannot be determined. Often, an average
value is used, which frequently leads to problems. EWM solves these problems
with the aid of Catch Weight Management. This function enables the stock man-
agement of products for which two independent quantity units of equal status are
deﬁned.
Catch weight capabilities are completely integrated in the delivery process, such
that they do not change anything in the process for inbound and outbound
deliveries. For goods movements, the EWM system updates both product
quantities. Also, to control internal material ﬂow, you have the option of deﬁning
the processes for which a valuation quantity is to be maintained. Catch weight
functionalities are also integrated in the inventory and quality-inspection processes.
Material with quantities of equal status
Packaged beef is stored in portion sizes. The logistics quantity, or base
quantity, in which the packing unit is maintained is the “piece”. The valuation
quantity, upon which the valuation price and subsequent sales price are based,
is the “gram”. In this example, both quantities are independent yet have equal
status.
3.4.6.3
Packaging and Logistics Value-Added Services
In the past, packaging served solely to protect goods. Through altered sales and
distribution structures in distribution logistics, especially with regard to an increas-
ing internationalization of goods ﬂows, packaging today has storage and transpor-
tation functions and facilitates identiﬁcation and information in the sales process.
Packaging processes and logistics value-added services in general are especially
important to logistics service providers to garner a competitive advantage.
In addition to packaging processes, logistics value-added services include prod-
uct ﬁnishing, the simple assembly and labeling of materials or Hus, and kitting.
In order to perform logistics value-added services efﬁciently and economically,
they are generally directly integrated in the material ﬂow, the logistics process
chain in the warehouse. From the perspective of storage control, it is often an
interim step that is built into process-oriented storage control and executed before
ﬁnal putaway or staging in the goods issue area. Actual execution of logistics value-
added services is done in a work center in the EWM system.
EWM supports logistics value-added services and their processing in connection
with inbound and outbound deliveries. The tasks to be performed are mapped as
activities and consolidated in an order for logistics value-added services (VAS).
These VAS orders can be created manually as well as automatically. The order
208
3
Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

consists of an order header, the activities to be performed, the items and any
required auxiliary products. As a system document, its basic purpose is to inform
warehouse employees of the work steps that need to be carried out. It documents
tasks actually performed and any auxiliary products consumed. It can also be used
as a calculation base for the invoicing of work done by internal or external service
providers.
3.4.6.4
Yard Management
With the increase in size of freight yards, or yards for short, the management of
vehicles is becoming ever more complex, frequently leading to longer immobiliza-
tion times. Efﬁcient yard management reduces trucks’ immobilization times and
increases the number of vehicles that can be processed per hour.
EWM makes it possible to manage your yard – your own parking lot structures,
warehouse doors and the individual transportation units – in a clearly arranged and
efﬁcient manner. In addition, stock still on vehicles can be taken into account in
the running processes of a warehouse. Vehicle parking spaces are mapped by
the software as standard storage bins that can be combined into yard areas. The
registration of vehicles that arrive in or leave the yard is done at checkpoints. From
there, trucks and trailers are led toward a parking space or door for immediate
loading and unloading. In order to optimize the use of the facilities, an incoming
trailer can be unloaded and then loaded right away as an outgoing trailer. Move-
ment in the freight yard can be achieved via wireless data transmission or desktop
transactions.
The functional requirements of a warehouse management system are growing
constantly, following the general trend of increased automation and mechanization
of work processes. In distribution logistics, when customers are supplied, punctual
delivery in perfect quality is the goal. In procurement logistics, suppliers are
changing their product range at shorter and shorter intervals. Added to this are
legal requirements on the product side regarding traceability and batch manage-
ment requirement. The resulting high demands to logistics can often only be met by
automated processes. Warehouse automation has thus been gaining in signiﬁcance.
It not only allows demands to be met, but also triggers a high potential for
optimization.
We will thus give you a short overview of the basic functions of SAP EWM-
supported automation technologies.
Radio frequency (RF) devices have been an indispensible part of logistics for
quite some time now. The decisive advantage is that communication with a
warehouse management system is not only possible from special work centers,
but can be carried out from virtually every location in a warehouse. In addition, the
devices replace all documents and allow a rapid and fault-free readout of coded
information, such as barcodes or 2D codes. The direct interaction offered by RF
devices enables correct data validation and ensures a high-quality standard in the
3.4
Warehouse Management with SAP EWM
209

warehouse by eliminating data-entry errors. SAP software is device-independent,
and possesses tools that can convert messages and information from a device.
SAP EWM enables the use of radio frequency in more areas than previous SAP
solutions. For instance, EWM lets you perform several activities with RF support,
including conﬁrming warehouse tasks, packaging, deconsolidation, loading and
unloading, and taking inventory. The RF environment also allows a tailored design
of the menu structure and the connection of third-party suppliers that have
specialized in visualization on mobile devices.
In addition to pure data entry with the aid of radio frequency devices and the
accompanying ﬂexibility and validation, the RF environment makes it possible to
optimize tasks and their execution with a variety of functions. Using the double
cycle with RF, the function known as interleaving, you can optimize resource
utilization through a reduction in travel times in the warehouse. The system avoids
deadheading (empty trips) or travel times by automatically assigning a resource to a
warehouse task after another warehouse task has been completed that is geographi-
cally located to the new resource item. In addition, you can use an execution
restraint to control the maximum number of permitted resources in a speciﬁc
storage area. The restraint enables resources to perform warehouse tasks in a
speciﬁc area as unhindered as possible and not hinder one another in the process.
For example, for semi-system-controlled processing, the system instructs the
warehouse employee to go to a speciﬁc storage bin and take out any HU. In this
case, the execution restraint determines the probable times in which the resources in
a certain area will be leaving that area. The calculation of the optimal route and the
times in the warehouse is based on a distance calculation. Depending on the
calculated time and the number of permitted resources, access can be allowed or
denied.
In addition to radio frequency connection, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID)
is being used more and more in logistics. In combination with the auto-ID infra-
structure (SAP AII), EWM supports the use of RFID for all prevalent processes,
such as goods receipt and issue (see Chap. 4, “Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk,
Compliance”). EWM uses SAP AII to communicate with RFID hardware such as
readers. It does not matter whether that reader is a mobile or static device or a tunnel
reader.
An increasing trend in logistics is the use of automatic warehouse and conveyor
technology. With the aid of the Material Flow System (MTS) integrated in EWM,
you can directly connect automated systems or warehouse and conveyor technology
to SAP and control them in real time. The connection of stored program control
(SPC) systems via communication channels and the mapping of checkpoints, rack
feeders, conveyor segments and the like can be conﬁgured using the system
settings. Based on the layout-oriented storage control, MFS lets you control the
entire material ﬂow via all automatic components of a warehouse. This close
integration enables all strategies to be transferred directly to the execution of
storage and conveyor technology.

Warehouse Logistics and Inventory Management

3.4.6.5
Cross-Docking
The direct transfer of materials or handling units from goods receipt to goods issue
without prior storage is called cross-docking. Forgoing storage and directly staging
goods in the goods issue area reduces warehouse movements and stockholding
costs. This process also enables an increase in warehouse efﬁciency. Lead times can
be considerably reduced, because the warehouse only serves as a load transfer site
and goods are only in the warehouse as long as is needed for transferring the load.
EWM supports various options for performing cross-docking processes (see
Table 3.3), that is, for transporting products directly from the goods receipt area
to the staging zones. This can be planned in advance, so that it is determined before
goods arrive that they are to be loaded in a cross-docking process. Alternatively, the
decision to use cross-docking can also be made after the goods have arrived in the
warehouse.
For planned cross-docking, when goods are received, it has already been deter-
mined that they will not be stored but will leave the warehouse via goods issue.
Planned cross-docking is done either as transportation cross-docking or merchan-
dise distribution. The latter is a branch-speciﬁc scenario that SAP requires for a
retail system and will not be explained in more detail.
Transportation cross-docking (TCD) is planned cross-docking for the optimiza-
tion of your transportation costs. It supports the transportation of HUs along a
variety of distribution centers or stock transfer locations up to the ﬁnal destination.
The advantages of this scenario lie in the fact that several deliveries can be
consolidated into new shipments, that the means of transport can be changed if
necessary, and that export activities can be processed centrally. The decision as to
whether or not cross-docking should be executed does not occur in EWM, but rather
ERP.
The process begins with a stock transfer order in ERP, which can be generated
automatically using APO or manually. Manual creation of a stock transfer order is
described in Volume 1, Chap. 4, “Procurement Logistics”. After the goods issue is
posted in the issuing warehouse, the EWM system that is to perform the cross-
docking receives the necessary inbound and outbound deliveries and information
regarding which delivery items are relevant to cross-docking. The reference is the
ERP stock transfer order number. As soon as the goods receipt has been posted,

EWM generates the warehouse tasks serving to move those goods to the goods issue
area. Conﬁrming these warehouse tasks triggers physical movement of the goods,
after which a goods issue is posted to complete the process.
In the case of unplanned or opportunistic cross-docking, the decision to either
store goods or move them directly to the goods issue area is based on the individual
situation. Performance is either in the form of a pick from goods receipt or a so-
called push deployment.
When goods are picked from goods receipt, cross-docking in the goods receipt
area begins with the standard inbound deliveries. EWM attempts to generate the
necessary warehouse tasks for putaway, and while doing so, it checks to see if
existing warehouse tasks for picking can be replaced. First, EWM determines
whether the delivered goods are relevant for a putaway delay. This is determined
based on the warehouse process type and the stock type of the goods, and leads to a
delay in the generation of warehouse tasks for putaway. The delay gives APO a
chance to verify whether any of the inbound delivery items are eligible for cross-
docking. If any backorders are present, an outbound delivery document is automat-
ically generated, and the goods are transferred to the goods issue area and brought
directly to a customer or another warehouse.
In the case of push deployment, APO determines whether the goods are to be
moved from one storage location to another. This decision is also triggered upon
goods receipt and is based on a turnover forecast stored in APO.
In the case of unplanned, opportunistic cross-docking, the respective decision is
not made in EWM but in APO. In exceptional cases, cross-docking can also be
decided in EWM.
Opportunistic cross-docking can also be controlled completely by EWM.
Whether or not a delivery item is eligible for cross-docking depends on the settings
stored in EWM and is not transmitted via ERP or APO. Cross-docking can be
performed for inbound as well as outbound deliveries. This type of cross-docking is
based on current data and requires the use of a radio frequency environment. In
order to avoid inconsistencies and because of the required timeliness, only those
warehouse tasks that are allocated to an RF environment are used.
When an inbound delivery is received, the system searches for suitable outbound
delivery items as soon as the goods receipt has been booked and the warehouse
tasks for putaway have been generated. If no outbound delivery items can be found,
the generated warehouse tasks are executed and the goods are placed into storage.
If, however, EWM ﬁnds open picking warehouse tasks, they are canceled. Subse-
quently, new warehouse tasks for picking are generated and allocated to the stock to
be put away.
The same functions are also available for goods issue. As soon as an outbound
delivery and its respective picking warehouse tasks have been generated, the system
searches for suitable inbound delivery items. The retrieved warehouse tasks are
canceled and the system generates new warehouse tasks for picking and allocates
them to the stock to be put away.

Summary
In this chapter, you have been introduced to the operational basis of warehouse
logistics, as well as the major differences between inventory management and
warehouse management with SAP. Inventory management serves to physically
manage stock in storage bins and manage stock movements in connection with
the processes of procurement, production and distribution logistics.
Today, companies expect an efﬁcient warehouse management system to not only
offer operative management of materials and their storage bins, but also a control
and monitoring system based on continual optimization of material ﬂow, equipment
and human resources, beginning with goods receipt and extending through all
storage and process levels leading to goods issue.
With Warehouse Management (WM) and the SCM-based SAP Extended Ware-
house Management (SAP EWM), SAP Business Suite offers two different systems
at once with which stock in a warehouse can be managed and monitored. The
respective area of usage ultimately depends on the business needs and economic
demands of an enterprise.
Functionally speaking, SAP EWM represents a further development of functions
already existing in WM, and also meets demands of third-party logistics (3PL) that
previously could only be covered on a limited basis. Therefore, EWM is especially
suited to logistics service providers, retail or companies dealing with replacement-
parts logistics. Such ﬁrms operate several warehouses with a high degree of
turnover and automation, as well as complex optimization strategies, and demand
uniform, comprehensive control. In addition to process- and layout-oriented storage
control, EWM offers multi-level, internal transportation using warehouse tasks, as
well as built-in options for warehouse automation and control.

Summary

Chapter 4
Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk,
Compliance
Trade formalities such as customs laws, trade agreements, environmental regulations,
or trade and product safety standards are increasingly inﬂuencing logistics processes.
This pertains to goods transport as well as internal logistics processes and collabora-
tion with business partners.
4.1
The Basics
In our global economy, the growing commodity ﬂow is accompanied by growing
challenges:
•
An increasing number of laws and regulations are leading to augmented risks in
processing, a higher degree of complexity and higher costs for the execution of
processes.
•
The increase in globalization automatically causes an increase in the quantity of
goods involved in cross-border trafﬁc.
•
New types of threats (such as terrorism and environmental problems) are leading
to the passing of more and more approval processes and test codes that must be
followed in domestic and international logistics.
•
With the progression of automatic processes used by the public authorities of
individual states, new electronic communications procedures are being provided
for data transfer to make processing more efﬁcient. However, this does not mean
that international standards exist for information transmission. Every nation or
union of nations is developing its own forms of communications. For example:
– ATLAS for electronic customs registration and administration ﬁles (such as
import fee notiﬁcations) in Germany
– NCTS (New Computerized Transit System) for transit processing within the
European Union
J. Kappauf et al., Logistic Core Operations with SAP,
DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-18202-0_4, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012
215

– AES (Automated Export System) for the registration of exports to the United
States
– e-Customs for customs registration in Japan
•
Because processing times for logistics processes are becoming increasingly
shorter, there is less and less time to fulﬁll the heightened level of regulations
and tests, which in turn raises risk.
Depending on the type of goods, departure and destination locations, transit
countries and involved business partners, a cross-border shipment can require the
correct generation and punctual submission of up to 35 documents. What is more,
up to 25 business partners and institutions have to communicate with one another,
including customs agents, freight carriers, logistics service providers, banks and
security administrations. Legal processing may require the consideration of as
many as 600 laws or 500 trade agreements, all of which can change continually.
Figure 4.1 shows a few examples of trade formalities that must be taken into
consideration for logistics processing between trade partners in various countries
or regions.
4.2
Process Risks
These complex, ever-changing rules mean a high risk that conformity problems will
arise in the execution of logistics processes. Such problems can stem from sources
including:
Compliance with goods storage 
and preference regulations?
(e.g. FDA – Food & Drug Admin.)
Trade partners checked and 
export licenses obtained? 
(e.g. EAR  export regulations)
Declaration at US 
customs authorities? 
(e.g. AMS – Automated 
Manifest System, 10+2)
Proof of preference

CAFTA)

Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk, Compliance

•
Faulty or imprecise data provided by suppliers
Imprecise data can cause delays in customs, import or export processing that
generally hinder the overall process and thus lead to higher costs or problems
with business partners.
•
An absence or lack of collaboration with partners and authorities
Collaboration problems also lead to delays or make repeated data entry neces-
sary in various systems that may in turn lead to faulty data.
•
Strict organizational or geographical separation of processing procedures
Due to the strict separation (silo principle) often also mirrored in the computer
systems, costs for adherence to regulations skyrocket.
•
No possibility of budgeting trade costs
If trade costs cannot be budgeted, not all savings opportunities can be achieved
when paying customs fees.
The risks described above can be reduced if suitable data processing systems
with high-performance integration and connectivity to business partners and
authorities are employed for documentation and process execution:
•
Through centralized systems, the data and processes required for processing can
be standardized, which ultimately leads to a reduction in costs for fulﬁllment of
formalities.
•
The connectivity and integration serve to generate an active and rapid distribu-
tion of information, such that all involved partners receive the necessary infor-
mation in a timely manner and in the desired quality.
•
An integrated function for risk management enables you to visualize and evalu-
ate company-wide risks.
•
Integration with business partners, such as logistics service providers, and the
opportunity to submit necessary documents to authorities yourself in electronic
form offer further potential for savings in process execution.
•
Integration with suppliers and the active monitoring of regulation fulﬁllment
ensure that business transactions with suppliers are processed properly.
SAP offers suitable software solutions for all of the above uses.

The ERP Foreign Trade component offers you the following core functions:
•
Efﬁcient integration into the ERP logistics document chain with the operation of
all import and export processes
•
Automatic veriﬁcation of export licenses based on current regulations
•
Simpliﬁed reporting through automatic procedures for the generation, print and
submission of reports
•
Identiﬁcation of products that are to be considered for preference processing
•
Integration with partners and authorities with the aid of EDI communication
(EDI: Electronic Data Interchange)
•
Accessibility of all foreign trade data in all relevant SAP components
The Foreign Trade component is integrated in the sales and distribution (SD) as
well as the materials management (MM) processes. The link to sales and distribu-
tion enables a precise processing of requests in foreign trade matters with regard to
goods issues and exports. In materials management, you can process goods receipts
and imports, and in the realm of documentary payments, there is integration of
foreign trade data with Financing. The Foreign Trade component thus assists you in
ensuring that your import and export transactions occur in a lawful manner, and that
fees to be paid to customs authorities can be calculated immediately and accurately.
SAP BusinessObjects Global Trade Services (GTS) is a component that acts as
an add-on to an SAP NetWeaver system. You can thus use the components in an
SAP system environment as well as with non-SAP systems. SAP BusinessObjects
Global Trade Services provides you with the following advantages in process
execution:
•
You can automate most of your international trade processes.
•
You can manage a large number of business partners and documents.
•
It is easier to comply with continually changing international laws.
•
You can cooperate with the modernized systems and electronic communication
means of government and customs ofﬁces.
Using GTS, you can avoid ﬁnancial risks and pricey delays in export and import
processes, and thus be able to react more quickly to international business
opportunities. The component offers the following core functions:
•
Compliance Management
– Sanctioned party list check and positive lists (with a simulation function)
– Proof of ofﬁcial audits
•
Export and import control
– Export legal control
– Import legal control
– Product classiﬁcation under import/export aspects
– Management of import and export licenses

Foreign Trade Processing with SAP ERP
Foreign trade processing in SAP ERP is integrated in all system components of the
ERP system and thus in the processes of procurement and sales and distribution
logistics. With such close integration, the system fulﬁlls all foreign-trade-related
requirements to enable goods receipts and imports as well as goods issue and cross-
border sales and distribution in compliance with legal regulations.
In this regard, the system helps you to observe the stipulations that exist between
your country and other countries set forth in various trade agreements. Speciﬁcally,
it supports trade within a customs union, trade based on free trade agreements, and
trade with a sovereign third country.
Therefore, the purpose of foreign trade processing with SAP ERP is not only to
provide the necessary functions, but also to ensure that import and export
transactions are compliant with the law; that foreign trade documents are generated
accordingly; and that any fees to be paid to customs ofﬁces are calculated immedi-
ately and precisely. In accordance with these tasks, ERP foreign trade processes are
divided into general foreign trade processing and the following areas, whose core
functions will be explained later in this section:
•
Legal control
•
Preference handling
•
Documentary payments
•
Communication and printing
•
Periodic declarations

Firstly, because of their central signiﬁcance to general foreign trade processing,
we will address the necessary master data, relevant documents and their integration.
4.4.1
Master Data and Integration
The master data used in the procurement and sales and distribution logistics
processes, including vendor, customer, material and purchasing information
records, contains foreign trade data. The respective process integration is depicted
in Fig. 4.2. This data is especially required for control of legal checks and prefer-
ence processing, and is directly brought over in documents as recommended values
or indirectly during the automatic determination of export-related information. The
import side includes all processes of cross-border procurement logistics. The export
side deals with cross-border goods trafﬁc in sales and distribution.
Complete master data records are a prerequisite for automated foreign trade control
and guarantee efﬁcient import and export processing. The customer and vendor master
data, information regarding countries and regions, and precise addresses determine the
geographical location and thus the customs process and legal controls that apply.

Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk, Compliance

One of these controls is the sanctioned party list check, which the system compares
to embargo and boycott lists to prevent a business transaction with certain
customers or those from certain regions. The vendor master contains further
information such as the import customs ofﬁce of the vendor through which goods
generally enter the country, Incoterms and the mode of transport via which the
imported goods will cross the border (such as postal, sea, air or road transport). If
required, ERP can maintain permissible combinations of modes of transport and
customs ofﬁces. The customs ofﬁce refers to the geographical location in which
goods are to be registered for import or export before they enter the free commerce
of the economic region or leave the sovereign territory of a country.
Among the general data contained in the customer master are the region and
country with which export business can be controlled in the sales and distribution
documents. The region of a customer is required for reports to authorities. Within
the context of risk management and in order to prevent a loss of accounts receiv-
able, you can set in the customer master whether a letter of credit is to be
automatically used as a safeguard when generating a sales document for a particular
customer (see Fig. 4.4). The documentary payments, or letter of credit processing,
will be detailed in the following section.
The material master record has its own foreign trade view in which the neces-
sary information can be maintained and tariff classiﬁcation – the allocation of a
commodity code – takes place. In addition to tariff classiﬁcation, the material
master includes information on the region and country of origin. This information
is required later for such tasks as preference determination.
Certain goods are to be reported to the respective authorities in stipulated units
of measure. The material master thus contains the particular unit of measure in
addition to the statistical commodity code.
A purchasing info record represents the link between vendor and material.
Purchasing info records facilitate the ordering procedure by saving supplier- and
material-related data. Data on foreign trade processing saved in the purchasing info
record overrides the vendor master record and enables a differentiated customs-
related control of import processes. In particular, data relevant to customs
preferences, such as preference zone and the status of a vendor declaration, are
automatically determined using preference processing.
Goods received or shipped within the context of procurement or distribution
logistics from the member state of a customs union are classiﬁed as receipt or issue.
If the goods are shipped from or to a country that is not a member of the same customs
union or territory, the receipt is classiﬁed as an import, and the issue as an export.
The documents required for logistics processing in Purchasing and Sales and
Distribution contain in their header and item levels all information necessary for
foreign trade processing in SAP ERP. In Purchasing, this data is recommended for
purchase orders and inbound deliveries from vendor and material master records as
well as purchasing info records. In Sales and Distribution, export-related informa-
tion is found in the sales order, delivery and billing documents from the customer
4.4
Foreign Trade Processing with SAP ERP
221

and material master records. This foreign trade data forms the basis for the correct
and legal processing of import and export business transactions, which are
explained in more detail in the following sections.
4.4.2
Legal Control
Import and export business transactions must be based on current laws and
regulations. In order to comply with legal requirements, the legal control function
offers a process-speciﬁc check based on the respective transaction and the customer
and country of destination of the export, in addition to product-speciﬁc checks of
the goods to be exported.
Sales processes are initially checked to verify that the shipment is not destined
for a country limited by an embargo or boycott or that the customer is not on a
sanctioned party list.
Subsequently, a check is performed to determine whether the material to be
exported requires an export license and if such a license has been properly
maintained in the system. Whether a material is subject to legal control depends
on its classiﬁcation and the foreign trade data maintained in the material master.
Foreign trade processing in SAP ERP offers the possibility of maintaining export
licenses and monitoring sales orders and deliveries with regard to their foreign trade
relevance, and blocking them if the necessary licenses do not exist.
4.4.3
Preference Determination
Preference determination establishes the ratio of origin and thus the degree of
added value of in-house-produced products based on value percentages, source and
originating status of the individual components. The originating status is measured
according to the list rules, which determine how high the value-based third-country
proportion of a product may be so that the ﬁnished product can still be declared as
an originating product eligible for preferential treatment.
To put it simply, the originating status of a ﬁnished product is based on the
maximum allowed percentage value of third-country precursor materials in com-
parison to the net value of the ﬁnished product in order for the ﬁnished product to
still qualify for preference.
If a preference agreement exists between the country of origin and the country of
destination, products eligible for preference can be exported to the country of
destination on a duty-free or low-customs-duty basis.
From a customs standpoint, such a preference agreement between nations of the
European Union and other countries or groups of countries thus represents prefer-
ential treatment for goods from particular countries. Under certain circumstances,
222
4
Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk, Compliance

it can offer exporters of products with originating status a competitive advantage,
since the ﬁnished product is not burdened with many, if any, customs fees.
Preferential character of an in-house produced air conditioner
A company with headquarters in Germany manufactures air conditioners.
The components for the ﬁnished product are procured internationally from
various suppliers. The air conditioners have an ex-factory price of €1,000.
According to HS (Harmonized System) Item 8,415, air conditioners made
with motorized fans are only permitted to have precursor materials procured
from foreign countries with a maximum value of 40%, so that the ﬁnished
product can still be declared as preferential originating goods. In our exam-
ple, the value of these materials amounts to a total of €400, meaning that
German originating status applies to the device.
Customs preferences are determined in the foreign trade component of SAP ERP
as follows:
1. First, a vendor declaration is requested.
2. The data from the vendor declaration is aggregated in the material master
records.
3. A preference calculation is performed to determine the origin of a material and
its eligibility for preference.
4. The preference results are used in the sales and distribution documents.
The determination of preferential treatment eligibility in SAP ERP is initially
performed on the basis of vendor declarations. The vendor declarations serve as a
document of information and certiﬁcation regarding the preference-based origin of
materials supplied by the vendor. Vendors are obligated to submit such declarations
if they are directly or indirectly involved in preferential goods trade between the EU
and other states.
Requesting and managing vendor declarations and the associated generation of
reminders are supported by the system. Vendor declarations can, for instance, be
requested on the basis of existing purchasing info records. Vendor declarations are
aggregated in the material master, where they set a preference indicator.
Preference determination uses preference indicators in the material master to
determine a preference condition and updates the preference indicator of the
materials. Per material and preference zone, the system generates a condition record
containing the determined preference price. Actual preference calculation is done
on the basis of a BOM explosion, in which the components and their origins are
determined, and the value of the precursor materials ﬂows into the calculation.
Figure 4.3 shows a view of the customs and preference data in the material master.
The results of preference determination are used in the sales documents because
the preference condition records are taken into account during the pricing proce-
dure. The system compares the sales price of a ﬁnished product with the preference
4.4
Foreign Trade Processing with SAP ERP
223

price. In order for a ﬁnished product to be accepted at customs as preferential, the
sales price of the product to be exported must be greater than its preference price.
The business transaction and sales price of a certain product thus individually
determine the preference validity of a sales product. As proof of validity of
preference in accordance with customs regulations, movement certiﬁcates and
evidence or certiﬁcates of origin are printed.
4.4.4
Documentary Payments
A letter of credit is a ﬁnancial document that is used when collateral is required for
a particular business transaction with a certain business partner. Generally, this
involves the exporting of goods in cases where the business partner’s headquarters
are in a foreign country. Documentary payments in foreign trade processing use
letters of credit for credit management, export credit insurance and as a collateral
instrument to minimize the risk involved in export business. Documentary payment
in SAP ERP is seamlessly integrated in the sales and distribution component SD.
This type of processing serves as conﬁrmation to the exporter of punctual and
complete payment, and also conﬁrms to the importer that the goods for which he
has paid are in fact the ones he has ordered. In addition, using a letter of credit
supplies conﬁrmation that the goods have been shipped.
Fig. 4.3 Foreign trade data and customs preferences in the material master
224

Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk, Compliance

Figure 4.4 shows an example of letter of credit processing, which can basically
be done as follows:
1. The customer, the importer of the goods, places an order at a company, in this
case the exporter. The sales agreement is established, and importer and exporter
exchange the sales order and order conﬁrmation. This conﬁrmation contains the
conditions to which this transaction is subject. In our case, the export sale is
secured by a letter of credit.
2. According to conditions, the customer, in his role as an importer, opens a letter
of credit at his ﬁrm’s bank.
3. This bank, also called the issuing bank, approves the letter of credit request and
opens a letter of credit to the beneﬁt of the exporter at a bank in the country of
the exporter and on behalf of the importer. The exporter’s bank in this case is
known as the advising bank.
4. The advising bank informs the exporter and forwards the letter of credit to him.
5. Through the opening of the letter of credit, the exporter acknowledges the
importer’s ability to pay, and ships the goods in observance of the conditions
stipulated in the letter of credit.
6. The documents related to shipping the goods are forwarded to the advising
bank along with the letter of credit.

7. The documents are veriﬁed by the bank, which subsequently makes the
stipulated payment to the exporter.
8. The advising bank sends the documents back to the issuing bank for payment.
9. In exchange for the shipping documents, the issuing bank negotiates payment
at the stipulated conditions with the importer.
10. These shipping documents are required for the importer to be able to take
possession of the goods.
4.4.5
Communication/Printing
The area of Communication/Printing supports foreign trade by printing ofﬁcial
foreign trade documents as well as through active interfaces for the dispatch of EDI
messages to customs ofﬁces and other government agencies.
The documents provided by SAP ERP comply with the requirements of Euro-
pean, American and Japanese authorities and need no further adaptation. Such
documents include commercial invoices, pro forma invoices, certiﬁcates of origin,
export packing lists, shipping notiﬁcations for the transport of goods between two
locations within a customs territory of the European Union and all foreign trade
documents, including those required by U.S. customs.
4.4.6
Periodic Declarations
Import and export transactions must be centrally declared to facilitate the recording
of goods trafﬁc between the member states of the European Union. These so-called
INTRASTAT and EXTRASTAT declarations ﬂow into central statistics and docu-
ment intracommunity trade.
Corresponding requirements also exist for Japan and states of the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as for the states of the European Free
Trade Association (EFTA). The ERP system supports employees in processing
foreign trade by generating these periodic payments, and offers the opportunity to
transmit the data required in the declarations as printed documents, discs or via EDI
or email.
4.5
Governance, Risk and Compliance with SAP
BusinessObjects Global Trade Services
SAP BusinessObjects Global Trade Services, a part of SAP BusinessObjects
Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) solutions, is an independent software
component with which you can monitor and control customs, foreign trade,
226
4
Trade Formalities: Governance, Risk, Compliance

conformity veriﬁcation and risk management processes in cooperation with SAP
ERP logistics processes.
SAP BusinessObjects Global Trade Services only requires the SAP NetWeaver
component for installation. Thus, it can be used independently on a separate
SAP system, as an integrated system component of an ERP system (in the same
or another client) as well as a subcomponent on any other SAP NetWeaver-based
SAP system. Technical integration with logistics processes running on one or
more ERP systems is achieved using interfaces that supply GTS with master and
transactional data.
4.5.1
General Process and Integration in SAP ERP
To begin process integration between SAP ERP logistics and SAP BusinessObjects
Global Trade Services, the required ERP master data must ﬁrst be transferred to the
GTS master database. This is done via an asynchronous master data transfer using
ALK (application link enabling) technology. The transferred master data includes
the following types:
•
ERP customer master data that is used in GTS as business partner master data.
Such data also includes organizational master data, which in GTS becomes
foreign trade organizations with user plants.
•
ERP vendor master data, which in GTS becomes business partner master data.
•
ERP material master data, which in GTS becomes product master data.
After the master data has been provided to SAP BusinessObjects Global Trade
Services, you can enhance these master data records with the corresponding foreign
trade, conformity and customs-related additional master data (see Fig. 4.5).
Process integration is generally achieved by transferring logistics document
data from the ERP system to GTS. Purchasing or sales documents are transferred
from ERP, undergo various tests in GTS and trigger the generation of a customs
document. This customs document can also be subjected to various tests. Its status
can be monitored and queried, and corresponding release or block information
ﬂows back to ERP logistics processes.
The ERP logistics documents and respective billing documents can be used to
generate a customs shipment document, which is used for customs declaration
purposes. Figure 4.5 shows the basic process of a conformity check and customs
declaration process.
The GTS user interface differs in the appearance of its main menu from the other
SAP logistics applications. Instead of the typical menu tree, all application areas
are accessible via buttons on the main menu screen. In Fig. 4.6, you can see the
GTS main menu with its functional areas Compliance Management, Customs
Management, Risk Management, Electronic Compliance Reporting and System
administration.

4.5.2
Compliance Management: Sanctioned Party List Check
Due to various events (such as the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001) in recent years,
measures for preventing commercial and ﬁnancial transactions that could enable
terrorist attacks (such as weapons trade and technology transfer) have become
considerably more strict. For instance, automatic checks against blacklists for
trade partners and embargo and boycott lists for countries have been established.
GTS supports implementation of these legal requirements in payment transactions
by enabling an automatic check of your master data against regularly published
blacklists (such as by the Ofﬁce of Foreign Asset Control in the United States, the
German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, and the EU). Test results can
then be used to prevent transactions with undesired trade partners, countries or
restricted products.
Figure 4.7 depicts the process of a sanctioned party list check. The business
partners indicated in the SAP ERP materials management and sales documents are
screened by the GTS component against existing sanctioned party lists (see 1 in
Fig. 4.7). You can obtain sanctioned party lists 2 from external sources (such as

authorized data suppliers) and load them into the GTS component via the XML
interface. You can also create your own lists and apply them in the checks.
Based on those lists, you can perform a periodic screening 3 of your business
partner database and, if necessary, identify a partner as blocked. The business
partners stored in GTS have an initial status of not screened when the data is
transferred. The sanctioned party list check is done through a comparison of the
addresses. Depending on the results, a business partner receives the status of
blocked or released for each list.
On the other hand, you can compare materials management documents
(purchasing, material and inbound delivery documents) and sales and distribution
documents (sales, outbound delivery, billing documents as well as the request for
quotation and the quotation itself) to the sanctioned party lists via integration of the
logistics documents with GTS 4. Periodic monitoring also allows you to subse-
quently release a blocked partner if a change has made this possible 5. Figure 4.8
shows the test result of a sanctioned party list check against the business partner
master.

When checking ﬁnancial transactions (incoming and outgoing payment documents),
SAP BusinessObjects Global Trade Services supports the checks cited below. If the
check results in a business partner being blocked, the entire transaction is prevented; this
is done in the following steps:
1. Comparison of the business partner master data, including the account holder,
with blacklists
2. Evaluation of the check results in the payment program
3. Check in the payment program to verify whether the country of the payment
recipient or payer is subject to an embargo
4. Check of the application of funds by GTS in the payment program

The following section provides an overview of the functions of import/export
control.
4.5.3
Compliance Management: Import/Export Control
Foreign trade laws strictly regulate the import and export of goods. Such laws
include arms control and drug laws, embargo and other regulations. Frequently,
licenses are required for import or export to ensure smooth processing. For instance,
in the United States, the Department of Commerce, Department of State, the Food
and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration enforce exten-
sive license requirements. GTS can support you in this area with its Import/Export
Control, by providing clear information on existing licenses and embargo
regulations.
To enable efﬁcient screening, the goods to be moved must ﬁrst be classiﬁed. For
this, you can assign all goods and products commodity codes, export list numbers or
other country-speciﬁc codes. You can also do a key word or phonetic search for a
corresponding number. Import and export lists can also be imported as ﬁles that you
can obtain from data suppliers.
To determine the relevant licenses, you can maintain a search strategy in GTS.
You can then run a check of your import or export deliveries in order to ensure that
the import or export conforms to the laws of the respective country. For exports, the
regulations pertaining to the importing country apply, and for imports, those of
the exporting country. The actual check is generally based on a combination of the
parameters export list number, country of destination, country group, individual
products, customer data, goods quantities and values.
Figure 4.9 shows an overview of the function menu provided by GTS for the
execution of various export control areas.

Figure 4.10 shows the process of an import and export control. The documents
generated in logistics for the processing of imported or exported goods can be
transmitted to GTS to check for relevant licenses and embargos (see 1 in Fig. 4.10).
When a check ends with a positive result, a release of the documents occurs in SAP
ERP 2. The quantities and values for the licensed imports or exports are updated in
GTS, enabling you to have an overview of the contingent currently in use 3.

Customs Management
The GTS Customs Management offers functions that support cross-border goods
ﬂow with regard to customs authorities. GTS support of electronic customs decla-
ration and shipping procedures prevents unnecessary delays and thus aids in saving
time and costs.
The Customs Processing Import/Export cockpit offers a variety of functions,
such as:
•
The display of import and export activities
•
The determination of customs status
•
Monitoring of reimport lists and export conﬁrmations
•
Manual customs declaration before and after goods receipt
•
Entry of supplementary customs declarations
•
Monitoring of logistics processes, execution of inventory posting and accessing
of stock lists.
The array of functions is based on comprehensive product duty information and
duty classiﬁcation characteristics, which can be maintained as a supplement to the
material master.

customs duty rates and other classiﬁcation characteristics. Of course, you can also
import the codes and tariff data to GTS from compatible sources instead of making
manual entries.
After updating tariffs, tariff characteristics and rules, you can perform operative
customs processes:
•
Electronic customs declaration process
•
Printing of trade documents for the import and export of goods
•
Customs duties calculations
GTS is ready for communication with the customs authorities of several countries.
In a few cases, electronic communication is available via direct SAP interfaces, and in
other cases you also need an EDI converter and adapter that are linked via SAP
NetWeaver Process Integration (SAP NetWeaver PI). There are also certiﬁed SAP
partners who offer such options as supplementary modules for conversion of GTS
interfaces to ANSI X.12 601/824 document interfaces of the Automated Export
Systems (AES), made available by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.
4.5.5
Risk Management
The area of Risk Management in GTS includes the functions for preference
processing, letter of credit processing and for export refunds for EU-market-
regulations goods.
With SAP GTS, you can use preference advantages and avoid problems related
to violating free trade agreements such as NAFTA or the EU most favored nation
agreement. Figure 4.12 shows the primary structure of preference processing.
With GTS Preference Processing (see the function menu in Fig. 4.13), you can
efﬁciently obtain the necessary vendor declarations from your vendors and manage
them. This can be very complicated without system support, since you have to
individually determine the origin of all components used in an end product,
especially for extensive bills of material with semi-ﬁnished products of various
foreign manufacturers.

With SAP BusinessObjects Global Trade Services, you can obtain vendor
declarations in several ways:
•
Forms that can be individually tailored
•
Internet-based self-services for vendors
•
Fully automatic process using SAP NetWeaver PI
After obtaining the vendor declarations, you can aggregate the data and store it
in the material master of the product. Subsequently, you can perform a preference
calculation, even for complex products such as automobiles and computer systems,
with the automatic use of preference rules and the ofﬁcial origin rules.

Letter of credit processing supports you in risk minimization when you need to
do foreign trade business with ﬁnancial documents such as letters of credit, collec-
tion or guarantees, and wish to manage these documents. Import- and export-related
letters of credit are supported and can be allocated to individual transactions.
Automatic testing lets you block documents for further processing in risk situations.

Chapter 5
Controlling and Reporting
Controlling logistics processes and the subsequent provision of assessments and
reports are signiﬁcant supplementary functions for the efﬁcient organization and
execution of all kinds of supply chain activities.
To conclude this book, we explain SAP Event Management, SAP Auto-ID
Infrastructure, SAP Object Event Repository and SAP NetWeaver BW. All of
these components enable you to maintain an overview of your processes and keep
them under control.
5.1
SAP Event Management (SAP EM)
Universal tool to monitor events: SAP Event Management is a universal, adaptable
tool for deﬁning visibility, status tracking and tracing processes, imputing perfor-
mance data using your own or partner processes, and integrating these processes in
your application systems.
SAP Event Management provides ﬂexible support for achieving your process
and object status tracking needs. Because there are no “prefabricated”, purpose-
speciﬁc business objects in Event Management (such as sales orders), you can
conﬁgure suitable object types, process steps and reactions in order to model and
construct status processes that are precisely tailored to your requirements.
Event Management has become the standard system for tracking and tracing
within SAP logistics. Thus, several logistics processes come pre-conﬁgured for use
with SAP Event Management.

5.1.1
Basic Characteristics of SAP EM
5.1.1.1
Event Handlers
The primary objects in Event Management are called event handlers (EH). They
enable the tracking of individual status processes and the deﬁnition of their
characteristics. An event handler can represent a material good or object, such as
one of the following elements:
•
A pallet used as packaging for a goods shipment to be tracked (speciﬁcally, the
goods are of interest, not the pallet)
•
A container that is tracked as an asset during the entire period of possession
•
A machine whose function is monitored and recorded
•
A shipment (such as an express package) that is traced from pick-up to drop-off
You can also track a process or non-material event, such as:
•
A purchase order that proceeds through various processing statuses
•
A payment procedure intended to lead to the settlement of an invoice
•
An order generated by you, from the requisition to delivery
5.1.1.2
Event Handler Lifecycle
One thing that all event handlers have in common is the presence of a lifecycle:
Event handlers are created through a certain procedure, after which they exist for a
time and are subsequently deactivated by a particular event. The EH lifecycle can
be of varying length. Event handlers can process a large number of events. Table 5.1
shows three examples of typical data for the lifecycle of an event handler.
High performance and speed
SAP Event Management is designed to process extensive scenarios and large
amounts of data. Several large postal companies use SAP Event Management
for package tracking, with several billion event messages per year.
During the lifecycle of an event handler, many different types of events can
occur. These are depicted in Fig. 5.1:

5.1.1.3
Event Types
Let us take a closer look at the various types of events along the lifecycle:
1. Regular event
This event is known as a process milestone either in the application system or
during a process, and is stored in Event Management as an expected event. This
event can occur during a deﬁned period of time. The current event occurs within
that deﬁned period, as expected.
Example: A goods shipment is to be delivered between 10 a.m. and 12 a.m.,
and is delivered at 11:33 a.m.
2. Premature or overdue event
As in the case of a regular event, an expectation deﬁnition exists, but the event
occurs either too early or too late. The deviation is registered in Event Manage-
ment but does not necessarily lead to exception reactions.
Example: An invoice is to be paid by March 30 but is not paid until April 1.
3. Unexpected event
This event is not known to the system as a process milestone, but it happens
nevertheless. It can either represent a status or an exception.
Example: A railway car passes the control center in Boston (status), or a truck
breaks down on the highway with engine trouble (exception).
4. Non-reported event
As in the case of a regular or non-delayed event, an expectation deﬁnition exists,
but the current event does not occur upon expiration of the expected time period.
Because it is not known whether the physical event has not occurred or whether
it has simply not been reported, exception handling is initiated as soon as the
deadline has been reached.

An example is a message pertaining to a delivery that a service provider must
issue within 8 h after delivery. If the service provider does not report the
delivery, it does not matter whether he has made the delivery or not, since the
measurement criterion is the timely provision of the information (for instance, to
facilitate the timely issue of an invoice).
5.1.1.4
Logistics Processes and Event Management
Below, a few logistic processes and process variants are cited that SAP clients from
various branches monitor with SAP Event Management. The corresponding
solutions for that branch are also indicated:
•
Bid invitation and visibility for logistics execution (high-tech and electronics
industry; SAP for High Tech)
•
Handling unit tracking in output logistics processes (logistics service providers;
SAP for Transportation & Logistics)
•
Sales and distribution processes in a distributed environment (manufacturing
industry; SAP for Industrial Machinery & Components)
•
International sea freight, including customs declaration (wholesale and retail;
SAP for Retail)
•
Integration with a vehicle management system, returns processing (automotive
industry; SAP for Automotive)
•
Replacement part and tool management (air and space industry; SAP for Aero-
space & Defense)
•
Tracking of individual packages, including nested loading (postal branch; SAP
for Transportation & Logistics)
•
Order processing, including production monitoring, delivery and invoicing,
railway car management (chemical industry, metal, wood and paper industries;
SAP for Chemicals, SAP for Mill Products)
•
Integration with the Traders and Schedulers Workbench (oil and gas industry;
SAP for Oil & Gas)
5.1.1.5
Event Management Processes
Generally, an Event Management process is started in an application system.
Figure 5.2 shows the Event Management process ﬂow and an overview of the
functions of Event Management.
5.1.1.6
Process Flow Phases
The process proceeds through several phases. First, the underlying object, such as a
shipping document, is generated in the application system. If it is relevant to Event
Management, data pertaining to tracking is extracted from the document and sent to
242
5
Controlling and Reporting

Event Management, where a corresponding event handler is generated. When event
messages are received, the corresponding event handler in Event Management is
determined, and the events are processed with the aid of the rule type. In doing so,
actions such as the sending of messages or actions in the application system can be
triggered. Using the Report Manager, you can display the status data and history of
event handlers.
5.1.2
Application Interface
5.1.2.1
Integrating SAP Applications
The Application Interface provides a uniform basis for the integration of all SAP
applications with Event Management. It is a component of SAP NetWeaver. Based
on its conﬁguration options, you can control right from an application how Event
Management is to be executed for an object or process.
5.1.2.2
Content-Based Signiﬁcance of a Business Object
In many cases, the application and business object (such as a shipping document)
themselves do not indicate much about the content-based signiﬁcance of a process.

SAP Event Management (SAP EM)
243

In SAP systems, this signiﬁcance often only becomes apparent through a variety of
control parameters, such as document types. A shipment document that represents
a consolidated road transport, for instance, is tracked in a different way than a
shipment document for a full container designated as sea freight. Only through the
transportation type of a shipment document and the existence of a handling unit of
the type Container does the type of transport and how it is to be tracked become
apparent. The event handler is generated accordingly.
There is usually one business process type for every application object. This
business process type, used in the application system and in Event Management, is
a rough categorization of processes that are supported (such as purchase order,
shipment or sales order tracking).
5.1.2.3
Application Objects
The content-based characteristics of a business object are called application objects
in the Application Interface and in Event Management (examples are container sea
freight shipment, dangerous goods road transport and a retail shipment).
Creating application objects
For the business process type Shipment, for instance, you can create various
application objects (such as container shipment, air freight, dangerous goods
shipment, express shipment, etc.), all of which lead to various event manage-
ment processes even though they were generated from a business object of the
same type (with one ERP shipment document).
You can also deﬁne on which application object level the application objects are
to be established. For example, you can either track an entire shipment or generate a
separate event handler for individual packages of a shipment and track them on the
package level.
5.1.2.4
Data Extraction for Event Handlers
The application interface extracts various data for the establishment of an event
handler that is forwarded to Event Management:
•
Tracking IDs and code sets
These are identiﬁcation numbers such as a shipment number, container number
or order number.
•
Control and info data
The data extractors identify important ﬁeld contents of application objects, such
as the sender and recipient of a shipment, the description of the goods or the
name of the driver.
244
5
Controlling and Reporting

•
Query IDs
These are identiﬁcation numbers that are only used to query information (such as
a customer order number).
•
Expected events
These are milestones that represent the process ﬂow, such as loading date,
dispatch, arrival or unloading date.
5.1.2.5
Creating Event Types
You can create event types for a business process type. They deﬁne events that take
place in the application system within the context of an application business
transaction and, from there, are reported as events to Event Management (for
instance, you can set the loading status for a shipment within shipment processing).
Data is also extracted from the application context in order to report events, and it is
added to the event message to be sent.
5.1.3
Event Handlers and Event Messages
The event handler is a universally applicable business object that can represent all
status and tracking processes in Event Management. It can represent an individual
process or object, or a set of objects from different perspectives. An event handler
contains a great deal of data that can be individually calibrated for a process with
the proper settings. The following data is available for the calibration and control of
an event handler:
•
Event handler header and system parameters
The header contains control data and references to the application object.
•
Tracking IDs
Tracking IDs and their tracking code sets serve to allocate event messages to an
event handler. When the tracking ID of an event message matches an event
handler, the event is processed by that event handler.
•
Status attribute proﬁles and values
The status can be saved with a single- or multiple-value calibration and an initial
value for any purpose. For example, you can deﬁne a shipment status that
can assume the values “Waiting for dispatch”, “In transit” or “Arrived”. The
statuses and their values can be deﬁned freely.
•
Data container
Data containers enable you to save any information on a process or underlying
business object.
•
Expected events
Events that are deﬁned as process milestones for the event handler can be stored
as expected events.
5.1
SAP Event Management (SAP EM)
245

•
Reported events
If an event message is received for an event handler, a reported event is
generated from it. It can either be expected or refer to an unexpected event.
•
Rules
The rule set serves to process events and react to expected and unexpected
events.
•
Queries
Queries can be used to determine status and event handler data.
5.1.3.1
Mapping Parameters
When an event handler is created, the event handler type is ﬁrst determined. Then,
the transferred parameters of the application system are mapped in the Event
Management parameters. This allows for a uniform display of data from various
applications. This can be necessary if, for instance, various application systems are
used for the same process, which is frequently the case in large companies with
“expanded” IT system environments.
5.1.3.2
Event Handler Settings
The basic settings for the characteristics of an event handler are deﬁned through the
event handler type and associated proﬁles. The event handler type determines
the generation, construction and behavior of an event handler. You can adjust the
following settings for an event handler type:
•
The rule set determines how the event handler reacts to incoming event
messages.
•
A status attribute proﬁle generates one or more status ﬁelds in the event handler,
each with an initial value and a permissible attribute value list.
•
The extended event proﬁle (EE proﬁle) determines which expected events are
generated and from where the respective dates are derived.
•
The extension table ID deﬁnes a table with which additional event handler
parameters can be saved so you can ﬁnd them quickly and easily with a search
query.
•
The BW proﬁle determines which data from an event handler is to be extracted
for transfer to the Business Warehouse.
5.1.3.3
Expected Event Proﬁle
In an event handler, the expected events are generated on the basis of an expected
event proﬁle. This proﬁle lists all expected events that can occur (such as a dispatch,
arrival or inbound delivery conﬁrmation). You can consolidate expected events into
246
5
Controlling and Reporting

groups. For instance, you can create a group in which only one event must occur in
order to acknowledge the conﬁrmation for the entire group. Expected events are
created from the following data sources:
•
Application object milestones
Milestone data can be extracted from an application object (for instance, a
delivery date). There are also events that can occur several times in several
places (such as an arrival event for every end location of a shipment stage).
•
Events can be determined in Event Management
Events are generated in Event Management in relation to one another (for
example, an end-of-loading event deﬁned to occur a maximum of 2 h after the
start of loading).
•
Events from non-SAP systems
Events can be retrieved from non-SAP systems or determined using Web
services.
For every event, you can deﬁne an earliest and a latest event date (or
corresponding time of day) as well as an earliest and latest possible message
transmission date (or time). Thus, exception handling can take place for an overdue
event as well as for a delayed message if it lies outside the deﬁned time period.
5.1.3.4
Flexible Status Attributes
The status attribute proﬁle offers the opportunity to allocate one or more status
ﬁelds to an event handler. They are ﬁlled with an initial value (initial status) when
the event handler is generated. You can perform activities during event handling to
alter status attributes.
Events change status attributes
A departure event, for instance, can be used to set the shipping status deﬁned
in an event handler from Not started to In transit, and a subsequent arrival
event could then set the status to Arrived.
For every status attribute, you can save a list of permissible status values.
5.1.4
Event Handling
5.1.4.1
Flow of Event Handling
Event reports can occur at any time, even before the corresponding event handler
exists. Events do not get lost, and as soon as an active event handler exists with a
5.1
SAP Event Management (SAP EM)
247

suitable tracking ID, the event is processed by it. The following steps are
performed:
1. The event is ﬁrst saved in the database.
2. The event handler is determined and the event is forwarded for further
processing.
3. The event is saved as an unexpected event or with reference to an expected event
in the event handler.
4. An appropriate rule for event handling is sought. If one is found, all actions
deﬁned within it are performed.
5.1.4.2
Rule Sets for Event Handling
Rule processing is based on rule sets, which can contain several rules. Each rule is
composed of a condition and actions that are executed depending on the conformity
or non-conformity of the conditions. A rule (condition/action), for example, could
look something like this: Verify whether the arrival at the destination port has
occurred more than 12 h late. If so, send an informational email to the goods
recipient. Figure 5.3 shows the principle structure of a rule set.
5.1.4.3
Jump Targets in Rule Sets
For every rule, there is also a deﬁnition of where within the rule set the action
processing is to continue. For example, if a condition is evaluated to be TRUE and

By double-clicking an entry in the event handler list, you can access the Event
Handler Overview. Here, you can view consolidated and expected events, event
messages, error messages and status details. Status details also indicate any status
change history.
When you select the Detail Overview, you arrive at the internal view of the event
handler, in which you can access all event handler data and the complete history.
Figure 5.5 shows the Event Handler Overview with an event list and Detail

steps are listed, including a time stamp of the execution and process status.
5.1.6
Data Entry for Event Messages
5.1.6.1
Conﬁgurable Hand-Held Scanner User Interface
A conﬁgurable user interface is available for the integration of a hand-held scanner.
It enables you to scan objects (such as pallets) and send a predeﬁned event to Event
Management with each scan (for instance, a goods receipt for pallets including
information on the processing employee, location and date and time).
In the event that a user is only authorized to conﬁrm expected events, a
transaction for event conﬁrmation can be used. When the tracking ID is entered,
all expected events are listed, and you can enter the event date and time, time zone
and a reason for any deviance in time.

5.1.7
Web Interface
5.1.7.1
Conﬁgurable Web Interface
In Event Management, you can deﬁne Web interface transactions and allocate them
to users or roles. These transactions can be accessed with any Internet browser. You
can deﬁne the following proﬁles for each transaction:
•
User proﬁle
The user proﬁle contains the name of the proﬁle and the allocation of selection,
display and event message proﬁles. The user proﬁle is ultimately allocated to a
user role.
•
Selection proﬁle
This proﬁle contains the conﬁguration of ﬁelds that are available as selection
ﬁelds.
•
Display proﬁle
The display proﬁle enables the deﬁnition of parameters that are to be displayed
in the event handler details and the columns of the event lists.
•
Event message proﬁle
This proﬁle is used to deﬁne which event messages a user can acknowledge and
what additional data he can enter.
Web interface versions
In Event Management – depending on the release version – there are two
different versions of the Web interface. Up to and including Release EM 5.0
(SCM 5.0), a Java version is available (Java Server Pages Technology) that is
executed on the SAP NetWeaver Java stack. This has been replaced by a Web
Dynpro ABAP version in Release EM 5.1.
Figure 5.6 shows the user view of the Web interface when it invokes a transac-
tion with the role of Shipper.
Above, you can see selection ﬁelds for the event handler. The upper section

to ERP and TM processes, you can also view those of automatic identiﬁcation
(Auto-ID) and Supply Network Collaboration (SNC).
For logistics processes in SAP ERP, there are several visibility processes based
on various business objects or process chains.
5.1.8.2
Fulﬁllment
In the Fulﬁllment area, there is an EM process that begins with the creation of a
sales order and then makes delivery processing and subsequent shipment visible.
The scheduling of shipment documents containing sales order delivery data triggers
the generation of an event handler that includes delivery events (such as picking and
packing) as well as transport events and the delivery status.
In the data warehouse SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver
BW), performance ﬁgures are updated regarding execution and reporting quality of
the respective service provider and the duration of transportation.
5.1.8.3
Order Processing
In the area of Order Processing, you can track the status of an order. If order items
exist that are relevant to tracking, the system generates an event handler with which
the order conﬁrmation, shipping notiﬁcation, goods receipt or payment can be
controlled. In SAP NetWeaver BW, for instance, key ﬁgures regarding cycle time
between an order and conﬁrmation, conﬁrmation and shipping notiﬁcation, or
notiﬁcation and goods receipt are updated to allow you to perform intermediate
and in-house performance controls.
5.1.8.4
Production Error Handling
The production error handling process is based on a production order that leads to
the generation of an event handler. If a production procedure is interrupted by a
machine malfunction and a corresponding error notiﬁcation is created, you can
monitor the progress of error elimination. BW integration enables you to access
statistics on the frequency of production interruptions and thus to evaluate the

RFI-Enabled Transport Packaging Tracking
If your company uses returnable transport packaging and RFID technology (radio
frequency identiﬁcation) to label and identify containers, you can employ the
RFID-enabled returnable transport item (RTI) processing. This process works
with SAP Event Management as well as the Auto-ID Infrastructure, which serves
5.1
SAP Event Management (SAP EM)
253

to evaluate the label or tag data supplied by the RFID reader (see also Sect. 5.2,
“Auto-ID Infrastructure and Object Event Repository”). The process starts with the
description of the RFID tags and includes the events loading, unloading at the
customer and return from the customer.
5.1.8.6
EM Standard Processes for SAP TM
The standard issue of SAP Transportation Management offers the possibility of
having SAP Event Management perform status tracking for important process
steps. This support can be activated for individual business objects or process
steps, and can be controlled in a higher granularity using document types.
Event Management and the interface between it and SAP TM can be conﬁgured
and expanded, such that practically any standard status tracking scenario can be
mapped. The standard version of SAP TM offers ﬁve scenarios and integration
points:
5.1.8.7
SAP TM: Order Status Tracking
Shipping order status tracking, the ﬁrst of these processes, provides information to
the sold-to party regarding the current processing status. In order status tracking, no
planned events are deﬁned; instead, the current events related to status changes of
the shipping inquiry are entered.
5.1.8.8
SAP TM: Shipment Tracking
To track the status of an individual TM shipment, shipment tracking – the second
important process – is done on the basis of shipment data, and begins as soon as a
shipment has received the status Ready for shipping. The planned transportation
activities of the shipment are then used to generate the expected events for the
arrival of the carrier, loading and unloading, etc. The events loading, unloading,
departure and arrival can occur more than once, depending on the number of
shipment stages and transfer points a shipment has (see Fig. 5.8).
A reported event for the expected events leads to the generation of an executed
transport activity in SAP TM. Unexpected events can include late deliveries,
customs receipt and issue, load splitting and blocking.
Figure 5.8 shows the interplay of transport request status tracking and shipment
tracking. Figure 5.9 illustrates the process integration between the shipping process
in TM and shipment tracking in Event Management.

Controlling and Reporting

5.1.8.9
SAP TM: Vehicle and Transport Equipment Tracking
The third important process is vehicle and transport equipment tracking. The
tracking process is triggered based on a TM resource, that is, as soon as a resource
is created in the master data that is relevant to tracking and tracing (such as a
container), a respective event handler is generated. The event handler for the
resource has no expected events, but can register an extremely large number of
unexpected events throughout a lifecycle. Events that are traced include departures,
arrivals, damage and the allocation and decoupling of tours.
5.1.8.10
SAP TM: Tour Status Tracking
Tour status tracking, the fourth process, aids in tracking tours from the perspective
of punctuality and the planned tour steps. Its goal is to inform business partners and
service providers of the status of a tour. Based on planned transport activities, all
trip and arrival events of a tour are determined and set in the tour event handler as
expected events. Unexpected events that can be registered in this regard include any
delays reported by the carrier, blocks and any reported omissions of locations (such
as port omissions).
5.1.8.11
SAP TM: Automatic RFQ Tracking Process
The last important process is the RFQ tracking process, pertaining to requests for bid
quotations. It serves to automatically monitor the bidding procedure and track
reactions and reply times of service providers for the tendering of shipment requests.

The event handler for the tendering process is generated individually from each
request for supplier quotations, meaning that every service provider to whom a
quotation is allocated is tracked separately. The momentary RFQ status is registered,
the bidding process is automatically terminated at the set deadline, and the reaction
behavior toward new tenders of the queried service providers is evaluated.
5.1.8.12
Expected Events and Event Groups
The event handler for the tracking of RFQs contains the following expected events:
•
Transmission of the request for quotation to the service provider:
Generation of a document that conﬁrms that the request has been sent.
•
Receipt of a reply from a service provider:
The reply receipt is an event group that can have four event characteristics:

made by the service provider) and Rejected (no answer from the service pro-
vider); each of these four events leads to the fulﬁllment of the expected receipt
for that event group.
•
End of reply receipt:
This event is checked by an alert monitor for expected events; if up to that point
no reply has been received, the RFQ is automatically with-drawn.
•
End of RFQ (occurs automatically after a period of 2 weeks if no service
provider has been commissioned based on the RFQ).
•
Quotation selection:
If several quotations are received, the operator can select the most economical
option.
•
Acceptance of the quotation and order placement with the service:
The operator conﬁrms the selected quotation with the service provider.
The ability to individually control each quotation enables the bid invitation
process to be conducted with several service providers (broadcast) and set varying
deadlines for individual service providers. This lets you “reward” reliable or pre-
ferred service providers with an extended deadline. If a deadline for a tendering
procedure has passed and a quotation has not been accepted or accepted with
changes, SAP TM automatically starts the next planned tendering procedure for
the shipment or freight order.
Figure 5.10 shows an overview of two RFQ event handlers. For the ﬁrst EH, a
reply from a service provider has not yet been received. That is why the event list

still displays the event group Receive Response. For the second event handler, the
service provider has already accepted, so the event group has been replaced by the
actually reported event Accept.
5.1.8.13
Constructing Your Own Tracking Scenarios
You can expand the standard tracking processes between the SAP application
systems (such as ERP or TM) and SAP Event Management and construct new
scenarios with Event Management. In addition, existing scenarios can be expanded
by a customer’s own process steps to achieve a higher degree of automation.
The following expansion options are available:
•
Expansion of business process types for the transmission of previously unpro-
cessed application data to the application interface.
•
Deﬁnition of additional application object types for tracking objects of a previ-
ously unmonitored type (such as a refrigerated container in a shipment or a
packing unit of the type roller container in a shipment order for express goods)
•
Deﬁnition of additional extractors and relevance conditions, so that you can
extract other or more extensive data from business project objects of application
systems, in order to ﬁll parameters or expected events in Event Management;
you can also access the data of other objects.
•
Your own event handler type, to enable you to deﬁne your own complete
visibility processes that represent the characteristics of a monitored object or
process and save the related data.
•
Expansion of rule sets, to change or augment reactions to existing or additional
events.
•
Expansion of EM-triggered control functions in the application system, in order to
be able to control additional processes from EM integration, such as to automati-
cally generate invoices for sea freight once the ship has left the source port.
5.2
Auto-ID Infrastructure and Object Event Repository
Increased Use of RFID: For the past few years in logistics, there has been increased
use of RFID technology (radio frequency identiﬁcation), which is gradually
replacing the barcode as a contact-free identiﬁcation means in several processes.
Because of its high costs and lack of standards, RFID was initially only used in
special production and logistics processes, such as in automobile production or in
the sales and distribution of high-priced goods (like hanging garments). Great
strides in standardization (such as EPCglobal) and consistently falling prices
for RFID identiﬁcation chips (RFID tags) have led to this technology also
being employed for bulk commodities (for instance, in the retail branch). In the
realm of access control, many people have already had direct contact with RFID
258

Controlling and Reporting

systems – for example, when using ski lift passes. With its Auto-ID Infrastructure
and Event-Management-based Object Event Repository, SAP offers you two efﬁ-
cient software components to support logistics processes using RFID technology.
5.2.1
Basics of RFID and EPC Technology
5.2.1.1
Advantages of RFID Technology
RFID technology has a few signiﬁcant advantages in comparison to the widely used
barcode system:
•
Tags do not have to be visible
RFID enables the identiﬁcation of logistical units for which, in contrast to a
barcode, no direct visibility of the RFID is required. The tag can also be read
from any direction.
•
Several tags can be read simultaneously
Efﬁcient anti-collision algorithms enable rapid, virtually parallel reading of a
large number of RFID tags.
•
Tags are scannable from within packages
RFID tags can be used in rough environmental conditions. Unlike a barcode, the
tag can also be integrated in packaging to prevent damage.
•
Tags can be inscribed
RFID tags can be read as well as inscribed. This enables data enhancement on
the tag within the course of the logistics process. The amount of data that can be
stored on an RFID tag is relatively large.
•
Reusability
RFID tags can be reused.
These characteristics make it proﬁtable to use RFID technology along the entire
logistics chain. For example, a product can be supplied with a tag as early as the
production phase. Warehousing, transportation to distribution centers, subsequent
picking and placing, and sales and distribution can be completely recorded by
scanning the RFID tag. This allows you to obtain precise data on the logistics chain.
5.2.1.2
Components of RFID Technology
An RFID system consists of several components that have to work well together.
Figure 5.11 shows the basic structure:
•
RFID tags/transponder/chips
An RFID tag in its simplest form consists of an antenna coil, a chip and a
permanent memory unit. The antenna coil receives radio waves from a reader
antenna and thus produces electricity that “wakes up” the chip and makes it upload
5.2
Auto-ID Infrastructure and Object Event Repository
259

the contents of its memory and transmit it in coded form via the tag’s antenna.
This “answer” from the tag can be received by the reader antenna and relayed.
There are various types of tags. Some of the characteristics named above can be
combined in a tag:
– Passive tags do not have their own current supply and are fed by the
electricity produced by the antenna, as described above.
– Active tags have a battery or rechargeable battery and do not need an outside
source of current. They are larger than passive tags and are primarily used for
the identiﬁcation of containers and railway cars.
– Read-only tags have a programmed identiﬁcation code in a read-only mem-
ory (such as an EPC, or Electronic Product Code), which can be scanned as
often as needed.
– Write-once tags do not come with an identiﬁcation code, but have a code
programmed into their write-once memories when their identiﬁcation is
deﬁned (for example, when a serial number is issued for a device to which
the tag is attached).
Reusable tags can be used repeatedly, that is, deleted and written over with
new data. The data can also be enhanced during the process, so that for each process
step, the progress can be recorded as data on the tag. The memory used for this
purpose is similar to the ﬂash memory of a USB stick.
•
Reader antenna
The antenna or antennas of the reader transmit a signal in a frequency
synchronized with the tag that stimulates the tag to transmit identiﬁcation and
other data. After the read signal has been sent, the antennas switch to reception
mode so they can receive the tag’s response. There are several frequency ranges
around the world in which RFID antennas operate. Because of dissimilar,
country-speciﬁc laws, it has not yet been possible to achieve complete synchro-
nization. In the realm of logistics, antennas in the decimeter wave band are used

(433 MHz, 869 MHz, 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz). In addition to legal regulations,
frequency selection also strongly depends on the operational environment (for
example, strongly metallic environments such as storage racks or the presence of
shielding objects such as ﬁlled chemical canisters).
•
Reader
The reader activates the antennas and decodes the data sent back by the tag. It
must know the initialization sequence required by the tag to send data back, and
it must understand the code in the data transmitted by the tag and convert it to the
proper data format required by the underlying logistics system. Reading devices
are available as permanently installed standing, wall or gate units. For mobile
applications, there are also a number of RFID hand readers that are at least
equipped with a display.
5.2.1.3
Specialized Systems
The component characteristics discussed above highlight the fact that despite
improvements, the use of RFID technology in logistics is challenging. The individ-
ual components, operational environment and material characteristics of the objects
to be identiﬁed need to be synchronized for successful implementation.
5.2.1.4
EPCglobal
To achieve a logistics standard in identiﬁcation processes using RFID, the Auto-ID
Center was established in the United States (and is now known as EPCglobal, see
www.epcglobalus.org), which promotes RFID tag standards and has deﬁned a
standardized identiﬁcation code, the Electronic Product Code (EPC).
5.2.1.5
Electronic Product Code (EPC)
The EPC was developed to create a means of identifying all kinds of physical
objects. Of course, it was also designed to include coverage of popular industry
norms such as EAN-UCC (European Article Number/Uniform Code Council),
GTIN (Global Trade Identiﬁcation Number) and SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Con-
tainer Code). Right from the start, the code was conceived as being expandable, to
be able to cover future applications. The Auto-ID standards are based on a
minimal amount of data on the chip (only the EPC code) and centralized or
distributed storage of the data and information linked to the physical object on
server systems (called EPCIS, Electronic Product Code Information Systems).
This enables you to keep costs for RFID tags as low as possible, making mass
application reasonable in terms of price. Figure 5.12 shows an example for a 96-
bit EPC.
5.2
Auto-ID Infrastructure and Object Event Repository
261

5.2.1.6
EPC Components
The EPC comprises several components:
•
Code type (header)
Classiﬁcation of the EPC version and information type (such as SGTIN:
Serialized Global Trade Identiﬁcation Number), deﬁnition of the unit type
(such as pallet code) and total code length
•
EPC manager
Assigned EPC member number of the number generator, such as a food product
manufacturer
•
Object class
Object number, such as the item number of a product from the food product
manufacturer named above (for example, honey-glazed ham slices)
•
Serial number
Identiﬁcation number of each individual object, such as a single package of
honey-glazed ham slices
This structure enables the logistics process to track and identify each item. If, for
instance, the honey-glazed ham slices are located in the refrigerated section of a
supermarket and scanned with an RFID reader, the EPCIS would allow you to
access the entire lifecycle of that package of meat. This facilitates very efﬁcient
quality control efforts.

5.2.2.1
Link Between Logistics Applications and RFID Tags
Between the world of process-oriented logistics applications and that of identiﬁca-
tion- and event-oriented RFID tags, a discrepancy exists with regard to the granu-
larity in which process steps are carried out.
RFID reading processes have the following basic characteristics:
•
Large amounts of real-time data with low data content (for instance, only the
identiﬁcation number) are generated and transmitted by readers.

•
A lack of contextual knowledge about the object or overall process: An object
goes through an isolated process step. For the scanning process, no contextual
knowledge is available about other connected objects (such as which other
cartons belong to a delivery).
•
Reading procedures are insufﬁciently standardized: Several tag and encoding
variants can hamper data interpretation.
The following problems must be addressed in logistics applications:
•
There is a certain degree of inability to interpret large amounts of very detailed real-
time data: A delivery with a pallet of 1,000 yogurt cups may produce performance
problems if each individual cup is posted to the goods issue via RFID.
•
Many business processes do not require data on the RFID-tag level: For the
above delivery, it is only important to know when the pallet was posted to goods
issue and how many cups were on it.
•
Several business process objects are not designed to process and store detailed
information and a history of all logistics objects used.
•
There are no direct interfaces to RFID readers available.
Based on these discrepancies, the Auto-ID Infrastructure was developed that
builds a bridge between the granular event processing of the RFID world and the
bundled view of logistics applications. Figure 5.13 illustrates this issue.

5.2.2.2
Process Examples of RFID Use
In the realm of logistics, there are a few typical processes in which the use of RFID
technology has proved especially effective. These include:
•
Handling unit packing and unpacking
In this process, a handling unit is generated with the aid of RFID technology. By
scanning the individual item objects and the container, the objects are allocated
to a handling unit. A logistics system is thus capable of generating the handling
unit based on the RFID information. The Auto-ID Infrastructure collects the
information regarding which object is packed into which container and then
creates a handling unit with content in the SAP system.The process can also be
performed if the individual items are directly supplied with tags on the produc-
tion line. This occurs frequently in the pharmaceutical industry, where expensive
medicine packages are tagged and placed into a container.
•
Content veriﬁcation of an HU using RFID
A known handling unit is checked using an RFID scan to verify its original
condition. Without having to be opened, the medicine carton mentioned above
can be checked to verify whether all individual packages are still in the box. This
process is often used for quality and theft control.
•
Loading and unloading of items and shipping containers
The RFID scan can provide you with a complete overview of the loaded or
unloaded items and shipping containers and automatically post them to goods
issue or receipt. This can either be done using a hand-held device or a perma-
nently installed scanner.
•
Loading sequence check
Using a permanently installed gate reader, you can immediately inform the
appropriate employee of any inconsistencies in the loading sequence of outgoing
pallets and correct the problem.
5.2.2.3
RFID Support in the Warehouse
Figure 5.14 shows an example of a warehouse process with RFID support. In this
case, the RFID technology is used on a carton and pallet basis, but not on an item
basis. The illustration shows which logistics objects are processed, how RFID
support is used, what activities are performed and the tag coding employed.
5.2.2.4
Auto-ID Infrastructure and Event Management
The SAP Auto-ID Infrastructure (AII) works closely with SAP Event Management.
The following task distribution takes place:
•
SAP Event Management is oriented toward the business process. It undertakes
the company-wide collection of visibility and tracking data, the monitoring of
264
5
Controlling and Reporting

complete and distributed processes, and process monitoring with exception
handling.
•
SAP Auto-ID Infrastructure is closely oriented toward individual actions with
physical objects. It undertakes the local data processing for identiﬁcation data
stemming from RFID readers and other sensors. It also supports data ﬁltering
and pre-consolidation, and can issue a direct message to operators if scans lead
to unexpected results.
5.2.2.5
Data Processing Using AII
The Auto-ID Infrastructure can be supplied by logistics systems with details on the
expected RFID data. The expected data then can be consulted for reference to
compare with the scanned data. This enables the determination of whether or not
there are deviations from the expected objects. If there are deviations, the system
can directly inform the user of the RFID reader.
Figure 5.15 shows a process in which a supplier submits notiﬁcation of an
incoming delivery of a pallet containing 16 cartons with a total of 256 serialized
items (1).
All units are equipped with RFID tags. The supplier electronically supplies
inbound delivery details with precise RFID tag information (SSCC number for
the pallet, SSCC numbers for the cartons, SGTIN for the items. An event handler is
created for the pallets via the inbound delivery generated in SAP ERP, and the
detailed, expected RFID tag information is transmitted to and saved in the Auto-ID
Infrastructure (2).
Once the initial scan of the pallet has been performed, the exact tag information
is sent by the reader to AII (3). Here, a comparison of the received information

with the previously saved, expected information can be performed (4). The Auto-
ID Infrastructure can inform warehouse workers immediately if the number of
scanned objects deviates from the expected amount (such as in a shortfall) or if
other items or serial numbers have been delivered than those indicated in the
notiﬁcation.
If the details of the initial scan are correct, the Auto-ID sends a message such
as “Pallet received, status OK” to Event Management (5). This establishes the
relationship between the 265 individual scans at the gate reader and the business
process. The event handler conﬁrms the correct arrival of the pallet (6) and can
initiate a goods receipt in ERP (7).

5.2.3.1
EPC Information System
Within the context of RFID and EPC technology, we have already demonstrated
that with the concept of the central EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information
System), a reduction in costs for the RFID tags can be achieved by storing context
and history data regarding the physical object on a central server and making it
available there.

EPCIS is thus a standard to electronically track identiﬁable objects along the
supply chain. The data regarding the what, when, where and why of an object at the
individual reading stations is collected centrally and can be queried and distributed
via standardized interfaces and services.
5.2.3.2
EPCIS Based on SAP Event Management
The functions and characteristics are a basic component of SAP Event Manage-
ment. As such, it seemed only logical to expand Event Management in the direction
of EPCIS. With its Object Event Repository (OER), SAP offers a solution certiﬁed
by EPCglobal and corresponding to EPCIS Version 1.0 for the implementation of
EPCIS based on SAP Event Management. This solution enables you to seamlessly
track hierarchically nested objects as well as to authenticate objects in critical
processes.
Proof of process for sales and distribution
One example of this is the seamless proof of process for drug production and
distribution, which has been or is slated to be implemented in several
countries and which, among other points, is designed to support the identiﬁ-
cation of counterfeit drugs (see Fig. 5.16). High-quality drugs are already
supplied with RFID tags on every package during production. This allows the
in-warehouse storage as well as transport to wholesale and retail facilities to
be tracked and documented. In practical terms, it would also be possible to
access the exact history of a medication purchased in a pharmacy and thus be
able to detect a counterfeit.

SAP Object Event Repository (OER) offers standard event, collection and query
interfaces in correlation with the EPCIS norm in order to collect information on
explicitly identiﬁed objects and exchange it with other involved partners. In this
process, the entire lifecycle of an object can be recorded. If objects are
hierarchically packaged, this information can be recorded in a hierarchical display
or relational context in OER. The following relationships are possible: simple EPC
numbers, tag identiﬁcation EPC numbers or a pallet-carton-item relationship.
5.3
Reporting and Determining Key Performance Indicators
Economic background of key performance indicators: The components of SAP
logistics solutions accumulate a large amount of various data in the business
processes in order to meet the demands of diverse parties including one’s own
company, business partners, freight carriers, ofﬁcial administrations and customs.
Much of the data is determined automatically or forwarded via electronic commu-
nication. The data volume that is generated in a logistics process can thus be very
high. It is not always easy for companies and individual end users to come to
conclusions based on the data with regard to the success or failure of a process
execution.
Competitive edge: Companies often have a decisive edge over their competitors
if they can structure their logistics activities proﬁtably and effectively on the basis
of detailed analyses. Data from the past can help you learn lessons for the future and
change business structures accordingly. Existing relationships and contracts with
customers and suppliers can be newly negotiated based on determined performance
and ﬁnancial data, or processes or business areas can be discontinued.
Reporting in logistics spans details from the structural data analysis in day-to-day
business to complex analyses of individual cost components to the determination of
key performance indicators (KPI), used for corporate management. Knowledge of
this data and access to the data of operative logistics, tracking, ﬁnancing and
purchasing systems are decisive factors for the generation of key indicators.
Data aggregation in SAP NetWeaver BW: In practice, complex system
environments can often be found. This means that corporate reporting must be
possible beyond system boundaries in order to achieve optimal results. Movement
data as well as master data are needed. Data integration and processing by
employees generating ﬂy Excel spreadsheets, which is still standard practice in
several ﬁrms, should soon be a thing of the past; this manual procedure is complex
and prone to error, and the task can be performed by the data warehouse system.
SAP logistics applications use two components to generate key performance
indicators beyond the processes:
•
SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW), with which you
can generate complex analyses and reports.
•
The Information System, which offers limited analyses directly in ERP.

Controlling and Reporting

In addition, SAP BusinessObjects products are a new component in the SAP
Portfolio that can present the data from a data warehouse and other data sources in
report or dashboard form.
5.3.1
SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse
Using SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse, data from SAP systems, non-SAP
systems and structured ﬁles (such as Excel spreadsheets) can be processed. Display
of the data is either done in a spreadsheet structure or as a conclusive dashboard
with signal lights, speedometer graphs or diagrams. For the spreadsheet depiction,
you can also select a Microsoft Excel display.
5.3.1.1
Current Data at the Push of a Button
Through SAP NetWeaver BW, the authorized personnel in a company have access
to current data at the push of a button to make decisions and control day-to-day
business accordingly.
5.3.1.2
New Possibilities
BW consists of the actual data storage with its administration tools for data
deﬁnition, updating, aggregation and queries as well as the BW content that deﬁnes
data storage and queries based on content. The BW content is application-depen-
dent and is generally provided as a release for speciﬁc application components. In
Fig. 5.17, you can see a view of a part of the InfoProvider supplied with SAP from
the logistics realm.
The latest technologies like SAP BusinessObjects tools or the SAP NetWeaver
Visual Composer use encapsulated Enterprise Services to extract data from various
systems and depict them in an easy-to-conﬁgure user interface. Reporting is thus no
longer programming work, but rather a business process that can be executed by
almost any employee.
5.3.2
The Information System in SAP ERP
The information system in SAP ERP can be considered a precursor to SAP
NetWeaver BW and serves the statistical processing of logistics data in a pure
ERP environment. Because the information system is relatively limited in function
and from an architectural perspective is no longer entirely current, we only mention
it here brieﬂy. For company-wide reporting, the trend is clearly toward BW/
Business Intelligence.
5.3
Reporting and Determining Key Performance Indicators

5.3.2.1
Different Characteristics
The information system consists of several individual applications in SAP ERP:
•
The Logistics Information System (LIS) generates statistical overviews for
warehouse, sales and distribution and transportation processes.
•
The Sales Information System (SD-IS) generates statistical overviews for sales.
•
The Purchasing Information System (PIS) generates statistical overviews related
to purchasing.
5.3.2.2
LIS Standard Analyses
Using LIS as an example, Figure 5.18 shows the basic logistics key ﬁgures and
overviews that provide the standard analyses.
5.3.2.3
Key Sales and Distribution Indicators
Figure 5.19 shows an example involving the order activities per sales ofﬁce with a
breakdown of weekly key ﬁgures for the Hamburg ofﬁce. In addition, it illustrates
the key weight and volume indicators for sales and distribution activities in the
shipping points.

The SCOR Data Model
The SCOR model (Supply Chain Operations Reference) deﬁned by the Supply
Chain Council (see http://www.supply-chain.org), contains a series of signiﬁcant

key ﬁgures that supply important data from the entire logistics chain. These key
performance indicators enable an assessment of logistics efﬁciency, from suppliers
to production to customers, in the following areas:
•
Logistics chain planning
•
Procurement processes
•
Manufacturing processes and stock management
•
Distribution processes
•
Return processes
5.3.3.1
Key SCOR Indicators in the BW Content
SAP comes installed with standard BW content for the SCOR model. In the areas
cited above, the following reports are available:
•
Procurement logistics
•
Supplier cycle time
•
Stock management
•
Stock obsolescence as a percentage of total stock
•
Range of coverage of stock in days
•
Raw material range of coverage for production
•
Manufacture
•
Capacity utilization
•
Production yield
•
Compliance with the production plan
•
Production cycle
•
Costs per unit
•
Overhead costs
•
Order fulﬁllment
– Supplier reliability regarding conﬁrmed delivery dates
– Supplier reliability regarding customer’s requested delivery date
– Percentage of orders delivered on the requested date
– Lead time for order fulﬁllment
The use of the key SCOR indicators enables reporting based on standardized and
thus comparable deﬁnitions that also have cross-company signiﬁcance.

Reports and Dashboards: Examples
5.3.4.1
Simple Interpretation of Complex Data
Reporting is a sweeping term, spanning all corporate divisions. In order to arrive
at a simple interpretation of frequently complex data, programs have begun using
272

dashboards, where “instruments” provide a visualization of the most important key
indicators. Parts of the following examples come directly from the Transportation
Management or Event Management system, and parts are based on data taken from
the BW realm.
5.3.4.2
Example 1: Driver Delays
The ﬁrst example (Fig. 5.20) shows a typical analysis from the freight forwarding
environment. It shows instances of delays per driver and truck so that delivery
precision can be monitored.
An analysis of this type requires the seamless tracking of departure and arrival
times, which can be achieved with the aid of SAP Event Management and the
respective on-board computer and integration of the vehicle’s geographic
coordinates (geofencing). This data can be provided to a data warehouse and
combined with operative data from Transportation Management. A detailed view,
as shown in the lower right of the illustration, is a possible result.
5.3.4.3
Example 2: Fuel Consumption
The second example (Fig. 5.21) show similar data with reference to the fuel
consumption of a vehicle ﬂeet. In this example, too, not all data comes from a
Fig. 5.20 Dashboard for the tardiness of truck drivers

TM system, but also from other systems such as a fuel management system or on-
board diagnostic application that sends data from the vehicle to a central server,
where it is extracted and forwarded to BW.

Example 3: Warehouse Management
The third example shows a dashboard created with SAP BusinessObjects Xcelsius,
which offers a manager view of the most important warehouse management data of
a contract logistics service provider. The Xcelsius application shown in Fig. 5.22
can be easily integrated in Web applications and sent as a PDF without losing
dynamic operability.
5.3.5
Data Extraction from SAP Logistics Applications
5.3.5.1
BW Communication Process
After examining the application examples and economic background of key perfor-
mance indicators and reporting, we will now conclude with a look at the integration
of logistics applications with SAP NetWeaver BW.
Figure 5.23 shows the principle process. When SAP logistics applications run
either via the user interface or through planning or batch reports, a data backup
generally takes place before the end of the transaction. Once the backup is
completed, that is, when the transaction is obviously ﬁnished and new data has
been updated, an extraction of data relevant to characteristic and key ﬁgure
determination is performed.

For this, depending on the system components, various technical procedures are
used (determined by the individual programs). Data extraction and thus updating of
the BW, however, can be switched off for each application in SAP Customizing.
The data extraction method is tailored to the application object. The extraction
method then puts the data in a DataSource for transfer to BW.
In the Business Warehouse, DataSource information is stored in DataStore
objects. From these DataStore objects, the InfoProviders (formerly known as
InfoCubes) are provided with information. The InfoProviders save the actual
characteristics and key ﬁgures. They, in turn, are used by Multi Providers as a
data source.
5.3.5.2
Queries
After placement of data in a MultiProvider, you can access information in the
Business Warehouse with various queries and combine this information with other
available data to perform targeted analyses. These analyses can be displayed in
spreadsheets, reports or dashboards.
5.4
Summary
In the SAP world, you can achieve efﬁcient and automated control of logistics
processes by utilizing the components Event Management, Auto-ID Infrastructure
and Object Event Repository in a form tailored to your processes.
Event Management enables you to perform detailed tracking of status and
logistics processes. The Auto-ID Infrastructure serves as the interface of logistics
applications and Event Management with the use of RFID technology as a data and
event source. Finally, the Object Event Repository enables efﬁcient collection,
storage, management and distribution of lifecycle data of individual RFID-enabled
physical objects in a logistics chain.
With the aid of the SAP logistics applications and the process control
components described above, you can extract a variety of characteristics and key
ﬁgures that are updated in the BW or information system and made available for
queries. A number of visualization methods (from Excel to BW reports, to Visual
Composer dashboards to the ﬂexible SAP BusinessObjects tools) facilitate a depic-
tion and data assessment to ﬁt any target group.
We have now reached the end of this book. We hope we were able to demonstrate
that you can use the components of SAP Business Suite from areas such as procure-
ment, production, sales and distribution (examined in detail in Volume 1, “Logistic
Core Operations with SAP: Procurement, Production and Distribution Logistics”), as
well as transportation and warehouse management – the focus of this volume – to
seamlessly map a diversity of logistics processes in information systems. SAP
Business Suite is thus an ideal basis for system-supported logistics execution.
