What do Real E commerce Website Owners think
of E commerce: Get It Right?
Id lost hope and was ready to quit with debts up to my eyeballs! Luckily a good friend recommended the E
commerce: Get It Right! Guide. Within 2 months of opening this e commerce bible, I learned how to multiply
my web traffic by 3, I increased my conversions by 20% and started to contact my customer database of
20,000 people on a weekly basis, from which I sold them multiple products that I never imagined they would
want. Back end marketing alone has added at least $2k a month to my bottom line. Dan, TG Store
What else can I say about Ecommerce: Get It Right! but THANK YOU! I had used 5 designers and had 5
failures and was tearing my hair out. E commerce: Get It Right was the missing piece of the puzzle. I bought a
copy for my web team and got them to read every bit of it from cover to cover. The result is an e commerce
website that actually makes money and has top search rankings in Google, and I have another 2 e commerce
sites in development to attack my market! Steffan, Sol Ace Technologies
Working with Ian has enabled me to add e commerce to my CV. His insights, skills and tell it like is style got
me from e commerce zero to e commerce hero in less than 6 months. I not only sell online myself now in
multiple and varied markets, but my team builds e commerce websites and offers private e commerce
consulting for an elite clientele charging from $5 to $25K regularly. Mike, Synergy Web Media
The E commerce: Get It Right! book woke me up to the potential of e commerce and how successful
businesses operate and make big profits. It also quickly taught me to ditch everything I thought I knew about
e commerce! My sales went from 1 a day to 5 a day within 30 days. Paul, Car Digital Developments
After only one day of e commerce training with Ian I was able to approach my e commerce website with a
new strategy, increasing sales from 1 in 300 visitors to buyers to 1 in 75. Using my complimentary copy of the
Ecommerce: Get It Right! Guide gives me options and on every page I find gems that I can immediately action
on the live website. My advice, read it now. Steve, Hancocks Jewellers
I've been selling online since 2003 on and off of eBay, and I thought I had mastery. Using the E commerce:
Get It Right! Guide techniques, the no nonsense approach and the practical tips inside opened up a whole
new realm of e commerce profits for my e commerce websites. Dean, Funky Footwear
As a web designer with a graphic designer background I thought I was building stunning websites! I was, and
that was the problem: my customers would have a site that was visually stunning, but unfortunately made no
sales. Working with Ian over a 3 year period taught me how to sell online, but also enabled me to build e
commerce sites that rank top 10 in Google and sell products in larger quantities. Derek, Richer Designs

About This Book
The first in a series of books Direct & Simplified on the subjects of E commerce, Web Business, Web
Marketing, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Buying and Selling Websites. They are all taken
from over 10 years in the trenches, and real life experience working in these fields with my own e
commerce and website businesses.
The E commerce: Get It Right! guide is designed for you to easily and effortlessly assimilate this
knowledge. Youll be able to implement the practical tips immediately on your website to maximize
sales and profits in the fastest possible time.
The information is presented in a simple to use, quick fire style, with magic bullets one after the
other.
Everything is covered: from planning an e commerce website and business, to refining and
marketing your website to triple or even quadruple sales.
Buying and Selling online is what I do 365 days a year, be it physical products, information products
or websites. Most e commerce sites unfortunately do not survive their first 3 years online so this
information is essential for your immediate profitability and long term e commerce success.

It doesnt matter what product you sell, what country you are based in, or whether you wish to

How to Use This Book
Choose from 3 Simple Ideas to Help Implement, Maximize and Retain the
Information Within:
1) Print off and use a highlighter pen to mark areas of the book you wish to reference. You
could even print each of the 4 Main Steps separately. Alternatively, simply take notes of
important pages pertinent to your website in a word processor such as Microsoft Word.
2) On a plain piece of paper, draw a line down the middle to make two columns. Top left, write
Action Items and top right write Takeaways.
Action Items: are what you want to implement right now on your website.
Takeaways: are for your future use and as references.
3) Use mind mapping software such as MindManager.
The software lets you create a map with a center, and branches leading out from the center.
In the center of the map, write this book & the authors name (thats me!). On each branch
you create, write the book chapter and keywords you are focusing on. An example here
might be Design Elements. Then on each of these branches write the points and references
you wish to use and apply now or use later.
Searching the PDF book:
Click the page numbers that you can see in the two Contents Pages to jump to your desired page.
To quickly search for a keyword in the book, type: Ctrl F (hold down the ctrl key and press F) and
enter the word in the search box. Alternatively enter term in search box and hit enter.
Wording Notes:
Throughout the book, I also refer to Electronic Commerce as E commerce.
I use site and website to mean the same thing.
Web Designer covers Web Developer, Web Agency, and Graphic Designer.
Prospects are Potential Customers before they buy from you.
Stock covers Inventory too.
Shipping is Delivery.
Courier is a Shipping or Logistics Company.
Shopping Cart also means Shopping Basket.

About Ian Daniel
Thanks for investing in the book! This is not another inferior made in the Far East eBook rebranded
for quick sales. The contents, insights and practical tips inside come from over 10 years online e
commerce experience. Ive built up, done business in and subsequently sold 3 e commerce and
information site business networks (total 25 plus sites) all trading profitably. In addition Ive built,
managed, consulted on and SEO engineered as many websites for happy clients. This is my
guarantee to you that you are in good hands.
Who can best guide you and provide the most effective real life and cutting edge information for
your e commerce business success?
1) A web agency who builds websites but has never sold a product from an e commerce
website to date?
2) A writer or blogger who writes for a living?
3) Or someone who has built e commerce websites from the ground up, search engine
optimized them to reach top spots in Google, refined them to convert 1 in 33 visitors to a
sale (the average is only 0.7 in every 100), sold e commerce websites for big profit and
ultimately lived the e commerce lifestyle 7 days a week for 10 years?
This book simplifies and demystifies my best ideas, insights and strategies. It also details the
mistakes I made so that you can avoid them and get it right from the start. I'm not a professional
writer. I've written the book from cover to cover myself. Refusing to use a fancy pants writer meant
that the book has kept its raw edge its important that you feel my enthusiasm. The language may
not be the prettiest, but the content is GOLD!

Introduction to E commerce Business
What Is E commerce?
The Dictionary says: e commerce: Commerce transacted electronically, as over the Internet.
Synonyms include: e commerce, electronic Commerce, E commerce, online retail, online trading,
and selling online.
Selling and transacting like this can be done thanks to the World Wide Web, which is the global
combination of links, information, web pages and e commerce websites. All of this is delivered to us
via the Internet, an infrastructure of computers all linked together.
E commerce embodies anything from selling a domain name to selling music downloads, or from
information products like this eBook to physical products such as a DVD or clothing. Once ordered
these products are shipped direct to your customers door. The term e commerce is also commonly
used for selling physical products to retail customers (Business to Consumer, B2C) and business
customers (Business to Business, B2B). Therefore, we will focus on these in this book.
Online E commerce Business vs. Offline Business.
The advantage of an online business is that you can sell a complete selection of products, with no
limits on space. A bookstore can only hold so many books, but online you can display and sell the
entire range of book titles the world over, should you wish.
An online business typically has highly automated and more efficient software and systems. Online
marketing is highly targeted and ultimately e commerce overhead costs are lower. On the flip side, if
not managed well e commerce costs can skyrocket and sink your business.
E commerce businesses do not have a typical storefront with passing trade (footfall), so you cannot
be passive and wait for customers to come to you, as many offline retailers do.
However, just like an offline business, a website needs traffic (customers), conversions (sales) and
its essential you build a relationship by communicating with your customers to offer them valuable
information and products on the back end (after the sale is made).
Just like any business, if you do not plan, forecast, budget and do not invest appropriately from the
start, you will struggle to make profits and ultimately fail. Be prepared to allocate and invest
accordingly into your e commerce business, website and marketing from the day you startthis
means start assertively, not passively!
If you already have an offline business, bolting on an e commerce business could be the way to
double or even triple your profits and reach customers in parts of the world you never knew existed.
However, an analysis of the pros and cons must be completed. If approached without planning or
checking the numbers it may just add unnecessary costs, which reduce your profits.
11

www.ecommercegetitright.com
A Sad Statistic.
Sad but true! 97% of e commerce websites make $0 profits in their first 3 years online. Such is the
steep learning curve and skill set required to build an e commerce website in order to ultimately
dominate your product category, market or niche.
Have you heard the phrase work on your business and not in your business? Well, the 97% referred
to above are doing the latter.
Spend 20% of your time on Operations and 80% on Marketing
Once trapped running your e commerce website, its damned hard to escape and spend time where
you should be, marketing your business to greater profits. Aim to be part of the profitable 3% as
quickly as possible, and your e commerce sales and profits will skyrocket...
Having been part of the 97% from 200003 and subsequently part of the elite 3% from 2004 on
doing sales in the multi millions and growingin very competitive marketsI can give you the
benefit of impartial views and experiences, and I have the e commerce stripes to help you.
So its not all doom and gloom. E commerce can be exciting, fulfilling and very profitable if you plan
from the ground up, grow consistently and get it right from day one. Ill show you how in this book.
E commerce Success Story.
Amazon.com is the most successful e commerce website online. Its also my all time favorite e
commerce website! In 1996 Amazon exploded onto the e commerce scene pioneering the way in
online retailing to date. By February 2010 it had 124 million customers worldwide.
Many companies have tried to imitate but very few can replicate such massive success. Amazons
web team fully understands its web customers, and why they buy from its website.
Personalization.
Amazon takes marketing to the next level where most websites simply do not. The people at
Amazon analyze user data and utilize this to build, design, personalize and structure their website
accordingly, to answer their customers questions, fears and frustrations and match the wants and
desires of their customers exactly. They introduced and pioneered product Recommendation
Engines and Systems.
This essentially means once you have user data you can target and match your products to your
customers buying interests and behaviors. This then means they SPEND like crazy with you. More on
this strategy in Step 2 & Step 4.

Thirteen Common E commerce Mistakes
Lets start by looking at the most common mistakes made by e commerce websites and e commerce
businesses and why they fail. Read the quick guide below as your first step to avoid falling into the
same traps. Well delve deeper into each point in subsequent areas of the book...
1) You Dont Have to Get it Right, You Just Have to Get it Going.
This is critical for an online activity as the internet and technology changes so fast. Too many
businesses waste time analyzing, planning and thinking without taking action. These three areas are
obviously important, however as soon as the Research, Numbers and Exit Strategy (or goal) is
established and make financial sense, then get started. The perfect time will never come, so take
action now.
When building a new website, I always push to get it live within 7 days from the date the
development starts. This enables me to test the website in a live working environment. Googles
spiders can start to index my site immediately, setting me up with an assertive approach and on the
front foot. Because customers wont be on the website yet, it doesnt matter if it is not complete.
2) Poor Planning, Forecasting & Accounts.
Planning is essential to establish that your new e commerce website can and will make money. You
need to find out:
If there is a demand for your product online?
Are the products you intend to sell actually selling online and in what numbers?
What are your competitors prices like? Are they charging less than you can buy the product
for at trade price? This can happen online.
Will your e commerce website be profitable?
When your site is trading you must monitor key accounting areas at least weekly especially your
sales and costs, and the resulting net profit (bottom line).
3) Trying to be all Things to all People.
Once you have completed your research, decide on the number of products you will sell a few
products, a hundred products or thousands of products? Its your decision, but weigh up the time
to order products, add the products to the site, process orders, stock, ship, provide support, etc.
The more pages on a website, the better for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) reasons. However,
many product pages will mean you need to do lots of product management. So be honest with
yourself before you begin this project and determine if you can actually afford the time spent on
the above processes.
You could even split your products into separate websites for each niche or main product category.
This would focus your positioning and optimization for each specific product range. Customers will
consider you an expert if they see you specializing in one product range. More on this in Step 1.
13

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Customer sales usually also means customer support. Over time, you will find and set your own
boundaries and limits concerning customer demands and requests. Stick to your principles and
run a tight ship. Offer value for money in your business transactions, but do not become a slave to
your customers or suppliers. You are in business to make money, not to make friends with
everyone, and to provide exceptional value for money.
4) Poor Quality E commerce Software.
Using poor quality e commerce software will affect usability for you and for your customer.
Problems include; a slow load time in your users browser, poorly laid out products, inferior
search engine optimization features, all leading ultimately to an arduous e commerce
experience.
Good e commerce software loads fast, has a great structure for the user so they can find
products easily, and is built so Google can find and index your products with ease.
Flexible e commerce software that can grow and adapt with your business is essential to
automate laborious processes. This will free you up to work on your business and avoid
working in it as previously mentioned.
5) Poor Design.
Design is the first visual element that new and existing customers notice on your website when
they enter your site. As these processes are subconsciousand adding to the challenge, you
only have approx 57 seconds to capture your visitors attentionyour design has to be right or
your visitor will leave, also known as bounce. Bounce Rate is an online measurement that
expresses the percentage of visitors who only see a single page on your website before leaving.
This all starts with hiring the right web designer for your project needs. Most designers simply
do not have the innate ability to design good websites, which is why so many websites die a
slow death in cyberspace. You will learn how to hire a great designer in Step 3.
Avoid using Flash (a tool for presenting images and text in a graphical format) if it is not
required. Flash has no place on an e commerce website as its big, clumsy, loads slowly and cant
be indexed by Google. This in turn means it is bad for SEO. Flash shows off the design skills of
the Flash designer but is next to useless when designing a site for profits. There is one exception
to this comment: product demo videos produced in Flash can be very useful, but ensure they
are compressed using FLV format, so they are quick to load.
Ultimately, your website has to load Fast, be Functional and be Familiar; this is the 3 F Strategy.
Keep the colors clean and pertinent to your positioning and product ranges, and use clean
uncluttered text and font styles. Make it easy to read by using lots of background white space,
with text headers and items grouped in small boxes or small sizes for quick page scanning.
6) Poor Usability & Conversion.
Less than one person in every 100 visitors to the average e commerce website will buy!
Increasing this visitor to sale conversion rate is all about usability and a simple conversion path.
This includes everything from the way the graphics, images, text, navigation menus are used on
the website. Prospects (potential customers) need a simple, clean path from entry (entering
14

www.ecommercegetitright.com
your website) to exit (having bought your product) without resistance or site elements that
make them have to think or work out what to do.
7) Too Busy & Cluttered.
How many websites have you visited where they hit you with too much content too soon,
whether its graphics, images and options, and where you have no idea where to start? There is
no clear entry to the products, no sales funnel, and no clear path through to the checkout. This
equals failure!
So keep your design clean and clear, keep it simple, keep it direct and to the point, and give
your site visitors what they want in an organized layout from the second they enter to the
second they leave. This is about guiding them through your sales funnel.
8) Poor Keyword/Key Phrase Selection.
Many websites fail to match their site content with the search terms that their prospects search
for in Google. This critical component to driving lots of free organicalso known as natural
search engine traffic to your website starts with detailed Keyword research.
When writing content for your website, especially on your home page, category and product
pages, you need to target these specific keywords and key phraseswhich your prospect will
type in the Google search boxin order to get this traffic on to your website.
9) Poor Content.
The use of poor content including headlines, product descriptions, font styles, colors, etc on a
website can massively reduce sales. Incorrect spelling (typos), poor grammar, uninspired and
feature focused product descriptions all written in a boring style determine whether a
customer stays (sticks) or leaves your website. You have approximately 57 seconds
(maximum) to capture your prospects attention, when they enter any page of your website. So
make your web pages sticky.
Your content needs to captivate, educate and inspire your prospects to want to take action and
buy your products, read your blog or sign up to your email newsletter. Use emotional triggers
by focusing on benefits, experiences and results that your products will give your prospects
and future customers.
10) Zero or Poor Quality Traffic.
Traffic simply means visitors to your website. Low traffic or traffic that is not targeted to your
products, will result in zero or poor sales. This is one of the main reasons that so many websites
fail. Starting with the right e commerce software, good design, a strong on site and off site SEO
strategy will give you a solid foundation for e commerce success. Add the back end customer
communication strategy for your site, and your success is guaranteed.
11) Not Analyzing User Data & Testing.
The internet, user behavior and buying habits are in constant change. Most websites owners do
not use the freeand very detailedstatistics available to analyze their customer behavior,
preferences and the products they buy. Using this free data such as your e commerce admin
15

www.ecommercegetitright.com
statistics, your server logs (hosting account stats) and Google Analytics will present you with key
information enabling you to refine your website, resulting in a big increase in sales and profits.
Successful websites including Amazon.com often run multiple tests on their website daily to
gather data and respond to the results. They test everything from a simple image placement on
their homepage, product layout, add to cart buttons, to the messages and products you see
when you have placed an orderthe order confirmation page.
Further to this, testing allows you to see which areas of your website are performing or where
the leaks are that need repairing. When you make changes, ask your family, friends or
colleagues to see if your site and its functions are seamless and easy to order. The less
experienced the tester, the better, as you will get a realistic view from their responses.
12) Unaware of the 80/20 Rule (Paretos Principle).
Give or take, most web actions and results work out at 80/20 and this simply means 80% of your
results (effects) will come from 20% of your actions, products or processes (causes).
As an example, you will find approximately 80% of your sales come from 20% of your product
range and 80% of customer service issues will come from 20% of your products, etc.
Once you have data to work with you can start a Best Sellers page and promote your top
sellers. You can automate and extract your top selling products and display these on the live site.
Apply this where you can throughout your e commerce business and it will help efficiency,
productivity, sales and profits.
13) No Back End Marketing.
The majority of website ownersincluding most e commerce websitesdo not know how, or
just cannot be bothered to contact their prospects, once they are sold a product and become
customers. Big Mistake! Once you have customers, its essential to communicate with them
regularly via email newsletters, RSS, social and video sites or by traditional mail and offer them
more products. Because you have now built a relationship with themand they have your trust
and experience they are more likely to buy from you, again and again.
We have now touched on the Negatives & Positives of E commerce. Your choice is:
be part of the average, unprofitable 97%; or be in the elite 3% and be profitable. So,
that said, lets jump right in with 4 Key E commerce Foundational Principles...

E commerce success comes down to a basic philosophy, can do attitude and a formula that when
planned and executed equals sales, profit and wealth for you and your business. The formula
detailed in this book is split into 4 main parts; its essentially a 4 step Formula with key
components described in each of the 4 steps.
E commerce Foundation Principles
Before we get into the four main steps of the book, I just want to touch on the following four simple,
yet explosively powerful and essential foundational strategies for any e commerce websiteI call
these the Foundational 4.
These are the basic principles that you need to apply, even before we get to the detail in the other
Four Main Steps that come afterwards in this book.
Principle #1) Traffic > Conversion > Relationships.
Traffic.
Your website needs traffic. Without targeted traffic your site will get lost in cyberspace gathering
virtual cobwebs! Sure, over time, someone will stumble on your website. Some visitors may even
buy your product or service, or subscribe to your email newsletter list or blog; however, the
numbers will be pitiful.
How do We Get Traffic and Thousands of Visitors per Month?
Strategy.
Because the majority of web searchers use the Google search engine (approx 80%), it has the
market share majority with regards to web traffic. The sole purpose of the Google search engine is
to send these web users to appropriate and matching sites. This is where your site needs to be.
Being in the top 10 is vital
anything under this and your traffic potential plummets. So build your
website so that its Google Friendly!
There are many other different ways to get hordes of ready to buy traffic to your new site such as
Pay Per Click advertising or social media marketing. However, it makes sense to start with strong
foundations and a long term free/organic search engine traffic strategy in mind.
Conversion.
Once you get traffic (visitors) to your website, you have to do something with them. Are they taking
action? Are you converting them, monetizing them, getting them to subscribe to your email list or
selling them your products?
18

www.ecommercegetitright.com
What is your Call to Action or Most Wanted Response? Lets be clear
with an e commerce
website, you want the sale! As a minimum, you need to capture their email address or get them to
click your Adsense advert (publicity that you can put on your site to make you money) when they
leave your sitethis is a monetized exit click.
Average conversion rates in e commerce suck. Approximately 0.7 out of every 100 visitors will buy
your product. Your website must have clear text, images, navigation, a clean design and a simple call
to action (add to cart/shopping basket). Visitors must easily understand what you want them to
do. If not, forget it  just one CLICK and they are gone to your competitors!
Strategy.
A clean, simple yet professional site design, based on a fast, functional and familiar layout.
Navigation and structure with clear instructions and content. These are the things to help you to
increase your desired conversion rate
anywhere from 1% to 4% overnight. Do the math
if youve
been selling one product per day at $100, then overnight after making some subtle design,
navigational and conversion changes you could increase this to $400, without spending a cent more
on marketing.
With your conversion strategy, you need to take your site visitors by the hand from site entry to exit
(with a sale) in as few steps as possible and as fast as possible, with as little resistance as possible.
Resistance can come from many areas such as poor design, poor content and poor navigation, in
addition to poor product descriptions and common issues of poor trust and negative security. There
are many other areas of resistance that can also hurt success, such as your checkout process, which
we will look at later in Step 2.
Relationships.
This is not an essential component to making a sale (on the front end) or making an e commerce
site work in the short term. However, Statistics suggest up to 35% of customers will buy from you
again if you offer them a further productonce they have already ordered from you. It is obvious
that this simple strategy alone could supercharge your profits. This is back end marketing.
Building relationships or communicating is all about providing your visitors with good, useful,
reliable content, advice, information and tips and tricks, and of course, product offers mixed in. You
can even personalize your emails to match your customers buying habits by adding their name into
the email and promoting products based on their buying history. This is personalization.
Strategy.
After a sale or after subscription to your opt in email newsletter list or RSS feed, it is imperative to
communicate with your customers and communicate often. However, if you only provide low quality
regurgitated content or attempts to sell your product or service too hard, one simple click of the
'unsubscribe' link in your email, and your customers could be gone forever.
So, talk to your customers. Offer a newsletter, an RSS news feed, ask them questions via surveys.
Run competitions, get them to follow you on Facebook and Twitter and give away freebies. Your
19

www.ecommercegetitright.com
customers will see you as an expert in your product category, market or niche and will hang on every
word you say, resulting in more sales!
Principle #2) 3 F Strategy.
The days of having a simple 5 page brochure website with your company details and a few
pictures are long gone. E commerce websites now generally have at least thirty pages plus, many
over a thousand pages. These are big websites with lots of content and multiple images per page.
Yet, a surprisingly large number of businesses both large and small simply do not understand e
commerce. They launch websites that actually drive customers away because they are slow,
cluttered and use complex navigational menus that you would need a college degree to understand.
However, you can easily make your e commerce website work exceptionally well. In fact, the most
simple, basic strategies are often the most effective, but the most overlooked. Many of the latest
software, web tools and e commerce modules available offer make it easy for your site to be
dynamic and interactive. They allow you to add more content, more easily, without having to call
your web developer every time you need to make a simple tweak to the information on your site.
At a fundamental level you need to implement a 3 F Strategy: Your
e commerce website must be Fast, Functional and Familiar!
Most people go onto an e commerce site with a specific goal in mind
for example to buy an MP3
player, DVD or item of clothing. You have to help them accomplish that goal, and fast. People do not
want to wait forever to negotiate their way through arty graphics or unfamiliar navigational menus
or even worse, wait for Flash to load.
Many sites still have not taken this lesson on board; even a decade after some big name online
retailers went belly up. Pretty but ineffective websites with unnecessary Flash interfaces and
areas that users never venture into are very common. In addition, even with broadband internet in
millions of homes around the globe, many websites still take forever to download. Lets say it again
you only have approximately 57 seconds to make them stick, or your prospects are gone!
User experience and interactivity is critical for your success on the web,
as thats all there is! This is the conversion process personified!
Your site should also function like other successful sites. Therefore, if you design a new menu
interface with buttons in unfamiliar places, your users may not know how, or simply not bother to
learn how to use it and then leave your site. A user may admire a pretty site once, but they will not
20

www.ecommercegetitright.com
return nor make a purchase. In contrast, people will return to a 3 F site (Fast, Functional and
Familiar) repeatedly. Your 3 F site will generate sales, repeat traffic and increasing profits.
Word of Warning: The danger of the readily available and open source website features and
modules is that they have in some instances brought needless complexity within the reach of
anyone. This can result in the temptation to spend a lot of time adding them to your site, leading to
a huge waste of time, energy and money.
As the Saying Goes: KISS = Keep it Simple St*pid!
Lets Look Closer at the 3 F Strategy:
Fast.
This aspect is so important because you need speed in all areas of your business, not just your site in
order to succeed. Customers have so many different options online, so why would they wait on you?
This encompasses your hosting, site load speed, email responses and your website ordering and
checkout process. Just as an example, if your site is slow to load, a customer will more often than
not leave right away.
Use These Site Components:
Fast & Reliable Hosting
Fast Site Load Speed (Maximum 5 seconds per page)
Compressed & Fast Images
Fast and Efficient Ordering
Fast Checkout with as Few Steps as Possible
Fast Security (SSL Certificate)
Functional.
Decide from day one, what the goal and desired outcome of your website is. When your potential
customers visit your site, can they find a product that they were looking for right away with as little
hassle and clicks as possible? Customers are simply going to look elsewhere if it is difficult to
purchase products from you! Take the time to think like your customer and complete all of the steps
in finding a product on your site and placing an order. Was it easy, does it make sense and would you
want to do it again?
21

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Load Your website with Useful Functional Features:
Use clean, easy to read text, graphics, and navigational buttons
Make it easy to use and navigate
Use common features making your visitors experience helpful
Give customers what they want in as few clicks as possible
Familiar.
It is important for customers to feel comfortable on your website, which has everything to do with
your chosen layout, structure and usability. For instance if you use strange navigational methods, if it
is incredibly difficult for a customer to search for products, find products and buy products, then
they will leave your site as quickly as they can click the back button in their browser.
You Need to Have Clear and User Friendly Site Elements:
Clear Layout & Structure
Common Navigation Bar & Obvious Buttons
Left Menu
Header & Footer
Clear Text with Headlines & Sub Headlines for Easy Scanning
Display Trusted Brands & Logos
Display Accreditations, Card & Security Logos to Establish Trust
Flexibility & Growth.
Ultimately, you need to decide what your objectives are. Be flexible and don't get too carried away
with web specific ambitions. You do not have to use software that is very expensive and complex;
use things that mesh closely with your business's objectives instead. Then get an e commerce
website out there and add functionality, as users demand it. You will never get your site perfect from
day one, so test and modify as you grow.
Hot Tip: All things being equal on a website, Google favors and ranks the more
mature site in the highest position, so time is of the essence: the time to launch your
e commerce site is now!
22

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Principle #3) Positioning.
Positioning is about perception and how you want your e commerce site and business as a whole to
be perceived by your prospects and customers. Remember, prospects are potential customers. So
ask yourself, do your target customers feel that this is the website they would like to buy from?
Position your e commerce website to match your prospects ideals.
Become Your Customer.
Get inside your customers minds and be them. See, think and feel what they do when buying your
product. It is about how your website should look based on its theme, colors, design, layout, etc, to
make your buyers want to spend time and money there. Essentially, you want something that is
contemporary, clean, and inviting to your potential and target customers; often neutral is best with
lots of background white space, a clean color, like a light gray and 1 or 2 accent colors to give
identity.
As an example, a website aimed at new mothers could use light blues, pinks and images of attractive
babies. A website aimed at selling high end, exclusive furniture might well use blacks, grays and
white to demonstrate class, with guarantees and security logos to build trust and show that the
website offers customers military strength security and that they are safe to spend here. In either
case, use words and language that your target customer understands and uses.
Taking the time to fully understand your target customer will consequently dictate the look and feel
of your site, especially relating to the features, layout, design, logo, colors and language used.
Create & Dominate Your Category.
To become a leading e commerce retailer in your chosen product area, it is critical you are seen as a
leader, a voice that people recognize and trust, and are happy to buy from. This links in with
branding, but takes it to a higher level in a number of ways. Youll see this with the big elite
companies such as Amazon, Apple, eBay, etc.
So Decide Now if You Are
1) Entering a small, restricted niche market and selling for example, one trendy
brand of womens T shirts?
2) Alternatively, are you entering a larger niche and selling many brands of T shirts
within the bigger category of clothing?
3) Alternatively, are you entering the top category and selling a large range of
clothing and many brands?
This is just a very simple example to detail the different levels. Option 2 above seems to be the more
profitable route for small to medium sized businesses to dominate that space. If you go too niche
as in option 1) you can restrict your sales potential, as the market may be very small.
To take this one step further, can you create your own category or niche? Let us say you started
manufacturing and supplying your own T shirts made from a new Eco Friendly material and you
23

www.ecommercegetitright.com
called these Eco Tee or whatever. This is now a new categoryEco Friendly T shirtsand you have
now just become the expert in this new category.
Control.
As a website owner you will publish lots of information including product descriptions, how to
guides, blogs, videos, newsletters and RSS. Therefore, through your content make it your objective
to control your prospects and customers, and only give them access to the information you feel is
right for them, in order to get them to buy your products. This is not about crossing ethical and
moral boundaries but essentially leading and directing your product category, market or niche.
This control allows you to captivate, educate, inspire and prime your audience, persuading them
that you have a product that fits their needs and wants. This is all about positioning and using
psychology or mind control marketing as Mark Joyner calls ithere is why this is important
Your customers want what you are offering, so do everything you can to
give it to them Before your competitors do!
Elites & Hierarchies.
When Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web, his idea was to create a space without rules
and regulations that would be equal for everyone including e commerce entrepreneurs. However,
the opposite is happening and those with the biggest resources or category dominance are shouting
the loudest and consequently making the most money.
Let Me Ask You Three Simple Questions
1) When you think of a Search Engine, who do you think of? Google!
2) When you think of buying online? Its Amazon and eBay!
3) When you think of a social media sites? Facebook & Twitter!
However if I ask you about Mens Dating, who do you think of? How about Anxiety Cure? In addition
to the big boys like Amazon and eBay, the internet medium has allowed Double Your Dating and The
Linden Method respectively to create and dominate these new information and e commerce
categories. These are just two multi million dollar and very successful companies from the
thousands of new categories being created online. Whether you sell physical products, information
products or both, e commerce is the transaction model used.
So how can you become number one in your category or niche and what will set you apart with your
positioning?
24

Principle #4) Problem Solution Model.
Think of the main objective of your website. This is where you get specific and focus on the products
and/or services you are selling to the customer. This is about your web design, text and product
descriptions. How they answer a question, a fear or a frustration, and offer a solution to a problem
your prospect has. This isnt just about marketing using scarcity as an emotional trigger. Its about
taking it to a deeper level mentally, emotionally and spiritually using emotional drivers in your
words, images, marketing and website positioning.
It is essential to decide what role your customers positive and negative emotions will play when
they visit your website and want to buy. You absolutely want to evoke strong positive (theyll feel
good if they buy) and negative (theyll feel bad if they dont) emotions by detailing experiences and
results to generate an immediate buying response.
When your potential customer visits your site, they need to find something they can identify with
and that will benefit them, remove a problem and offer a solution. You have doubtless heard the
saying Whats in it for me. Its very simple
that is all your customer cares about. What will the
product they are buying give them and get them?
If you are promoting a health or weight loss product as an e commerce store owner, you need to
hammer home the negatives (problem) and then offer benefits (solution) your product will give
them. It is a great strategy to base the benefits of your product around the current negative
situation (problem) your potential customer can identify with, and make the results easy to attain.

You need to position and present your website in a way that your potential customers see an
immediate benefit for them, so they will be eager to buy and experience the positive result and
emotions you are promising. What is your product going to give to them? What will they get from
using and owning your product? These are critically important things to think about because that is
what your customer will be thinking, feeling and asking...

Ten E commerce Project Preparation Essentials
Now that weve looked at the formula fundamentals for creating your new site strategy with a birds
eye view, its time to look in detail at the essential and specific components in preparation for a
successful e commerce website.
1) Plan for Profit.
This is critical for a successful e commerce business. The numbers or financials are your compass
and give you the true picture of where you are before you start and as you progress. They detail
your growth or your decline and failings. Numbers do not lie, period!
Analysis.
This is a time to be realistic and look at your business idea with honesty. Many small business
owners try to do everything themselves and 12 months down the line, they realize they are running
out of steamand cash. So ask yourself:
Will your idea work and can it work based on the following points?
Do you have the resources and money to make it work?
In addition, do you have the work force to make it happen and will it be profitable?
Plan.
Your plan will include a small written document covering key areas of your website and business and
will keep you focused and on track. You have heard the old adage If you Fail to Plan, you Plan to
Fail. How true
unless you hit the lottery and by pure chance you get it right first time without
planning. There is a better way. Stephen Pierce says to be successful you need to be:
FOCUSED. CONSISTENT. PATIENT
Planning Software.
You can plan on paper, in Microsoft Word or Visio, or using Mind Mapping software such as
MindManager. Your plan does not have to be 100 pages long. Remember KISS? So Keep it Simple.
Just cover the main areas and use bullets in your Word document or branches in your Mind
Mapping software. The most important software for your plan is a spreadsheet, using Microsoft
Excel, Google Docs or OpenOffice to handle the numbers and financial forecasting.

Google Docs: docs.google.com

Example of a Basic MindMap
Flexibility.
You and your plan have to be flexiblefrom the day your website launchesas it is work in progress
that acts as a template changing over time. You will not get everything right the first time you
implement it and your template will develop as you grow. Decide on a few contingencies for each
option and be flexible not rigid, so if you have to move the goal posts you can.
Time vs. Money.
When you start an e commerce website and business, there are two possible investment paths or
essentially two strategic options to choose from:
Option 1
Time: Will you start up passively, allocating only a small percentage of the
required budget to compete in your product category? Consequently investing monthly for
up to 3 years, before you see a profit?
Option 2
Money: Will you budget correctly and honestly, and allocate and invest the
required amount from day one, giving you the ability to be aggressive and attack your
market head on, taking market share from day one?
28

www.ecommercegetitright.com
From my experience and after speaking with clients and other online retailers, I can tell you that the
majority of e commerce businesses choose option 1. I personally believe this is because of: (a) Not
planning, forecasting and budgeting; (b) Not being honest with themselves; (c) Fear of failure or
success.
You have heard the old adage that essentially says You can always make more money, but you only
have a limited amount of time. This is really what we are discussing here are you going to join the
97% and invest 3 5 years of struggle, perhaps ultimately quitting with big debts, or do you want
immediate profits and success?
Hot Tip: Do not be afraid to allocate and invest good money where required, especially in
your Start Up e commerce website and marketingIt is far easier to start with a BANG and
compete aggressively from day one, as opposed to tiptoeing into your market.
If You Start Up Passively and Excessively Conservatively, Problems Immediately
Become Apparent:
Your website is not good enough to compete in your chosen product category.
You have little or no traffic due to poor on site and off site SEO and poor marketing.
Your site visitors do not stick (your visitor to sales ratio is shockingly poor) = No Sales!
Continuous website development and investment is required. Added up over 2 to 3 years
this becomes 10 to 100 times more than a solid initial investment would have cost.
As the months and years go by with poor sales, increasing costs and no profits, you get more
disillusioned with the time wasted.
You start to panic and invest irrationally in big numbers with little to no return.
I think you now get the idea!
To sum up this Critical Point
Research  Plan  Forecast  Budget  INVEST  Kick Ass!
Budget & Costs.
Decide from the outset what you have to spend, what you can afford to spend and where you
should allocate and spend this money. Create a simple spreadsheet using Excel or Google Docs. In
the spreadsheet detail what you have to spend as start up costs, and as you progress over the next
12 months to 3 years. I would focus more on the first 12 months with flexibility. Now detail your
business and ongoing costs. Costs are any expense to your business and website, and will include
29

www.ecommercegetitright.com
your site build, site maintenance, general business and marketing costs, and outsourcing or
employees.
You can Split Your Costs into these Four or More Sub Categories:
1) Product Costs may include: Buying products, shipping (delivery), and packaging
2) Website Operational Costs may include: Initial build & launch of site, ongoing costs for site
updates, merchant and transaction fees
3) Business Costs may include:
Office rental, computers, internet access, insurance and
employees
4) Marketing Costs may include: SEO, SEM, Social Media, Offline marketing
Simple Spreadsheet Example:
Basic Financial Spreadsheet Example
Hot Tip: Include as much as possible of your start up site development work, features and
modules in your initial website build, or you may have unnecessary costs as you grow. Brain
dump what you want from the site now, and into the future. Modules and features you do
not need when you launch, can simply be deactivated, until you need them on the live site.
30

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Forecast for Profit.
When you have detailed your costs and budgets, it is time to forecast your sales. These projections
are essentially an estimation based on your research and forecast sales. Be conservative and mark
down how many items you predict you will sell per month and per annum, and multiply this by your
sell price. Then subtract your Cost of Sale, Materials, Stock Sold, Variable Costs or Direct Costs, and
you have your Gross Profit. Then subtract all business overheads (also known as running costs, fixed
costs or indirect costs) at the bottom of your spreadsheet and you have your Net (bottom line)
Profit. This is the important number that means success or failure!
You now have a good idea if your business and e commerce site ideas are viable and profitable. Be
very honest with yourself as most people fail as this point. Look for any leaks in your numbers and
document your actual sales on your spreadsheet, against your forecasted numbers as you start to
trade and progress. This will keep you on track.
Hot Tip: If you plan on holding stock yourself, as opposed to drop shipping (sending direct to
your customer from supplier), these are key costs to include in your forecasts. Holding stock
can be very costly when you need to pay for the product up front. Even if you have a monthly
credit account with your supplier it will need paying for sooner or laterplus you have
warehouse costs and insurance for the stock, etc.
Gross Profit %.
I feel it is important to touch on Gross Profit (GP) again as it is something that many online retailers
simply have no understanding of.
Gross profit is the profit a business would make after the Cost of Sale, Materials, Stock Sold, Variable
Costs or Direct Costs have all been subtracted from your total sales. To simplify: you add up all your
sales and then take away all you had to spend in terms of stock or materials, shipping fees to make
and deliver those products to your customers.
It is critical to determine if there is money to be made, by working out your GP before you decide on
a particular product and market. With online retailing, prices tend to be cheaper than offline. I
know that many online retailers try to work with tiny Gross Profit margins. When they deduct all
overheads (also known as running costs, fixed costs and indirect costs) from their gross profit, they
are left with a miniscule Net Profit or worse still a loss.
Yes, you read that right; many websites are trading at a loss! Youd be better off working for
minimum wage than slaving 7 days a week in your own business for a loss.
Shipping & Delivery Fee Profits.
Shipping charges enable you to make profits on top of your product sale price, so factor this in. If
you are charged $5.95 for shipping one item from your courier (Shipping/Logistics Company) you
may wish to charge the customer $9.95 as an example. However, do your best to keep shipping fees
competitive unless you sell niche and high priced items where you can make really good margins on
shipping.
31

Seasonal Trends.
When forecasting sales you will need to take into consideration your biggest selling months and your
quiet months when sales are low. Depending on the product you are selling sales will peak and
trough throughout the year. No month will be the same and even within each month, you will see a
pattern in sales. For example, as and when your prospects get their monthly paycheck, your sales
will peak. When you have some trading history and actual data to analyze, this will be essential
reading and very important information for you and for your sites success.
Handling Growth.
Naturally as you grow your business, sales will rise but so will your costs. This is the challenge,
keeping costs low as your sales increase. If you grow fast your costs can so easily skyrocketand
often out of controlon things such as stock, PCs and technology, employees and maybe even a
move to larger premises that comes with its own associated costs. So its critical to keep an eye on
your Sales to Costs ratio. Using good accounts software such as Quickbooks or Sage will allow you to
do this, alternatively using a simple spreadsheet will more than suffice.
From the day your website starts trading you must monitor key accounting areas at least weekly
especially your sales and costs, and the resulting net profit (bottom line). Many large companies will
monitor these numbers on an hourly basis giving them the opportunity to respond accordingly with
product prices, site usability and marketing such is the importance of numbers in your business.
I recommend as a minimum you check your Profit & Loss monthly and your balance sheet weekly.
Lifetime Value.
In Step 4 of the book, I detail the power of increasing conversions by using Split Testing and
Multivariate Testing. The internet allows this testing down to minute detail. Even if at first, results
may look too small to be worth the hassle, bear with me.
The premise of Lifetime Value is that for each new customer you get, their worth in money terms to
your company, is calculated over the lifetime of their relationship with you, and not just on the
initial purchase. In addition, they may spend increasingly more money on higher priced items as
your relationship develops over time.
Lifetime Value Example:
Lets say your e commerce website sells guitars and you decide to sell a Learn Guitar book for $10.
You pay your web designer to upload a specific page onto your website to promote and sell the
Learn Guitar book and it costs $100. You then place an advert in Guitar Monthly and it costs you
$120. Total spent $220.
From the advert in Guitar Monthly, you then send prospects (potential customers) directly to your
Learn Guitar book product page on your site. Fifteen people buy your guitar book, which equals
total sales of $150.
$150 Sales  (Learn Guitar product page $100 + Advert $120 = $220) = $70 Loss
32

www.ecommercegetitright.com
However this initial $70 loss in acquiring new customers equates to 15 new customers who may go
on to buy higher priced items such as a guitar and guitar accessories. The concept is like a loss leader
in a supermarket where they lose money on the front end advertised product, to get you to buy
more expensive and profit making products when you get deeper into the store.
Back End Marketing for Profit:
If you now start to email these 15 customersas detailed in Step 2 &4 of the bookstart blogging
and releasing product videos, etc, then one or more of these customers will buy again, taking you
into profit for this one advertising campaign.
a) Lets say 7 of these 15 Learn Guitar book customers do become long term customers and buy
from you each year over a 3 year period
b) Each customer buys 1 guitar per year during this 3 year period
c) Guitar cost to you = $150 and you sell for $300 to customer. You profit $150 per guitar sale
d) 7 repeat customers from the initial advert cost of $70 (which is the total advert/web page
cost of $220 less the sale of $150) this results in each customer costing $10 each to acquire.
($70/7 = $10)
Formula: (a: 3 years) x (b: 1 guitar each per year) x (c: $150 profit)  (d: $10)
Lifetime Value per Customer from this one advert campaign = $440
Group Lifetime Value $440 x 7 = $3080
*Your initial disappointment with a loss of $50 now equates to a net lifetime value of $3080.
Note: In this example there will be costs such as writing the emails and sending them to your
customers; however the cost of email delivery is minimal and inconsequential for this example.
Lifetime Value Formula Simplified:
a) Determine the average number of years a customer will buy from you
b) Calculate the average number of sales a customer will make per year
c) Work out the average profit you make per sale
d) Break down the amount of money it costs you on average to acquire a new customer
(a) x (b) x (c)  (d) = Lifetime Value
We can increase this profit further by implementing the Split Testing & Multivariate Testing detailed
in Step 4 of this book.

2) Your Goal & Exit Strategy.
Decide from the start what the goal of your website is. Ask yourself:
Is it to earn you a part time income or a full time income with financial independence
potential?
Do you want to be the leader or authority in your category or marketplace or are you happy
to be an average player?
Will you sell to retail customers only (B2C  Business to Consumer) or will you also sell to
business or trade customers (B2B  Business to Business), offering them trade discounts?
Do you plan to sell to international customers?
Do you want to become an expert in your products or an expert at e commerce marketing?
There are no right or wrong answers here, but at least get a concrete idea of where you are heading
before you start, and what you will introduce later as your resources grow.
You will never achieve a successful e commerce businessor
any business for that matterworking on recreational time!
Time Investment Required.
If you want to maximize your sales, profits and ultimate success, then you need to factor in the time
you have available for this project or business from the outset. Do not kid yourself with the time,
energy and money that will be required getting to your desired goal. You need to put in the hours,
and even if you outsource (delegate tasks to outside companies or individuals) the majority of tasks,
you still need to keep in touch and watch your outsourcer team, marketing, sales and profits to
remain on target.
Learning Curve.
Building a profitable e commerce business requires a learning curve that will take time. Just like
learning a new software or skill, the hours just fly by when you are highly focused. So be prepared,
accept it, go with it, and do not give yourself too much stick. E commerce is a big animal, with many
processes to learn and refine, so take the positives from the experience and knowledge that you are
gaining.
34

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Product Expert or E commerce Marketing Expert.
You cannot be both types of expert and effectively maximize profits. Unless you have a massive
budget to hire the best of the best in product management and marketing, then being expert in
both is unrealistic and not required. I am not for one minute saying you cannot be a leader in your
product category or niche. But decide now, would you rather know everything there is to know
about your productswhat they do, where they come from, how many widgets they haveor
would you just prefer to sell them in huge numbers with as much product knowledge that enables
this to happen?
Do you think Amazon are experts with their products, or alternatively are they experts at selling and
distribution? Amazon have a data entry system to list products on the websitebe it manually or
automatedusing as much detail, benefits and features as possible, and then use their marketing
expertise to sell them like crazy, using Personalization and Recommendation Systems.
So just to reiterate; absolutely learn your product inside out where requiredif you intend to
control your category or nicheso you can write explosive copy that sells, but dont waste the next
three years taking a degree course on your products whose only consequence would be to limit your
sales. Marketing aggressively is where profits are at!
What is Your Exit Strategy?
Is your aim to run operate the website for as long as you can or do you wish to build the website and
business up, with the aim of selling in 3, 5 or 7 years? If your exit strategy is to sell in 3 years then
detail this in your plan and in your forecasts and watch your targets closely as you progress, to
ensure you keep on track and continually increase the value of your website.
Website Valuation.
At the time of writing, websites sell for around 12 times Net Profit Earnings so bear this in mind.
Net earnings are what the site makes in Net Profit in twelve months. Many publications will tell you
that you can get anywhere from 312 times net earnings but in my experience aim for 12 times
net. Maybe you can get more for the next YouTube but not for a profitable e commerce site.
Selling to International Customers.
Selling globally can add a huge increase to your sales volume and net profits with a potential
audience of billions. Run the research for international customers using the research tools detailed
in 3) Do the Research. When you look at your site user stats, you will be surprised how many
international prospects actually visit your website.
Note: You need to watch the exchange rate closely when selling overseas and determine if you can
buy products competitively enough to compete with suppliers in the country of your shoppers.
35

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Trade Accounts (B2B).
Offering trade customersbusiness to business (B2B)the option to buy at discounted prices can
further boost site sales. You can give discounts by a set amount or set percentage. By way of a
simple trade application form on your website, you can entice trade customers to apply for a trade
discount and get them into the e commerce trade module in your Content Management System
(CMS) back end. You manage your trade specifics and applications in there.
You can then approve the account and set the required discount for each specific trade customer.
Communication with your trade buyers is also possible, with regards their approved discounts to
their specific accounts, via automated emails, synchronized with the trade account. Additionally you
can set credit card only accounts or even offer 30 day credit accounts, whereby 30 day invoices are
raised and emailed automatically.

3) Do the Research.
Before you start an e commerce website, it is critical you put in a good days work and do the
research. Competitor, Keyword and Product Research all need to be carried out to prevent you
entering a market where there is little or no demand (prospects) with potentially too much supply
(competitors)or just the fact that the product you intend to sell has a market, but that market is
not online. Having discipline and putting in the research time now can prevent years of headaches,
pain, and stress and ultimately save you a lot of cash in the process.
What if you do enter a market with a small amount of customers and lots of competitors? This may
equal disasterunless you totally dominate this niche. However, niche too often equals to small
market and small profits. You want to enter a niche category within a big product category. Such as
DVD players as a niche category within the main Home Entertainment category.
Competitor Analysis & Research.
Competitor Analysis is about assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your current and potential
competitorsfinding your competitive edgeand has two primary objectives:
1) Obtaining information about important competitors
2) Using that information to predict competitor behavior
The Goal of Competitor Analysis is to Understand:
Which competitors to compete against and to go head to head with
Competitors' strategies and planned actions
How competitors might react to your market entry and subsequent actions
How to influence competitor behavior to your own advantage
Simplified, this means you need to go to the Google search engine and start looking at your future
competitors websites.
Ask Yourself These Questions:
Are your competitors websites good or poor quality?
What products, features and services do they offer?
Who comes up in the top 10 search results for your top keyword terms?
Is their On Site and Off Site SEO work of high quality or mediocre?
Do they advertise with Google Adwords (Pay per Click) or focus on search engines only?
How many ads do they run and do they have a large budget?
Can you compete, give them a good run for their money, and take sales and market share
from them?
38

www.ecommercegetitright.com
What is your competitive edge, your Unique Selling Proposition (USP), where can you excel
where your competitors do not?
There are various tools available to carry out solid competitor research prior to launching your
website, and also once you are trading. These allow you to watch your competitors behavior,
including their site and product updates.
Tools to Help You Monitor Competitor & Market Activity:
Google Alerts: www.google.com/alerts
Copernic Tracker: www.copernic.com/en/products/tracker/index.html
Keyword Research.
Use the keyword tools on offersuch as Googles free Google Adwords Research Toolor use a
subscription service like Wordtracker.com as these will give you a good idea about the market you
are about to enter. This involves running searches for your top keywords, seeing what online
searchers are actually typing into the search engines, analyzing the results and making your product
decisions or site content based on this.
When you have the data, mix these numbers with your common sense and intuition. And I say this
because you may find some keywords that you absolutely know are major search terms, are
showing as low volume on the keyword tools.
My best advice here is to go to the two sites below, read the help files and simply have a go, and
utilize the export to CSV/Excel option. You will soon understand what they are about and this will
give you a good overview of your market supply and demand.
Google Adwords Tool: https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal
Wordtracker: www.wordtracker.com/
Hot Tip: When exporting to CSV or Excel, before you sort the key phrases into your desired
order, insert a new column in A and number the key phrases top to bottom. This helps you to
reorder the spreadsheet and key phrases into the original exported order, should you wish
later on.
Product Research.
Just like with competitor research, get out onto Google and see what products your competitors are
selling and the price they sell them for. You will soon get a good picture of what sells and what does
not and if there is profit to be made. Tie this in with your Keyword research and you will establish
39

www.ecommercegetitright.com
what products your prospects are searching for (demand). Worldwide brands are just one popular
product research tool found online:
WorldWideBrands: www.worldwidebrands.com

4) Where Will You Provide Value?
Business is a value for value exchange. Therefore, the question is; can you do things exceptionally
well and give your customers great value and the WOW factor? Many e commerce websites and
businesses are mediocre at best, in all areas from design to customer service. What is your
competitive edge? Where will you excel and go that bit further than your competitors?
Price Is Not Everything.
Do you have a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) and offer something your competitors do not? If its
a lower price, remember that being cheaper does not always mean you will get the sale. Every
potential customer is different and people have different buying personalities that can fluctuate.
Many people do not want cheap and cheerful products, so a lower price is only good for some
people and some products but not for others.
Perception and perceived value also comes into this equation. Find your target customer and sell to
them at the recommended price. Ask your supplier for their thoughts on price. By testing various
priceson the live websitewill show you within a week, what your best sell price is, by the
number of sales made.
41

www.ecommercegetitright.com
5) Who is Doing What in the Business?
Do you intend to handle everything yourself or will you have employees and will you outsource
some of the tasks? Will you be holding and handling stock (inventory) or will you use a fulfillment
center (also known as a fulfillment house), that can do just about everything for you, from taking
phone calls, handling emails to delivering products to customers and even handling returns?
Outsourcing.
Outsourcing simply means giving a specific role or project to an outside company or individual.
Many of the outsource websites including Elance.com, Freelancer.com or Guru.com have a plethora
of people waiting to handle your project.
However a big word of warning; the majority of providers are yes men and will claim they can do
anything you ask or give them. But in my experience of using over a 100 different outsource
companies or individuals for various projects from logo design, through data entry to web
development, I can guarantee you that at least 7080% are mediocre at best.
Am I saying all outsourcers are bad? No, and you could effectively run your whole business this way
like the very successful Double Your Dating company does. What I am saying is this: take your time
hiring someone and select outsourcers with a high positive feedback and absolutely interview them
(or grill them even) prior to hiring them. Do not pay any money up front until you have worked with
them and are happy with their skills (where possible), and get them to sign a contract that covers
various points. See Hiring a Web Designer in Step 3 for more on this type of contract.
Time.
Typical daily e commerce projects or tasks include: web design and development, sales, operations,
customer and technical support, copy writing and web content, images, data entry, marketing and
SEO.
So take into consideration what you or your team can handle and how you can save time, energy
and money by outsourcing, employing staff or by using a fulfillment company. Outsource and
fulfillment companies will even handle operations such as order processing, product shipping,
returns and refunds. However, I like to keep a few of these operational tasks in house to ensure the
service provided is optimum.
Many outsourcers are self employed individuals that are also employed fulltime elsewhere, so bear
this in mind when hiring them. If you have timelines to meet with regards completing areas of your
project or launching the website, etc, then all targets need to be agreed and documentedin the
contract prior to starting.
42

www.ecommercegetitright.com
6) Sales & Customer Support.
Exceptional Sales and Customer Supportalso known as Customer Serviceis the foundation to
every successful e commerce business. A Sales Person is the frontline contact with prospects before
they buyand contact to your company is by email or phone. Customer Support is after the sale,
again by email and phoneif you offer this option. I recommend you offer phone sales & support as
it says so much more about your company than those who hide behind email. If required you can
use separate phone numbers for sales and support.
The way you handle customer sales & support enquiries can seriously
affect your reputation and consequently your sales.
Response Time.
Statistics suggest that on average a customer will visit up to seven websites prior to making a buying
decision. Of those seven sites, they will email approximately 30 percent with a product enquiry and
questions. The interesting thing is they copy and paste the same email question to each website
awaiting a fast response. Customers have no loyalty to one website.
So, aim for the WOW factor! When a prospect emails your sales department, the faster you reply,
the better the chance of converting this enquiry into a sale ahead of your competitors. Respond in
minutes where possible and aim for under an hour.
Attention to Detail.
If you take your time to read customers email enquiries and respond to all questions and points
raised, with speed and accuracy of responses and with politeness, then in my experience they will
buy from you and forget the rest. When I have personally emailed companies for information I
estimate about 50%70% actually read and responded to the email exactly, some gave blunt
answers and many did not even answer some of the questions. This just causes frustration for the
prospect and the sale is lost.
Being an online marketer I have spent a few bucks to bolster my own education with the big US
based Internet Marketers
these guys utilize clinical sales funnels to sell products. However, when
you contact their customer support desks or email supportfrom my experience and from all
accounts reading the forums online from many other peoples experiences, (just search for [internet
marketers name] scam)the level of support these guys offer is pretty poor to say the least.
Contrast this with a reputable e commerce company such as Amazon.com. The support you receive
there is exceptionalin my personal experience.
43

www.ecommercegetitright.com
So would I recommend a company that offers poor customer service? Absolutely not! Would I
recommend a company where I had a great buying & support experience such as Amazon? You bet I
would!
Therefore, this word of mouth advertising, positive or negative is critical to your bottom line
profits. I am sure you have heard the saying When you have a good experience you tell your close
friends and when you have a bad experience you tell everyone. This is Word of Mouth Advertising in
action.
Word of Mouth (WOM).
WOM Marketing can promote and even explode your business, spreading like a virus, and simply
because you did the right thin.
Youve heard of viral marketing, like when a YouTube video spreads like a virusand has millions of
views in days just because its funny or weird. The same thing can happen on a smaller scale, if
you can convert an unhappy customer into one who is delighted with the way you responded to
their support query and resolved their problem fast. They will rapidly swing from a negative emotion
towards your company, to one of highly excited sales person! You have to see this in action to
believe how powerful it can be. So where possible, help and resolve customer queries fast, sticking
to your principles!
Customer Problems.
In Step 1, 13 Common E commerce Mistakes I touched on not being a slave to your customers
demands. To elaborate on this I want mention customer mindset. Everybody on this planet has their
own problemsincluding your customersand their current mindset and personality is determined
by current events. For example if your customer has booked a day off work to receive their order
and the courier fails to deliver for whatever reason this can be the final straw, the trigger for your
customer to lose it! They then phone you up and give you or your team an earful of their frustration.
However, customers can also get worked up over very minor things. So as soon as you can, decide
on a rule or measure to what degree you will stand for any bad attitude, bad language, insults, etc,
to protect your employees. I do not say this to scare you, but it can happen occasionally. If youve
done everything rightapologized, explained the reasons why and taken the appropriate action to
resolve the problem and fastand the customer still insists on being awkward or using abusive
language, then maybe you need to terminate the relationship!
Rule of 3.
In my office, my team and I decided to practice a Rule of 3. This essentially gives the customer three
chances. We at first apologized and explained how we would resolve the issues promptly. Then if the
customer continued to raise their voice, swear and be verbally abusive, then we would repeat our
recommended course of action, looking for the customers cooperation. On the 3rd insult we would
simply say OK, heres what I would like you to do, please package the product up securely and return
to the address Im about to email you, Thank you, Goodbye and end the call.
44

www.ecommercegetitright.com
You may think this is not required for your business and that is fine. However, what you will quickly
learn is that when a customer is in a negative state of mind, the law of attraction swings into action
and everything continues to go wrong for them. As an example: if they have received a faulty
product and you then send a replacementyou will find the replacement will not get there in one
piece. It is as if they make it happen!
You will not get many of these customers but when you do, they can drain staff morale and sap your
energy and enthusiasm so fast. Ultimately, your job is to provide exceptional quality products and
service. Your job description does not include insults or verbal abuse from customerregardless of
your customers problems.
Support Center Software.
When you launch your site, you may want to start with a simple contact form and traditional email.
However, once you get more trafficand as a consequence more sales and support enquiries
using good support software and modifying it to fit your business can give you big advantages over
your competitors.
Support Center Customer Benefits.
Good support software keeps things organized. Emails/tickets are all located in one area with a
secure login. You will maximize efficiency, email enquiries can be answered faster, and all history per
contact is logged. Customers can select the website and/or department they required from drop
downs menus on a webpage, if you have multiple websites and departments.
Support Center Company Benefits & Features.
Good software like this also has secure individual user login so all email/tickets are assigned to each
specific user. You get all kinds of statistics and features; all of the support emails are split by
department and/or website, the senders full details, time, comments, which employee responded,
your notes, etc. Its all tracked. All of these processes can be automated, synchronized and even
outsourced easily.
In addition, if you have multiple websites in a network as I did, this enables all websites to link to the
one support center for easy management. You can also display best selling products on the support
center home page, so when prospects or customers contact you for Pre Sale enquiries they may
see an attractive deal and place an order. When the contact form is submitted, the prospect is
presented with a contact confirmation page just like you get after placing an order and having gone
through the checkout. This is where you can position newsletter email opt in forms, RSS
subscriptions, special deals, best sellers, and links to other sites, and so on.
Outsource Sales & Support.
Additional benefits are; you can outsource the support to an outsource company or individual that is
accessible via the web 24/7. I had two fulltime employees in India running my sales and support
center, handling the support and technical support enquiries for one of my site networks. This
worked very well and they synchronized perfectly with my employees in the UK sales office.

Popular Support Center Software:
Kayako: www.kayako.com/ (paid)
eTicket: www.eticketsupport.com/ Open source (free)
I have used both of the above software products and both can be modified to fit your specific needs.
Kayako has more features, but is more complex to use and modify. I spent a bit of time reworking
eTicket support to fit my exact specification and prefer to use this now as it is clean, simple and does
all I need with the option of flexibility if I need to make changes.

Popular Live Chat Software:
I wont say much about these as I recommend you check out the different live support companies in
Google; features and prices change often between the different software brands. My favorite two
out of the ones I have tried are:
Live Person: http://solutions.liveperson.com/live chat/
PHP Live: www.phplivesupport.com/
My preference is Live Person although it is quite expensive for a start up website. I would only
recommend you use this software product when you get more visitors. Live chat software can build
trust quickly as customers know they can reach you rapidly and immediately. Live Person offers
some great statistics like those offered by Google Analytics. I also like to use LP because the chat
window is 100% secure, so you can take orders from customers through this window.
Note: I recommend you negotiate on price when you speak with your LP representative; they always
bend on price to get your order.
Email Reliability.
Monitor your email delivery rates with feedback from customers. Get a feel for your email reliability
on a regular basis, run tests, and check to see if customers are receiving it. Is your email being
blocked by their email client spam filters or worse is it being blocked on their servers? I have had
experiences where the email service provided by certain hosting companies has been blacklisted by
customers because of spam issues in the past. If your emails are not reaching customers email
inboxes, then communication and sales will be negatively affected.
48

7) Product Buying & Management.
To source product suppliers and distributors you can start offline by looking in retail and trade
magazines, visiting trade shows, and approaching local and national brick and mortar companies.
Online you can start with companies such as WorldWideBrands.com, or just search on Google for
your products, using terms like MP3 Player Distributor or MP3 player trade suppliers.
Popular Product Source Tool with Integrated Research Tools.
WorldWideBrands: www.worldwidebrands.com/
Considerations when Selecting a Product.
If you have not yet decided on a product range to sell, consider the following:
Is there profit in the product?
Will your supplier grant you (full) exclusivity on the product?
Is the product patent protected?
Customer demand: what is Your product life cycle until people stop wanting it?
Supplier: are they reliable, how good is their warranty & returns process, what are their long
term plans?
Is support and technical help available from your suppliers and how (email, phone)?
How big is the product range? are new products planned?
Buying Products.
When buying products, always start by asking your suppliers for trade price lists and bulk buy tier
structures as they often give bigger discounts if you buy in larger quantities. When you are ready to
order, always negotiate on their prices and ask what special deal you can have for buying in bulk
quantities. Tell them you intend to shift a boatload so you get a great deal. As your business grows
and you spend more with your suppliers, continue to negotiate on price at least every 3 6 months.
Gray Imports or Replicas.
The internet is a hot spot for gray imports and replica products. A gray import is the genuine
product, but sourced from a foreign market where prices are typically a lot cheaper and
specifications are sometimes slightly different. The biggest issue with true gray imports (not knock
off clones or replicas) is the manufacturers warranty and whether this is honored. Gray market
items are predominantly sold on the internet or through wholesale channels where it is difficult for
the buyer to properly inspect the product prior to buying.
49

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Product Warranty.
Establish the warranty period of each product. For example, many products come with a standard 12
months manufactures warranty. Generally, gray imported products will not have warranty cover.
Therefore, it is important to clearly establish the warranty and returns process as inevitably some
products will break down.
Check the Following with Your Supplier:
Does your customer return directly to wholesaler or manufacturer?
Do they return to you and then you return to wholesaler or manufacturer, or is there a third
party company that handles or repairs your product?
What are the timelines, logistics and costs on the above scenarios?
Number of Products.
Decide if you will sell a few products, hundreds of products or even thousands or tens of thousands
of products. Selling fewer products results in less work and gives you more of a niche positioning of
your e commerce website. However, on the flip side the more product pages you have in Google or
the other search engines, the more entry points your prospects will have, and the easier it will be for
them to find your site.
Product Data Entry.
You can do this yourself or you can outsource this laborious process. If you outsource you may need
to modify and improve the descriptions laterto add a sales edge. You will need brochures, images,
descriptions and prices (where available). Your supplier may have all these in a spreadsheet CSV file,
so you can import them directly into your e commerce back end admin for maximum speed.
Data Feeds.
Data entry of your products and real time stock updates of your products can be automated, if your
supplier or distributer offers this service. Data feeds are a way of integrating a real time stock
databasecommonly including products descriptions, images and pricesfrom your suppliers
main system into your website.
This is an ideal tool if you do not hold your own stock, and makes for optimum efficiency. Whenever
your suppliers update the stock or prices change, this is change is immediately reflected in your
websites stock level numbers, and in real time on your live website. The large computer component
companies use this model to keep on top of the rapid changes to stock levels. To do this manually
if you dont hold your own stockwould be next to impossible, or would require full time
employees in house or outsource, working around the clock.
50

www.ecommercegetitright.com
8) Drop Ship, Hold Stock or Fulfillment.
Before you set up your e commerce website you will need to decide if youll be holding stock, drop
shipping your products (delivery direct from your supplier to customer) or using a fulfillment service
for handling any aspect of the operations process (pre sales to shipping).
Hold Stock.
If you hold your own stock, you will need money to invest in this up front, unless your supplier offers
a monthly credit account. In addition, you will need a warehouse or stock area and all the necessary
insurance. Depending on your website modelif you have live online stock levelsyou would also
add to this a stocking system linked to and displaying real time stock levels on your live site, and a
shipping/tracking system all synchronized by your e commerce back end admin.
Drop Shipping.
This simply means sending products direct from your supplier to your customer. When you get an
order, you will email, fax or phone the order and customer details to your supplier who then drop
ships the product. Where possible get a daily report of items shipped from your drop shipper so you
can then inform your customer.
If you drop ship you will not be offered quantity buy discounts on products. However, buying drop
shipped products at a discount is definitely achievable if you negotiate.
Drop Ship Discounts are Achievable:
1) If you buy and ship in single orders, the total will accumulate over time, equivalent to a one
off bulk buy.
2) If you buy in bulk and store these products at the drop shippers premises.
You can choose to hold stock (shipping products yourself) and drop ship products where required.
This depends on the products, supplier, shipping costs and the money available to purchase stock.
Problem: Your supplier may accidentally or intentionally put his company name on the shipping
label that your close trade competitors may get hold of.
Problem: Your supplier mistakenly includes your trade invoice in the boxthat your customer then
receives. This does not look professional and a tough one to explain.
Solution: Stipulate in advance to your drop shipper that you categorically do not want any company
labels on the packaging and No Paperwork in the Box when they ship your products.
Ordering Products.
You can place product orders from suppliers via email, fax or phone: in bulk, or in single units from
your drop shipper. Simply put your name, your customers name and shipping address, along with
the item and quantity required. For maximum efficiency and productivity, you can set your
51

www.ecommercegetitright.com
ecommerce system to synchronize with your orders and print an order form ready for you to email
or fax to your suppliers.
Your customer will receive the order invoice via email automatically from you when they order, so
you essentially have a paperless office.
Hot Tip: Some suppliers may charge a fee per item for providing a drop shipping service.
Also be aware if you choose to buy in bulk and store at the drop shippers, they may want to
charge you for this. If they do negotiate, remember that you are selling their products and
that they should accommodate your set up and processes where possible!
Fulfillment.
Some companiesknown as a fulfillment center or fulfillment housenormally independent of
your suppliers, will do and handle everything for you: from taking phone calls, answering emails,
holding and delivering stock to handling returns. Some fulfillment companies also manufacturer
specific products such as CDs and DVDs including the branding and artwork for the packaging.
These services come at a price and may reduce your profit margins too far to justify using them.
Check with your product suppliers to see if they can offer you these services. Even if they do not
offer it currently, they may make an exception for you, especially if you sell in large numbers.

9) Shipping & Logistics.
I recommend that you decide what shipping options, methods and services you plan on offering to
your online customers, before you start on your website development.
Will you use one shipping company or multiple ones, depending on the product and/or
country?
Will you use the national postal service as a cheaper option?
Alternatively, will you give multiple service, price and country options?
Speak with a few shipping companies, get price tariffs, and ask about bulk shipping discounts, and
what targets you can aim for as you grow and ship in higher quantities. The more you ship, the
cheaper each delivery will cost. Also, establish who your competitors use, and other sites you like
and trust for ideas.
Shipping Costs.
You need to weigh up the shipping costs you charge to your customers. Decide if they will be free
and absorbed in the product price or if you will charge an extra shipping fee on top of the product
price. What shipping services will you offer? Next Day Guaranteed or a slower service, and will you
give various price options? Offering different shipping options gives customers flexibility, as many
people are at work Monday to Friday, and may only want their product delivered when they take a
specific day off. A next day shipping option would give them this flexibility.
Hot Tip: You may make savings on shipping fees if you ship the products yourself, this can
make a huge difference to your profits.
Failed Delivery.
Things do not always go to plan when using third party shipping companies. So expect it, and be
ready to get reimbursements when things go wrong: weather delays in winter, busy periods like
Christmas and holidays, broken down vans, theft, etc. All of these and more can affect shipping
times.
If your customer is out when your courier attempts delivery, you will normally get 2 to 3 more
attempts at no extra charge, before your product is Returned to Sender. You can then resend the
item to your customerbut be sure to bill them again for shipping, as your courier will charge you.
Detail this in your website shipping terms and conditions in the help or support section of your site.
53

Shipping Options.
The more shipping options you offer, the more complex your website shipping module will be. So
plan ahead, get all the required data into a spreadsheet and hand this to your site developer to
import into your site, and things will run smoothly from here. In the shipping module, you can
stipulate different prices, different services (Next Day, 2 Day, 1st Class, and 2nd Class), different
countries and different weights.

10) Returns.
It is important to check for any distance selling regulations and returns policies for your specific
country, and to detail them on your website. In the UK there is a 7 Day Distance Selling Regulation
called the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000. This means a customer can
return a product within 7 days, if bought online or by mail order. This is called a cooling off period
and must be detailed on your websiteusually in the help or customer support section. Many
online retailers or customers are not aware of such return policies.
Money Back Guarantees.
In addition to this standard 7day policy, I always give at least a 30day or more Money Back
Guarantee for one simple reason; it removes the perceived risk from your customers purchase and
builds trust, resulting in more sales. You may not have to give as much as 30 Days or more. Try 7
days, 14 days, 21 days, etc, and test the returns/refunds percentage. However, highlight the
guarantee that you give on your website to build immediate trust.
In many tests offering and advertising an explicit No Risk Money Back Guarantee suggests the risk
is removed from your customers buying decision, and more sales are made as a result. Refund rates
will be different for each product, customer type, market, business positioning, website, sales and
quality of after sales support you provide.
Reduce Returns.
Offer and honor your returns guarantee. However, you do not have to make it too easy to return
goods; how you do this is entirely up to you. For example, I would advise against displaying your
returns address on your website. This would make returning goods too easy, and your systems
would not be able to track returns efficiently.
Moreover, this is not for anything other than to ensure that a customer wishes to return the product
for the correct reasons. I say this as many customers struggle with the most simplest of products or
procedures; be it set up problems, operation or technical issues, looks too complex, didn't work, I
can't install it, install costs too much, etc. So help them out with their product issues and your
returns rate will plummet.
Returns Process.
My websites have a returns process in place giving the customer every reason to keep their product.
I say this because they really want to keep the product. The process goes like this. A customer raises
a returns requestthrough the returns link inside of their user account. They are then presented
with a returns email confirmation page, on this website page it explains; why they shouldn't return
the product just yet, what the top five technical issues are and how these can easily be resolved,
where to find PDF manuals to download and where to find help guides and help videos in the
support center pages. In addition, an email is automatically sent to them, with the same
55

www.ecommercegetitright.com
information.
You can track your returns in the back end site admin area, or by spreadsheet, and a returns rate
percentage should be determined, on a monthly basis at least. My average returns rate across
multiple websites was 2.7%, and the internet average for physical products I believe is 510% plus.
When you establish your returns rate, you can then hone and refine your returns process to get it
reduced by any means possible.
Suspected Faulty Products.
There are various ways you can handle this. You firstly need to establish if the products you have
sent are indeed faulty. The majority will not be. So using the ideas above ensure your customer goes
through your problem resolution process, has access to help guides, installation guides,
Troubleshooting and Fault Diagnosis guides and videos where possible. In addition phone them up if
required.
My employees or I often phoned customers up directly to establish the reason for return and to help
sort the problem out fast. Do not be afraid to speak with customers. Often a quick call can sort a
problem in minutesthis will result in them cancelling their return request and profits from the sale
remain in your bank account.
Replacement Product for Testing.
Depending on what products you sell, sometimes you will need to send out a replacement product
or perhaps just an individual part only. In such a scenario, you can do one of two things.
Option 1: Send the replacement product or part in good faith at no cost to the customer.
Here you need to stipulate what to do if the product is in fact faulty and how and where to
return itto you or to your supplier.
Stipulate a return by date for either the faulty product or the replacement.
You need to detail that if the faulty or replacement is not returned within X days (mine was
30 days) you will bill their card accordingly.
They must return the faulty or replacement product to you using a tracking number for their
protection to insure against loss or damage. You could even send them a pre addressed
padded envelope bag, etc. I did in some cases. But If it has a big box, dont bother.
Option 2: Send the replacement product or part and bill the customer.
Stipulate that upon receipt of the faulty or replacement product you will refund them in full.
Stipulate a return by date for either the faulty product or the replacement.
They must return the faulty or replacement product to you using a tracking number for their
protection to insure against loss or damage. As in Option 1, you could even send them a pre
addressed padded envelope bag, etc. depending on the type of product and its original
packaging.
56

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Collecting Products.
If you wish, you can offer free returns like many catalogue and clothing websites offer. Just make
sure to factor this into your prices and evaluate how much it costs you in returns employees and
software to handle thisas you will definitely get more returns as a result. You could even offer a
collection service for customers, be it free, or at a cost to the customer. This will definitely give you a
Unique Selling Proposition (USP) but will also cost you time, money and employees to operate
smoothly!
Repeat Return Offenders.
The need to reduce returns is important to reach higher profits. Typically, 80% of your returns will
come from 20% of your products. So establish if specific products are breaking down and if they are,
consider dropping them from your range if they are serial return offenders. Then investigate further
to see if you are getting returns because your customer support is poor, for example. Are your
emails excessively slow in response? Do you ignore the phone for long periods of the day, with the
result that your customers trust has waned? Do you need to include more install and technical
manuals or PDFs in the box or on website as support? All are important areas to look at.
RAM Number.
A Returns Authorization Number is generated by your e commerce software returns module, and is
your way of tracking customers returned products. If your product range does not a have high
returns rate, this system may be unnecessary. Many return requests can be reversed by phoning
customers to assist themas mentioned abovein addition to advertising on your website that a
RAM number is a mandatory requirement before they can send the item back to you. This is
because to get this number they must follow a step by step returns protocol exactly. This gives you
the chance to assess, address and reverse their request for a return.
Hot Tip: If drop shipping, establish what your suppliers returns policy is for faulty products. If
customers send items to you, make sure you have enough space available to store them.

Legal Considerations for Selling Online.
The law in your specific country and internationally is an essential consideration when planning to
sell products online. Each country has its own legal rules and terms. The list below uses the UK as an
example, but I recommend taking professional advice from the e retail industry bodies in your
country.
A Brief Overview of Items that are Often Within Distance Selling Regulations:
You must give clear and detailed information about the goods and services you offer on your
website, including product prices and shipping.
When a customer has ordered you must send them conformation. This can be in way of an
automated email acknowledgement.
Delivery of products should be made within 30 days of the order date, unless otherwise
stated.
Your customer has the right to cancel an order within 7 working days (MondayFriday). This
period runs from the day after the delivery date.
The effective date of a cancellation is the date on which your customer raised the
cancellation with you
Your customer must cancel in writing, be it email, returns process on your site, by letter or
fax
A refund must be actioned as soon as you can but within 30 days maximum
You can request that the goods are returned within a set period or as soon as possible
You can collect the goods yourself via courier if agreed, be it at a cost or free of charge

Multi Channel Considerations
Are
you
planning
to
sell
both
online
and
offline?
This
is
multi channel
trading.
At the time of writing E commerce accounts for over 30% of all retail sales worldwide and
demonstrates that mixing the two sales channels can be explosive when working in synergy;
especially when you run marketing strategies such as Buy Online, Collect in Store.
When Trading Through Multi Channels There are a Number of Elements to Consider
when building your website and in Preparation for Hiring a Web Designer and
Employees:
What overall budget are you allocating to the initial setup of your website? Have you
compared this with existing and similar live websites, ensuring it is a realistic figure?
Are you planning to offer the same, selected or additional products on your e commerce site
compared to your offline store?
Will you be synchronizing your online and offline prices to between website and offline
systems at all times, including sale periods?
How much overlap will there be between your online and offline sales operations, deliveries to
stores and returns to stores?
Will you be offering a Buy Online, Collect in Store service?
What shipping options and methods do you plan to offer your online buyers and will these be
additional to your existing arrangements?
Have you budgeted for all online and offline running costs and how will you measure the
profitability of the site against that of your offline channel?
What contact points will you have on the site? For example, an address and landline phone
number is important for credibility.
How much time have you budgeted for testing the site before going live?
Will you be selling to US, UK, Europe or Worldwide and do you need to consider setting up
international languages and currencies?
Do you have a compelling launch event planned to promote the tie in of your new site with
your existing offline business, which will attract the local press?
An e commerce website should be updated often. How will you manage and coordinate
design and product updates between your online and offline operations?

Planning Your Website Development
Before you start building your e commerce website, lets take a closer look at the essential elements
and software options at your disposal. These are choices that will mean long term success or
imminent failure.
Web Design & Development: In house, Outsource or DIY?
There are four main e commerce software and technology options available to you when starting an
e commerce website project. With some good, robust and reliable pre built systems available, you
do not have to reinvent the wheel.
Four E commerce Software Solution Options
1) Boxed Solution.
When you purchase out of the box software, you create your own pages possibly from basic
templates in the software, add the content and away you go. Sounds easy and it is, but your site
will stink! Not recommended if you want big sales and big profits. You will need to invest many
hours amending your website, constantly trying to improve the design, usability and operation.
The reality is that there are very real limitations to how your site will look and perform. So select
this option only, if you are on a very tight budget, and enjoy hard, laborious work.
2) Custom / Bespoke Solution.
Build a Custom and Bespoke e commerce website to fit your exact needs, by using an external
design company. This method starts by giving a specification brief to establish your
requirements and because the company is starting from scratch, your site can cost up to five
times that of using a branded solution as in number three.
3) Branded Software.
Use established and reputable e commerce branded software, built and designed by an external e
commerce specialist company. This is my recommended option for a website that delivers on all
your feature requirements, for the best investment. However, not all e commerce software is
created equal, so you need to follow the information below.
4) In House Team.
Use an in house team or employees and resources available to your company. Generally, this
involves building a bespoke site from the ground up. This is often perceived as the more cost
effective solution if your company already has an IT team with web design and development
experience. However, you will quickly find out the costs frequently outweigh the profits using this
60

www.ecommercegetitright.com
model. Employees, plus hardware, plus software can easily reach $160K (£100K) in year one.
Software Options 2 and 3.
Using an external web development company to build your e commerce website, requires you to
decide upon and hand over a specification list of the features and modules you require to your short
listed companies, allowing them to give you a Yes or No on your requested feature list. Each
company will then respond with a quotation based on your site spec.
What software do I recommend?
I have used three boxed solution e commerce software, three branded software, and one bespoke
e commerce system. The branded software option is my personal preference when you make it
exactly as you want it, by adding your own bespoke elementsif these are not already included as
standard. I have experienced exceptional results customizing and super charging the popular
osCommerce software with bespoke modules and features to fit my specific website needs.
However there are many great e commerce branded solutions on the market now and you will
quickly learn what to look out for in the following pages. All you have to do is (1) decide on your
budget, (2) highlight the features you want, (3) hire a designer and get your website started.

Key Elements of an E commerce Website
To build and launch a successful e commerce website there are many elements and skills required.
Every area must be as strong as the next, or the weak link will let the whole business down. Think
about this; you have a store in a virtual location that must attract and convert visitors into buyers.
You must approach this differently than you would a regular offline store.
A successful project requires the input of website designers, developers, graphic designers,
conversion and usability specialists, and on and offline marketing and retail professionals. They will
all contribute to your website. Once you have learned and internalized the insider information
within this chapter, you have the tools to launch a highly profitable e commerce website.
1) Domain and Hosting.
A successful e commerce website starts with a good domain name also known as a URL (Uniform
Resource Locator), and good branding based on your product, category and positioning. I
recommend that the first step you take when selecting your domain name is to include your main
keyword or key phrase and then brand it. Unless you have a few hundred thousand dollars to brand
your website each month, then do your best to build a brand from day one, by adding a great,
memorable and recognizable logo to your domain name. This does not have to be costly, but
remember that a good domain name, nice logo and great sales and support will stand you in good
stead.
3 Quick Examples from Websites I Used to Own:
1) CarAudioPlus.co.uk
where Car Audio = key phrase, and Plus' = Brand
2) iPodCarKitDirect.co.uk
iPodCarKit= key phrase, and Direct = Branding
3) InCariPod.com
a perfect domain name as it is a top key phrase in itself and also great for
branding
A few online marketing gurus will tell you that its not important to
have your key phrase in your domain name, but in my intensive testing,
this advice is wrong
66

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Why You Need to Use your Main Keyword in Your Domain Name:
1) Your website will be easy for customers and prospects to remember, if your main industry
product phrase is within your name, especially if it is short and succinct.
2) The second critical reason for having your top keyword, or key phrase in your domain name
is all about incoming links, especially free or (natural links). Links (real name hyperlinks) are
the Holy Grail when it comes to SEO, and getting above your competitors in the search
engines. Links are detailed later on in the book, but essentially the more links pointing to
your website, the better.
People may link to your websitebecause they deem it a good resource for their website visitors
from blog, forum and social site chatter. If you follow this tip and place your key phrase in your
domain name then you will automatically get good high quality links. This is because people linking
to your website will frequently use your website name in the link text itself. This text in the link
what people click on to get back to your websiteis called the anchor text. Search engines often
attach more importance to a link if the anchor text is directly related to the theme of your site via a
relevant keyword, which is the case when your domain name, containing the keyword, is included in
this anchor text.
Selecting a Domain Name.
Its tough when selecting a domain name, especially if you want a .com, .co.uk or other top level
domain (TLD), for your particular country, as many have already been registered. When creating a
name do your best to keep it as short as possible3 or 4 words maxand make it memorable. Use
your keywords and branding as detailed above, and if you are using more than one wordand
where feasiblelook at using a theme like Coca Cola, Audio Assault or Toms Taxis. These are highly
recognizable and memorable!
Buying Domains.
I can make two recommendations on where to buy your domain names: US based, or
internationally, buy them from GoDaddy.com. Based in the UK, buy them from 123 reg.co.uk. When
you have registered your domain name, you can then forward the Name Servers to where your
website is hosted making your website live. This ensures you remain in full control of your domain
name now and into the future. It is essential you retain full ownership of your domain name at all
times.
Domain Name Sellers:
GoDaddy.com: www.godaddy.com (US and Global customers)
123 Reg: www.123 reg.co.uk (UK customers)
67

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Hosting.
Select a reputable host for your website to ensure you get good bandwidth, good load speed,
maximum uptime and visibility. You need your website to stay live and online 24/7/365. The
company that designs your website may even provide hosting, which many companies do. However,
ensure their support response is rapid if your site ever goes down, or if you need help with
something else site related.
Research and read customer reviews online for good uptime ratings to get some feedback, prior to
signing up to any specific company.
68

www.ecommercegetitright.com
2) Design.
When selecting a designer or design teamsee Step (3) for hiring tipsit is important to be aware
that not all web designers are equal. Choose the right designer and watch your profits soar. Choose
the wrong designer and experience 618 months or more of sheer frustration, just waiting for your
new website to be built and launched.
Your website design is the main element in determining if visitors will stay or leave. On entering your
website you will have 57 seconds to hold your visitors attention or they will bounce and will be
gone forever CLICK. So help your visitor make the should I stay or leave subconscious decision into
a positive I want to stay emotional experience by following these guidelines below.
Alignment.
Absolutely use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the navigation and site templates. This means that
any changes such as color or menus can be implemented and updated across the whole site in
seconds, without the need to update every page individually.
Use clean lines and boxes with straight or round edges, and group items such as text or images in
small boxes or small blocks on the web page for easy scanning. Use small text headlines for each
blockif appropriateso the eye can easily scan your site pages without getting confused with one
big splash of information, with too many links and options. When a visitor is reading or viewing your
website they are using Foveal Vision, which is the small area you focus on at any one time. So
grouping items as above is perfect for quick scanning of your pages and data assimilation.
Colors.
Use a design and color scheme appropriate to your brand and positioning. If you sell eco friendly
products then you will look at using green colors and if you sell bathroom products, use blues. As a
foundation to these colors use a white backgroundlots of white spaceso your text is clear and
your images are easy to see and have visual impact. Think Googles design philosophy and simplicity.
This contributed to its rapid success as a search engine.
A clean, almost neutral design, with one or two accent colors works very well for most e commerce
websites. Look at Amazon.com and Cruthfield.com for good examples. And remember: people are
there to buy your products, not admire your fancy graphics, so let your products do the work.
Use Your Color Choices Wisely:
Blue
Blue is often associated with depth and stability. It automatically evokes emotions of
trust, security, intelligence, peace, and loyalty in people. Blue is the color of the ocean and the
sky and is proven to work well when promoting air and sky products (airlines, air conditioning
units, fans, air filters and water and sea products (cruise vacations, water filters, boats, bottled
water, etc).
On the other hand, avoid blue when promoting food and cooking products. Blue suppresses the
appetite.
69

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Black Power, class, seriousness, drama, sophistication, and boldness (works well for
prestigious products)
White Purity, peace, cleanliness, freshness (works well for medical products and weight loss
products)
Purple Sophistication, royalty, mystery, spirituality (works well for yoga products)
Green Freshness, safety, growth, vitality, calmness, prestige (works well for drugs, health and
wellbeing, medical products, natural products and eco friendly products use darker green for
financial or make money products)
Orange is used to evoke enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination,
attraction, success (works well for toys and puzzles.)
Red is often associated with passion, desire, war, danger, strength, power, and love (red works
well in the dating and seduction niches, and it also works well with products such as energy
drinks, automobiles, and items related to sports and action)
Yellow is an attention getter, which is the reason taxis are painted this color. When over used,
yellow can have a disturbing effect. Tests show that babies cry more in yellow rooms. Yellow is
seen before other colors when placed against black, which is why this combination is often used
to issue warnings.
Men tend to see yellow as a lighthearted, 'childish' color, so it is not recommended to use yellow
when selling prestigious, expensive products to men. This explains why you very rarely see Yellow
in high end watch advertisements, or advertisements for expensive cars.
Buttons & Internal Links.
Websites and the web itself is just one big network of links. All pages on a website are connected by
button, graphic or text links. So think carefully about the shape, color and wording on your button
links, as different emotional responses are evoked. Test this using Google Analytics and Split
Testingdetailed in Element 15 and Step 4to see if visitors actually click them or ignore them. If
you use graphic links, accompany these with a text link where possible. For optimum SEO use
keywords or key phrasesagain where possiblein the internal link (anchor text) on your website.
Graphics & Images.
For that initial hook, use stunning and professional images and graphics where possible. Your
website graphics will blend nicely with your website design and text. Do not use too many graphics
and again let your product descriptions do the selling once the visuals have evoked an emotional
response.
Speak with your product suppliers to get good product images, as they may have already had these
created by professionals for brochures, etc. Images can graphically paint the emotional result that
your product gives to your prospect, and really entice them to feel the experience they will get by
owning your product.
70

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Also use Alt Text on your images, so if the image does not loador is slow to loadyour visitor
knows what is supposed to be there in the blank space. You can set up your e commerce system to
automatically extract the alt text information, from your product Name Field and display this with
each imagefor ultimate automation.
Image Type.
Homepage Images: Do not use too many images here, just enough to get your prospect
hooked and into your deeper category and product pages. If you have a lot of contentfor
SEO purposesthen more images may be required to balance out the copy.
Thumbnails: these are the smaller preview type images and are good to use on the product
category pages, detailing the products in this particular categoryor naturally the
thumbnail page, if you are using a thumbnail page. Also used on the product page as
related images, so when you click or hover on these, they appear bigger in place of the main
image or in a new window.
Main Product Image: Use the highest quality image you can find (while still displaying
correctly in customers browsers), as this is crucial for evoking positive I want this product
now emotions and experiences in your prospects mind that initiates an immediate buying
response.
View Larger Image: Great so your prospect can see your product in closer detail. Typically
opens in a new or pop up window. Its essential to have a clearly worded Close or Close
Box link in this window, so your visitor can click it and close the window, and get back to
buying your product.
Magnify (Zoom) Image: Allows your site visitor to zoom in on any area of the productideal
for clothing. Only use a good and fully tested magnify/zoom moduleas many you see on
websites are often flakeyand only add more resistance when they fail to work properly.
Logo & Branding.
Use a professional and easy to read logo, with pertinent colors and font styles for your business
positioning. Look at the elite and successful companies in the world and you will see how clean and
simple their logos are; such as Amazon, Dell or Walmart. Place your logo, top left of your website in
the header, and think about a short tagline underneath using keyword rich text so Google can read
and index it for SEO purposes.
Load Speed & Headlines.
If your web developer can do this, load the center of your website first where your headline and
intro text sits. This center area is the Center Container, and it loads faster than the main site
template (Header, Footer, and Side Columns). By loading your center container and text headline
first, it will capture your visitors attention, especially if its benefit oriented as in the following
example:
71

www.ecommercegetitright.com
iPods, MP3 Players & MP3 Accessories all at Exclusive Prices and Delivered to Your Door FREE, in 1 3
Working Days.
This makes your website sticky and encourages visitors to want to stay on your website especially if
your images are slow to load, and/or if your visitors internet connection is slow. Images and
graphicssuch as your header and footercan sometimes take up to 30 seconds to load, and if they
are set to load first, but dont, then your customer has no benefit to hold them and may leave.
People are trained to read bigger, bolder words... so make your headlines bigger and bolder. Make
them red, if and where feasible, so they stand out from the rest of your text.
Give your sub headlines and paragraph titles a bit more emphasis than your regular body copy. And
use plenty of white space, so your page doesn't look crowded. For headlines and sub headlines, try
fonts like Impact, Tahoma Bold, and Helvetica Bold.
Keep it simple, and create a consistent and familiar hierarchy with your
content; headlines, sub headlines & descriptions on all pages.
Description Text & Fonts.
Write descriptions that are interesting, informative and loaded with benefits. There is a debate with
e commerce websites where gurus say its wrong to use long descriptions. In my experience, this
belief is wrong. If your products and customers require a lot of detail, then use long copy split into
sub headlines and tables. This is great for SEO!
Use clear text on navigation buttons and on product menu lists, with a capital letter at the start of
the word, and lowercase thereafter. I would definitely not use all CAPS in product menus too often,
as CAPS ARE HARDER TO READ than a Capital Letter Plus Lowercase. Nor would I recommend using
just lowercase throughout the buttons and linksunless that is your theme and it fits.
Easy to Scan.
Layout your text descriptions so your pages can be scanned quickly, from top to bottom. The use of
a main headline, sub headlines and splitting areas of your content into headers or tables with
headers such as Description, Features/Spec and Technical, going down the page, allows for quick
scanning.
Use a clean font style appropriate to your website, product, category and theme that is easy to read
and use the appropriate font size for your user. If you are selling to an older age group, think about
using a larger font or even explicitly give the option to view with larger fontas not many people
know how to increase the font size in their browser.
72

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Basic Button example of how to offer different Font Sizes on your website
Fonts.
Try Sans Serif fonts for your headlines and sub headlines, and Serif fonts for your regular in line
body copy. Sans Serif fonts are clean and straight fonts without those little extras on the tops and
bottoms of the letters. Serif fonts have the extra little embellishments.
For your regular in line body copy, use Serif fonts. Serif fonts have been used in print for years
(Magazines, Newspapers, Books) and have been proven to create higher readability. This includes
fonts like Courier New, Georgia, and Times New Roman.
F Pattern.
Eye tracking research suggests people read websites differently than books and magazinesthat is,
top to bottom and left to right. Instead they read a web page in an F Shaped pattern which is in
horizontal sections, and read less and less of each line as they read down the left side. So position
your important site elements, such as product menus and site navigations at the top and on the left
hand side.
Marketing & Promotional Elements.
Use these to promote your special offers, best sellers, email newsletter opt in, technical info, trade
info, security info, etc. You can position them on the main navigation bars as regular links, in the
center container on the homepage or footer as on page graphical elements, or as commonly seen in
the left and right hand columns below the product menus.
Keep this information small in height, position it in square or round edge boxes, and use clean colors
that are subtle and not too overpowering. Let your main site navigation and features control the
website sales funnel, and allow your marketing areas and boxes balance with the site design and be
available if your site user needs them.
73

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Main Website Table Position in Browser.
Do you position your website in the center of the page (on the screen)? To the left of the page? or
do you consume the whole browser window like Amazon.com does as an example? This really is
personal preference and there is no right or wrong table positioning.
Consider these Points for Your Site Table Positioning:
1) Consider the screen resolution size used by your customers, so it balances well on screen.
2) The amount of products your website sells and the number of services you are promoting. If
these two are massive like an Amazon.com, then utilizing the full screen is recommended, so
you have enough room to promote everything. On the flip side, if its cluttered then it can be
very detrimental to usability and conversions.
3) Length of menus and marketing / promotional boxes that you need to display in the left and
right side columns such as opt in box, security and cards, ordering, best sellers, trade service,
or whatever it may be for your particular site and the services offered.
4) Your target visitor and size of font and content required. People with impaired vision may
need the font larger with less clutter.
5) Carrying on from (4), do you need to focus the website on a narrower width to give the eye a
cleaner and simpler area to view?
6) People read from left to right, so for a more traditional audience, a left aligned table layout
may be more appropriate.
Attention to Detail.
Be detailed and specific, clean up typos and grammar. One spelling mistake can give the impression
that you do not check things. If you cannot spell, or cannot be bothered to check your spelling, a
customer will doubt that you can handle their credit card and personal details responsibly. These are
subconscious thoughts and references that customers make.
74

www.ecommercegetitright.com
3) Usability.
A clean, clear and simple navigation layout, with multiple navigation and product search options is
the way to optimize usabilityand consequently maximize sales.
Know your Customer.
If you do not know who your customer is, find out
and quick! Well discuss this in more detail
shortly, but in order to maximize sales and conversions you need build your website specifically for
your target customer.
Demographics & Psychographics.
This is simply about communicating to your audience effectively. Every personality type, every age
group (within reason), every intelligence level and every internet experience level can land on your
website. Have you considered building your website for the visually impaired, so they can easily
navigate? How about providing how to guides and help videos, to educate your users? These are
just two simple examples to get you thinking.
Multiple Languages.
Offering multiple languages and selling globally can on average add 25% to your sales. This obviously
depends on the product you are selling, and its suitability to be shipped overseas. However, having a
global reach gives you and your customers a win win situation.
Ask your web developer if they have a stable and reliable multi Language module, and can you see it
in action on a live site. Many branded e commerce software solutions now come with this option.
When testing on a live website, look for any text overflow in box headers, etc, as words can be
longer when converted into other languages.
Googles Free Website Translate Tool.
Google offer a Website Translator module that can be integrated into your site in minutes, by way of
a simple piece of code. This will add a simple drop down menu to your site, in your chosen location,
and will provide your site users with approximately 50 different language conversions.
Note: Any text overflow present, when your default language is converted, is something you may
just have to accept. So weigh up any negative effect of this text overflow versus the simplicity of
using this module, and the extra sales you could get as a result of selling globally.

Trade Accounts.
By way of a simple trade application form on your websitesimilar to a contact form but with
company detailsyou can offer trade customers a discount on products. Trade customers complete
the form and their details are then stored in the e commerce trade module, in your Content
Management System (CMS) back end, awaiting your approval. Its all managed there.
Contact Forms.
As discussed in Step 1 (Sales & Support), using a clean and simple contact form is essential, so that
would be customers can reach you easily. I prefer contact forms to displaying an actual email
address on the live site, because spammers can get hold of your email address. If you add a
CAPTCHA challenge response (security code) onto your contact form, any spam attempts are
blocked.
Example of a CAPTCHA Enabled Contact Form
Search Box.
All good e commerce websites must have a search box option, as this is one of the first features a
user will look for when entering your site and searching for products. More often than not,
prospects will have arrived at your site direct from the Google search engine where they will have
used the search box feature. So give them consistency and offer a search box.
76

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Note: Test your search feature for accuracy of search results, before making your website live. If you
give poor search results to your visitorsas many low end e commerce solutions doyou will deny
your prospects and customers access to your product offerings and frustrate your site users.
See Googles Commerce Search for ideas: www.google.com/commercesearch/
3 Example Search Boxes
Easy Navigation & Product Menus.
Finding products easily is down to using a clear hierarchy of product tiers, using text links or buttons
to navigate from the home page down to the product pages. This clear structure is critical so your
site user knows where to click to find the products they want. Use clean and uncluttered product
menus and navigation bars. If you have a long product menu, split this into groups with a small
heading per group so that its not one longhard to readmenu.
Give Various navigation options so Customers can Easily Find Your products:
Use a simple search box that scans your site content for matching keywords
The header navigation bar can have a Shop link/button linking to a page with all your
product categories listed all on the one page
Alternatively use a header navigation bar with a drop down menu displaying each main
category or subcategory
A left hand product menu can detail each product category or subcategory, using text or
graphic headers for each and as in the paragraph above following a linear path to the
products
Taking navigation to its optimum level, a filter module giving the savvier net user a way to
drill down through product attributes, to find specific products in seconds
Thumbnail page (category or subcategory) will have sort features to filter by type, price,
date, amount, or alphabetical order, and the ability to ascend & descend these options and a
View Items Per Page
Product promotions on your home page or left or right hand columns  for example Top 10
Best Sellers, New Arrivals, etc.
You can position Best Sellers and New Arrivals in your main site header navigation bar for
optimal prominence
77

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Footer Links provide quick access to specific categories or direct to specific best selling
products (this is a good strategy for SEO too)
Link to your products from your Blog, How to Guides, Videos, etc.
In the example below, you will see that the silver menu in the center is made up of collapsible lists.
When you click one of the main bold categories a list drops down to reveal the products within.
4 Examples of Easy to Read and Use Product Menus
Hot Tip: A clear and simple tiered navigation, with the least steps as possible, not only
helps your user, but also allows Google spiders to crawl and index your website with ease.
Text links are better for Google than image buttons, and if you do have to use image
buttons, accompany these with a text link or use your left menu as text links. Alternatively
add an additional footer solely for these text links, to pass the Google goodness down to
your categories and product pages. This is essential for good on site SEO.
78

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Highlight Categories.
When a site user is in a specific category on the website, highlight this on the navigation bar so they
know exactly where they are on the website at any moment. This can be by way of a different shade
of button or an underlined or bold font. Alternatively, use detailed header text to show in what
category they are currently located.
Breadcrumbs or Breadcrumb Trail.
The small horizontal links positioned at the top of product pagesdirectly below the header
navigation bargive users a way of keeping track of the path they have taken, and show them their
current location within your e commerce site. The term comes from the trail of breadcrumbs left by
Hansel and Gretel in the fairy tale; as they go deep into the forest, they drop breadcrumbs to help
them find their way out.
Breadcrumbs are very useful on deeper e commerce websites that have lots of categories, products
and pages. It is your decision if you want to use them. Some websites do, some do not. They can be
used for navigational purposes, and/or as an advanced SEO strategy.
Most sites use these poorly. This means that a large percentage e commerce shoppers do not know
what they are, or what they do. If you are using these for user navigation then do exactly that,
showing people their current location on your website. It is important to highlight that the
breadcrumbs are navigational links and can be clickedinstead of having these small but very useful
links camouflaged.
Id even recommend highlighting the breadcrumb link of the area of the site they are currently in,
like this below highlighting the Product:
You Are Here: Home > Category > Product
The breadcrumbs in the images below are all located at the top of the website product and category
pages, directly below the main site header. The iHerb.com example (bottom of the 3 breadcrumb
images below) highlights your location in green.
3 Example Product Breadcrumbs from Various Successful Websites
79

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Checkout Breadcrumbs:
Using a breadcrumb trail in your checkout process is highly recommended even if you opt not to use
one for your product hierarchy. This is detailed more in section 5 entitled Checkout, further down.
The top two breadcrumb images below are positioned at the top of the checkout page. The bottom
2 images are both used on the same checkout pages. The text in bold, You are Here, sits at the top
of the checkout pages and under the site main header; the small round icons sit at the bottom of
the checkout pages. You can be flexible and also use one or the other, either at the top or the bottom
of the page.
4 Example Checkout Breadcrumbs from Various Successful Websites
Sales Funnel  Guide Your Visitors.
If you want people to buy your products, take them by the hand from entry (entering your site), to
exit (ordering a product): either explicitly tell them exactly what to do within each step, or make it
so obvious and self explanatory that nobody could miss it. This is your sales funnel. Good e
commerce websites have them. If a customer lands on your home page, then subtly guide them to
your category page as fast as possible, then into your product page, and then into your checkout
with as few steps and as little resistance as possible.
Website Product Hierarchy.
E commerce websites follow a hierarchy or tier structure, like a tree with branches. However, if you
go deeper than three clicksfrom the home page before you get to a product page, you will lose
visitors and Google will struggle to find your products for ranking and SEO purposes. To get it right,
there are typically two popular product hierarchies used on e commerce websites.
80

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Recommended E commerce Website Tier Hierarchies:
1) 3 Tiers: 1. Home Page > 2. Category Page (or thumbnail view page) > 3. Product Page
2) 4 Tiers: 1. Home Page > 2. Category Page > 3. Subcategory Page (or thumbnail view page) >
4. Product Page
3 Tier Product Hierarchy.
If you have a DVD website for example, you would structure it like this.
Tier 1
Home Page: The Home Page is the top tier and displays your products by category on the
product menu links. When a customer clicks a product menu category (such as Comedy, Drama,
Sport, etc.), they enter into the Category Page (also known as a thumbnail page).
Tier 2
Category Page: All products within this specific category will normally be laid out on the
page using a thumbnail view. This is like a preview of all of the products in this one category page
using a small thumbnail image per product, maybe a small intro description, possibly price and
customer review rating and a view more or learn more (or similar) button. When you click the
thumbnail products link or image, you enter into the main product page for that particular product.
Tier 3  Product Page: This is the product page where the customers will add product to cart
before entering the checkout. You will display main product images, description, price, add to
cart/basket button, etc. on this page. See Element 7 for Product Page information.
4 Tier Hierarchy.
If you have a clothing website, you could structure it like this.
Tier 1
Home Page: The Home Page is the top tier and displays the products by main category on
the product menu links. When a customer clicks a product menu category (such Men, Women,
Children, etc.), they enter into the Category Page.
Tier 2
Category Page:
Here the categories will display sub categories from within the main
categories such as (Mens: T shirts, Shirts, Knitwear, etc). When a prospect then clicks a product link
such as T shirts, they enter the Sub Category page (also known as thumbnail page).
Tier 3  Sub Category Page: All products within this specific category will normally be laid out on the
page using a thumbnail view. This is like a preview of all of the products in this one category using
small thumbnail images, maybe a small intro description, possibly price and customer review rating
and a view more or learn more (or similar) button. When you click the thumbnail products link or
image, you enter into the main product page.
Tier 4  Product Page: This is the product page where the customers will add product to cart
before entering the checkout. You will display main product images, description, price, add to
cart/basket button, etc on this page. See Element 7 in the following pages for Product Page
information.

Sort Feature.
It is critical within the sales funnel process to offer usability options to your prospects and existing
customers, but you must make it seamless. Category (Thumbnail pages) must provide various sort
filtering options that could include:
Sort by Type
Sort by Price
Sort By Color, Brand or other specific
Sort by Date Newest added to Site
Sort by Best Selling
Sort by Amount in Alphabetical Order
Ability to Ascend & Descend all of these options
View Quantity of Items Per Page
Sort By: Type, Price, Date, Amount, Alphabetical Order: this enables customers to quickly find the
product they wantthen you can get them into the product page so they can place an order.

Two Popular Shopping Cart Processes.
When customers Add to Cart, there are two common methods used by e commerce websites. It is
important to test each before selecting a model to follow. Well discuss more on this testing (Split
Testing) in Step 4.
Standard Cart Process: When a customer adds a product that they want to buy to their cart, they
are automatically taken to the Shopping Cart page (as the image below shows). From here they can
click Continue Shopping that will take them either back to the product page they have come from
or to the home page (this simply depends on how you set the site up). Alternatively, your customer
can click the Checkout button and place the order on the Cart/Basket page.
Traditional & Standard Shopping Cart/Basket Page
84

www.ecommercegetitright.com
New Cart Process: When your prospect adds product to cart they stay on the product page. They
are then presented with a confirmation (pop up) displaying the cart activity. They are not
automatically taken to the cart page as in the Standard Cart Process. The cart page still exists, but
you only go there if you click the View Cart or Basket link.

4) Conversion.
Usability and Conversion go hand in hand. Without great usability your website conversion rate will
suck. Conversion is the process of converting a prospect into a customer. A conversion equals a sale.
When you first launch your website, it will not be firing on all cylinders. There is no way youll get it
converting at the optimum visitor to sales conversion rate from the outset, until you analyze user
data
and this can only be carried out once you actually have enough traffic to gather usable data.
Only when you consistently get at least 50100 people a day on our website will you have enough
metrics to judge and get actual results. The more visitors per day, the more accurate the data will
be.
However working on a website that is growing and not yet at its peak is not a problem. If you recall
the You Dont Have To Get It Right, you Just Have to Get it going quote from earlier in the book,
then youll realize there will always be room for improvement, and increases in your conversion rate.
Analyzing user data is detailed in Element 15) Analytics & Reports.
Use these critical conversion tips on your website today and
immediately boost profits or use when you have enough user data!
Marketing Costs vs. Conversion Increases.
Should you be spending money on marketing if your conversion rate is poor? You can and should,
but then at least pause when you get enough data to analyze and refine, as mentioned above. In
Step 1 (Traffic>Conversion>Relationships), we touched on the results attainable if you continue to
refine your website over its life cycle. This can increase conversion rates from 1% to 4% overnight.
Moreover, by doing so, if you sell one product per day at $100, then overnight after making subtle
design and navigational changes you could be taking $400 without spending another cent on
marketing.
E commerce websites characteristically have two main resistance points. This ultimately means
visitors to your website will stay and buy your products, or they will leave faster than they arrived.
Resistance Point 1: The moment a prospect enters your website.
As you approximately have 57 seconds to capture your visitors attention, you need to get them
interested in what you have to offer and make them stick to your website. They will either click to
another page, buy your product or leave. If they leave on the page they enter on, this affects your
visitor to sales conversion rate and bounce rate. Resistance Point One can come from any design or
layout element: poor colors, images, text (headlines & descriptions), buttons (shape, color, and text),
badly worded links, poor navigation, a design thats too busy, price, etc. Remember, this is primarily
a subconscious decision.
86

www.ecommercegetitright.com
The average conversion rate on an e commerce website is less than 1%. Less than one in every one
hundred visitors to the average e commerce site will leave without buying a product. Bounce Rate
as we will discuss later in element 14) Analytics section is the percentage of people that enter your
website on a specific page, and leave from the same page without clicking to another page they
see only a single page before leaving.
Resistance Point 2: Any Step of Your Website Checkout Process.
A prospect has landed on your website, and they are interested in your products. They add to cart,
and enter your checkout process. This is the next critical zone where prospects tend to bail out!
Average dropped shopping cart percentages (also known as cart abandonment rates) are in the 80%
plus range. This is when a would be customer leaves your cart checkout process and your website
without buying. For every one hundred people entering the checkout process, only twenty or less on
average will complete their order.
For every additional step (or page) you have in your checkout process, you potentially lose more and
more would be customers. We will address this in section 5),  Checkout. There may obviously be
more areas of your website that create resistance to your prospects, but it is of critical importance
to get these two points right.
Usability and converting traffic comes down to Keep it Simple!
87

www.ecommercegetitright.com
5) Checkout.
Continuing from section 4), Conversion, a short and smooth checkout process is crucial for
maximizing orders. As we now know, Cart Abandonment is a huge problem for e commerce
websites. The need to eliminate checkout resistance and consequently reduce cart abandonment
rates is of prime importance, and this alone can mean the difference between an extra $10K and
$100K plus in sales per month.
Reduce Checkout Resistance.
We need a fast checkout process that is seamless with as few as steps as possible and little or no
resistance. It has to be clean and simple with no distractions, so I recommend removing your left
and right menusjust like Amazon doand keep the text to a minimum and make it very succinct
with clear and basic instructions of what you want the customer to do.
Amazon actually go one step further and remove the header navigation too with only a small Go to
the Amazon.com home page (without completing your order) link at the bottom of their final Order
Review page. This is taking their checkout process to the next level; its laser focused but could be
one step too far for a small business e commerce website. Run tests and you will know which is
best.
Display help notifications on small pop upsvisible when a would be customer makes the cursor
hover over an info linkwhere required, assisting your shoppers so the whole checkout process is
seamless and self explanatory. Any detailed how to order guides will go in your help or customer
support area. Your prospects are emotionally charged during a checkout phase and are not thinking
logically, so do not make them think too much or your sale could be lost.
In summary: During the checkout process do not give prospects too many options and definitely do
NOT give them a checkout degree course!
Checkout Breadcrumbs:
Using a breadcrumb trail in your checkout process is important as it shows your prospects exactly
where they are in the checkout process and how many steps are left to order completion. This guide
is by way of links, small image icons or both and can help reduce cart and checkout abandonments.
88

www.ecommercegetitright.com
3 Checkout Breadcrumb Examples
Checkout Page Security Requisites.
Display clear yet subtle security and credit card logos, and maybe a small padlock or security image
in the checkout process. These will build trust and familiarity. You will need a secure checkoutthis
is mandatoryand your web developer or hosting company will provide the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL). See an example verification image below of an SSL enabled website.
Using an SSL will 100% secure your website checkout area and an s will appear in your domain
name (as in https://, instead of just http://) when in the checkout. In addition, an image of a
padlock will appear in your visitors browser.
Note: You should NOT make the whole website secure, as it will slow the load speed down massively
and is unnecessary. Only secure your checkout.
Unsecure and Secure URLs
Example of a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Enabled Website, Displaying SSL Certificate
Coupon/Voucher Code Box.
If you have a Coupon or Discount Voucher Code box in your checkout area, and you are not currently
running discount promotions, then disable it. Customers are fickle and easily distracted. Many will
leave your checkout page and go hunting for money off coupon codesand the problem is that
many would be customers will never return to complete their order.
So (see section 14 Marketing Elements) get your web developer to add the facility to disable this
box from the back end admin, as and when required. If you are not running any coupon code /
money off promotions then turn the box off in the checkout: make it disappear until you need it.
Example Discount Coupon/Voucher Code Box as Found in Checkout

Create Account.
Another potential problem is if you ask people to sign up or create account in your checkout area:
this can greatly increase cart abandonment rates. The majority of people do not like to sign up or
create an account when buying. Therefore, you can subtly word this so that your prospects believe
they are simply entering their billing/shipping details and this eliminates the enemy of resistance.
Your prospect is actually creating an account by giving you their details, but you do not need to
advertise the fact. Larger and more reputable companies such as Amazonhaving more brand
awarenesscan explicitly ask you to create an account with fewer cart dropouts.
An Average Create Account Form This is how NOT to word your Checkout Account Set up Process
Amazon.com Express Checkout.
Amazon.com has recently launched Pay Phrase, a simple way to verify your account to speed up
purchasing. You set up a unique phrase like Web Warrior and select a 4 digit PIN. This is linked to
your Amazon account, which is pre loaded with your credit card and shipping address. Whether it
actually speeds up purchasing though, is another question.
Setting Up Checkout Funnel Goals to Monitor Cart Abandonment.
Many website checkout areas and processes are too complex, time consuming and have up to seven
different pages. If you monitor your website statsby setting up Goals in Googles free Analytics
softwareyou will see where people drop out and at which step in the checkout process.

www.ecommercegetitright.com
What Creates Checkout Resistance?
Slow loading speed
Too many steps, too many pages, too many options, too many distractions
Too confusing or too busy
Using the words Create Account can be a problem depending on product and customer
type.
Broken forms or fields (needs testing in different browsers and platforms such as IE, Firefox,
Safari, Windows & Apple Mac)
Discount Code Box Can entice potential customers to leave the site to look for discount
codes
Not secure (lack of SSL certificate, no s in the https in URL/Web Address & no padlock
symbol in browser)
Poor trust due to no visible security logos or accreditations such as MasterCard, Visa, PayPal,
Bank Logos, Shopping Safe accreditations like BBB (US), McAfee Secure or FSB & ISIS in the
UK
Button color, shape & wording
Cart & Checkout Buttons.
The color, shape and wording used on buttons can play a huge part in conversion rates. Imagine a
big square edged button, saying BUY NOW in a bright red color. Contrast this with a round edged
button, in blue saying Add to Cart. In testing, you will find different emotional responses evoked
between the two buttons, affecting sales. This is not only about button characteristics but also
depends on your product and positioning, so use appropriate button elements. Not only in your
product, cart and checkout pages, but site wide as well, consider your button shape, color and
wording.
Random Cart & Checkout buttons. What Emotions do These Evoke in You?

Stop checkout resistance and massively reduce shopping cart/basket
abandonment rates Revolutionary 1 page checkout can Increase sales
& profits by up to 400% overnight!
The 1Page Checkout Model.
In 2005 my team and I spent a lot of time analyzing the checkout process on my websites,
monitoring the cart abandonment rates and testing various checkout set ups, using split testing and
multivariate testing. This is the process of using two or more different checkout concepts and
modifying on page elements, randomly showing each one to customers and measuring the results.
You then select the best performing setup, modify further until you reach your desired conversion
rate, and then use it permanently on the live site. Incidentally, this can be applied to almost any area
of your website, from buttons to pagesmore on split and multivariate testing in Step 4.
As a result, we designed and built a pioneering 1page checkout. This new and exclusive checkout
page immediately follows the cart /shopping basket page and contains all user forms on the one
page in five simple steps. I have various different layouts on this model and all undergo thorough
testing to ensure they improve conversion rates before permanent use on the live site.
Will this Checkout Format Improve Conversions on all Websites?
The simple answer is that you need to test! Using a 1page checkout is definitely not mandatory, but
testing is. In a perfect scenario, you would run split testing on your normal checkout versus the new
one page checkout and measure the results. Split testing would serve up both checkouts randomly
and you pick the one that converts more sales.
The 1 Page Checkout Form & 5 Simple Step Process for Customer:
1) Step 1: Billing Details
2) Step 2: Shipping Details
3) Step 3: Shipping Option
4) Step 4: Payment Method
5) Step 5: Create Password
6) Order Preview Box with simple overview of the items being paid for
7) Click Confirm Order Button
Note: The text at the side of password in brackets disguises a sign up to account process. It says
something like A password allows you to view your orders, print invoices, and make address
changes, action returns and place future orders faster.
Each step on the checkout page is accompanied by a small Info link, which gives you a small pop up
with information assistance when you hover over it.
Note: For reference, I detailed the Create Password text above as people get suspicious about
creating accounts and passwords as discussed earlier.

Order Confirmation Page.
Once an order has been placed on your website, your customer will be presented with the Order
Confirmation Page (also known as Order Success Page).This mainly says Thanks for your order!
However, this page can be greatly improved and utilized for much more.
When a customer has just ordered they have endorphins rushing around their bodies. This is the
ideal opportunity to offer them something else, as they are highly responsive.
Order Confirmation Page Tips:
Say Thank you to your customer. Explain their invoice will be emailed to them and give
expected shipping times and that multiple items may be delivered at separate times if one is
out of stock
Ask them to check their Spam folder if they fail to receive your email invoice. This will cut
down on support requests.
You can offer a Newsletter Sign Up or RSS
If you have multiple websites, place banners or links to your other websites here
Offer related and recommended products
Place Google Adsense (to make money on the exit click)
Promote other peoples products and services (affiliate links) where available

6) Taking Payments.
Accepting credit and debit cards is mandatory for E commerce websites. This method is fast and
efficient for you and your customers and with the introduction of cash balance credit cards,
practically anyone has access to a credit card to use as payment.
In addition to accepting credit and debit cards, you also have the option to accept payment by
phone, fax, mail and bank transfer, but the majority will pay online or by phone using a credit card.
My recommendation is to accept Credit & Debit cards and Bank Transfer, removing unnecessary
payment options. Keep the process simple and clinical.
My latest data shows approximately 80% of customers order online and 20% order by phone. When
customers pay by phone you can (a) run an order through an online virtual terminalthat your
card payment processing company provides you withor (b) you can just process the order through
the website as customers do. Either way is fully secure.
There are hundreds of companies offering online payments and there are two main models.
1 Payment Service Provider.
Worldpay, PayPal or Google offer a fully integrated payment system. They not only (a) encrypt the
transaction making it 100% secure once the data leaves your website, but also (b) handle and
process the payments.
2 Payment Gateway and Acquiring Bank.
Like the above but using two different companies to handle each of the two processes separately.
Both companies communicate seamlessly to ensure the transaction is encrypted and secure. Some
companies offer both solutions (1 & 2) so please check when you get quotations.
Typical & Simplified Customer Order Process:
Step 1: Customer orders on your website >
Step 2: Payment gateway securely passes transaction details to bank >
Step 3: Bank approves and completes the transaction >
Step 4: You and your customer both get order confirmation on screen and by email.
WorldPay provides an international solution that can be used for the US market, for the UK market,
and so on. Other solutions may be oriented to certain countries in particular, such as Streamline for
the UK. I recommend SagePay as the Payment Gateway and Streamline (RBS) as the acquiring bank
for UK based customers.
Basic fees payable are: setup, transaction fees per sale such as 2% of the transaction value and a
monthly minimum limit. Be wary of any other stealth fees such as refund charges.

Start with these Merchant Account Providers from the hundreds available:
Google Checkout: www.googlecheckout.com
PayPal: www.paypal.com
WorldPay: www.worldpay.com
SagePay: www.sagepay.com
Streamline: www.streamline.com
The 3rd Man: www.the3rdman.co.uk
Hot Tip: When applying for your merchant account you will be asked to forecast your
annual turnover. The higher your turnover generally the lower your transaction fees will
be so dont be too conservative here because if you can save 0.25% to .5% per transaction
this will equate to quite a saving over 12 months. Also negotiate these fees every 6
months as sales grow.
Multiple Currencies.
If you accept orders from other countries consider accepting payments in your customers' currency.
The top 3 online are Dollar, Euro and Pound Sterling. There are 2 ways to do this:
1) Add a currency module to your ecommerce softwarewith currency selection buttons on
your sitethat gives site users the option to click a link that changes all prices on the site in to
their chosen currency. When they order the currency will show as the site default currency
on the payment processors payment page and on their credit card statement (but typically
converted into their own currency).
Example of simple currency button (with currency selection options) to display on a website
2) In addition to the above for on site viewing, you can also accept the payment in their chosen
currency. When a customer orders they will pay in their own currency: this will show on the
payment processors payment page and on their credit card statement. This option is more
expensive and you will need a separate merchant number for each currency that you accept:
so if you accept Dollar, Euro and GBP then this will triple the application costs.

Integration Options for Payment Gateway and Acquiring Bank:
There are essentially 3 ways to integrate this system with your website and each one offers a flexible
solution. The terms I use may change with each Payment Gateway company.
1) Form
Form integration is the quickest way to start processing online payments. It can take as little as 20
minutes to set up and is by far the easiest way to integrate with your payment gateway.
This is good if...
You are unable, or do not wish, to maintain your own secure web servers and have chosen instead
to have them managed by a third party hosting company.
Your website is run from a shared system with the same web server delivering many different web
sites. In these circumstances, an individual company has very limited abilities to install anything
more than simple HTML pages and script files, and cannot normally install items outside their own
user area (especially if this involves components that will affect the entire server).
You do not wish for any sensitive information to be collected or stored on your site. This removes
the need for you to maintain highly secure encrypted databases, obtain digital certificates and invest
in high level PCI DSS compliance.
Comments: This is the more popular and well known option but has limitations. The customer is
taken from your checkout page across to the payment gateway that may be branded as PayPal,
SagePay, etc., with your logo on there too if required. If youve ever bought online and been taken
off the site to process your order and then returned back to the site post order, then you used
Form.
2) Server
Server integration is recommended to merchants who want to run order & transaction reports on
their own servers, but dont want to invest in their own digital certificate or collect credit card
details on their own website.
Database compatibility: Server integration offers you a more advanced database compatibility,
meaning you can store more information about the transaction such as the amount, the products
selected, the shoppers contact details and the result of the authorization supplied by your payment
provider.
Customization: The payment pages are fully customizable. Server integration also comes with in
Frame technology, where your secure payment fields are framed by your branding, meaning your
customer doesnt even move from your URL. This instantly reduces the need for high level PCI DSS
compliance and doesnt compromise your customers shopping experience on your site.
Comments: Ive never processed transactions in my office manually. But if you have a card machine
or terminal in your office this will be the option for you giving you control of the transaction and
refund process.
101

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Note: Server integration is compatible with many shopping carts and e commerce platforms;
however some off the shelf shopping carts can only be used in conjunction with Form integration.
Check with your shopping cart provider.
3) Direct
Direct integration is designed to enable you to take card details on your own secure servers and pass
them across to Sage Pay (for example) for authorization and secure storage in a server to server
session that does not involve redirecting the shopper to your payment providers payment pages.
It is the method by which you pass the data to your payment gateway, not the method by which
you collect it, meaning you have complete control over the look and feel of your payment pages.
Your customer never leaves your site and they do not necessarily know your payment provider is
authorizing the transaction on your behalf. In practice however many vendors choose to tell their
shoppers as a way of reassuring them about card security.
It is ideal for large companies with existing back office payment software, such as a call center that
wants to integrate their payment system and manage the whole of the payment process internally.
Comments: Direct is my preferred option as all transactions appear to happen on your website and
the customer appears to never leave your website alleviating any issues of confusion or risk. Its
slick, seamless, integrated and fast. Plus you can make it look exactly how you want it to look.
Two Order Processing Options:
When choosing a method of accepting credit and debit cards and the processing of these payments,
you essentially have two choices: real time processing and deferred processing.
1) Real Time Order Processing: Means the credit card and all security checks are approved
automatically without your intervention in real time. The main negatives to this method are:
if you subsequently see something suspicious about the order and think that it may be fraud,
you will have to refund the order and lose the initial transaction fee. In the same way, if a
customer rings up and cancels after placing an order, you will again lose the transaction fee.
2) Deferred Order Processing: Means the order is approved as above, but only a shadow
payment for the order value is placed on the customers card, used for the order. The order
details are also sent to your payment admin area, so you as the merchant have a set period
of timeoften 30 daysto accept and process, or decline the order. The positives of this are
that you have time to run your own security checks, or contact the customer with any
questions, such as shipping related queries or if an item is out of stock, etc. This can save you
the transaction fee if you subsequently choose to decline the order.
102

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Fraud Prevention.
Ask your future payment service provider what fraud prevention features and services they offer.
The majority now offer these three Cardholder Not Present (CNP) fraud prevention services as
standard. There is also the possibility to set bespoke fraud Rule Sets. This allows you to tailor your
desired and specific anti fraud measures on your website, giving you optimal flexibility and peace of
mind.
1) AVS: Address Verification System is a method used to verify the identity of the person
claiming to own the credit card who is ordering on your website. It works by matching the
data entered into your website Billing order form with the address on file at the credit card
company.
2) Card Verification Code: Also known as CVV, CV2, CVVC, CVC amongst others, this is the last
3 digit number on the back of the credit or debit card. If a fraudster has the physical stolen
credit card then he or she will have this number also, so other security is required.
3)
3D Secure: Is a technical standard created by Visa (Verified by Visa) and MasterCard
(MasterCard SecureCode) to further secure CNP (Cardholder Not Present) transactions over
the Internet. New customers, who have not yet used the 3D facility on their card, will set up
a password or pass code when they first try to pay on a 3D secure activated website. Then
for subsequent online orders, they will simply provide the password or code chosen on the
3D page. This service is provided to you as a merchant through your payment provider as a
bolt on service for your website (not mandatory) and has pros and cons.
3D Positives: its water tight, unless the fraudster has found out your security pass. Also, be
aware some customers may only buy from a 3D secure website.
3D Negatives: it adds resistance to your checkout process involving an extra step in the
order process that genuine customers must go through. On the other hand, if a fraudster
does get hold of the password of the stolen card he or she is using, this will result in a
spend fest until the card is registered as stolen by the real card owner.
4) Bespoke Rule Sets: I use SagePay as my payment gateway provider in conjunction with
Streamline (RBS) the acquiring bank. SagePay offer an additional fraud screening service
provided by The 3rd Man: this gives you a fraud potential rating for each order, based on
the transaction details. These bespoke Rule Sets give you the ability as a merchant to
determine what extra level of security you feel your website needs. In addition, this
flexibility is very useful, as some product markets will have more fraud attempts than
others. Some countries will also produce more fraud attempts than other countries, Nigeria
being one hot spot for fraud attempts.
*Please check with your payment provider to see if they offer similar anti fraud services.
103

www.ecommercegetitright.com
MasterCard Securecode.
MasterCard SecureCode is a simple and secure way to pay at thousands of online stores. A private
code known only to you and your bank, your SecureCode enhances your existing MasterCard
account by protecting you against unauthorized use of your card when shopping online at
participating online retailers.
MasterCard SecureCode: www.mastercard.com/securecode
Verified by Visa.
Verified by Visa protects consumers by requiring a password during online purchases, helping
ensure no one else can use their Visa card online. Verified by Visa also protects merchants from
fraud related chargebacks on all Visa personal debit and credit card transactions, even when
processing transactions from non participating issuers.
VerifiedByVisa: www.visa.com/verifiedbyvisa
Hot Tip: For UK Customers: If you sign up for an FSB (Federation of Small Business)
account, you are eligible for a discount on Streamline transaction fees. FSB membership
also gives UK based companies insurance, protecting you against tax investigations.

7) Product Pages.
How you present the products is crucial for a successful e commerce website. Look at the big name
e commerce websites such as iHerb.com, Amazon.com, Crutchfield.com, GAP.com, JohnLewis.com,
FatFace.com, etc, for ideas. See how their product information is laid out on the page in ways that
are structured and presented with clarity so you can find items quickly and intuitively.
Elements of a Successful Product Layout Template:
Product name in bold type using product keywords: this generates an H1 tag for SEO  more
on this in 8) below.
Short Description placed underneath the Product Name: this has a H2 tag.
Image to the left of the center container with the ability to View Larger Image, to view
more related images (thumbnails will sit underneath main image), or an option to magnify
any area of main image
Use alt text on images
Add to Cart/Basket box (or cart elements) to right of image: RRP, Your Price, % Saving,
Quantity, ize, Color Options, Warranty, Availability, Add to Cart Button, etc.
Position the product description underneath the main image and Add to Cart box. Separate
with heading from feature list. Utilize supplementary images to enhance the description.
Bulleted feature list positioned underneath the main product description
Any further information below such as technical or related information
Detail any shipping, print this page, warranty, email a friend, social bookmarks,
supplementary but essential info either below the images and above the description or
below the description box (as long as the page is not so long that they get lost)
Attributes.
You will need to decide how many products you will be selling, the way they are laid out on the
page, and what fields, attributes and options you will need per product. Attributes such as size, color
and quantity all need to be factored in and positioned accordingly.
105

Include the basics like web ready and compressed images so they load fast. Use high quality images
for the main image, thumbnails (the small image preview) or additional images, and for the view
larger image option.

Tabbed Layout.
A good option is to have the description, features, and shipping information in tabbed boxes in the
same page location as the main description. This keeps the page short and compact. This just
depends on your SEO aspirations and desired page layout.
See www.fatface.com for an example of this tabbed product layout (image below)
Or checkout www.crutchfield.com who are great at tabbed layouts
Tabbed Product Layout
Product Descriptions.
Use a benefit oriented headline to capture the attention of your visitor when they arrive on your
page. They may get to this page directly from Google. A H2 tag on this headline always helps for
SEO. Use well written descriptions promoting benefits and then list features using bullet points, in
this order. If a customer can say So What? to your description copy then introduce more benefits
and remove features from this section, dropping them into the bullet point feature list below. Add
video where required as this enables the buyer to use more of their five senses to make a positive
buying decision.
Long Copy vs. Short Copy.
There is a debate in marketing circles: do you write short copy or long copy? E commerce and direct
response are two very different animals in my opinion, but you can use direct response elements on
an ecommerce website. However, this has to work in synergy without cheapening the positioning,
and that is the big challenge.
108

www.ecommercegetitright.com
People who succumb to out and out direct response are generally vulnerable and somewhat naive,
which is why some Internet Marketing Gurus and Get Rich Quick businesses make a bundle of
cashbecause they manipulate as opposed to persuadethrough their words targeting gullible
people.
E commerce customers are a different breed in many respects. They will actually be looking for your
products, so the use of direct response needs to be subtle and woven in with your typical
ecommerce layout. Do you recall the key advice earlier in this book Fast, Functional & Familiar?
See this page for a great product layout with lots of keyword rich content:

Product Pages Resource Information.
Its a good idea to display and link to key information your prospects or customers may need to
make a buying decision. Not answering their required questions and your customers could leave
them frustrated. They might then either leave your website or leave your product page looking for
specific answersand never return.
109

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Possible Resource Items or Links to These Items:

Shipping Details (Options, Prices, Delivery Times)
Product Warranties & Money Back Guarantees
Customer Reviews, Product Comparison
Product Resource Box Examples: Providing Key Information & Answering Key Questions on the Product
Page itself (Eliminating need to have to leave the page)
Add to Cart Box.
This box or alternatively these elements positioned around your add to cart button will contain all
the essential information required for your prospect to be comfortable enough to add your products
to their shopping cart. Items required here are: price, attributes, options, quantity, shipping times,
stock availability, brand of product, etc. The best position for this box is to the right of the main
product image, because people read from the left. The Add to cart button (or add to basket in the
UK), will sit underneath the price and other options because people also read from top to bottom.

8) On Site SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
Using super charged SEO modules and White Hat strategies on your e commerce website is your
secret weapon. This builds a solid SEO foundation to get you ranked high in Google in the shortest
space of time, and as a bonus these modules come with the initial website build.
White Hat simply means ethical and in line with Googles recommended practices.
I have had websites attain number 1 ranking in Google with on site SEO only (no off site SEO at all),
and this costs nothing other than a bit of time updating the key SEO tags as you grow. I highly
recommend you get this groundwork right from the outset to give you an SEO advantage now and
into the future.
80% of search engine users use Google. I recommend reading Google Webmaster guidelines to
ensure you keep it legal and so Google loves your website. Many SEO guys are fighting against and
trying to trick Google, but thats simply not required.
Google Webmaster Guidelines: www.google.com/support/webmasters/
Ask your Web Developer to Give You These Features and Options as a Minimum:
Meta Page Titles with data extraction and population from the name field in each product
(also manually editable)
Meta Description
Meta Keywords
H1 Tags automatically assigned to Name Field on Product Page
H2 Tags automatically assigned to Short Description Field on Product Page
H1 Tags automatically assigned to Info page Header Title
H2 tags automatically assigned to Product Headline
Load text first in the center container
Make your website header smaller in height than the norm so that more text can fit on the
page and above the fold (on the screen before you have to scroll to see the full page)

SEO On Page Factors Overview:
Page Title.
This is the bar at the top of your browser window when youre on a website. Its also the first thing
Google reads on your page when indexing it. A good page title is critical in order to rank well in
Google. All things being equal, the page/website with the best page title ranks the highest. You have
approx 6268 characters to use in your page titles. Consult with Google for its latest page title
character count. It is very important to point out that each page title on your website has to be
unique.
Page Title Example 1: Cure My Anxiety | Anxiety Help | Reduce Stress Now
Page Title Example 2: Welcome to Cure My Anxiety  Learn to Reduce Stress Now
Note: Stop words (and, the, in, etc.) are not read by Google in the page title, so limit these.
As your page title is displayed in the Google search results, it has to be engineered for Google and
captivating for Google searchersyour prospectsto get them to click the link and enter your
website.
Two Examples of Page Titles:
Page Title and the Listing You See in the Google Search Results when Searching for a Keyword
From the Same Website, but Showing the Page Title at Top of Browser
Meta Description.
Not actually visible on your website, but hidden in the code and is used by Google to determine the
content of each page on your site. Google lists this below your page title in the Google search results
so make it read well. Optimum is approximately 1416 words or 160 characters. See example of a
Meta Description text in the top image just above. This sits below the blue Page Title link.
Meta Keywords.
My recommendation is to use 56 keywords per page in this box as your competitors can steal your
keywords if you give away too many. Google doesnt currently use this tag but the other engines do.
114

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Header Tags.
Known as H1, H2, H3, etc, these tags are used to help the search engines see the important
headings on your page. Only H1 and H2 really have any value now so you need to use these as bold
headings in your copy, as in menu headings, menu category headings, on page headings. Use only
one H1 tag as your page headline or heading (on each page of your site). Use H2 tags on your other
headings.
Image Alt text.
When you hover on an image on a website, youll often see a piece of text appear; this is Alternative
Text or Alt Text for short. Not used so much by Google now but is very useful information to visitors
to your webpage, if an image does not load in certain browsers. Essential for site users with visual
impairment.
PageRank.
PageRank is one of the methods Google uses to determine a page's relevance or importance, in
addition to Link Popularity and Link Reputation. Incidentally, Google ranks pages and not websites,
so each page on your website is ranked on its own merits.
PageRank essentially does two things:
1) Indicates whether Google considers you to be an authority website
2) Indicates how often Google will send its spiders/bots to index your site pages. The higher the
PageRank, the more often your site is indexed.
When building a website it is essential to build the structure of the site, so PageRank can flow
around easily without resistance, and get down to the deepest product pages, and then link back up
to the home page. Using No Follow tags can distribute PageRank effectively around your site.
Duplicate Content.
Google does not like duplicate content and will not rank duplicate pages found on the same website.
Each URL and page title has to be unique. It is fine if you happen to sell the same product but from
different manufacturessuch as an iPod Car Kit for all manufactures A to Z (Alfa Romeo to
Volkswagen)you just need a unique URL, Page Title, Headline (H1) and (H2s) by replacing the
manufacture keyword site wide. Remember alsodo not plagiarize content from other websites,
period!
115

9) Content Management System & Automation.
Content Management System (CMS).
This is the engine of an e commerce website. Its the back end administration that has been
organized and structured for you the retailer to add products, process orders, etc. and to display
content and products in an organized fashion on the website, for the user to then interactively
purchase products, etc.
It is critical to look at the back end CMS of your proposed website before you hand over any money.
Take it for a test drive demo and see if its easy to use, easy to understand, if it has a clean and
organized user interface, a good user manual, etc.
Flexibility & Speed.
E commerce Content Management Systems need to be flexible and fast for product amendments
and updates. Basic DIY CMSs use a desktop based system where product updates have to be
completed on your local desktop PC and then uploaded each and every time, even if you make a
small text change. Alternatively and highly recommended are CSV based CMS solutions where
product changes are actioned by downloading and uploading a simple CSV that contains your
product catalogue. This offers speed and flexibility, and in particular importing many products at the
same time can then be a snap!
Hot Tip: After making changes get into a habit of checking the live website to ensure
everything looks correct and is displayed as you intended without errors.
A good, robust Content Management System (CMS) will have the following features
and functions from an exhaustive list:
Server based with CSV
Manage and structure the product layout, with clear category tiers and hierarchy
Control prices, shipping, and product features
Manage related products such as cross sells and up sells
Manage stock and synchronize with back end systems
Fully automate on site SEO process in addition to manual editing
Manage orders and payments and customer information
Give the user control over site attributes for SEO and layout performance
Provide individual user accounts
Automate and communicate order information with customers
Create and manage information pages such as About and Contact
Produce various reports and statistics such as Most Viewed and Most Purchased products
Store and handle customer information data for marketing and analysis
Control and produce discount code vouchers, discount code box visibility, banners, etc.

Automation.
Saves time on many daily tasks that you would otherwise have to complete manually on a daily basis
offering flexibility. Many of the e commerce website owners online are struggling to earn a profit by
handling the laborious and mundane tasks themselves. Look to automate wherever possible.
Synchronization.
Synchronizing processes doubles the effect of automation. This is about linking systems together for
the ultimate in efficiency and productivity. Why waste time with manual and duplicated processes?
Try These to Boost Your Efficiency and Productivity:
Set up template emails for every step of the order processfrom order receipt to tracking
numberso an email is available to send out at the click of a button as and when you
change the Order Status inside of your admin. These emails will personalize and add
credibility by extracting and populating the customers first name automatically from their
order data.
Link your products name fields with your SEO Meta Page Titles, automatically add a H1 tag
to each product name Field and add a H2 tag to your short description field so these 3 are
published on the live website without your intervention. Do the same for information pages.
117

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Link your website orders with your back end accounts system.
Link your stocking system with your live website, giving real time stock updates.
Where available integrate a Live Data Feed Stock Database from your suppliers into your
website
Order Status Email Templates.
In my back end e commerce system, I have 1520 template emails written and personalized for
every e commerce order status step and covering every eventuality. They simply inform the
customer what is happening with their order. When you send them, it updates the status of the
order so all back end users know exactly what the order status is, along with the accompanying
notes box.
These emails have immense power in that they reduce customer support enquiries by up to 70%
allowing your team to get on with the important tasks. Communication is key!
Example Template Emails to Reduce Time and Automate:
Order Invoice with Thanks For Your Order message (emailed automatically after a sale)
Order Shipped or Dispatched
Product Out of Stock
Potential Fraud (asking customer to respond within 7 days)
Customer Loyalty Discount Code (sent automatically after invoice email)
Product Review Request (sent automatically 1020 days after order)
Customer Survey
Order Refunded
Trade Account Application, Approval, Decline
Example image (below) of Individual Order in E commerce Back End Admin Area
with Template Emails Linked to Order Status:
You will see below an individual order. The drop down menu shows the Order Status template
emails, mentioned above. When you select an order status from the drop down list, you can choose
to send the template emailattached to each statusto your customer or not. You can also see the
order status history in the colored text, so you know exactly where each order is in the shipping
process. There is an admin box for internal comments.
The red buttons you see below are linked to dispatch email templates and include shipping details
and tracking numbers. When you dispatch an order you click the appropriate shipping company (red
button) and enter the customers tracking number, click Send and it fires out a template email,
confirming the order has been shipped.

10) Key E commerce Features.
E commerce software solutions are NOT all created equal. Look online, find websites you like, and

11) Operations & Order Management.
A busy and successful e commerce website will handle 10005000 orders plus per month, so the
management of this is crucial to save time and keep costs down. Everything from payments to
shipping and returns needs to be managed easily and effortlessly, so that customers get their orders
on time every time, while being updated at every step via your email communication.
Everything is controlled, handled, monitored and processed from the back end CMS admin area.
This is literally the engine room of a website. The best suited software for you is one that can be
synchronized with your existing systems, giving you optimal automation, efficiency and productivity.
The Main Tasks of Operations:
Order stock, pricing, product management
Take orders online and by phone (if you accept phone orders)
Handle payments, order amendments and refunds
Make decisions on suspected fraudulent orders
Process & ship orders
Speak with customers about order security issues such as potential fraud
Speak with customer about any shipping requirements (for example if sending frozen goods
you need to ensure the customer is available to sign for delivery)
Submit claims to your shipping company for any lost orders
Provide customer support and technical support (if required)
Process returns
Handling Suspected Fraud.
This is in addition to having the necessary fraud prevention measures in place as suggested in 6)
(Payment), including 3 D Secure, MasterCard SecureCode and Verified By Visa. You can also take the
following steps with any orders you feel are potential fraud:
1) Log in to your e commerce admin and send your template fraud email that you have pre
written. This is located in your Order Status menu. When you send the email, the status of
this specific order will then become Potential Fraud until you get a response. The email
itself will detail there is a minor issue with the order and you need the customer to call you
to discuss within X Days.
2) If you have no response within your requested timescale then either delete the order or do
what we do and call the customer to see if the order and payment are genuine or not. You
will intuitively pick up clues from the conversation. Most fraudulent buyers will give incorrect
phone numbers, incorrect email addresses, etc. and they very rarely answer the phone when
you call them. Go with your gut response on these orders.
121

www.ecommercegetitright.com
12) Information Pages.
These key information pages and how to guides are important to support your e commerce product
pages, reinforce your terms and conditions, offer trust and ultimately add to the sales potential by
providing help and assistance. As discussed in the products section, it is good to give some of this
information on the actual product page, as an information resource box or links. The more
information your prospect already has, and the fewer distractions, when they are ready to order, the
more chance you have of converting the sale.
These pages can help and assist new visitors entering your website with any concerns or answer
questions prior to viewing your product pages. In the checkout area of the website these pages are
not required, but small info links with a small pop up on hover will help with any usability issues.
I like to include the information and technical pages in one area to keep it compact and together,
highly focused and easy to access via a Help, Customer Support or Customer Service link.
Information Pages Could Include:
About
Contact
Shipping (Delivery)
Security
Ordering & Payment
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
Privacy Policy
Customer Comments (Testimonials)
Newsletter Sign up
Technical Guides

Example of Clear & Simple Support/Info Page Layout
Hot Tip: Keep your Information Pages short and simple. Get to the point quickly and give
the reader exactly what they are looking for. Use Amazon and other good websites as
examples. Most of the pages won't be used for SEO so the use of keywords is not essential.
Here is an (old site) of mine I wrote the info Page copy for 2008:

13) Security, Trust & Testimonials.
Many internet users and especially new users are concerned about disclosing their credit card and
personal information to a website and have doubts as to whether you will actually fulfill their order.
This can be for a number of reasons, including the media reinforcing this with its reports about ID
theft. In addition, they may have personally experienced bad service provided by other websites
and offline businesses. Inept service is very common online.
To counteract these concerns and build immediate trust you have to make them feel comfortable
and safe on your website. Offer various ways to contact you (phone, email, live chat), display and
offer money back guarantees, trust logos, accreditations and testimonials, and maybe even case
studies of happy and satisfied customers.
Services Available to Build Trust on Your Website:
Trust Logos and Accreditations (US & Global): BBB.org, Truste.com, McAfeeSecure.com,
Comodo.com, Trustedstores.com, mastercard.com/securecode, visa.com/verifiedbyvisa,

Example Trust Logos & Boxes to Demonstrate Trust
Where to place Trust Logos & Customer Testimonials:
Placing a few in your left or right hand columns of the website and having a complete testimonial
page (see image below) will help reinforce your trust. It will show prospects that other customers
have bought from you and have had a great experience. People like to do what other people have
done and testimonials and case studies reinforce this behavior. These elements are endorsements
and build credibility when utilized well.
125

Example of Full Page Dedicated to Testimonials
Product Reviews.
Having sold a product, then after 1020 days its a great idea to email your customers and ask if they
would be so kind as to leave a product review on the website. You can automate this and email
them the exact product they have purchased with a link and how to information, so they can leave a
product review easily and effortlessly on the actual product page. This works very well.
The benefit is you will get positive comments about your products, therefore enticing prospects to
buy. You will then have product pages that are busy with lots of activity and fresh new content for
SEO purposes, as Google loves a site with ever changing content.

Review User Interface.
On the image below, you will see that iHerb.com have a simple, yet user friendly interface for
reading and posting reviews. With an interface like this, customers will know where to leave reviews
once they get an automated leave review emailapproximately within 1020 days of receiving
their order from you. This is a great layout to employ on your site.

14) Marketing Elements.
To maximize visitor actions on your websitewhether they order or notyou first need to get them
there. Then you can get them to do what you want them to do, be it place an order, sign up for RSS,
download a free report or opt in to your newsletter.
It is imperative to build a relationship with prospective and existing customers and that you
communicate with them often. Blogs, email newsletters, podcasts, RSS and social bookmarking are
five key communication options you have and this includes video blogs known as vlogs. In addition,
you can even use RSS delivery for the promotion of your products such as Best Sellers and New
Arrivals. Working in synergy, these give you a superior marketing assault.
Blogs.
A Blog also known as weblog is a specific blogging software or module. This is a dedicated area on
your website displaying key information for your site users. You can post blog articles there about
your business, your website features and services you offer. You can talk about products, new
products, special offer products, discount deals, voucher code giveaways, free reports, and
promotional videos just about anything. Just keep the blogs below 400 words, dont bore people,
get to the point, give lots of value and post them often for full SEO effect.
On your navigation bar have a button/link called Blog, News, Latest News or similar.
There is a feature within your blogging software allowing users to comment on your blog posts. This
is something that you can turn on or off based on the desired interactivity that you wish your
website to have. If you activate it, just beware of spam and negative comments.
When you have written and published blogs on your live website, there is a Ping Optionwithin
the back end of your blogthis will inform the blog directories and blog search engines, such as
Technorati.com that a new blog has just been published. This is great for SEO.
I recommend WordPress.com for your blogging software. It has clean code, loads fast, and has a
great user interface and lots of SEO goodies. Any good e commerce developer will have heard of
WordPress and used it.
Blogs are very powerful as an SEO strategy and rank extremely fast and very high in the Google
search results. You can also synchronize your blog with your email newsletter, so that when a blog is
created, newsletter subscribers are emailed alerting them of a new blog post.
www.aweber.com offers a blog/newsletter synchronize feature.
http://wordpress.org/ The home of WordPress blogging software.
128

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Email Newsletters.
You can build a highly responsive email list using high quality email software such as Aweber.com or
an integrated email module built into your e commerce software. Generally this will be split into
two separate list areas; (1) Front End Acquisition (before the sale) and (2) Back End Marketing (after
the sale).
1) The first email list is generated from an opt in subscribe box on your website, be it in the
template of the website (left or right hand column or footer) or on a dedicated newsletter
page. You can use basic Sign up for our newsletter type text or you can push a free report,
free how to guide or specific tips related to your products. Be creative for your specific
website and products.
2) The second is a list of email addresses extracted from customer order information.
Incidentally, when a customer buys from you they legally give you permission to contact
them via email with additional, relevant information, products, promotions or special offers.
See the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 for more information.
Where Possible Synchronize the Two Email Lists.
If you can synchronize the front end and back end email lists, this will reduce customer frustration.
Because once a prospect buys your product and becomes a customer, they will transfer from the
front end list to your back end email list. The ideal scenario is to automate this process.
Its not always feasible to synchronize two different branded software lists so your customer may
just have to Unsubscribe from your front end list instead.
Note: When using these two email list models you should legally displayunder the CAN Spam
Act an Unsubscribe link in the footer of emails you send out. If a recipient is not happy about you
contacting them, they can simply click the link.
Hot Tip: Good email software gives you the opportunity to change email addresses
as well as unsubscribe when you click the Unsubscribe link. This feature is critical, as
you can lose customers who only want to update their email addresses.
Typical User Scenario.
I have all my newsletter subscriptions and order receipts going to different email addresses for
better organization. If companies start emailing my invoice account with newsletters its useless to
me as I wont read them  for the ones that offer an update email address option, I amend it, but
for the others I get highly frustrated and just unsubscribe. Be flexible and give both options.
129

www.ecommercegetitright.com
How Often Should You Email Your Customers?
The best answer I can give is to contact them as often as you can, but always provide information
that is valuable to them; advice, tips or with new or special offer products. However, if you bombard
your customers too often with product offers, this can do more harm than good and your customers
will unsubscribe from your email list.
Amazon manages their email newsletter exceptionally well and offers products related to customers
previous purchases this is a good example of personalization.
Email Personalization.
By personalizing the contact you make with your customer, you not only build a relationship and
trust, you also increase your sales. This means emailing products based on your customers historical
buying data, laser focusing your offerings to them. Additionally it is a good idea to use their first
name in the emails (Dear Steve, Hi Steve, or Hello Mr Smith), but this depends on your positioning.
More below and in Step 4.

www.ecommercegetitright.com
On Site Articles.
These are different to the SEO articles posted on article directories. They are of higher quality and
are for your on site visitors in addition to generating SEO traffic. Buyers guides, how to and
technical articles all written with persuasion to sell your products while optimized will rank well in
Google.
Podcasts.
A podcast is a series of digital media files either audio or video released episodically and
downloaded through web syndication. Depending on what products you sell it may be a good way to
get people on your email list to subscribe and to communicate with the key benefits weekly or
monthly so they eventually buy your products. Podcasts work very well for information services and
products in my experience.
RSS (Real Simple Syndication).
Is a way of delivering a piece of information from your website to your prospects via an
RSS Reader, that displays your content on their PC, Mac, Phone, Tablet, Slate or PDA in an
easy to view way. An RSS feed could be applied to your blogs posts, blog comments, site
content, podcasts, best sellers page, new arrivals page. The concept is that when you add new
content this automatically goes to your RSS subscribers reader, delivering fresh new content in real
time. Fast becoming the favored way of staying in touch due to increasing unreliability of email.
Social Bookmarking.
More and more people regardless of age and income are using Social Bookmarking websites to
communicate with one another, via websites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace. So grab a free
bookmark chicklet button from any of the websites online and display it site wide in your site
template:
Add This Bookmark/Share Chicklets: http://www.addthis.com/web button select
131

www.ecommercegetitright.com
A user on your site simply clicks the iconof the social site they are a member ofto store, tag and
share your site page (link) with their friends or followers. This gives your site users a great way to
stay connected to your companys offerings and to share your products, blogs and information with
family, friends, work colleagues and people with similar interests.
Discount Voucher Codes.
These are also known as coupon codes, retail codes, voucher codes, discount vouchers or even
promotional codes. They are number or letter based codes generated by your e commerce Discount
Code Module in the back end admin area of your website and pre determined by you. For example,
you could have Discount10 that reduces the order value by a set percentage or a set amount such
as or 10% or $10. You can even give free shipping FREESHIPPING for example.
To apply the discount, your customer will enter this code into a small box during the checkout phase
of your website. Then when they click update, the discount will be applied. See the Tip below on
why the option to display this box needs to be flexible.
You can Distribute Discount Codes via:
Blogs, RSS, videos
In your newsletter or even as incentive to opt in to your newsletter
Social media
Display them visibly on your site or in promotional banners
In print marketing
With all new customer orders, for a set percentage or set value amount reduced off
subsequent orders (Back End Marketing via email or in the box)
On the coupon / voucher code websites
Popular Voucher Code Websites:
www.couponcodes4u.com/(US)
www.myretailcodes.com/(US)
www.vouchercodes.co.uk/(UK)
www.myvouchercodes.co.uk/ (UK)
Hot Tip: Get your web designer to put the discount code box (that appears in your
checkout process) on a switch in the admin area. That gives you the option to turn it on
when you run promotions and turn it off when you do not. Heres why this is important: if
you have a visible Coupon Code box in your checkout area, some would be customers will
leave your website and go looking for coupon codes. They may never return! This scenario
just adds to the abandoned cart rate we spoke about earlier.
132

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Website Personalization & Recommendations.
In addition to personalizing your email newsletters, you can greatly increase sales by improving your
users experience with product offerings and recommendations. On the front end (pre sale) you can
add cross sell modules to your website allowing you to link products together, and incentivize
customers to order multiple items per order as opposed to just one. For example, you can link a car
stereo with an installation kit or even installation service.
Amazon links products together such as books with books or cross link products such as CDs with
DVDs. Amazon even offers discounts when you buy the two products it recommends, together. The
heading for this is Frequently Bought Together, offered in addition to Customers Who Bought This
Also Item Bought. This means that on the same product page you will see anything up to five cross
sell/recommendation marketing blocks and features.
You can Call these Blocks or Modules Anything along the Lines of:
You May Also Like / You Might Also Like
You May Also Be Interested In / You Might Also Be Interested In
Your Recommendations / Product Recommendations / Service Recommendations
Customers Also Bought / Customers Who Bought This Also Item Bought
Frequently Bought Together

Recommendation Systems.
When a returning customer is logged into their account on your website, then by analyzing and
using their historical buying data, you can promote and recommend specific products they should
buy. These can be related products, associated products, and accessory products pertaining to their
original purchase and preferences. Use your creativity to offer more products. See Amazon.com for
ideas and read more in Back end Marketing (Step 4).
Areas of the Website that can be Personalized with Recommendations:

Adsense.
I mention Google Adsense in my recommended Google Tools, because its an easy way to make
money on site exits. For example, out of every one hundred visitors to your site on average 99% will
leave without taking your desired action. So having Adsense gives you the opportunity to make
money when people exit your site.
You can position your Adsense block within your products or main site template and give it a title
such as: Customers Also Liked or You May Also Be Interested In, which helps it integrate into your
site. Alternatively, you could position it as Site Sponsors or just have it showing as Google ads.
Adsense is also ideal for putting on the Order Confirmation page or even Contact or Newsletter Opt
in Confirmation pages.

15) Analytics / Reports.
Analyzing website user data and analytics is critical if you want to stay ahead of your product
category and market, beat your competitors in the search engines, and build and target your
website specifically for your users. When you analyze the data on offer on a daily, weekly or monthly
basis, it gives you an up to the moment, birds eye view of what is really happening on your website
and online.
The first time you look at your website stats you will be very surprised and will learn some important
and key lessons. As a result of analyzing and using this data, you can consistently refine your website
to higher profits by:
Targeting top keywords and key phrases
Selling products people actually want
Targeting specific products to specific customers
Making usability changes to your website, content, products and checkout to boost sales
literally overnight
Setting goals and responding to the results
Hiding products that do not sell, but are good traffic generators, in a corner of your website
Do You Know Your Bounce Rate?
Bounce Rate is a measurement that expresses the percentage of site visitors that enter a single page
on your website, and leave without clicking to another page. This is measured in Google Analytics.
Bounce rates are reduced by making your website more sticky as detailed in Design.
Do You Know Who your Visitors are?
This is key information if you are only selling to one country. When you look at your statistics, you
will find that the majority of your site visitors come from other countries. You may be losing 80% of
your traffic because they cannot buy from you!
Are your users PC or Apple Mac users? What is their screen resolution? When does your traffic peak
in a 24 hour, weekly, monthly or annual cycle? All of these questions and more will be answered by
analyzing site data.
136

www.ecommercegetitright.com
One of the Many Google Analytics Reports Showing Various Site User Data
You Need Traffic To Analyze.
Its important you get your website traffic up to a reasonable number before you start to analyze,
respond and refine your site. If you start with only 10 visitors a day this is not enough to measure
and act upon. You need a good mixture of visitors from different demographics and I would wait
until you get at least 50100 people a day so you have enough metrics to judge and get actual and
reliable results. The more visitors per day the more accurate the data will be.
I also recommend analyzing at least 90 days to 180 days (3 months to 6 months) at a time, as this
will give you a very good mix of users and a good time scale to look at users habits and behaviors.
137

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Three Ways to Get User Data:
1. Add Google Analytics code to your website... its really easy.
Google Analytics is comprehensive and will tell you everything you need to know about your users
habits: the buttons and links they click and those they ignore; how much traffic you get and from
what country; bounce rates; where they abandon your checkout process; plus lots more
information. Your web developer should know about Google analytics  if not, turn and run!
Sign up for Google Analytics here: www.google.com/analytics/
2. With all standard hosting accounts, you get Web Stats (known as server logs) found in your
CPanel (Control Panel). You will need to ask your host for the username and password to
access these. Common server stats are AWStats and Webalizer.
3. Your e commerce software will come with its own reports, statistics and data too. Great for
analyzing orders, sales, refunds and product related information.
Test. Test. Test.
Testing and refining is about taking your e commerce website and business to continually higher
levels of growth using the principles detailed in the Key site Elements such as Design, Usability and
Conversion. If you analyze, you can respond positively to your available data, reports and statistics
on a monthly basis as a minimum with weekly or daily being optimum. Your competitors will not
know what has hit them. The more testing you do and the more website refinement you can
implement, ultimately the more products you will sell!
Successful websites including Amazon often run multiple tests on their website daily to gather data
and respond to the results. They test everything from a simple image placement on their homepage,
product layout, add to cart buttons, images, text, colors through to the messages and products you
see when you have placed an orderthe order confirmation page.
Key Data to Measure.
Here is a brief overview of the key metrics of your website to measure so you can refine your traffic
source and quality, lower your bounce rate and increase your conversion rate.
Unique Visitors or Absolute Unique Visitors  How many individual people came to your site
in a day, week, month or year. This is a key statistic to determine if your traffic is consistently
growing, remaining static or declining each day, week or month. Do not use visits or hits use
unique visits as this shows you each unique person as one visit.
Determining your Visitor to Sales ratio (Conversion Rate):
For example: (a) 1000 unique visitors per day enter your website and (b) 10 individual orders are
placed within this period. You divide the number of orders by the total unique visits to determine
the visitor to sales ratio.
138

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Conversion Rate Calculation: (a) 1000 / (b) 10 = Conversion Rate (i.e. 1 person in every 100 visitors
orders from your website)
Expressed as a Percentage: (b) 10 / (a) 1000 x 100 = Conversion Rate of 1%
To determine your monthly or annual visitor to sales ratio use the same calculation but add up your
total unique visits and orders placed within your desired period of time. Note: Do not use total
number of items sold as some people buy more than 1 item per order. You can filter this data
further by splitting visits by specific country of origin.
Page Views  Page views is the total number of pages viewed on your site and is a general
measure of how much your site is used. It is more useful as a basic indicator of the traffic
load on your site and server rather than as a marketing measure.
Bounce Rate  Bounce Rate is the percentage of single page visits (i.e. visits in which the
person entered and left your site on the same page without clicking to another page in your
site). Bounce Rate is a measure of visit/traffic quality and a high Bounce Rate typically
indicates that site entrance (landing) pages aren't relevant to your visitors. You can minimize
Bounce Rates by tailoring landing pages to each keyword and ad that you run. Landing pages
should provide the information and services that were promised in the ad copy (the
advertising that drew the visitor to your site in the first place.)
Time on Site  Time on Site is one way of measuring visit quality. If visitors spend a long time
visiting your site, they may be interacting extensively with it. However, Time on Site can be
misleading because visitors often leave browser windows open when they are not actually
viewing or using your site.
New vs. Returning Visits  A high number of new visitors suggests that you are successful at
driving traffic to your site while a high number of return visitors suggests that the site
content is engaging enough for visitors to come back. You can see how frequently visitors
return and how many times they return.
Country of Origin of Visitor (Map Overlay)  Determine what country and territory your
visitors are coming from. Use the available data maps to visualize volume (visits, page views)
and quality (page views per visit, conversion rates, per visit value, etc) metrics by geographic
region.
Note: Its important to determine your Visitor to Sales Conversion Rate by country as it may
be better than you at first thought. If 30% of your traffic is from overseas but you only ship
nationally then you can discard the international Unique Visits data from this calculation.
Direct Traffic  Establish who clicked a bookmark to come to your site or typed your site URL
into their browser and find out how they compare to the average visitor to your site. Direct
traffic can include visitors recruited via offline (i.e. print, television) campaigns. You can also
segment direct visits by city, visitor type, or other factors.
Search Engine Traffic  How much search engine traffic do you get and how does this
compare to traffic as a whole to your website? Find out which search engine your traffic
comes from. The available graphs detail overall trends from the various search engine traffic.
Keywords  Establish what keywords and key phrases your visitors are using to find your
website. Available graphs show overall trends from each keyword and its traffic origin. You
can segment the traffic referrals from each keyword by city, visitor type, or other factors.
139

What are Conversion Goals?
Goal conversions are the primary metric for measuring how well your site fulfills specific objectives.
A goal is a website page a visitor reaches once they have made a purchase or completed another
desired action, such as completing a contact form, registration or download.
How can Goals Help Me?
Once you have set your goals, you'll be able to see conversion rates and the monetary value of the
traffic you receive. You can also define a funnel path for each goal. A funnel path is the path you
want visitors to take to reach a goal. Defining a funnel path allows you to monitor how frequently
visitors who begin a conversion process actually complete it.
Goal 1 (Checkout Cart Abandonment)  Set up this goal funnel on your checkout process
from Shopping Cart/Basket page through each page/step to your Order Confirmation Page.
This will clearly breakdown and detail how many people enter and leave at each step and
how many people complete the checkout process and order from you.
Goal 2 (Contact Form Submission)  Use this goal to determine how many people enter your
contact form page and how many people actually submit the form to you.

Website Launch Essentials
When launching your website ensure your web developer sets up and installs these prior to launch.
This will ensure your website is optimized for Google, reporting and for testing.
1. Google Account or Google Apps Account.
Google Account and Google Apps both offer similar services and one of these will keep all your
Google tools and reports in the one account. For example you could use Gmail which is Googles
server based email service for your email client if you prefer that to a locally PC based email client.
The benefit of Google Apps allows you to have multiple email aliases (sales@, info@, etc) for the
one domain and gives you the option to use your actual domain in your email such as
info@yoursite.com whereas the basic Gmail account does not give you these two features. See the
full list of recommended Google Apps under Tools & Resources at the end of the book.
Google Accounts: www.google.com/accounts/
Google Apps: www.google.com/apps/
2. Google Webmaster Tools (XML Sitemap & URL to be indexed)
Google Webmaster Tools gives you some great features to maximize and promote your website with
Google. Get your webmaster to add an XML sitemap so whenever you amend or add a page to your
website Google knows instantly. Another great feature is the ability for you to inform Google which
URL you want it to index in its search index.
I highly recommend you submit using the full URL (domain name): http://www.yoursite.com as
opposed to http://yoursite.com. Most people will link to your main URL, be it organically (natural
linking) or by request. If you have both URLs in Googles index then your incoming link quantity will
be split between the two URLs, weakening the SEO power of each one.
You need only one URL indexed and all links working in synergy promoting the main URL. Log into
Google Webmaster Tools and ensure this is set to index: http://www.yoursite.com.
View Google Webmaster Tools: www.google.com/webmasters/tools/
142

www.ecommercegetitright.com
3. Site Submission.
In Addition to Setting up Webmaster Tools I also Like to Either:
a) Manually submit my sites to Googles index at the below web address, or
b) Link to my new website from an existing website that Googles spiders/bots visit on a daily or
regular basis. This is the quickest way to get your website indexed in Google.
Add your website to Googles index when live: http://www.google.com/addurl/
Now that your website is in development it is time to get ready to launch. Before you do, it is
important to run some quick tests to check for leaks in the system.
143

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Five Pre Launch Testing Requisites
1) Cross Browser & Platform Testing.
Test your website for load speed, correct operation, and usability, ensuring all design and layout
elements are in alignment on the page and in the correct locations. Also, test the screen resolution
to ensure the site table fits as intended in your users browsers without a scroll bar appearing at the
bottom. If your web designer has built the site correctly it will auto adjust for different screen
resolutions.
I recommend you actually run these tests in addition to your web developer, as you will often spot
things off balance that they miss.
Open your website in all browsers (on PC and Apple Mac) with different operating systems and
browser versions including but not limited to Internet Explorer (Versions 6, 7, 8), Firefox (versions 2
&3), Google Chrome, Opera and Safari. If you cant get all of these specific browsers to test, then
check with your friends, family and work colleagues. More often than not they will have older
versions of the operating systems and browsers.
2) W3C & Google Compliant.
Tim Berners Lee is the director of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Since 1994 the W3C has
provided the guidelines by which websites and web pages should be structured and created. The
rules they outline are based on best practices. While websites don't have to comply to be viewed
correctly in Internet Explorer and other popular browsers, there are a number of compelling reasons
why you or your designer should ensure that the W3C guidelines are followed and that your site is
brought into compliance.
Having said all that, dont get too hung up on errors the W3C validation tool throws up, as its pretty
pedantic. Putting it another way if your site looks good in all browsers when you test, what else do
you really need? You can run a check in the link below:
W3C Validator: http://validator.w3.org/
Google Compliant.
As Google is currently the number one search engine where most of a sites organic traffic will come
from, I focus on making my websites Google compliant as opposed to W3C compliant. Follow the
Google webmaster Guidelines and Googles help notes and youll be set to go.
Google Webmaster Guidelines: http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/
144

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Google Website Translator.
If you are using the Google Language Translator module, check for the positioning of text headers
and formatting site wide (across the entire website). As different languages result in words having
more letters, this could push one line onto the next line break. Note: Any text overflow present,
when your default language is converted, is something you may just have to accept. So weigh up the
cost of this text overflow versus the simplicity of using this module, and the extra sales you could
get as a result of selling globally.
3) Checkout Test.
Test the entire order process or sales funnel from site entry to order confirmation page. Is it easy to
navigate to products? To select quantity, size, color (or other options)? Does your cart page work
correctly and is it clear for customers what they should do next?
Really complete the order yourself, in order to test. Go through the checkout page or pages and read
the text. Does it read well and fluently making you understand the next step and then the next step
in this process? Look at the buttons. Are they positioned correctly and are they the right size and
color? Does the wording on your buttons make you want to click them?
When you get into the checkout area, is your SSL security certificate working? Are you getting the
padlock in your browser and has the web address (URL) changed to https as opposed to http?
Is it easy to enter your card details? Is it seamless between you and your payment gateway system
depending on type of payment set up and integration method used on your website or off your
website if you process offline? Does your payment gateway process your orders fast or is there a
long delay and does it hang for 30 to 60 seconds? If so you will lose customers, so iron this
resistance out. Do error messages appear when you place test transactions? Do the error messages
make sense and provide the appropriate action steps for your would be customer to continue with
their order successfully?
When you have ordered, are you getting the order confirmation page? Does everything work on
here? Are emails including the order receipt email, dispatch email, etc., all working and does the
order status feature in your back end admin work? Ensure you check all of this because your web
designer will not!
4) Website Forms & Email.
Test all forms and form confirmation pages. Test any contact forms and your email to ensure you
have pre and after sales contact. If you are using support center software, test this in all areas for
correct operation and communication to your back end systems. The same goes for any other forms
you may have, including email newsletter opt in forms give them all a thorough workout.
How many times have you submitted a contact form on a website and not been presented with a
contact confirmation page with a confirmation message? Just some simple reassurance like Thanks
for Emailing Us, We have received your contact message and will endeavor to respond within the
hour ? And when you didnt get this page and/or message, I know 100% you were left scratching
your head wondering if the website youd just emailed had received your enquiry or not.
145

www.ecommercegetitright.com
So use this page to give a confirmation message and links back to the home page or some other area
of your website you deem important. You could even place your email newsletter form on this page
with an inviting opt in message and/or place Google Adsense on here to make money on the exit
click.
Without this working efficiently customers will just get frustrated!
5) Usability Test.
Or as I like to call it the Mom Test (thats Mum if youre in the UK). Having made site changes
including website usability, text, image and button changes, I like to test these on my parents,
friends and family or anyone who I know who is inexperienced online.
Dont worry
this is not some cruel or lame experiment! Essentially, what I am saying is that after
making site changes, its good to take a step back and ask someone not involved with your
websiteespecially inexperienced web usersto see if they can comfortably use your website
effectively without resistance.
This will quickly find any problem areas in your design and usability. Remember, you have to build an
e commerce site for all ages, personality types, intelligence levels and for people with all degrees of
internet experience.
Its Now Time to Build Your Feature Rich E commerce Website...
If you have chosen the route of using branded e commerce software through an established site
design and development company, the next step is preparing a brief so your potential site builders
can review and respond with a quotation.
This should be clear and concise yet with sufficient information to cover all aspects of the build and
the features and modules you require. The quotes should follow your brief where possible so you
can compare with quotes from other companies.

Why Most Website Owners Get Disillusioned
And Their Websites Eventually Fail!
Why is it 97% of e commerce websites struggle to make profits for their first 3 years after launch,
and most just crash and burn? Well it all starts with your design team. Working with the right team
can mean the difference between success, or imminent and painful failure!
Note: In this chapter the term web designers covers web developers, web agencies,
etc.
Hiring a Web Designer  A Typical Scenario.
Ive dealt with many e commerce designers and developers since 2000 and have spoken with many
e commerce site owners and project managers since then. Let me share with you a mindset and
pattern that has become apparent, and that essentially creates the unnecessary struggle leading to
failure and ultimately bankruptcy.
You will See in Steps 2 & 3 how Critically Important Finding a Good Web Designer is:
1) Customer approaches web design company with brief for quotation >
2) Web designer promises exceptional site design and Top 10 SEO rankings >
3) Website is built, customer pays in full and the website is handed over. However
no training or insights into e commerce business success are given!
New website owner has no idea about Traffic > Conversion > Relationships >
4) After 3 months of low or no sales, customer thinks they need a big fat budget to
spend on SEO and marketing to make money online >
5) Customer gets disillusioned with limited sales, increasing costs and no profits >
6) Customer blames the internet for simply not being a way to make money >
7) Year 15: customer quits and closes the website down, with a big pile of personal
or business debt!

Effectively Communicating Your Website Brief to
a Web Designer
Effective and regular communication with your design team is essential to ensure you start on the
right path, execute quickly and efficiently, and produce an e commerce website that ultimately sells
products in big numbers and makes a great profit.
Getting a Quotation.
For a detailed and accurate quotation, based on your exact specification and requirements, your
designer will commonly email you a project brief form to complete and return. This covers most
aspects of the website build including logo, design to the feature list and modules required.
The quality and detail of this form will differ from designer to designer. If you need to send
additional details, do so as and when you think of them. However, to help the designer and keep
communication simple do your best to get it all in 13 emails.
Before you complete the project brief form I recommend drawing an outline of the website design
as you visualize it on paper, or on your PC using MindMaps, Word or Visio, etc. List the site
structure/layout as you see it, together with the feature list and modules required. I personally find
it useful to grab a pen and paper and let my creativity flow thru a brain dump. I later transfer this
onto the PC in an organized structure and into words for the designer in an email with attachments.
Let Your Designers Creativity Flow.
When completing the design aspect of the brief you can be as detailed, or as vague as you wish.
What I mean by this is, when you find a good designer be careful you do not give too much
information that may get in the way of the designers creative skills. I like to give them the site
concept, layout, and features required and let them to do the initial mock design selecting colors,
etc. and then refine where required to finalize the design.
Site Build Specifics to Email to Potential Designer:
Detail your goals for the website such as: Concept, Target Customer and Positioning.
Essentially, what is the site about, what will it give you and what will it get you?
Get a delivery date for the mock and live site and list the pre launch protocol.
Email 5 websites you like the design of and detail why.
Detail the design concept (layout, site structure, logo, fonts, and maybe colors, etc.)
List the features and modules you will need (number of products, product variables, order
and admin features, returns, SEO, marketing, reports, etc)
How many sales/conversions, what revenue do you want daily, monthly, annually?
Add as many points of your own, as you see fit.

How to Hire a High Quality Web Designer
You now have a solid e commerce foundation, mindset and philosophy, and you know exactly what
features, modules and options you want in your website. Its now time to hire a Website Designer
using the below top tips.
An exceptional web designer, developer or team will have great communication and fully
understand your e commerce goals based on experience. They will then produce a website that
works towards your goals, not just to bolster their own portfolio.
Are they Working for Your Benefit?
Unfortunately for you, the majority of web agencies couldn't care less if you succeed or fail and just
see each project as a wage. They turn over project after project to keep the sales momentum, so
they can pay the bills. Very few companies will ever contact you to see how your business is doing
with regards your sales and profits, and if you have successfully implemented traffic, conversions
and back end marketing.
It is actually in their best interests to see how they can improve these three key areas for you. Some
website performance changes could lead to a stronger portfolio for them. This is just another
example of the lack of awareness of marketing on the back end, for them.
Individual Designers vs. Design Team.
There are some great individual web designers available for hire who work for themselves, but a big
word of warning; there are only so many hours in a day and many only work Monday to Friday. You
need to establish, how much time they can allocate to your project with regards initial build and
after sales support and updates. I am not saying big design teams are better, as you may get more
focused attention from one on one.
Here are some Points to Consider:
Who can provide the most time and attention for your initial build and updates?
Do they have the experience as individual or collectively as a team?
If you are dealing with a web agency, can you speak directly with the designer or do you have
to go through a project manager? This can cause miscommunication and frustration.
If you have marketing deadlines to meet and need site changes such as promotional banners
or graphics, will your designer do whatever it takes to meet your schedule?
If you spot errors on the site or if the code breaks (it happens, especially after updates),
when will it be fixed? A design team may provide 24/7 support, an individual simply cannot.
Does your web designer or team pick up the phone if you call? Many will only communicate
by email.
If your website hosting fails at 9pm and your site goes down, is someone available to fix it?
150

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Does your web team have seamless communication between the different departments to
implement your ideas correctly and on time?
Do they have a newsletter or method of alerting you to new features & modules they
develop, which may be useful to your website and business?
151

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Ten Tips for Finding and Interviewing a Kick Ass
Web Designer
1) Are They Working for Your Benefit?
Is this a value for value exchange? Is the design company or individual working for your benefit, are
they taking a deep interest in your business and its success, or are they just concerned about their
bottom line? Many companies hand over your website, take your cash and swiftly disappear. You
need to know they have an interest in the results you get and are there to support you.
Do their current clients e commerce websites actually make a profit? Can they give you some
success examples and specific numbers? Not many can, as most e commerce sites bomb!
Is a system in place for alerting and updating you to new developments, for example if they develop
new features and site modules that will benefit your website and business? It is critical you stay on
the e commerce cutting edge.
2) Do They Understand Your Website and Design Goals?
Does your design team fully understand your goals? Select a web designer who understands e
commerce business in addition to great design. Ensure they have an e commerce portfolio with a
design style you like and an available demo site so you can take a test drive.
What is the point in buying a website that does not work? You would not drive a new car out of the
dealership with a flat tire. So get a website exactly as you want it, and one that works!
Can and will they make appropriate recommendations with regards the features and modules
required for your business? This is crucial for automation, synchronization, efficiency and
productivity.
3) Communication and Support.
Communication is essential before, during and after the project. Is communication limited to email
or do they take calls? What are their working hours and will they bend to accommodate important
deadlines for you? E commerce websites are a 24/7/365 business model dont forget that!
Ensure they can provide support manuals and/or videos for the e commerce software back end
admin and provide after sales training and support. I can guarantee you will need it, until you are
comfortable and experienced with the software.
What if the site code breaks and you spot errors, how fast can they fix it and do you have to pay for
these corrections?
4) Designer Availability.
When you have found a website design you like, establish if the original designer is available and will
be working on your project. Many companies especially those on the outsource websites such as
Elance, have a quick turnover of staff so this is important to find out.
152

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Also find out do they outsource themselves? This is critical, as many companies simply take your
order and pass the project on to another agency or designer. This is not a problem if the Project
Manager handling your project is exceptional, but very few PM's are of this quality in my experience.
This could lead to delays, support issues in the future and big frustration for you in the long term.
5) Get Protected.
Where possible get them to sign a contract that explicitly specifies four things.
Read more about this contract at: www.ecommercegetitright.com
The Project or Service they are providing you (for example Web Design)
1)
The Delivery Time for the project to be completed (for example 3 weeks)
2)
The total cost for the project (for example $1500)
3)
All intellectual property rights that make up the website are 100% yours and they cannot
use or replicate, this work again, unless they first consult with you and pay you an agreed
amount. You can also agree to share or you give them permission to use your development
work again if you wish. Ive paid big sums of money for the time to build bespoke modules,
only for my designer to use this on other sites at no cost. Big mistake!
Top Questions to Ask:
6) Detailed Quotation.
Get your designer to detail all of the costs and completion delivery times for the website build in a
written quotation, be it by email or letter. Get them to specifically detail:
Cost and delivery time for the initial mock design? (mock should be free)
Do you get unlimited revisions on the mock until you are happy with the design?
Cost and delivery time for the initial website build? (typically a one off price)
Cost for updates (typically billed per hour)?
Cost for support?
Cost for code error corrections?
Cost for SEO management and is this optional? (you will typically get better results at a lower
cost with a specialist SEO company)
Cost for hosting if they are hosting your website?
Can you deactivate features/modules you do not need to use from launch, but want to
activate later, and cost for activation?
Note: You could even set penalties for late delivery times where possible and within reason, such as
getting a 10% discount. Show them you are a serious business owner and wont accept inferior
service.
153

www.ecommercegetitright.com
7) Domain Name Ownership.
Ask can I register my own domain name, giving me full ownership and control and can I then point
the Name servers to your server (if they host your website)? Taking control of your own domain
name will prevent any problems over ownership in the future and will give you full control if you
wish to move designers or servers later on.
8) 100% Intellectual Property Rights?
When they have built your website, will they hand over all the intellectual property rights to you?
This means: are you the 100% legal owner of the whole website, including e commerce CMS
software, design, logo, graphics, images, text and web content, etc?
9) Design Skills.
Ask, what software do you use to design? If they hard code with HTML they will usually have more
skills and produce a better site with more features and more flexibility than someone who uses
Adobe Dreamweaver or another WYSIWIG software like Microsoft Front Page or XsitePro.
10) Are They Experts?
Do they have an outstanding portfolio and the knowledge to back it up? Ask them to explain, how
they will structure your website for customer usability and conversion and for SEO purposesfor
the search engine spiders. Ask them directly what is your model or formula for design specifics like
alignment, colors and font? If they cannot answer these Qs with great articulation and passion,
then find a new designer.
Additional Points:
a) Mock Design.
Ensure your designer uploads your mock design onto a live test site/URL, so you can see exactly
what it will look like on a live site. View in 100% size on a live site with full design implemented as
intended. Many designers are lazy and will send you a 50% completed mock design as a jpg image.
Viewing as a mock image often gives a poor reflection of the intended quality and site design,
especially if you cannot view as 100% size, this happens in some picture viewers. Also, get them to
design the mock in various color schemes so you can select your favorite. This is very easy for them
to do and gives you more options.
If they give you an incomplete mock, get them to complete it first before making a decision. An
incomplete mock is like seeing an architects plan for your new house that shows only the floor area,
and no side elevation, no windows, no doors, no roof, no stairs, etc. Its hard to visualize the finished
product, and impossible to assess its suitability.
b) Hosting.
If they provide you with hosting, ensure their servers are of the highest quality, have as close to
100% uptime as possible, can provide you with secure hosting via SSL and that you fully understand
their hosting charges, be it monthly or annually. What is the support provided if the site goes down?

Ten Things Your Web Designer May Not Want
You to Know!
As we now know, web agencies, designers, developers and graphic designers are not all created
equal or even as good as they claim to be. Do they cover things up? If so, what do they commonly
hide?
1) You Must Register and be the Sole Controller of Your Domain Name... And
Retain 100% Intellectual Property Rights to Your Website.
Always buy and register your own domain name and forward the name servers to the server/hosting
company where your website is hosted. If your design company insists that they wish to buy and
control the domain, turn and run!
There are a massive number of people/businesses that have been slapped by web companies
unwilling to play fair. They will not release the ownership and control over to the rightful owner. This
tends to happen when the customer realizes they want full control of the domain, so they can move
to a new designer, etc.
On a website I built for a client, it took about 6 months of negotiations and frustration to (a) locate
the company in control of the name, (b) get a transfer deal sorted and (c) get them to actually action
the transfer.
A big tip is to make sure you register your domain name before revealing it to anyone, as some
bandits will go and register it quick, as soon as you mention it and try to charge you a fortune for it!
Your website intellectual property rights also need protection. Make sure from the outset you have
100% legal ownership of software, images, text, etc. created for your site. If they want to use any
aspect of your site, which you conceived and built, such as bespoke modules and features, then they
have to pay you for it at your desired asking price. Where possible, get them to sign a contract to
back up this agreement.
2) Who is Designing Your Website?
When you highlight a website design as one you like, before agreeing to hire a designer it is essential
to establish who built the website you like. Then find out if the original designer is available to build
your website. Every person on the planet has his or her own perception of a clean, dynamic and
professional website. So whatever your website brief, you need a designer who has the same
perspective as you do, based on existing site designs you have seen.
155

www.ecommercegetitright.com
3) What Level of Service do They Provide to Support You and Your Website?
24/7/365?
Most web companies have no idea and no interest in your business or your long term success, fact!
They like to build you a website, take your money, add the site to their portfolio and disappear. But
they are very interested if you are happy to spend more on a monthly maintenance fee or for
SEOas some companies position it. Be very wary of these services unless you get a detailed plan
of what they are doing and what you are getting for your money. Results are all that counts, so offer
to pay on results, and see if youre dealing with professionals or just hot air!
Do your best to find a company or developer who has the X Factor! Hire someone that has an
interest in your business results and growth and communicates well. If they provide you with
hosting find out what they will charge, and what their uptime is (youll need uptime very close to
100%.)
Its also critical to establish what handover training they will give you and your team when your site
goes live. Is it a 30 minute demo of the back end and then they say goodbye? Is it just ring or email
with any questions at any time?Do they charge for this? If you are new to e commerce, you will
without a doubt need help getting familiar with the software and processes.
4) Running a Profitable E commerce Website is not Easy.
Do you recall the Traffic > Conversion > Relationship model?
Miss this foundational strategy and fail to implement this and the other tips in this book  and
competitors will absolutely take the sales you miss. You need to work hard to attract customers and
convince them to buy from you, and thats only part of it. You also have to buy products, handle
products, ship products, deal with customer service and all the other elements of an e commerce
business. There is a lot of work involved without a doubt. It comes down to how much you want it to
be successful.
You have heard the superlatives that are essential to achieve success like creativity, passion and
tenacity. While these are good traits to have, but also build on a solid foundation of planning,
common sense and watching the financials and the numbers.
You will never achieve a successful e commerce business, or any business for that matter, working
on recreational time. You need to put in the hours, and even if you outsource the majority of tasks,
you still need to keep in touch and watch your outsourcer team, marketing, sales and profits to stay
on target.

5) Your Competitors are Constantly Trying to GET Ahead of You in the Search
Engine Rankings.
Business is business and if you do not take the sales on offer, a competitor will gladly take them
from you. So watch them closely, monitor their websites often, and use GoogleAlerts and software
such as Copernic Tracker. If you follow the strategies in this book and on www.ecommercejuice.com
you will have the robust foundations you need to kick ass in e commerce and SEO!
6) If You do Not Update Your Website Often, You will Lose Business.
Follow the principles in the book by blogging at least once every 1 to 3 days where time and money
allows. If you can, add keyword rich blogs daily and allow blog comments to site users to get new
and regular content, but watch for spam and negativity. Also, continue to add keyword rich articles
and how to guides often. Add a customer review module so your product pages get fresh content as
and when a new product review is submittedand frequently with your product keyword or key
phrase in the review. Also add new products, where feasible, on an ongoing basis.
This does not mean change your homepage, info page or product page content every week, just to
have changes. It means keep updating and adding site pages in a way that brings value to your
customers and gets you further along to your business goals. Do not let your site get rusty.
7) Customers will Not Find Your Website just Because it is Live.
Yes, as we discussed in the 97% of e commerce sites make $0 profits in their first 3 years statistic,
this means you should be marketing your website on a weekly basis, if not daily. Spend time working
on your website as opposed to working in your business running it. However, this is the big
challenge especially when it comes to e commerce, which is why using efficient systems,
automation, and speed are essential.
There is an old quote about business early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and advertise. The
point here is the word advertise. Without it your business will never reach its full potential. You
have to be assertive and not passive; I would even upgrade assertive to aggressive!
8) You Need to Test Your Website Across Multiple Browsers and Platforms.
Its very important to check your website daily by simply skipping through the key pages, categories
and processes to ensure all is working fine. Websites and HTML can break without warning
especially after updates (for example, if your web developer uploads and downloads product CSVs
often.) If people cannot view your site in their chosen browser or platform, your sales will be hit.
Open your website in all browsers (on PC and Apple Mac) including but not limited to Internet
Explorer (Versions 6, 7, 8), Firefox (versions 2 &3), Google Chrome, Opera and Safari. If you cannot
157

www.ecommercegetitright.com
get all of these specific browsers to test, ask your friends, family and work colleagues. More often
than not they will have older versions of these browsers and operating systems.
9) Your Website should be Built using CSS and a CMS to Work Faster and More
Efficiently.
Ensure your developers build your website using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) so the html code is
clean, which essentially means it will load fast, Google can easily index your site and if you make
changes to design elements, these can be replicated across the site in a snap, as opposed to
updating every page independently. Also, build your e commerce site using a Content Management
System (CMS) software. This is the engine of your website: its high quality, robust back end
software allowing easy customer and product management, products additions, order processing
and returns, etc.
10) You could Save Money into the Future if You Get All of Your Required Features
in the Initial Website Build.
You will need to quiz your developers on this, but in my experience if you do not get as much of your
future start up site development work, features and modules as you believe you will need into your
initial site build, you will have unnecessary costs later on. This is because the initial build is generally
charged at a set price, and updates will be billed by the hourly rate (normally $50 plus per hour.)
Therefore, brain dump what you want from the site now and into the future. Modules and features
you do not need when you launch can simply be deactivated until you need them and switched on
later.

My Story: Hiring Inept Web Designers & Crooks
My internet experience began in Feb 2000, 2 months prior to the Dot Bomb era when the big
investment hungry internet businesses imploded, changing the value of web businesses forever. At
the time, I sold and installed car audio products such as CD players, speakers, amps, etc, to local
offline customers. The business was only 6 months old at this point when I discovered the internet
through a media frenzy in my local area.
The local news on TV visited an internet company who sold domains, hosting and websites. They
themselves were only about 6 months old but were raking in money left and right from
unsuspecting, and very internet naive customers, who had no suspicion in April 2000 that 5 page
websites they were currently paying thousands for would suddenly be worth about 70% less. This
was the dot.com crash, when investors suddenly realized the value of web businesses had been
massively over inflated!
I say frenzy above. In the office of this web company was an electronic scoreboard and an alarm.
Every time a sales rep sold a website over the phone, the bell would ring and the scoreboard would
add another sale on. Not only that, but the office members would jump to their feet and party
every time the alarm rang! However, this was not destined to last for long, and the company no
longer exists...
This buzz got me hooked, and I subsequently bought my first domain name and 5page website
called caraudioworx.com from this very company, and it cost me $1000 approx (£1500). It was a
brochure website with about three paragraphs of text and one or two images per page. Any good
web designer could knock it up now in about an hour. So I now had an exciting new revenue stream
to add to my existing business model, what could possibly go wrong? Well as it happens, everything
pretty much did!
In May 2000 I started to study internet marketing whenever I wasnt driving my van around the
Northwest of England, fitting and selling car audio products. Around this time I bought an accounts
software product to handle my books and inside was a free book called 10 Powerful Marketing
Strategies That Make $Millions by Paul F. Gorman. This was to change my career and business from
that day.
I wanted to learn more and became a marketing sponge and subsequently got my hands on Paul
Gormans classic How to Out Sell, Out Market, Out Promote, Out Advertise Everyone Else You
Compete Against. From this one book I started to write copy and market in the big glossy car
magazines, at a big cost. From June to December 2000 I spent $7.5K on advertising, sending traffic
directly to my new, killer website.
6 Months later... not a single email, phone call or sale through the site! I was devastated. My credit
cards were now maxed out and I was $10K in debt from my first website venture. This included
initial purchase, hosting, magazine advertising, banners, flyers and business cards. So much for my
new found web skills. January 2001 I shut my first website down!
3 months later I tried again and paid $2000 to a back street web designer for an e commerce
website this was supposed to have all the e commerce bells and whistles and 500 products. June
159

www.ecommercegetitright.com
2001 arrived and still no website or web store, so I junked this project too after trying to locate my
web designer who had disappeared with my hard earned cash. I was now $12K in the red on
websites and marketing in just 12 months.
From 2000 2004, Web Designers and E commerce Software were Mediocre at best! But this Cash
Problem had to Change, and Fast...
October 2001, my website failure experience started to pay off and by Xmas CarAudioPlus.co.uk
was turning over good money and from there the very successful InCarNetwork.com was born. I
sold this network early 2007, so please do not contact the current owners.
If you have, any e commerce Questions ask me at: www.ecommercejuice.com
I will not bore you with all my other successful and non successful web investments and money
squandering but I can reveal one thing. Of the 100 plus outsourcers and web companies/individuals
I have used, I would only use about 510% again. This in itself shows you the overall standard of skill
online. Just look on Elance.com and the other outsource websites: not many providers have top
feedback ratings.
There is one outsourcing project I would like to mention, to help save you the time, hassle and
money I was conned out of. Back in 2003 I was building a feeder site network of 3 information
websites to send highly targeted traffic to my then (growing rapidly) car audio and in car
entertainment e commerce website network, InCar Network.com.
I posted a project on Elance for a High Quality Copywriter. From the 30 or so responses I got, was a
very articulate and polite guy called Chimezirim Chinecherem Odimba who claimed at the time he
was an American based writer. In retrospect I should have Googled him to check.
Anyway as it turned out, this guy was a con artist from Nigeria and because my websites were
growing so fast and the business needed my focus, I wasnt giving this project the attention it
deserved. I was continually giving the OK for my accountant to transfer money over to him on
request and I wasnt checking his work. The result is that I ended up spending about £2K ($3.3K)
with nothing in return, as one day he decided to change the passwords to the feeder sites and
essentially stole my websites, disappeared and I never heard from him again.
160

www.ecommercegetitright.com
So what Lessons have I learned, that will Help You when Hiring?
Avoid pretentious fancy pants web design agencies and absolutely avoid back street web
designers who build websites on the run, and can disappear without trace at anytime. Check
portfolios, testimonials and references from happy customers, and get training and
guarantees.
Always keep control of your websites. Host them on your server account where possible. If
your outsourcer then decides to change your password, you can always get it back from the
hosting company because the account is in your name.
If you are running outsource projects, set timelines and delivery dates and check them off as
the project is delivered. Keep this plan so you know your targets. Where possible, pay on
results.
Do not pay up front. If they need a deposit, then pay a small token deposit and pay in stages
as and when the project is delivered. For example, pay a 10% deposit, 40% half way through
the build and then the remaining 50% upon completion. Handle the project on your terms
and not theirs but make it fair for both parties in case you wish to pull out at any stage.
Accept that with most web designers, there is no loyalty. If a bigger and better project comes
their way, they wont hesitate in putting your project on hold while they go where the money
is.
Do your best to protect your work, which you have creatively designed and paid for. Its 100%
yours and not the designers. They have merely implemented your ideas and you have paid
for that: you legally own the intellectual property rights to this design or software.
Do not trust anyone! Be very wary of Yes men who are really nice but very vague and say
Yes to everything you ask them. Show them you are the boss and they will respect you in
return. And, dont be afraid to walk away if youre not happy with them.

Marketing Plan
Step 4 is an overview of the marketing strategies available for your e commerce store. E commerce
marketing does not have to be complex; it is about forecasting what extra sales you want, setting
budgets and measuring your results. If it works and generates sales, keeping doing it and if costs rise
but sales do not, try something else.
Having said that, do you need a 20 page marketing plan to get started? No. Simply establish where
you are and where you want to be with regards traffic and sales, plan your numbers in a
spreadsheet, detail your marketing model in MindManager, Visio or Word and take action. Just one
thing it isnt easy finding impartial marketing advice online. Ill do my best below.
Front End (Acquisition) Marketing
This simply means the process of acquiring customers to buy your products. After youve invested
money on your website build, you then need to attract prospects to your site via marketing. Once
they have purchased from you and become your customer you then use back end marketing to
build a relationship and offer them more products.
Google Product Search.
Google Product Search (formerly known as Froogle), is a price comparison service launched by
Google in 2002. It helps online shoppers find and buy products across the web. As a seller, you can
submit your products to Google Product Search, giving your site exposure and allowing shoppers to
easily and effortlessly find your website.
Increase Traffic and Sales.
Product Search connects your products to the shoppers searching for them, helping you drive traffic
to your store resulting in sales. Your products will appear on Google Product Search and may even
be displayed in the Google search engine results, depending on your items' relevance.
Submit Products for Free.
Inclusion of your products is completely free. There are no charges for uploading your items or the
additional traffic you receive.
Reach Qualified Shoppers.
Reach shoppers precisely when they are searching for items to buy on Google.
Google Product Search interface provides a basic search box into which a shopper can type product
queries to return lists of vendors selling a particular product, as well as pricing information. Product
Search is only available for selected countries.
Find out more at: http://www.google.com/products or http://www.google.co.uk/products
163

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Google Product Search is different from other price comparison services in that it neither charges a
listing fee, nor accepts payment for products to show up first. In addition, it makes no commission
on sales.
Any company can submit individual and bulk products via two ways:
Data Feed.
Google recommends creating a data feed which contains all of your content in a single tab delimited
text or XML file. You can send them your data feed directly through your Google Merchant Center
account, or by using File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
API.
The Google Base API is designed for developers with technical know how who would like to
integrate their applications with Google Merchant Center. Your application can upload new data,
update or delete existing items, and query Google Merchant Center data to find matches for
complex attribute criteria.

The Power of SEO (Search Engine Optimization)!
When your prospect searches for your product, the Google search engine conducts a series of
simultaneous calculations requiring only a fraction of a second. The results are determined by votes
(links also known as backlinks) and Googles PageRank algorithm, named after Googles co founder
Larry Page.
When e commerce websites are built correctly from the ground up, integrating specific and
advanced on site White Hat SEO techniques, they become explosive SEO machines! I love and
utilize e commerce combined with SEO techniques for this very reason. White Hat simply means
ethical, and in line with Googles recommended practices.
Successful SEO is built on a formula that once learned can be used on any website and in any market
to compete with or even obliterate the big boys.
Halfords.com for example have over four hundred stores in the UK, a massive website and a budget
many times bigger than mine, yet they could not compete in the search engines for many
competitive terms in the car audio, in car entertainment market when I competed with them. For
example, they could not touch us for terms like iPod Car Kit and we dominated this competitive
online space. They may have had the budget, but unless you know what to do with it, its pretty
useless.

Top 4 Position Google Ranking with Google Site Links Below the Listing. Site Links are Awarded to
Category Dominating Websites and Here They List Your Popular Website Links
The SEO foundation and formula for Google, MSN (Now Bing) and Yahoo, the big 3 search engines, is
pretty much the same and your website should use this formula.
On Site SEO Basics:
1) Keywords & Key phrases
Lots of high quality keyword and key phrase rich and fresh content, updated often via articles, blogs,
products and customer reviews. Google frowns upon duplicate or plagiarized content and the
original content always scores the highest. If you do steal content then you could be dumped out of
the search engines, so be warned.
2) Meta Tags
Strong on Page Meta Tags: Page Titles, Description, Keywords and H1, H2, tags. Use of Alt tags on
images.
165

www.ecommercegetitright.com
3) Design
Strategic site design, layout, and structure and site templates that follow the 3 F's formula
Fast,
Functional and Familiar. Clean code and use of CSS is a must.
4) Google Bot Friendly
Implement an easy to follow path for the search engine bots (spiders), ensuring the center container
loads first with text and then the header, footer and sides of the main site template. You must use
more content in the center container than the other areas of the site template, ensuring each page
is unique.
5) Optimize PageRank
PageRank Optimization using key strategies, including the No Follow tag (see image below). This
passes Google PageRank around your site structure to key pages and blocks non key pages from
using up this valuable Google juice.
6) Internal Linking
Use key internal linking strategies to pass PageRank as above but also to gain indent listings in the
Google search results and create your own on site link machine. Indent listings equal more search
result real estatethat in turn results in more clicks.
7) Related Terms
The use of related terms within your content is critical as this gives you an edge. For example if you
are selling a HD TV, you would also use terms like Television, DVD, HDMI, Accessories, etc. These
related terms all add to the Google attraction, as it deems you an expert and content machine.
8) Clean URLs
Use clean URLs such as www.yoursite.com/tv accessories
9) Create Many pages
The more pages your site has, the more internal links you will have, and you will accumulate and
preserve page rank better. Do not delete pages of products you no longer need. Either 301 redirect
these to your new page, or hide them deep within your website and place a keyword rich link to
your new page, sending traffic across.
10) Unique Page Titles & URLs
Every page on your website must have unique page titles and URLS (page names).
166

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Word of Warning! Do Not rely on Google and Natural Search for 100%
of your Traffic. If Google ever changes its algorithm and this is your
only traffic source, your business could sink!
Off Site SEO Basics.
Links.
Links to your website are counted by the search engines as votes. Ultimately, the more one way
incoming links (backlinks) you have pointing to your site and key pages in addition to a minimum
level of quality per link, the higher your site will rank in the search engine results. However, this
formula only works if the on site SEO is rock solid too. Think you can have one without the other?
Forget it. You need a strong mix of good on site and good off site SEO.
Organic Link Building.
Once a website launches, if it is interesting and newsworthy, and people like the content, products
or design, etc., then it becomes talked about, quickly gaining in popularity, and the brand ultimately
gets exposure. What happens next affects your Google Top 10 assault. People who have websites or
use websites such as blogs, forums and social sites start to talk about you. From this, links are
naturally built: the more exposure you get, the more natural and FREE links people will make to your
site. This is a big bonus of organic link building!
This is Massive Momentum! You have heard about the snowball rolling down a hill getting bigger
and bigger. This is the same, and the effect is viral! When building a website it is a good idea to
choose a domain name with your main keyword and then brand it, so when people naturally link to
TVDirect.com, they will generally use keywords such as TV Direct' or Buy TV' in the anchor text
(the text link pointing to the website). This further bolsters your link reputation.
In line with the points above, if you can highlight something that is news or buzz worthy about your
website and/or products then you can get a viral effect going.
Link Bait.
Following on from the above points, give a good reason for other sites to link to yours. Post unique,
interesting and useful articles, blogs and information. Run offers, discount codes and promotions.
Offer exclusive products and how to videos and think of ideas to get a buzz going.
167

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Deep Links.
Links should not only link exclusively to your homepage. Point links to your main category and key
product pages too, via external or internal (on site) sources. These are Deep Links. Remember
Google ranks pages not websites, so each page is ranked on its own merits, which means each page
needs links and PageRank.
Link Sources.
Here is a list of the many resources you can use for gaining links to your website, if the links are
followed. This means they must NOT have No follow tags.
Blog Commenting
Forum Commenting
Article Directories
Press Releases
Social Bookmarking
Social Networking
Article Distribution
Shopping Directories
Affiliate Marketing
Paid Links
Main Key Phrases vs. Long Tail Key Phrases.
When you start to perform keyword research, you will find your main key phraseslots of search
volumewill account for approximately 20% of your keywords total, and the 80% of key phrases will
have much smaller search volumethese are Long Tail key phrases. This means if you target the
Long Tail key phrases (the lesser searched for keywords and key phrases) you can get more traffic
overall, as added up they swamp the main keywords. This is an essential strategy if you are in a very
competitive market, where all the players are targeting the main key phrases. Blogs and articles are
ideal for long tail keywords.
Not only that, long tail keywords and phrases rank faster than main keywords and phrases. Ive had
long tail terms rank top 10 in Google within 1 3 weeks.
Main Keyword Example: Panasonic TV
Long Tail Keyword Example: Panasonic TX L37V10B LCD TV with Stand
168

Example of PageRank Distribution using No Follow Tags
Google Local.
Google Local gives you the opportunity to target your website specifically at local customers. If you
optimize your Google Local advert well, you will within time get top ranking positions for your local
search main key phrases. In the search result listing itself, you have the benefit of a map and the
address of your location, which greatly emphasizes your listing in the search results.

Article Marketing.
Content makes the Internet what it is. One of the best marketing and SEO strategies that you can do
for your e commerce site is to write articlesor hire a freelance author to write articles for you
and submit them to the popular article directories. More articles submitted equal more incoming
links and more entry pages to your website. This will ultimately provide natural and unique content,
which Google loves, and it will also find a keyword rich link back to your website in the article
resource boxfound at the bottom of the article.
169

www.ecommercegetitright.com
The fundamental tips for writing and submitting good articles are to keep them around the 400600
words mark, use a keyword rich title, use good keywords in the body copy and utilize the resource
box and point a text link back to your site by using good keyword rich, and compelling text. Article
marketing is not complex!
Article directories you can use to generate links back to your website for your chosen keywords:
Ezine.com
Amazines.com
ArticleBliss.com
Article Buzz.com
ArticleCity.com
ArticleDashboard.com
E Articles.com
GoArticles.com
IdeaMarketers.com
Upublish.com
Plus, there are many more! This is your opportunity to submit unique and product relevant content
based on your niche market to a number of article directories. Not only will this establish you as an
expert in your industry, but it will also provide a swarm of natural backlinks to your website.
Pay Per Click (PPC).
Pay Per Click advertising is a great way to get your website instant traffic by using Googles
advertising model (Google Adwords). Microsoft and Yahoo also offer the PPC advertising model but
their user interfaces are complex and their search engines cannot get close to Google with regards
quantity and quality of users and searchers. I recommend starting with Google and investing your
time, energy and money here.
Google Adwords delivers targeted advertising like no other medium. Long gone are the days of
wishing and hoping your advertising works. By running tailor made adverts (Adwords), you are using
Googles actual search data, which has been collected and collated every second of every day from
millions of searches. It doesnt get more targeted than this.
Essentially Pay Per Click is like an auction. By targeting specific keywords and key phrases, you can
get immediate exposure based on your allotted daily budgetyou determine this inside of your
Adwords account. As an advertiser, you pay Google for every click a visitor makes, when they enter
your website through your Adwords advert. It is important to start with small click prices, hone your
skills in your particular market or niche and then roll out more adverts once your Click to Conversion
rate is profitable.
The good news is Google uses two factors Relevancy and Quality Score to reward the best
Adwords adverts and positions them higher on the page, even if you pay less per click than your
170

www.ecommercegetitright.com
rivals. Components making up the Quality Score include your account CTR (Click Through Rate), the
quality of your landing page (i.e. website pages) and relevancy, plus other factors.
When searchers type in a specific search term, the Adwords adverts appear in two sections of the
page; at the top and to the right of the natural search engine results. They also appear on Product
Search results and on other private websites as Adsense. They will also list on matching content
sites via the Adwords Contextual Advertising option within your Adwords account. I recommend you
switch off the Contextual Advertising Option as it is relatively inefficient at matching ads with
relevant websites, in my experience.
The use of Adwords banner ads is an open market right now with low click fees and lots of
opportunity without the high competition. Success with Adwords takes time, means creating lots of
ads and testing and refining as you develop your skill set. This means creating many Adwords
accounts, each with its own Campaigns, Ad Groups and keywords.
To create multiple Adwords accounts and to keep them all in one place use Adwords Client Center.
And make sure you let Google know that you are an Advertiser when creating this one big account
by selecting this option in the set up. To easily manage your big list of keywords try Adwords Editor.

Landing Pages.
A landing page can be any page on your website or off your website you specifically send traffic too
with the aim of converting into a sale. By off your website, I mean specific pages built off site or not
linked to your other site pages as part of the normal site structure.
Landing pages (also known as squeeze pages) are used as a powerful lead generation tactic, and
optimizing these via split testing and multivariate testing can super charge your profits. The idea
behind landing pages is to decrease bounce rate and on the flip side to increase visitor response and
stickiness on your website. Bounce rate, if you recall, is determined by the number of visitors that
enter on a specific page on your website and leave on the same page without clicking to another
page. As already discussed less than one in every one hundred visitors to your website will convert
(buy, opt in to your newsletter, contact you, complete a survey, etc) and the rest will leave without
taking action or doing your most wanted response.
Landing pages are designed to send potential customers (prospects) directly to individual, bespoke
and tailor made pagesvia Google Adwords or other sourcesbefore they are shown your main
product website. This is to build a relationship prior to offering information and products to them. E
commerce websites very rarely use landing pages but they can be very powerful when used
correctly. Further to your advantage is the fact that not many people even know how to build them
effectively, especially for e commerce websites.
However, if you try to run landing pages as part of your marketing strategy and get it wrong, you
could lose even more customers before they even see your main product site.
171

www.ecommercegetitright.com
You can use landing pages to capture email opt ins or get a sale by taking visitors directly to a
specific product. Landing pages are often used to capture the prospects name and email address in
exchange for an incentive such as a free report, how to guide or a discount code for your e
commerce store. You can then use this new lead to contact via email marketing to promote your e
commerce site and products.
You need to weigh up your bounce rate and visitor to sales conversion rate and optimize these as
well as you can prior to implementing landing pages. When new customers enter your website, are
they finding the info and products they need and are they converting? Or do you first need to
communicate with them and build a relationship via your email list, by giving a free report, free
video or other technique using the landing page tactic?
Split Testing and Multivariate Testing.
Most e commerce websites do not test their pages and its contents for conversion efficacy. Their
owners create content, upload it on to the live site and forget about it. The way to find the
difference between a high converting page and an inferior page or pages, is split testing.
Split Testing.
With split testing, you run two or three different designs of the same page against each other,
sending customers randomly to the various pages in the test and tracking the results. When a
winning page becomes evident, you discard the losing pages and keep the winner. You then create a
copy of the winner and start the split testing again by substituting a single element such as a
headline or image and measuring the new results. You then keep refining various elements of the
page to increase response, conversions or even triple sales.
When split testing, you only test one element of a page at a time and therefore it can take a while to
get a sure fire winner. There is a faster way...
Multivariate Testing.
This method of testing overcomes the time problem in split testing, by testing multiple variables on
the same page at the same time. All this is tracked by multivariate testing software. Anything from
headlines, images, guarantees, phone number placement, security logos, etc, can be tested
simultaneously.
Start by Testing these Pages:

Google Website Optimizer.
Integrating the Google Website Optimizer with your website enables you to test your ideas, with
real and actual mathematical results. Implementing optimized pages increases the value of your
traffic without increasing your marketing budget.

Newsletters.
When a visitor leaves your website, then as a minimum you want them to have signed up to your
newsletter or subscribed to your RSS feed or even clicked an Adsense link making you money on the
exit click. Having them place an order is obviously the goal, but with only .07 in every 100 visitors
buying, we have a large number of visitors where we still need to capture their email address before
they leave. Once we have the email address we can communicate with them often and offer advice,
information and then products.
To get people to opt in to your email newsletter you can give incentives like a discount code (money
off voucher), a free report, how to guide or even a free video. When you have built a rapport with
them, offer them products.
173

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Opt in Form.
The opt in form is normally positioned in the left or right hand column, in the footer or on a specific
page, such as the contact and order confirmation page. It can also be presented in a Pop Up or Pop
Under box that appears when your site visitor enters or exits your website.
Email Newsletter Opt in Box Example in Footer of Website
A pop up box appears on top of your open window and a pop under box or advert appears
underneath their open window.
I like to test these on an e commerce store and place the opt in form in the left or right column, on
the order confirmation page and I like to test it on Exit not entry. When a visitor is leaving your
website, this is the ideal time to hit them with a pop up box with a compelling headline and
incentive. The customer is already leaving so you have nothing to lose at this point. However, this
needs testing, as some pop up software can be a bit aggressive and even ugly.
Example Opt in Box Text for an E commerce Website Selling Guitars:
Wait! Grab a free discount code now, good for 10% off any product on GuitarsOnline store. Plus,
well send you a free exclusive report Learn to play the guitar like a pro! FREE in the next 60
seconds.
Blog Marketing.
If you are wondering what this has to do with marketing your e commerce business, then it is very
simple. It creates lots of SEO friendly content!
Google constantly searches for and recognizes new content. Blogs especially are regarded as fresh
and relevant content that Google likes to supply to its Google searchers. Google ranks blogs rapidly
and high in its search engine results. This is why I recommend you write and post blogs so often.
When you have written and published your blogs on your live site, the Ping Option within the back
end admin of your blog will inform the blog search engines such as Technorati.com, that a new blog
has been published, and this is great for SEO.
174

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Blog Frequency.
Daily or weekly blogs are important because they establish you as an expert in your product
category, market or niche and from this valuable information frequency, you can build a loyal
following.
Let's be realistic. There will be lots of existing companies in your category or market already
promoting the same products as you, so what will set you apart? You must establish yourself as an
expert if you want to gain credibility over your competition. For example if you are selling guitar
products this may already be a competitive market
The best thing you can do for your site is to write a keyword rich blog on a daily basis (where
possible) about guitars and the guitar industry. This does not mean you already have to be an
expert, but you must position yourself as an expert in this industry, and write captivating and useful
content, educating your readers and inspiring your audience to want to buy from you.
Suppose your market is the wine market, and youve been blogging about different types of wine.
Consequently, if anyone in any country on the planet is typing into the Google search box what is
the difference between red and white wine your blog stands a great chance of coming up at the top
of the search results. People may read your blog, but the goal is to subtly, and swiftly transfer them
from your blog to your products so they can purchase wine and wine accessories from you! This
strategy works well repeatedly.
Every time you write and post a blog, another page is added to your website page total, ultimately
giving you more weight in the eyes of Google. From an SEO perspective, the more pages you have
on a website, the better.
The truth is you need to do everything you can to add control and influence to your websiteand
one of the main resources in doing so is in creating your own blog. You can use these same blog
topics to submit articles to the directories we previously discussed, further establishing yourself as
an expert, drawing more traffic through content, and even gaining links back to your website.
Alarming Blog Statistic:
Of the more than 130 million blogs active since 2002when blogging startedits estimated that
over 90% are now dormant. This just reinforces the need to promote your blog for the search
engines and add fresh new content often (three blogs a week or even daily where possible.)
On Site Articles.
On Site Articles are different to the SEO articles mentioned above. On site articles are of higher
quality. As a rule they are 500800 words or longer and are designed to rank well in Google as well
as being written for your on site visitors to read. Topics covered are buyers guides, how to and
technical articles, all written with persuasion to sell your products while optimized to rank high in
Google. You can link to your on site article directory from your site footer, customer support pages
or a promotional block in your site template.

Video Marketing.
Video is an excellent medium for you to give your name and your face visibility as an expert in your
marketplace and to convert browsers in to buyers.
Video Ideas:
1) You can produce product sales videos, product demo videos, product review videos,
customer product review videos, technical product videos and testimonial videos.
2) Create a YouTube account and host your videos there. Make them shorter than 10 minutes
as YouTube has a file size limit. You can then grab the YouTube code, unique for each video
you submit and embed this code on to your website page.
3) You can submit any number of videos directly to YouTube or Google Video, etc., on your
niche market that will give prospects the opportunity to get to know you. Studies have
shown that people respond well to video because more of the five senses are being used in
comparison to reading text. Also, as a merchant you can quickly build trust with face to face
contact.
If you do use landing pages (or opt in squeeze pages) in your e commerce marketing strategy
you can also use your voice or video to help people emotionally connect to you, your website
and your products directly on the landing pages. Then at the end of the video tell them to
opt in to your email list, click to a specific page on your site or even forward the video to a
specific product page.
4) You can run a series of videos in the form of tutorials or informational videos on your
products. People are constantly looking for information online, so if you are providing
something relevant and up to date, then they will find you and make their way to your
website.
Social Media Marketing.
Social Marketing is the latest medium of online marketing and taps into a networking effect that
follows the viral or word of mouth marketing model. Social Media sites are frequented by millions of
daily users, and, love them or hate them, you have at your disposal a massive, connected audience.
Social sites including Facebook, Bebo and Myspace connect friends where they can share
information, text, photos and social events. Each member creates an account and builds their own
network of friends.
Network Effect.
The idea behind Facebook and the other social sites it to get millions of people connected, all
sharing information to the benefit of each individual user. The more people they can connect with
the more other people will want to join and the system becomes self sustaining and self fulfilling.
The power and value of Facebook increases by the number of friends it connects. This is called the
Network Effect.
176

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Cynics would say the model behind Facebook is not exactly to get users sharing information but with
the aim of getting as many users as possible into their database, because ultimately the more users
Facebook acquires the more marketing potential they have. However lets look at the potential for
your business to market to these networks and users.
How You Can Use Social Media?
To get started, create company accounts on Facebook and Twitter and begin to communicate with
potential buyers, but do not sell too early or aggressively in the business relationship.
This is an incredibly important and rapidly growing area of Internet marketing, allowing you to
promote yourself in a number of different social arenas. The significant thing to remember about
social media marketing is that you must be genuine to make a connection with other social users.
People are immune to spam, so there is no way you will stand out in a crowd unless you are offering
real and relevant information.
Facebook has 2 options. A Personal Profile where you connect with Friends and A Fan Page or
Business Page where you get Fans following you. You can create both if required or just choose
one profile. I have both a personal profile page and a business/fan page. I have subtle links from my
personal profile that link with my business/fan page and vice versa.
Twitter options. My recommendation is to use a service such as SocialOomph.com and link to your
Twitter account. From within the admin panel you can set up an automated email so when someone
follows you, a pre written email goes out with a welcome message and an offer such as a free report
or link to your website. You have 140 characters max so make your message short and sweet. Dont
set your account to auto follow anyone that follows you as automated systems follow and then
when you follow them, they unfollow you. Find people that you actually want to follow and are
interested in their Tweets. Also I uncheck the option to unfollow anyone that unfollows me,
simply because I may still want to follow someones Tweets, who cares if they unfollow me.
Some of the best social media and bookmarking sites are Facebook.com, Twitter.com and
MySpace.com.
There are Other Social Media Websites, such as:
Bebo.com
Digg.com
Flickr.com
LinkedIn.com (Professional Networking Site)
Reddit.com
Scribd.com
StumbleUpon.com
Technorati.com

E commerce Shopping Directories.
Shopping Directories and Comparison Shopping Websites have millions of products, thousands of
merchants and millions of impartial product reviews. They can help consumers to make informed
choices and, as a result, drive higher visitor to sales conversion rates on e commerce websites. They
can, if marketed rightagain watching the numbersoffer value to merchants.
As e commerce evolves, sellers and buyers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
adventurous, demanding more choice. Consumers want the widest range of products and stores to
compare prices and products, along with the information and data necessary to navigate and view
those products efficiently. Merchants can get immediate exposure to the ever expanding, global
population of online shoppers through Shopping Directories.
Here are the more popular Shopping Directories from the hundreds available online:
http://dir.yahoo.com/ (Yahoo Directory)
Bestoftheweb.com
Dealtime.com
Kelkoo.com
Dmoz.com (Open Directory Project)
PriceGrabber.com
Shopping.com
Shopzilla.com
Affiliate Marketing.
Affiliate Marketing is a simple concept. You offer affiliates the opportunity to promote your products
online, and they earn a set commission for every customer they send to your website who buys
from you. The sale must be completed in order to register as an affiliate sale. This can be a
percentage or set amount of the sale value.
The affiliates sales are all tracked using affiliate software that assigns a unique code to every
individual affiliate who signs up to promote your affiliate program. You (the merchant) are also
assigned a unique code that you installhidden in the codeon your order confirmation page.
To register an affiliate sale, a customer will click from the affiliates website or advert and their
unique code will be assigned to this customers path via cookies and tracked through to the
checkout confirmation page on your merchant website, where the affiliates code meets with your
merchant code and a sale is completed.
Think of an affiliate as being an independent sales rep. They do not get a salary; they simply make
commissions on any sales they send you.
178

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Pros: The pros to this are that you can get an army of affiliates/websites promoting your products,
potentially generating many incoming links back links that we know are essential for Off Site SEO.
Cons: The cons are that you may get lots of competitors and competing sites that can affect your
dominance and profits if you pay the affiliates too well.
It is important to Run the Numbers to Ensure there is Enough profit for You to:
a) Pay the affiliates their commission
b) Pay the affiliate network (if you use an affiliate network company to handle your account,
etc)
c) Take some money yourself from each sale.
You can choose to stipulate various conditions in your affiliate terms such as affiliates must not use
PPC ads to promote your affiliate program. You would enforce this if you want to dominate the PPC
space for your product. You can also determine the cookie length that is assigned to a prospects
tracking and registering as an affiliate sale, meaning they have a limited time to place the order once
they have clicked your affiliates link to your website. The average cookie length is 30 days.
The Flexibility of the Program Depends on Whether You Use your Own Software, or
Go through a Recognized Affiliate Network such as:
AffiliateFuture.co.uk
AffiliateWindow.com
Buy.at
CJ.com
ClickBooth.com
ClixGalore.com
LinkShare.com

Back End Marketing
Back end strategies are marketing methods for generating sales of additional products to
an existing customer database or email list. Back end marketing is critically important for long term
business growth and for the overall success of an e commerce sales and marketing strategy online.
Back end marketing is very inexpensive when compared to front end acquisition marketing as the
people you are marketing to are already your customers and you have their details. The largest
investment of money was already made in acquiring that customer on the front end.
A key advantage to back end marketing is that your response rates and conversions will be much
higher because your customers already know, respect and trust you.
Despite the benefits of back end marketinglow cost, higher conversions, higher profits, etc.its
the most underused and even ignored form of marketing strategy.
Email Newsletter.
One of the best ways to stay in contact with your new and existing customers and sell more products
is via a newsletter. This is critical for your e commerce business success as it keeps your customer
informed about new products, new services, and special offers and just keeps them in touch with
you in general.
When a customer gives you their email address having placed an order, they have legally opted in to
receive any mailings from you. However, you must have an Unsubscribe link in any emails you send
to them so they can opt out if they wish.
Your newsletter e mails can literally be about anything, but they should always give value. Word
them in a way to leave your customer wanting more, but do not sell aggressively from day one. Of
course, they should also relate to your products and market...
If you are selling guitars online and you have a database of customers who have bought guitars, then
you may want to add related guitar accessories or music products or even give away guitar tips and
techniques via email or a free PDF report. This concept will entice your customers to learn more, to
trust you, and to purchase more products when you offer them.
RSS.
RSS (Real Simple Syndication) is a way of delivering information from your website to your
prospects via an RSS Reader, which displays your content on their PC, Mac, Phone, Tablet, Slate or
PDA in an easy to view way.
Just like the newsletter strategy above, it is about building and maintaining relationships with your
customers and offering valuable information, special offer deals and related products.
An RSS can be applied to your blogs posts, blog comments, site content, podcasts, best sellers page
and new arrivals page. The idea is that when you add new content it is automatically sent to your
RSS subscribers reader delivering fresh new content.
180

www.ecommercegetitright.com
There is an option to synchronize your blog and newsletter in some of the big name email
newsletter software, so that when you post a blog it emails your newsletter list alerting them to the
new blog.
Personalization.
Personalization creates customer loyalty, builds trust and solidifies the relationship between your
customer and your business. More importantly, it increases sales.
Recommendation Systems.
Recommendation Engines or Recommendation Systems find customer patterns by studying your
past purchase history and make predications / recommendations based on this data. Essentially as a
merchant, they allow you to re decorate your store (website) for each individual customer based, on
their buying preferences. This would be impossible for a physical store.
Using Amazon.com as an example, they tailor their website product recommendations and e mails
to their customers. These recommendations appear everywhere across the site, from the home
page to product pages, and even on the order confirmation page. As these recommendations are
based exactly on your customers buying history, more sales will obviously result. Do the same and
watch as your sales and profits explode.
Finding Products.
Recommendation systems are critical because they help customers find products they want,
whereas on large e commerce websites they may never find products deep within product
categories.
Your customers want to know what you have to offer and what benefits you have for them. You have
heard the saying whats in it for me, so give them what they want. Give them recommendations,
display related items in their product search results and push related products on product pages, in
emails and all across the website when they are logged into their account and viewing your site.
Once you have this specific customer data, you can laser target and match your products to your
customers buying wants and desires, so they SPEND like crazy with you.
Areas of the website that can be Personalized:
Related Products block / You may also like block / or You might also be interested in block
Frequently Bought Together
Home Page
Products Pages
Best Sellers or Top Selling Products
New Products or New Arrivals
Order Confirmation page
Emails
181

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Email Personalization.
By personalizing contact you make with your customer you not only build a relationship and trust,
but you also increase your sales. Emailing and offering products based on your customers historical
buying data will laser focus your products and sales strategy.
Social Media.
Creating accounts on the top social sites such as Facebook and Twitter allows you to communicate
to your existing customers regularly and in real time, keeping your friends and followers in the loop.
You simply post comments on Facebook and tweet on Twitter about anything related to your
everyday business events, new offers and processes, subtly giving links to other interesting and
related things, but never taking your eye off the goal of building relationships to sell.
Feedback Loops.
Facebook pioneered status updates (known as Live feeds or News Feeds) on the internet, which
deliver content and information directly to your friends and followers in real time. Users no longer
have to go looking for your information and product updates: they are delivered automatically. As
soon as you post content, all of your connections (or friends) instantly receive this information,
allowing them to live life in a constant loop. Facebook and Twitter applies this constant action and
reaction to friendship and in your case to your business.
Real time updating and not necessarily the number of friends or followers you have, is the key for
maximizing business relationships. This model of constant status updates has now been used by
many social sites including Twitter.
Twitters online loop model is an imitation of Facebook but makes it simpler, yet it can be a more
powerful model for marketing for some. Tweets are simple, fast and instant.
As you only have 140 characters per tweet on Twitter, follow this tip
Use condensed links in your tweets from www.tinyurl.com
Or from http://bit.ly/
Social Comments & Tweets could be Anything Such As:
New Stock of 42 plasma TVs with free HDMI cable, just arrived
Unboxing of 200 iPad devices in progress, man do they look good
On way to CES show in Las Vegas to do deals on new DVD players
Uploaded new arrivals to website, some have 20% discounts
Testing new home cinema system that links your PC music with your TV
All of the above tweets can be followed by a link to the product or subject you are discussing and
are designed to intrigue and excite your followers into wanting the product you are hinting at.
182

www.ecommercegetitright.com
Existing Customer Loyalty / Discount Code.
When dispatching orders to new customers, try enclosing a loyalty discount code of 10%, 20% or
whatever your gross profit margin allows. This can be by email message or included in the box with
the customers orders. Use a business card size card to promote this or a paper flyer.
You can put an expiry date on the code to push your customers to order again by a certain date or
leave it open. The coupon code number itself could be Discount10 or Loyalty10 but use your
imagination to make the code number itself sound appealing. Using this strategy can increase orders
by up to 40% and all for the price of a free email or paper insert.
