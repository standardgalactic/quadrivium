About the Authors
Bud Smith grew up on the Left Coast and moved north — he 
couldn’t go much further west — to Silicon Valley 20 years ago 
to work for a technology startup. He’s an experienced technol­
ogy author, computer magazine editor, product manager, and 
marketer. He’s been writing about online communications since 
the early days of 14.4Kbps modems — about 1 percent of typical 
broadband speed today. His phones and other portable devices 
have included early Palms and BlackBerrys and worked for Apple 
when it introduced Newton, a distant ancestor of the iPhone he 
carries today. His books include Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 
now in its 9th Edition, and Marketing Online For Dummies. He 
holds a Master of Science degree in Information Systems from the 
London School of Economics. 
Chris Dannen grew up and works on the Right Coast and is cur­
rently based in New York City. His technology interests include 
a focus on telecommunications, and Chris has used and written 
about iPhones, BlackBerry phones, Android phones, and many 
others. Chris writes for a variety of technology magazines and 
Web sites, including Fast Company. He was an early adopter of 
GrandCentral, predecessor to Google Voice, using it to fend off — 
uh, that is, better communicate with — the legions of PR people 
that magazine editors are in constant communication with. He’s 
written two books about iPhone application development. He is 
completing a Master of Arts degree in journalism from Harvard 
University. 


Dedication
We would like to dedicate this book to our families, who have been 
endlessly supportive as we spent equally endless hours intently 
studying (okay, playing with) the latest and greatest phone tech­
nology in our quest to better understand Google Voice and its 
place in the future of telecommunications.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Katie Mohr and Tiffany Ma, our acquisitions editors, had the 
vision to support us in beginning this project within days of the 
announcement of Google Voice and the patience to see it through 
many changes and new developments to launch. Beth Taylor, our 
project editor, patiently shepherded the manuscript through revi­
sions and updates. Lynne Johnson, our technical editor, brought 
both depth and breadth of experience as well as a long-time 
Android fan’s perspective to our work. Mary Bednarek, executive 
acquisitions editor, lent help and encouragement at important 
junctures.

Foreword
A 
few years ago, we looked at all the phones in our own lives and discov­
ered things had become quite complicated: one for the office, another 
at home, a cell phone (maybe even two) for taking calls on the run. We had to 
remember a different number for each device, and so did our friends, family, 
and co-workers. We missed important calls whenever we stepped away from 
the desk or forgot a cell phone at home, and checking voicemail on all those 
phones proved more trouble than it was worth. We rarely listened to voice 
messages, and when we did, it was only to delete them.
The idea for GrandCentral, which later became Google Voice, was born out 
of our own frustrations. We worked on web-based technologies before and 
quickly realized the Internet could help everyone gain more control over 
their phones and communications. We eventually organized the product 
around a single phone number that links all of your phones together, a single 
voicemail box that is accessible from any of those phones with all of your 
messages saved online, and many features we all wished for, like voicemail 
transcription and a phone spam filter to keep unwanted callers away.
Today, the Google Voice team remains focused on making your communica­
tions better and we will continue developing new features that give you more 
control over how you communicate. We hope you enjoy exploring Google 
Voice through this book and thank you for using the service

Introduction
G
oogle Voice may be one of those rare trifectas — a product that’s truly 
new, truly important, and immediately recognized as such from the 
time it first appears. Why might this be?
Google Voice combines three of the most important trends of our time: the 
increasing power of our computers; the even faster-growing power of cell 
phones and smartphones; and the meteoric rise of Google to become the 
world’s leading Internet innovator.
Google Voice brings all this energy together in a product that’s free, easy 
to use, and available to anyone in the United States. If you have at least one 
phone and at least occasional access to a computer, then you can find immedi­
ate benefit in Google Voice. People with multiple phones and a lot of contacts — 
journalists, bloggers, salespeople, and savvy PR pros — are among the first 
to adopt it. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to follow.
Google Voice is simply a layer on top of the tools you already use, yet allows 
these tools to do much more than they did before. It’s still unknown, of 
course, just how much of a difference it will make over time, but its status as 
one of the most important new offerings of recent years has been acclaimed 
by newspapers, magazines, and the technorati alike.
But what about you, the new Google Voice user? Although it’s easy to get 
some superficial use out of Google Voice, it’s a deep product. To really take 
advantage of it means changing some existing habits and reorganizing the 
way you communicate. It also requires you to learn a few other new tools, 
such as dialer apps that run on smartphones. Luckily, all this work is likely to 
pay off handsomely. Effort you put into Google Voice today will pay off for a 
long time to come.
So enjoy the time you spend learning your way around Google Voice, and use 
this book to guide your experimentation with it. Google Voice is exciting and 
will change the world, at least a bit. You should have some fun as you learn 
to use it to its utmost capabilities.
About This Book
It’s about one of the most exciting products around — and it’s about 360 
pages long.

Google Voice For Dummies 
What do you find in these pages? The best and most in-depth guide to using 
Google Voice around. You learn how to thoroughly integrate Google Voice 
into your daily life and work. We show you how to use Google Voice along 
with the cell phones, land line phones, and computer(s) you already have 
and use every day, and how to shop for new gear that works best with your 
new Google Voice communication style.
We go beyond Google Voice itself to show you how it can best be used in 
organizations large and small, and how to get the most out of dialers that run 
on the leading smartphones from Apple, RIM BlackBerry, and manufacturers 
who use Google’s Android mobile operating system. We even discuss eti­
quette for the best use of Google Voice in your work and personal life.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve done our best to cram this book with information and insights, but 
almost no one will read it all the way through save our long-suffering editors. 
That’s because you are likely to discover some of the functionality of Google 
Voice on your own or from friends and colleagues before, during and after 
the time you spend reading this book.
You’re likely to need the chapter on one smartphone, but not all the chapters 
on all the smartphones we discuss. You may decide that you need to start 
with the chapter on Google Voice etiquette or that you never need it, and 
could have written a better guide to the topic yourself.
What do you need to use this book? A smartphone is enough, or a phone of 
any type and access to a computer. The more phones you’re responsible 
for — whether that’s just your own phones or also those of friends, family or 
coworkers — the more widely you’ll use what you learn here. Even a single 
phone, though, can be used better if you know how to get the most out of 
Google Voice in managing it.
You do need to be an experienced user of the Web and an experienced user 
of your phone so you can change settings. If you’re not super Web-savvy, 
don’t worry — we talk you through everything. This book can save you time 
and prevent common mistakes, but Google Voice isn’t rocket science.
	
The figures in this book show up-to-date Windows screen shots for a consistent 
appearance. Being Web-based, though, the instructions and steps in this book 
work equally well for Windows, the Macintosh, a netbook, or a smartphone — 
almost any device that can run a Web browser.

How This Book Is Organized
We began this book very soon after Google Voice was announced, before it 
was available to anyone outside Google and a few ladies and gentlemen of the 
press and early adopters. We finished it just a few months later, which is break­
neck speed for a major book project about such a new product. During that 
time some things in the real world and our understanding of how to get the 
most out of Google Voice both evolved.
So things changed along the way. And we began, and will continue to main­
tain, a blog at www.gvDaily.com to help describe and help you with any 
changes that occur after this book goes to print.

Google Voice For Dummies 
Part I: Setting up Google Voice
If you set up a mousetrap correctly, you end up minus a bit of cheese and 
plus a trapped mouse. It’s the same with Google Voice. If you make a strong 
beginning with it, you get results without a lot of additional effort. We devote 
Part I to showing you all the things that people who don’t have this book may 
trip over in setting up Google Voice.
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice
Google Voice has four layers of settings — for your phones, for individual 
callers, for groups of callers and for all callers as a whole. It can be controlled 
live from a phone before or during a call, from any Web-enabled phone, from 
a smartphone and from a Web browser. Getting the most out of all these set­
tings takes some doing, but don’t be intimidated. We make it easy for you to 
get the most out of Google Voice, and to save time and money as you do so.
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset
If you have a cell phone, no matter what kind it is, Google Voice will help you 
get the most out of it. We plumb the mysteries of the Google Voice Mobile site 
and Google Voice dialer apps for iPhone, Android phones, and BlackBerry 
phones to help you become a savvy, capable power user in very little time.
Part IV: Playing Well with Others
Google Voice works well with Gmail, other Google Apps offerings and even a 
third party tool, Gizmo5. It also “plays well” in small business and the enter­
prise. We show you how to get all these players operating as a team.
Part V: The Part of Tens
You only get one chance to make a first impression, and that’s as true in your 
use of Google Voice as it is anywhere else in life. Our Part of Tens chapters 
show you how to use the emerging etiquette for Google Voice to make it a 
positive for all those you come into contact with.

G
oogle Voice is a marvelous mashup — all the power and control we 
associate with computers at their best, combined with the warmth, 
spontaneity, and flexibility of talking to other people. Although you need to 
spend some time figuring out how to get the most out of Google Voice, the 
service can ultimately simplify your life.
Google Voice is not only powerful and capable in its own right, but it works 
alongside other Google services. You can get a lot out of it for personal use, 
and take it even further in a business context.
Google Voice is not to be confused with Google’s Voice Search, which allows 
you to search the Internet by speaking words out loud; nor with Google Talk, 
a service for using a computer directly for text messaging and computer-to-
computer voice conversations. Both of these are valuable services, but they 
don’t overlap with Google Voice, which allows you to fuse all your telephone 
lines into one central, Web-accessible hub.
Google Voice helps you manage real live phones, with all the voice quality 
and convenience that only a telephone has, along with voicemail for all of 
them. Unlike Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services, Google Voice lets 
you add the convenience of the Web while preserving the voice quality and 
convenience that only a telephone can offer.
And Google Voice saves you time, money, and hassle. Anyone can improve 
their life with Google Voice — while businesses can do even more, by cutting 
costs and adding services in a way that can not only reduce expenses, but 
really move the needle on what a business can offer customers.

Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Discovering Google Voice
Google Voice reduces the cost of calls, making national calls free and interna­
tional ones much cheaper — perhaps a tenth the cost of a direct-dialed cell 
phone call. And Google Voice notifies you of voicemail messages and allows 
you to record phone calls, so that you can manage conversations as well as 
the phones themselves.
Here’s how it works: Google Voice gives you a single, virtual phone number, 
from almost any area code in the U.S. that you’d like. That number, in turn, 
can ring any or all of your other phone lines — your work phone, cell phone, 
and so on, meaning that you can be reached with just one number.
Google Voice also changes the way you can handle calls. Like any phone 
service, it records voicemail messages. And it sends you notification that a 
voicemail message is waiting.
You can also screen callers and listen in on voicemail messages before deciding 
whether to pick up the call, just like an old-fashioned answering machine. And 
it lets you block callers, send certain numbers straight to voicemail, and set up 
custom mailbox greetings for discrete callers. You can record calls on the fly, 
send and receive SMS text messages, and keep your entire call history online.
All of these capabilities were part of GrandCentral, the service that Google 
bought in 2007 and made the foundation for Google Voice. Google Voice adds 
several new capabilities.
One is support for text messaging, or SMS, from your GrandCentral phone 
number. This feature was missing in GrandCentral but is added in Google 
Voice, making the service much more seamless to use. Figure 1-1 shows the 
SMS interface, new with Google Voice.
A wonderful bonus, though, is very inexpensive international calls — a few 
cents a minute to most countries, instead of ten or more cents, or even the 
better part of a dollar, per minute from different land line and cell phone plans.
But it also allows you to access your voicemail messages and listen to them 
online. You can forward a message to a friend or embed it in a Web site. Most 
amazingly, Google Voice transcribes your voicemail messages instantly — 
not perfectly, but surprisingly well, in most cases — so that you can read them 
on-screen, in your e-mail inbox, or as a text message. So if you’re staying in touch 
by e-mail, as more and more people do these days, you don’t have to leave text 
mode to stay in touch with, manage, and respond to your voice messages.
Google Voice also supports conference calls and call merging, so you can 
easily (and cheaply) plan a conference call. You can also spontaneously 
expand a typical two-person call to include more people. This is a major 
improvement for all of us who have not been able to make a conference call

happen when we badly needed one. Google Voice also lets you switch an 
incoming call from one phone to another without hanging up and redialing 
and to record part or all of an incoming call.
	
Figure 1-1:

you from

SMS of

Google Voice is potentially useful for anyone, but it offers an additional level 
of ease and utility when used with a smartphone. Google Voice-specific 
applications are also already available for iPhone and Google Android.
There’s much more, as we describe throughout this book. But you can 
already see that Google Voice can make a big difference in how — and how 
effectively — you can use your phones.
Waking Up with Google Voice
Let’s begin with a typical workday as it might unfold for you using Google Voice. 
Google Voice makes you more capable and accessible with regard to work, yet at 
the same time better able to protect your personal life and personal time.
Even if you don’t work, much of the following applies to attending school, 
volunteering, keeping up with friends — anything that you do in groups. (And 
all things that you have more time for if you’re not working.)
It’s 6:20 a.m., and 10 minutes before your alarm goes off, your cell phone rings. 
Normally you would have no choice but to answer — what if it’s important?

12
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
But with Google Voice in place, you know that the person must be important 
if the phone is even ringing, because you’ve sent all nonessential callers 
straight to voicemail for the night. Still, you let the call ring through to voice­
mail. It gets picked up by Google Voice, and you listen in to the message as 
it is being left. You hear that it’s a message from a work colleague about the 
commute being crowded — something you need to know, but not a call you 
absolutely have to answer.
You’re in control. In this case, you pick up the call as the message is finish­
ing up so that you can thank your friend. But you could have just let it go if 
you wanted. You have the information you needed, and your blood pressure 
stayed low throughout.
You get up and get ready for work quickly. As you shower and eat your 
breakfast, you turn off the ringer on your cell phone, but both e-mail and 
voicemail messages show up onscreen in your e-mail inbox. (Figure 1-2 shows 
a transcribed voicemail message in Google Voice.) So you can glance at any 
messages shortly after they come in and respond to anything urgent.
You’ve planned a quick call to an overseas colleague before you leave for 
work, catching them at the end of their workday. In the past, you might 
have had to get to the office extra early to place the call, because it would 
be cheaper to make and appear on your employer’s bill, not yours. But with 
Google Voice, the call is so cheap that you can make a quick call without 
worrying about the cost.
What were they thinking?
The Google Voice story starts with a company 
called Dialpad. Dialpad was a voice-over-IP 
(VOIP) pioneer, offering free phone calls over 
PCs. After crashing in the dot-com bust in 2001, 
Dialpad got new management — including Craig 
Walker and Vincent Paquet, later the co-found­
ers of GrandCentral. The new management team 
made the company profitable and helped sell it 
off to Yahoo!, who used it as the core of their 
Yahoo! Voice offering, launched in 2005.
The key inspiration behind GrandCentral was the 
realization that the same technology that could 
help in making cheap calls could be used for call 
services as well. The key technical innovation 
in Google Voice is a soft switch — a telephone 
call switch, like an old-fashioned switchboard 
but built in software. The services offered first 
by GrandCentral, and now by Google Voice, are 
largely applications running on the soft switch.
Yet the “secret sauce” of GrandCentral, and 
now of Google Voice, is only partly capability. 
The other part is simplicity. As first implemented 
by the GrandCentral team, and cleaned up and 
improved with help from Google, Google Voice 
has one of the cleanest, simplest, most attrac­
tive, and easiest to use interfaces one could 
imagine for such powerful software. It took 
considerable self-discipline on the part of the 
development teams to make Google Voice so 
easy to use.

 Chapter 1: A Day in Your Google Voice Life
	
Figure 1-2: 
Google 
Voice takes 
a message 
for you.
	
You call into Google Voice from your home phone instead of your cell phone, 
because the cellular connection can get a bit weak where you live. Then you 
dial through to your colleagues, at just a few cents a minute, and get through 
your business. But the call goes a bit long and you switch it to your cell 
phone, without interruption, to say your goodbyes as you grab your coat and 
head out the door toward work.
At Work with Google Voice
On the drive to work, you dutifully wear your hands-free headset and listen 
as a couple of calls come in, but you don’t answer; you just listen to the 
messages being left, knowing you can cut in if you have to, but otherwise 
deferring most of your responses until you get to the office. You’re less tense 
than usual, because the ringing of the phone doesn’t compel an immediate 
response on your part.
You get to the office on time. At work, you open the two e-mailed voice mes­
sage transcriptions from Google Voice and send e-mails in response. Before 
a meeting, you open up Google Voice on your computer and block your 
personal contacts, sending their calls to voicemail (supported, of course, by 
e-mail transcriptions, so you can respond if anything urgent comes up).
At work, you receive an important call on your Google Voice number and 
then use Google Voice to record part of it. Google Voice automatically 

14
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
notifies the other party with a verbal message. You’re able to concentrate 
fully on the call, with no need to take notes as a record. At the end of the call, 
you easily conference in your boss, despite that she is on the road, to add a 
few final words.
After the call is over, you forward the recording to the other party by e-mail 
(a practice that takes any possible tinge of rudeness out of recording some­
one on the phone). You then embed the recording in a blog post in your com­
pany’s internal blog, so others can listen to and learn from it.
Throughout the day, you and your colleagues use Google Voice to flexibly 
manage calling groups for calls to individuals who are away from their desks 
or to the department as a whole. Many routine calls from vendors are auto­
matically routed to voicemail or to other associates.
With Google Voice, it’s much less important to be at your desk. Calls to your 
Google Voice number can go to both your desk phone and your cell phone, 
so you can use whichever one is handier. When you are away from your desk, 
a smartphone interface allows you to make and manage calls easily through 
the company’s Google Voice account, saving you hassle and the company a 
lot of money while keeping control. Figure 1-3 shows an Android interface for 
Google Voice of a type that many organizations are likely to be using.
	
Figure 1-3: 
Use Google 
Voice to put 
home on the 
back burner 
for a while.
	
Whether at your desk or on the move, using the phone in a conference room 
or your cell phone, you no longer need to worry over the cost of long calls 
to faraway colleagues. For international calls, you only pay a few cents per 

15
 Chapter 1: A Day in Your Google Voice Life
minute. And you pay the same rates on your cell phone — which is more con­
venient, but uses minutes from your plan — or from a desk phone. You can 
even use any handy land line without worrying that you’re putting charges on 
someone else’s bill.
Relaxing at Home with Google Voice
At home, the most exciting thing that Google Voice makes possible is what 
doesn’t happen.
You don’t get any nasty surprises on your home phone voicemail that you 
missed a package delivery, or missed a plumber’s appointment, or missed 
your last chance to pay your credit card bill without a penalty. You’ve 
received any such voicemail messages during the day, as both e-mail tran­
scripts and as actual voice messages you can pick up from any Web browser 
or phone. And you’ve been able to deal with any occasional mini-crisis before 
it becomes a real one.
You don’t get any calls during dinner, whether by yourself or with your 
family, because you can block all calls and leave a message that you’d be 
available later that evening. Figure 1-4 shows the Google Voice screen you 
use to make this happen quickly.
	
Figure 1-4:

Voice to 
protect 
“home” 
from 
“phone” for 
a while.
	

16
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
And you don’t get any sales calls, ever, because numbers from unknown callers 
don’t ring your home phone anymore. They get sent straight to Google Voice’s 
voicemail-with-e-mail-notification, so you can respond to any calls you actually 
want within a reasonable time and never have to bother with the rest. (Or, leave 
your phone open to calls but rely on Google Voice’s telemarketer database to 
screen out the vast majority of sales calls.)
By using Google Voice, you can go to bed early without the phone ringing, 
watch a movie without interruption, or stay up late making cheap, Google 
Voice-enabled calls to friends, family members or work colleagues in various 
time zones around the world.
Grasping the Bottom Line
In the next few chapters, we show you how to get the most out of Google 
Voice. Managing phones from a computer interface is new to everyone, so 
there’s going to be some cogitation involved, and it may take some practice.
So it’s worth reflecting a bit on the benefits that Google Voice brings as inspi­
ration for the effort you need to put in to really master it and make it your 
friend.
Saving time and reducing stress
With Google Voice, your phones ring less. Until Google Voice, your phones 
owned you — the very first ring of a phone was something you had to deal with 
right then and there. But Google Voice gives you so much control: allowing you 
to block calls, let a call roll through to voicemail — then answer it if needed — 
and more. Your phone rings less, and you’re in control when it does.
Most of the early adopters of Google Voice are likely to be people with lots of 
phones to worry about. Google Voice cuts down on the relay game you play 
with friends and family. But its stress-reducing qualities shine through even 
if you only have a single landline phone plopped in the middle of your living 
room (or, as more and more people do, a single cell phone always near you).
How does it really save time, though? It’s a question of attention. Before, 
each call and voicemail message commanded the same amount of attention, 
because you never knew the content of the call in advance. Now you can pri­
oritize calls and voicemails the same way you do other forms of communica­
tion, such as e-mail and printed mail, which you can judge by a brief glance. 
That’s why people have switched so much of their communications to e-mail 

17
 Chapter 1: A Day in Your Google Voice Life
from the phone; it’s easier for our brains to filter by reading than by listening. 
Google Voice allows the achievement of a happy medium between e-mail-
centric and voice-centric communication, each of which has its advantages.
Saving money
Today, overseas calls can cost several dollars even for a few minutes, especially 
from your cell phone. Even long-distance U.S. calls can add up. You either have 
to force a call to be shorter than it should be, or grin and bear the cost.
Conference calls are hard to set up, subject to hard and fast trunk line avail­
ability and time limits, and often very expensive indeed.
Calls home to loved ones while on a business trip can be very expensive, 
either burning a hole in your pocket or prompting quizzical questions from 
your boss — or his or her boss. And juggling time zones against access to 
cheaper calling opportunities is a nightmare.
Skype, Google Talk, and similar computer-supported calling services have 
made a dent in phone costs. But they lack the call quality and reliability of 
landline phones and the flexibility of mobile phones. Privacy is harder as 
well. (How many intensely private phone calls get made in Internet cafes and 
other public places to save money?)
Google Voice really gives you the best of the computer and the phone. You 
can make calls where you want to, when you want to, with exponentially less 
worry about cost. This aspect of Google Voice will improve many people’s lives.
Gaining control
“Power to the people” was a popular theme of the flower children back in the 
1960s. Google Voice, like a lot of other Internet-based technology, makes it a 
reality.
Although getting a grasp on all of the features takes some work, it’s also 
really cool to be able to control what happens with your phones. And, 
beyond the personal level, it’s even cooler to be able to control how groups 
of phones interact with groups of people. A few years ago, there was a lot of 
talk about PDAs — Personal Digital Assistants. Google Voice makes not only 
your own phones, but all the phones around you into little helpers that can 
accept some calls and push off the rest to another phone or voicemail (with 
e-mail accompaniment).

18
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
It may take years for the practice of phone management through Google Voice 
to catch up with so much that’s new — the possibilities that Google Voice itself, 
smart phone interfaces, other add-on products and future improvements in all 
of the above will make possible. Some of Google Voice’s capabilities and cost 
savings are likely to work their way into competing products as well, so the 
environment will change for everyone, Google Voice users or not. But the end 
result will be phones that do what people want them to do, rather than phones 
that make people do unneeded work.
Google Voice is going to change the way you and everyone else uses phones. 
So you’ve made a smart choice by adopting Google Voice, and by investing 
in this book to get the most out of it. You can start getting the benefits right 
away — you can save hassle, time, and money, while gaining control and 
getting out in front of a technology that may change all our lives.

G
oogle Voice can change how you live. But that’s only if you let it, by 
integrating Google Voice with the phone numbers and phones you 
already have.
When you first sign up for Google Voice, you select a new phone number with 
an area code originating in the state and area of your choosing. Then you can 
give out your new number and try to get people to start calling you on that 
one instead of your cell phone number and your other numbers.
However, getting people to change their habits is really hard. People tend to 
keep using your other numbers, evading your fancy new Google Voice setup 
(At least, not without some tricks, which we describe later in this chapter.)
Another reason why making this happen is difficult is that people — especially 
cell phone users — tend to call you back on the number you called them 
from. So even if they have your Google Voice number in their phone list, 
when you call them from, say, your home phone, they call you back on the 
same number — bypassing Google Voice.
But the whole secret of Google Voice is to have one number (your Google 
Voice number) that you control from a PC or smartphone, so in this book we 
let you in on how to use it most extensively. You don’t really get much out of 
Google Voice unless people call you on your Google Voice number, or unless 
you forward various phones to Google Voice.
We also tell you how to arrange things so that you save a ton of money on 
your calls and get all the features and convenience of Google Voice, all the 
time — even if you already started using Google Voice the easy-seeming way. 
The key trick is to assign your cell phone number to Google Voice.

20
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Assigning Your Cell Phone 
Number to Google Voice
So here’s a change in your life: assign your cell phone number to Google 
Voice. Doing so removes the existing number from your cell phone, so you 
then have to get a new SIM and a new number for the phone itself.
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, this capability is being hinted at 
and not yet offered. If it is on offer, seriously consider taking advantage of it, 
as described here. If not, see the steps in the next section for adding a new 
Google Voice number.
The No. 1 complaint people had about GrandCentral, the precursor to 
Google Voice, was that they couldn’t assign their cell phone number as their 
GrandCentral number.
	
If you are able to assign your cell phone number to Google Voice, you pull 
a rather neat bait and switch. People think they’re calling you on your cell 
phone, which means direct access to you wherever you happen to be. But 
really, they’re calling Google Voice, which you can use to shield yourself from 
and manage incoming calls.
Figure 2-1 shows the before and after of how your cell phone works, before 
and after you assign your cell phone number to Google Voice.

USING YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER AS YOUR GOOGLE VOICE NUMBER

You can assign your cell phone number to Google Voice even if you already 
have a GrandCentral or Google Voice account with its own phone number. 
Just create a new Google Voice account and assign your cell phone number to 
it. Then change the voicemail message on your old account to give your new 
number. You’ll still get voicemail notifications e-mailed to you from the old 
account. You’ll need to check for SMS text messages in the old account during 
any transition period.
	
Don’t keep too many Google Voice accounts over time, as the unused ghost 
account is potentially confusing to you and your callers. You should only keep 
an account if you’re getting real value out of it. So if you stop using a Google 
Voice account, don’t just permanently forward to a new account and forget. 
Create a plan to migrate people off the unused number and then delete it 
within a month or two.
If you get a new Google Voice number (it will cost $10 to change your Google 
Voice numbers, unless you are starting a new account) instead of assigning 
your cell phone number to Google Voice, a lot of people will still have (and 
call you on) your cell phone number. It will be tempting to return calls and 
texts to them directly from your cell phone, without dialing through Google 
Voice, perpetuating the problem. You can only fully move onto Google Voice 
with a determined effort.
Getting a New Number 
from Google Voice
You may decide to do things the easy way (easy at first, anyway) and get a 
new phone number from Google Voice. Or, if the ability to move your cell 
phone number to Google Voice has not yet become available, you may have 

22
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
no choice. The following sections go over a few tips for handling a brand new 
Google Voice phone number.
Choosing an area code
If you choose a number from Google Voice, you have a choice of area codes 
to use. People sometimes end up regretting the choice they make.
(You may face the same decision as to what area code you want if you buy a 
new cell phone or SIM. Don’t think people won’t drive a few miles or use mail 
order or online order to get a more desirable area code for their “cell”!)
Area codes were stable for a long time, and your area code used to give people 
a good idea of where you were from. As population, and the number of phone 
numbers per person grew, the U.S. split into more and more different area 
codes. San Diego County, for example, had one area code as recently as 25 
years ago; now it has four. Los Angeles, which had three, now has 15! (See 
Figure 2-2 for a map.)
/www.nanpa.com/area_code_maps/display.html?cainset2
	
Figure 2-2: 
Los Angeles 
is up to 15 
area codes.
	

23
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
Mobile phones have complicated the picture further, because many people 
keep the same mobile phone number even when they move (or after area 
code boundaries shift, moving their home and/or office phone into a new 
area code). And some areas have overlays, where older phone lines have one 
area code and newer phone lines have another.
So now, if you choose a Google Voice number when signing up, you have a 
difficult choice to make, if you live and work in different area codes. (With 
your mobile phone having either or perhaps yet a different one.) Which area 
code should you use for your Google Voice number?
Three issues are involved:
	
✓	Ease of dialing from a landline: People outside your chosen area code 
have to dial the extra digits for a different area code. (Your mobile 
phone callers will presumably use some kind of contacts list or speed 
dialing capability.)
	
✓	The potential cost to your callers: The cost issue is getting smaller 
because more and more people have free statewide or even, as with 
Google Voice, free national calling.
	
✓	The coolness factor: You might live in La Jolla, with the cool 858 area 
code that encompasses some desirable beach areas, but work in San 
Diego, with the blobby 619 area code that covers most of the rest of 
the city. Or you might even work in Escondido, part of the immense 760 
code that includes most of California’s inland desert. Which area code 
do you choose?
	
We can help you simplify the ease of dialing and cost issues. Who most often 
calls you from a landline phone? That’s where ease of dialing matters, and 
often cost too, as landline phones don’t have as many plan options and are 
less likely to dial through Google Voice.
And, who most often calls you on their own dime? (As the saying goes, even 
though pay phone calls now cost a lot more than a dime.)
These callers are likely to be your family and close friends. So you might 
want to consider using the same Google Voice area code as they do, if they’re 
somewhere near your home and/or work.
Consider your own needs as well. If you’ll be using landlines to dial into 
Google Voice (which gets you better call quality and more comfort and 
avoids using cell phone minutes), you’ll want a number that’s likely to be free 
from whatever land lines you’re most frequently near.
In this case you may want to use the area code for where you work, rather 
than where you live, especially if the vast majority of your calls are going 
to be from work or from people calling in the area code where your work is 
located.

And for business purposes, you may want to get a Google Voice number in an 
area code that covers an area you want to expand to.
Using your new Google Voice number
Some of your friends and family may have several numbers for you, and call 
you at work some of the time, and on your mobile or at home — 
basically guessing where you are and leaving redundant voicemails.
This can be a hassle for you, especially if you’re deliberately not picking up the 
call. Many of us have had the experience of having the desk phone ring at our 
job, ignored it, and then heard our cell phone ring with the same person trying 
again. This is especially annoying if you’re having a conversation at the time.
So you want to get people to use your Google Voice number so that you can 
take full advantage of it. The best way is to leave messages on all your real 
phones asking people to call you on your new number instead. Then, be 
tough and only pick up on calls to your real phones that are coming to you 
through Google Voice.
The alternative is to use your Google Voice number as an additional number, 
a shield for less-wanted calls, and for cheap long-distance, international, and 
conference calling, as discussed in Chapter 7.
Using the new number as a secondary number was popular for GrandCentral 
numbers, back before Google Voice took over, because GrandCentral didn’t 
have as many features. Also, the GrandCentral Web site was Flash-based, 
meaning it didn’t work on many cell phones. GrandCentral also lacked dialers 
for mobile phones.
Most people found it too hard to fully convert people to the new number. Also, 
GrandCentral simply discarded SMS messages to a GrandCentral number, so 
people kept using their cell phones, with the GrandCentral number as an 
alternative.
Part of the reason GrandCentral got such great reviews, and Google Voice got 
such good early reviews as well, is that this kind of usage for Google Voice 
was perfect for media people — reporters and reviewers. Such people have 
a lot of casual contacts that they need to be in touch with some of the time, 
and to shield themselves from most of the time. GrandCentral kept users’ real 
phone numbers private, and the e-mail alerts for voicemails were convenient, 
too. All this helped GrandCentral get strong early reviews and laid a good 
foundation for Google Voice with the journalistic community as well.

 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
Saving Money on Your Cell Phone Bill
	
You can save money on your cell phone bill two ways: by switching to a less 
robust plan and by reducing the extras on your bill.
Here are the two main things you pay for on your cell phone plan and how to 
cut them with Google Voice:
	
✓	Minutes: You’re paying for minutes of using your cell phone each 
month. With Google Voice, you can switch an incoming call to a nearby 
land line handset that’s one of your verified Google Voice phones — as 
explained in the next chapter — by pressing * at any point during the 
call. All your Google Voice phones will ring; pick up the nearby landline 
hand set and continue the call.
	
	For outgoing calls, you can still use a land line hand set, but you have 
to dial Google Voice from the handset, and then dial the destination 
number as well. You can use your cell phone for looking up the number 
you need, but you still have to dial a bunch of digits.
	
✓	Texts: You can send texts from Google Voice using the Web interface or 
using a dialer program on your cell phone with no impact on your bill. 
You still pay for texts you receive because they’ll be forwarded through 
to your cell phone.
The extras, both planned and unplanned, can multiply your bill several times 
over. Trim your bills by trying out the following tips with Google Voice:
	
✓	Making phone calls to other countries: Google Voice cuts the cost of 
these calls to pennies a minute — 2¢a minute to China or landlines in 
France, for example. If you make the call from your cell phone, you’re 
still using cell phone minutes, but you can avoid calls that can total hun­
dreds of dollars in a month with this feature. You can also cut out bolt-
ons on your bill, where you pay a set fee up front for cheaper access to 
specific countries.
	
✓	Making phone calls while in another country: Google Voice will not 
make your cell phone ring while you’re in another country. Much of the 
time, this is a good thing, because it avoids all sorts of costs and time 
zone hassles; you control costs by always initiating the call. When you 
call Google Voice to initiate or manage calls from your cell, it’s a roam­
ing call back to a U.S. number, so you want to keep your minutes down.
	
	You may find that you need to give out your real cell phone number to 
some people so they can reach you immediately, which undermines 
your use of your Google Voice number. Alternatively, you can pick up a 
cheap, pay as you go SIM or cell phone while you’re in-country. (These 
are common in other countries, though rare in America.) Doing this 
saves you money on in-country calls and gives you a number that can be 
rung from anywhere.

26
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
Brief your U.S. friends and colleagues about the time zone difference before 
you travel to avoid those painful middle-of-the-night phone calls.
We describe how to use Google Voice with VOIP services that can save you 
more money on top of what Google Voice saves you, in Chapter 15.
You may well be on a 12-month or 18-month cell phone plan, perhaps as part 
of the deal that got you a free phone. You have to keep paying the minimum 
you agreed to, even though you may not be using all of your included allow­
ances. When the time period of the plan runs out, you can switch to a lower-
use or pay as you go plan.
The only problem here is that lots of people get their phones for free, or 
highly discounted, along with a robust cell phone plan with a lot of minutes 
and text messages included. The package of a free or discounted phone and 
a relatively expensive plan does cost you money; however, the cost is well 
hidden. To use Google Voice, you want a robust smartphone so that you can 
run the best dialers and Google Voice’s mobile Web interface, but you must 
pay for it directly if it’s not built into a plan.
	
If you consistently underuse your cell phone minutes and text allowance once 
you switch to Google Voice, consider a pay-as-you-go-plan. Look for one that 
auto-recharges from your credit card or bank account, so you never run out of 
minutes (which is unacceptably embarrassing on a business call).
At least one major provider now offers free Wi-Fi calling; calls are free if your 
phone can get a Wi-Fi connection. (Wi-Fi calling is good in many homes and 
offices; not so good in places where you have to pay by the hour for Wi-Fi, 
then may not reach the party you’re dialing!)
If you use Wi-Fi calling, it will almost certainly cut your use of minutes and 
text, but perhaps in unpredictable ways. Consider a pay as you go plan with 
the Wi-Fi calling feature, if the combination is available.
One if by land
Landline phones have several advantages 
when used with Google Voice:
	✓	The landline phone is likely to have unlim­
ited free local calling minutes, even on low-
cost plans, so your calls to a local Google 
Voice number are free.
	✓	No problems with getting a signal.
	✓	No running down your cell phone battery.
	✓	Usually, better voice quality.
	✓	Often, more comfortable handsets.
The combination of these features makes long 
calls in particular much easier and worry-free.

27
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
	
Keep an eye open for good deals on cell phones with pay-as-you-go deals. 
Special deals with pay-as-you-go will be how you get phones going forward. 
This new dispensation should boost Google Android phones, which may be 
able to offer the ultimate in integration with Google Voice.
Getting a New Cell Phone 
for Google Voice
Sooner or later, you may want to get a new cell phone that can help you get 
the most out of Google Voice.
To use Google Voice, you probably want a smartphone — a phone with a big 
screen that can do a lot, including surfing the Web, getting e-mail, and playing 
back your Google Voice voicemail messages.
Web capability allows you to use the special mobile version of the Google 
Voice Web page to manage Google Voice. (There’s still some work to do for 
Google here – it’s not as cool as the Gmail mobile Web page or Gmail appli­
cation on various smartphones.) And e-mail capability allows you to conve­
niently view the voicemail transcriptions that Google Voice sends you.
You can also use a non-smart cell phone and do all your Google Voice and 
e-mail management from your computer, in which case just about any phone 
will do.
But if you do go the smartphone route, what do you want in a cell phone to 
use with Google Voice? Look for a few key items:
	
✓	Big screen: The Google Voice Web page works best, and you can see 
more of your e-mail call transcriptions on a big, high-resolution screen.
	
✓	Good keyboard: Google Voice now fully supports text messaging, and 
you also want to receive and possibly reply to voicemail transcriptions 
on your mobile phone. So you should feel comfortable typing entire sen­
tences on your new phone.
	
✓	A strong Google Voice dialer application: You can just use one dialer 
program, but the more there are for your phone, the more likely you are 
to find a really good one.
	
✓	Touch screen: Maybe. For some people, doing more with a cell phone 
means that a touch screen, especially a multi-touch screen that recog­
nizes gestures, is all the more valuable. For others, it’s an unneeded 
extra. Try it and decide for yourself.

28
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Table 2-1 lists major types of mobile phones and the screen size and resolu­
tion, keyboard type and number of dialer apps for Google Voice. We ordered 
the list by the area of the screen, which is the most important stat for how 
good a Web browsing or e-mail reading experience you will have. (Using Web 
pages on a smartphone has been compared to looking into a room through a 
keyhole. It helps to have the biggest keyhole you can get!)
	
As mentioned, the list of phones is ordered by the area of the screen. (The res­
olution, in dots per inch, is important too but is similar for all these screens, 
about 160dpi.) Note that the diagonal measurement of a screen is a bit decep­
tive; a cut of only about 10 percent in the diagonal measurement, from 3.5 
inches on the iPhone 3G to 3.2 inches on the BlackBerry Storm, results in a 
drop of nearly 20 percent in the screen area, from 6 square inches on the 
iPhone to 4.9 square inches on the BlackBerry Storm.
For a competing phone — or, perhaps, a possible future offering from Apple — 
to offer something comparable to an iPhone-type experience, it needs to have 
a screen with a diagonal measurement not very much less than 3.5 inches.
	
Of course, this list will quickly go out of date, but it gives you an idea of the 
options that were out there around the time that Google Voice was introduced, 
in mid-2009.

 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
We haven’t seen any statistics yet, but our anecdotal impression is that the 
iPhone has the lead as a Google Voice tool in the early running. It seems 
that iPhone had the most share among GrandCentral users and among 
people who got an early Google Voice account as well. iPhone users are also 
big users of Google search, Google Voice Search, and other Google apps.
Many of these people have multiple cell phones, such as a BlackBerry for 
work and an iPhone for personal use, but the iPhone is what they pull out 
to impress people. And the iPhone has the key feature needed to get the 
most out of Google Voice: a big screen. In fact, the biggest screen, by a good 
margin, of any leading phone. Unfortunately, the only choice iPhone users 
have at this writing is the Google Voice mobile Web site. (See the sidebar 
“Apple and Google Voice dialers” for details.)
BlackBerry smartphones tend to have smaller screens, although the 
Blackberry Storm has an only slightly smaller (about 20 percent less area), 
and slightly higher-resolution screen than the iPhone. It also, like the iPhone 
but unlike other BlackBerry smartphones, lacks a physical keyboard.
BlackBerry phones are more often issued by big organizations, and as such 
are less likely to have their numbers assigned to Google Voice. As mentioned 
above, it’s not uncommon for people to have both an iPhone, for personal 
use, and a BlackBerry that gets used more for e-mail than anything. It will 
be interesting to see how these two-phone users integrate Google Voice into 
their lives.
The most potential for Google Voice seems to be with the Google Android 
phones, with the parent company is the same as for Google Voice. These 
phones meet the key needs any Google Voice user has: a great smartphone 
with a fully integrated dialer, so no extra steps at all for calling, receiving, or 
managing calls or SMS text messages.
We look into how to use major Google Voice dialers in Part III. But if you’re 
thinking about a new cell phone, think about how you’re going to use it with 
Google Voice as you make the call (uh, the decision, that is).
Apple and Google Voice dialers
In a controversial move, Apple pulled existing 
Google Voice apps from the App Store and denied 
Google’s application for a new app in August 
2009. The Federal Communications Commission 
has officially inquired into the reasons.
It’s unknown what will happen going forward: 
whether the existing apps may be restored 
or whether Google’s free dialer, which would 
pretty much put the existing apps out of busi­
ness, will be approved. We have coverage of 
Google’s free dialer in Chapter 12 and Chapter 
13, and have retained coverage of the other 
apps in Chapter 11.

Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Handling Your Home Phone
With people so often out of the house during the day, managing one’s 
home phone is one of the toughest tasks in modern life. In some homes, the 
landline doesn’t get used much, except for those sales calls that still sneak 
through. Yet in other phones the land line is used frequently. Many young 
people don’t have land line phones at all.
Those of us who do have a landline phone can sympathize. Having the phone 
ring in the middle of the night is one of the small nightmares of modern life. 
Having dinners, baths, conversations, and naps interrupted by the phone is 
one of the great hassles — a source of both humor and frustration.
If you are among the majority who still do have a home phone number, here’s 
a suggestion: forward it to Google Voice, much or all of the time. That way 
you can manage calls, get voicemail transcriptions, screen out sales calls and 
on and on.
Forwarding your landline may require you to pay for forwarding capability 
through your phone company or by buying a new landline phone. Once you 
do this, though, you get a lot of control. And a lot of power. With a landline 
phone used with Google Voice, you can pay very little for phone service that 
includes free local calls and not much else. This gives you a phone with excel­
lent reception and call quality, no worries about keeping the phone charged, 
and, often, more comfortable handsets. Google Voice gives you everything 
else you need.
	
If you forward a phone, such as a landline phone, to Google Voice, as we 
suggest, you can’t then forward calls from Google Voice to that phone. You 
can still call Google Voice from it for outgoing calls, though.
	
Instead of forwarding your home phone number, there’s a similar method for 
accomplishing the same goal, especially useful for homes with several people 
in them: turn off the ringer on your home phone (a hammer may help) and 
leave a message on your answering machine or answering service giving an 
individual number for each person in your home. This will quickly train people 
away from using your home phone number, without disabling it completely. 
(Except for whatever part you’ve hit with a hammer.)
Handling Work Phones
If you work for someone else, you’re likely to have a desk phone with a direct 
dial number, an internal extension number, or both. You may or may not 
have someone to answer the phone for you if you’re not there, but even if 
you do, they’re unlikely to be on duty all the times that you’re at work.

31
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
In many organizations, you may also have a work-issued cell phone. Your 
work-issued cell phone may be locked down (intended to be used in a pre­
scribed way, no changes desired, or perhaps not even allowed). Or you 
may be expected to use your personal cell phone for work purposes when 
required.
In these cases, the only way you can use Google Voice is to forward your 
work phone number(s) to your personal Google Voice account when you’re 
away from your desk or don’t wish to be disturbed and want the voicemail 
messages to go someplace where they’re easier to manage. (This is different 
from assigning your work phone number to Google Voice, which may not be 
possible: Google Voice doesn’t work with extension phones.) Check poli­
cies at your office; organizations can be expected to try to get on top of this 
quickly. Also, experiment to see whether you can assign your work phone 
number to Google Voice if you so desire (and if your employer’s policies 
allow it; see the next paragraph).
	
If you’re employed by someone else, forwarding your phone to Google Voice 
may be okay, but you really shouldn’t give out your Google Voice number as 
your work phone number without explicit permission. Doing so can interfere 
with your employer’s procedures for managing phones and phone calls — and 
will interfere with you, too, when you change jobs. Finding out that you’ve 
used a Google Voice account as your work phone number could cause the 
head of your CIO (Chief Information Officer) to implode!
Here’s an example of the problems such a step could cause: Using your 
Google Voice number as a work number may help you poach clients from 
your old employer. Even this specific example doesn’t sum up the whole prob­
lem; large organizations spend a good deal of time on issues of governance and 
control that specifically exclude things like an individual (such as you) routing 
business calls through an outside company (such as Google).
Creating a Google Account
Before you set up Google Voice, you need to have a Google account. This 
section shows you how to sign up for a Google account if you don’t already 
have one. This section has some tips that may be useful if you decide to 
create a new Google account for your Google Voice use.
The most basic reason for creating a Google account first is that Google won’t 
let you do it any other way. But Google Voice is expected to have cool inte­
gration features with other Google applications that also require a Google 
account, so your effort may pay off in any event.

32
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
If you already have a Google Apps account — especially if you’re paying for it, 
as larger organizations have to do — you might think that you already have an 
account you can use for Google Voice. But, while sensible, you’d be wrong. If 
you already have a Google Apps account, create a new Google account just for 
use with Google Voice, using the steps later in this chapter. (Unfortunately, 
your contacts from your Google Apps account won’t be imported into Google 
Voice either.)
One key expected feature for Google Voice is enhanced integration with 
Gmail. And Gmail is already pretty cool, with some of its advantages being 
particularly pronounced when used with Google Voice:
	
✓	Huge storage: Gmail launched with 2GB of storage per user, which 
was huge at the time and the allocation is constantly growing, for both 
new and existing users. At this writing, it’s grown past 7GB and shows 
no sign of stopping. When you start getting your voicemails as e-mail 
attachments and wanting to access and store them flexibly, huge storage 
will be of, well, huge importance!
	
✓	Great flexibility: Gmail is fully flexible in terms of forwarding and copy­
ing e-mails to other accounts. (Some other free e-mail Web services have 
less flexibility.) This is great for students (who use their school accounts 
more or less at different times of year), young professionals (who tend 
to change jobs a lot) and so on. And it’s great for use with Google Voice.
	
✓	Integration with other e-mail applications and phones: Gmail has both 
POP3 and, lacking from many providers, IMAP support. This makes it 
easy and flexible to fully integrate with Outlook, Apple Mail, and other 
e-mail applications.
	
✓	Special phone applications: Google creates special applications for 
Gmail or Google access on various cell phones. The BlackBerry Gmail 
app is one of the coolest around, as is Gmail support on the iPhone. 
Android has excellent Gmail integration.
	
✓	Integration with Google Apps: Google has a whole set of applications 
called Google Apps, including word processing, a spreadsheet, a calendar, 
support for your own domain name and more. Integration with Gmail, and 
for each app with the others, varies. You can ignore these other Google 
offerings or run a small or medium-sized business off them, at very low 
cost. Google Voice is separate from Google Apps, so how to get them 
working together is up to you. See Chapter 16 for more information.
	
✓	Integration of contacts lists: Gmail is great for importing contacts from 
all sorts of sources, as we describe in Chapter 4. The contacts are auto­
matically synched with your computer. And Gmail’s contacts are shared 
seamlessly with Google Voice.

33
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
	
✓	Offline mode: Gmail is the only Web-based e-mail that also works offline 
for reading and creating messages, a critically important feature for any 
kind of serious e-mail use on cell phones.
	
✓	Translation: Gmail can translate your message to and from many 
languages with a single click, yet another rare capability.
If you already have a Google account and, in particular, if you’re already a Gmail 
user, you’re in good hands. If you’re not, look at the list of features above and see 
if there are any key things on it that Gmail does, and your current e-mail doesn’t. 
If so, consider using Gmail after you set up your Google Account.
Follow these steps to create a Google account:
	
1.	Go to www.Google.com.
	
	 The famous Google Search page appears.
	
2.	Click the Sign in link in the upper-right corner.
	
	 The Google Accounts page appears, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
Consider scrolling down to check the captcha (word verification graphic) near 
the bottom of the page to make sure you can read it before entering anything. 
If you think the captcha might trip you up, click the Refresh button on your 
browser to get a new one before you fill out the page.
	
3.	Click the Create an account now link in the lower-right corner.
	
	 The Create a Google Account page appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Figure 2-4: 
Creating 
a Google 
Account is 
simple.
	
	
4.	Enter your current e-mail address.
	
	 You need an existing e-mail account to “bootstrap” the creation of a 
Gmail account. If you ever have trouble accessing your Gmail account, 
this other account will be your way back in, so choose carefully.
	
5.	Choose a password.
	
	 You need a password of at least 8 characters. Google displays a bar to 
show the relative strength of your password. (A stronger password is 
harder to algorithmically guess.) Mixing letters and numbers and adding 
special characters makes your password stronger.
	
6.	Click the checkbox to remember you on the current computer.
	
	 This option is very convenient — but risks letting others easily access 
your e-mail when they use your computer. Our experience is that Google 
never fully logs you into a computer, but always asks for your password 
before showing your e-mail.
	
7.	Click the checkbox to enable Web history.
	
	 Web history gradually shifts your search results and recommendations 
based on your history. For instance, a water skier who has Web history 
enabled will gradually get different results for searches about “skiing” 
than a snow skier will.

35
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
	
8.	Click the checkbox to set Google as your default homepage.
	
	 Google is as good a homepage as any, especially because searching is the 
first thing you want to do when you open a new Web page. (Though Gmail 
may be even better, you won’t miss voicemail notifications that arrive via 
e-mail, and the Gmail home page has a Google search box on it.)
	
	 If you get used to having Google as your default homepage, searching is 
as easy as opening a new browser window. If you then use a different 
computer that’s set up differently, so you need an extra step to start a 
search, the other computer will seem broken!
	
9.	Choose the country you’re in, or want Google to treat you as if you’re 
in, from the pull-down menu.
	
	 The country you choose gives you options specific for that country in 
Google Search, Google News, and possibly other Google offerings.
	
10.	Type the captcha, the word verification characters, that Google displays.
	
	 The captcha verifies that you’re not a machine creating an e-mail 
account to send spam from.
	
	 Google’s captchas tend to be hard to read, so this may take you a couple 
of tries. Don’t think it will be any easier if you click on the wheelchair 
icon to use the disabled option; a voice reads off a series of digits, which 
you’re supposed to enter, while another voice talks in the background, 
but just as loudly, making it hard to follow the main voice.
	
11.	 Review the Terms of Service in the scrolling box, or click the Printable 
version link, to open them up on a new page and review them.
	
12.	Review your entries and make sure you’re happy with them. If you 
are, click the button: I accept. Create my account.
	
	 Google begins the process of creating your account by sending a verifi­
cation e-mail to the e-mail account you indicated.
	
13.	Visit your other e-mail program and open the e-mail Google sent you.
	
	 The e-mail includes a link to click for verification.
	
14.	Click on the verification link.
	
	 The Web page shown in Figure 2-5 appears to confirm that your account 
has been created.
For the user name, type yourusername@yourgoogleappsdomain.com. 
For instance, if you have a Google Apps domain called gvdaily.com, and your 
username is heyuser, then enter heyuser@gvdaily.com as the user name.

Setting Up a Google Profile
A Google Profile is a lot like a Facebook page. Once set up properly, it has 
your picture, your name, and a brief description. It can even allow people to 
contact you without showing your e-mail address.
It might seem like a lot of extra bother to set up a Google Profile, especially if 
you already have a Facebook page, a MySpace page or something similar. But 
Google Profiles will become ever more important as more and more people 
use Google services.
For example, a Google Profile makes you much easier to find by people using 
search engines, including the leader, Google. Create the profile; then make it 
public.
For anyone who begins using Google Voice, the service will probably become 
a “tipping point” that causes you to spend a lot more time interacting with 
Google. As you do so, and as friends, family members, and work colleagues 
do so as well, the value of having a Google Profile will grow.
A Profile can serve a similar function to a Facebook page; if you already have 
a Facebook page, you might want to crib some of the content from it to use 
on your Profile!

 Chapter 2: Getting Ready for Google Voice
	
As with Facebook and other social networking tools, having an online record 
like this one can cause problems as well as benefits. For example, if you’re 
making a career change and have a new CV carefully calling attention to what 
is actually your rather limited sales experience, your Google Profile page iden­
tifying you in your current role as a nuclear physicist may cause confusion for 
potential employers. (Or vice versa.) Consider keeping the careers informa­
tion in your Profile a bit vague if needed to give you flexibility.
	
Always “Google” yourself before applying for a new role and specifically check 
resources like your Facebook page, MySpace page, Google Profile and so on. 
Make sure you’re ready to discuss all the results.
Follow these steps to set up a Google Profile:
	
1.	Go to the Google home page at www.google.com and sign in.
	
	 Your account information appears. The information includes part of your 
(empty) Profile, your personal settings, and a list of the products you use.
	
2.	Click the Create a profile link.
	
	 The Create your profile page appears, as shown in Figure 2-6.
	
3.	Fill in the fields with your information: your name, where you grew 
up, where you live, and so on.

4.	Click Change Picture to upload a picture of yourself.
	
	 Nothing livens up Google Voice and other Google applications like 
photos. Make life a little more interesting for your online friends by 
uploading a photo — and ask them to do the same for you.
	
5.	Create a short bio.
	
	 Try to gracefully split the difference between the lively, fun, caring 
person your friends and family know and the, for instance, ruthlessly 
efficient, profitability-obsessed, power-hungry automaton you appear to 
be to your work colleagues.
	
6.	Link to other online information resources about yourself. Click Add 
after each link.
	
	 It might look like you can only create one link, but actually you can 
create as many as you like.
	
7.	Keep the default URL (which uses your Google e-mail user name) or 
choose a random one that Google will generate for you. Click the link 
See other options to display the alternative URL you can use for your 
profile.
	
	 A random URL appears as a choice next to the one which uses your 
Google e-mail user name.
	
	 The URL is exposing your Google e-mail user name. This could expose 
you to spam. (As can any other online information that includes your 
e-mail address.) Though Gmail has excellent spam control tools, you 
may not want to add a possible entry point for spammers. If so, use the 
random URL.
	
8.	Click the Create a Google profile button to create your profile.
	
	 Your new profile appears onscreen.

I
n one sense, setting up Google Voice is something you do once, when 
you create your account and make your initial setup choices. But it’s also 
something you do over and over again as you use Google Voice and your 
phones. And something which you will redo, at least to some extent, if you 
move or change jobs or just get a new mobile phone.
How you set up Google Voice also changes how people reach you. (See the 
previous chapter.) So there are some really interesting decisions involved.
If you’re new to Google Voice, you might find it a bit overwhelming. But don’t 
worry; you’re onto a winner. It seems, at the time of this writing, that Google 
Voice, or something very much like it, will become a normal part of using 
telephones for many years to come.
As you set up Google Voice, just remember that the goal is to make your life 
simpler and more enjoyable. For most of us, that means the goal is to “set it 
and forget it,” to first get Google Voice configured with your phones in a way 
that works well, then not have to change things much. This chapter can help 
you do things right the first time.
Some people, though, enjoy endlessly experimenting with Google Voice, 
their phones, Google Voice applications for smartphones, other third-party 
applications and devices, and all the options available on each. Because each 

40
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
individual situation is different, we can only hope to get you experimenters 
off to a good start with Google Voice. We then leave it to you to make it work 
exactly how you want it to as that changes each day.
Getting Invited
If you haven’t received a Google Voice invitation yet, visit voice.google.
com and sign up to get one. You just need to enter your name and e-mail 
address. Google e-mails you when they’re ready to invite you to Google 
Voice. Or, you may be required to get an invitation from a current user, 
as was the case with Gmail for many months. Google uses these delays to 
smooth out peaks in signups for, and usage of, the service.
Speaking of which, you may want to prepare by creating a Google account 
now, while you’re waiting. See the steps at the end of Chapter 2 for specific 
instructions. And read the rest of Chapter 2 so you can think about how you 
want to use your phones with Google Voice.
	
A Google Apps account allows you to use options such as Google Docs, a set 
of online applications, similar to Microsoft Office. While individual accounts 
are free, large organizations that use Google Docs pay a small annual fee per 
user. If you already have a Google Apps account, you might think that you 
already have an account you can use for Google Voice. But, while sensible, 
you’d be wrong.
If you already have a Google Apps account, create a new Google account 
just for use with Google Voice, using the steps at the end of Chapter 2. For 
the user name, type yourusername@yourgoogleappsdomain.com. For 
example, if you have a Google Apps domain called gvdaily.com, and your 
username is heyuser, then enter heyuser@gvdaily.com as the user name.
Choosing an Area Code 
and Phone Number
It’s finally appeared. What you may have been awaiting for months, or per­
haps even, if you were trying to get into GrandCentral, for years: the e-mail 
from Google inviting you to sign up for your Google Voice account!
Your first job is to follow the link in the e-mail and choose your Google Voice 
number. After you do this, your Google Voice account is activated. Although 
you need to perform a lot of other steps to get much use out of your account, 
choosing your Google Voice number is the crucial step that establishes your 
account.

41
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
Going in, choosing a Google Voice number has a lot of limitations, including:
	
✓	If the area code you want is not available, you have to choose a nearby 
area code, preferably in the same state. (Again, to increase the odds of 
free or cheap calls to your Google Voice number from various phones.)
	
✓	You can’t choose an international number, nor can you forward calls 
from Google Voice to an international number.
	
✓	Vanity numbers and 800 numbers are not available.
	
✓	You can’t choose an extension as your Google Voice number.
	
✓	You can’t even forward Google Voice calls to an extension, which is a 
major problem for many people with regards to their jobs.
	
✓	You can’t port another number to Google Voice, though Google says, in 
Google Voice Help, “we hope to offer this option in the near future.”
Setting up your phone number
The first step is to choose an area code. In the previous chapter, we 
described how to choose the area code you want to have for your Google 
Voice number. Now it’s time to actually choose it. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the e-mail from Google.
	
	 The e-mail appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
Figure 3-1:

2.	Click the Click here to sign into Google Voice link. If you’re asked to 
sign into your Google account, do so. If you don’t yet have a Google 
account, use the steps at the end of Chapter 2 to sign up for one.
	
	 Your Web browser opens and the Choose an Area Code screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
Figure 3-2: 
Choose an 
area code 
for your 
Google 
Voice 
number.
	
	
3.	Inspect the available area codes and choose the one you want.
	
	 In most cases, you want the same area code as your home phone, work 
phone, or cell phone, so you can conveniently make calls to your Google 
Voice number and be sure that the call is free.
	
	 If your cell phone number is different from your home or work phones, 
consider tilting toward the area code used by one of your landlines in 
choosing your Google Voice area code. Calls from a landline to Google 
Voice won’t incur any charges if the call is local.
	
4.	Click Accept to finalize choosing the number.
	
5.	Dial the number to test it.
	
	 Try calling the number. You should get Google Voice voicemail message, 
because you have not yet set up Google Voice to ring any actual phones. 
We explain how in the following sections.

Want to find out if a number you’re considering spells something great — or 
something awful? Visit www.phonespell.org, shown in the figure, and enter 
the phone number you’re considering. A family member of one of the authors 
is “lucre wary” — being distrustful of money is something to avoid if you’re in 
business!
Disseminating your new phone number
Excuse the fancy word, but you now have a task ahead of you — to get your 
new Google Voice number out to all the friends, family, and colleagues and 
suppliers of goods and services who have your cell phone number or home 
phone number. (Perhaps those who have your work number as well, if you 
want your work calls to go through Google Voice.)
We hope that your effort isn’t reminiscent of the voice-over for the introduc­
tion of the Star Trek television series: a “five-year mission” that requires you “to 
boldly go where no one has gone before.” But it might feel like that sometimes!
We describe how to manage all your phones in relation to Google Voice in 
Chapter 2. Here’s a quick list of ideas to help you get your new number out:
	
✓	Send out new business cards. Your new business cards can list your 
Google Voice number in place of your cell phone number. Include a 
cover note describing why you’re making the change, and how respon­
sive you’ll be able to be with the new services afforded by Google Voice. 
(Don’t mention that you’ll now be able to take a bath without fear of 
interruption for the first time in years!)
	
✓	E-mail and call all your contacts. Send out an update to everyone you 
know with your new Google Voice number. Again, explain how you’ll 
now be more accessible.
	
✓	Ignore calls that don’t come through Google Voice. Calls from Google 
Voice can be set up to announce the caller and let you listen in on them 
as they leave a message. If a call comes to you that isn’t through Google 
Voice, ignore it.
	
✓	Change your greeting on your cell phone message. When someone 
calls your cell phone directly, not through Google Voice, let them go 
through to voicemail. They get a message that gives your new Google 
Voice number and doesn’t ask them to leave a message on your cell 
phone.
	
✓	Debark your home phone. Turn off (or, more brutally, disable) the 
ringer on your home phone. Record a message on your home phone 
number giving the Google Voice or other number(s) for everyone in your 
family or group of housemates.

44
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
✓	Give people your Google Voice e-mail address. You can give people 
your Google e-mail address, which is just the ten digits of your Google 
Voice number, plus @googlevoice.com. This gets the number in their 
hands, and the messages forward to the real e-mail account you have set 
up to use with Google Voice.
After you’ve let everyone you can think of know your new number, some of them 
might still use the old one(s) — and there might be some people you missed.
	
Google Voice makes it much easier to deal with cell phone calls, especially 
from people you don’t want to deal with urgently. Because you can limit your 
immediate accessibility to the people you care about most, there’s a tempta­
tion to give your cell phone number out more widely.
Giving your number out too widely is a big problem. If you give your new number 
out too widely, you trigger a flood of phone calls; if you don’t answer them, the 
phone calls are followed by e-mails with transcribed voicemail messages.
Keep your Google Voice number close. Even think twice about sending it to 
each and every one of your current contacts. No sense in triggering a flood of 
“how you doing?” responses that you then have to deal with. Maybe you can 
wait and let some people know along with sending out holiday cards.
	
If you really want to be ruthless about it and force a changeover by everyone 
you know to your new Google Voice number, here’s how to go the extra mile — 
and save money in the process:
	
✓	Change your home phone number. Get a new home phone number. 
(Tell the phone company you’ve been getting annoying calls on the old 
number, which is true enough.) Don’t give it out to anyone. Just use it 
for Google Voice.
	
✓	Get rid of your home phone. Simplify your life and save big bucks: 
be like so many young people today and get rid of your landline. With 
Google Voice, you can manage calls to your cell phone by who is calling 
you, not by which of your phones rings.
	
✓	Change your cell phone number. This one is the “dark side of the force” 
approach to stopping people from calling you on your cell phone. Drop 
your old cell phone number. (You may have to add a second phone to 
your plan and then drop or just stop using the SIM card of the first one. 
It’s worth it.) Then, set up Google Voice to display the Google Voice 
number when it’s calling, as described in the next chapter rather than 
the caller’s number and only answer when you see that number.
	
✓	Get rid of your cell phone. Here’s the real Zen guru approach to using 
Google Voice! Make your life more peaceful. Receive all your calls as 
voicemail messages through Google Voice on your computer or, if 
you’re traveling, a laptop, netbook, or the nearest Internet café. Reply 
only by e-mail or SMS text messages sent through Google Voice.

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
Getting General Settings Correct
Many of the cool features of Google Voice are controlled by the General tab 
in the Settings area. Before you use Google Voice, you need to do a bit of 
work to make some features work properly, in the same way you would set 
up a new voicemail system.
The General settings can be divided into two groups. The first few settings 
are truly general; they affect the handling of all calls to your Google Voice 
number. The remaining settings affect what happens when you’re actually 
interacting with a call as it rings the phone(s) that you have nearby.
Does anybody really know what time it is?
When you select a time zone from the pull-
down menu, you see that Google Voice has a 
rather idiosyncratic list of time zones. You might 
expect a list of 24 options — one per time zone. 
Instead, there are dozens more with variations 
on the main ones. The list is alphabetized oddly, 
too.
Actually, the list is capturing some of the many 
exceptions to standardized time zones found in 
specific states and cities. For example, Arizona 
is in the Mountain time zone, but it doesn’t 
observe Daylight Savings Time. And the list is 
alphabetized according to the locality name, 
ignoring the name of the overall time zone 
where that’s included.
The default time zone in the scrolling list is 
Eastern Time, which is GMT-5 hours. (This zone, 
like the others, takes daylight savings time into 
account.) Atlantic Time (Halifax), the part of 
Canada east of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, is 
GMT-6 hours. It’s a bit below Eastern Time in 
the list. The other choices for North America, 
moving west, are progressively further above 
Eastern Time in the list.
When choosing from the scrolling list, you 
should look for the specific city or locality you’re 
in, and choose it if it’s reflected. Otherwise, use 
the major time zone that covers everyplace 
else. For convenience, the major time zones for 
North America, as given in the scrolling list, are:
	✓	(GMT-10:00) Hawaii Time
	✓	(GMT-09:00) Alaska Time
	✓	(GMT-08:00) Pacific Time
	✓	(GMT-07:00) Mountain Time (America/
Denver)
	✓	(GMT-07:00) Mountain Time (Arizona)
	✓	(GMT-06:00) Central Time
	✓	(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time*
	✓	(GMT-04:00) Atlantic Time (Halifax)
	✓	Eastern Time is the default setting for 
Google Voice.

Choosing General settings 1: 
Overall settings
These steps tell you how to handle the initial group of General settings for 
Google Voice, which affect your overall account: the language used, the time 
zone you’re in, the general voicemail greeting, and you’re recorded name.
Follow these steps to set the first group of General settings for Google Voice:
	
1.	Go to the Google Voice page at voice.google.com, or by choosing 
Voice from the My products list shown after you sign into the home 
page of your Google account at www.google.com.
	
	 The Google Voice page appears.
	
2.	Click the Settings link at the top right of the page.
	
	 The Settings section appears, with the General tab highlighted, as shown 
in Figure 3-3.
	
Figure 3-3: 
 To get 
ready, get 
Settings 
right.
	
	
3.	Verify the Language and Time Zone.
	
	 Verify the language choice. At this writing, the only choice is English 
(U.S.). For the Time Zone, choose your time zone; the default is (GMT-
05:00) Eastern Time. See the “Does anybody really know what time it is?” 
sidebar for details.

47
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
	 The Time Zone setting determines the voicemail and call time settings 
that show up on the Google Voice Web site and the time stamp on voice­
mail notifications. It also affects ring schedules for specific phones; see 
the “Ring schedules and time zones” sidebar, and the following section 
for details.
	
4.	Look to see which Voicemail Greeting is selected; play it back if 
needed. Add additional greetings if you wish.
	
	 The standard greeting for Google Voice is a woman with a neutral 
American accent saying, “The Google Voice subscriber you have called 
is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” This greeting 
may be appropriate for all situations, or you may want to leave a per­
sonalized greeting. You can record additional greetings and use them 
instead of the System Standard.
	
	 See the next section, “Get Your Name or Greeting on Record,” for 
instructions.
	
	 Google Voice has a general greeting, plus separate greetings for groups 
of users: Friends, Family, and Coworkers. You can even have specific 
greetings for specific people! If you do create a greeting at this level, it 
will be available in your greetings menu to use with other callers as well.
	
5.	Click Play to hear the Recorded Name. Change it if you want, as 
shown in Step 6.
	
	 The pre-existing recorded name is “The subscriber,” spoken in a 
mechanical-sounding voice. You probably want to change this. See the 
next section, “Sharing Your Greetings,” for instructions.
	
6.	Click Record New to change the greeting.
	
	 Google Voice will try to open a dialog. Your browser may block this 
and display an error message instead. Look in your browser window 
and clear the error message that is probably at the top of your browser 
window and proceed. (You may need to click Record New again.)
	
	 A dialog box appears like the one in Figure 3-4.
	
7.	Use the pull-down menu to choose a phone for Google Voice to call 
you on — or, enter a number directly, including the area code. If you 
want to remember the choice, click the checkbox to set it. Click the 
Connect button.
	
	 Watch carefully: A response briefly appears, “Calling. . . ” and the 
destination.
	
	 The designated phone will ring, and Google Voice will know that this is 
the first time you’ve called into your own voicemail, and prompt you to 
record your name, so callers know who they’ve reached.

48
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
8.	Click Play to hear the recording of your name and check that you’re 
happy with it. Press the pound (#) key to save it.
	
	 You’re then prompted to go on and record a greeting.
	
9.	Record your greeting. Press the pound key to save it.
	
10.	 To be notified of new voicemails by e-mail, select the Email 
message to checkbox. From the pull-down menu, select any of the 
e-mail addresses you have already associated with your Google 
account, which will already be listed; or click the Add a new email 
address link to add another e-mail address.
	
	 If you click the link, your Google Account page with your personal infor­
mation appears. Use this page to add additional e-mail addresses to your 
account.
	
11.	To be notified of new voicemails by text (SMS), click the Send a text 
(SMS) message to: checkbox in the Notifications section. Use the pull-
down menu to choose one (and only one) of the cell phones associated 
with your account.
	
	 Having the two Notifications options right next to each other can be a 
bit confusing, because you can turn them on and off independently of 
each other. A new voicemail message can cause you to get an e-mail 
message and a text (SMS) message; just an e-mail; just an SMS; or 
neither.
	
	 Only phones that have been verified for your account and designated as 
mobile phones can be selected for notification. (You can have several 
phones designated as mobiles verified for your account, but each such 
phone can only be associated with one Google Voice account at a time.)
	
	 If the phone you need is not available in the pull-down list, use the steps 
in the section below “Verifying Your Phones” section to add it. Google 
Voice displays an on-screen code, then calls your phone and prompts 
you to enter it. Then return to this tab and select it for text messaging.
	
12.	Test your settings work so far. Call your Google Voice number from a 
friend’s phone and leave a message; listen to the voicemail greeting 
and the recorded name. Then return to the Google Voice Web site 
and look at the time stamp on the voicemail message to make sure the 
time zone is correct. Verify that you got an e-mail alert (if you asked 
for one) and a text (SMS) message (if you asked for one).
	
	 Change any settings that are incorrect.

49
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
Sharing your greetings
One of the most fun and highly valued things people do with Google Voice 
is to have different voicemail greetings for business colleagues, friends, and 
family — even for different individual callers.
When you add a voicemail greeting to Google Voice, it goes into a scrolling 
list of recorded greetings. You can use any greeting from this list as your 
General (default) greeting; specifically for Friends, Family or Coworkers; or, 
even more specifically, for individual callers.
	
We recommend that you begin by recording a new greeting to use as your new 
Voicemail Greeting in the General section, as described in Step 4 of the earlier 
Global Settings section. The System Standard greeting is pretty bad.
Follow these steps to record a new greeting for Google Voice and switch 
greetings:
	
1.	Go to any of the Web pages that accept greetings settings: The General 
tab under Settings; the Friends, Family or Co-workers Edit pages 
under Groups; or the Google Voice settings page (not the generic Edit 
page) for a specific contact under Contacts.
	
2.	Click Add to add a new greeting.
	
	 Google Voice tries to open a dialog box. Your browser may alert you 
that you have pop-ups blocked for this site. You should allow Google 
Voice to open pop-ups. Then proceed. (You may need to click Add 
again.)
	
	 A dialog box appears, such as the one shown in Figure 3-4.
	
3.	Type the name of the greeting and press Enter.
	
	 The Record Greeting dialog box appears, as also shown in Figure 3-4.
	
	 Give specific and memorable names for your greetings, or it will be all 
too easy to forget what they are — and then, in a hurry, to assign the 
message where you burp out the first few bars of “Jingle Bells” to your 
boss! (For example, name such a greeting “Burped Jingle Bells,” rather 
than just “Jingle Bells,” to remind yourself of how to use it appropriately 
in the future.)
	
	 You can arrange with a friend to record a greeting for you. Call the 
friend directly first to set it up, then choose or enter their number in the 
next step.

you on, or enter a number directly, including the area code. If you 
wish to remember the choice, click the checkbox to set it. Click the 
Connect button.
	
	 Watch carefully: A response briefly appears, “Calling…” and the 
destination.
	
5.	The designated phone will ring, and Google Voice will prompt you — 
or your friend — to record the greeting. When you’re done, press the 
pound key.
	
	 The recording is played back to you.
	
6.	Press 1 to accept the greeting or 2 to re-record it.
	
	 If you re-record the greeting, it will be played back to you. Repeat this 
step until you’re happy. (The greeting may be played back hundreds of 
times, so you want to have it right. No pressure then!)
	
7.	Record additional greetings if you care to.
	
	 Consider a general greeting for all callers, group-specific greetings for 
friends, family members, and co-workers, and individual greetings for 
the people who call you most. Use the links to re-record, rename or 
delete any greetings as needed.

51
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
	 When it comes to creating a set of greetings, there’s no time like the 
present! You get more out of Google Voice by taking a bit of time for 
setup steps like this one.
	
8.	Call your Google Voice number and check that the voicemail message 
you have selected works correctly.
	
	Consider changing the voicemail greeting in the General tab so you can 
hear all the greetings you plan to use before others do, then return it to 
the voicemail greeting you want to have in the General tab.
	
	 Re-record any greetings that aren’t up to snuff.
Choosing General settings 2: 
Handling live calls
After you have your truly global settings in hand, it’s time to specify how 
Google Voice will handle specific calls that actually get through and make 
one or more of your phones ring. Figure 3-5 shows the options in question.
	
Figure 3-5: 
How should 
you ring 
me? Let me 
count the 
ways. . . .
	

52
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Some of the settings don’t mean quite what you would think, so fasten your 
seat belts — it’s going to be a bumpy ride!
You’ll be interacting with the voice of Google Voice, a generic female voice 
which we refer to as Genevieve.
Follow these steps to set up how Google Voice handles specific calls and 
voicemails:
	
1.	Click the checkbox to Enable screening of your calls.
	
	 The language here is a bit confusing. You might think screening is what 
you do when you decide whether to answer a call depending on who’s 
calling. But Google Voice uses screening to mean the step before that. 
To Google Voice, screening means “asking the caller to state their name, 
and then playing it back to the Google Voice user.”
	
	 Google Voice shows either the Google Voice number or any Caller ID 
phone number on your Caller ID display, depending on the option set­
ting you choose. (We describe this in Chapter 4.) If the phone number is 
in your Contacts, The voice of Google Voice (Genevieve) also speaks the 
contact’s name out loud.
	
	 This option is about what to do if the phone number is blocked, or is not 
blocked but is not in your Contact list. If you enable screening, Google 
Voice can ask the caller to state their name; Google Voice records what 
they say and plays it back to you so you can screen your non-Contacts 
calls.
	
	 When Google Voice gets a call from a number that’s not in your 
Contacts, Genevieve asks the caller for their name and stores it. Your 
next call from the same number causes the same recording to play, even 
if it’s a different person calling from the same phone number. This can 
be confusing!
	
2.	If you enabled screening, select the first radio button to Screen all 
unknown callers, or select the second radio button to Screen only 
blocked callers.
	
	 The wording here is confusing. The first option, Screen all unknown 
callers, really means “Get and play back a name if the caller’s number 
is blocked, or if the number is unblocked, but not associated with a 
Contact.” The second option, Screen only blocked callers, really means 
“Get and play back a name only if the caller’s number is blocked.”
	
	 If you want to screen calls, we suggest you use the first option, Screen 
all unknown callers, unless you have a good reason to use the other 
option. It’s hard to think of when you’d want to screen only blocked call­
ers. For unblocked callers, you do have their phone number which can 

53
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
(often, not always) be displayed to you via your phone’s Caller ID dis­
play, but if you knew the number well enough to recognize it, you prob­
ably would have associated it with a contact and not have this issue.
	
	 One of the great joys of using Google Voice is being able to screen out 
unknown callers; only the Screen all unknown callers option really helps 
you do that.
	
3.	Choose a Call presentation option — On to have Genevieve speak 
your phone options on each call, including the option to ListenIn™ 
on voicemail, or Off to directly connect the call when the phone is 
answered.
	
	 After Genevieve announces the caller, if call presentation is on, she 
states four ways to handle the call:
 
•  1 to accept it,
 
• 2 to send it to voicemail,
 
• 3 to ListenIn™ on the voicemail, or
 
• 4 to accept the call and record it.
	
	(The recording is announced so the caller knows it’s happening.) If call 
presentation is off, you just connect straight to the call (option 1).
	
	 Google likes the ListenIn name so much they’ve trademarked it. Google 
Voice users like the ListenIn option so much they consistently name it 
as one of their favorite features of Google Voice. So we suggest that you 
begin with this option On and only turn it off if you find it to be a waste 
of your time.
	
	 Forcing the call to voicemail by using Call presentation has another 
advantage — it makes sure the voicemail message is left in Google Voice, 
with centralization, access from multiple points, optional alerting and 
transcription and so on. If you just let the call ring through, and a voice­
mail system associated with one of the ringing phones gets it first, the 
voicemail message will be on that system instead, which defeats part of 
the purpose of Google Voice. In use, Google Voice does seem to take the 
voicemail message most of the time.
 	
4.	Choose a Caller ID option — Display the caller’s number or display 
the Google Voice number.
	
	 You can have the caller’s number displayed or you can have your own 
Google Voice number displayed. You really need to see both so you can 
guess who’s calling (from having the caller’s number displayed) and so 
you know what your options are (from having the Google Voice number 
displayed if the call is from Google Voice).

54
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
	 We recommend that you have the caller’s number display and quickly 
get everyone using your Google Voice number so you can safely assume 
that you have Google Voice capabilities on all your calls.
	
5.	Add a Voicemail PIN if you want. After the New PIN prompt, type a 
four-digit PIN code. After the prompt, Confirm PIN, type the same 
code.
	
	 If you don’t use a PIN, you can only check your voicemail from a Web 
browser or from a phone that you’ve directly connected to Google Voice 
voicemail, typically your cell phone. (See the “Verifying Your Phones” 
section for how to set this up.)
	
	 If you do use a PIN, you can optionally be required to enter it when you 
call from a directly connected phone. But the real magic is when you 
call your Google Voice number from any non-directly connected phone 
and press the * key during the greeting. If you’ve set up a PIN, but only if 
you’ve set up a PIN, Google Voice prompts you for the PIN, then allows 
you access to voicemail.
	
	 Enter your PIN carefully both times, as differing entries won’t be flagged 
until you press Save Changes (see Step 10 below). Worse, if you care­
lessly make the same mistake twice, you’ll set a PIN code that you don’t 
know; you’ll have to contact Google to somehow get it cleared or delete 
your account and start over.
	
6.	Click the checkbox to set it and enable the Do Not Disturb option. 
This sends all calls made to your Google Voice number straight to 
voicemail.
	
	 You can also turn Do Not Disturb on and off by dialing into your Google 
Voicemail. It’s too bad this option is somewhat buried in the Google 
Voice site and also takes several key presses to turn on and off in 
Google Voice voicemail, as it’s an important option you’re likely to 
use frequently.
	
	 Consider bookmarking this page on your computer and, if you have this 
capability, smartphone’s Web browsers. Then you can change the set­
ting quickly.
	
7.	Click the checkbox to enable voicemail transcripts. Clear the check­
box to disable them.
	
	 This is a key feature of Google Voice. We recommend that you turn it on 
at first and only turn it off again if it proves to be more annoying than 
helpful.
	
8.	Click the link to change your Google Account Settings, such as your 
e-mail addresses, security options, shipping address, payment method, 
and so on.

	 See Figure 3-6 to see an example of a Google Account and to get an idea 
of the options you can change.

9.	Click Save Changes to store the changes you’ve made or Cancel to 
clear them.
	
10.	Test the settings you changed. See if your calls are screened, and if 
you get options when calls are made to you. Leave and pick up voice­
mail messages.
	
	 Make any changes you need to in the settings to get them working the 
way you want them to.
That’s it, the end of a long journey, from the top of the settings under the 
General tab to the bottom.
	
We recommend that you test each of the option settings you’ve just chosen 
to make sure it works the way you expect. Doing this might require the help 
of a friend, or some juggling by you as you hold a phone in each hand! The 
best time to check is now — not to have your new system fail, or work in some 
wondrously unexpected way, just when you need it.

Verifying Your Phones
Your Google Voice number is your new input for phone calls. It can output 
them in three ways:
	
✓	Voicemail link.
	
✓	Voicemail message transcripts.
	
✓	Phone calls to one or more of your numbers.
It’s the third of these that we’re concerned about: phone calls to your 
numbers.
The key word there is your, as in your numbers. Google Voice doesn’t let you 
forward calls to your Google Voice number to just any old phone numbers. 
You have to prove you have access to the numbers so that you can verify 
them first.
You will need to do this at one or more times when you have access to your 
home phone, work phone, and of course your cell phone — even to the 
phone of a friend or family member who you might hang out with sometimes, 
and want to forward your calls to.
	
You can’t use an extension as a target for forwarding calls. If you have an 
extension phone near you, you have to use your cell phone instead or go 
without.
Though Google Voice isn’t very smart about extensions, it’s quite specific 
about how it uses and shares other phones. It allows up to two people to 
enter the same home phone or office phone number.
Ring schedules and time zones
If you use the Ring Schedules feature for spe­
cific phones that you’ve verified for use with 
Google Voice, the Time Zone settings deter­
mine when the phone is prevented from ring­
ing. If you change the time zone because you’re 
travelling, this changes the on and off times for 
phones that may not be on the move with you. 
You may need to change the ring schedule for 
one or more of your phones to reflect this; see 
the following section for how to do this.
This is a good reason to think carefully before 
using ring schedules, or to manage them care­
fully if you do.

57
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
But that’s only two, so if you have two adults and two kids, all with your own 
cell phones, you can’t all have Google Voice accounts pointing to the same 
home phone. So if you have crowds at work or home, plan in advance which 
two people get to claim a given phone number in Google Voice.
Only one person can associate their Google Voice account with any one cell 
phone number.
Being there
Being There is a 1979 film in which Peter Sellers plays a gardener who 
becomes an adviser to business leaders and presidents. (It’s worth seeing or 
seeing again.) Being there is also what you’ll have to do when you verify each 
of the phones you want to use with Google Voice.
	
To complete the verification steps described in this section for a specific 
phone, you have to have access to it. For example, to verify your work phone 
as a phone you can control via Google Voice, you have to be near it or have it 
forwarded to a phone you are near. That’s because, after you enter the details 
of a phone into the Google Voice Web site, Google Voice shows you a confir­
mation code and then calls the phone in question.
You have to answer the phone and enter the confirmation code. Only then is 
the phone verified as a phone you can use with Google Voice.
Getting your Gizmo number
You can use Gizmo5, also known as the Gizmo 
Project, for voice calls, video calls, and text 
messaging from your PC. PC to PC calls are free; 
other calls are available at low cost. Gizmo runs 
on cell phones, where it uses mobile phone plan 
minutes (and may incur data transfer charges) 
but does not incur long distance charges. To 
learn more, go to www.gizmo5.com.
If you’re a Gizmo user, and want to use your 
Gizmo phone with Google Voice, you need the 
phone number for it. To get your Gizmo phone 
number, go to my.gizmo5.com. Your phone 
number is displayed below your name and most 
likely has the area code 747.
If you’re interested, 747 is, like, totally the code 
for the San Fernando Valley section of Los 
Angeles (made sort of famous in the Moon Unit 
Zappa song Valley Girl and the movie based on 
the song).
For more about Gizmo, see Chapter 15.

Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
This is true for a business phone, your home phone, your cell phone (that 
one should be easy), a phone at a friend or family member’s house, and any 
other phone that you want to forward calls to through Google Voice.
So you may need to complete the process of verifying all the phones you 
want to control via Google Voice over time, and with a bit of travelling 
around; and you may need to repeat these steps when you’re on a trip, for 
instance, and want to use a nearby phone through Google Voice.
Stepping through verification
Follow these steps to verify a phone number:
	
1.	Go to the Google Voice page at voice.google.com, or by choosing 
Voice from the My products list shown on your account home page.
	
	 The Google Voice page appears.
	
2.	Click the Settings link at the top of the page.
	
	 The Settings section appears, with the General tab highlighted.
	
3.	Click the Phones link.
	
	 The Phones tab appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
	
Figure 3-7: 
 Make it 
easy to 
phone home 
or your 
other

59
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
4.	Click the Add another phone link.
	
	 The Add a new phone page appears, as shown in Figure 3-8.
	
5.	Enter the name of the phone.
	
	 Enter a name that clearly identifies the phone. You’ll probably be setting 
up your call forwarding in a hurry at some point — perhaps through a 
mobile phone interface in the moments before your plane takes off, for 
example. You want to make it easy to do things right.
	
6.	Enter the phone’s number.
	
	 Enter the number of the phone. Use the format (XXX) YYY-ZZZZ for 
consistency with Google Voice. (For a Gizmo phone, the number is 
on your my.gizmo.com page. For details, see the “Getting Your Gizmo 
Number” sidebar.)
	
7.	Enter the type of phone.
	
	 Enter the type of phone: Mobile (SMS messages will only go to phones 
designated as mobiles), Work, Home, or Gizmo. Only one Google Voice 
account can claim a given mobile number; two Google Voice accounts 
can claim the same work or home number. Gizmo is a phone-to-phone 
Voice over IP service; see the sidebar for information on how to get the 
phone number to use for your Gizmo account.

Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
8.	For phones designated as Mobile only, click the check box if you want 
to receive SMS messages on this phone.
	
	 The next steps are tricky. They’re both somewhat hidden behind an 
Advanced Settings tab. The first one is pretty much a one-time set and 
forget kind of setting, while the other is something you do want to get 
right at the beginning but may want to alter in the future.
	
9.	Click Show Advanced Settings.
	
	 The Voicemail Access and Ring Schedule fields appear. We describe the 
Voicemail Access setting, which is included in Figure 3-4, here, and the 
Ring Schedule setting in the next section.
	
10.	Set Voicemail Access to Yes for phones that you usually use exclu­
sively and No for shared phones.
	
	 This step usually means setting Voicemail Access to Yes for your cell 
phone and No for your other phones.
	
	 The Voicemail Access setting is a bit misnamed. It should really be 
called “Go Directly to Voicemail” or something similar.
	
	 You always have access to your Google Voice voicemail when calling 
one of your phones; just press the * button on your phone after the 
other phone has started ringing. But if you choose Yes for this setting, 
calling your Google Voice number from this number will go directly to 
your Google Voice voicemail, without the opportunity to let the call ring 
through.
	
	 So if you set this setting to Yes for your home phone, and someone tries 
to call you on your mobile from your home, they’ll go straight to your 
voicemail. To avoid confusion, you should do what Google says in a help 
message to try to clarify things: “Only select this option if you do not 
share this phone with anyone else.” Ever.
	
11.	If you set Voicemail Access to Yes, then click the radio button for PIN 
required, if you want to protect your voicemail, or PIN not required, if 
you want to get straight to it.
	
	 The PIN is set in the Settings tab.
	
	 We describe how to set the ring schedule separately, in the next section, 
as the fields described here are long-term settings; you may change the 
ring schedule more frequently (for example, each time you have a day 
off work). For now, you can leave the ring schedule set to the default, 
which is that calls set to ring through on this phone always do so.

61
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
12.	If you want to set the ring schedule for the phone now, refer to the 
steps in the next section.
	
	 You can proceed to verify the phone now. You can then change the ring 
schedule, and other settings for a specific phone, without re-verifying it.
	
13.	Click Save.
	
	 The Verify your Phone dialog box appears, with a phone verification 
code, as shown in Figure 3-9.
	
Figure 3-9: 
Now it’s 
time to 
verify the 
phone 
number.
	
	
14.	In the pop-up dialog box, click Connect.
	
	 The phone you’re verifying rings.
	
15.	Pick up the phone. Google Voice prompts you, verbally, to enter the 
verification code you see in the Verify your Phone pop-up. Enter it 
using the phone’s keypad.
	
	 Google Voice hangs up the phone, and the on-screen process is com­
plete. You are returned to the Phones tab onscreen, with the new phone 
added to your list of verified phones.

62
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
16.	Repeat this process for all the phones you want to use with your 
Google Voice number.
	
	 This may involve travelling to a friend’s house or waiting until the next 
time you’re at work, for example. Focus on getting this done, because 
you won’t be able to set and forget many of your Google Voice settings 
until you do.
	
17.	Test the results.
	
	 Test all the settings from the General tab and all the phones listed here. 
Better that you find out any problems than that your callers do.
Setting Which Phones Ring
The key to using Google Voice is having control over which phones ring 
when. So, by using the Ring Schedule setting, Google Voice allows you to 
control whether one of your, which sounds simple. But it doesn’t allow you 
to control whether the phone rings when someone calls it directly, which is 
something you might want but Google Voice can’t do. Google Voice can only 
manage calls that people make to your Google Voice number.
The Ring Schedule setting allows you to control “only” whether one of your 
phones rings when Google Voice routes a call through to it at a specific time.
Until you’ve actually used Google Voice, this takes a little imagination. So 
imagine that you’ve set up Google Voice so that calls from some callers only 
go to your work phone, and further imagine that your work phone is in your 
study. You don’t want your work phone ringing during non-working hours. 
(So your contacts in, say, Singapore don’t get confused about time zone dif­
ferences and make the phone in your study ring in the middle of the night.)
In a sense, you’re turning off that phone — for calls routed to it through 
Google Voice — on some days or times of day. If that phone is completely 
controlled through Google Voice — which you may have achieved, using 
some of the more radical steps described earlier in this chapter — it will only 
ring on calls that first go to Google Voice, are routed to that phone, and are 
within times set by the ring schedule.
Calls routed to that phone that arrive outside the hours specified in the ring 
schedule go through to your Google Voice voicemail. Which, if you’ve chosen 
your settings to allow it, sends you an e-mail or even an SMS alert that you 
have a voicemail and sends you a transcription of the voicemail message, 
with the actual message attached as an MP3 file.

63
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
This feature is useful less often than you might think but is intensely useful 
when you need it. It’s useful less often than you might think because it 
doesn’t directly control the phone in question; it only controls calls routed 
to that phone through Google Voice. But it can be intensely useful for phones 
that are in shared-access areas or whose ringing might disturb people with 
the “wrong” calls if allowed to ring through at the “wrong” times.
	
However, we assert that this setting should be used carefully. It’s confusing to 
have calls to your Google Voice number ring a specific phone some of the 
time — and not others. It’s even more confusing that the controls for this are 
in a semi-hidden setting in your Google Voice Settings Web site.
Not only is it confusing; there’s a lot of potential for extra work here. You 
don’t always work the same days and hours. So the more carefully you set 
the ring schedule, the more likely you are to have to mess with it for even 
small changes in your actual schedule. For instance, the Ring Schedule set­
tings differentiate between weekdays and weekends, which fits most of us, 
until a national holiday, vacation day, or sick day comes along. And being 
early or late to work can play havoc with a custom schedule.
So we suggest you not set up a ring schedule for a phone at all unless you’re 
quite sure that you need one. Also be ready to tweak the schedule as your 
schedule, inevitably, shifts.
	
The reason this level of control might be important is for a phone that has 
its own voicemail. If you let calls to that phone ring through when you’re not 
around, they will be picked up by the phone’s voicemail, not in your Google 
Voice voicemail, with its centralization and cool features.
Follow these steps to set a ring schedule:
	
1.	If you’re not already on the Add a new phone page in the Phones tab 
under settings, then do the following: from your Google Voice page, 
click the Settings link on the left-hand side and the Phones tab. Click 
Edit for the phone whose schedule you want to change.
	
	The description you’ve created for the phone appears.
	
2.	Click the Show advanced settings link further down on the page.
	
	 The Ring Schedule section appears, as shown in Figure 3-10.
	
3.	For the Weekdays area, choose Always ring on weekdays, Never ring 
on weekdays, or Use custom schedule.
	
	 If you click Use custom schedule, the Do not ring phone from start time 
to end time option appears.

64
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
4.	If you’ve chosen Use custom schedule, set the time range in which the 
phone is not to ring. Use the Remove link and the Add time range link to 
set and manage multiple periods of blocking — for instance, to accom­
modate lunchtime.
	
	 This option gives you a lot of control but also a lot to remember. 
Consider writing down the settings you’ve entered someplace more vis­
ible and accessible than in this sub-sub-sub-menu of your Google Voice 
screen.
	
Figure 3-10: 
Manage 
the timing 
of “ringie-
dingies” 
from Google 
Voice to a

5.	Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for the Weekends area of the Ring Schedule.
	
	 Figure 3-11 shows a complex schedule typical for a business: calls 
allowed during working hours on weekdays and not at all on weekends.
	
	 If you’re open Saturday, for instance, you’ll need to change the settings 
in the Weekends area each Saturday to allow calls through on Saturday 
working hours but prevent all calls on Sunday. Similarly, you’ll need 
to make changes in the Weekdays area if you take a day off during the 
week.
	
6.	Click Save.
	
	 If you’re editing a phone that was already one of your verified Google 
Voice phones, you’ll be returned to the Settings area of your Google 
Voice Web page. If you’re setting up a phone that hasn’t yet been veri­
fied, you’ll be returned to Step 12 in the previous section to verify your 
phone.

65
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
7.	Test the ring schedule.
	
	 Try some calls within and outside of your ring schedule hours to make 
sure it works as intended.

Focusing On General/Default Settings
Some of the settings that you first set in this chapter can be purposefully 
used or overwritten for specific groups or contacts. (When you get calls from 
phone numbers that aren’t in your contacts, the settings you set here are 
used.)
Here’s how the settings you establish here interact with settings for specific 
groups and contacts:

66
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
✓	Which phones to ring. Which phones ring when someone calls you? Set 
it on the Phones tab of the Settings area for all incoming calls. This is 
called the Default for this setting by Google Voice. For a group, you can 
use the Default settings established here at the General level — meaning, 
the behavior for that group changes when you change the General 
setting — or use specific settings for the Group. For a contact, you can 
use the Group setting, which could be the Default setting or establish 
specific settings for the contact.
	
✓	Which voicemail greeting to use. This option is always selected from a 
pull-down list that you can edit wherever you see it at the overall level, 
for a group or a contact. You can add to the list, delete entries and so 
on. However, you can only specify the default greeting — the one used 
when a contact doesn’t have a setting specified for themselves or a 
group they belong to — from the General tab of the Settings area. You 
can set specific greetings for groups or individual contacts at those 
levels of setup.
	
✓	Whether to use call presentation. This option includes the ability for 
you to control specific calls based on the Caller ID and the caller’s name, 
which Google will speak for you, and to listen in on a voicemail message 
to decide whether to pick up the call. You can turn call presentation on 
or off in the General tab of the Settings area, as described here. For a 
group, Google Voice will then allow you to pick up this overall setting or 
override it for the group. For a specific contact, Google Voice will allow 
you to pick up the group setting or override it for that contact.
In choosing which phones to ring and whether to use call presentation, there 
are two main strategies you can use. If you use the Default setting for most or 
all of your groups, and the group setting for most, probably not all, of your 
contacts, the top-level setting established here has a lot of power. If you use a 
lot of specific group and individual contact settings, the top-level setting only 
reliably applies to calls that aren’t from phones that belong to your contacts.
As for voicemail greetings, the same applies; you can focus more on specific 
greetings per group and per contact, or on one overall greeting that’s easily 
changed.
The way settings cascade varies by setting and by the level you try to control 
it at. So take your time and think through how you want the global settings 
you choose here to work. If you set up your groups and contacts with spe­
cific, low-level settings, then want to make a quick change that applies right 
across Google Voice, you may have to do a fair amount of work to make the 
changes stick for all your contacts.

67
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Google Voice
	
With greetings, there’s a twist. You can create a voicemail greeting called, say, 
“Current” that you intend to use flexibly, and point to it from as many as possi­
ble of your groups and individual contacts. This greeting can include changing 
information such as your availability as you travel. By re-recording it, you will 
be giving callers the most recent information.
If you do this enough, it will be like an audio Twitter triggered (twigged?) 
by calling you. If you keep the messages up to date and use a bit of humor, 
people may be calling to hear your messages, not to speak to you!

Upgrading to Google Voice 
from GrandCentral
In This Chapter
▶	What’s Google doing with my GrandCentral account?
▶	Going over the differences
▶	Preparing to upgrade: Wait!
▶	Feeling the power
▶	Exploring Google Voice
I
f you’re a GrandCentral beta user, you’re one of the lucky few who have 
gotten to learn firsthand the power of managing your phones from 
one centralized tool. If you’re new to Google Voice and have no idea what 
GrandCentral is, don’t panic: you can skip this chapter altogether. (Or read it 
anyway, just to get a sense of the history of Google Voice.)
Still reading, GrandCentral folks? As early as March 2008, you may have noticed 
that you had the option to “upgrade” to Google Voice when you logged on to 
your GrandCentral account. What’s that all about? If you’ve already upgraded, 
you may have been wondering: that was quick; did I miss anything?
This chapter explains where GrandCentral came from, and what has changed 
since it was purchased and rebranded by Google as Google Voice. You find 
out the numerous benefits of upgrading as well as a few drawbacks.
Before you make the transition, there are a few things you should know, but 
don’t worry; if you’re savvy enough to use GrandCentral in the first place, the 
upgrade is a cinch. After the process is all said and done, this chapter delineates 
all the new things you can do with your Google-fied account.
	
When you transition to Google Voice, you may lose access to GrandCentral; 
different people’s experiences seem to vary. Neither your contacts nor your 
voicemails and recordings are transferred, but you can move them over with 
the steps we recommend. But to be careful, you need to do this before you 
upgrade; steps for doing this are given below.

70
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Making Special Considerations for 
Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada
Google Voice comes with a few geographical caveats. If you call Alaska, 
Hawaii, and/or Canada a lot, you’ve enjoyed the fact that GrandCentral made 
these calls for free; with Google Voice, they initially cost 4¢ a minute for 
Alaska, 2¢ a minute for Hawaii, and 1¢ a minute for Canada. However, the 
charge for calls to Canada was removed in summer 2009.
	
So for making calls to Alaska and Hawaii, you save money by sticking with 
GrandCentral as long as you can. (Missing out on Google Voice’s cool new 
features is a tough tradeoff!) This consideration is especially important if you 
live in either state. The hassle of adding money to your account to be ready 
to make such calls may be a bigger worry than the actual cost, but it’s a new 
hassle and expense with Google Voice compared to GrandCentral.
	
GrandCentral didn’t give out GrandCentral phone numbers with area codes for 
Alaska, Hawaii, or Canada. But GrandCentral does allow calls placed to an area 
code in the lower 48 states to be forwarded through to phones with Alaska, 
Hawaii, and Canada area codes, and at no cost as well.
Google Voice does not allow phones with Alaska, Hawaii or Canada area 
codes to be added to the phones that can receive calls. In the upgrade, your 
existing phones are “grandfathered in,” but you can’t add new ones. This is 
the same treatment as people outside the U.S. receive, and not very welcome. 
Google has discussed extending the free call area to Alaska, Hawaii, and 
Canada, and offering area codes from these areas as well.
	
If you’re based in Alaska, Hawaii, or Canada, add all the phones you can think 
of from these areas to your GrandCentral account before you upgrade. Then 
you can continue using them to receive calls placed to your Google Voice 
number.
What about the maple leaf crew?
Canadians share the same international calling code designation as 
Americans — 1— () and are thoroughly integrated into a unified North 
American calling scheme. But some new services “leaf” out Canadians.
GrandCentral was a partial exception. It didn’t give out phone numbers with 
Canadian area codes, only U.S. ones. So Canadian users were reluctant to 
give out their Google Voice numbers (with the U.S. area codes) to Canadian 
business colleagues, friends, and family because calling it cost extra. The 
numbers were great to give to U.S. contacts though.

71
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
GrandCentral did allow phones with Canadian area codes to be added to a 
GrandCentral account. So calls to your GrandCentral number would ring your 
Canadian phones, at no charge.
At the time of this writing, Google Voice is not as flexible. Canadian phone 
numbers that are already in a GrandCentral account are grandfathered into 
the upgrade; they can still be used with Google Voice. But you can’t add more 
phones with Canadian (or any other non-U.S.) number to the service.
So for Canadians, sticking with GrandCentral is the more flexible option at 
the time of this writing — though it means missing out on all the great Google 
Voice features. Check Google Voice Help online at www.google.com/
support/voice/ to see if the situation has changed.
Baked Alaska – and boiling Hawaiians
In 2008, in an historic first, America finally elected a president from a group 
of Americans that had long battled for proper recognition, that had sometimes 
felt slighted, left out, or ignored in America’s ever-evolving story.
Yes, in 2008, America finally elected its first Hawaii-born President.
But Alaska and Hawaii are still left out from full and free participation in an 
important new American experience: the use of Google Voice.
With GrandCentral, calls to Alaska and Hawaii were free. Now they’re 2¢ a 
minute to Hawaii and 4¢ a minute to Alaska.
No Alaska or Hawaii area codes are available as phone numbers from Google 
Voice, just as there weren’t with GrandCentral. That means that if you’re 
from one of those states, you have to live with a phone number that has an 
out-of-state area code. But you also can’t have calls made to Google Voice 
ring through to your Alaskan or Hawaiian phones.
As long as Google Voice continues to charge extra for Hawaii and Alaska 
calls, and GrandCentral is still available and doesn’t charge extra, people who 
call to and from Hawaii and Alaska will have lower costs with GrandCentral, 
but more features with Google Voice. A tough choice!
Discovering How Google Got Your 
GrandCentral Account?
GrandCentral was founded in 2005 by Craig Walker and Vincent Paquet, a 
couple of seasoned geeks with a great idea for controlling phone lines using 

72
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
an Internet-based tool. They had previously started a service called DialPad 
and sold it to Yahoo! DialPad became Yahoo! Voice, a service that allows 
users to make calls over the Internet from computer to computer.
After DialPad, Walker and Paquet had a fabulous new idea. They realized 
that making phone calls over the Internet wasn’t so great if you had to use a 
computer to do it. They envisioned a Web service that let you centralize all 
the phone lines in your life, and control them all from anywhere using a Web 
interface but still let you make calls from your phones instead of the com­
puter. That idea became GrandCentral.
Sometime between 2005 and 2008, you probably heard about GrandCentral 
and decided to give it the old college try; after all, it was free. Like a few thou­
sand other early adopters, you got an e-mail invitation once you signed up, 
and away you went.
And you were lucky. GrandCentral had a lot of breakthrough features, making 
it amazingly useful for a free, 1.0 product. And the interface was robust and 
well-executed; nearly everything it did, it did well.
Google bought GrandCentral in July of 2007 for a cool $95 million. Great, you 
thought: GrandCentral is now backed by one of the wealthiest and most inno­
vative tech companies on the planet. And you waited for terrific new Google-y 
features to pop up. And then you waited more.
Gradually, your waiting turned into despair. Was Google ignoring their acqui­
sition? Maybe you read the howls of abandonment from GrandCentral users 
in the site’s support forums. Maybe you noticed that GrandCentral’s staff 
stopped responding. Woe became you.
Then that gleeful day arrived: March 11, 2009, when Google finally re-
launched GrandCentral as Google Voice. They had been secretly working on 
the project all along. You instantly forgave their inconsideration.
Better yet, Google Voice was only open to a select few press and other insid­
ers plus existing GrandCentral users like you, who were allowed to upgrade 
for months before Google Voice was opened to the public. Google Voice 
numbers were selling on eBay for hundreds of dollars. You went from being a 
technology orphan to being part of a small, envied elite overnight.
You can find many forums for discussing GrandCentral and Google Voice. 
Here are a few highlights that might be interesting to you before you upgrade:
	
✓	Export your GrandCentral phonebook before upgrading; import it first 
thing after upgrading.
	
✓	Google says you can still access your GrandCentral account to get old 
voicemails, but some people have found that not to be the case.
	
✓	A few people like the old interface better, at least on first exposure to 
the new one. Most like the new one better.

73
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
And that’s most of it. Much less static than usual for any kind of big upgrade.
Understanding the Differences
	
Even before you upgrade, there’s good news. With Google behind the service, 
you may feel a lot more confident in using it. And GrandCentral’s revenue 
plans are kicked into touch; whatever Google eventually does to make money 
from the service, it’s likely to cost you less than the $14.99 a month that 
GrandCentral planned to charge.
In pain? Information is the answer
A few former GrandCentral users have had 
more brickbats than bouquets for Google Voice. 
Here are some concerns that were raised —
and the answers:
	✓	Where are all 100 names, addresses, phone 
numbers that I had in my GrandCentral 
Account? 
	
	 It’s pretty easy to export your GrandCentral 
contacts and import them into Google 
Voice, as described in this chapter. The 
trick is that Google says you can do this 
before or after the upgrade, but some 
users report not being able to get back into 
GrandCentral after upgrading. So export 
before you upgrade to make sure you don’t 
have problems.
	✓	Why are all my friends and family now 
being asked to “say your name” on every 
single phone call? (GrandCentral let me 
turn that “bad feature” off.)
	
	 You can turn this off in Google Voice, too, 
by disabling Call Screening in the Settings 
menu: for all callers, for groups of callers 
and for specific callers one at a time; see 
the next chapter.
	✓	I have to pay for every text message Google 
Voice is now sending me. (How do I turn 
that off?)
	
	 This person is now seeing the text mes­
sages that were simply lost when they were 
on GrandCentral; losing them is worse than 
getting them, we think! But there is cost 
and interruption involved if the texts come 
through to your phone.
You can turn off text message forwarding in 
Google Voice so the messages only show up 
in your Google Voice Inbox and not on your 
phone. But you can only do this for all text mes­
sages on one phone at a time, by turning off the 
“receive SMS on this phone” feature for each 
of your cell phones. Or you can block all input 
from a given user. You can’t turn text message 
forwarding on and off by group or by individual 
caller, which would be a good thing.
A very few have even asked to be converted 
back to GrandCentral! But if the upgrade makes 
you nervous, just be patient — the only real 
“gotcha”s in the upgrade are the potential loss 
of contacts and messages, which we show you 
how to work around in this chapter; and the 
loss of RingShare, which is sad for some but 
not likely to be a stopper for anyone.
And, in case you were wondering, there’s no 
way to get back to GrandCentral after you’ve 
upgraded to Google Voice.

74
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
As for the upgrade itself, there isn’t much bad news. Almost everything that 
GrandCentral offered is still there in Google Voice: one number, a unified 
voice mailbox, control from the Web, the ability to manage incoming calls 
including blocking spam, and listening in on incoming calls.
You still get free domestic long distance calls and e-mail notifications of 
voicemails, with a link to the audio file attached. You can customize voice­
mail messages and divert calls temporarily.
	
There’s really only one missing feature: RingShare. That’s the ability to link a 
custom MP3 file to replace the normal ringing phone sound. (Like a custom 
ringtone but for your callers to hear, not you.)
RingShare is just gone, and there’s no sign it will ever return. 
Web call buttons are still available in Google Voice, but your GrandCentral 
ones won’t survive the transition; you need to replace them with new, Google 
Voice buttons. And that’s about it on the minus side.
The first change you notice after you upgrade is the look. The interface has 
changed considerably, and for the better. Gone are the clumsy menus and 
antiquated tools of GrandCentral, replaced by Google’s lightweight and quick-
loading interface.
Figure 4-1 shows the opening screen of GrandCentral. Figure 4-2 shows the 
opening screen of Google Voice. You can see from a quick look that there’s 
more going on in Google Voice — yet it looks cleaner.
	
Figure 4-1:

its day.

 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
	
Figure 4-2: 
Google

callers and

your 
voicemail 
Inbox.
	
The new interface puts the voicemail Inbox at center stage, and everything 
else in a pane on the left-hand side.
If you use other services such as Gmail or Google Docs, Google Voice will feel 
like home. (In fact, better than home; the Google Voice interface is easier and 
cleaner than, say, Gmail.) If you’re not an experienced Google account user, 
you can quickly get used to the new way of things.
And the transition is not purely cosmetic. Google has added a handful of fan­
tastic new features (what you can do) and functionality (the way you do it). 
We count ten new features that can save you time and money and make your 
telephone life more convenient:
	
✓	Cheap international calls: All the money-saving potential of Skype and 
its competitors, such as Google Talk, and then some — France and 
China, for two examples, are just 2¢ a minute. And it’s available where 
you really need it: on your phones. More on this in Chapter 7.
	
✓	SMS text messaging: This was the biggest missing feature in 
GrandCentral and the biggest “Yes!” in Google Voice for GrandCentral 
users. You can receive texts to your Google Voice number and have 
them forwarded to your cell phone — rather than having them disap­
pear into the ether, as happened with GrandCentral. You can send texts 
from your Google Voice number, too. Unfortunately, you can’t send 
international texts.
	
✓	SMS message logging: Text messages are saved in your Web account 
forever, where you can review them, search them — it is a Google 
service, after all — forward them, and so on.

76
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
✓	Voicemail transcription: This is shown in Figure 4-3. You’re used to 
GrandCentral’s Inbox list of calls and e-mail alerts for voicemails. Now, 
every e-mail alert has a transcription attached to it, so long as the caller 
said something more than a grunt. It’s automated and a bit rough — 
there is rarely any punctuation — but especially useful for picking out 
phone numbers that are contained in a voicemail, since Google’s tran­
scription engine seems to identify those very accurately. However, tran­
scription makes rambling voicemails look even sillier than they sound. 
Still, voicemail transcripts make it easier to know how urgent it is that 
you respond and help you to handle many of your voicemails via e-mail.
	
✓	Free and easy conference calling: Conference calling for most people 
is expensive and difficult, sometimes even impossible to do when you 
need it. Not with Google Voice, especially when you add the advantage 
of free domestic and cheap international calls to reach your conferees.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Google 
Voice 
transcribes 
each 
voicemail 
automati-
cally.
	
	
✓	Easy call recording: You can record calls at any point; your caller gets a 
warning message and then you’re off and running. A link to the recording 
is e-mailed to you after the call. Especially useful for conference calls.
	
✓	GOOG-411 integration: Now you can call Google’s information line 
directly from Google Voice to make a verbal request for the locations 
and phone numbers of local businesses.
	
✓	Calls from the Inbox: You can now make calls directly from your voice­
mail inbox, making call-backs easier. You can also embed voicemails 
or recorded calls in your blog or Web site for all the world to listen to, 
though you may want to get permission first.
	
✓	GoogleVoice Mobile: A much better looking and more robust mobile 
site for Google Voice control. Works on any Web-enabled phone.
	
✓	Dialers: A dialer is a cell phone software application, or app, that runs 
directly on the phone rather than through a Web site. Google is actively 
developing dialers of its own and supporting developers in creating dial­
ers as well. The result is a richer array of choices than was available for 
GrandCentral.

77
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
The Google in Google Voice is a gift that will keep on giving. Not just in the 
service itself, with its cleaner interface and new features, but in integration.
Google Voice is already especially easy to use with Gmail, as we describe in 
Chapter 11. And the dialer for Google Android is particularly nice, as we describe 
in Chapter 8. But the key point is that with Google behind it, Google Voice is 
likely to be integrated with many more Google and non-Google products.
More subtly, Google Voice will also be much more acceptable to businesses 
than a minor-league product from an independent startup like GrandCentral 
ever was, because of the assurance that the behemoth search company will 
always be around to stand behind its products.
Barriers to entry
The biggest barrier to entry for Google Voice, as for GrandCentral, still has 
to do with dealing with a new number. This is really two problems: training 
people to use your new number and the fact that they keep seeing your old 
number after you’ve moved.
The second problem is much easier to manage now. GrandCentral lacked 
SMS support, so texts had to go to and from your “real” cell phone number. 
Google Voice has SMS support, which is a big plus in any event. And if you’re 
dutiful about dialing in to Google Voice before calling or texting out, you can 
maintain the impression that your GV number is your “real” number.
But dealing with a new number is still a hassle. What’s needed is the ability 
to port an existing cell phone number to Google Voice. Google is actually 
promising this capability for the near future — but you can’t be certain it will 
happen until it does.
When people can move their cell phone numbers to Google Voice, expect a 
surge of adoption. Google Voice will become a great way to save money with 
and manage the cell phone-based relationships people already have.
Et tu, iPhone?
If you’ve been using a GrandCentral dialer on your smartphone, it will still 
work after you upgrade to Google Voice. Better yet, you’ll be able to take 
advantage of some of the more full-featured dialers that Google and other 
third party-developers are developing specifically for Google Voice.
You can find out more about how to integrate your smartphone into your 
Google Voice life in Part III of this book.

Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Before You Hurry Up, Wait
You probably want to upgrade from GrandCentral to Google Voice sooner 
rather than later. You may well be forced to do it eventually, if Google closes 
off GrandCentral. And in any event, it makes sense to start getting the advan­
tages sooner rather than later.
But before you upgrade, consider the following issues:
	
✓	Moving your GrandCentral contacts to Google Voice.
	
✓	Keeping your GrandCentral voicemails available after the move to 
Google Voice.
	
✓	Creating a Gmail account, if you don’t already have one, as a preferred 
home for the flurry of e-mails and transcripts that Google Voice will 
produce.
Both GrandCentral and Google Voice are quite different from your previous 
way of using your phone. It’s best to stop investing in optimizing a depre­
cated platform, as the HTML people put it, and start putting your efforts into 
the one that has a long and bright future in front of it.
And, given that you’re going to move, you don’t want to spend a lot of time 
after the changeover reassembling contact information and worrying about 
old voicemails.
We take each issue — contacts, voicemails, and Gmail — in turn, telling 
you what to do before you upgrade, as well as what to do if you’ve already 
upgraded and are having problems.
Creating a Gmail account
If you’re preparing to upgrade from GrandCentral to Google Voice, now is a 
really good time to create a Gmail account. You may even want to create a 
specific Gmail account just for your Google Voice messages and voicemails.
We go through the reasons for this in Chapter 11. What we can address here 
is, why now?
When you start using Google Voice, you’re going to associate it with an e-mail 
account. You want all your notifications and transcripts from Google Voice 
over time to be in the same e-mail account where you can find them easily.
And you want that e-mail account to be flexible, easy to use for forwarding, 
and easy to integrate with tools such as Outlook and Apple Mail. You also 

79
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
want it to be well integrated with Google Voice — now and in the future — 
easy to search and free. Gmail is the natural choice.
So seriously consider taking the time now to create a Gmail account, learn a 
bit about Gmail — the high points are covered in Chapter 11 — and use it as 
your Google Voice e-mail account right from the start.
Keeping contact(s) with GrandCentral
Managing contacts seems trivial, but it’s actually one of the great issues in 
computing today. People expect to sign on once to their computer, if at all, and 
have access to all their programs, files, and Web sites. Similarly, they expect to 
have one set of contact information for each person important to them.
Microsoft Outlook, which is a bit of a dinosaur, keeps a fan base of many 
millions largely because of its solid base of contact management capability 
across e-mail, meetings, and phone number and address information. Apple 
and Google are each trying to pull off the same thing.
So getting your contacts from GrandCentral into Google Voice (where you 
can integrate them with other Google services, with Outlook, or Apple 
services as well) is a big deal.
	
When you export your GrandCentral contacts, group information is lost. So 
you either have to deal with all your contacts in one big blob or use the Tip in 
Step 3 below to work around the problem.
If you are about to upgrade, or you’ve already upgraded and still have access 
to your GrandCentral account, follow these steps to export your contacts:
	
1.	Sign into GrandCentral.
	
2.	Click the Inbox tab.
	
	 Your GrandCentral Inbox appears, perhaps the last time you’ll see it!
	
3.	Click the Address Book tab.
	
	 Your Address Book appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
	
	 Consider going into each group and exporting your contacts one group 
at a time, so you can import them that way, too.
	
4.	Click the Export link.
	
	 A dialog appears asking what file format the exported addresses should 
be stored in.

80
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
Figure 4-4: 
Say good-
bye to your 
grand, cen-
tral address 
book.
	
	
5.	Click the Import mail and contacts button.
	
	 A dialog box requesting the e-mail address appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.
	
6.	Click the CSV File button.
	
	 A dialog box appears to allow you to choose where to save the file.
	
	 Choosing CSV File exports your file as a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) 
file, which you can import into Google Voice. You can also make changes 
to it in a word processor or spreadsheet program such as Microsoft 
Word or Excel, or their Google Apps counterparts.
	
7.	Save the file in a location in which you can readily find it for importing.
	
	 We recommend that you save it to your desktop so you can easily find it.
If you’ve already upgraded, but can still get into GrandCentral, you can follow 
the steps above at any time. However, the longer you wait, adding contacts to 
Google Voice as you go, the more risk you have of duplicate contacts.
	
If you’ve already upgraded, and can’t get into GrandCentral, you’re probably 
stuck recreating contacts in Google Voice, unless you have your contacts 
stored in Outlook, Apple Address Book, or another program. One quick work­
around is to e-mail your key contacts and ask them to either e-mail you their 
contact information or call you. Doing either makes it easy for you to create a 
new contact for them in Google Voice.
Saving your GrandCentral 
voicemails and recordings
Part of the advantage of using GrandCentral was to centralize your voice­
mail messages and to get them onto your computer where you could deal 
with them more easily. Another part was the ability to record a call during 

81
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
the call. And part of the advantage of Google Voice is that it continues the 
GrandCentral capabilities and adds voicemail transcripts. (We’re still waiting 
for transcripts of call recordings!)
	
If you haven’t upgraded to Google Voice yet — or if you have done so and still 
have access to GrandCentral — you can take full advantage of Google Voice’s 
new capabilities. First, you have to arrange to export links to your key voice­
mail messages from GrandCentral. Then upgrade to Google Voice.
We’ve incorporated this trick into the steps for getting your GrandCentral 
voicemails into Google Voice:
	
1.	Sign into GrandCentral.
	
2.	Click the Inbox tab.
	
3.	Click the Messages link.
	
	 A list of your messages appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.
	
	 Next is the most important step, and it has to do with destroying infor­
mation rather than saving it!
	
4.	Delete all your unnecessary voicemails. Capture any needed To Do 
items and contact information first. Leave only voicemails that have 
important information contained inside them.
	
	 As shown by the transcript feature in Google Voice, sound files are 
a terrible place to lock up important information. Liberate yourself 
from them!
	
5.	Now only your critical messages remain. Click a message, then click 
the Forward tab. Fill in your own e-mail address in the To Email field. 
Fill in the note with pertinent information about the call as you can. 
Then click Send.
	
	 An e-mail message is sent with a link back to the voicemail message. The 
link works even if you are unable to access your GrandCentral account 
after you upgrade.
	
	 Nothing is forever — don’t count on your GrandCentral voicemails 
always being there. Deal with them one way or another, including bring­
ing them into Google Voice as described below.
	
6.	Repeat for your remaining messages.
	
What if you have already upgraded to Google Voice and can’t get into your 
GrandCentral account? If you can find the e-mail notification that GrandCentral 
sent you, the link in that will still work.
But if you do have access, it’s easier to use the systematic method in the 
steps above — getting rid of the chaff first and tipping yourself off to what’s 
in the remaining messages — than to go through potentially hundreds of noti­
fications to find the few voicemails that you want to keep.

82
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
Making the Move
Actually upgrading from GrandCentral to Google Voice is simple.
First, you need to receive an invitation to upgrade. That invitation appears 
in a box at the top of your GC account when you log in. An announcement 
of Google Voice is shown in Figure 4-5. At the time of this writing, the vast 
majority of GrandCentral users have received their invitation — but a few 
haven’t.
If you have an invitation — and you’ve exported your contacts, forwarded 
a link to any old voicemails, and (optionally) opened a Gmail account, as 
described above — you’re ready!
Follow these steps to move from GrandCentral to Google Voice:
	
1.	If you don’t have a Google Account, use the instructions in Chapter 11 
to create one.
	
	 All you need is an e-mail address of some sort. We recommend that you 
also create a Gmail account, as described in Chapter 11, as it’s very 
useful for handling Google Voice e-mail messages, even if you don’t use 
it for anything else.
	
Figure 4-5: 
The invite 
can be an 
annoyance, 
especially 
if you don’t 
get one.
	

83
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
	
2.	Sign into your Google account at Google.com.
	
	 Sign in to your Google Account using the e-mail address you want to use 
with Google Voice. This is important; you can’t change it later.
	
3.	In a new browser window, sign into GrandCentral.
	
	 The message inviting you to upgrade appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
	
4.	Click the link in the invitation message labeled Yes, Upgrade me.
	
	 You are asked to enter your password.
	
5.	Type your password.
	
	 After a brief pause, you’ll be upgraded. The Google Voice screen will 
appear.
	
	 Congratulations! You’re now a Google Voice user.
	
6.	Bookmark your Google Voice page in your browser. You can get to 
Google Voice directly by going to http://google.com/voice.
	
7.	Check whether you can still access your GrandCentral account.
	
	 Try signing into GrandCentral and see if you can still access your 
account. If you can, that’s good news, in case there’s anything you still 
want to retrieve. But it may not be there forever, so get any data you 
need out sooner rather than later.
Rerecording your name and greeting
	
You have to rerecord your name and greeting after you move to Google Voice. 
Do this quickly, before someone calls you!
Chapter 3 describes how to do this, if it’s not enough like GrandCentral to be 
easy. You may also want to look through the rest of Chapter 3 to be reminded 
of other settings that are the same between the two systems, but whose 
details may have faded for you since you first set up Google Voice.
You also have to change any custom settings and recreate any WebCall buttons.
Importing your GrandCentral contacts
After you’re in Google Voice, the next step to take — before you even take a 
look around — is to import your contacts. Having your contacts in Google 
Voice bring it to life and make it useful right away.

84
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
You want to import your contacts from GrandCentral first because they’re 
phone number-centric. You may well have other contacts that you can import 
later, which are e-mail-centric or balanced among different contact methods. 
You want the phone number-centric ones first as a base in Google Voice.
Google Voice allows you to integrate different contact records for the same 
person fairly easily. After you do this, the combined information becomes 
part of your Google Contacts. You can use these across various Google 
services such as Gmail and combine them with other programs, such as 
Microsoft Outlook or Apple’s Address Book.
Follow these steps to import contacts you exported from GrandCentral:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site and click Contacts in the left-hand 
menu.
	
	 The Contacts page appears.
	
2.	Click the Import link in the upper-right corner of the page.
	
3.	Click the Browse button to find the CSV file from GrandCentral to import.
	
	 The Choose File to Import dialog appears.
	
4.	Find the file you exported from GrandCentral and click Open.
	
	 The file path appears before the Browse button, as shown in Figure 4-6.
	
Figure 4-6: 
Time to 
bring in your 
not-so-long-
lost data.
	
	
5.	To also add the contacts to a specific group, click the checkbox and 
chose the group name from the pull-down menu, or specify that they’ll 
be placed in a new group.
	
	 The contacts are placed in the All Contacts list in any event, from which 
you can place them into specific groups relevant to Google Voice. They 

85
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
will only all be placed directly into a specific group if you click the 
checkbox here.
	
6.	Click Import to import the contacts.
	
	 The contacts are brought into Google. Some contacts may not be 
brought in; if so, one or more error messages will appear to describe the 
problem(s).
For instructions on how to export and import other contacts, see Chapter 5.
	
If you have more than 3,000 contacts in a CSV file, the additional contacts 
won’t import. Open the CSV file in a word processor or spreadsheet and save 
it as two or more separate CSV files, each with fewer than 3,000 contacts.
Importing your voicemails and recordings
Now you may have taken our advice and dealt with your old voicemails and 
recordings in GrandCentral, then deleted them. But perhaps you had a pre­
cious few you just had to forward to yourself, or perhaps you had so many 
that you had to export them all so you could deal with the lot of them later.
So now you have a few, or a lot of, e-mails with links to GrandCentral voicemail 
messages and recordings. And now that you’ve upgraded to Google Voice, you 
may or may not be able to get back into GrandCentral to access them.
	
At some point, GrandCentral may become permanently unavailable. And 
perhaps at the same time, or perhaps at a different time, your GrandCentral 
voicemail and recording files may become permanently unavailable. And deal­
ing with old voicemails that aren’t in your one and only, unified Google Voice 
voicemail inbox is a pain in any event.
So the sooner you deal with your voicemail and recording files, the better. 
You can either deal with them as e-mails or, through an admittedly slow, 
clumsy and error-prone process, bring them all the way into Google Voice.
To deal with them as e-mails, create a folder, or, in Google Voice, a label, and 
store all the emails with links to voicemails and recordings there. But remem­
ber, they’re never safe from the original GrandCentral file being deleted.
But you may want to get the voicemail message or recording fully into Google 
Voice. This may especially be true if it has sentimental value or needs to be 
shared, as a recording, with others. So follow these steps to bring the mes­
sage fully into Google Voice:
	
1.	Open the e-mail with the voicemail or recording linked to it.

86
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
2.	For a voicemail message, use a nearby phone to call your Google Voice 
(was GrandCentral) number. Let the call go through to voicemail.
	
3.	For longer recordings, you need two phones (as recording a call only 
works on incoming calls). Call from one phone to Google Voice. Pick 
up from a phone that the call rings through to. Press 4 to start record­
ing the call.
	
4.	When Google Voice starts recording, click the link in the e-mail to 
play the voicemail or recording back. Turn the volume up loud.
	
5.	Play the message or recording through. Hang up.
	
	 Google Voice stores the voicemail or recording and sends you an e-mail 
with a link to the voicemail or recording.
	
	 For a voicemail, Google Voice also includes a transcript. (The audio 
quality of the audio file and the accuracy of the transcript may not be 
very good because of the convoluted playback and recording process.)
You’ve now imported the voicemail message or recording fully into Google 
Voice. You can manage it just as you would have in GrandCentral, but with 
the added benefit (for voicemails) of a transcript.
Touring Google Voice
Much is the same in Google Voice as in GrandCentral, and you may not want 
to wade through this whole book trying to figure out what’s different. Here 
are a few highlights.
In keeping with those priorities, logging into your shiny new Google Voice 
account presents you with the voicemail Inbox at center stage, and the rest 
of your stuff in a pane on the left-hand side. Go ahead and feel your way 
around. The first thing you notice: it takes fewer clicks to get to the features 
you want, because almost everything is laid out in one of the two new nav 
bars at the top and left of the screen.
As you can see every time you open Google Voice, Google has re-structured 
the interface to give real primacy to voicemail messages. They’ve assumed 
(and probably rightly) that your favorite things about GrandCentral included 
its ability to screen callers, send certain callers straight to voicemail, and 
record calls into your voicemail inbox.
Not only is getting around within your account easier, but getting around 
Google’s suite of services is easier, too. Just like Gmail, Calendar, Reader, and 
all of Google’s other tools, Voice has been blessed by Google’s application 
nav bar at the very top of the window, letting you breezily switch between, 
say, your e-mail and your Voice account with one simple click.

87
 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
Like Gmail, Google Voice relies on the “axis” style interface: two perpen­
dicular toolbars on the top and left of the screen. Google has stuck all of the 
action-verb buttons — Call, SMS, Archive, Report Spam, Delete, and so on —
in a bar atop the screen. The pane on the left is reserved for various folders 
such as your voice and text message inboxes and your call logs.
Also notice a little balance-counter for the money you have in the account. 
Don’t freak out—Google Voice is still free, and so are domestic calls. The bal­
ance counter is just for international calling, which requires you to pay.
If you’re familiar with Gmail, the blue action bar across the top of the inbox 
works basically the same way. And just like Gmail, you can now bumble 
around Voice with more than 20 keyboard commands.
The important ones all start with typing the letter g, (as in “go to”). They let 
you navigate around the folders in the left-hand pane. Just type g and the first 
letter of the folder you want (v for voicemail, s for starred, and so on) and 
Voice will switch to that screen. For more on these shortcuts, see Chapter 7.
Finding the new stuff
Where are the cool new features? Many of them “just happen”; the rest are 
seamlessly integrated into the Google Voice interface, as they should be. 
There are no flashing signs saying “New feature here.” You can see some of 
the new features in Figure 4-7.
So here’s where the new features show up:
	
✓	Discounts on international calls is something that “just happens”; 
you place the call and get the cheaper rate. For a list of rates, click the 
Rates link at the bottom of the pane on the left.
	
✓	You no longer add credit to your account by using PayPal — you use 
Google Checkout. Each of which, for one reason or another, has pas­
sionate fans and detractors. (Don’t worry; they both work fine.) To add 
credit to your account, click the Add Credit link right next to the Rates 
link on the bottom left of the pane on the left of your screen and follow 
the instructions, as described in Chapter 7.
	
✓	Conference calling is done by pressing keys during a call. Same with 
recording an incoming call. Check the Cheat Sheet at the front of the 
book for details. Recordings are e-mailed to you automatically at the end 
of the call.
	
✓	Voicemail transcription is automatic. Google Voice gives you its best 
shot at a transcription with every voicemail message alert.

88
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
Figure 4-7: 
Can you find 
the key 
features?
	
	
✓	SMS text messaging — it is easier to receive than to give on this one. SMS 
text messages you receive just show up in your Inbox, and you can deal 
with them just like e-mail messages now. And you can send SMS text 
messages from within Google Voice Web site without using up your cell 
allowance.
	
	However, SMSing from your mobile phone requires you to use a dialer 
and dial into Google Voice before sending the text. (So it’s your Google 
Voice number that the recipient responds to.) A dialer application helps 
(see Part III), but it’s still extra work.
	
✓	Contact management is just better. It’s easier to create, edit, and merge 
contacts, and your contacts are automatically part of your Google 
contacts.
	
✓	GOOG-411 integration is automatic. You can easily call Goog411 to get 
phone numbers and locations of businesses from within Google Voice.
	
✓	Making calls from your voicemail Inbox makes callbacks easier. Just 
call the number while in your Inbox. Both your main phone and the 
number you’re calling will ring.
	
✓	Embedding voicemails or recorded calls in your blog or Web site 
takes just a couple of steps. See Chapter 6 for more information.
	
✓	Using the GoogleVoice Mobile Web site on your Web-enabled cell 
phone is a snap. Gp to the Web site voice.google.com/m. Details 
on how to use it for different phones are given in Part III. Choosing and 
using dialers for different phones is in Part III as well.

 Chapter 4: Upgrading to Google Voice from GrandCentral
Finding more
After you’ve identified the “nuggets” of brand new features, there is also 
some news about the way things are organized.
Head over to your Contacts menu on the left. The new three-pane view does 
away with GrandCentral’s cumbersome list format, and lets you create and 
manage groups of contacts (friends, family, coworkers) more easily. Note 
that Google has also automatically imported your Gmail contacts into the All 
Contacts heading, so that you can add the people you e-mail most into your 
Google Voice list.
Google has also taken the liberty of grouping the people you talk to most via 
e-mail and Voice into a handy Most Contacted list. If you care to cut down 
that list to a useful size, try the Suggested Contacts button in the right-most 
pane. It creates a new group of people you talk to frequently via e-mail, but 
who aren’t in your Voice contacts list yet. Find duplicates? Check the boxes 
next to them, and notice that the right-most pane allows you to combine 
them into a single contact, with all the information from both. See Chapter 3 
for more about working with Contacts.
Note that calling and texting new numbers is easier than before, too. Just 
click Call or SMS at the top left of the blue action bar, or type c or s from the 
keyboard, and enter the number you want to contact.
Another great little feature: the blue Tip bar at the bottom of your voicemail 
inbox. We cover everything you need to know about using Voice throughout 
this book, but the tip bar serves as a good reminder.
After you’ve gotten a good feel for the new layout, head up to the top right-
hand corner of your screen and click the Settings tab, as shown in Figure 4-8. 
Go over all your preferences — a couple of them will be new — and make 
sure you’ve got things set the way you like.
The Settings tab is also the place you can change the way GV treats groups of 
contacts — specifically, which voicemail message they hear, and how their 
call is presented to you.
In Settings, you also notice the Call Widgets tab. If you had a Call Me button 
from GrandCentral embedded in your blog or Web site and you’d like to 
upgrade it to a Google Voice-branded button, you can do that here.

90
Part I: Setting Up Google Voice 
	
Figure 4-8: 
Check your 
settings, old 
and new.
	
Finally, Settings is also the place to add money to your Google Voice account 
for international calling.
Like something about the new interface? Hate something? Use the Feedback 
link at the top-right corner of your screen (next to Settings) to tell Google just 
what you like or dislike about the upgrade. Do it now, while the differences 
are still fresh in your mind. Google is known for listening to its users, and as 
a GrandCentral upgrader, you have a special perspective that can help them 
improve the service.
Now get out there and do some calling!

Part II
Maximizing 
Your Voice

In this part . . .
You want to get the most out of Google Voice while 
spending the least money. We show you how to do 
that across the many settings and options that you can 
adjust and take advantage of while using Google Voice.

C
ommunications is all about people — and Google Voice is all about 
giving you more ways to be in touch. It fills in the gaps between e-mail, 
your computer, and your phones.
But getting the full advantage of all this integration means importing contacts 
into Google Voice and managing them. Indeed, some of the power of Google 
Voice comes from putting people into groups, then managing those groups as 
a whole. But the groups only make sense in Google Voice, so managing them 
has to be done there as well.
This chapter spells out the easiest ways to get the most power out of Google 
Voice with the least work. As with the settings in the last chapter, you must 
do a small chunk of work up front, plus minor ongoing efforts, with the right 
up-front steps making maintenance easier. In this chapter, we show you how 
to do things right the first time and give you an easy-to-use reference source 
when you need to make changes in the future.
	
When you import data into Google, the imported information overwrites any 
existing contacts that have the same e-mail address. So, we recommend that 
you import early to avoid the frustration of putting new information directly 
into a Google contact, then overwriting it with older, imported information.
Importing Contacts into Google
People have long used PCs to bridge the gap between business and calling 
cards, paper address books, printed phone books, scraps of paper, and their 
phones. For example, one of the authors (Smith) used an early Macintosh to 
keep a very tightly formatted list of key contacts that he could easily print 

94
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
out, fold up, and put in his wallet. (Where it rapidly became dog-eared from 
frequent use.)
Now PCs and mobile phones are so useful for capturing and storing data that 
people tend to have a proliferation of contact information. Beginning to use 
Google Voice gives you a good opportunity to bring a lot of it together.
Google Voice erodes the barrier between e-mail and telephone communi­
cation, so your Google Voice contact information should be quite robust, 
including at least a person’s name, e-mail addresses) and all of a person’s 
phone numbers.
Your Google Voice contacts are actually contacts that work right across 
Google — in Gmail, in Google Calendar, and more. If you only use Google 
Voice, that’s fine, but if you use other Google tools as well, you leverage the 
work you do in each one across all of them.
The idea is for Google to be able to suck in all the contact information you 
already have online and also make it easy for you to enter offline information 
as well. You can then share the result with all your other programs.
Using more Google tools also help you if you’re a smartphone user, as 
Google’s Mail mobile Web sites and client apps for various smartphones are, 
at least at this writing, the best in the business.
However, Gmail’s contact management capability is still not as strong as 
Microsoft Outlook (known as Entourage on the Mac), which is still used by 
most people in a way that works on one machine at a time. It’s even common 
for people to have distinct Outlook setups on their home and work computers, 
with very different but overlapping data, and to have to spend time managing 
them separately and reconciling contacts that are shared between them.
People spend time wondering how to get separate clients like a cell phone or 
Google Voice updated with both their work and personal electronic contact 
information files. This hassle is part of the reason it’s popular for people to 
have separate cell phones for personal and work purposes. (Which kind of 
misses the whole point of going digital and even of having what are intended 
to be “all in one,” not “all in two,” mobile devices, but is still the best 
approach for a lot of people.)
This argues for making Gmail your main online e-mail program, importing as 
much information as you can into Google, then using Gmail for all your data 
or at least all your personal data. You may need to maintain your work infor­
mation separately, though of course you’ll have overlap between the two.
In this section, we describe how to get contact information into Google from 
three of the main sources: online e-mail programs; Outlook on Windows or 
its counterparts, Entourage and Address Book on the Mac; and paper-based 
records, such as a diary or business cards.

95
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
If you have a Gmail account, Google Voice will be pre-populated with those 
contacts. However, you may still want to use the steps in this chapter to get 
additional information into Google Voice, from where it will be available in 
Gmail and other Google services.
	
Avoid having Google Voice become an isolated piece added to a welter of per­
sonal information across various digital and paper-based forms. Use Google to 
centralize as much of your personal information as possible.
	
If you use GrandCentral, see Chapter 5 for information on how to move your 
GrandCentral contacts into Google. It’s not automatic, but it’s not difficult. Do 
it before you start entering information into Google Voice, though, to avoid 
duplicating effort.
	
Gmail has a major problem, said to be due to errors in its trademark registra­
tion in the U.K. While Google calls the service “Gmail” and allows people to 
use e-mail addresses ending in “gmail.com,” the legally correct name of the 
service in the UK is “Google Mail,” and the proper ending for Google’s e-mail 
addresses in the UK is the off-putting “@googlemail.com.” U.K. users some­
times have trouble verifying their identity on services where they’ve regis­
tered with a “gmail” account and the service has recorded them as having a 
“googlemail” account; let’s hope this problem doesn’t become global.
Export and importing Webmail 
contacts and e-mail
Google has introduced a new tool to help import contact information and 
even e-mails from other Webmail services into Gmail. It combines exporting 
information from the source and importing it into Google Voice.
Some other programs have had such tools in the past with good results. For 
example, Microsoft has had a tool based on TrueSwitch, which also underlies 
the Google offering, since mid-2007.
The intent is to get users like you to switch from your old e-mail provider to 
Gmail. For Google Voice users, this is generally a good idea. And the timing 
is good, too, because you’re going to be contacting people to get them to use 
Google Voice, so you might as well take the opportunity to give them a new 
e-mail address for you as well.
Google’s tool supports most major online e-mail providers, including AOL, 
EarthLink, Hotmail, and Yahoo! All you need is access to the account — the 
user name and password — and a bit of time to go through the steps, plus up 
to a day or two for e-mails to transfer over if you’ve so requested.

96
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
For a complete list of supported Webmail providers, check the list at this URL:
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=117173
For unsupported providers, and e-mail readers such as Outlook, Entourage, 
and Apple’s Address Book, use a CSV file for interchange, as described in the 
next section.
But Google’s import tool for contact information and e-mail messages is the 
best way to do this, if it’s available for your account. Follow these steps to 
use the tool:
	
1.	If you don’t already have a Gmail account, create one. Go to gmail.
com and follow the steps shown to create your account.
	
	 The import tool was initially available only for new Gmail accounts, but is, 
at this writing, steadily being rolled out to existing Gmail accounts as well.
	
2.	Open your Gmail inbox.
	
3.	Click the Settings link in the upper-right corner.
	
4.	Click the Accounts and Import link.
	
	 The Accounts and Import options appear.
	
5.	Click the Import mail and contacts button.
	
	 A dialog box requesting the e-mail address appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
	
Figure 5-1: 
Enter the 
e-mail 
address to 
import from.
	

97
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
	
6.	Type the e-mail address of the account you want to import from.
	
	 A dialog box requesting the relevant password appears.
	
7.	Type the password of the account you want to import from.
	
	 A dialog box requesting you to set the import options appears, as shown 
in Figure 5-2.
	
8.	Select import options; check or clear checkboxes to import contacts; 
import mail; continue importing mail for 30 days; and to add a label to 
all imported mail.
	
	 For our purposes here, you definitely want to import contacts. Only 
import mail if it has things you want to keep and if you intend to shut 
down, or at least mostly stop using, the account; otherwise you can just 
leave the existing e-mail in the other account.
	
	 If you do import the other account’s mail, we suggest that you create a 
label shorter than your full e-mail address, such as just the name of the 
provider: “Hotmail” or some such.
	
	 E-mail importing may take several hours or even a few days to complete.
	
9.	Click Start import.
	
	 Although timing might vary depending on a number of factors, the 
contacts information should be imported in a matter of minutes. E-mail 
importing may take many hours or even a few days. If you’ve chosen to 
import newly arriving e-mail messages over the next 30 days, these may 
take a day or two to show up as well.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
	 The Accounts and Import tab displays a message showing that import­
ing is in progress. It will also give you the option of whether to send 
out all messages using the Gmail account as the reply-to address, or 
whether to use the account the e-mail message was sent to — whether 
that’s the Gmail account or the account(s) being imported — as the 
reply-to address.
	
	 You can change the From address on specific e-mail messages by clicking 
the Change link in the From address area of the e-mail message.
	
	 You can use Gmail as a kind of control panel for several e-mail accounts, 
either on a transitional basis as a step toward getting rid of some of 
them or as an easier way to manage accounts you intend to maintain.
	
10.	Return to the Accounts and Import tab of your Gmail account to check 
on progress, as shown in Figure 5-3.
	
	 Keep checking this page to follow the progress of the importing process. 
When the process is complete, you’ll receive a notification via e-mail.
Exporting a CSV file from your mail reader
Most programs that store address book information, such as Microsoft 
Outlook, Microsoft Entourage for Mac, and Lotus Notes, can export address 
data in a standard file type called a CSV file. The CSV, or comma-separated 
values, format is a text file with commas, as the name suggests, separating 
the values.
	
Figure 5-3: 
Change 
the From 
address or 
check in on 
progress.
	

99
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
	
The great thing about CSV files is that you can easily create, read, and modify 
them yourself. You can edit the file most easily in a spreadsheet program — 
Google has a free one — being sure to export it again as a CSV file.
Apple’s Address Book exports contacts in vCard format, which Google can 
also import.
To get address book information from such programs, you export it as a CSV 
file (or in vCard format), then import the file into Google. (Thus the “free 
trade” pun in the title of this section.)
Follow these steps to export address book information from Outlook 2003; 
the process is similar for other programs:
	
1.	Open Outlook or the other program or online service.
	
2.	Choose File➪Import and Export.
	
	 The Import and Export Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 5-4.
	
3.	Choose Export to a file from the scrolling list and click Next.
	
	 The Wizard prompts you for the file type.
	
4.	Choose Comma Separated Values (Windows) and click Next.
	
	 The Wizard prompts you for the folder to export from.
	
Figure 5-4: 
Outlook’s 
Wizard 
helps you

100
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
5.	Choose Contacts and click Next.
	
	 The Wizard prompts you for the file name.
	
	 Windows attaches the extension .csv to the filename, and uses it to 
identify the file type, but does not show the extension in most displays 
of the filename.
	
6.	Type a name for the file and click Browse to choose a location for the file 
to be stored in. When you’ve entered the name and location, click Next.
	
	 The Wizard displays a confirmation message, just to be sure. It also 
Displays the Map Custom Fields button, you the opportunity to edit the 
fields that will be exported, to remove fields from what gets exported 
and to reorder the fields in the exported file.
	
7.	If you want to edit the list and order of fields to be exported, click the 
Map Custom Fields button. If not, skip to Step 10.
	
	 The Map Custom Fields dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-5.
	
8.	Edit the list of exported fields and drag and drop fields to reorder them.
	
	 Use the Previous and Next buttons to view specific entries. To start 
from an empty list, click Clear Map. To return to the original map, click 
Default Map.

9.	When you’re finished, click OK.
	
	 You return to the Export to a File dialog box.
	
10.	To export the file, click Finish.
	
	 The export proceeds.
	
11.	Open the exported file in a spreadsheet program, inspect it, and re-
export if needed.
	
12.	Edit the file in a spreadsheet program if you wish. You can delete 
rows and columns you don’t need and/or edit the field names to more 
closely match Google’s. Use the fields listed in the “Fields of dreams” 
sidebar, as a guide. When you’re done, save the file as a CSV file.
Entering data into a CSV file
You can edit a CSV file or create one from scratch, using it to hold informa­
tion you type in, for example, from an address book or business cards.
The easiest way to edit or create a CSV file is in a spreadsheet program, such 
as Microsoft Excel. You work with the file as usual, then save it as a CSV file. 
You can then import it into Google.
Follow these steps to create and enter data into a CSV file:
	
1.	Open your spreadsheet program and open a new file.
	
2.	Enter the field names across the top, in row 1.
	
	 Use field names similar or identical to the Google field names shown 
in the sidebar, “Fields of dreams.” Leave out less-used fields such as 
Phone-Pager.
Fields of dreams
Here are the fields in the Google address book: 
Name; Title; Company; Email-Home; Email-
Work; Email-Other; Phone-Home; Phone-Work; 
Phone-Mobile; Phone-Home Fax; Phone-Work 
Fax; Phone-Pager; Phone-Other; Address-
Home; Address-Work; Address-Other; plus 
several entries for Website, Birthday, additional 
fields that can be added, and Notes.
In a CSV export process, or when editing a 
CSV file, you can simplify what’s exported to 
make it as close as possible to the fields and 
field names that Google’s address book stores. 
This makes it more likely that Google will import 
the file correctly, with fewer problems and with 
less need for editing the resulting individual 
contacts.

102
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
	 If you need a model, export contacts from Outlook or Google and use the 
field names as a starting point. Google can recognize these formats and 
some others.
	
3.	Type the data for a few contacts in the rows below.
	
	 You can copy and paste the data from sources on your PC or type it in 
from paper sources such as an address book or business cards.
	
4.	Save the file as a CSV file.
	
	To start, choose File➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box, use the pull-
down menu to choose CSV (comma delimited) as the file type. Navigate 
to the destination you want to save the file to and click Save.
	
5.	Test the importing capability for the CSV file.
	
	  Follow the steps in the “Importing data from a CSV file” section.
	
	 Make sure that your new contacts come in the way you expect them to. 
Adjust the field names in the first row if needed and retry.
	
6.	Continue importing and entering data.
	
	 Your spreadsheet fills in and looks something like the spreadsheet in 
Figure 5-6.
	
7.	Save the file, as described in Step 4 above, and import it into Google, 
as described in the next section.
Importing data from a CSV file
You can use CSV files from various sources to update Gmail.

 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
	
Gmail can import a maximum of 3000 contacts at a time. If your CSV file has 
more than 3,000 contacts, you need to split it into parts. You can import a CSV 
file into a word processing or spreadsheet program, edit it, and then save one 
or more CSV files to get under the 3000-contact limit.
After you have the CSV file the way you want it, import it into Google:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site and click Contacts in the 
left-hand menu.
	
	 The Contacts page appears.
	
2.	Click the Import link in the upper-right corner of the page.
	
	 The Import page appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
	
3.	Click the Browse button to find the CSV file to import.
	
	 The Choose File to Import dialog appears.
	
4.	Find the file and click Open.
	
	 The file path appears in before the Browse button.
	
5.	To also add the contacts to a specific group, click the checkbox, and 
chose the group name from the pull-down menu, or specify that 
contacts will be placed in a new group.
	
	 The contacts are placed in the All Contacts list in any event, from which 
you can place them into specific groups relevant to Google Voice. They are 
only placed directly into a specific group if you click the checkbox here.
	
	 You may want to create a new Group for the contacts you are importing 
to go into. See the section on Groups below for information about how to 
create a new Group.
	
6.	Click Import to import the contacts.
	
	 The contacts will be brought into Google. Some contacts may not 
be brought in; if so, one or more error messages will describe the 
problem(s).
Combining contacts in Google Voice
There’s a potential challenge in using Google Voice: most computer-based 
contacts lists are e-mail centric, because that used to be the only way you 
could use a computer to communicate with other people.
But with Google offering Gmail, Google Talk, and Google Voice — as well as 
an online calendar for which address information is most useful — there’s a 
need for more complete contact information. In Google Voice, you’re likely to 
combine phone-oriented contacts (potentially imported from GrandCentral, if 
you were a GrandCentral user) with contacts that are e-mail centric.

104
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
Figure 5-7: 
Time to 
bring in your 
not-so-long-
lost data.
	
After you get your contacts right in Google Voice, they automatically become 
available in all Google applications. You can also export them for use in other 
tools such as Microsoft Outlook and Apple’s Address Book.
Follow these steps to combine contacts in Google Voice:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site and click Contacts in the 
left-hand menu.
	
	 The Contacts page appears.
	
2.	Click All Contacts.
	
	 You can combine two or more contacts from any of your groups of 
contacts but to make sure you don’t miss any, choose All Contacts.
	
3.	Click the first contact you want to merge.
	
	 The checkbox next to the contact name is selected. Review the contact 
details.
	
4.	Click the second contact you want to merge.
	
	 This removes the selection highlight and the check from the first contact, 
but displays the second contact’s details. Review the contact details. 
Ensure that you really do want to merge these two specific contacts.
	
	 You can merge more than two contacts at once, but it’s a bit of a stupid 
pet trick because the chance that you’ll lose information in the merge 
increases. If you have more than two contacts to merge, do it in several 
merge operations, checking at each step of the way.

105
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
	
5.	Hold down the Ctrl key and click on the first contact again.
	
	 The two contacts will be highlighted and the Merge these two 
contacts link appears, as shown in Figure 5-8.
	
	 Hold down Ctrl to maintain the existing selection and add the new 
contact you click to it. Hold down Shift to maintain the existing selec­
tion and add the new contact and any contacts in between. For adjacent 
contacts, either way will work, but using Ctrl is more flexible. We recom­
mend using Ctrl at all times to maintain, well, control. 
	
6.	Click the Merge these two contacts link.
	
	 Google Voice displays a proposed merge of the two contacts, as shown 
in Figure 5-9.
	
7.	Edit the information carefully.
	
	 Note that most fields are preserved. However, for the contact name, the 
name of the first contact in alphabetical order is used; the second name 
is discarded.
	
8.	Click Save to save the contact.
	
	 The revised contact is saved and the two contacts you merged to create 
it are deleted.
	
9.	Click the new contact and check to make sure the information is cor­
rect. Click the Edit button if you need to change anything.

Working with Groups
Groups in Google Voice are collections of one or more contacts that can take 
on the same settings for call handling. Groups created in Google Voice can 
also be used in other Google products.
You find several default groups — four that you manage yourself, and two 
that Google maintains for you:
	
✓	The groups you manage yourself are My Contacts and Friends, Family, 
and Co-workers.
	
✓	The groups that Google maintains for you are All Contacts, which is 
an all-inclusive group, and Most Contacted, the 20 contacts you are in 
touch with most frequently.
A contact can be assigned to one of the default groups from among the four 
you manage yourself or to a new, custom group you can create.
A contact can be assigned to more than one group; for example, someone can 
be in both the Friends and Family groups. Also, you can have My Contacts, 
Friends, Family, Co-workers and/or members of custom groups in a special-
purpose custom group, such as a group that you name “Poker Night.” 
However, managing overlapping groups can be confusing, and it can be dif­
ficult to be sure which group settings are in effect for contacts that belong to 
multiple groups.

107
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
Like individual contacts, a group can have:
	
✓	Specific settings for which of your phones ring when a member of the 
group calls.
	
✓	A specific greeting played when a member of the group leaves a voicemail.
	
✓	Call presentation — the potential for call screening and the ability to 
listen in when a caller is leaving a voicemail — turned on or off for 
members of the group.
When you change the settings for an individual contact, it overrides the set­
tings for the group(s) that the contact belongs to.
The following sections share instructions for adding an individual contact to 
a group and for creating a new group.
Creating and deleting groups
A new, custom group that you create can contain contacts that are separate 
from the other groups you manage directly — My Contacts, Friends, Family 
and Coworkers — or intermixed among them.
Follow these steps to create a new group:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site and click Contacts in the left-hand 
menu.
	
	 The Contacts page appears.
	
2.	Click the New Group button (marked with a + symbol and two heads).
	
	 A dialog box appears, asking what you want to name this group.
Contact management for centurions
Google Voice offers as useful a way to hand-
edit contacts as we’ve seen. However, if you’re 
a centurion — if you have 100 contacts or 
more — it may take too long to do everything 
in Google Voice.
Instead, you may want to export contacts to one 
or more CSV files and then combine them in a 
program that can handle CSV files, such as a 
spreadsheet or word processor. Then reimport 
the new file(s) into Google Voice. Where you 
can go through them, check that everything’s 
OK, and hand-edit anything that’s a problem!
If you’re a Centaurian, though, rather than a 
centurion, your address fields are going to be 
a bit complex, and we don’t know your phone 
numbering system — so you’re on your own.

108

3.	Enter a name for the group and click OK.
	
	 The new group name appears in the list of groups you manage directly, 
as shown in Figure 5-10.
	
4.	To remove a custom group, highlight a group name in the list of 
groups.
	
	 If the selected name represents a custom group, the Delete Group 
button will be highlighted for selection.
	
5.	Click the Delete group button to delete the highlighted group.
	
	 You are asked to confirm whether you want to delete the group.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 The group is deleted. The group’s contacts are still available through 
the All Contacts group and whatever other groups each contact may 
belong to.

Adding and removing contacts from groups
Follow these steps to add or remove contacts from a group:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site and click Contacts in the left-hand 
menu.
	
	 The Contacts page appears.

109
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
	
2.	Click the group, such as All Contacts, that has contacts in it that you 
want to assign to another group.
	
	 The group name is highlighted and the contacts in the group are listed 
with empty checkboxes next to their names for selection, as shown in 
Figure 5-11.
	
3.	Click the All link to select all the contacts in the displayed group; click 
the None link to deselect all of them; and click individual checkboxes 
to select or deselect individual contacts.
	
4.	Click the Groups button to display options for managing the Group 
memberships of the selected contacts.
	
	 The relevant options appear.
	
	 Not all of the choices shown in the Groups pull-down menu are neces­
sarily relevant to all the selected contacts, but each of the choices 
shown is relevant to at least one of the selected contacts. For instance, 
you are given the option to remove the selected contacts from the My 
Contacts group even if as few as one of them is actually a member of 
that group.

	 The action will be carried out.
Changing settings at the group level
Google Voice allows you to change settings at the group level, but only for 
three of the pre-defined groups: Friends, Family, and Coworkers or new 
groups that you create and populate yourself.
	
Google Voice does not allow you to change Google Voice settings at the Group 
level for the groups My Contacts, All Contacts, or Most Contacted.
When you specify settings at the group level, one option you have is to pick 
up the settings used at the overall level, as set in the General and Phones tabs, 
as described in the previous chapter. Doing it this way gives you a lot of power 
at the overall level to change settings for not only your non-contacts — calls 
from numbers not listed as belonging to one of your contacts — but for those 
contacts in your Friends, Family, Coworkers or custom groups as well.
So review those settings, if you need to, before or as you change the settings 
at the group level.
Follow these steps to change settings for a group:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site and click Settings in the left-hand 
menu.
	
	 The Settings page appears.
	
2.	Click the Groups tab.
	
	 A list of the groups for which you can change settings — Friends, Family, 
Coworkers and any custom groups you’ve created — appears, as shown 
in Figure 5-12. The list displays phone forwarding, greeting, and call pre­
sentation settings for each group.
	
	 You can also get to this screen by choosing Contacts and then highlight­
ing the name of a relevant group by clicking it in the list of groups that 
appears. Then click the link, Edit Google Voice Settings. The screen 
shown in Figure 5-12 appears.
	
	 The settings displayed here do apply at the group level, but may have 
been overridden for specific contacts within the group.
	
3.	Click the Edit button under the name of the group whose settings you 
with to edit.
	
	 The settings for the group appear, as shown in Figure 5-13.

Managing Settings at the Group Level
Managing your settings for Google Voice is where its power comes from, but 
also where there’s the most potential for confusion.
You can easily have hundreds of contacts in Google, growing to include all 
the people you exchange e-mail with. Only some of these people are likely 
to call you, and many of those will call only occasionally. Yet conveniently 
managing this “long tail” of occasional callers is one of the main benefits of 
Google Voice.
Harvesting phone numbers
One of the key advantages of Google Voice is 
the way it lets you move seamlessly between 
“live” phone calls, voicemail messages, text 
(SMS) messages, and e-mail. But this only 
works if you have people’s phone numbers.
Google Voice encourages a move from phone 
calls to e-mail. For example, Google Voice’s 
transcription feature, in which voicemail mes­
sages are transcribed and sent to you as e-mail, 
is an outright invitation to send an e-mail in 
some instances where you would have made a 
return phone call in the past.
But it works the other way, too. As more people 
use Google Voice, you may get phone calls 
and text messages where people would have 
e-mailed you in the past. As e-mail In boxes 
pile ever higher, a phone call can be a good 
way to cut through the noise. Google Voice 
encourages this.
Having people’s phone numbers — both so you 
can call them, and so you (and Google Voice) 
can recognize who’s on the other end when 
they call you — becomes ever more important. 
Moving to Google Voice is a good opportunity 
to get your contacts’ complete and up-to-date 
information. If you are getting a new Google 
Voice number, when you contact people to 
let them know your new number, ask for their 
numbers as well. If you move your cell phone 
to Google Voice, send an e-mail to your e-mail 
contacts who you might also wish to call, 
or who might call you, asking for their phone 
number.

113
 Chapter 5: Managing People in Google Voice
Google Voice has a nice summary presentation of settings for all groups from 
the Groups tab but nothing similar for individuals. So consider getting your 
groups set up correctly and changing Google Voice settings by group as 
much as possible. Then you can manage your high value such as close family 
members, close friends, and key co-workers individually when needed.
Gaining control of your phones is great. But losing track of settings such that 
you’re not getting calls you should be getting can be extremely frustrating. So 
give some thought to how you set things up.
	
It may seem extreme, but consider creating medium-sized groups, and even a 
couple of very small groups. You may even want to have one or a few groups 
with only one contact. The idea is to make the groups small enough that you 
manage all your settings at the group level. Then you can use the Groups 
summary presentation to quickly review all your important settings and make 
changes at the group level where needed. Doing this prevents you from having 
to go through potentially dozens of individual contacts one after another just 
to confirm what their settings are.

O
ne of the great advantages of the telephone is its simplicity. But people 
also want power. Google Voice is the best power tool so far for phones. 
It puts you above the action, managing your phones like players on your own 
personal team of devices. You can even add a ringer — a nearby phone that 
you want to use for just a little while — to help you win!
This chapter focuses on services available while using Google Voice on any 
phone and what you can do with the Google Voice Web site, whether you’re 
using it on a PC or using the mobile version on a smartphone. However, you 
won’t find any information on what you can do from your smartphone with 
various Google Voice dialer programs; you can find information on dialers in 
the chapters in Part III.
Adjusting Settings and Strategies
Basic telephone service: dialing, ringing, talking; is called POTS, for “plain old 
telephone service.” The great advantage of POTS phones is that they “just 
work.” And an advantage of a mobile phone is that you can turn it off — but 
one of the worse things is that you can forget you turned it off.
Google Voice gives you a whole new set of ways to break each of your 
phones — that is, to block calls from getting through. One of the benefits of 
being geared up with a home phone, an office phone, and one or more cell 
phones is that people have many ways to reach you. With Google Voice, you 
can control all of them centrally.

116
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
But there’s a basic tension here: The best way to avoid problems with 
Google Voice is to set and forget, to come up with a group of settings and to 
stick with it. On the other hand, much of the benefit from Google Voice is to 
change the settings frequently (for example, changing settings and messages 
when you travel).
You can get the best of both worlds by learning how to control the settings 
for Google Voice — and by having ready access to the settings you might not 
have memorized yet.
Don’t be afraid to limit how much twiddling you do, to set simple and clear 
rules even if your phone does ring occasionally when you didn’t necessar­
ily want it to. Even then, with Google Voice you have more options than you 
would without it.
	
The settings for Google Voice contacts and phones are explained in detail in 
Chapter 3. In this chapter, we just briefly mention what a function does; the 
focus is on changing settings.
Google Voice has several levels of settings: a top level, in either the General 
tab of settings or the Phones tab; a middle level, where you manage Groups; 
and a lower level, individual Contacts. Keeping on top of what your settings 
are can get confusing. There are three settings that can be managed at all 
three levels:
	
✓	Phone forwarding: This setting is the most basic element of Google 
Voice: which phones ring when different people call you. You set a 
default for which phones ring at the top level, in the Phones tab. At the 
Group level, you can create different settings, or use the settings in 
Phones as a default. At the Contact level, you can create different set­
tings again, or use the Group setting — which might refer back to the 
top-level, Phones setting.
	
✓	ListenIn settings: ListenIn, referred to as Call Presentations in the Settings 
area, is a very powerful feature of Google Voice, but it puts your callers 
through extra steps to call you. Controlling ListenIn settings is just like 
controlling phone forwarding: You set a default for ListenIn at the top 
level; you can then use that default or specific settings at the Group level, 
and use Group settings or Contact-specific settings at the Contact level.
	
✓	Voicemail message settings: Your voicemail messages that can be used 
in any part of Google Voice can be managed — added to, renamed, 
and deleted — from the General tab, within a Group setting or at the 
Contacts level. After you have your messages list right, you can choose 
a message in the General tab as a default; use or override it at the Group 
level; and use the Group setting (which may be the overall default) or a 
new, specific setting for a given contact.

117
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
These three types of settings are covered in their own sections below, but 
thinking about them holistically is also important, so that you can make your set­
tings as complex as you need — but not so complex as to cause you confusion.
Changing Which Phones Ring
Having the ability to decide which phones ring when someone calls your 
Google Voice number is the most important function in Google Voice. Google 
Voice honcho Craig Walker described it as allowing you to “never miss a 
call you do want, and never take a call you don’t want.” This vision creates a 
power struggle: people want to be able to call and, potentially, interrupt you; 
you want to control when and how that happens.
Google Voice gives you a lot of power in managing this crucial capability. And 
after you get this right, it’s like a dream; your phones are finally tamed. The 
second is, with voicemail notifications via e-mail — and, if you so choose, 
via text — the penalty for missing a call is lower, as you get notification and 
a transcription shortly after. You can revert to the caller quickly and accu­
rately, completing the communication.
We recommend that you be generous in allowing calls through initially. You 
are, in essence, trying to train your contacts to call you at a number that’s 
based in “the cloud” — on the Internet — rather than tied to a particular 
phone. If you’re usually available, they (and you) learn to trust this approach. If 
not, people either get frustrated, or just keep calling you on your direct phone 
numbers — in which case Google Voice just becomes another phone number 
and voice message mailbox that you have to manage along with the others.
Quickly changing a pair of Generals
At the General level, two settings don’t inter­
act directly with other settings at the Group 
or Contact level, and you may want to change 
these settings frequently, and in concert with 
one another. These are
	✓	How you’re alerted to new voicemails. 
Your choices are by email and/or by SMS 
text message to a cell phone.
	✓	Do Not Disturb. This setting sends all calls 
to voicemail. Unfortunately, you can’t set 
up Do Not Disturb to have exceptions for 
emergency calls.
Most of the time, you probably won’t want SMS 
text message alerts for voicemails to be turned 
on; if you’re billed for text messages by your 
wireless carrier, the charges add up. But you 
may want to turn on SMS text message alerts 
for voicemail when Do Not Disturb is on — that 
way you can quickly respond to any calls that 
seem urgent, without allowing them to actually 
ring your phone.

118
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
We also recommend that you manage phones at the overall level as set in 
the Phones tab of the Settings area wherever possible; and that, when that’s 
not enough, you use Groups rather than individual Contacts. (See the “Group 
strategy” sidebar for an interesting twist on this approach.) Otherwise, you 
may have to review each and every one of your Contacts on a regular basis 
just to remind yourself how phone forwarding is set up for each of them!
Finding out about phone forwarding
The phone forwarding settings for a Contact can be set at three levels, with 
more capabilities at the lowest level, specific Contacts:
	
✓	At the Contact level, you can set each of your phones to ring or not 
ring; send that Contact to Voicemail, treat as Spam or block the caller 
entirely; or default to the setting for that user’s Group.
	
✓	At the Group level, you can only set phones to ring or not ring, or default 
to the top-level setting in the Phones tab of the Settings area. You can’t 
send all the Contacts in a Group to Voicemail, treat them as Spam or, 
block all the callers in the Group entirely.
	
✓	In the Phones tab of the Settings area, you can only control which 
phones your Google Voice number rings through to, assuming that the 
default setting is used at the Group level and the Group setting is used at 
the individual Contact level. You can’t send calls through to Voicemail, 
treat them as Spam, or block them entirely at this level.
	
However, in the General tab, you can turn on the Do Not Disturb option, which 
does have the effect of sending all calls to voicemail (overriding Group and 
Contact-level settings).
Group strategy
In Chapter 3, we recommended a strategy for 
managing which phones ring, and we’ll repeat 
it here. Google Voice makes it very easy to see, 
at the Group level, which phones are set to ring, 
which greeting is played, and whether call pre­
sentation (i.e. ListenIn) is on or off. 
We suggest that you control as much as pos­
sible at the Group level; and that you even go 
to extremes and create one-person Groups for 
the very few people who call you most. That 
way you rarely, if ever, need to override Group 
settings at the individual Contact level, because 
your key Contacts are Groups of their own. And 
you can always get a quick display of the cur­
rent settings in effect by looking at the Groups 
screen, because you know you rarely if ever 
override them at the individual level.

119
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
A phone can be set to On or Off at the Contact level. But if the phone is set to 
Ring <group> phones at the Contact level, the actual setting depends on the 
Group and/or General setting, as shown in Table 6-1.

Changing phone forwarding settings
The following sections explain how to use the Google Voice Web site 
or Google Voice mobile site to change phone forwarding settings for all of 
Google Voice, a group of callers or a single caller quickly and effectively.
Creating a “sin bin” or several
You can create one Group for users who are 
blackballed or even — if you have a lot of 
people you want to treat harshly — separate 
Groups for people who are always sent through 
to voicemail, always treated as spam, or always 
blocked.
If you use Groups in this way to control ringing 
phones, you can also use the same Groups to 
ease setting up your ListenIn settings and your 
voicemail messages, which again are likely to 
be more controlling for people you are making 
sure never reach you directly.
Using Groups for people who share certain 
Google Voice settings is a bit different than the 
original intent of Groups — “Friends” and so on. 
But people always find ways to make systems 
do what they want them to do. Google Voice is 
involved in a very important part of your life, and 
you should bend it to your will any way you can.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Setting the default forwarding setting for all Groups
	
The settings you assign in the Phones tab can be used by Groups or overrid­
den by Groups. Settings at the Group level can be used by individual Contacts 
or overridden by settings at the Contact level. So the settings in the Phones 
tab only take effect if they’re not overridden by Group or Contact settings. 
Follow these steps to set the default forwarding setting for all Groups:
	
1.	Click the Settings link in the upper part of your screen.
	
2.	Click the Phones tab.
	
	 You see a list of your phones, as shown in Figure 6-1.
	
3.	Click in each checkbox to set the phone as On for forwarding or Off as 
a default setting.
	
Turning forwarding for each phone On or Off here only affects the phone if its 
Group setting is Ring Default phones and the individual Contact is set to Ring 
<group> phones. It doesn’t function as a control panel from which you can 
turn phones on or off regardless of other settings. 
Changing the settings for a Group:
Settings at the Group level can override settings at the top level, under Phones. 
If you use the default setting, Ring Default phones for most or all Groups, then 
the top-level setting has more effect. That also means you have less to remember 
about which Groups are set to do what when you want to change settings, for 
instance before a vacation or business trip. Follow these steps:
	
1.	In the Settings area, click the Groups tab.
	
2.	Under the name of the Group you want to change settings for, click Edit.
	
3.	Then turn forwarding for each phone On or Off; or click the Ring 
Default phones link to adopt the setting in the Phones tab.
Turning the phone ringing on or off for a Contact
Settings at the Contacts level can override settings at the top level, under 
Phones or at the Group level. If you use the default setting, Ring <group> 
phones, for most or all Contacts, then the Group settings have more effect. 
This prevents you from having to inspect, and potentially change, the set­
tings for many contacts when you make a change in your routine, such as 
taking a day off.
	
1.	Click Contacts in the left-hand menu.
	
2.	To reach any Contact directly, choose All Contacts in the middle pane 
and then click an individual Contact.
	
3.	Click the Edit Google Voice Settings link.

cable Group’s settings; it controls where Google Voice looks for the Contact’s 
settings if you choose to default to the Group’s phone forwarding, voicemail 
message or ListenIn (“Call Presentation”) options.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
You can turn forwarding On or Off for various phones or send that Contact 
straight to Voicemail, treat them as Spam, or block them entirely. The final 
option is to choose Ring <group> phones, in which case ringing uses the 
Group setting, as described earlier.
	
Turning forwarding for each phone On or Off here only affects the phone if its 
Group setting is Ring Default phones and the individual Contact is set to Ring 
<group> phones. It doesn’t function as a control panel from which you can 
turn phones on or off regardless of other settings.
To determine the phone ringing setting for an individual Contact:
	
✓	Look at that Contact first, as described earlier. If it’s set to On or Off, 
Send to Voicemail, Treat as Spam or, Block Caller, you have your 
answer.
	
✓	If the Contact is set to Use <group> settings, you have to look at the set­
ting for the chosen Group, as described earlier. If the Group is set to On 
or Off for each specific phone, you have your answer. If the Group is set 
to Ring Default phones, you have to look at the setting in the Phones tab, 
as described earlier.
Using ListenIn
Phones are social instruments, and ListenIn strategy is a tricky part of the 
social aspect of using Google Voice. It allows you to continue the old prac­
tice, from answering machine days, that allows people to screen calls before 
picking them up.
Think of it from the caller’s point of view. Instead of just calling you and 
having the phone ring, the caller might be asked to identify themselves. Then 
they might get sent to voicemail. Then you might or might not bother to pick 
up the call while they’re leaving a message. What a message that sends!
The wording is tricky, too. Google Voice promotes ListenIn as an important fea­
ture of Google Voice, but in the Settings area it refers to the same feature as Call 
Presentation, a soporific term that sounds like something entirely different.
So keep your callers’ needs in mind when setting up ListenIn (using the Call 
Presentation settings) and using it. Some Google Voice users even report 
abandoning ListenIn entirely out of concern for how their callers might feel 
about it. But most Google Voice users will use ListenIn at least some of the 
time, so it’s worth learning how to use the feature well.

123
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
Changing ListenIn settings
The ListenIn setting for a Contact can be set, using the options labeled Call 
Presentation, at three levels:
	
✓	At the Contact level, you can turn ListenIn On or Off, or default to the 
setting for the Group.
	
✓	At the Group level, you can turn ListenIn On or Off, or default to the 
General setting.
	
✓	At the General level, you can set the default that may or may not get 
used by various Groups and, via the Group setting, by various Contacts.
ListenIn can be set to On or Off at the Contact level. But if ListenIn is set to 
Default at the Contact level, the actual setting depends on the Group and/or 
General setting, as shown in Table 6-2.

Ring Friends’ phones?
The wording of some of the prompts and options 
of Google Voice is potentially confusing. The 
option to Ring <group> phones — for instance, 
to Ring Friends’ phones — is one such example.
If you choose Ring Friends’ phones, Google 
Voice does not, in fact, ring the phones of your 
friends when that Contact calls you. It uses 
the settings in the Friends Group to determine 
which of your phones ring.
When you think about it, this is easy enough to 
remember when you’re fully paying attention. 
But perhaps some of the medicines that can 
make you drowsy, and that say “do not drive or 
operate heavy machinery while using this medi­
cine” on the packaging, should add: “or change 
your Google Voice settings.”

125
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
	
For the specific Contact, begin by checking the pull-down menu at the top, Use 
settings from: <group>. For Contacts that are in multiple Groups, this allows 
you to choose the “allegiance” of the various kinds of settings. It does not 
automatically change that Contact’s settings to the applicable Group’s set­
tings; it controls where Google Voice “looks” for the Contact’s settings if you 
choose to default to the Group’s phone forwarding, voicemail message or 
ListenIn (“Call Presentation”) options.
	
Figure 6-3: 
The Group 
level is

One screen to ring them all?
Because you can send calls to voicemail, treat 
them as spam, or block them entirely at the 
Contact level — not at the Group nor at the top, 
Phones level — you have to look at individual 
Contacts before you can be sure what the set­
tings are. There are only two ways to avoid this.
One is to put everyone who’s sent to voicemail, 
treated as spam, or blocked entirely in one 
overarching “bad” Group, or three separate 
Groups, as described earlier in the sidebar, 
Creating a “sin bin.”
The other is to never use these options at the 
Contact level and use the Do Not Disturb setting 
in the General tab of the Settings area to send 
everyone to voicemail when you don’t want to 
be disturbed. Because you can get e-mail alerts 
and, if you choose, text message alerts, this is a 
practical option you may want to consider.

126
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Under the heading, Enable Call Presentation for this Contact?, select the set­
ting. Click the Edit link to change it to Default. To determine the ListenIn 
setting for an individual Contact:
	
✓	Look at that Contact first, as described earlier. If it’s set to On or Off, you 
have your answer.
	
✓	If the Contact is set to Use <group> settings, you have to look at the 
Group setting, as described in Step 2. If the Group is set to On or Off, you 
have your answer. If the Group is set to Default, you have to look at the 
General setting, as described in Step 1 earlier.
Pushing buttons for ListenIn
You’re quite likely to use ListenIn at least some of the time. Here’s how to 
push buttons when ListenIn kicks in.
Your phone rings, and Google Voice announces that you have a call. It also 
announces the name of your caller — either reading it out of your Contacts, 
or playing back a name it recorded from the caller. It then starts reading out 
the options you have for handling the call.
Now you may be in a stressful situation — driving, or in a meeting (but using 
Google Voice to allow at least some potentially important calls to come through). 
So you want to decide whether to take the call as quickly as possible. Here are 
the options that you want to memorize:
Option 1: Accept the call. You can press 4 during the call to start 
recording it.
Option 2: Let the call roll into voicemail.
Option 3: Let the call roll into voicemail and ListenIn on the voicemail; 
press * to pick up the call after ListenIn has begun.
Option 4: Accept the call and start recording it from the beginning. (The 
caller will hear a message to alert them.)
To sum up, Options 1 and 4 both accept the call, with 4 also turning record­
ing on. Options 2 and 3 both send the call to voicemail, with 3 also turning on 
ListenIn.
	
The easiest way to use ListenIn is to set all your Contacts to Use <group> 
setting, and all your Groups to Default. Then you can turn ListenIn on or off for 
all your callers at once by changing the On/Off setting at the General level.
If you do it any other way, you get more fine-tuning of control, but risk having 
to do a lot of looking around at settings to know what’s going on. This is an 

127
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
example of the convenience versus control balance you need to consider for 
many Google Voice settings.
Changing Voicemail Greetings
When phone answering machines first appeared a quarter-century ago, they 
were not only popular, but they became a cultural phenomenon. You may 
remember Friends episodes that turned on answering machine greetings and 
messages.
With people having to juggle multiple phones — a home phone, work, and cell 
phone, in many cases — just trying to retrieve and return messages from differ­
ent answering services became an exhausting task, and people tended to keep 
their outgoing messages simple. But as you get more and more of your voice­
mail messages through a single source (your Google Voice online mailbox) you 
may want to consider having some fun with voice messages again.
Google Voice is very clever this way. It lets you record a number of messages 
(as we describe in Chapter 3) and assign them by using the same three-level 
structure as ringing phones and ListenIn settings — an overall default setting, 
Group-level, and Contact-level control.
Voicemail greeting messages are inherently personal, and you may have a very 
good reason for not wanting your friends and family to hear the same message 
as your work colleagues. You may also want to give timely information about 
trips and so on in a different way to different people.
You can create a new voicemail message at any time, from any point in Google 
Voice where the list of voicemail messages is available — in the General tab of 
the Settings area, in a Group, or in a Contact. A voicemail message you create 
in any of these places can be used there, or in any of the others.
	
It’s possible to end up with fragments of Google Voice error recordings on the 
answering machines of any and all phones you don’t answer when a call rings 
them. To prevent this in at least some cases, make your voicemail greeting at 
least 15 seconds long.
You can also use voicemail greetings as a kind of message board: for your 
Friday night poker party, you can put the specific refreshments assignment in a 
voicemail greeting, and then have people leave a message to commit or bail.
So unlike the more serious settings described above, for which we advise 
caution, for voicemail messages we say: go flipping nuts. This kind of playing 

128
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
around helps you enjoy life and learn how to use Google Voice better. And 
having someone hear the wrong message is not likely to be a very big deal.
	
Some people have asked for control down to the level of having different set­
tings, not just for Groups or specific Contacts, but depending on which of the 
Contact’s phones the person calls you from. This isn’t promised, but luckily 
there’s a workaround: Just create several Contacts for the same person, with 
each one having a different phone number. Then you can really take Google 
Voice to the max.
Finding out what you can do 
with voicemail messages
First, remember that there are three ways people can get a voicemail 
message from you:
	
✓	You send them straight to voicemail by using your phone forwarding 
capabilities at the individual Contact level, or by setting Do Not Disturb 
in the General tab of the Settings area.
	
✓	You can see and/or hear that they’re calling, but let them go through to 
voicemail after several rings, with or without ListenIn on.
	
✓	You’re not paying attention to the relevant (phones) at the time, so the 
call goes through to voicemail after several rings.
You can control what greeting people get at three levels, similarly to the 
way you can control ringing your phones or ListenIn:
	
✓	At the Contact level, you can choose from any of your voicemail mes­
sages and assign it to that Contact. So you can have a specific message 
for your sweetie, but don’t use the same message for your boss! (“Hi 
darling” could put your job on the line, so be careful!) You can also 
choose to use the meeting for the Group that Contact is in; the; or the 
completely generic System Standard greeting.
	
✓	At the Group level, you can choose from any of your voicemail messages 
and assign it to that Group. This includes the Default Greeting, set at the 
top level, in the General tab of the Settings area. However, the Group-
level setting only affects the Contacts in that Group that are set to use 
the Group’s voicemail greeting.
	
✓	At the top level, in the General tab of the Settings area, you can choose 
from any of your voicemail messages. The settings you choose affect 
only Groups assigned to use Default Greeting. At the level of individual 
Contacts, it then affects Contacts set to use Default Greeting or the 
greeting of the Group the Contact is in.

129
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
	
Voicemail greetings work differently from how your phones ring and how you 
set ListenIn in one important way: Individual Contacts can be set to use the 
voicemail greeting set at the top level, in the General tab of the Systems area. 
So you can use the top-level setting as a control panel for the greeting that you 
want to use throughout the system.
Changing voicemail greeting settings
Here’s how to use the Google Voice Web site to change phone forwarding set­
tings for all of Google Voice, a Group of callers, or a single caller quickly and 
effectively:
	
1.	Click the Settings link in the upper part of your screen.
	
2.	Click the General tab, shown in Figure 6-4.
	
3.	Use the pull-down menu next to the prompt, Voicemail greeting, to 
choose a greeting as the system-wide default.
UI UI, oh no, sayin’ me gotta go
A very common mistake at parties is to play the 
song “Louie, Louie” over and over. And over. 
And over. . . .
A very common mistake in user interface design 
is to mix “set and forget” settings that you might 
only need to ever see once with settings that 
need to get accessed in a hurry. When you sit 
down in your car, you set the mirrors before you 
go, but you shift gears constantly, which is why 
the controls aren’t next to each other.
Unfortunately, Google Voice’s relatively clean, 
attractive, and easy-to-use interface makes all 
options seem as if they’re created equal. Let’s 
look at how often you’re likely to change various 
settings in the General tab of the Settings area:
	✓	Language: Set and forget.
	✓	Time zone: Only change when you travel — 
and maybe not only then, as it only controls 
time-of-day-specific Google Voice settings 
that many people won’t use.
	✓	Voicemail Greeting: Set and forget for some 
people, constantly changed (at several 
levels of control) for others.
	✓	Recorded Name: Set and forget.
	✓	Notifications (how voicemail alerts are han­
dled): Most people say yes to e-mail notifi­
cations once and change the target e-mail 
address very rarely, whereas the text mes­
sage notification setting may be changed 
fairly often.
	✓	Call Screening: Set and forget.
And so on. This mix of fast and slow functions 
can be really frustrating when you’re in a hurry 
and trying to make a quick change. In our 
humble opinion, Google Voice needs a control 
panel for settings that are likely to be changed 
frequently. You can sort of use the Groups tab 
for this if you use Group-level settings where 
possible, an option recommended throughout 
this chapter.

	 Note that this is the system-wide default, but that the choice you 
make here can be overridden, or used, by specific Groups and specific 
Contacts, separately or in conjunction.
	
4.	To change the settings for a Group: In the Settings area, click the 
Groups tab. Under the name of the Group you want to change settings 
for, click Edit. Then choose the greeting you want from the pull-down 
menu; choose Default Greeting to always use the greeting chosen by 
the process described in Step 1.
	
5.	To turn the settings for a Contact: Click Contacts in the left-hand 
menu. To reach any Contact directly, choose All Contacts in the 
middle pane, then click an individual Contact. Click the Edit Google 
Voice Settings link.
	
6.	Choose the greeting you want from the pull-down menu: Choose Default 
Greeting to always use the greeting chosen by the process described 
in Step 1. Choose <Group> Greeting to always use the greeting chosen 
by the process described in Step 2.
To determine the voicemail message setting for an individual Contact:
	
✓	Look at that Contact first, as described in Step 3 above. If it’s set to any­
thing except <Group> Greeting or Default Greeting, you now know the 
answer.
	
✓	If the Contact is set to <Group> Greeting, you have to look at the setting 
for the chosen Group, as described in Step 2 above. If the Contact is set to 
Default Greeting, or if the Contact is set to <Group> Greeting and the Group 
is set to Default Greeting, you have to look at the setting in the Phones 
tab, as described in Step 1 above, to find out which greeting is in use.

 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
Working with voicemail 
messages on the line
One of the great plusses of Google Voice is having all of your voice messages 
unified — once you’ve gotten everyone switched over to using your Google 
Voice number instead of your cell phone, home phone, work phone, and so 
on. So checking messages should be easy.
Unfortunately, although Google Voice only offers a few options, remembering 
them is not that easy. With a little practice, you can get it. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Call your Google Voice number. If necessary to access your account, 
press * and enter your PIN.
	
	 If you’re calling from one of your registered phones that connects directly 
to your Google Voice account — usually, this is your cell phone — Google 
Voice offers you options directly; if not, you need to press * and enter 
your PIN to access your account and hear options.
	
2.	Press 1 to access voicemail.
	
	 Google Voice tells you how many messages you have and then reads off 
the first one.
	
3.	Then press the following options:
 
• 2 to return the call.
 
• 7 to archive the message.
 
• 8 to mark it as “spam” (which marks the caller’s number as spam 
as well).
 
• 9 to keep the message as new.
	
	 You can archive any messages you don’t want to return from your voice­
mail list, because you will still have the message notification, link, and 
transcript. If you delete the message, you still have the message notifica­
tion and (possibly illegible) transcript, but the link to the message will 
no longer work.
	
4.	Repeat for each of your messages.
People like Google Voice because it gives them tools to handle voice mes­
sages in a variety of different ways. If this describes you, actually returning 
the call from your voicemail box might seem almost quaint. But it’s a great 
way to get things handled. If you’re not going to deal with the message from 
your voice mailbox, though, archive it rather than deleting it; you’ll still want 
the link to work from your e-mail notification.

132
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Changing Text Message Settings
One of the huge improvements in Google Voice over GrandCentral is support 
for text messaging. GrandCentral simply ignored text messages; who knows 
how many texts were sent to GrandCentral numbers and lost in the ether, never 
to be received? Google Voice, on the other hand, does a great job with texts.
At least one GrandCentral user has complained in online forums about their 
Inbox filling up with text messages now that she’s upgraded to Google Voice. 
She must have been happier just losing the messages before!
	
However, now there is an alternative to receiving texts on your cell phone. All 
texts sent to your Google Voice number show up in your Google Voice Inbox. 
If you don’t forward the text message to your cell phone(s), they don’t count 
against your text message allowance(s) or cause charge(s) on your cell phone 
bill(s).
There are several ways you can handle text messages without ever forwarding 
them to your cell phone:
	
✓	Handle them in Google Voice Inbox on a PC.
	
✓	Handle them in Google Voice Inbox on Google Voice Mobile on a 
smartphone.
	
✓	Reply to the e-mail notification you get for the text message by calling or 
e-mailing the person, not texting them at all.
Was GrandCentral better? Discuss!
Google Voice has a lot of capabilities that its 
predecessor, GrandCentral, lacked. One of 
the few things that didn’t make the leap from 
GrandCentral to Google Voice was RingShare.
RingShare allowed GrandCentral users to 
create custom greeting music for callers. 
Instead of a ring, callers would hear whatever 
MP3 file the GrandCentral user wanted them to 
hear.
Extra work for the GrandCentral user? For sure. 
Potentially confusing? Very much so. A lot of 
fun? Definitely.
GrandCentral sign-ups were always tightly 
restricted, first by typical start-up growing 
pains, then by a sensible Google-imposed 
cutoff after it acquired GrandCentral in 2007 
(and quietly started building Google Voice on 
the GrandCentral foundation). And, unlike other 
desired features, Google has not made any 
encouraging noises about reviving it.
Why? Speculation is rampant (among the few 
thousand of us who even care). There may 
be copyright problems with people grabbing 
random (and potentially copyrighted) MP3s 
and using them for RingShare. Such concerns 
have hardly stopped Google in other ventures. 
Perhaps the true answer will never be known.

133
 Chapter 6: Changing Settings in Google Voice
You can use all of these methods when they’re convenient for you.
	
Remember to keep a small allowance for text messages on each of your cell 
phones so you don’t pay an inordinate charge for the occasional text that 
does go straight to your cell phone.
With all this flexibility, you may find yourself wanting to change your cell 
phone settings frequently as your needs for receiving text messages directly 
on your cell phone change. Here’s how to do it:
	
1.	Click the Settings link in the upper part of your screen. Click the 
Phones tab.
	
	 A list of your phones appears.
	
2.	Click Edit under one of the phones listed (probably one designated
as Mobile).
	
	 The phone description appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
	
3.	Click in the checkbox labeled Receive SMS on this phone to turn SMS 
reception on or off.
	
4.	Click Save.
	
	 You return to the list of your phones.
	
5.	Repeat for all your cell phones.
One of the toughest issues for Google Voice and for you as a Google Voice 
user is to keep sending calls and texts through your Google Voice number, so 
people don’t see the phone numbers of your actual, physical phones.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Replying to a text is fine, as long as you do it the right way. As a Google Voice 
user, there are five ways you can send a text through Google Voice, and the 
only one you should avoid is the easiest and most familiar:
	
✓	Do: Reply to a text from your Google Voice Inbox.
	
✓	Do: Send a text from Google Voice on your PC.
	
✓	Do: Send a text from Google Voice Mobile on your smartphone.
	
✓	Do: Send a text from a dialer program running on your phone (see Part III).
	
✓	Don’t: Send a new text directly from your cell phone “the old-fashioned 
way.” This is the easiest and most familiar technique, but unfortunately 
it’s the only one in which the recipient will see your cell phone number 
and possibly start using that instead of your Google Voice number.
Not sending texts from your cell phone is going to be tough if the phone doesn’t 
run Google Voice Mobile and doesn’t have a dialer program available — but 
if you want to get the most out of Google Voice, you have to avoid doing this. 
Given how smartphone sales are rising, one way to avoid this is obvious . . . 
though hardly a way to save money.
	
When you reply to a text from a PC, with its nice, comfortable keyboard, it’s 
easy to go over the limit for text messages of 160 characters. Keep texts short, 
even if you’re sending them from a PC!
	
Some cell phone providers have refurbished phones available and provide 
warranties for them as well. Both of the authors make a point of buying refur­
bished equipment, including cell phones, whenever possible. It’s not only 
cheap; it’s green (better for the environment). Check that a dialer program 
is available for the phone you choose before committing, and that you have 
a window of time for making sure you’re satisfied, not least with using the 
phone with Google Voice, after you receive the phone.
	
You’re not frozen out from even the most talked about equipment with refur­
bished gear. Apple is one tech manufacturer that has long made a point of 
offering refurbished equipment, and the iPhone is no exception. Other provid­
ers also offer refurbished phones.
	
Consider a pay-as-you go plan with Google Voice, because many of your 
minutes and texts will be through Google Voice or shifted to landlines rather 
than through your cell phone. This option can work well with a new phone 
or a refurbished phone, from a carrier or on the open market and unlocked, 
though some smartphone providers won’t allow this.

especially if you keep your settings simple and know how to change 
them quickly, as we describe in the previous chapter.
Google Voice phone calls are different than most. Control of the call resides 
with the Internet and all the servers and other computers connected to it. 
But the actual call is handled over traditional phone networks. You gain 
better call quality and reliability, but you may get some usability hassles. The 
control layer can’t always make the traditional phone networks do what you 
might want them to do.
This is why Google Voice can’t, ironically, do as much with calls you make — 
which would seem to be more under the control of Google Voice — than with 
calls you receive. It’s easier to manipulate the incoming voice stream than 
the outgoing one.
This chapter tells you how to use Google Voice to save time and money. 
Everything involved is easy to do, but does requires changing some of your 
phone habits. The benefit is that you save ever more time and money as you 
get better at using Google Voice.
Saving Money with Phone Flexibility
In just the last 20 years, we’ve seen the maturing of one revolution in phone 
use and the beginning of another. The first revolution was the move from 
using landline phones to using mobile phones. Then came the burgeoning 
move from both types of phones to voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) calls, 

136
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
made over a computer through services, such as Skype. And now a service is 
available that combines traditional telephone lines and Internet-based control, 
Google Voice.
	
We aren’t sure how to help you avoid getting Google Voice and Google Talk 
confused because the difference still sometimes eludes us, too.
The control and convenience of the cell phone is trumping the advantages of 
old-fashioned POTS (plain old telephone service) phones, which remain better 
on call quality and reliability. And the cost savings of VOIP calls — along with 
convenience, for those of us who have come to like talking on the phone using 
full headphones — sometimes trump the advantages of cell phones, even with 
their convenience.
Table 7-1 summarizes the advantages of each type of phone, reminding you 
when best to use each.
In this chapter, we show you how to use Google Voice to get the mobility and 
control advantages of the cell phone, while taking advantage of the quality 
and low cost of a landline. You can even use Google Voice to move calls to 
and from your computer with Gizmo 5, which is described in Chapter 11.

Shifting a call to another phone
Shifting a call that you’ve received to another phone that’s registered with 
Google Voice is seemingly easy; just press * at any time during the call. Doing 
this makes all the phones registered to your Google Voice account ring at 
once, provided they’re selected to ring; just pick up the other phone you 
want to use with Google Voice and continue your call.
By using the * key, you can easily switch a cell phone call to your home land­
line, for example, when you’re sitting comfortably at home; you can switch it 

137
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
back if you need to free up your home phone or continue the call while you 
go on the move.
This technique also works for shifting a call to an assistant or colleague, if 
their phone is registered to your Google Voice account.
	
A phone can only be registered to one Google Voice account at a time, so having 
your assistant’s or friend’s phone registered to your Google Voice account may 
become impossible if they register for their own Google Voice account.
But this is where some bad news can bite: with the words, “rings all the 
phones attached to your Google Voice account at once.” You don’t necessar­
ily want your assistant’s and best friend’s phone to ring when you’re switch­
ing a call from your cell phone to your home phone. And you don’t want to 
bother the people at home with spurious rings of the landline while you’re 
switching calls at work.
Saving money live with Google Voice
Cell phones are great for flexibility, control, and convenience. But they cost 
you; recent analyses of the cost of a smartphone and service plan over a 
two-year period show the total adding up to thousands of dollars. And that’s 
without even counting the sticker shock on your bill when you make a few 
international calls without the benefit of a special rate or go over any limits 
your plan has on talk time, SMS text messages, or data transfer.
There’s another dirty little secret of cell phones: they aren’t as good at 
supporting conversations — the core purpose of a phone — as a landline phone. 
Signal quality varies; heavy compression of sound, inherent in the technology, 
can damage the quality of speech for you and the other caller.
Get the best possible results from cell phones and landlines by using Google 
Voice to save money when you’re getting phone calls. Follow these tips:
	
✓	When you get a call on Google Voice, your mobile and a landline may ring 
at the same time. By picking up the landline phone, you avoid using cell 
plan minutes, get better call quality, and use a more comfortable handset.
	
✓	Start a call on your cell phone if you want to take advantage of built-in 
contacts or to use a Google Voice dialer to make the call easier. When 
you use the dialer, you can assign your nearby landline phone to ring 
instead of your cell, so you can actually conduct the call on the landline.
	
✓	If you receive a call on your cell phone and find it’s going longer than you 
thought, press * during the call and pick up from a nearby landline phone.
	
✓	If your cell phone doesn’t work or has poor call quality, whether at 
home or at the office, Google Voice solves the problem; calls to your 
Google Voice number ring your cell phone and landlines as well.

138
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
As you may well know by now from experience, Google Voice doesn’t work 
with extension numbers in offices.
Dialing into Google Voice directly
The “hard way” to use Google Voice is to pick up a landline handset or a cell 
phone without a dialer, dial your Google Voice number, press 2 to make a 
call, and then dial the outgoing number.
The extra steps involved are considered to be so difficult that no one will 
ever do them, meaning that Google Voice calls will almost always be initiated 
from a computer or a Google Voice dialer program running on a cell phone.
However, in certain situations dialing into Google Voice to make a call is 
worthwhile:
	
✓	When you’re making a call to another country. You may want to make 
an appointment to make sure the other person will be there. Making an 
appointment first saves you the hassle of doing the two-step dialing pro­
cess too many times. It also avoids making the other person call you back, 
potentially at great expense to him, and helps you avoid time difference 
concerns that narrow the desirable calling window for each of you.
	
✓	When you’re using someone else’s phone. One of the great hassles in 
life is not having a phone number nearby from which you can make a call 
without leaving a charge (for a long-distance U.S. call or for an interna­
tional call) on someone else’s phone. Even if the cost isn’t all that high, 
the phone’s owner may be too polite to take money from you for the call, 
and you’re probably too polite to impose on them by taking them up on 
the offer, so the call just doesn’t get made. Go through the two-step dialing 
hassle to avoid leaving even a small charge on someone else’s bill.
	
You can greatly speed up the process of using Google Voice for long-distance 
calls with two tricks. The first trick is to set up a speed dial number on your 
landline phone(s) and cell phone for your Google Voice number. Doing this 
makes dialing out much quicker.
The second trick is to use your cell phone as a phone book, so you read out 
the number you need from your cell phone screen. You still have to dial, but 
you’re leveraging the hard work you do to keep your contacts current on 
your cell phone.

 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
Evangelizing Google Voice
Apple is the only non-religious organization 
we know of that has hired people with the job 
title of “evangelist” — someone to not only sell 
products, but actually get people to believe in 
a technology offering. If the evangelist does 
his job right, developers, customers, and other 
stakeholders don’t just buy Apple’s products, 
they think of new ways to use them and the 
technologies underlying them, provide feed­
back to the company on bugs and needed new 
features, or even start their own new company 
to build on the base offered by the technology.
Google Voice is the kind of offering that has 
the potential to make evangelists of its users 
because it’s well-designed, robust, and easy 
to use.
Some key Google Voice features including the 
ability to switch a call to a different phone, the 
ability to record calls, and the ability to set up a 
conference call only work for calls you receive 
on Google Voice, not for calls you make using 
Google Voice. (And they certainly don’t work for 
calls you make directly from a phone, bypassing 
Google Voice, even if the phone is registered 
with Google Voice.)
So that means you want people to call you, not 
for you to call them, so you have more flexibil­
ity. But why should they, if the call might cost 
them money? This is not as big a problem for 
cell phone calls, which usually are on plans that 
allow free nationwide calling. But it is for home 
phones (where the call might cost, depending 
on the plan it’s on) and for business phones 
(where the caller may not know whether there’s 
a cost or not but not want to risk hassle about it).
If you get your friends, family, and colleagues 
in the same country to use Google Voice, they 
can call you from any of their phones for free — 
and you can change phones, record the call, or 
create a conference call. Even better, if they 
use Google Voice, either of you can record the 
call and share the recording after, or either of 
you can host the conference call, so it matters 
less who called whom. (The callee is still the 
only one who can switch phones on the trot.)
All this may well make you an evangelist, get­
ting everyone around you to adopt Google Voice 
because it increases the functionality available 
to you, directly or with the help of your friends.
For callers from other countries, the issue is 
even bigger. International calls are very cheap 
for you to make through Google Voice, but they 
may be very expensive indeed for the party on 
the other end, for instance, the call is being 
made from a mobile phone (as they tend to say 
overseas) with no international calling plan. 
So they will be reluctant to call you unless it’s 
absolutely necessary. Instead, they may call 
you and ask you to call them straight back 
through Google Voice, once they know how 
cheap it is for you.
Now it’s time for some trickier evangelism. Get 
in touch with Google and let them know you 
want them to offer Google Voice in the coun­
tries you’re in touch with most often. You’ll be 
pushing on an open door. Google no doubt 
wants to expand their service area as well.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Using GOOG-411 from the voice menu
GOOG-411 is a Google directory assistance service for finding businesses. 
With the exception of the ugly-sounding and ugly-looking name, it’s great. It 
uses voice recognition and Google’s vast databases to help you get informa­
tion while you’re on the move or in a hurry.
	
GOOG-411 is free, unlike most directory assistance services. It doesn’t charge 
you for the search, and it doesn’t charge you after it connects you with a busi­
ness either. But, because it’s automated, the results may not be as useful to 
you as calling a live person via a paid-for directory assistance service. And it 
doesn’t include residential information.
GOOG-411 has gotten rave reviews. And Google keeps extending it; at this 
writing, the service has been extended to optionally include information 
about nearby intersections, help you orient yourself.
	
The technology developed for GOOG-411 powers Google Voice’s voicemail 
transcriptions as well. It is also promising as a possible front end for any 
Google search, not just a search for local businesses. (But even a big company 
like Google has to start somewhere.)
A Google vice president said, “The reason we really did it is because we need 
to build a great speech-to-text model. . . that we can use for all kinds of differ­
ent things, including video search.” For the research paper, visit: http://
research.google.com/archive/goog411.pdf.
You can use GOOG-411 from the Google Voice touchtone menu or by calling 
1-800-GOOG-411. (That’s 1-800-466-4411.) Or just dial into Google Voice and 
access GOOG411 from the voice menu.
We recommend that you use GOOG-411 through Google Voice. Why? Here goes:
	
✓	GOOG-411 text messages can be archived in Google Voice. Getting 
information by text message is a key feature of GOOG-411, but texts 
can only be received if you’re calling from a cell phone, unless you are 
calling via Google Voice, in which case the phone you’re calling from 
doesn’t matter. The text messages go to any and all cell phones that you 
have registered with Google Voice and to your Google Voice Inbox as 
well. From there, it’s easy to store them, forward them to people, or use 
them to drive looking up more information.
	
✓	GOOG-411 map links work better in Google Voice. Links to Google 
Maps (naturally) are a key feature of GOOG-411. But map links are use­
less on landline phones and only moderately useful on mobile phones, 
with their small screens. However, map links are fantastic on PCs; with 
Google Voice, you can get the map link on both.

141
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
So get in the habit of using GOOG-411 through Google Voice so that you can 
take advantage of your shortcuts to your Google number while getting all 
these cool features.
To access GOOG-411 from the Google Voice touchtone menu, follow these steps:
	
1.	Call your Google Voice number. If necessary to access your account, 
press * and enter your PIN.
	
	 If you’re calling from one of your registered phones that connects directly 
to your Google Voice account — usually, this is your cell phone — Google 
Voice will offer you options directly; if not, you need to press * and 
enter your PIN to access your account and hear options.
	
2.	Press 3 to access GOOG-411.
	
	 GOOG-411 asks you for your city and state.
	
3.	Say your city and state, or enter a five-digit zip code.
	
	 It’s not just what you tell GOOG-411, but how you tell it; speak slowly 
and clearly.
	
	 It’s good to enter the zip code if you know it and you’re not sure just 
how otherwise to describe your location. (For example, many areas are 
on the boundary between two towns, or you could know the large city 
you’re in but not which neighborhood.)
	
	 Don’t think you have to enter a zip code as a workaround if you have an 
accent, though; speech recognition systems working in limited domains, 
as in this case, are pretty good at cutting through accents.
	
	 GOOG-411 asks you for the business name or category. It sometimes per­
forms better on categories (surf shop) than business names (Zog’s Houz 
of Tubez).
	
4.	Say the name or type of the business. To spell the name or category, 
press 1, and then enter the name with the phone keypad.
	
	 (For example, “pizza” would be 74992 on your phone keypad.)
	
	 Google Voice responds with a list of businesses, clearly numbering 
them: “Number 1, …; number 2, …”.
	
5.	Respond by saying:
 
• “Number 1” or “Number 2”, or press the listing number, to get 
details of a specific listing.
 
• Add the phrase “text message” to get the business information as a 
text message.
 
• Add the phrase “map link” to have a map link sent to your phone.
 
• Add the phrase “details” to get cross streets.

142
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
	 The “number” part is important; speech recognition systems have a 
tough time with single-syllable words, including digits, whereas the 
“number” part makes it easier.
	
	 GOOG-411 connects you to the business and, if you requested, send you 
business information and, again if you requested, a map link.

page for GOOG-411 at:

The page is shown in Figure 7-1.
	
Using a cell phone with a headset is legal in most states, and Google Voice 
doesn’t demand that you use your phone keypad if you call directly, so it’s 
probably legal to use GOOG-411 while driving in a given state. However, the 
concentration needed to “format” your request, to speak it clearly, and to under­
stand and act on the information you get back, could be quite distracting. (For 
example, you could be momentarily tempted to make a bootleg turn if you 
just passed the pizza parlor you want!) Consider pulling over before calling 
GOOG-411 while in your car.
	
Microsoft has a similar service, which you can reach at 1-800-BING-411 (1-800-
246-4411). It includes directions. Try both to see which works better for you.

143
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
	
Don’t use GOOG-411, BING-411, or other such services for emergencies. Dial 
911 or another locally relevant emergency number.
If 911 doesn’t work on cell phones in your area, consider finding out your 
police hotline number and storing it on your cell.
Saving – or losing – on your 
cell phone text count
	
Google Voice can save you money on text messages, but if can also cost you 
money if you’re not careful.
Most people have monthly service plans for their cell phones, and many of 
these plans have fairly generous SMS text message allowances. But going 
over the limit, if you have one, is still expensive. And if you can reduce your 
text message count, you can potentially switch to a cheaper plan, or go on a 
pre-paid or post-paid plan in which you only pay for the texts, talk time, and 
data transfer you actually use.
Also, many people, especially younger people, have gotten in the habit of 
sending and receiving dozens (if not hundreds) of texts a day. Switching 
some of this to the PC, which is easier to type on, is easier on your eyes, 
wrists, and thumbs.
Here’s how Google Voice can cost you money on texts:
	
✓	Text message notifications: Google Voice can alert you to voicemail 
messages by sending a text message to one or more cell phones. These 
are additional text messages over and above what you’d normally get.
	
✓	Message multiplication: Google Voice sends a text message sent to your 
Google Voice number to as many cell phones as you set it up to. In the 
past, that message would have gone to just one phone. You might not 
have seen the message for a long time if it went to a less-used phone, but 
at least you wouldn’t be paying for it multiple times.
	
✓	Message expansion: Getting your text messages both through the Google 
Voice Web site and on one or more cell phones makes it easier for you to 
reply quickly, which may just elicit more messages and multiple copies.
Here’s how Google Voice can save you money on texts:
	
✓	Minimize text message notifications: Unfortunately, you can’t only 
get notified on messages from specific callers, but you can turn text 
message notifications off completely. You can rely on notifications by 
e-mail instead (especially if you have a cell phone with e-mail support).

144
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
✓	Turn off SMS support for some of your phones: On the Phones tab of 
the Settings area, select a mobile phone. You can turn off SMS from any 
of your cell phones, as shown in Figure 7-2.
	
✓	Turn off SMS support for all of your phones: You can turn off SMS sup­
port for Google Voice for all of your phones and just rely on the copies 
that show up by e-mail notification and in your Google Voice Inbox. This 
method is a particularly viable if you’re a responsible person who, like 
the authors, regularly checks for new e-mails on her smartphone.
See the next section for how to weave your SMS text strategy into your other 
money-saving plans.
	
Figure 7-2:

Can you go prepaid?
	
Being a technophile has always been expensive, but at least buying a PC puts 
the cost right up front, with the blow often softened by financing or the use of 
a credit card.
But cell phone pricing is sneakier. Most of us pay a (subsidized) cost of a cell 
phone — a nice, easy-sounding number like $99 or $199 — and easy-sounding 
monthly numbers like unlimited voice calls for $99, unlimited data for $30, 
and so on.
Only the small print reminds us that this is a commitment for, perhaps, two 
years, making the total cost more like $2,500, or more. And at the end of that 
two-year period, with phones changing so fast, you’re no doubt going to want 
to get a new phone and commit to a monthly plan all over again.

145
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
You can save money with more limited service plans, but if you go over the 
plan’s limits, the costs mount right back up. And overseas calls are often con­
siderable extras from any kind of plan. (A call to Europe might cost $1.50 a 
minute if not made within an international calling plan of some sort.)
Google Voice offers some relief right up front. Overseas calls are only a few 
cents a minute to most countries, almost eliminating one of the main poten­
tial “gotchas” in either a landline or cell phone bill. Text messages can be 
greatly reduced or even, with discipline, almost eliminated, as described in 
the previous section. And the ability to move calls from cell phones that may 
charge for minutes to landlines that don’t is a big plus.
	
But the big win is to get off the new cell phone plus monthly plan treadmill. 
Instead, consider getting an unlocked, mid-range, or refurbished cell phone 
and get a prepaid plan for it, then manage your minutes, texts, and data usage 
carefully. A goal might be to get a phone for up to $200 and keep monthly 
costs down to a maximum of $50, which has recently become a benchmark 
figure for contract-free services. Total two-year cost: $1400, about half the cost 
of a top of the line new phone and a high-end monthly plan.
In the following list, we look at the elements needed to move from the all-you-
can-eat plans to the hopefully less expensive a la carte plans:
	
✓	Phones: Unless you’re at a PC most of the time, Google Voice wants — 
almost needs — a smartphone that can receive e-mail. Budget $200 or so 
for a lower-end or refurbished smartphone.
	
✓	Minutes: Google Voice can help you cut cell phone minutes by spending 
more of your phone time on landlines and by using PC-based VOIP ser­
vices, especially Gizmo (see Chapter 11). Google Voice can also help you 
respond to voicemail messages by e-mail, avoiding minutes entirely.
	
✓	Texts: Used appropriately, as described in the previous section, Google 
Voice can help you cut your text count to almost nothing. Texts can be 
handled via a dialer application on your smartphone, using your data 
plan rather than counted as text messages, or on a PC for free. This 
leaves only a few texts and a small number of minutes to pay for.
	
✓	Data: This is the weak spot of an a la carte approach, as data costs are 
hard to predict and control. However, you can make good use of an unlim­
ited data plan that might cost about $30 a month by using a smartphone. 
With this you can handle many calls as e-mail on the phone or a PC.
If you like to talk, love having the newest phone, and hate sweating the small 
stuff, a new phone and a pay monthly service plan is probably the better bet. 
But if you like to use some of your technical expertise to find the best used 
or refurbished phone model, and like the prospect of using a new tool like 
Google Voice to save money as well as to do more, the a la carte approach 
may be very good for you.

146
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
If you have an employer-provided cell phone, much of your phone time is going 
to be paid for anyway. You can probably handle your personal needs on an a la 
carte basis.
Making Calls To and From 
Other Countries
Google Voice’s performance with overseas calls reminds one of a brief verse 
about a little girl with a little curl.
We don’t know if Google Voice has a little curl right in the middle of its virtual 
forehead, but the rest fits. Google Voice is very good indeed if you are in the 
U.S. and need to make calls to other countries, because it brings VOIP calling 
rates — a few cents a minute, in most cases — right onto all your phones, 
including your mobile phones in particular.
But when you’re traveling, Google Voice is horrid. Calls to your Google Voice 
number don’t ring your phone at all. Texts get to your Google Voice account 
online, but never reach your cell phone. There’s no amount of money you can 
pay or setting you can tweak to change this; it just doesn’t work.
Getting a SIM card or a whole phone for use in the country you’re visit­
ing doesn’t make any difference; Google Voice won’t forward calls to an 
American number when the phone is overseas, and it won’t forward calls to a 
foreign number at all. (Though this may change for Canadian numbers, which 
have the same +1 country code and the same formatting of area codes and 
local numbers as America, and for calls to Alaska and Hawaii, which are 100 
percent American, in the near future.)
Wi-Fi and VOIP calling
Most cell phones don’t yet support Wi-Fi (wide 
area network) support for voice over IP (VOIP) 
calling, and for those few that do, hotspot usage 
often carries costs of its own. VOIP calling over 
a PC, through services such as Skype, Gizmo 5, 
and Google Talk, is a real option though. This 
area is maturing rapidly, so it’s hard to give 
specific advice, but you can handle a good 
share of your phone needs at very low cost 
over VOIP today, and it’s only getting better. 
See Chapter 12 for specifics on Gizmo 5, a VOIP 
service that uses a virtual phone number and 
can therefore be thoroughly integrated with 
Google Voice. See Chapter 14 for specifics 
on Google Talk and how to use it in tandem with 
Google Voice.

147
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
So we have the agony and the ecstasy here. In the next section, we tell you 
how to add very small amounts of money to your Google Voice account to 
make very long calls to overseas numbers. We also explain how to manage 
when you’re overseas and your Google Voice number stops ringing through 
on your cell phone.
Adding credit where credit is due
Adding credit to your account is easy, using Google Checkout, a battle-tested 
and reliable online payments service used by thousands of merchants.
	
Google always adds credit in “chunks” of $10, which is a whopping 500 minutes 
to the cheapest countries, at 2¢ a minute, and about 20 minutes to the very few 
most expensive counties, which peak at 56¢ a minute — less than landline 
rates and far less than what some cell phone service providers charge. And 
you don’t need to specify what countries you’ll be calling in advance.
Google’s selling credit in $10 increments gives you plenty of time for the more 
common and less expensive calls, but cuts you off fairly quickly if you’re 
unknowingly clocking up minutes to a (relatively) expensive destination.
Follow these steps to add credit to your account:
	
1.	Click the Settings link in the upper part of your screen. Then click the 
Billing tab.
	
	 You see your current credit balance and a billing history, as shown in 
Figure 7-3.
	
Figure 7-3: 
Add credit 
before 
credit 
is due.
	

148
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
	 You may want to look at your billing history to decide whether to add 
just one $10 “chunk” of credit or more.
	
2.	Click the Add Credit link.
	
	 A Google Checkout screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-4. If you have 
a Google Account and are already signed into it, as you typically will be 
while using Google Voice, you will be asked to re-enter your password; 
if you do not have a Google Account yet, you’ll be asked for complete 
name, address, credit card and other details.
	
3.	If you are using an existing Google Account, type your password and 
click Sign in and continue. If you are creating a new Google Account, 
type the requested personal details, review the Terms of Service, and 
click Agree and Continue.
	
	 The final screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
	
4.	Set or clear checkboxes relating to e-mail offers and privacy. Type any 
coupon code you have and click Apply.
	
	 Most people, already receiving too much e-mail, will deselect the first 
and third checkboxes, which relate to special offers and promotional 
e-mail. The middle checkbox is the critical one. If you select it, your

for this transaction, as the seller is Google, but in other cases you may 
want to check this checkbox to shield your e-mail address from that spe­
cific seller. (Google handles the e-mail traffic between you and the seller 
in a way that keeps your e-mail address confidential.)

Checking the rates
You can check the calling rates by country from almost any screen in Google 
Voice. Your current account balance for long-distance calls appears in the 
left-hand panel. Simply click the Rates link under your balance to check cur­
rent rates by country.
	
There is often a dramatic difference in calling rates between landlines and 
mobile phones, even in the relatively low-cost world of Google Voice. For 
example, calls to a U.K. landline are 2¢ a minute; calls to a U.K. mobile phone, 
as the Brits call it, are 19¢ a minute.
	
The difference between a landline phone number and a mobile number is 
usually obvious to residents of the country, but not to outsiders. (In the U.K., 
mobile phone numbers begin with 075, 077, 078, or 079 at this writing.) So 
check the rates before calling and, if you need to, ask the recipient whether he 
is on a mobile; he’ll understand if you then keep the call brief.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Traveling to other countries
Managing phone calls when you travel has always been a small — or even a 
large — nightmare of inconvenience, expense, hassle, and missed opportunities. 
Google Voice helps in some ways, but makes things harder in others.
If, as in The Godfather, your boss “insists on hearing bad news at once,” here 
it is: if someone calls your Google Voice number while you’re in another 
country, your cell phone won’t ring. If someone sends you a text, it won’t 
appear on your cell phone.
There’s no setting you can change or payment you can make to make these 
basic things, the very core of what a telephone or cell phone does, happen. 
Except for one trick.
	
If you have a landline, direct all your Google Voice calls to your landline. Then 
have your phone company forward your landline to your cell phone. Doing this 
may cost some money, but it does work. Check what the costs are with the 
phone company.
Some advantages are worth listing:
	
✓	You won’t pay roaming charges for calls or texts you receive, because you 
won’t actually receive any calls or texts.
	
✓	People who call you according to your home time zone won’t wake 
you up at 3 a.m. in Istanbul or interrupt important business with trivia. 
(Those “wazzup?” calls from high school friends may not impress your 
foreign contacts, acquaintances, or family members.)
	
✓	Google Voice’s e-mail notifications, voicemail transcriptions, and cheap 
international calls can be quite helpful in keeping you in control.
The following section cover how to make Google Voice work for you, even 
when you’re abroad.
Using Google Voice in other countries
When traveling in other countries, you want to use Google Voice to save time 
and money and maintain control of when your phone rings and your costs. 
For this, you want to have either a smartphone with e-mail access or frequent 
access to a PC.
	
If you have e-mail access through your smartphone, through your dumb­
phone, or any other data transfer capabilities, check with your cell phone 
service provider before traveling. Phones often check for new data, and some 
people have been hit with bills for hundreds of dollars after a trip overseas. 
Establish how your phone works with regards to data, purchase a “travel 

153
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
abroad” add-on data plan to save money or learn how to turn off data access 
completely, and check your cell phone charges regularly during your trip.
After you’ve got your data costs under control, you can use Google Voice on 
your smartphone to manage many of your phone calls and texts via notifica­
tions and respond by e-mail. You can also use a PC instead. Given time zone 
differences, responding by e-mail is probably a better way to manage many 
interactions than actually receiving and making phone calls.
But how can you make real, live phone calls when you need to? Foreign coun­
tries tend to have more Internet cafés than the U.S., and VOIP calling with 
Skype is more popular. So when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and use an 
Internet café for international phone and video calls. It’s also common for 
hotels to have wireless Internet access — sometimes at high cost, so check 
when you book. Many also have business centers with PCs, Internet access, 
and printing capability.
	
Try to avoid using your hotel room phone for outgoing calls. Experienced 
travelers are aware of how easy it is for a brief phone call to stretch to 10 or 
20 stressful minutes, putting a hole in your wallet (or an embarrassing line on 
your expenses form) of $50 or more.
So Google Voice can help you handle most of your phone needs without actu­
ally using your phone. But what about those times when you really do need it?
Using your cell phone for calls overseas
You still may need to make or receive phone calls overseas. For making calls, 
consider calling your Google Voice number first.
	
Before you travel, contact your cell phone service provider to find out about 
prepaying or using an add-on to your plan to reduce charges for roaming calls 
from other countries to your Google Voice number in the U.S.
After you call (and pay for the call to) your Google Voice number, the onward 
part of the call from Google Voice to U.S. numbers will be free. It may also be 
cheaper to call numbers in your destination country by calling your Google 
Voice number in the U.S., and then making a call from it to your destination 
country at Google Voice’s low international rates.
So that takes care of making calls from your cell phone. First, get cheap rates 
for roaming calls back to the U.S. Then call via your Google Voice number to 
mask your cell phone’s number with your Google Voice number. This also 
gives you the onward part of your call free (to U.S. numbers) or at low rates 
(internationally).
What about receiving calls?

154
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
You can have people call your hotel room, with the hotel switchboard acting 
as your secretary. You can also have people call any businesses or friends 
you’re visiting. Of course, in these days of ubiquitous cell phone access, bor­
rowing a phone might get embarrassing.
In the worst case, you have two alternatives:
	
✓	Give out your “real” cell phone number and ask people to use it only 
while you’re traveling. This is cheaper and easier for your U.S.-based 
contacts.
	
✓	Rent a mobile phone in the country you’re traveling to; renting a phone 
is easier, less expensive, and more commonly done in most other countries 
than in the U.S. Renting a phone is especially good for your contacts in the 
country you’re visiting, as they then don’t have to make an international 
call to reach you.
	
In either case, you can’t forward the calls from Google Voice; it won’t ring your 
U.S.-based cell phone while you’re overseas, and it won’t forward calls to a 
foreign number.
	
You can use Google Voice to soft forward calls. Just leave a message — for 
selected people only, if you prefer — stating that you’re traveling, the time dif­
ference, and the number you’re using while traveling. (Your “real” cell phone 
number or your rent-a-phone number.) Doing this not only gives people a 
way to reach you, it might help them call you at sensible times and only when 
really needed.
A checklist for the Google Voice-equipped traveler
Managing phone calls while you’re traveling is never easy. Here’s a checklist 
for reducing hassle and expense by using your usual cell phone and, if you 
wish, an additional rented local phone. Use some or all of these techniques 
as needed:
	
✓	Before you travel, contact your cell phone provider. Ask for add-ons 
to reduce costs of data transfer while roaming, so you can manage voice 
call and text notifications via mobile e-mail and buy an add-on to reduce 
the cost of calls back to your Google Voice number while roaming, so 
you can cheaply make calls after dialing into Google Voice.
	
✓	Use your own cell phone. Before you travel, set up Google Voice voice­
mail messages, customized as appropriate. A suggested script: “While 
traveling, I’ll have limited phone access, so please send e-mail or leave a 
voicemail message. If urgent, call me on…” and give the time difference 
and your cell phone number.

155
 Chapter 7: Saving Time and Money
	
✓	Use a rented phone. After you reach your destination, rent a mobile 
phone or rent a SIM card if you have a phone that uses the local cell 
phone technology standard. Set up Google Voice voicemail messages, 
customized as appropriate, giving the temporary mobile phone number 
as your “urgent” number.
	
✓	Avoid using the phone. Use your cell phone’s e-mail capability, Internet 
cafés, wireless access in your hotel and any business center your hotel 
has to manage your voice message and text notifications, respond by 
e-mail or using Google Voice’s texting capability, and make calls using a 
VOIP service such as Skype, Google Talk, or Gizmo 5.
These techniques allow you to operate with the least cost and inconvenience 
for yourself and the least change in habits for your callers.

G
oogle Voice changes the way you use your phones. You can begin Google 
Voice calls by dialing into Google Voice from your phone, by using a 
Google Voice dialer app, or by using the Google Voice mobile Web page from 
any cell phone with even a basic Web browser.
This chapter explains how to use Google Voice from your phone or from the 
Google Voice Web site to make calls and send text messages. We describe a 
couple of very cool things you can do with your Google Voice phone number 
and call recordings on the Web. We then tell you about the exciting things 
you can do with calls that come to you through Google Voice.
This chapter is the last one to cover the basic information on how to set up 
and use Google Voice — which has taken up eight chapters and more than 
half the book!
If you’re brand new to Google Voice, consider going through this chapter a 
couple of times; once to get a feel for what Google Voice can do, then again 
to actually try the things that you want to use right away. Learning takes 
time, but you’re likely to find that the investment of time you make is well-
rewarded with Google Voice.

158
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Calling with Google Voice Is Different
The biggest issue that Google Voice presents users seems to be the added 
steps in dialing out. Understanding exactly what’s involved and how to work 
around it may help you get more out of Google Voice.
The first step in getting the most out of Google Voice is to get people to call 
your Google Voice number. This is like herding cats; people are likely to 
revert to old habits. However, if you do your part, you may be able to make 
this stick.
After you get people calling you on your Google Voice number, the key to 
using Google Voice successfully is always making calls from Google Voice. 
That way, people see your Google Voice number as the number you called 
from and, when they return calls, they come back to you through Google Voice. 
You have to do this consistently to get the advantages that Google Voice 
offers you.
However, consistently calling from Google Voice is hard work. The most 
unusual aspect of Google Voice is that to place a call from a phone, you call 
your Google Voice number first, then Google Voice calls first you, and con­
nects you to the other party. This change in how phone calls work is discon­
certing at first.
Even after you get used to the change in how things work, the extra effort 
is daunting for many. It’s enough to put many people off using Google Voice 
consistently for their outgoing calls. But if you start returning calls directly 
to one or more of your phones without using Google Voice and you’ll lose the 
advantages, too.
Using Google Voice consistently is easier when calling from a smartphone 
using a dialer, as we describe in Part III. The extra work is eliminated — you 
enter a number, and then the dialer calls Google Voice for you. After that step 
is saved, a dialer that closely mimics the way the smartphone works when 
not using Google Voice — giving easy access to contacts and so on — gives 
you an almost unchanged experience compared to calling directly from your 
cell phone. There’s still the change in interaction, with Google Voice calling 
you and then the other party, but that by itself is not a stopper.
Dialing out using Google Voice
	
It’s relatively easy to dial out using Google Voice if you have a smart phone, 
or even from a dumbphone that can run a browser, by using the Google Voice 
mobile Web site. But what if you have a dumb phone, or if you want to use a 
landline for the call to save cell phone minutes or get better call quality, take 

159
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
advantage of your landline handset’s features, and/or have a more 
comfortable call?
The indirect way to do this is to use your cell phone and the Google Voice 
Mobile Web page or a cell phone dialer application (see Part III) to drive calls to 
your landline phone. On your cell phone, enter the number you’re dialing — you 
can often pick it out of your contacts — then use the scrolling list in the dialer 
to specify your landline as the ringback number. Google Voice rings your land­
line first and, after you pick up, it calls the number you’re trying to reach. So 
your cell phone works as a remote control for landline phones!
Figure 8-1 shows a Blackberry user choosing a dialer application to route a 
call through a landline phone.
	
Figure 8-1: 
Start your 
outbound 
call on your 
cell phone 
and 
continue it 
on a 
landline.
	
Another, complementary method is to set up your Google Voice number as 
a speed dial number on your phone. Many phones have a speed dial feature. 
Unfortunately, for many landline phones and office phone systems, the speed 
dial feature is just hard enough to use that some of us never use it. (The fact 
that speed dial works slightly differently on different systems is much of 
the problem.)
	
Take the time to set up a speed dial to Google Voice on all your phones. Then 
use your cell phone as a mobile directory. Doing this allows you to most easily 
make free (in the U.S.) or cheap (international) calls wherever you are.
	
When you use Google Voice, you can use any landline to make your call. 
As long as you’re in the same area code, or the phone you’re using has free 
national long distance, you won’t leave behind an unpleasant reminder of your 
visit in the form of a line on someone else’s bill. You can even borrow a mobile 
for an international call; you will be burning minutes, but not running up a 
potentially huge bill on someone else’s phone.

160
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Using forwarding for Google Voice
	
Forward your home phone, business phone, and mobile phone to your Google 
Voice number to save some of the effort of getting people to call you on Google 
Voice. Then set up Google Voice so that it doesn’t ring any external phones. 
(You can’t have Google Voice ring a phone that’s forwarded to Google Voice.)
The bad news is that, if you do this without making any other changes, none 
of your phones will ever ring. If you are phone-phobic, this is not a bad thing.
You can still make calls from all your phones; you can even use them to call 
Google Voice and then dial out from there, keeping up the Google Voice illu­
sion that you need to preserve for people who might call you back. But you 
can’t receive calls directly through your Google Voice number.
We doubt that many of you are willing to do this full-time. But it might be 
useful when you’re very busy or unavailable (for example, during a trip).
Landline phones can be frustrating!
People have missed an important point about 
the popularity of cell phones. It’s great that 
they’re mobile, yes, but they’re also just plain 
better phones than landline phones in many 
ways. Even the simplest cell phones make it 
much easier to call people back, keep contact 
phone numbers, and more.
I (Smith) have as a home phone a Supersonic 
XZ-FC245. (Slightly renamed to protect the 
guilty.) The main body of the unit has a built-in 
fax machine and copier and a decent handset 
attached. This handset preserves the curve 
that traditional phones have always had, 
which puts the earpiece close to your ear and 
the mouthpiece close to your mouth, giving you 
comfort, clarity, and privacy (on the incoming 
part of the call).
But the mobile handsets that come with the 
phone, and that I actually use most of the time, 
are mobile-phone-like: straight, with no com­
forting curve. The handsets are at least longer 
than a typical cell phone, which helps.
When I tried to figure out how to set up speed 
dial on this phone, it wasn’t pretty. The manual 
is long gone, and I couldn’t find it online. (How 
do I know if it’s a 2.4Ghz phone or a 5.8GHz 
phone, or maybe an expandable system?) 
[Modern household phones are predominantly 
2.4Ghz.]
Finally, pushing buttons, I was able to put my 
Google Voice number in the thing’s on-board 
phonebook. Not as good as just pressing one 
button, but not bad. Hopefully you’ll have better 
luck with your phones!

161
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
If you take an extra step, you can make this work better. Forward all your 
existing phone numbers to Google Voice; then get a new cell phone SIM card. 
Put the old SIM card someplace safe. Then put the new SIM card in your cell 
phone and assign Google Voice to ring the new number when you want to 
receive calls. That way, people who call your previous cell phone number are 
patched into Google Voice, and Google Voice can make your cell phone ring 
by using the new number.
Figure 8-2 is a conceptual diagram of how incoming calls flow to your new 
SIM card and phone number.
	
When using this workaround always use the Google Voice Web site, a Google 
Voice dialer, or dial into your Google Voice number by phone to make calls 
from the new cell phone. That way, you preserve the Google Voice illusion for 
people who note your number and call you back. Otherwise you have to forward 
the new number to Google Voice, too, and get yet another new SIM card!
But with this approach, if you’re conscientious, you can save some of the 
effort of getting people to call you on Google Voice. You lose the ability to 
move incoming phone calls to your usual work and home landlines, but you 
get all of Google Voice’s other capabilities and control, all the time.

With this approach, you can’t have Google Voice ring any of the phones that 
are forwarded to it; Google Voice doesn’t allow that kind of circular logic. This 
may cost you cell phone minutes on your new SIM, because you can’t reassign 
incoming cell phone calls to your landline as you might otherwise do.
	
Always keep any phone SIM card someplace safe and easy to remember. 
They’re obviously easy to lose, and surprisingly easy to damage, outside the 
protective casing of a phone.
Porting a phone number to Google Voice
Google Voice already offers outbound phone number portability: that is, 
portability of your Google Voice number to another provider, such as a cell 
phone provider. This feature is Google’s insurance for people with tepid 
interest: they know that they can try having Google Voice in their life for a 
while, and if they don’t like it, they don’t have to abandon their new number 
when they go elsewhere.
And although outbound portability is nice, what people really want is 
inbound phone number portability. That means the ability to move your cell 
phone number to Google Voice.
What would inbound phone number portability do for you? It would mean 
that people could keep calling your cell phone to reach you. People are get­
ting increasingly stubborn about not giving up their cell phone numbers; 
young people today often seem bent on keeping theirs for life. Younger 
people often have cell phone numbers with the area code based not on the 
city where they all live and work, but on where they come from.
So having your cell phone number become your Google Voice number is 
attractive. With this feature, you keep your business cards the same and your 
friends, colleagues, family, old boyfriends, and girlfriends can keep using the 
same old number because you get the calls through Google Voice.
	
Some people say that the central benefit to porting your number into Google 
Voice is that you won’t have to change your business cards. However, true 
Google Voice fans will end up changing their business cards anyway, as people 
who get used to Google Voice don’t like to list any other numbers. They want 
all calls to them to come in through Google Voice.
However, if you port your current number to GV, your old phone is left without 
a number; the carrier will have to assign it a new one. If you port your phone 
number to Google Voice, then keep your new, actual cell phone number totally 
secret. Try to ensure that no one but yourself ever has it, because if they do, 
they’ll call your cell phone directly, bypassing all the convenience and control 
that Google Voice gives you.

163
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
And this rule applies to outgoing calls, too — to maintain the illusion, you 
have to dial Google Voice first, then your outbound number. A dialer program 
on your cell phone can shorten the steps but not eliminate the difference.
	
A Google Voice phone number is in an important sense not a real phone 
number. It’s not tied to a real phone but just calls up specific associations 
and service in the network of servers that store Google’s information. What’s 
really needed is full phone number portability and integration. Not only would 
your cell phone number become your Google Voice number; it would also 
remain your “true” native cell phone number. Calls from your cell phone 
would be direct calls out and would still display your Google Voice number as 
your cell phone number, because they would be one and the same.
Because Google makes a cell phone operating system, Android, that’s already 
running on over 1 million phones, this kind of capability may be made avail­
able soon.
Unfortunately, this capability still wouldn’t solve the entire problem. If you 
wanted to use a landline for outgoing calls, you would still have to dial your 
Google Voice number first.
What you really need is the ability to spoof any phone you choose to appear 
as if it were just another phone using the same Google Voice number. This is 
currently illegal in many jurisdictions, because it can be used to perpetrate 
fraud. There may be a workaround that eventually allows many phones to 
simply work as extensions on your Google Voice number. But until then 
you’ll still have to do extra work to take full advantage of both Google Voice 
and all the phones around you.
Other people’s problems
Some people, usually more technically minded, 
love the features of Google Voice and the con­
trol it gives them so much that they don’t mind 
the extra work.
For many others, the extra steps and the differ­
ences in the model of how phones work with 
Google Voice present too much mental effort to 
be practical in day-to-day scenarios.
So if you’re a classic early adopter type, or just 
love Google Voice, you may find Google Voice 
to be powerful, capable, and fun to use even in 
its initial state. Those who are not may want to 
wait until more integration with existing phones 
is offered or until everyone they know is using 
Google Voice and they feel more comfortable 
joining in.

Using the Google Voice 
Web Site for Calls
Many people have gotten in the habit of using a computer for phone calls and 
even video calls due to Skype, Google Talk, and similar services. The easiest 
way to use Google Voice for making calls or sending texts is to make the call 
or send the text from your computer, assuming you’re near one that is con­
nected to the Internet. This way, the call or text comes directly from your 
Google Voice number, without extra steps.
	
Calls to domestic numbers from Google Voice are free; calls to international 
numbers are at very low rates (see Chapter 7). Texts sent from Google Voice 
can only be delivered to U.S. cell phones and are free as well for the sender. 
Neither calls nor SMSs sent from Google Voice count against your cell phone 
airtime minutes or text message limits, a further savings. (But they may count 
against the recipient’s.)
	
You can’t send an SMS text message to an international number from Google 
Voice. You may be tempted to send an SMS directly from your cell phone, but 
doing so may be expensive and will reveal your cell phone number, distracting 
the person from consistently using your Google Voice number. Consider 
sending a (free) e-mail message instead.
Going back to the future 
with Google Voice
In the movie Back to the Future, Marty McFly goes back in time to the years 
before he was born and ends up a spectator to his parents’ budding romance. 
While nothing that upsetting is likely to happen to you while using Google 
Voice, it may make you pine for the days of landline telephones.
Many people, especially young adults in what’s called Gen Y, don’t have a land­
line, but use their cell phone instead. If you’re one of these cell-only minimalists, 
you may find that, with Google Voice available, you suddenly want a landline 
in your life. Or, if you already have a landline, you may want another one.
Google Voice’s ability to ring several phones at once or, by pressing the * key 
during an incoming call, to switch it to any of “your” phones gives you the 
option of switching between phones, taking away all the inconvenience that 
once defined hard-wired phones.

165
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
Why would you want a (or another) landline? Here are a few reasons:
	
✓	Landline phones don’t use your cell phone plan’s minutes.
	
✓	Landline phones have gotten extremely cheap since cell phones became 
widely used.
	
✓	Landlines don’t use up your cell phone’s battery.
	
✓	Landlines have a more reliable connection (this will be a clincher for 
some cell phone users).
	
✓	Landlines are more comfortable.
	
✓	Landlines have other features lacking in Google Voice, such as 
conference calling on outbound calls.
	
✓	Landline phones have better speakerphones.
These features make for more relaxed, more enjoyable, and less tiring phone 
calls. And these features may encourage you to be on the phone longer, for 
better or worse.
	
You may find that you are not only more comfortable but that you save 
money by having a landline, or an additional landline, versus doing without 
it. Certainly if you make business calls on your cell phone, and have a better 
quality of conversation by switching some of those to a landline, you may 
make more money, even if you don’t save money directly.
	
As mentioned above, you can use Google Voice Mobile or another cell phone 
dialer application to drive calls to your landline phone. Just specify your land­
line as the ringback number, and Google Voice can connect the call through to 
your landline instead of to your cell phone.
Calling or texting from the 
Google Voice Web site
The people at Google use the term Click2Call for making a call from the 
Google Voice Web site. You can Click2Call or send a text from the Web site:
	
✓	From your Contacts
	
✓	From a Google Voice message
	
✓	From the body of a Google Voice message transcript
	
✓	For calls only: from the Call box on the Google Voice Web site. (That’s 
an accidental pun, as a “call box” is a box, usually metal, with a phone in 
it that only dials a predetermined number.)
	
✓	For SMS text messages only: from the SMS button on the Google Voice 
Web site. (No pun intended or committed.)

166
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
If you’re familiar with the quality of automatic transcripts of voice messages 
in general, or even of Google Voice’s voicemail transcripts in particular, dial­
ing a phone number from within a Google Voice voicemail transcript may 
sound like a joke.
	
However, in the computer version of “let’s put our best people on it,” Google 
Voice has apparently devoted extra computational resources and its very best 
algorithms to decoding phone numbers. Phone numbers are therefore more 
likely to be correct than the rest of the text.
	
So it’s quite likely that you can successfully use the decoded phone numbers 
in voicemail transcriptions to return calls. If you’re concerned, listen to the 
voicemail message and check the transcription against what you hear. In some 
cases you may not be sure what’s being said either!
Calling your Contacts
Making a call to one of your Contacts from the Google Voice Web site is easy:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site.
	
2.	Click Contacts in the left-hand pane.
	
	 A list of your contacts appears.
	
3.	Click the needed group and then click the name of the contact you 
want to call.
	
	 The contact name and phone number(s) appears.
	
4.	Click the call link next to the phone number you want to use.
	
	 The Make a Call dialog appears and displays the number you’ve 
selected, as shown in Figure 8-3.
	
5.	Use the pull-down menu to choose which of your phones to ring.
	
6.	If you want to always ring the same phone on calls to this person, 
select the Remember my choice checkbox to set it.
	
	 You will still have access to the pull-down list when making a call 
from your Contacts, but the default will be determined by the selection 
that was in force when you clicked Remember my choice.
	
	 When you get a message from this person, the choice you make here is 
be preselected as well.
	
7.	Click Connect.
	
	 The dialog box disappears, and the call is connected.
Replying to calls and texts
Replying to a call or text to your Google Voice number is even easier than 
making a call, whether it comes from a Contact or not. Follow these steps:

167
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
	
1.	From the Google Voice Web site, click in the left-hand pane to access 
your overall Inbox, your Voicemail, or your SMS In box, as shown in 
Figure 8-4.
	
	 A list of your incoming messages appears, showing all your messages 
in your Inbox (shown in Figure 8-4) or only your voice messages or SMS 
text messages if you chose one or the other.
	
2.	Scroll to the call or text message you want to reply to.
	
3.	Click the Reply button to be given a choice between calling or reply­
ing with an SMS text message.
	
	 For SMS text messages only, and to reply directly by text without making 
a choice, click the Reply link below the message, not the Reply button to 
the upper right. You can see the Reply link and button on the same SMS 
text message in Figure 8-4.
	
	 Unlike in some other countries, the American (and Canadian) phone 
numbering system does not give you or Google Voice any way to 
distinguish between a landline (which, as a rule, cannot receive text 
messages) and a cell phone (which can) based on the number alone. 
Be aware that if you send an SMS text message to a phone you’re not 
sure of, and the phone turns out to be a landline, the message will not 
be received. (This problem occurred a great deal with the old Grand 
Central service that predated Google Voice, because it simply ignored 
incoming text messages.)

4.	Choose Call or SMS.
	
	 If you choose Call, the same dialog as shown in Figure 8-1 appears; if you 
choose Text, a dialog for texting appears, as shown in Figure 8-5.

 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
	
5.	If calling, choose which of your phones to ring and, optionally, click 
in the checkbox to remember your choice; then click Connect.
	
	 The phone you chose will ring; pick it up and then Google Voice will dial 
the party you’re calling.
	
6.	If texting, enter your message and then click Send.
	
	 Equipped with a computer keyboard and the ability to easily cut and 
paste, it may be tempting to go well over the 160-character limit for a 
single text message. Resist temptation!
	
There’s no easily available shortcut that you can use to transfer phone num­
bers you enter into the Call or SMS boxes, or phone numbers that appear in 
messages, into contacts. However, we recommend that you take the extra time 
to create contacts because doing so makes dealing with calls from these num­
bers in the future much easier. (If you are using call screening, it will be easier 
for the caller as well, because they won’t potentially have to state their name 
when calling.)
Using the Call button
Using the Call button is very similar to calling a contact or replying to a call:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site.
	
2.	Click the Call button.
	
	 You are presented with the Call balloon, as shown in Figure 8-6.
	
Figure 8-6: 
Use the Call 
balloon for a 
quick call.
	

170
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
3.	Enter the phone number you want to use.
	
	 You can cut and paste the number if you have it on your computer.
	
4.	Use the pull-down menu to choose which of your phones to ring.
	
5.	If you want to always ring the same phone on calls to this person, 
click the checkbox, Remember my choice, to set it as the default.
	
6.	Click Connect.
	
	 The dialog disappears, and the call is connected.
Using the SMS button
Using the SMS button is very similar to texting a contact or replying to a call 
or text via SMS:
	
1.	Open the Google Voice Web site.
	
2.	Click the SMS button.
	
	 You are presented with the SMS balloon, as shown in Figure 8-7.
	
3.	Enter the phone number you want to use.
	
	 Be sure it’s an SMS number; if you can’t be sure, you can still send an 
SMS, but be prepared to follow up in other ways as well.
	
Figure 8-7: 
Use the 
SMS bal-
loon for a 
quick text.
	

171
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
	
4.	Enter the message.
	
	 Sending SMS text messages from Google Voice is free, but that doesn’t 
mean people want to pay for or take the time to read extra-long text 
messages. Take the 160-character limit seriously.
	
5.	Click Send.
	
	 The dialog disappears, and the text is sent.
	
Whether you enter the phone number from the Google Voice Web site or 
by using a dialer from a smartphone, you can only enter domestic U.S. num­
bers in the classic ten-digit format: a three-digit area code and a seven-digit 
number. Doing this prevents you from using some shorter numbers, such as 
when you’re requested to SMS a confirmation code for online banking and 
other transactions, or for using Twitter. In these cases, you need to use your 
cell phone directly throughout the transaction, and not Google Voice.
What the HTML is going on here?
As you use Google Voice more and more, you 
may get a bit tired of repeating the mouse clicks 
needed to reach Settings, Contacts, and other 
areas in the Google Voice site.
If you know a bit of HTML, you can make your­
self a convenient control panel for Google 
Voice that goes to key parts of Google Voice 
with many fewer clicks. Just create a Web 
page whose text is the names of the parts of 
Google Voice you want to reach. Then link the 
appropriate URL from that area to the text.
In fact, you don’t even need to know HTML. You 
can do the same thing in most word proces­
sors, including any non-antediluvian version 
of Microsoft Word. Just type the text you want 
to appear in your control panel. Then use the 
menus to assign a URL to each piece of text. (In 
Word, the command is Insert ➪ Hyperlink; the 
shortcut in Windows is Ctrl+K).
Any part of the Google Voice Web site that has 
its own unique URL can be linked to from an 
HTML page that you create. Individual Contacts 
and Groups do not have their own unique URLs, 
so you can’t link to specific people or specific 
groups.
Whether you create the file directly in HTML 
or by using a word processor, save it to your 
hard drive. (In Word, be sure to use the option 
Save as Web page if you want to open the file 
in a browser.) Then open the resulting file in a 
browser.
If you want to use the file on your smartphone, 
you can either transfer it to your smartphone 
or publish it to the Web if you have a hosting 
account, or use a free host such as Blogger. 
(No one else can use it unless they know how 
your username and password to sign into 
your Google account.) Once on the Web, you 
can surf to the page and then use it to access 
Google Voice functions with a single click. 
(After the clicks needed to sign into your Google 
account, of course.)
Some of you older nerds out there may recog­
nize a similarity between this and the old .BAT 
batch files that some of us used to create in 
DOS. Some of you younger nerds will not know 
what any of the previous sentence means. Be 
(mostly) thankful.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Getting (Secret) Calls from the Web
	
You can use Google Voice to easily create a Call Widget, which is HTML code 
that appears on a Web page as a button labeled “Call Me.” The HTML code 
that can be placed in any Web page you control, such as your blog. When the 
Web page user clicks the button, Google Voice connects to the caller’s phone 
and then calls one or more of your phones.
A Call Widget hides your number, so the person who calls never sees it. And 
the call can be set up to go straight to voicemail or to ring one or more of 
your phones, all of the time or at different times of day.
A Call Me button is much cheaper than setting up a free 800 number but is 
just as effective and more flexible — backed by all the capabilities of Google 
Voice, including flexible ringing of phones, customizable voicemail greetings, 
voicemail transcriptions, text message alerts, and more. And just like any 
other phone call, you can see the number of whoever is calling you on your 
phone’s caller ID. It also gets logged in your Google Voice account.
	
The good news is that the HTML code for the Call Me button does not show 
your number in plain sight. However, it can be decoded or otherwise hacked 
from the HTML. This useful feature has the ability to hide phone numbers but 
it is not bulletproof.
	
Although hiding your Google Voice number can be a good thing, you don’t 
have to hide it. You can also give the number in plain sight on the Web page. 
This gives Web page visitors the option of calling directly, which will be more 
familiar to them, and also gives them the option of sending a text. (You should 
make this clear in the text on the Web page; for example, use text like this: 
“Click the Call Me button to call us for free, or call or text directly to. . . ”.)
	
Following is the HTML code for an example Call Widget, for your amusement:
<object type=”application/x-shockwave-flash” 
data=”https://clients4.google.com/voice/embed/
webCallButton” width=”230” height=”85”><param 
name=”movie” value=”https://clients4.google.
com/voice/embed/webCallButton” /><param 
name=”wmode” value=”transparent” /><param 
name=”FlashVars” value=”id=5e52fdd1c86ca89477c9
1f43c31a7ab3e35609db&style=0” /></object>
Follow these simple steps to set up a Call Widget:
	
1.	Go to the Google Voice Web site.
	
2.	Click the Settings link.

173
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
	
3.	Click the Call Widgets link.
	
	 The Call Widgets area appears, as shown in Figure 8-8.
	
Figure 8-8:

	 The fields for adding a Call Widget appear, as shown in Figure 8-9.
	
Figure 8-9:

your Call

174
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
5.	Specify the settings for your Call Widget: Name, which phones to ring 
(or send straight to voicemail), which greeting to use, and whether to 
use Call Presentation.
	
	 Remember that you can assign a ringing schedule to a phone, so you can 
assign the Call Widget to a phone that only rings at certain times of day. 
It’s the World Wide Web, and prospects — or suspects — could call you 
at any time of the day or night!
	
	 Consider having a special greeting just for Call Widget users that’s 
specific to them, such as: “Thank you for calling us from the Call Me 
button on our Web site. Please leave a message describing. . .”
	
6.	Click Save Changes to create the Call Widget or Cancel to stop 
the process.
	
	 Your Call Widget appears in your list of Call Widgets.
	
7.	Select the code next to the prompt, Embed. Place this code in any 
Web page you care to.
	
8.	Test the Call Widget to make sure that it works and that it rings the 
correct phones and triggers the right voicemail message. Consider 
how the phone will be staffed. Take responsibility for the user’s entire 
experience when they use the Call Widget.
	
Consider inviting your Web visitors to give you feedback about their experi­
ence using the Call Widget. Otherwise, any problems with the experience 
could go undetected until a long time has passed and quite a few customers 
have gone away angry or confused.
To edit a Call Widget, follow the same steps, but begin by clicking Edit under 
an existing widget rather than clicking the Add a new Call Widget link.
	
Be sure to use the other features of Google Voice in conjunction with Call 
Widgets, such as voicemail transcriptions. These features can help you deliver 
a superior, “right first time” response to your callers.
	
You might want to consider setting up a special Google Voice account with its 
own phone number to connect Call Widgets to your business phone number. 
Be aware, though, that you may run into two limitations of Google Voice: you 
can only assign any one phone number to a single Google Voice account, and 
you can’t assign a Google Voice number to a phone extension. The use of a 
business phone number with Google Voice demands some thought and
 planning, as explained in Chapter 15.
	
Consider getting a specific phone line just for your Call Widget to ring to. Then 
you can control the ring times for this phone specifically in tune with the 
needs of your Web visitors and yourself!

175
 Chapter 8: Managing Phones with Google Voice
Forwarding Voicemail Messages 
and Recordings
	
You can easily e-mail any Google Voice voicemail message or recording, or put 
it on the Web.
Google Voice stores both types of recordings and sends you a link. You can 
easily download the audio file and edit it, and you can do all sorts of things 
with the link, including forwarding it to people via e-mail.
You can also put the link to the stored file, or a new link to the downloaded 
(and possibly edited) file, on an intranet page, or even a public-facing Web 
page for all the world to hear. There are some times when this is a good idea 
and some times when it’s a lousy one.
A time when it’s a good idea is when you have a meeting with several people, 
but additional people can’t attend. You can send them a link to a recording of 
the meeting. You can even edit the recording to catch the high points.
A time when it might be a bad idea is when you record a customer service 
call, and the customer gets angry in a way that strikes you as funny, and the 
idea hits that you can put this on the Web and have a good laugh about it 
with your Web site visitors.
	
You can make people hurt, upset, and really, really angry if you surprise them 
by publicly sharing a recording of them on a phone call. They might even 
threaten to sue. Think through any potential embarrassments before doing 
this. In some cases, you may want to ask for permission.

Handling Calls
In This Chapter
▶	Using the Inbox folder
▶	Handling message notifications
▶	Working with options for incoming calls
▶	Finding out how to register emergency phone numbers
▶	Using keyboard commands
G
oogle Voice does so much for you, but you need to take the time to 
master all of the features to get the most from the service. During the 
early, steep part of the learning curve, you may wonder who’s working for 
whom — Google Voice for you, or you for Google Voice!
We’ve all had the experience of trying to remember the location of a com­
mand or how to use a feature. Google Voice includes commands for its Web 
interface, for the Google Voice dialers on mobile phones, and even com­
mands that only work from a phone. With options scattered about, taking 
advantage of all of them can be confusing.
This chapter brings together the options for the parent of all Google Voice 
interfaces, the Google Voice Inbox. We go through each option thoroughly 
and to a moderate level of detail, so that you can master the tool.
This chapter also describes keyboard commands and emergency phone 
registration, a quick and dirty process that can only be initiated from a 
phone, by calling your Google Voice voice mailbox. (It can be cancelled 
online or by phone.)
We conclude with Google Voice keyboard commands, the power user‘s tool
for getting around within Google Voice and other Google services more quickly.

178
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
Using the Google Voice Inbox
The Google Voice Inbox is much like Gmail. The Google Voice Inbox is long-
term storage for all your voice messages. This record only becomes more 
valuable with time and increased use, as it accumulates more information 
you can retrieve when you need it.
The Google Voice Inbox is easy to use and clean. In fact, we prefer it to Gmail’s 
interface, which is highly capable but crowded and busy. The Google Voice inter­
face might be Google’s second best so far, after the stripped-down Google 
Search home page. (The Google Search home page is particularly notable 
because it initially appeared around the turn of the century, at a time when 
search rivals were creating complex home pages on busy portals at a rapid rate.)
Like others among the best interfaces, the Google Voice interface incorpo­
rates tremendous amounts of functionality presented as simple options for 
the user. We look at it in two parts: the individual message notifications for 
calls and text messages and then the controls and options surrounding the 
notifications.
	
This book and the Google Help documentation refer to the Inbox as all views 
on Google Voice notifications, even views through folders other than the Inbox, 
as shown in Figure 9-1. We follow that practice here as well; the Inbox is both 
any view that shows Google Voice notifications (basically, any view that isn’t 
Settings) and the specific Inbox folder, which only shows notifications you 
haven’t archived, marked as spam, or deleted. When we refer specifically to 
the Inbox folder, we call it the Inbox folder.
Message notifications
The Google Voice Inbox includes text message exchanges, call notifications, 
voicemail message transcriptions and links to call recordings.
	
Figure 9-1:

Voice Inbox

depths.
	

179
 Chapter 9: Using the Inbox and Handling Calls
A Google Voice Inbox message includes several elements that are worth 
paying attention to:
	
✓	Originating phone number and contact name and Add link: Google 
Voice uses caller ID to get the incoming phone number and uses your 
Contacts list to associate a name with it. If the phone number is not 
associated with a contact, Google presents an Add link option to let you 
add it to a new contact or an existing one.
	
Use e-mail instead of a return call or SMS text message to deal with calls 
whenever it makes sense. There’s no direct link to do this, but it only takes 
two clicks to do it for existing contacts: Click the contact’s name to see con­
tact details; click the contact’s e-mail address to send an e-mail. See the “The 
Missing Link” sidebar for details.
	
✓	Date and time of the call; number of days ago: A very useful feature 
that would be even more useful if it included the day of the week. (A 
three-letter abbreviation would do nicely, pretty please, Google?) 
We tend to remember when, for example, a work colleague calls on a 
Saturday, and that would be a lot easier to scan for than a date. The 
number of days ago does help, though.
	
✓	Star marker: You can star a message by clicking the barely visible star 
outline that appears way over to the right within the message notifica­
tion. (On a widescreen laptop, where you might display your Inbox full-
screen, you may miss the outline entirely.)
	
	Everyone uses (or ignores) stars in their own way. Starred voicemails 
are one of four classes of messages: Starred, regular Inbox messages, 
messages in the History folder, and deleted messages. Starred messages 
show up in the Inbox; they are the only messages in the Starred area, 
and they show up in History as well.
	
✓	SMS — more messages link: Google Voice displays the most recent mes­
sage exchange and makes others available through a link; clicking the 
link expands the exchange. The current and past messages are rolled 
up into a single entry. This is often convenient, but it can drive those 
of us who want to see all messages one at a time nuts. (It’s not done 
as aggressively as in Gmail, thank goodness.) Also, after you expand 
an exchange of messages, there’s no control in the Inbox to contract it 
again. (Refreshing the browser window will do it, though.)
	
✓	Voicemail message transcript: Google’s sometimes-amusing, but 
generally-useful transcript is shown below the message audio bar. 
Google puts extra computational resources into getting phone numbers 
and other digits correct. Google provides buttons for you to vote on 
whether the transcript is useful, although the light green Yes button is 
much more inviting than the grayed out No button.

180
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
✓	Call link: Click to call the person from your Google Voice number. Google 
lets you select which of your phones to ring. This handy feature not 
only lets you use Google’s low international calling rates, it also lets you 
send a phone call to a landline phone and avoid using up cell plan minutes.
	
✓	SMS link: Click to reply with a free SMS text message, which can appear 
to come from your Google Voice number.
	
✓	Mark as read link: Unread messages give you a Mark as read link to 
click when you’ve read (and perhaps dealt with) a message. Consider 
archiving it at this time, as described in the next section.
	
✓	More drop-down menu — Mark as Unread: If you choose to mark the 
call as unread, the caller’s phone number appears in bold and the blue 
surround around the content is subtly darkened.
	
✓	More drop-down menu — Add note: Adding a note is great for clarify­
ing what’s going on in an exchange or tagging the notification for later 
searches. For example, if Google’s voice message transcription has 
misspelled a name, you can put the correct spelling here.
	
✓	More drop-down menu — Block caller: Great for getting rid of people 
who are bothering you, but don’t be too hasty. Not only can this be a 
harsh step; it’s easy to forget you’ve blocked someone. So your intent to 
temporarily block someone can accidentally become permanent.
The missing link
Google Voice is useful because it makes phone 
calls more like e-mail. But the best way to make 
voice interactions more like e-mail is to move 
them all the way into e-mail.
Google Voice notifications give you a Call 
link and an SMS link for replying to callers, 
but there’s another link that should be there: 
an E-mail link. E-mail is often the best way to 
respond to voice.
Why? E-mailing moves messages from real-
time interruptions to messages you can deal 
with asynchronously, at a more convenient 
time for you. E-mails can more easily be saved, 
tracked, searched, copied, and forwarded.
The E-mail link may be missing, but e-mail 
is never far away. Just click the name of the 
caller, and her contact information appears. 
Click on her e-mail address and you’re off and 
running. You can copy other people to update 
them, or even forward the message to someone 
who can handle it better.
It’s probably best to acknowledge the trans­
fer from phone to e-mail in your message; you 
can begin the e-mail message, “In response 
to your phone call. . .”, then respond. If you’re 
still the appropriate contact, don’t be afraid to 
ask, politely, that they e-mail rather than call. 
Appropriate language for this purpose may be 
some version of the following: “Please reply by 
e-mail rather than by phone, as I’ll find it easier 
to deal with your request quickly and effec­
tively.” The purpose is not to “diss” the caller 
but to help them; if they continue to contact you 
by phone, continue to respond in whichever 
way is most effective for both parties.

 Chapter 9: Using the Inbox and Handling Calls
	
You can do a lot with notes by treating the words in them as tags for later scan­
ning and searching. We recommend that you apply some simple rules. For 
example, tag every recording with a mnemonic such as “recording”; tag every 
conference call. That way you can quickly find all your recordings and confer­
ence calls. This is also a good place to make a note if you followed up by e-mail.
Because Google Voice is so new, exactly how people will use the service is 
unclear. Gmail is a pretty good analogy, though, and what happens in Gmail 
is that people keep years’ worth of e-mail messages, totaling in some cases 
several gigabytes, as a huge searchable archive of their online activities.
Experienced Gmail users are pretty confident that they can find a given e-mail 
about a business deal, a home purchase, and so on. People don’t seem to edit 
their inboxes down much, but some of the successful ones do tag e-mails, as 
we’re suggesting you do for Google Voice.
Performing multiple-item actions
You can perform certain actions on multiple notifications at a time. Each noti­
fication has a checkbox; click to select, or use the Select pull-down, combined 
with the page right and page left buttons to select many messages at once. 
Select as many messages as you want. Then choose an action, as shown in 
Figure 9-2.
	
✓	Select pull-down: This pull-down allows you to select or deselect mes­
sages by choosing all (select all), none (deselect all), read (select all 
read, deselect unread) or unread (select all unread, deselect read).
	
Use this in combination with the page-left and page-right buttons on the right 
edge of the Inbox, at the same level, to quickly act on messages in a crowded 
inbox or other folder.
	
✓	Archive: Archive takes an item out of the Inbox, but keeps it available in 
the History list. This is just like the All Mail/Inbox buckets in Gmail.
	
✓	Report Spam: Google Voice may inspire whole new types of phone spam, 
inspired by (and perhaps carried out by) e-mail spammers. Here’s our 
chance to fight back; every time you report spam you help fellow users as 
well as yourself.
	
Figure 9-2: 
You can act 
on several 
notifications 
at once.

Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
You can add your Google Voice number to the “do not call” list for spammers 
at www.donotcall.gov. Then, if you do get spam calls, report them; the 
holder of the number may get a big fine.
	
✓	Delete: You can delete messages, but in most cases it’s preferable to 
archive them. You never know when you might want to reply to just 
about any message that isn’t spam. Google Voice deletes the message 
without asking you to confirm.
	
✓	Starred folder only — Move to Inbox: In the Starred folder, a Move to 
Inbox folder allows you to quickly move a message to the Inbox.
	
Why might you need to move a starred message to the Inbox? Because you 
can delete a starred message; it’s removed from the Inbox and History, but 
remains in the Starred folder.
	
✓	More actions — Mark as read: This feature gives you a quick way to 
mark several messages as read but not much quicker than clicking the 
Mark as read link on each.
	
✓	More actions — Mark as unread: The Mark as unread link is somewhat 
hidden in messages, so it might be quicker to perform this operation by 
using the checkbox method than one at a time for individual messages.
	
✓	More actions — Add star: You can quickly star multiple messages.
	
✓	Show: All: This is the default setting, showing every message in your 
Inbox.
	
✓	Show: Unread: Showing only unread messages is good for focus, but it’s 
easy to leave the display in this mode and then wonder why the read 
messages in your Inbox aren’t showing up.
	
	Use Show: Unread with caution, and try to remember to return to Show: 
All as soon as you’re done. Otherwise, messages that are in your Inbox 
but read might seem to disappear.
	
✓	Page-right, page-right-end, page-left and page-left end. You can quickly 
scroll through pages of your Inbox here.
	
These controls at the top of the page are easily used in combination with the 
Select pull-down and checking or unchecking individual messages to rapidly 
choose groups of messages for actions.
Searching messages
The Search box is a small part of the Google Voice Inbox, but it’s given pride 
of place at the top and rightly so.

183
 Chapter 9: Using the Inbox and Handling Calls
Searching your calls is one of the new functions of Google Voice that you 
could never do before. Try it a few times; it has a pretty strong “wow!” factor. 
After you try it, use these tips to understand searching better and make your 
searches more effective:
	
✓	Search by text. You can search by text in a text message or voicemail 
transcription or Note. However, if Google has misspelled the text, the 
accuracy of your search will obviously suffer.
	
Correct misspelling of key terms in a voicemail transcription for search by 
entering the correct spelling of the term as a Note to that message. Also enter 
key terms for recorded calls as Notes so they can be searched for as well.
	
✓	No From or To Search: Google Mail has special search categories such 
as the person who sent you mail, or who you mailed to. Google Voice 
doesn’t have these special categories.
You can search by the name of the person who called you. You can get the calls 
from that person, but also the calls to that person, as well as calls in which 
that name is mentioned in the voicemail transcript, in an SMS text message, 
or in the Note you add to a call. Still useful, but this can be frustrating if 
you’re a florist with two different friends named Bud and three named Rose!
	
✓	Search by number: You can search by part or all of a person’s phone 
number. However, the search text has to be formatted exactly as 
the number is displayed in the notification in the Inbox.
	
✓	Search by name: You can search by a person’s name as a text string.
	
✓	Search by date: You can’t search by date.
Don’t get us wrong; being able to search your phone traffic is amazing. 
However, it’s still quite limited, not yet nearly as effective as using search 
with, say, Gmail.
Using your browser for the right answer
You can use your browser to create an e-mailed 
response to a caller by using your default e-mail 
client, if that’s not Gmail.
Create a bookmark in your favorite browser with 
the following, instead of a Web page address:
mailto:subject=Re: your voicemail
This code opens a message from your default 
e-mail client, with the subject line filled in as 
“Re: your voicemail.” Just drag and drop the 
person’s e-mail address into the To: line, add 
the e-mail addresses of any people you want to 
copy, and you’re off and running.

184
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
The best hope for searching effectively in Google Voice is “hard” information: 
the person’s name, (parts of) their phone number, and text you enter in Notes 
with the notification.
Using folders
Google Voice offers 11 folders for your phone traffic through Google Voice. 
Five are storage for managing your Inbox messages; six are different views on 
your calls.
The five folders for managing your Inbox messages are:
	
✓	Inbox: Holds all incoming messages except the ones you archive or 
delete. The name Inbox is displayed in bold when there are one or more 
unread messages, and the number of unread messages is displayed next 
to Inbox. This is the only one of the top five folders for which unread 
messages are highlighted.
	
Only the Placed and Received folders show the length of a call.
	
✓	Starred: Adds the Move to Inbox top-level button to those described in 
the previous section. All messages you star are kept in the Starred folder, 
even if you archive or delete them. If you unstar a deleted message, it 
disappears from the Starred folder and exists only in the Trash.
	
✓	History: Also has the Move to Inbox top-level button. History holds all 
messages that aren’t deleted. When you archive a message it removes 
it from the Inbox but leaves the existing copy in the History folder. You 
can archive a message while looking at it in the History folder, which 
removes it from the Inbox.
	
✓	Spam: Has different top-level buttons, Delete Forever (see next bullet) 
and Not Spam. This folder holds messages that are suspected by Google 
Voice of being spam, including incoming messages that go straight to 
the Spam folder and messages that come to the Inbox but that you mark 
as spam. Using the Not Spam button moves selected messages to the 
Inbox and History folders.
	
✓	Trash: Holds deleted messages only. Extra buttons for managing 
selected messages are Delete Forever and Undelete (which works 
the same as Not Spam in the previous bullet). When you click Delete 
Forever, you receive a dialog asking “Are you sure?” If you click Yes, the 
selected messages are removed from your system, even if starred.
The six folders that provide different views on your messages are views on all 
the messages in your History folder; they don’t reflect what is or isn’t in your 
Inbox. They also don’t include messages in the Trash or Spam folders. Each 
of these six folders is highlighted if it contains unread messages.

185
 Chapter 9: Using the Inbox and Handling Calls
Unlike the set of five folders I previously detailed — Inbox, Starred, History, 
Spam and Trash — that means you can have unread messages in several 
different folders. You can have more unread messages in these folders than 
show up in your Inbox if you move unread messages out of your Inbox into, 
say, History.
The six folders names are largely self-explanatory:
	
✓	Voicemail: These are calls you received through Google Voice, did not 
answer, and received a voicemail for. Includes all your transcripts.
	
✓	SMS: Includes all your SMS text message notifications.
	
✓	Recorded: Includes all calls you recorded even a brief part of. This 
folder contains a subset of the calls in Received.
	
✓	Placed: Includes all calls you made out through Google Voice. This 
folder and Received also show the length of the call.
	
✓	Received: All calls you received through Google Voice and answered. 
This folder and Placed also show the length of the call.
	
✓	Missed: All calls you received through Google Voice and neither 
answered nor received a voicemail message.
Optimizing your Inbox
You can use your whole Inbox (in the overall sense, including all the folders) to 
manage, archive, and retrieve all your voice traffic that goes through Google 
Voice. Here are a few tips you can use to get the most out of it:
	
✓	Add callers to your Contacts. When calls come in from numbers not 
in your Contacts list, use the Add link on the notification to add the 
number to an existing contact if you have one, or create the needed new 
contact if you don’t. Doing this regularly makes both Google Voice and 
Gmail steadily more useful.
	
✓	Move all your phone traffic to Google Voice. Put it all through Google 
Voice. The more your calls go through Google Voice, the more it can 
help you. See Chapter 6 for details.
	
Stop answering your other phone numbers and leave voicemail greetings on 
them telling people to call your Google Voice number.
	
✓	Move Google Voice traffic to e-mail. Many calls to you can be replied to 
— or delegated to someone else — through e-mail. E-mail is easier to 
track, search, copy people on, and manage than voicemail, even with 
Google Voice to help you. This also saves time, interruptions, and money.

186
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
✓	Don’t move e-mail traffic to Google Voice. Some Google Voice users 
give out their Google Voice number more freely than they previously 
gave out their phone number because, hey, Google Voice generates 
e-mail notifications, too. Don’t do this, because it just adds a layer to 
what may well become an e-mail conversation anyway and generates 
more phone calls for you to decide what to do with. Keep using your 
e-mail address as your first line of defense against intrusion.
	
✓	Manage the Inbox folder. Use the Inbox folder specifically as a control 
panel for active voice traffic, with the star to designate the really urgent 
ones. Deal with messages quickly and archive them.
	
✓	Tag messages. Use the Notes field to tag notifications, including notifica­
tions of calls you placed. Doing this makes your overall Inbox far more 
valuable. If you’re a consultant or someone who otherwise bills for your 
time, this capability can help with invoicing. (Remember, everything you 
don’t explicitly delete is in the History folder.)
Handling Calls with Google Voice
Google Voice has so many features that you may have trouble remembering 
which one is best for the situation you’re in. Here are some calling scenarios 
you might encounter, and how to best use GV in each.
Options for all incoming calls
You have certain options in Google Voice only for incoming calls. The two 
key such options are recording calls and starting conference calls.
Recording calls
Recording an incoming call in Google Voice is easy. Just press 4 at any point 
during the call. The caller receives a warning message that the call will be 
recorded.
After the call, you receive a notification with a link to the recording, as shown 
in Figure 9-3.
	
Google Voice does not send you a file with a recording of the call as, say, an 
MP3. It sends you a link to such a file. However, it allows you to download the 
recording to an MP3 file. You can copy this file to an MP3 player, such as an 
iPod — or, these days, an awful lot of mobile phones — edit it in sound editing 
software and so on.

187
 Chapter 9: Using the Inbox and Handling Calls
	
Figure 9-3: 
Make a 
record of 
any 
incoming 
call.
	
	
Mac computers come with programs for editing audio. You can easily find 
freeware, shareware, and paid programs for Windows. One good source for 
such programs is download.com.
Google Voice also allows you to embed the link in a Web page so the conver­
sation can be shared widely without the necessity of hosting or otherwise 
moving the file around.
	
The etiquette and legalities of publicizing Google Voice recordings have not 
been threshed out thoroughly yet. We recommend that you get permission 
from the participants before sharing a call recording online. Give the par­
ticipants an opportunity to review the version that you intend to publicize, 
including any edits you make. If possible, provide a transcript as well.
Conference calls
Google Voice makes conference calls easy — again, for incoming calls only. 
If you don’t have a smartphone, such as the iPhone, that can merge calls, 
have people call you so that you can initiate the conference. Google Voice 
announces the caller on call waiting:
“Call from: Jane.”

188
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
(The words “Call from” are spoken by Google Voice. The caller’s name is 
read out by Google Voice if the phone number used is in your Contacts; it 
is spoken in the person’s own name if call screening is on and the phone 
number used is not in your Contacts.)
“To add this caller to your current call, press 5.”
Just press 5; it’s as easy as that. You can have up to three incoming calls on 
the line, for a total of four people on the call.
You can also use Google Voice’s recording capability by pressing 4 at any 
point during an incoming call.
	
We suggest that you make a habit of recording conference calls. This step is 
good for alleviating confusion about who said what, providing support for any 
agreements reached, and sharing the call with people who missed the meeting.
If you want to add more than three participants to a call, use a smartphone 
to handle the call. Add the maximum with Google Voice, then have the rest 
call your true cell phone number and conference them in this way. Try this 
before you depend on it for an important call.
	
Google Voice conference calls offer tremendous money and time savings com­
pared to most other ways of having conference calls. Many providers make a 
great deal of money charging organizations in particular for overpriced confer­
ence calling capabilities that are limited, hard to use, require advance notifica­
tion, get oversubscribed and therefore are unavailable when you need them 
most, and so on.
Google Voice saves you most of this trouble. Existing services will not go out 
of business entirely. Google Voice is limited to just 4 lines at once and lacks 
some of the scheduling and media sharing capabilities of other services. But 
for small and casual conference calls, and with its built-in recording capabil­
ity, Google Voice can’t be beat.
	
Have the conference call on a comfortable phone with good reception or a 
good connection and good voice quality. Avoid conference calls on the move 
if at all possible; you’ll just frustrate yourself and others.
Emergency phone registration
The normal process of registering a phone for use with Google Voice, as 
described in Chapter 3, is sensible but cumbersome. You specify a phone 
number; Google Voice makes sure that the phone isn’t registered to anyone 
else for use with Google Voice and then calls you on that phone. You enter a 
code that Google Voice displays onscreen, and the phone is then available for 
you to manage within your Google Voice account.

189
 Chapter 9: Using the Inbox and Handling Calls
But what if you’re visiting an office somewhere or a friend’s house, or stay­
ing in a hotel? What if your cell phone is out of range of a signal or out of 
charge, but your friend’s or colleague’s isn’t? You may want all your Google 
Voice calls to go to one number — either so you get them, or so they can be 
answered for you.
Google Voice offers a quick and easy way to do this, and there’s no need to 
even register the phone you’re using. This feature, called temporary call for­
warding, forwards all your Google Voice calls to the temporary number.
The steps for setting or clearing temporary call forwarding from the Google 
Voice touchtone menu are very similar, so they’re given one after another 
here.
Setting temporary call forwarding
You can’t set up temporary call forwarding from the Web interface; you have 
to call your Google Voice number and use Google’s touchtone menus.
	
You can’t use a phone registered to your Google Voice account for temporary 
call forwarding.
Follow these steps to set temporary call forwarding:
	
1.	Choose which phone to call from.
	
	 If you call from the number that you want the calls to be forwarded to, 
you won’t have to enter the number you’re calling from. But if you do 
this, the phone may incur long distance charges for the (brief) call. To 
avoid this, calling from your cell phone is likely to be quickest and to 
avoid long distance charges.
	
2.	Call your Google Voice number. If necessary to access your account, 
press * and enter your PIN.
	
	 If you’re calling from one of your registered phones that connects 
directly to your Google Voice account (usually, this is your cell phone), 
Google Voice will offer you options; if not, you’ll need to press * and 
enter your PIN to access your account and hear options.
 
• Press 4 to access the main settings menu.
 
• Press 4 again to access temporary settings.
 
• Press 2 to set a temporary forwarding number.
	
	You can use the number you’re calling from or enter a different 
number.
	
3.	Specify whether to use the number you’re calling from, or enter the 
other number you wish to use.

190
Part II: Maximizing Your Voice 
	
When you receive a call to your Google Voice number, your temporary phone 
number rings in addition to your other phones — depending on their settings. 
You have to turn off ringing for these other phones in Google Voice if you 
don’t want them to ring while your temporary phone number is in effect.
Clearing temporary call forwarding
You can clear temporary call forwarding from a phone, by using Google’s 
touchtone menus, or from the Google Voice Web site.
Follow these steps to clear temporary call forwarding using Google’s touch-
tone menus:
	
1.	Call your Google Voice number. If necessary to access your account, 
press * and enter your PIN.
	
2.	Press 4 to access the main settings menu. Choose from the following:
 
• Press 4 again to access temporary settings.
 
• Press 2 to edit or remove your temporary forwarding number.
 
• Press 3 to turn off your temporary forwarding number.
Follow these steps to clear temporary call forwarding using the Google Voice 
Web site:
	
1.	Go to the Google Voice Web site at voice.google.com. Sign in if 
needed.
	
	 The Google Voice Web site appears.
	
2.	Click the Settings link in the upper part of your screen to go to the 
Settings area.
	
3.	Click the Phones tab.
	
	 A list of your phones appears, showing your temporary number at the 
top, as shown in Figure 9-4.
	
4.	Click Delete to remove the temporary number.
	
Figure 9-4: 
Your 
temporary 
number

right at 
the top.

Using keyboard commands
Google offers keyboard commands in many of its programs. Google Voice 
is particularly well-suited to them because of the repetitive nature of much 
work with phone calls.
Table 9-1 sums up keyboard commands for Google Voice. If you handle a lot 
of calls, it may well be worth the effort to learn them.

Google Voice for the deaf
Phones are a hugely important tool for most 
people and are a big source of frustration for 
people who are hard of hearing or deaf. While 
most states have regulations supporting phone 
accessibility for the deaf, still more could be 
done.
E-mail and text messaging, on the other hand, 
have been hugely helpful to deaf people, and 
Google Voice is another step in this direction. 
It allows interactions that begin in voice to be 
continued in text, which is perfect for anyone 
who needs or prefers text.
E-mailed notifications of voice messages are 
great as an alert, and transcriptions of voice 
messages, while far from perfect, can still be 
helpful.
Google Voice is additionally useful for those 
who are hard of hearing, rather than more fully 
deaf, as Google Voice makes it easy to play 
back a voicemail message repeatedly, through 
headphones and/or at high volume, to help the 
recipient parse the contents.

oogle Voice is ideal for people who juggle a cell 
phone or two and one or more landlines. There’s 
a special Google Voice Mobile Web site that anyone 
can access and specific Google Voice dialers for your 
smartphone. We show you how to make the most of 
the rich range of offerings out there.

G
oogle Voice is made to work across all your phones; however, you can 
also use it as a power boost for your cell phone.
Many people use their cell phones to handle calls and, by doing so, get the 
convenience of a single interface and suffer through the hassle of mixing 
between friends and family, personal business, and work through a single 
device, often at all times of day. Much of the power of Google Voice is in help­
ing you untangle the spaghetti and get only the calls you want and only when 
you want them.
But this means that the make-or-break factor for changing over to a Google 
Voice number is having all calls and texts from your cell phone appear to 
be from your Google Voice number, making your communications easier to 
manage consistently.
To make all that easier, there are two solutions for cell phones: the Google 
Voice mobile Web site is one, and dialer apps for BlackBerry and Android 
phones is the other. A dialer is a smartphone application that lets you use 
your phone just like you’d use the Web interface of Google Voice.
The iPhone once had several dialers of its own, as we describe in Chapter 11, 
and a fourth was expected directly from Google. However, in a move that got 

196
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
a lot of attention in mid-2009, Apple rejected the Google Voice application 
from Google itself and, perhaps more shocking, yanked the existing Google 
Voice apps from the App Store.
So users of the GV mobile site will include iPhone users, some of whom will 
be quite unhappy at having the dialer apps pulled, along with users of other 
phones that don’t have dialer support.
In addition to supporting dialing and texting, the Google Voice mobile Web 
site and dialers have another purpose as well: to allow you to manage Google 
Voice from your phone instead of from a computer.
Of course, the original purpose of GrandCentral (and now, Google Voice) was 
to control all your phones by using your computer. But with the advent of 
the BlackBerry, the most important computer for many people became the 
one in their pocket, not on their desktop.
A cell phone-centric approach spread to, and even intensified with the arrival 
of the iPhone. But because not everyone has a smartphone, Google gives you 
the option of controlling Google Voice from your desktop, your smartphone, 
or both.
Benefitting from Google Voice
The Google Voice mobile Web site, which we refer to here as the GV mobile 
site, is surprisingly capable, but it’s still a compromise. It’s not as good for 
making calls as using a dialer and it’s not as good for managing Google Voice 
as using the full Google Voice Web site. For a report describing the tradeoffs, 
see www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/04/12/gvdialer-puts-google-
voice-on-your-mobile-handset/.)
The GV Mobile site serves two purposes:
	
✓	As a dialer: The GV mobile site is your best choice for a dialer on 
most phones out there today, as shown in Figure 10-1. On Android and 
BlackBerry, you should use Google’s customized dialer for your phone 
or, if you prefer, a third-party dialer. On iPhone, you can use one of two 
third-party dialers, but only if you got your copy before they were pulled 
from the App Store in mid-2009. These dialers are much better inte­
grated in terms of their user interface appearance and their integration 
into the phone’s native functionality and in some cases can work just as 
well as dialing a normal call.

197
 Chapter 10: Using the Google Voice Mobile Web Site
	
	If you’re paying high charges for data transmission on your non-smartphone, 
using the Google Voice Mobile Web site may be expensive. If so, con­
sider dialing out to your Google Voice number and making calls from 
there instead.
	
✓	For managing Google Voice: You can accomplish many tasks in man­
aging Google Voice through the GV mobile site. On smartphones with 
dialers, you can manage Google Voice through the dialer instead; for 
smartphones without them you may use the more capable Google Voice 
Web site some of the time and the faster GV mobile site at other times.
If you use an Android phone or a BlackBerry, or if you have an iPhone and 
got a dialer app before they were pulled, go to the specific chapter for your 
phone. (Unless you have a dumbphone, too, or are a manager, a software 
developer, or just want to know what people with lesser phones will have to 
suffer through.) See Chapter 11 for information on how to use a Google Voice 
dialer on iPhone, Chapter 12 for BlackBerry information, and Chapter 13 for 
Android details.
	
Figure 10-1: 
Using the 
GV mobile 
site as a 
dialer.
	
	
To use the GV mobile site as a dialer, it has to know which number to dial to 
reach you. The site doesn’t “know” what the number is of the cell phone it’s 
being used on. Use the My Mobile Number setting of Google Voice Mobile, 
under the Settings tab, to specify which phone you’re running the GV mobile 
site on.

198
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
Finding Out What the GV 
Mobile Site Can Do
The GV mobile site is nothing except a stripped down version of the Google 
Voice site that is optimized for smaller screens. Although the GV mobile site 
does less than the full site, it’s more compact and focused only on key tasks. 
Therefore, it’s much easier to use from the small screen and the poor-to-
awful keyboard and positioning controls of a mobile phone.
Here’s what the GV mobile site can do:
	
✓	Dial! Dial all your outbound calls by calling your Google Voice number 
first, through the GV mobile site or the full Google Voice site. That way, 
the people you call will see your calls originating from your Google

What makes a smartphone?
Smartphones are all the rage, but the very defi­
nition of one is somewhat up in the air.
Most people understand a smartphone to be a 
phone that has a platform: a well-defined oper­
ating system that outsiders can program to; 
hardware that enables at least some PC-type 
capabilities; and strong functionality as a 
phone. Also, for most people to consider it, it 
has to look like a winner in terms of sales and 
application support.
Capabilities that people buy smartphones for 
include on-the-go e-mail and Web surfing. 
The hardware and software that support these 
capabilities include a full keyboard — on a 
touch screen, with real buttons, or both — and 
a screen large and high-resolution enough to 
allow at least limited Web surfing.
By these measures the clear winners among 
smartphones are the phones we cover in the 
following chapters: the iPhone, BlackBerry 
phones, and all the Android-based phones 
we’ve seen so far. (With the latter two types 
advantaged by still having dialers available.)
Palm Pre is capable enough to qualify as a 
smartphone, but it’s quite new, so it’s still up in 
the air as to whether it will become a winner. 
Windows Mobile phones are smartphones but 
seem to be fading in sales after some strong 
early starts.
If the leaders in smartphones remain iPhone, 
BlackBerry, and Android, what are their spe­
cialties? The iPhone is best for Web surfing; 
BlackBerry phones are beloved for e-mail. 
Perhaps top-notch Google Voice integration 
will become the distinguishing feature for 
Android phones.

✓	See and use your Inbox. The GV mobile site, shown in Figure 10-2, 
shows your Inbox right up front, with recognizable (but less functional) 
versions of your call notifications in it. Voicemail transcripts are the 
same ones you see in the full Google Voice Web site.
	
✓	Turn Do Not Disturb on and off. You can control this crucial global set­
ting from GV Mobile.
	
✓	Use your Contacts. See a list of your Google Voice Contacts (only the 
full list, unfortunately, not smaller lists like Friends or Family), search 
the list, and then call or SMS them. Again, the call or SMS text message 
appears to come from your Google Voice number.
	
✓	Change global and top-level settings. You can change many general set­
tings and global phone, call presentation and call screening settings. See 
Figure 10-3.
	
✓	Add credit for calls. Crucially, you can add to your credits for interna­
tional calls from GV Mobile. Otherwise, you could easily run out of credit 
to use for international calls and be out of luck until you could get to a 
computer and add more credit.

You can only play back calls in your Google Voice Inbox on your phone if it 
can play MP3 files. You may well not know if your phone can play back MP3 
files until you try playing back a call from your Google Voice Inbox, so if you’re 
not sure, try it right away so you know.

200
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
If your phone can’t play back MP3 files, you can’t use the Play link in incom­
ing messages to play them back. You can still see that calls have come in and 
read the transcripts of voicemails that Google provides. You can also still use 
the other functions of the GV mobile site.

Too many contacts?
One of the difficulties of having multiple-device 
access to shared resources such as the Web is 
that things that make sense on one system don’t 
work the same way on another.
Having a long list of contacts in Google Voice 
works well on a computer where you can 
quickly move through them or use various fold­
ers with shorter lists. From the GV Mobile site, 
you’d be better off with a hotlist of frequently 
called numbers. But that doesn’t exist, unfor­
tunately; you have to search to cut down the 
size of the list, which can be painstaking. The 
smaller the phone, in general, the harder it is.
If you have HTML skills, or even a word pro­
cessor that can save a Web page, you can 
create an HTML document with hyperlinks to 
your top contacts. You can then publish it, for 
example, on a blogging site or another site you 
control, then use it for quick access to your top 
contacts. Not quite as convenient as using the 
hotkeys on your cell phone keypad, but better 
than nothing.

Understanding What the 
GV Mobile Site Can’t Do
Google Voice has so many capabilities that it can be tough to remember and 
manage them all, especially under the pressure of a ringing phone. Trying 
to remember what the GV mobile site can and can’t do is enough to bring 
tears to one’s eyes. (Or maybe we’ve just been spending too much time with 
Google Voice and are becoming a bit fragile.)
Never fear, For Dummies is here! We’ve created a handy table listing the 
major features of Google Voice major features from the Google Voice Web 
site that are available on GV Mobile. The table can help you decide when to 
use GV Mobile, when to use the full Google Voice site, when to use a phone 
directly, and when to stop and take a rest.

Working with Limitations 
of the GV Mobile Site
The GV mobile site does a lot less than the full site. This isn’t to knock it; it’s 
a specialized tool built for minimalism. If you want to master Google Voice, 

203
 Chapter 10: Using the Google Voice Mobile Web Site
though, you need to have a handle of what is only available on the full site. 
Things that you can’t do on GV Mobile:
	
✓	Flexible replies: The full site supports flexible replies to either a call or 
an SMS by calling back, sending an SMS reply, or replying by e-mail. The 
GV mobile site only supports calling back a caller or sending SMS replies 
to SMS messages.
	
✓	Contacts management: The GV mobile site doesn’t allow you to easily add 
a caller as a contact. Nor does it allow you to edit contact information.
	
✓	Call control by group or by contact: In the GV mobile site, you can only 
change global settings for which phones to ring, which voicemail greet­
ings to play, and call presentation; you can’t fine-tune settings at the 
group or contact level. Since group and individual settings often over­
ride global settings, this can cause difficulties.
	
✓	Group access: You can only scroll through or search your All Contacts 
group; other groups, including your own custom groups, are inaccessible.
	
✓	Call widgets: You can’t do anything with call widgets on GV Mobile.
	
✓	Miscellaneous settings: On the GV mobile site you can’t change lan­
guage or the timezone you’re operating in.
The GV mobile site also lacks some features compared to the custom dialers 
for Android, BlackBerry, and iPhone, including:
	
✓	Dialer interface: You enter phone numbers for calls and SMS into a 
small strip using your phone’s keypad; there’s no onscreen dialing inter­
face to make it easier to see what you’re doing, and no interaction with 
any touchscreen support your phone might have.
	
✓	Look and feel: The GV mobile site is a generic mobile Web site, lacking 
the same look and feel as applications native to a given phone.
	
✓	Speed: An application runs faster because it’s all native to the phone. A 
Web site has inherent delays in sending information back and forth to 
and from the Internet.
	
✓	Integration: The GV mobile site knows nothing about contacts, call 
logs, quick dialing keys and so on that you might have on your phone; 
you’re working in two different worlds on the GV mobile site versus the 
phone’s built-in capabilities.
Using GV Mobile
Using the GV mobile site is fairly easy at first, and becomes even easier with 
practice. There’s a big caveat to this, though. On most phones except the 

204
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
very best smartphones, doing anything on the Web is difficult. Here are some 
of the barriers you face:
	
✓	Small screens: The iPhone has a full 6 square inches of screen space; 
Android, Windows Mobile, and some BlackBerry screens are almost as 
big. Other phones tend to have much smaller screens, making it very 
hard to use even a specially designed mobile site on very small screens.
	
✓	Difficult text entry: BlackBerry smartphones with full keyboards are 
famous for relatively easy text entry; other smartphones tend to have 
full keyboards of some type, either onscreen or with keys. Where text 
entry falls well below the BlackBerry standard, texting or e-mailing from 
the phone gets harder. Where there’s number-pad entry instead of a full 
keyboard, entering text is slow and error-prone for most.
	
	Difficult cursor control: Moving smoothly around any Web page is very 
important, and only a few phones have controls that really make it easy. 
(BlackBerrys such as the Bold and the iPhone with its touch screen are 
two of the best.)
	
✓	Slow response time: Web access time is much slower on a mobile phone 
than on a computer with wireless access.
The better the Web support on your phone, the easier the GV mobile site will 
be to use. Only on a few phones with really good Web support is it practical 
to consider using the full Google Voice Web site from the phone, and most of 
those phones have custom dialer apps as described in the next few chapters. 
You only need to consider using the full site when you need to do something 
the dialer can’t do.
Given that each step in using the GV mobile site is difficult, you want to make 
the most of each step you take. Part of doing that successfully is knowing 
what you can and can’t do in GV Mobile, as described in the previous section. 
Another part of it is going straight to the function you need.
Here’s a menu tree for the GV mobile site to help you get straight to what you 
want:
	
✓	Every page: On every page of the GV mobile site you can find a strip 
across the top with links: Inbox, Contacts, Search and Settings. At 
the bottom of every page, you find Quick Call / SMS and links to 
Notifications folders: Voicemail, SMS, Placed, Received, and Missed. You 
can also find links Sign out, Help & Terms, and More Google Products.
	
✓	Inbox: Call and SMS notifications with SMS text contents and voicemail 
transcriptions.
	
✓	Contacts: Your contacts are shown; first is a contact-specific search box, 
and then a list with 40 contacts per page. See Figure 10-4.

205
 Chapter 10: Using the Google Voice Mobile Web Site
	
✓	Search: The Search tab at the top level searches your Inbox, not your 
Contacts.
	
✓	Settings: Five links are under the Settings tab, as shown in Figure 10-5: 
 
• Settings-General: Change Voicemail Notifications, Call Screening, 
Default Voicemail Greeting, Call Presentation and Caller ID display.
 
• Settings-Phones: Change default Forwarding Settings for your 
Google Voice number to the phones you’ve registered with Google 
Voice.
 
• Settings-Add Credit: Current Balance shows, and there’s an Add 
Credit button.
 
• Settings-Do Not Disturb: Enable/disable Do Not Disturb.
 
• Settings-My Mobile Number: Specify which phone you’re using 
as your mobile phone. This is important; it’s the phone that rings 
when you place a call using the mobile Web site, so it needs to be 
the number of the handset you’re running Google Voice on.
	
✓	Quick Call | SMS: At the bottom of every page.
	
✓	Notifications folder link: Voicemail; SMS; Placed; Received; Missed. At 
the bottom of every page.
	
✓	Links: Sign out, Help & Terms, More Google Products. At the bottom of 
every page.

Use this information to help you find the function you need quickly.
The stripped-down functionality of the GV mobile site also might make you 
think twice about a few other aspects of how you use Google Voice overall, 
especially if you find yourself managing Google Voice from the GV mobile site 
a lot.
One key element is Contacts. A pared-down All Contacts list — shorter than, 
say, 40 contacts — will be much easier to navigate in GV Mobile, even though 
you might like having it larger when you use the full Google Voice Web site. A 
tough call! (No pun intended.)
The other element is your customization strategy. As we describe in 
Chapter 6, you can set up your Groups and individual Contacts so they have 
their own settings for which phones to ring, which voicemail greeting to use 
and whether to use call presentation. You can also, though, set them to use 
the Group setting. Because the Group setting is the only level you can change 
from GV Mobile, you may want to set up your Groups and Contacts to always 
reflect the Group setting. Then you can quickly change the settings for every­
one while on the move.

Using Google Voice with
 the iPhone
In This Chapter
▶	Finding out if the iPhone is a good fit for Google Voice?
▶	Examining dialers for the iPhone
▶	Asking whether the iPhone is the best choice
T
he iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the world, with about 40 
million sold as of mid-2009 and rising fast. Like the iPod for music play­
ers, it usually has the biggest “wow!” factor among mobile phones. And even 
if your friends have seen their share of iPhones, you can probably still wow 
them with something cool from the App Store.
However, for Google Voice users, the App store got a little less cool in mid-
2009, a few months after Google Voice was announced. Apple turned down 
the official Google dialer that Google had created and pulled the three existing 
Google Voice apps from third parties, VoiceCentral, GVdialer, and GV Mobile.
The iPhone is also the leading phone for accessing the Web, with more than half 
of all mobile Web traffic going through iPhones at this writing. (That’s about ten 
times more than the nearest rival.) Given that Google Voice brings so much power 
over one’s phones to the Web, the iPhone and Google Voice seem a natural fit.
Using Google Voice with an iPhone
The iPhone is an amazing piece of technology on its own, and also the center 
of an ecosystem of add-on devices and software applications that are making 
the iPhone itself more and more capable. For an iPhone user, Google Voice 
can be regarded as possibly the best of the many tools out there of which to 
advantage.
And iPhone users do indeed take advantage of it. No one is releasing any 
numbers at this writing, but anecdotally it seems that iPhone may have as 

208
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
strong a lead among Google Voice users as it does on the mobile Web. Web 
access, a crucial part of using Google Voice, is also perhaps the leading dis­
tinguishing feature of the iPhone, so Google Voice and the iPhone are a natu­
ral combination.
iPhone sales are closely rivaled by sales of RIM BlackBerry phones, but 
there’s a big difference in how they’re used. BlackBerry smartphones are 
first and foremost business phones, provided by companies to their employ­
ees for work purposes in handling both phone calls and e-mail. Many such 
phones are “locked down” by the carrier or the company to limit their 
functionality. However, the recently introduced BlackBerry Storm is a touch­
screen device that’s a full competitor to the iPhone.
The iPhone is a consumer phone first and foremost, though it’s gaining 
increasing traction in business. iPhones are used much more independently, 
accessorized and customized with applications by their users. Apple’s App 
Store for the iPhone far outpaces any similar offering or rivals.
More conceptually, iPhone users may be in the vanguard among people who 
do more and more of their computing, as well as a lot of their communicat­
ing, through their phones. BlackBerry was the first to stretch the definition 
of a phone by including robust e-mail capability. However, the iPhone goes it 
one better by providing a full-fledged Web browser and a wide range of appli­
cations through the App Store. Though still evolving, iPhone use is increas­
ingly taking over functions that used to be handled only on the computer.
The iPhone also pioneered one of the distinguishing features now found in 
Google Voice: visual voicemail, shown in Figure 11-1, which stacks up voice­
mail messages in a list and was a huge innovation when it appeared with the 
first iPhone. Instant access to only the message you want, played back with 
full control takes a good deal of the pain out of voicemail. Being able to for­
ward and merge calls is even cooler.
However, Google Voice outdoes this by not only listing messages separately, 
and giving you direct access to them, but by providing transcripts as well. 
Other Google Voice features, such as the ability to redirect calls to various 
phones, aren’t found on the iPhone or on any other phone, though some of 
them are matched by other (usually paid) services.
The fact that Google Voice is so popular among iPhone users is a bit odd. 
Google Voice is great for managing several phones, but our impression is that 
many iPhone users don’t use other phones much. They integrate nearly all 
their calling through their iPhones.
Google Voice is often seen, first and foremost, as a tool to manage multiple 
phones. It’s also great, though, for untangling the spaghetti of personal, personal 
business, and work calls all arriving at one destination, the iPhone, often all at 
the same time. Google Voice gives the user control they previously lacked.

209
 Chapter 11: Using Google Voice with the iPhone
The minutes problem and the iPhone
As we mention in Chapter 2, the downside to 
using Google Voice may be more important for 
some users. That’s the problem of not getting 
free minutes within a cell phone calling plan 
when you use Google Voice. For AT&T call­
ers, the plan option that enables this is called 
Mobile 2 Mobile.
AT&T has been the exclusive service provider 
for the iPhone in the U.S. since it was launched 
in 2007. Although these things can change, a 
major AT&T’s service “giveaway” has been 
free mobile-to-mobile calls among AT&T users 
nationwide. Not only do you (and the person 
you’re speaking to) not pay, as on any domestic 
phone call; you don’t use minutes on your cell 
phone calling plan.
Not only did this calling plan feature help close 
friends and family members who could luck 
out, or conspire to all be on AT&T to save min­
utes. The feature also contributed to a certain 
camaraderie among U.S. iPhone users who 
were all perforce AT&T customers as well. 
If you and your friend or family member both 
used iPhones, and had the option enabled, your 
mobile-to-mobile calls were completely free.
When you switch to using Google Voice on 
your iPhone, you and your AT&T-serviced call­
ing partners lose out. You’re placing calls to and 
from a non-AT&T number, your Google Voice 
number, not directly. Your calls now burn min­
utes for both parties. By getting in the middle, 
your Google Voice number has prevented you 
from getting the freebie.

Dialers for the iPhone
When Google Voice was first announced, the iPhone immediately got dialers 
that let users make calls and get voicemail with less hassle.
A dialer is a smartphone application that lets you use your phone just like 
you’d use the Web interface of Google Voice. Without a dialer, you have to 
call your Google Voice number, wait for a connection, press 2, then enter the 
number you’re calling.
Dialers take a big step out of the process. They allow you to enter the phone 
number you’re calling and then they dial Google Voice for you. You still have 
to wait for Google Voice to call you back before the call will connect, but you 
get the benefit of having outbound calls show as coming from your Google 
Voice number.
Texts work similarly. You have to go into the dialer application to send a text 
message to show the originating number as being from Google Voice. This 
is often less convenient than sending texts directly from the phone, but pre­
serves the Google Voice number as the sending and reply-to number.
In the first few months that Google Voice was available, the iPhone had the best 
dialers. They were fairly well-integrated with the iPhone, allowing you to use 
iPhone contacts (which can be synced with several different sources), and with 
the dialing screen, for example, looking just like the native one on the iPhone.
However, Google has now released new dialers for the BlackBerry and 
phones based on its own Android phone operating system, but not yet the 

211
 Chapter 11: Using Google Voice with the iPhone
iPhone. The BlackBerry dialer from Google is about as good as the best cur­
rent iPhone dialers. The Android dialer, however, takes a big step forward.
The reason is because it’s not really a separate dialer. Instead, it allows you 
to choose how to treat your Google Voice number. The most extreme — and, 
to many, the most appealing — choice is to use your Google Voice number 
for all your calls from the phone.
With this option selected, calling and texting from the phone’s native screens 
for these purposes sends out the calls and texts using Google Voice. There’s 
no calling back, unusual screens, or extra steps. The phone operates effec­
tively as a Google Voice handset.
This raises the stakes for the iPhone. The iPhone, of course, has been distrib­
uted by AT&T exclusively in the U.S. since its launch. That may mean that 
both Apple, as the iPhone’s manufacturer and AT&T, as its exclusive distribu­
tor and service provider in the U.S., have to agree and help in order to pro­
vide the same level of integration on the iPhone as on Android phones.
So it’s an open question just how integrated Google’s upcoming dialer for the 
iPhone will be. There’s then a follow-up open question as to whether other 
iPhone dialers can match whatever the Google dialer provides or will be, in 
some ways, restricted.
With this in mind we briefly describe the current state of dialers for the iPhone 
in the following section. Keep an eye on our blog, getgooglevoice.com, for 
updates as to anything that occurs after the publication date of this book.
Using a dialer versus using the Web
You certainly can use the GV Mobile site, as described in the previous chap­
ter, to make calls and send texts from your iPhone. You can even use the full 
Google Voice site, a more practical alternative on the iPhone than on any 
other major smartphone because of the iPhone’s great Web access.
Several problems occur when using either of the sites, though:
	
✓	The dialing interface from GV Mobile and the full Google Voice site is 
clumsy.
	
✓	The Inbox is not as nice as the iPhone’s visual voicemail.
	
✓	The sites are quite slow compared to the built-in iPhone apps for dialing 
and texting.

212
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
An iPhone dialer takes care of all of these problems. Expect your dialer to have:
	
✓	The ability to use a dialing interface, much like the iPhone’s, along with 
access to its contacts and so on.
	
✓	Flexible options as to whether outbound calls, text messages, and 
replies are shown as coming from the native phone number or your 
Google Voice number.
	
✓	An iPhone gloss on the interface to call history and the Inbox to make it 
iPhone-like.
	
✓	Speed; iPhone dialers are much faster than the GV Mobile site or the full 
Google Voice site.
The upshot is that almost anyone who uses Google Voice from an iPhone 
will use an app, even if it has a price attached to it. The advantages in speed, 
usability, and functionality are so great as to make it worthwhile.
However, because Apple has removed dialers from the App Store in mid-2009, 
only users who got a dialer before then have the option. The other option 
is to jailbreak your iPhone, that is, to disable certain protections that allow 
Apple to both control and support it. If you do this, you may void your war­
ranty, and you may risk Apple electronically locking your phone. However, 
you will be able to run apps not approved by Apple.
If you don’t have access to a dialer for your iPhone, use the information here 
and the section on the Google Voice mobile site in the previous chapter to 
use Google Voice on your iPhone.
Using dialers with iPod Touch
	
The full Google Voice Web site, the GV Mobile site, and iPhone Google Voice 
dialers — if you have one or can get one — work on the iPhone and . . . wait 
for it . . . the iPod Touch as well.
Uh, how do they do that, you wonder?
All of these tools let you set which of your phones to ring when you call 
out from your iPhone or iPod Touch. When you use this capability on your 
iPhone, it’s a convenience. You would normally take the Google Voice call-
back on your iPhone, of course. However, you may want to have the call-back 
come to another phone that you have registered with Google Voice. That 
way you avoid using cell phone minutes, leave your cell phone free for other 
incoming calls or texts, or use a nearby land line handset because it’s more 
comfortable to use.

213
 Chapter 11: Using Google Voice with the iPhone
(Come on, don’t tell us you’ve never sent texts from your cell phone while on 
a boring landline call. We’ve done it, too.)
What may be surprising is that you can use the same capability on your iPod 
Touch. Run a Google Voice dialer on your Touch and set it to ring back to 
one of your Google Voice-registered phones. You get all the advantages of 
managing contacts, running GV Mobile (see last chapter) or the full Google 
Voice Web site on your Touch — which is just as good, for all these purposes, 
as an iPhone — and use your phones as extensions to Google Voice. Cool, huh?
Finding out what dialers are available
At this writing, three major Google Voice dialers were available on the App 
Store until mid-2009 and then were pulled. Each has its fans:
	
✓	VoiceCentral, shown in Figure 11-2, began back in Grand Central days. 
It kept legacy support for GrandCentral for users making the transition 
alongside Google Voice support.
	
✓	GVdialer is a multi-phone application that runs on iPhone (until it was 
pulled), BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Symbian and Android phones, the 
widest range of any Google Voice dialer.
	
✓	GV Mobile, shown in Figure 11-3 does much the same as the previous 
dialer, though it’s said to do so with more polish.
Which of the Google Voice dialers for the iPhone is best?
It’s tough to give a good answer, especially as the applications may be 
updated, either as apps for jailbroken phones or if they’re allowed to return 
to the App Store. Some people prefer a dialer, like GVdialer, that works the 
same across several smartphones. Others will like an iPhone-specific applica­
tion. GrandCentral users who’ve been using VoiceCentral for years may not 
want to change in any event, especially as Riverturn, its publishers, have 
done a good job of keeping it updated.
Now that none of them is available in the App Store, each will no doubt keep 
its existing users over time. GVdialer will certainly appeal to companies that 
adopt or support Google Voice and want one app to support across multiple 
phones. However, we like GV Mobile a bit more so far.
As this is written, we have some reason to hope that Apple will reverse its 
decision at some point and allow the apps into the App Store again. Perhaps 
someday there will even be an official Google app, as there is for BlackBerry 
and Android phones.
In the meantime, the only option available at this writing to most iPhone 
users is the Google Voice Mobile Web site described in the previous chapter.

The developer of the most popular Google Voice dialer, GV Mobile, has 
released the app for jailbroken iPhones on one of the better-known sites for 
unofficial iPhone apps. Unfortunately, to use it requires that you jailbreak your 
iPhone — change its system software in a way that will void its warranty, stop 
it from getting system software updates, and stop it from being able to use the 
App Store.

 Chapter 11: Using Google Voice with the iPhone
We recommend that you not jailbreak your iPhone just to get GV Mobile. If 
you’ve already taken this very big step, though, you may want to take a look 
at GV Mobile, if you haven’t already.
Using Workarounds If You 
Don’t Have a Dialer
If you don’t have a dialer, in addition to using the GV mobile site, there are 
two workarounds you can use to speed dialing your contacts using your 
Google Voice number.
The first workaround is to create new phone number entries for desired con­
tacts with a special version of their phone number. Use this combination:
	
✓	Your Google Voice number, such as 4085551212. This dials Google Voice 
for you.
	
✓	The Pause button on the “+*=” keyboard. This pause, which shows up 
as a comma, gives your Google Voice voice mailbox a chance to answer 
your call. Use two pauses to make sure the delay is long enough.
	
✓	2 to tell Google Voice to place a call.
	
✓	The Pause button again, while Google Voice gets ready for the outbound 
number.
	
✓	The number you’re calling, such as 4085553434. This dials your contact’s 
number for you.
	
✓	The pound sign, #. This tells Google Voice definitively that you’re done 
entering the destination number.
	
✓	Check the result. It should look like this: 4085551212,,2,4085553434#. If 
you use a password for your Google Voice voicemail, put the password 
and a pause just after your Google Voice number. If your password were 
5555, the result would look like this: 4085551212,,5555,2,4085553434#.
	
✓	Add extensions. You may be able to dial a work extension by adding a 
pause and the extension number before the pound sign at the end.
	
✓	Try the result. You should test at least a few of these numbers to make 
sure you’re doing it right.
	
✓	Replicate it. Go through as many of your contacts as you care to and 
add a Google Voice-friendly version of their phone number(s). You can 
cut and paste all the digits in front, but remember to also add the pound 
sign (#) at the end.

Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
That’s it! Sorry for all the extra work, compared to using a dialer. Perhaps the 
dialer situation will change and make life easier. Until then, though, you can 
make using Google Voice easy by investing the extra time to do this setup 
work in advance.
You should also create a contact for dialing Google Voice, which allows you 
to then dial any number you need to, and a contact for GOOG-411.
There is another way. An online tool has been created that generates Safari 
bookmarks for quick access to your favorite phone numbers. It takes some 
work to get started with it, but after the first time, the method is quick and 
easy. To try it, visit:

Is the iPhone the best choice?
The desire for certain features drives people’s 
choice of cell phones. Google Voice is the 
mother of all features for a cell phone to have. 
So is the iPhone the best of all possible phones 
for Google Voice?
Unfortunately, no longer. Not having a dialer is a 
major impediment to effective usage compared 
to BlackBerry and Android phones, covered in 
the next two chapters.
When it comes to using the Google Voice Mobile 
Web site though — which even dialer users 
have to do to change certain settings when on 
the move — the iPhone is a very good choice. It 
has the largest screen of any mainstream phone 
out there. That, and the support of gestures on 
the excellent touch screen, makes Web access 
easier than on any other mainstream phone. 
(As shown by the fact that a preponderance 
of mobile Web site visitors are iPhone users.) 
So you can handle an awful lot of things on an 
iPhone that would otherwise have to wait until 
you had computer access.
The iPhone also has a full keyboard, though it’s 
an on-screen keyboard without mechanical 
keys. (The best such keyboard ever, according 
to many users and reviewers.) It also has the 
App Store, which is a strong and growing “fea­
ture” of the iPhone that, to date, no one else 
can match, even after the dialers controversy. 
The iPhone also has what is probably the larg­
est community of owners who also use Google 
Voice, giving you lots of compatriots who can 
give advice and share tips.
Any currently contented iPhone user will prob­
ably not switch away just to get a phone with 
a dialer for Google Voice. Those looking for a 
new phone and wanting the very best Google 
Voice experience as their #1 priority (and who 
are attracted to the lower prices available from 
TMobile’s service plans) may look to phones 
running Android ahead of the iPhone before 
making a final decision.

Using Google Voice on 
Android Phones
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding why Android is a natural fit for Google Voice
▶	Checking out dialers for Android phones
G
oogle is involved in a lot of different areas beyond its original focus of 
Internet search and search-related advertising. One long-awaited ven­
ture was a mobile phone operating system called Android.
Android has gradually gained popularity among phone-buyers and software 
developers alike. The platform reached the key benchmark of 1 million users 
in mid-2009. This does not sound like many compared to the roughly 40 mil­
lion each for iPhone and BlackBerry, but it represented a starting point for 
further growth. Android is widely believed in the tech industry to have fan­
tastic potential for growth.
We predict a proliferation of Android-based phones over the coming years. 
Because Android is customizable, and because it runs on phones from many 
different manufacturers, a lot of potential exists for variation in Android 
phones. Some may be relatively poor hosts for Google Voice, or even rela­
tively poor phones; others may be among the very best for both.
So far, Android users are very active among smartphone users in accessing 
the Web. They “punch above their weight” compared to Windows Mobile or 
BlackBerry users. In mid-2009 Android users reached about one-tenth the 
mobile Web use of the leader, iPhone, despite having a much smaller percent­
age of the market.

218
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
Using Android: A Google Voice Natural
Android’s software development kit is made available to anyone who’d like to 
tinker, and all for free.
Android is inherently well suited to mobile Web usage. iPhone is a natural 
platform for using the Web on the move; Android is roughly as well suited. 
Though smaller, it’s moving up quickly. A few months after Google Voice was 
initially released, Google released its own dialers for BlackBerry and Android.
The BlackBerry app was competently designed but not amazing. (See the 
next chapter.) The Android dialer, however, is a breakthrough. See Chapter 
10 for a brief introduction to dialers.
Google’s dialer for Android makes the smartphone it’s running on act as a 
handset for the user’s Google Voice number. All calls and texts can come to 
and from the Google Voice number natively; the underlying T-Mobile phone 
number can be made nearly invisible. (The underlying number can still 
receive calls and texts, but outgoing calls and texts can all be made to origi­
nate from the Google Voice number.)
All this is possible thanks to Google’s extensive control over the so-called 
Google phones. On the technical side, Google “controls the horizontal and 
the vertical,” as Rod Serling used to say when introducing the Twilight Zone. 
Google wrote the operating system, and it’s working very closely with its hard­
ware partners, including HTC, Sony, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, LG, 
and other members of the so-called Open Handset Alliance. That means Google 
can optimize a Google Voice dialer to work with them at a system level. It can 
even change the Android operating system or the Google Voice offering itself 
to create a seamless experience for Google Voice users on Android.
On the business side, Google is somewhat fortunate in being a new entrant 
without large market share or revenues to defend. They can move faster, 
offer more functionality, and take more risks. There’s little but upside for 
Google and its initial U.S. carrier partner, T-Mobile, in making Android a truly 
excellent platform for Google Voice. Google and T-Mobile share a need to 
offer the best possible experience for users and to ramp up their customer 
base quickly, even if they lose a chance to make a few extra pennies here or 
there. In the best Internet tradition, they can build up a customer base today 
and figure out the fine points of building up revenues later.
Android also is probably the player with the most potential to build an appli­
cation store to rival Apple’s wildly successful App Store. Like Apple, Android 
is relatively easy to develop for. It has an open marketplace — Android 
Market, shown in Figure 12-1 — and its phones, unlike BlackBerry phones, are 
far less likely to be “locked down” by a corporation or government agency 
before being issued to employees. All this is attractive to many developers 
and should contribute to a growing range of Android Market apps.

Using Dialers for Android Phones
Android was quick to get the multi-platform GVdialer soon after Google Voice 
was announced. It seems, though, that other developers knew Google would 
be creating its own dialer and stayed out of the way.
The minutes problem and Android phones
As we mentioned in Chapter 2, a downside to 
using Google Voice is bigger for some people 
than others. That’s the problem of not getting 
free minutes within a cell phone calling plan 
when you use Google Voice.
T-Mobile, at this writing the only U.S. carrier to 
offer Android phones, has a calling plan fea­
ture called myFaves. You can specify up to five 
numbers — T-Mobile numbers or not — to call, 
or receive calls from, free of any use of your 
calling plan minutes. Set your Google Voice 
number as a Fave, and your GV calls won’t burn 
minutes.
However, even T-Mobile, friendly to Google 
though it is, needs revenue. The ability to use 
a Google Voice number as a myFaves number 
may not last forever.
T-Mobile also has unlimited T-Mobile to 
T-Mobile calling on myFaves plans at $50 a 
month or more. The number of T-Mobile users 
is far less than with AT&T or Verizon, so this 
is unlikely to apply to very many of your calls. 
Also, with the flexibility of Google Voice for 
using different phones, and its ability to send 
and receive texts for free, you may well be able 
to keep your plan under the limit, meaning you 
wouldn’t get the discount anyway.
All in all, Android phones on T-Mobile are per­
haps the least likely to cause you extra expense 
by missing out on “bennies” from your carrier, 
and to cause frustration among friends and 
family who might otherwise have been count­
ing on free calls of their own.

220
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
Smart move. The mobile app — different from the GV Mobile site described 
in Chapter 10 — is completely integrated with Android phones. (There’s still 
a bit of separation on BlackBerry, as we describe in the next chapter, and it’s 
reasonable to expect there will be on the iPhone as well.)
To get the app, visit:
m.google.com/voice
Alternatively, go to Android Market and search for “google voice”.
The official Google Google Voice app — try saying that three times fast — is 
shown in Figure 12-2. It’s almost 100 percent integrated with Android phones’ 
built-in features:
	
✓	No log-in: Google Voice logs in using stored credentials; no need to 
enter a password to use it.
	
✓	Choice of when to use the GV number: You can choose to use the 
Google Voice number as the “calling from” number none of the time; to 
use the Google Voice number only for international calls; to check which 
number to use on every call; or, a choice many will make, to use the 
Google Voice number all the time.
	
✓	The default dialer app: When you call out from Android using your 
Google Voice number with the new app, calling is quick. You use the 
default dialer, not a substitute.
	
✓	No intermediate phone call: When you call out from Android with the 
new app, you still use the default dialer. The call goes out to the user 
just like a call directly from your cell phone; there’s no detectable call­
back to you from Google Voice.
	
✓	Call from contacts: You can place calls using your Google Voice number 
as the originating number from your contacts list.
	
✓	Free SMS: SMS text messages come in and go out through your Google 
Voice number even if your phone has no SMS service.
	
✓	Voicemail integration: Voicemail transcripts are displayed in Android’s 
message list, with no need to visit the GV Mobile Web site.
	
✓	“Karaoke-style” voicemail playback: When you’re looking at a text tran­
scription and playing back the audio from a voicemail message, each 
word in the transcription is highlighted as the audio plays back. This 
makes it much simpler to listen attentively only to the bits that are puz­
zling in the transcript. (No, your spouse didn’t tell you to pick up “gar­
bage” at the store; it was handwash.)
	
✓	Google Voice as voicemail recipient: On many handsets, you can set 
your Google Voice number as the voicemail recipient even for calls 
to the phone’s native number. This is a great trick for moving over to 
Google Voice completely.

221
 Chapter 12: Using Google Voice on Android Phones
	
✓	Background notifications: Notifications for voicemail and SMS come in 
even when the app is not active. (Only when you have data coverage, 
though; carrier-provided notifications come in over the voice network 
and so are available more of the time.)
	
✓	Integrated contacts: If you use Google for your contacts, changes you 
make in your native contacts or in Google Voice carry over to the other.
	
✓	Call history: Your call history is displayed in the native Android display.
	
Figure 12-2: 
The official 
Google 
Voice dialer 
for Android.
	
The only visible failures to integrate are in messaging — that is, SMS text 
messages and MMS multimedia messages:
	
✓	Separate SMS: Instead of coming in through the clean and capable 
Android SMS application, the app has its own SMS view. (Which does 
support threaded conversations, thank goodness.)
	
✓	Slow SMS: SMS comes in slower through the app than through carrier-
provided SMS.
	
✓	No MMS: As with the GV Mobile site, there’s no MMS support. This may 
be one of those features that gets put off from an initial release and gets 
done later.
For most of us, the features that have been left out so far aren’t deal-breakers — 
the Android app is a coup for GV users.

222
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
With the Google Voice app for Android, you can simply use your Google 
Voice number from your cell phone full-time, almost completely as if it were 
the phone’s native number. This is a pretty impressive implementation and 
sets a high bar yet to be matched on other phones.
Braving the Android frontier
Google Voice is the most important cell phone 
“feature” to come along in a long time. Are 
phones running Google Android, with the extra 
integration afforded by the best version of 
Google’s app for Google Voice, the best choice?
Unfortunately, the answer is yes and no. Yes, 
the integration of Google Voice with Android 
is truly outstanding. At the time of this writing, 
Android phones are the only devices that allow 
you to use your Google Voice number as your 
native cell phone number. The initial Android 
phones are very strong offerings, and there are 
perhaps even better ones to come.
The only minus is that you have to be a bit brave 
to go on Android today. It has quality applica­
tions, but not yet the sheer number and variety 
of the App Store. You may be the first on your 
block with an Android phone. The way things 
seem to be going, though, you probably won’t 
be the last.
If your main concern in a smartphone is that 
it works optimally with Google Voice, then 
Android is clearly your best bet. If, like most 
people, you are weighing a wide range of fac­
tors when making a phone choice, Android’s 
Google Voice integration puts it in the mix. If 
you’re already well established in the iPhone 
or BlackBerry camps, even the strong per­
formance of Google’s app for Google Voice is 
unlikely to pull you away. If you’re truly open-
minded, there’s a very good chance you’ll 
become an Android user soon.

BlackBerry Phones

▶	Finding out if BlackBerry is a natural for Google Voice
▶	Learning how to use a dialer on BlackBerry
▶	Identifying whether BlackBerry is the best choice
L
ong-time users of BlackBerry phones from Research in Motion (RIM) 
have been through a mania of enthusiasm for the BlackBerry, followed 
by depression as first the iPhone, and now Android phones have stolen the 
limelight from BlackBerry.
Now the BlackBerry line is getting more attention as RIM adds new models, 
winning plaudits for features and styling. BlackBerry phones have a very good 
Google Voice dialer, from Google itself. While not quite as well-integrated as 
the Android dialer (see Chapter 12), Google Voice fits into the BlackBerry envi­
ronment very well, alongside all the other advantages that make a BlackBerry a 
“must-have” for millions.
BlackBerry: Cool Then, Cool Again
A few years ago, having a BlackBerry was the pinnacle of cool. BlackBerry 
phones were the only phones that could handle e-mail reliably, so BlackBerry 
users were that much more in touch than anyone else. Figure 13-1 shows an 
early BlackBerry model.
Because most BlackBerry phones were issued by corporations and more 
often to senior or technical people than others, having a BlackBerry implied 
that you were well-off, powerful, and well-connected. The term crackberry, 
describing the addictive power of always-on e-mail, was declared New Word 
of the Year in 2006 by Webster’s New World College Dictionary.

224

Figure 13-1:

Recently, though, Google did its part to undermine the unique appeal of 
BlackBerry by making Gmail so flexible that it could be used on a cell phone 
and still stay in sync with Web and desktop access to the same e-mail 
account. They also made Gmail directly available on cell phones through 
Gmail applications.
What really took the glow off the BlackBerry, though, was the arrival of 
the iPhone in 2007. Suddenly there was a mobile device hotter than the 
BlackBerry, and not only were corporations not issuing it, they didn’t even 
like having them in the building. (An iPhone running the Gmail app is, for 
instance, a very good way to get around corporate restrictions on the use of 
Web-based e-mail applications.)
The iPhone’s touch screen made the BlackBerry’s famous scroll wheel, which 
is actually a robust little tool, look quaint and limited. Its excellent music 
player integration embodied coolness and let people combine two devices, 
phone and iPod, into one.
What really hurt RIM, though, was the way in which, judo-like, Apple made 
one of RIM’s strengths into a weakness. RIM kept a tightly closed shop and 
discouraged third-party developers from creating applications to run on 
BlackBerry. Corporate data processing departments loved this restrictive 
policy, which kept them firmly in control.
Once the iPhone came out, though, every new app that appeared in the 
iTunes App Store (there were more than 50,000 as of mid-2009) was an indict­
ment of RIM’s closed shop.
RIM woke up fast. A slew of new BlackBerry models have drastically updated the 
“look and feel” of the line to be more consumer-oriented, with high-resolution 
screens, stereo headphones and social networking apps. There are about 30 mil­
lion BlackBerry owners as of mid-2009, second to the iPhone’s 40 million users.
The BlackBerry Curve, shown in Figure 13-2, is an example of a phone with the 
best features of BlackBerry — an excellent keyboard, good positioning control 
via a trackball, BlackBerry’s easy-to-use core software — plus a camera and 
multimedia features and the ability to download and install applications.

BlackBerry has quickly opened up to developers and now has its own store, 
App World, shown in Figure 13-3. App World is, for now, second only to 
Apple’s App Store in number of applications. (Many expect the Android 
Market to surpass it soon.)

Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
Although the number of phones has expanded rapidly, BlackBerry’s main­
stream phones still tend to have certain things in common:
	
✓	The best-loved integrated keyboards in the business, designed for use 
with one’s thumbs and quite quick for text entry.
	
✓	High-resolution but small screens with the same resolution in pixels as 
the iPhone — that’s 480 x 320 pixels — but half the size physical size, 
about 3 square inches. (The Storm is the exception, with a screen about 
85 percent the size of iPhone’s.)
	
✓	No touchscreen support (except for the Storm), but use of a trackball 
instead.
These features tend to make BlackBerry phones excellent e-mail clients, not 
only for corporate e-mail, as in the past, but for Gmail and other Webmail 
services as well. The small screen and lack of touchscreen support conspire 
together, though, to make BlackBerry smartphones poor mobile Web clients — 
except the larger-screen, touchscreen Storm. (BlackBerry users tend to visit 
customized BlackBerry mobile Web pages for news updates, weather, and 
so on. Time magazine is only one of many publishers who have published 
BlackBerry-specific sites.)
These advantages and disadvantages tend to make BlackBerry smartphones 
good for Google Voice, but with different strengths and weaknesses depend­
ing on the specific BlackBerry model. BlackBerry smartphones are also good 
for replying to voicemail via SMS or e-mail, because they take advantage of 
the generally excellent keyboards that BlackBerry phones boast.
However, lacking the larger screens and nearly complete Google Voice inte­
gration of Android phones, and the very large screens and range of Google 
Voice clients and other apps of the iPhone, the BlackBerry line — except for 
Storm — has challenges in keeping up with the other major smartphones as 
a tool for Google Voice. And that’s before you consider the skepticism of the 
large organizations that still issue Blackberry phones by the millions.
	
If you want to see a well-stated case for what makes a BlackBerry worthwhile, 
look no further than the essay, Why BlackBerry, on CrackBerry.com:
http://crackberry.com/lecture-1-why-blackberry
The essay covers all the major points in favor of BlackBerry smartphones, 
along with some not-so-scientific arguments. (Example, by a female author: 
“Women with BlackBerrys are HOT.”)

 Chapter 13: Using Google Voice on BlackBerry Phones
Using a Dialer on BlackBerry
The official Google Voice dialer for BlackBerry phones is excellent, second 
only to the Android version for integration. It’s shown in Figure 13-4.
	
Figure 13-4: 
The official 
Google

dialer for 
BlackBerry.
	
It’s a good thing the dialer is strong, because using the GV Mobile or the full 
Google Voice Web site is not easy with the BlackBerry’s limited Web access. 
In fact, a customized BlackBerry version of both sites is really needed to keep 
BlackBerry in the running with Android and iPhone as a Google Voice handset.
Banned in Boston (and New York 
and Washington and…)
The attitudes of corporations to Google Voice 
will be hard to predict, as it usually takes 
them a while to formulate a response to new 
technology.
One thing we can specify in advance, though: 
if your work issues you a BlackBerry, or 
other mobile phone, and tells you not to use 
Google Voice on it, that’s what you should do. 
If your employer, having provided you with a 
BlackBerry, tells you more broadly not to use 
your Google Voice number for work, that’s what 
you should do, too. This applies even more 
strongly if they issue you a laptop as well.
However, if your job expects you to use per­
sonal resources — your own cell phone, your 
own cell phone service plan, your own com­
puter — for work, they can’t really expect to 
control what tools you use on your own hard­
ware, cell phone service plan and so on to 
get the job done. You would still need to obey 
any direct corporate diktat not to give out your 
Google Voice number as your official work 
number, put it on your business card etc. It’s 
hard to see, though, how you could be criticized 
for giving out your Google Voice number on an 
as-needed basis, as you might have previously 
given out your personal cell phone number, if 
that’s what it takes to get things done.

228
Part III: Maximizing Your Handset 
To get the app, visit:
m.google.com/voice
The dialer is very good, and just slightly less well-integrated than the Android 
version. Here are the good points:
	
✓	Call from contacts: You can place calls using your Google Voice number 
as the originating number from the BlackBerry address book. The 
Google Voice app must be running for this to work. BlackBerrys support 
multitasking, so that’s not necessarily a big ask.
	
✓	Free SMS: Send SMS text messages to and from your Google Voice 
number.
	
✓	“Karaoke-style” voicemail playback: As you play back the audio from 
a voicemail message in the app, if the transcription is displayed at the 
same time, each word in the transcription is highlighted as the audio 
plays back. You can focus on the words that are puzzling in the tran­
script. (Your boss didn’t say your pay raise was temporary; she said to 
commit the amount to memory.)
	
✓	Background notifications: Notifications for voicemail and SMS come in 
even when the app is not active. (Only when you have data coverage, 
though; carrier-provided notifications come in over the voice network 
and so are available more of the time.)
The only visible failures to integrate are in the dialer and in SMS text mes­
sages and MMS multimedia messages:
	
✓	Separate call log: Voicemail transcripts are displayed in the app’s voice­
mail list, rather than in the BlackBerry’s phone interface. This still saves 
you a trip to the GV Mobile Web site.
	
✓	Uses a separate dialer app: When you call out from a BlackBerry using 
your Google Voice number with the new app, you have to use a separate 
dialer, and you get a call-back, both unlike the Android version. The 
green Phone button can’t be made to dial out from your Google Voice 
number.
	
✓	Separate SMS: Instead of coming in through the clean and capable 
Android SMS application, the app has its own SMS view. (Which does 
support threaded conversations, thank goodness.) SMS messages and 
notifications come into your regular message/SMS folder and the appli­
cation, which means more cleanup.
	
✓	Slow SMS: SMS comes in slower through the app than through carrier-
provided SMS.

229
 Chapter 13: Using Google Voice on BlackBerry Phones
	
✓	No shortcuts support: You’ll want to reply to SMS text messages from 
within the Google Voice application, but when you do, BlackBerry short­
cuts such as double space for a period at the end of a sentence don’t 
work. After a period, the next letter isn’t automatically capitalized. 
These missing shortcuts are a big deal for BlackBerry users who have 
these rules hard-wired into their thumbs.
	
✓	No MMS: As with the GV Mobile site, there’s no MMS support. This may be 
one of those features that get put off from an initial release to a later one.
The list of plusses is long enough to make a real difference in using Google 
Voice. The minuses are significant but, for most of us, not show-stoppers. 
Work can be done to improve the BlackBerry version of the app up to the 
same level as on Android, assuming Google wants to do that work.
Going with a BlackBerry phone
It would be hard to argue that BlackBerry 
smartphones are the best choice for Google 
Voice. Integration is better on Android. Even 
if integration improves with future releases 
of the Google Voice app, the small, non-touch 
screens and less Web-friendly nature of most 
BlackBerry smartphones works against their 
being a first choice for Google Voice.
As with other aspects of BlackBerry smart­
phones, the Storm and its relatively large, 
touch-sensitive screen is the exception. If other 
BlackBerry smartphones go in the same direc­
tion as the Storm, they’ll be good choices, too.
However, the physical keyboards on most 
BlackBerrys (again, except the Storm) make 
them very good for e-mail. If you like to use 
e-mail to respond to voicemail, you may like 
using Google Voice on your BlackBerry very 
much.
Even with today’s lineup, as a BlackBerry user, 
you’ll be well-served by Google Voice and 
the app that Google provides. It’s an excel­
lent addition to any BlackBerry user’s toolkit. 
Few BlackBerry users would willingly switch 
away from RIM, and Google Voice doesn’t 
require you to.
BlackBerry is the right choice today for tens of 
millions of users, a number that continues to 
grow steadily. The availability of Google Voice 
is a plus for BlackBerry users, even though it’s a 
stronger plus for Android users. If you are truly 
free to make your own choice in the market­
place, though, Google Voice is a stronger plus 
for Android than for BlackBerry today.

oogle’s product offerings are becoming more numerous, more power­
ful, and more successful. That’s as a group; individual offerings can 
come and, sometimes suddenly, go. Google Maps will be with us for a long 
time; Google Lively, Google’s virtual reality offering that appeared in mid-
2008, did not make the cut.
In this chapter we describe how Google Voice works with Google’s success­
ful and ever-more-popular e-mail offering, Gmail, and briefly introduce other 
important Google products. This orientation to Google’s offerings can help 
you get the most out of Google Voice.
A key change in how you work with your phones using Google Voice is the 
fact that it sends copies of text messages, voicemail transcriptions, links to 
voicemails, and phone call recordings to your e-mail Inbox. By moving this, 
traffic becomes easier to track and manage. You may find yourself replying to 
a voicemail with an e-mail after you start using Google Voice.
Having this traffic in e-mail, though, also puts new demands on your e-mail 
Inbox itself. Having “on the go” access to your e-mail Inbox from various loca­
tions becomes all the more important.
Gmail is easy to use and flexible, making it a great fit for these demands. We 
recommend setting up a Gmail account to handle all your Google Voice noti­
fications, so that they don’t clog up your regular Inbox. After you start using 
it, though, you may become a convert and switch over to Gmail for all your 
e-mailing.

Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
In this chapter, we describe how to use Gmail with Google Voice and briefly 
touch on Google Voice integration with other Google applications. In the next 
chapter, we go into depth on other real-time communications applications 
offered by Google or directly supported by Google Voice: Google Talk, Google 
Chat, and Gizmo 5.
Exploring What Makes Gmail Cool
Gmail has many attractive features; some in common with other top free 
e-mail providers, others that distinguish Gmail from the rest:
	
✓	Easy access: You can access Gmail and its main competitors (Microsoft 
Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail) from any Web browser, anywhere in the 
world, at any time of day or night.
	
✓	Easy smartphone access: Gmail has applications for the top smart­
phones that take maximum advantage of each phone’s screen space to 
produce a crisp, clear display of messages. Figure 14-1 shows Gmail’s 
Blackberry application running on the Blackberry Curve. Android 
phones and the iPhone are the most fully supported.
	
✓	Easy dumbphone access: The Gmail Web page works on any cell phone 
that can run even a basic Web browser.
	
✓	Large storage capacity: Gmail offers more than seven gigabytes of e-mail 
storage for free and increases this number constantly.
	
✓	Smart forwarding: You can set Gmail to forward certain messages to 
other e-mail accounts, and it’s smart enough to know which messages 
you want to forward and which you don’t.
	
✓	Easy integration with Outlook and Apple Mail: Google works hard to 
keep up-to-date instructions available for integrating Gmail with current 
and past versions of Outlook, Apple Mail, and others. Figure 14-2 shows 
configuration instructions for several IMAP mail clients.
	
Figure 14-1:

Curve.

 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
	
✓	Easy management of multiple accounts: You can set up Gmail to import 
e-mail from other accounts into Gmail and even to reply to it with the 
other account showing as the sender.
	
✓	Easy integration with other Google applications: After you sign on to 
your Google account, you get access to more and more capabilities. 
Google Voice is one of the latest and greatest. Having the same buttons 
and features across products — right down to keyboard shortcuts — 
helps keep things simple.
	
✓	Google Labs access: Google’s experimental arm, Labs, is always working 
on cool stuff, and some of it is especially useful for Gmail. For instance, 
Message translation allows you to translate Gmail messages you receive 
into other languages. Message translation is potentially useful with 
voicemail transcriptions, as described later in this chapter.
	
Figure 14-2: 
 Gmail 
encourages 
you to 
integrate 
it with 
your e-mail 
client.
	
Gmail is also well-integrated with other Google interactive communications 
applications, such as Google Chat, as described in Chapter 15.
Gmail has only a few disadvantages. One is that a Gmail address for your 
e-mail might not be taken as seriously as a “real” company or organizational 
domain; “gmail.com” might not look as good as “grozcorp.com”. Many 
people, though, ignore this problem, or work around it by running organiza­
tional mail through Gmail while using their own domain.

236
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
Many people have Gmail accounts and have stuck with them for years. 
However, you may not want to move over to using Gmail as your main e-mail 
account if you have another one that you’ve been using for years.
Another disadvantage to Gmail is that it unalterably uses something called 
“message threading” to display messages in groups by their subject lines, 
and that can be confusing. The final disadvantage is that Gmail, like any 
Webmail package, is sometimes blocked on PCs inside large organizations, as 
explained in the next section.
Using Gmail for Google Voice
Gmail’s features make it a great place in which to receive your Google Voice 
text message copies, voicemail message notifications, and links to record­
ings, even if you don’t use your Gmail account for anything else.
Is Google the new Microsoft?
Years ago, applications such as Lotus 1-2-3, 
WordPerfect, and Harvard Presentation graph­
ics were leaders in PC software; Microsoft 
applications were less popular than the bigger 
players. Since then, Microsoft has made a lot 
of money by realizing that people might be will­
ing to leave these once-familiar applications 
for slightly less powerful applications that were 
more similar to one another. Gathered together 
with Microsoft Outlook, a breakthrough new 
application for managing e-mail, Microsoft’s 
Office software package quickly became the 
industry standard, earning tens of billions of 
dollars. Office emphasized convenience and 
standardization just as much as long lists of 
features.
Now Google is taking advantage of people’s 
desire to share information and to have online 
tools that work the same to offer its own suite of 
applications and services. Google Search is the 
leader and the biggest money-maker, thanks 
to Google Adwords advertisements. Google 
Search is a tool nearly everyone who uses a PC 
or smartphone takes advantage of, the “straw 
that stirs the drink.” It serves as a front door to 
the entire Internet for many of its users.
Google Voice has the potential to achieve the 
same kind of success. Google Voice can be 
the front door to the entire world of voice and, 
increasingly, online video communications 
between people. Google Voice may eventually 
include ads directly, or it may simply contribute 
useful user information to make possible better 
targeting of ads in Google Search, Gmail, and 
elsewhere.
The Google brand is already ranked as the 
world’s most powerful brand in some surveys. 
With Google Search, Google Voice and sup­
porting services such as Gmail, Google Apps, 
and others, Google is currently valued by the 
markets at about half the overall company value 
of Microsoft, and growing significantly faster. 
Within a few years, Google may indeed take 
over the mantle of leading technology giant 
from Microsoft.

237
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
Gmail is
	
✓	Free: Gmail is free, which is pretty amazing, considering that its avail­
able storage and features lead the competition in most ways.
	
✓	Independent: Gmail is independent of your job, your school, your home 
ISP and other connections that may change over time.
	
✓	Cell phone-accessible: Gmail offers easy access from cell phones, which 
is great for voice/e-mail interoperability.
	
✓	Flexible: Gmail is able to juggle complex demands such as work vs. per­
sonal e-mail use.
	
✓	Adaptable: Gmail is particularly easy to integrate with other e-mail clients.
	
✓	Google Apps-compatible: Gmail is easy to integrate with other Google 
applications, such as Google Voice and Google Chat.
Search deserves special mention. The powerful capabilities of Google Search 
are particularly welcome in dealing with the explosion of messages you can 
expect when your e-mail Inbox is full, not only of e-mail messages but voice­
mail messages and SMS text messages as well.
	
Search depends on specific words, and words are defined by their spelling. 
It’s hard enough to remember specific words that might have occurred in a 
voicemail message without having to account for the fact that the automatic 
translation used by Google Voice might have garbled the spelling, but you’ll 
have to work around it. The same applies, for slightly different reasons, to the 
accidental errors and deliberate compressions that take place in SMS mes­
sages composed in txtspk. In both cases, small errors that don’t prevent intel­
ligibility may well be enough to prevent searchability.
Large storage, a key feature of Google Voice, may become even more impor­
tant over time as well. People may end up with decades of voice, SMS, e-mail, 
and mixed-mode conversations, all stored and searchable, in their Gmail 
accounts — but only if the space available is big enough. Gmail’s 7GB (and 
growing) should be enough to accommodate just about all users.
To sum up, the barriers to entry for Gmail are low; interoperability and fea­
ture count are high. Nothing else that is currently available offers as good a 
choice for the specific needs of Google Voice users.
Using Gmail inside the firewall
Large organizations have many security precautions in place. The best-
known such barrier is the firewall, networking software that keeps out many 
viruses and other malware, but that also prevents some Web sites from work­
ing properly. This crippling of Web capabilities is sometime accidental and 
sometimes purposeful on the part of the organization.

238
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
In particular, large companies are famous for deliberately preventing access 
to Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, and other important personal applications 
from corporate PCs. Why do they do it?
The answer boils down to two words: security and productivity. Security 
because Gmail and its competitors may let in e-mails that a properly main­
tained corporate e-mail capability would keep out. These e-mails can bring in 
viruses, worms, and all sorts of other problems.
Gmail and its competitors are also likely to carry some inappropriate 
content — potentially obscene material, potentially defamatory statements, 
and so on — that is problematic for the corporation to be hosting, even at 
arm’s length. (Especially when employees forward more or less “humor­
ous” e-mails from Gmail and so on to colleagues over the corporate e-mail 
system.)
The other, related reason Gmail and its ilk are banned is productivity. It’s 
easy to waste time in an office environment, or to use time productively but 
in a way that benefits only you, not your employer. Gmail can be a big time 
sink. So employers keep it out to hog your time themselves.
These steps help the organization maintain its standards, but they create 
problems as well. It’s actually helpful to employees to be able to handle a cer­
tain amount of personal business at work, so they can better concentrate on 
their jobs the rest of the time. Many of us have seen work fax machines being 
used to transmit mortgage application forms for personal use, for example. 
Occasional use of organizational facilities of this type is usually allowed.
Is Gmail ready for prime time?
Google has put itself in an odd situation. It’s 
busily selling its Google Apps suite to corpora­
tions. Yet the core product in the suite, Gmail, 
still has a “beta” tag on it.
Traditionally, in software development, an 
“alpha” version was the designation for early-
stage version of the software that worked, but 
might have some planned features missing. 
Eventually the alpha version matured into a beta 
version, which was “feature complete” but not 
fully debugged. After beta came Release 1.0, the 
first “finished” version of the product. (Though 
wiser heads often waited for a “dot release”, 
an update often numbered 1.0.1, or something 
similar, that squashed a few more bugs.)
Google has adopted the strange habit of con­
tinuing to designate many of its important prod­
ucts as beta even after it has millions of users 
for them; for instance, one estimate is that 
Gmail currently has about 50 million users.
Don’t let the beta tag throw you off; it’s probably 
a sign of Google’s corporate sense of whimsy, 
not of the stability of the software. Gmail is more 
feature-rich and seems to be just as reliable as 
its main competitors, Microsoft Hotmail and 
Yahoo! Mail, neither of which is labeled beta. 
We’ll all be a bit relieved, though, when Google 
gets Gmail to a point where it determines that it 
doesn’t need the beta label anymore.

239
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
Having Gmail completely cut off stops this kind of mutually beneficial activity 
and can often give employees e-mail anxiety, where they rush for any oppor­
tunity to get to a PC that isn’t locked down to check for a specific message or 
just whether anything important has come in.
The answer a great many people employ is to use a cell phone to check their 
e-mail. Gmail really shines, because of its simple text-based mobile interface 
and light, fast smartphone applications. Using those tools from your phone 
can help you manage Google Voice notifications, SMS text messages, and 
transcriptions using Gmail from anywhere, even at work.
	
Well, almost anywhere. The secure area in the State Department, various spy 
agencies, and the military prohibit use of even the coolest smartphones. One 
government employee has the pull to cut through the regulations: Barack 
Obama fought for and won permission to keep using his Blackberry as 
President, as shown on the White House blog in Figure 14-3. (Visit http://
blogs.america.gov/obama/2009/01/page/3/ to see the story for 
yourself.) Staffers can use Blackberries too; during official White House meet­
ings, the devices have to be left in a basket at the door. “Yes we can” indeed! 
Obama has also been spotted with an iPhone and even a Microsoft Zune 
player as well.

Gmail and the kitchen sync
The most crucial issue in using any e-mail program is synchronization — 
keeping the message lists straight on different computers.

240
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
You can use two approaches. One is to always keep the “live” copy of your 
e-mail on your PC, which is fast but restrictive and ties the lifespan of your 
e-mail to the lifespan of your PC. It’s about as safe as e-mail gets — certainly 
safer than phone or Internet cafe. The other is to always keep it on a server, 
which is flexible and potentially safer but slow and useless when you don’t 
have a connection to a server.
There’s also a complex approach, which is to keep the master copy on a 
server, a local copy on one or more PCs, and other devices for speed, and to 
synchronize the two as often as practical. This problem is one of the hardest 
in all computing and one that Google and Gmail tackle head-on.
These last three graphs are more complicated than they need to be. Some 
people use software that downloads their e-mail from the server where it 
lives onto their computer, and others just check it using the Web.
There are two standards-based approaches for e-mail synchronization — 
keeping your Web-based e-mail and clients such as Microsoft Outlook in 
sync. The older and simpler one is called POP, for Post Office Protocol. Its 
basic intention is to download e-mail from a server, which acts like a digital 
post office serving the mailbox on your computer. For security, the POP 
server can keep a copy, but it isn’t intended to reflect all the changes you 
make on your computer’s mailbox, as when you delete or move messages 
between folders.
The more modern and complicated approach is called IMAP, for Internet 
Message Access Protocol. IMAP takes on the job of keeping e-mail lists syn­
chronized among a server and the computers and phones that access your 
e-mail. With IMAP, you can check your e-mail from various devices; you 
can send new e-mail, delete old messages and so on from any client and the 
others will reflect the change.
Both of us use it, one (Smith) for synchronization with Outlook on a PC and 
a Blackberry Curve, the other (Dannen) for synchronization with Apple Mail 
on two Macintoshes and an iPhone. Each of us also uses e-mail from various 
Internet cafés and borrowed PCs. We each have piddling gripes, but get along 
pretty well with these complex e-mail setups.
Touring Gmail for Google Voice
Gmail is relatively easy to sign up for and use, yet it has enough capability 
that explaining all of it could take up a good part of a book. In fact, it does 
take up a good part of a book: Google Apps For Dummies, by Ryan Teeter and 
Karl Barksdale (Wiley, 2008), has coverage of Gmail. So please see that book 
for the details on Gmail and the entire Google Apps suite.

241
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
Here we offer a quick tour to help you decide whether to use Gmail and just 
how much of your e-mail traffic you want to run through it. You may make 
the same decision as we have: use Gmail for just about all of it!
The Google Voice Inbox
The key to daily use of Google Voice for many people is the Inbox, where you 
see all your Google Voice e-mail. A typical Inbox — well, the Inbox of one of 
the authors, which may or may not be typical — is shown in Figure 14-4.
	
Figure 14-4: 
Gmail has 
one of the 
better-
known 
Inboxes 
around.
	
A few items are worth noticing here, some good and some perhaps not so 
good, depending on your point of view:
	
✓	No column headings: Note how there are no column headings over the 
list of e-mail message headers to designate the sender, topic, and date 
sent. In a typical Windows application these columns have headings, 
and you can sort the display by a field by clicking on its heading. But 
Gmail may have tens of gigabytes of data stored for a user. It’s not going 
to take on responsibility for sorting a display of the message headers for 
all of it. Being Google, it would rather you search.
	
✓	Threading: Gmail presents messages as conversations (Google’s term) 
or threads (what most people call them). Any exchange of messages 
(dictated by one user clicking reply to another’s message), even if it’s 
dozens of messages deep, shows up as a single conversation in the 
Gmail Inbox. More on threading later. . . .

242
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
	
✓	Labels: Outlook, among other e-mail clients, is able to store e-mail in var­
ious folders. Not many people have the discipline to use them properly, 
but one of us had a colleague with five years’ worth of e-mails neatly 
filed — and easily retrievable — in scores of folders. Gmail has mapped 
its e-mail labels to Outlook’s folders to preserve appearances, if not full 
functionality, between one and the other.
	
✓	Ads: Gmail has low-key text ads, currently positioned at the top of the 
Inbox or other window. It’s weird, at first, to see ads more or less spe­
cific to the content of your recent e-mails appearing in Gmail. However, 
one of us (Smith) has found several useful links here, including one that 
saved hundreds of dollars in car rental costs on a trip. Most users give 
these ads, at least in their current form and corresponding low level of 
obtrusiveness, a pass or even a guarded thumbs up. Others sometimes 
find them hilariously mismatched to the content of the e-mail.
Of course Gmail’s Inbox has additional features, as you might expect. One cru­
cial feature is the ability to quickly start a voice or video chat — see the next 
chapter — with someone you’re corresponding with. It’s easy to As Google Voice 
becomes more widely used, a phone call might be added to the options soon.
The most amazing part, of course, is that it’s all free. Of course, “free” really 
means ad-supported. With Gmail, though, as with watching the Super Bowl, 
the ads are part of the fun.
If you’re part of an organization with 50 users, want more storage per user, 
and/or want to get rid of the ads, you can pay a per-user charge currently set 
at $50 per user per year.
For a Top 10 list of Gmail features from Google itself, visit http://mail.
google.com/mail/help/about.html. The list includes useful links to 
details about parts of the offering that may be important to you.
Google’s designs are usually driven by the results of user interface testing, to 
such an extent that designers have quit the company in protest. Yet there is 
one important point where Google has not yielded to sometimes vociferous 
public opinion: the exclusive use of threads in Gmail.
Most e-mail clients, whether PC-based or server-based, present e-mails one at 
a time. Some of them, optionally, offer some degree of threading — messages 
that are replies to each other shown together as a group. No major e-mail 
client except Gmail presents all e-mail exchanges in threaded form and does 
not offer an option to show them as individual messages.
The problem with threads is that the time sequence of e-mails is somewhat 
obscured. Conversations move up or down in your Inbox depending on the 
timing of the most recent message, but only the new part — the most recent con­
tribution to the exchange — is highlighted, as shown in Figure 14-4. And the new 
bit can be somewhat buried in the overall exchange. Finding a particular mes­
sage or attachment, for example, among layers of them can be quite difficult.

243
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
There may be a generational gap here. It seems that younger or newer e-mail 
users “get” the threaded interface well and are happy to benefit from the 
compression it offers. These users are quick to use search to dig out any­
thing specific that’s needed.
Older, experienced users are more likely to recoil in horror from the idea of 
their carefully crafted, memo-like messages being slipped into a conversa­
tional stack like a slice of cheese in a cheeseburger. These users tend to want 
to sort their e-mails by date — doubly impossible in Gmail — and search 
the message headers of individual messages to help find the specific thing 
they’re looking for.
Figure 14-5 shows the display of an e-mail in Google Voice within its overall 
thread. You can see that it’s not necessarily easy to get to a specific interme­
diate message.
Fortunately, there’s a workaround that many of us cling to like a floating log 
after a flood. Gmail works well with Microsoft Outlook, and Outlook displays 
messages one at a time. Individual messages can be stored in folders, sorted 
and, yes, searched. Apple users use Apple Mail to get the same effect.
This capability is so important that Google has introduced new software spe­
cifically to improve the synchronization between Google mail, address books, 
and calendars with Outlook. Microsoft, to the shock of many, is working 
closely with them to help make it work better.
Non-threaded capability is also so important that many users have looked for 
an online tool that would organize the view of Gmail online into a form more like 
Outlook’s. No such tool has gained enough traction to be widely used as yet.
Google seems happy enough to provide the plumbing and let Microsoft pro­
vide the user interface to legacy Outlook users. The company seems to be 
Google Voice and the Gmail Inbox
The specifics of how the Gmail Inbox works are 
especially important for Google Voice users, 
because the way you manage voice traffic will 
change once you’re using Google Voice. You 
end up handling a lot of voice traffic by send­
ing an e-mail reply or otherwise taking action 
in e-mail. Text message copies, Google Voice 
notifications, voicemail transcriptions, and links 
to conversation recordings serve as the bridge 
taking you from voice world into e-mail world.
Good arguments exist for both Gmail’s conver­
sations and the more typical one message at 
a time approach with regards to the messages 
that come from Google Voice. Putting more of 
your life in your Inbox just increases the pres­
sure on your e-mail program to do exactly what 
you want, exactly when you need it.

244
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
taking the long view in the belief that it can educate new generations of users 
who prefer viewing e-mails in its preferred conversational format, while sup­
porting Outlook and Apple Mail to keep legacy users and others from rebelling.

Important Gmail features
One of the key features of Gmail is its forwarding flexibility. Part of that is 
the way it interoperates with other e-mail accounts. Figure 14-6 shows the 
Accounts and Import features of Gmail.
Gmail enables you to:
	
✓	Import e-mail and contacts from Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, AOL, and other 
kinds of accounts. Google is making it easier for more people to move to 
Gmail.

245
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
	
✓	Change your name and Reply to addresses. This feature helps you get 
your e-mail where you want it. For example, if you use Gmail only for 
Google Voice notifications, change the Reply-to field so replies go to 
another e-mail account.
	
✓	Receive e-mail into Gmail from other POP3 accounts. By itself, this 
feature is again Google making transition from your other account(s) to 
Gmail easier.
	
✓	Change your Send from e-mail address depending on the account it 
came from. That’s right; if someone sends an e-mail to, say, your Hotmail 
account, you can have Gmail get it for you. When you reply to it — in 
Gmail — the reply-to address can be set to your Hotmail address as well. 
So you can “do” Hotmail without ever opening Hotmail!
	
Figure 14-6: 
 Gmail 
helps you 
give a good 
account of 
yourself.
	
	
See the next section for important options relating to how Gmail handles mail 
coming in from other POP accounts.
The Account and Import features are helpful, and in some cases vital, for 
working with Google Voice notifications. For instance, you could use your 
Google Voice number for work, personal use and perhaps even an additional 
business that you have on the side. Each of these may go through a different 
e-mail account.
You can use Gmail as a bit player for your Google Voice notifications only; as 
a peer among other e-mail accounts that you also check; or as one account to 
bind them all, a master account that spoofs other accounts when needed.

246
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
By being so flexible, Gmail is becoming part or all of the e-mail solution for 
more and more people. You may find it useful for Google Voice at first and 
perhaps for more of your needs over time.
Forwarding through the fog
Along with dealing directly with your other accounts, as described in the previ­
ous section, Gmail can automatically forward e-mail to other accounts — and 
flexibly deal with its own copy. Figure 14-7 shows the Forwarding and POP/
IMAP features of Gmail.
	
Figure 14-7: 
Gmail offers 
fast, flexible 
forwarding.
	
One of the most important features in all of Gmail is contained in two little 
links, one each in the Forwarding and POP/IMAP Settings area: the two links 
that say Configuration instructions.
These links take you to instructions on how to configure various e-mail cli­
ents to work with Gmail, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Many 
companies would just tell you “their side” of what to do and leave it up to 
you to find your e-mail client’s documentation and cross-reference the two 
into a solution.
Google takes on the whole job, explains the steps for the whole process, and 
helps you actually get things done. These can be very important instructions 
indeed, a real lifeline when you are moving from one computing environment 
to another and need to get things working quickly.

247
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
The Forwarding and POP/IMAP features allow you to use POP or IMAP so a 
mail client such as Outlook can pull e-mail from Gmail to your PC. Use POP 
if you want to support basically one-way traffic to your PC; use IMAP if you 
want to keep the server and local PC copies synchronized with each other.
	
Gmail has an All mail folder that can help you avoid big problems. If you have 
PC trouble or otherwise lose access to your current Inbox, or completely 
delete an important e-mail, you can always dig it out of your All mail folder.
As with other Gmail features, the forwarding and POP/IMAP features take 
on particular importance with Google Voice. With these features, you can 
coordinate just where your notifications are available and whether they stay 
synchronized between systems.
Translating Transcriptions
Google Labs is the public face of Google Research and Development. Labs 
Alumni — Google services that have come through the Labs into wide­
spread use — include GOOG-411 (refer to Chapter 7), and Google Docs and 
Spreadsheets.

Gmail-specific ones in the Settings tab of Gmail, as shown in Figure 14-8.

248
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
We recommend checking this area regularly to see if there’s anything in it 
that can be particularly helpful. One feature that may be particularly interest­
ing with Google Voice is Message translation. Google Translate is put to work 
translating your e-mail messages.
This service is potentially powerful when used with voicemail transcriptions. 
You can have transcriptions translated and then send them on to colleagues 
or friends who speak other languages.
Of course, the result of an inaccurate machine translation of an inaccurate 
machine transcription may range from wrong to completely unintelligible. 
But for long messages, you can use a Google Voice transcript as a start­
ing point for a translation — many times all they require is punctuation to 
become syntactically correct.
	
What’s hilarious in some contexts may be embarrassing, misleading, or worse 
in others. Always let recipients know if a translation is likely to be anything less 
than perfect and consider getting professional help if the translation is at all 
important.
	
The voicemail transcription that makes sense when you read it today may not 
make sense some time down the road. It also may not make the same amount 
of sense to other people, and it certainly won’t translate as well as a “cleaned 
up” copy would.
So consider using the Note capability, as described in Chapter 8, to add a 
note to important transcripts you receive. Then copy and paste the transcrip­
tion into the note and clean up or annotate as necessary. This record will be 
much more useful to you, and also more useful as input to Google Translate.
Translating a transcription?
Just how bad is a translation of a transcription 
likely to be?
A transcription might only be 60 percent accu­
rate on a word-for-word, letter-for-letter basis, 
but be 90 percent understandable by a skilled 
reader who understands the context: you!
A machine translation, on the other hand, gets 
the worse of the odds. Translation has very 
little chance of correctly translating a word 
that’s even slightly mistranscribed. Worse, 
machine translation looks at phrases as well; if 
there’s a single mistake in a phrase, that error 
may make several words in a row difficult to 
translate correctly.
At best, if the transcription is 70 percent accu­
rate, and the translation is 70 percent accurate, 
the translation of the transcription will be 49 
percent accurate. The math works like this:
.70 x .70 = .49 (or, 70% of 
70% is 49%)
If you want to use Google Translate with Google 
Voice voicemail transcriptions, consider edit­
ing them. Then you can get the best out of the 
translation, and the result is likely to be helpful 
to your audience, though not perfect.

 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
Giving Voice to Google Apps
As you start using Google Voice, and perhaps add Gmail to your toolkit, or 
even move to it completely, you may want to consider using other Google 
products as well.
Google products are largely linked together and have a more and more con­
sistent interface across core offerings. (Newer and non-core offerings can be 
idiosyncratic.)
However, there are so many of the darn things that you could recoil from all 
of them. So here’s our quick survey, emphasizing those that are most promis­
ing for Google Voice users.
At the top of the screen in its core products, Google lists several offerings 
it thinks are important or most wants to promote. Those top few, and their 
applicability to Google Voice, are:
	
✓	Gmail: Very important to Google Voice.
	
✓	Calendar: An application for scheduling, greatly helped by Google’s col­
laboration capabilities. Calendar is a good thing to use as you build up your 
Google Contacts via Google Voice, especially as you evangelize friends, 
family, and business contacts to become Google Voice users as well.
	
✓	Docs: Allows collaborative work on word processing, spreadsheet, and 
presentation-style documents. Not as powerful as the Office applications 
we’re all used to, but much better for sharing. The Docs offering is not 
particularly applicable to Google Voice.
	
✓	Photos: A pointer to Picasa, which is both an application (Picasa 3) that 
runs on your computer and an online site, Picasa Web Albums, for shar­
ing photos online.
	
✓	Reader: A way to gather updates from your favorite Web sites online. 
Not particularly applicable to Google Voice, but good for getting inter­
esting information to share.
	
✓	Sites: Google Sites is a way to create Web sites that incorporate Google Docs 
and other Google features. This feature may be better suited to intranets 
and other collaborative sites than to a typical public-facing Web site.
Most of these offerings are also featured under the heading of Google Apps, 
as shown in Figure 14-9. For personal use, Google Apps is just a container for 
Google’s products. But for organizations (businesses pay one rate, schools, 
and nonprofits another) Google Apps is much more.
Google Apps allows Google to host e-mail and calendaring for organizations. 
These offerings are usually integrated with address book management and a 
domain name, under the title Google Apps for your Domain, to form a fairly 
complete solution.

If you are among the small but growing number of people who are using 
Google Apps for your Domain customers, you cannot, at this time, use Google 
Voice with your Google Apps for your Domain log-in. That means you have 
to get a personal Google account. Therefore, you may run into some prob­
lems Google is currently having with keeping Google Apps for your Domain 
accounts separate from the personal Google accounts of the same users. Be 
careful, and talk to your IT team in your organization about how to keep the 
two separate. (Never signing into both of them from the same machine, nor 
at the same time, might do it, but that’s a lot to ask. You can’t sign into two 
Google ID’s on one machine unless you use two browsers, which most people 
don’t do, except for nerds like the authors.)
Searching for stuff
With Gmail’s habit of threading conversations, 
how’s a poor person supposed to find their 
message?
Well, it’s Google’s mail offering, and Google is 
all about search. So the answer is, “Seek and 
ye shall find.” Gmail search options are power­
ful. Experienced Gmail users often search in the 
Gmail Web client to find messages they can’t 
find in Outlook or Apple Mail.
Start by searching your mail by using the Search 
box at the top. If that’s not enough, click the 
link, Show search options, next to the Search 
box at the top of the Gmail window. Search 
options appear across the top of the window. 
Alternatively, click Create a filter to route mes­
sages by topic, sender, keyword, and more.
Gmail search has many operators that 
allow you to search specific fields, such as 

251
 Chapter 14: Using Google Voice with Gmail
“from:chris” or “subject:book”. The same oper­
ators work in filters. For a complete list, search 
Gmail help, or go directly to http://mail.
google.com/support/bin/answer.
py?answer=7190.
Experiment with Gmail search until you get 
good at it; it’s very important for working around 
Gmail’s limitations. One thing it can’t work 
around is misspellings; unlike Google Search, 
Gmail search doesn’t even try to find “sounds 
like” spellings, similar spellings, or words that 
share a stem, such as does, doesn’t, and don’t.
One thing to look out for is that you may have 
trouble finding a message because it’s been 
wrongly (from your point of view) put in the 
Spam folder, but Search doesn’t look in the 
Spam folder by default. The only workaround is 
to use the Search pull-down to choose Spam 
as the specific target, or Mail & Spam & Bin 
together.
Searching through Mail & Spam & Bin is a bit 
like emptying all your wastepaper bins and file 
folders onto the floor before starting to look 
for something; you’re likely to have to wade 
through a lot of junk, but you’re more likely to 
find what you’re looking for. Or at least to have 
the cold comfort of knowing that it probably 
can’t be found.
The ability to mount a search like the one in the 
figure shows off one of the strengths of Gmail. 
Its intent is that you take advantage of its huge 
storage to never delete anything, at least not 
from your All Mail folder. This allows you to 
have a deep, ongoing record of all your e-mail; 
an advantage extended to your phone calls if 
you use Google Voice and Gmail together.

Beyond the products highlighted in the taskbar that shows up across Google 
applications, Google has many other offerings, as shown in Figure 14-10. Of 
interest to Google Voice users may be Translate, mentioned earlier as a tool 
to consider using on Google Voice voicemail transcripts; Google Groups, 
which are great for sharing files and comments in a group with interests or 
activities in common; and Alerts, which are particularly good for keeping up 
on topics you’re interested in. (We use it to keep informed about develop­
ments with, and comments on, Google Voice while writing this book.)

Not mentioned on the More Google products page, but also important are 
Blogger, a very easy to use blogging tool; Google Maps, which is integrated 
into Google Voice as part of the GOOG-411 offering; and of course YouTube, 
which has no direct relation to Google Voice but is a whole lot of fun. (And 
which hosts a lot of useful videos on Google products, including Google 
Voice.)

Chatting, Talking, and 
Using Your Gizmo
In This Chapter
▶	Too much talk?
▶	Using Gmail Chat
▶	Using Google Talk
▶	Using Gizmo 5
G
oogle is the proud owner of 70 percent of the Internet searches done 
in the U.S., but when you’re becoming a giant octopus, your tentacles 
are bound to get tangled up . . . so it may seem with Google’s voice- and 
conversation-related offerings.
Google has Google Voice, Google voice search, Gmail Chat (also called Google 
Chat) and Google Talk. It also has tie-ins, in Google Voice, to Gizmo5, a sort of 
online telephone.
In this chapter, we explain what all these terms mean and help you focus on 
the ones that will make a difference alongside your use of Google Voice.
Untangling the Spaghetti of Offerings
We have to admit it: each of us has been using Google offerings for years, 
and we’ve been focused on Google Voice since the day Google announced it. 
Yet we still get confused among several of Google’s offerings that have similar 
names and closely related — even overlapping — functionality.
The offerings are:
	
✓	Google Voice: The topic of this book; lets you control your existing tele­
phones from a Google-based control panel and more.

254
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
	
✓	Google voice search: Google voice search was once a separate tool, but 
it’s now integrated into GOOG-411 (see Chapter 8), Google Maps, and the 
Google Mobile App for smartphones.
	
✓	GmailChat: Available only within Gmail, Gmail Chat simply allows you 
to chat — that is, to send instant messages — to your contacts when 
they’re online. It even supports group chats. You can also use Gmail 
Chat in third-party clients such as Trillian, iChat (for Mac), and Adium.
	
✓	Google Talk: A superset of Gmail Chat, Google Talk requires a separate 
Windows-only software download and runs in Gmail or in a separate win-
dow. It provides text chat, free PC-to-PC voice chat, and even video calls 
from computers to other computers.
	
✓	Gizmo5: Gizmo5 is not a Google product, but you can set up a Gizmo5 
client running on a PC as one of your forwarding phones for Google 
Voice. Refer to Chapter 3. No other non-Google phone product gets this 
kind of support from within Google Voice.
There’s no direct integration between Google Voice and either Google Chat 
or Google Talk. The more you “go Google,” though, in your choice of what 
tools to use, the more likely you are to find yourself using Google Chat or 
Google Talk.
How to undercommunicate
All the wonderful communication options 
described in this book, especially the several 
complementary ones described in this chapter, 
can lead to overcommunication, the feeling that 
you can’t get away from people who want to 
interact with you.
A startup, Slydial, has come up with a new way 
to undercommunicate. Have you ever wanted 
to leave someone a voicemail without actually 
talking to them? Call it disingenuous or call it 
savvy, but you’ll probably end up using it.
With Slydial, you call into Slydial, at 267-SLYDIAL 
(267-759-3425), and then enter the number you 
want to almost connect with. You listen to a 
ten-second advertisement, which is your way 
of paying for the service, then you’re connected 
to the victim’s, er, recipient’s voicemail. Leave 
your message and hang up.
Slydial passed the 1 million user mark late in 
2008, and the number is sure to increase now 
that there’s a Slydial smartphone application. 
You can Slydial your contact without dialing the 
Slydial number or the recipient’s number. Just 
pick ‘em and trick ‘em.
Now some people much prefer texts, but 
Google Voice gets around voicemail hell. You 
might even encourage people to do this to you 
via your Google Voice number. With Google 
Voice’s voicemail notification and transcription 
capabilities, you get a version of the message in 
your e-mail Inbox, along with a link to the voice­
mail message. You can respond by e-mail, so 
you and your “caller” will have successfully 
conspired to remove any risk of ever actually 
talking to each other at all.

255
 Chapter 15: Chatting, Talking, and Using Your Gizmo
Using Gmail Chat
Gmail Chat is a simple, instant messaging-type capability built into Gmail, as 
shown in Figure 15-1. You can easily upgrade to add Google Talk, which adds 
voice and video capability on either Windows or Macintosh, as we describe 
in the next section.
The idea behind Gmail Chat is that you’re spending a lot of time in Gmail 
anyway and you easily see which of your contacts are available to chat (a 
green circle); not available (an empty circle); or available to chat, but with 
chatting blocked (a red circle with a horizontal dash).
For those with a green circle, you can chat by using text instead of e-mailing. 
But workplaces, groups of friends, and so on tend to congregate around one 
solution of this type or another. If Gmail Chat is the solution one or more of 
your groups begins to congregate around, you may find it useful for more and 
more of your interactions.
Gmail also saves all the transcripts of your chats. This is great when you 
need to refer back to a bit of information in a chat, but may be disconcerting 
when you go searching through your e-mails and find an exchange from a 
half-forgotten chat instead.

Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
What does this have to do with Google Voice, you wonder? Well, Gmail Chat is 
a convenient halfway point between exchanging e-mails, which can be slow and 
cumbersome, and having a phone call (or voice chat or video call), which can 
demand more attention. Google Voice moves a lot of your voice traffic into your 
e-mail Inbox, so if you use Gmail, as recommended in the last chapter, along with 
Google Voice, Google Chat becomes a nice additional option to have.
You, gentle reader, will be far from the only person to start using Google 
Voice in the coming months and years. Many people who start with Google 
Voice will also adopt Gmail or increase their use of their pre-existing Gmail 
account. As Google’s suite gets increasingly able, you’re likely to find that 
more and more of your friends, acquaintances, and business colleagues are 
Gmail users and therefore accessible through Gmail Chat.
	
To invite people into Gmail, and thereby potentially into Gmail Chat as well, 
click the Invite a friend button in the lower-left corner of the Gmail screen. A 
list of some of your most frequently contacted contacts appears, as shown 
in Figure 15-2. Choose the ones you want and type any additional e-mail 
addresses in the text entry box. You can use, clear, or change the note that 
Google provides; you may want to mention something about how nice it would 
be to have the option of using Gmail Chat together. Then click Send Invites to 
invite them.

 Chapter 15: Chatting, Talking, and Using Your Gizmo
	
This chapter is already pretty nerdy, but what the heck: if you really want to 
get the most out of Gmail, you might think the Google Labs tab in Gmail is the 
ultimate in nerdiness. Not even close. To really geek out, visit Gtricks at www.
gtricks.com. Author Abhishek Mandloi has add-ins to improve Gmail, Gtalk, 
and more. They may or may not be fully tested and quality controlled, but 
they’re bound to be fun.
	
You can chat with people who don’t have a Google account by adding what 
Google calls a chatback badge to your blog or other Web page. Visit www.
google.com/talk/service/badge/New to get the code. (There’s a capital 
letter in that Google-supplied URL! Don’t tell us some Google people don’t 
know UNIX?)
Put the badge in any Web page. The badge shows if you’re available and 
invites people to chat with you. You can even have several separate chats 
running at once.
You can combine the chatback badge with a Google Voice Call Widget, as we 
describe in Chapter 8. Then you can offer your Web visitors multiple ways to 
be in touch with you.
Google Talk
Google Talk adds voice and video communication to Gmail Chat within Gmail. 
It also runs in a separate window where you can chat, or have a voice call or 
a video call, as shown in Figure 15-3. (You can only have a group chat, using 
text not voice or video in Gmail Chat, though.)

Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
You have to download Google Talk if it’s not already set up on your com­
puter. Just click the link, Try video chat, in Gmail, as shown in Figure 15-1. A 
dialog box opens to allow you to install the needed plug-in.
After you install Google Talk, a camera icon appears next to the names of 
other Google account users who have Google Talk installed. (Users of non-
Windows machines may get the same effect with other software.) You can 
find details of all this and more in Google Apps For Dummies by Ryan Teeter 
and Karl Barksdale (Wiley, 2008).
Not everyone has the equipment for a voice chat (headphones with a micro­
phone help a lot) or video chat (you need a webcam). Also, different people 
feel differently about text chat, voice chat, and video chat, just as they do 
about older, better established forms of communication such as a phone call 
or stopping by for a — here’s the word again — chat.
Is SkypeIn?
We love Google Voice, but we come not to bury 
Skype but to praise it. Skype is a marvelous 
invention. Skype brought free international calls 
over the computer to the world, followed by free 
video calls. Homes, offices, and Internet cafés 
around the world are full of people talking to 
friends, loved ones, and business partners for 
free over Skype.
SkypeIn and SkypeOut allow you to interact 
with real phones at very low prices, and mobile 
support, to enable low-priced calls on the 
move. The cell phone support usually depends 
on the availability of a wireless network and is 
banned by many cell phone service providers, 
so check before assuming you can use it on 
your cell phone.
Skype, unlike Google Voice, uses VOIP (Voice 
over Internet Protocol) technology for most of 
its work. This sometimes means reduced call 
quality and even dropouts, but the prices are so 
low that for most purposes it’s worth it.
At this writing, Google Voice has Skype beat on 
prices by a little bit, and with better call quality. 
But Skype works both ways all over the world; 
in fact, it’s less popular in the U.S. than it is in 
many other countries, perhaps largely because 
people in these countries travel and work inter­
nationally more than most Americans. For the 
lowdown on Skype, see Skype For Dummies by 
Loren Abdulezer and others (Wiley, 2007).
There’s no reason not to continue, or even start, 
using Skype right alongside Google Voice and 
the other Google-supported options described 
in this chapter. In fact, by making you more 
aware of your many phone calling options, and 
by making you allergic to paying high prices for 
any calls at all, using Google Voice may make 
you more likely to use Skype as well.
Besides saving money, though, there isn’t that 
much in common between Skype and Google 
Voice; they’re similar in purpose but mostly 
complementary as to which “user scenarios” 
they support. So there’s no harm in using both, 
and even good reason to do so.

259
 Chapter 15: Chatting, Talking, and Using Your Gizmo
After you’re properly equipped, Google Talk increases your options greatly, in 
ways that some people find marvelous and others find intrusive. You may find 
yourself, initially, spending as much time establishing equipment adequacy 
amongst your contacts and sussing out their preferences among means of com­
munication as you do actually conversing with them.
	
The connection to Google Voice is clear: Google Talk just gives you even more 
ways to communicate, and always for free, but limited to calls on your PC. 
International calls on Google Voice use real phones, but cost money. (Not much, 
but a bit.). With Google’s offerings, and the many other ways to communicate 
being made possible by PCs (see Gizmo5 below), it’s a cheaper and easier, as 
well as a smaller, world.
	
What’s really nice with Google Talk, in addition to low price, is the ease of 
moving among e-mail, chats, voice, and video calls. For one thing, a phone call 
can be a massive interruption. Because these PC-based alternatives begin by 
allowing you to see who’s online and who’s declared themselves available, 
you’re less likely to disrupt fellow chatters. If you want to give the other person 
plenty of notice, an online voice or video call can be easily begun with an invita­
tion via chat or e-mail.
	
Google Talk interoperates with many other chat clients — none that I (Smith) 
had ever heard of, except iChat on the Mac, but that doesn’t mean other clients 
aren’t very important to their developers and users. The current list at the time 
of writing is shown in Figure 15-4; for an updated version, visit www.google.

Gizmo5
Gizmo5 is a SIP phone, a virtual phone that runs on a PC, Mac, or Linux box, 
as well as on dozens of models of cell phones. See the “Just a little SIP” sidebar 
for a brief explanation of SIP.
	
A SIP phone is a virtual phone even when it’s running on a handset, because 
all the required phone-specific functionality is running in software. To a SIP 
phone, any specific hardware is just a replaceable host.
Gizmo5 allows you to make very cheap calls indeed over the Internet. Gizmo5’s 
dependence on the Internet means that you need wireless network access 
and service provider permission, or at least acquiescence, to use it on a 
mobile phone.
There are a lot of VOIP and SIP options that Google could have chosen to 
support rather than Gizmo, whose Web site is shown in Figure 15-5. Why 
Gizmo5?
We aren’t privy to all the reasons, which might include business connections 
between Google and Gizmo, shared venture capital funding, or even just old 
school ties. But from an outsider’s point of view, Gizmo5 seems relatively 
mature, and it has a vital tool for Google Voice integration: a hidden, but real, 
phone number.

Just a little SIP
You could spend a lot of time and mental energy 
learning about SIP, which stands for Session 
Initiation Protocol. It’s used for creating and 
ending voice and video calls over Internet 
Protocol. We admit to not fully understanding 
the diagram in the figure, for instance. If you 
need to understand it, start by visiting Wikipedia 
and looking up Session Initiation Protocol.
We do know what a SIP phone is, though. It’s 
a telephone, whether real or virtual, that runs 
over IP (Internet Protocol). If anyone asks 
you what Gizmo5 is, just tell them it’s a virtual 
Session Initiation Protocol phone running over 
IP. Then, while they’re scratching their heads 
trying to figure out what you said, you can make 
your escape before they ask you to explain 
it.With Gizmo5’s phone number you can use it 
as a virtual, but very useful, forwarding phone 
from Google Voice. You can use your Gizmo5 
SIP phone right alongside your cell phone, 
home phone and so on.

case you’re interested. (We are, like, totally)
	
You can use Gizmo 5 and Google Voice to make free calls from the Web that 
don’t even use minutes from a cell phone plan. With an SIP phone (see the

Using Google Voice for Business
In This Chapter
▶	Comparing Google Voice to Google Search
▶	Google Voice use by employees
▶	Google Voice in small business
▶	Training on Google Voice
▶	The enterprise and Google Voice
G
oogle Voice can offer a great deal of savings and capability to businesses 
and organizations. But because Google Voice is a consumer-based tool, it 
doesn’t have all the things a business needs to make full use of it.
Yet Google Voice is too capable for business to ignore. It offers too much 
in efficiency, too much in cost savings, and will be taken up by too many 
employees and competitors for business not to try to make use of it. How a 
business might best do that is the subject of this chapter.
Using Search in Organizations
Google Search has been one of the secrets of making the Web really useful 
in organizations. As the Web has become more useful, organizations and 
individuals have invested more time, effort and money in their Web sites and 
related services such as blogs. As they have done so, there’s been more and 
more to find, making search ever more important. Google has largely kept up 
with the challenge.
In larger organizations, in fact, Google Search presents a big comparative 
challenge. Large organizations typically have very large amounts of data 
they keep internally, accessible via the company intranet. The challenge that 
Google Search presents is that it’s too good; employees in large organizations 
constantly complain about their inability to find things on intranets.

264
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
The Nielsen Norman Group is among the leaders in promoting high standards 
for intranet design. Their Intranet Design Annual, shown in Figure 16-1, high­
lights ten intranets they name as the “best” each year. This report is particu­
larly valuable because the key aspect of intranets is that you usually can’t 
easily get a look at anyone else’s.
Now a situation similar to that with Google Search may unfold with Google 
Voice. Consumers and small businesses can take full advantage of Google 
Voice to save money and to provide convenience for all concerned, as we’ll 
describe below. Bigger businesses won’t be able to use it much or even at all, 
as it doesn’t match their concerns for security, reliability, and control.
	
Figure 16-1: 
Nielsen

Group rates

A business or an organization?
We’re abusing the term business here. Most 
of what we’re describing applies not only to 
businesses but to all organizations, including 
governments, non-profit organizations, and 
schools. However, each of these has its own 
specific concerns in addition to the usual con­
cerns of a business.
So we’re using the term business here in 
the way many others do: to describe actual 
for-profit businesses as well as the business-
type concerns that other organizations have. 
What we don’t account for is the specific 
concerns of each type of non-business orga­
nization, because those concerns can be quite 
complex and, to an outsider, quite arbitrary. 
Sometimes, we can say from experience, they 
seem arbitrary to the insiders as well!

265
 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
We begin by describing how Google Voice works from an employee’s point of 
view, the most important perspective of all. We then show you how to get the 
most possible out of Google Voice in smaller and larger companies, and why 
the end result may leave people in large organizations unsatisfied.
Whatever your role in business, it’s good to read all three parts, so you can 
best look for opportunities to get the most out of Google Voice and offerings 
from other vendors.
Google Voice for Employees
For an employee, Google Voice is wonderful. Used properly, it can help you 
get key messages from home without disruption. Your cell phone behaves 
better too, causing fewer unneeded interruptions, with all manner of controls 
and notifications to put you in charge.
With Google Voice, you can do a much better job of not having personal calls 
ring your cell phone during the work day; just assign various callers to voice­
mail. If you use Groups properly, you can do this with just a few clicks.
Even though you are blocking many or all calls, you can still get back to 
people relatively quickly by using the SMS text message forwarding, e-mailed 
voicemail notifications, and voicemail transcriptions that Google Voice pro­
vides. And these tools keep you out of “voicemail hell” much of the time, 
avoiding the situation where you miss a crucial business message that’s 
hidden between long, “how ya doin’” messages from friends and family.
Voice mail is becoming a topic of national and international discussion. 
Publications such as the New York Times have discussed its failings at length. 
People get so many messages they can’t deal with them all, and voice mail 
messages are the hardest to deal with, because messages often have to be 
listened to in the order received and because listening, unlike reading, can’t 
easily be sped up.
Having Google Voice notifications come to your personal e-mail account, 
such as a Gmail account, is convenient. Some employers frown on, or even 
actively ban, use of personal e-mail services such as Gmail at work. You can 
check Gmail on a cell phone or set Gmail to forward messages to your work 
e-mail during the workday.
	
Gmail’s flexibility makes it particularly good for routing messages from Google 
Voice. A simple way to do this is to use the Gmail option that forwards a copy 
of messages to your work, but also keeps a copy for Gmail. (See Figure 16-2.) 
That way you can deal with the work copy as a disconnected notification that 
you can delete if it doesn’t require immediate action, without prejudice to 
your ability to later reply to it, search for it, store it, or otherwise do as you 
want with it in your Gmail account.

you have to.
	
	
It does take some self-discipline to manage your personal life successfully 
during the workday using Google Voice. It further pierces the veil many of us 
try to keep between our work and our personal lives. Try to use Google Voice 
to help you be aware of any emergencies or important opportunities, while 
deferring as much as possible of the other stuff until your own time.
	
The Do Not Disturb feature, found on the General tab of the Settings menu of 
the Google Voice Web site, is a good one to use at work. Use it to give yourself 
a real break from the phone during a meeting or at lunchtime. This setting 
sends all your Google Voice calls to voicemail. You still see voicemail notifica­
tions and SMS text messages in your e-mail Inbox, so you won’t be too far out 
of reach — just far enough to focus on people, get time to yourself, or devote 
uninterrupted chunks of time to getting work done. The Call Presentation and 
Call Screening features can be good ones to turn on during the workday as 
well. All of this may create some fun for couples and families. Couples may 
have to negotiate whose Google Voice account gets used as the home number. 
If a spouse, partner, or children, especially older children, are involved, you 
may also have to get quite good at routing callers who are trying to get to the 
home phone to actually ring that phone when someone other than the Google 
Voice account holder is at home.
Using Google Voice features at work
Previous chapters in this book have covered setting up Google Voice (Part I) 
and using its features (Part II) pretty thoroughly, so hopefully you’ve gotten 
to use it by this point. But how do its features apply especially at work?

267
 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
Here’s a quick magnificent seven list of Google Voice features that make a dif­
ference at work:
	
✓	Free U.S. calls, cheap international calls, and impromptu conference 
calls. Voice can save your company money and save you the hassle of 
filing an expense report for calls you make. It can also keep you from 
having to come into the office at odd hours to make international calls 
just for the ability to conference or put the call on the company tab. 
Google Voice generates a very small bill and has its own conferencing 
capability.
	
✓	Call screening, ListenIn, and blocked calls. Call screening and ListenIn, 
which is referred to as Call Presentation in Google Voice settings, 
ask callers to say their names if they’re calling from a number that’s 
unknown or not in your contacts, and allow you to listen in on any voice 
mail message as callers are leaving it, so that you can jump into the 
call if you like. Turn these features on at work for most or all of your 
personal callers; they will save you tons of time and allow you to stay 
focused.
	
✓	SMS text message forwarding, voicemail notifications, and transcrip­
tions; call recording. These features let you stay on top of your voice 
messages and recordings from your e-mail Inbox. You avoid the inter­
ruption of a phone call but still get important messages in a timely 
fashion. And you can forward or embed messages, notifications, and 
recordings for others to respond to or use for reference.
	
	When forwarding or embedding messages, always protect the caller’s 
privacy regarding anything confidential such as the caller’s phone 
number.
	
✓	Phone switching. On incoming calls, you can switch a call from one of 
your forwarding phones to another, just by pressing * during the call. All 
your forwarding phones then ring (which might cause a bit of consterna­
tion on the home front if your home phone rings briefly, then goes silent 
again). This is great if a call comes in on your cell phone at work and 
reception is iffy; you can transfer the call to your desk phone, as long as 
it’s not an extension.
	
✓	Customized greetings. You can personalize greetings to convey the 
right businesslike and/or friendly tone for work and personal calls. But 
you can also convey information, sometimes reducing the need for a 
“live” phone call.
	
	If you’re on your honeymoon, for example, you can use a customized 
greeting to tell business callers “I’ll be on personal leave during July. 
Please contact. . . .” On the other hand, you can create a different mes­
sage daily for friends to keep them up to date: “Honeymoon, Day 1: 
Wow!” Both dissuade people from ringing through to bother you, but in 
very different ways.

268
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
	
✓	Google mobile site and dialers. Whether you’re using the Google 
mobile site or a dialer app on a smartphone, as described in some depth 
in Part III, or Gmail on a cell phone to receive Google Voice notifications, 
you can manage both personal and work calls using your cell phone. 
You can do this on the move and in what would otherwise be down 
time. You can also do it during boring meetings, depending on the 
etiquette in place among you and your colleagues.
	
✓	Managing callers by group. The ability to use Google Voice to manage 
callers by group can be a great time saver, and work is where saving 
time often takes precedence over any other concern. So taking the 
time to set up caller groups properly can be a real bonus at work. (See 
Chapter 5 for details on setting up caller groups.)
Determining what doesn’t work so well
Google Voice at work doesn’t always work so well. Here are the most impor­
tant, in our book:
	
✓	What number to give? Should you give your Google Voice number out 
as a work number? Having carefully considered this, we can definitively 
answer: it depends. See the next two sections for more.
	
✓	What about traveling? A Google Voice number does not forward calls 
to phones that travel outside the country, which basically means that 
the receiving capability of your cell phone — half of what defines a 
telephone — stops working via your Google Voice number. Your boss 
or clients, for one, probably will not like this. You can call people, by 
making a long-distance call back to your Google Voice number in the 
U.S., but you can’t directly receive calls. This is often a blessing but in 
some cases a real problem; see Chapter 7 for the future prognosis and 
workarounds.
	
✓	Extension phones. Google Voice doesn’t work with extensions. It may 
or may not work if you have your own dedicated number, but one that’s 
routed through an office phone system; try it to find out. You may end 
up needing to request a direct line to your desk, as people used to have 
to do for fax machine or Internet access at work.
	
✓	Mixed messages. What feels to you like control, such as sending some 
people straight to voicemail or, in particular, using the ListenIn feature, 
can feel to others like rudeness. Follow the Golden Rule — do unto 
others as you would have them do unto you.
	
✓	Missed signals. All the options Google Voice gives you can make it pos­
sible to miss a truly important call. In the early days especially, be gen­
erous about letting calls through and picking up calls to avoid mistakes.

269
 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
	
✓	Geeking out. If others see you spending a lot of time managing Google 
Voice and don’t know about or understand the benefits you and your 
company are getting from it, it’s easy for them to question the useful­
ness of Google Voice, the usefulness of you, or both. This is a case 
where the other Golden Rule applies: them that have the gold make the 
rules. Be careful.
	
✓	Who calls whom? Conferencing, recording, and call switching to 
another phone all work only on calls coming in to you. Free national 
calls and very low international rates only apply on calls you place. 
When you make phone appointments, consider the logistics of who 
should call who.
	
✓	Managing home while away. Like e-mail and chain messages, GV might 
be restricted at your workplace.
Using Google Voice at 
work versus for work
Unless your organization expressly forbids it, you can and should use Google 
Voice at work. Used properly, it makes it easier to deal with a few urgent 
things from the rest of your life while at work, protecting the rest of your 
time and focus for doing the job.
Banned? Seriously?
You might have trouble imagining an organiza­
tion banning Google Voice use at work, but we’ll 
be surprised if it doesn’t happen in at least a 
few. We’ve both worked in large corporations 
that banned Gmail, Hotmail, YouTube, Skype, 
most instant messaging, and much more. To 
add insult to injury, they forced employees to 
use Lotus Notes as well. (A bit of a joke there, 
as many people hate Notes, a productivity 
package that went through a stretch of about 
a decade with minimal updating. Some others 
reportedly love it.)
In this organization, as in many others, PCs 
were locked down; users were not allowed to 
install any additional software, but had to make 
a request to the IT department, which might 
or might not carry it out. Even IT employees 
weren’t above the letter of the law.
This organization also gave cell phones out to 
most employees — BlackBerry phones, as is 
usually the case where security is a concern. 
These were “locked down” as well; employees 
could visit the Google mobile site, for example, 
but not install a dialer. Webmail was banned 
on the BlackBerry phones as well. Most 
employees brought a personal cell phone to 
stay in touch personally.

270
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
But what about using Google Voice for work? This boils down to two ques­
tions: Should you use Google Voice to make work calls where it makes sense, 
such as cheap international calls and cheap and convenient conference calls? 
And, the really important question from an organization’s point of view: 
Should you give out your Google Voice number for work purposes?
These seemingly simple questions fall into a category called governance, in 
which organizations try to operate according to carefully reviewed, internally 
agreed-on rules, despite the messy complexity of the real world. Corporate 
governance is a complicated but important topic that will have to stretch to 
accommodate Google Voice and similar offerings that may come out in the 
future.
Calling out on Google Voice can save your company a lot of money, and you 
a lot of hassle, as described above. But it also means people you call may see 
or capture your Google Voice number for contacting you in the future, which 
organizations that understand the issue probably don’t want.
Many organizations won’t worry too much about this, but other organiza­
tions will “just say no” and ask employees not to use Google Voice numbers 
for work at all.
With Google Voice having just been launched, it may take some organizations 
a while go come up with a policy covering it. If this is the case at your place 
of employment, and if the organization tends to be strict on these issues, 
we recommend that you do use Google Voice to save all involved money on 
outbound calls and occasionally for casual conference calls. But you should 
probably avoid having a Google Voice number printed on your business card, 
placed in official company directories, or otherwise used officially, unless 
your organization also allows personal cell phone numbers to be used in 
this way.
The bottom line is that many reasons exist for both your employer and you 
to embrace your use of Google Voice for work purposes, but some employers 
may ban it to at least some extent. If the employer provides you a cell phone 
and cell service, this is reasonable, if harsh; if they don’t, it seems unreason­
able, but it’s not worth getting fired over.
	
If your company is usually open to new technologies, it will probably evaluate 
Google Voice and make an informed policy decision that you can live with. If 
it tends to quash new technologies, well, you might want to keep your Google 
Voice account a secret so they don’t hassle you.

271
 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
Using Google Voice for Small Business
If you’re a small businessperson, a contractor, or entrepreneur, using Google 
Voice is a no-brainer. Google Voice’s features are ideally suited for helping 
you manage your bustling work and social life, and can help you save money 
on your phone bill.
Google Voice is so advantageous for individually-based businesses that you 
may want to consider moving to it even before inbound phone number porta­
bility is supported. (That is, before you can transfer your cell phone or busi­
ness number to Google Voice.) It’s a hassle to get everyone to change what 
number they call you on, but you only have to do it once, and you can benefit 
from the cost savings and features right away.
Instead of worrying about what number to call you on and when, your 
friends, family, and business contacts will be able to call you on one number, 
and for you to be able to manage the call in a way that works for both them 
and you.
Corporate employees may have another reason for entrepreneur envy; people 
in locked-down environments who are more or less prohibited from using 
Google Voice will wish they were you.
Competing for telecommunication dollars
What’s the future of Google Voice? Will this 
thing be around forever, or at least for a very 
long time?
Google Voice is one of the most important 
offerings ever from one of the most important 
technology companies around. You shouldn’t 
worry about investing time and effort in getting 
a Google Voice number and putting it to use.
You also have good reason to hope that Google 
Voice will not only survive, but thrive. Google 
owns the Android operating system for phones, 
and they have deals with major resellers such 
as Samsung and HTC. They have also pur­
chased billions of dollars in wireless spectrum 
rights.
The hope for any Google Voice user (who isn’t 
also a telecoms executive) is that Google will 
more or less become a telecoms company, a 
one-number clearing house for home, cell, and 
even business phones, tied into e-mail, chat, 
video, e-commerce, and more. And that they’ll 
offer all this for a tiny fraction of the prices 
people pay now.
An effort like this will make the existing tele­
coms providers raise their games consider­
ably, so that everyone, Google Voice user or 
not, benefits greatly. You are, by using Google 
Voice today, helping make a future like this one 
possible.

272
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
What if you have several employees and find yourself incurring significant 
phone bills, including running a small multiline phone system? You have two 
alternatives here. You can move to a completely Google Voice-controlled 
system, although the limit of six forwarding numbers can quickly chafe if you 
have more than two employees total.
	
If your business phone number has gained any currency at all with current 
and potential customers, employees, and others, consider waiting for inbound 
phone number portability before using that number for Google Voice. In this 
way you can keep your valuable phone number while gaining the features of 
Google Voice.
Another concern before forwarding your current number to Google Voice is 
to see how your current provider, or competitors, will support the need for 
another phone number to replace the one that you transfer for use by Google 
Voice.
Ooma, a provider of inexpensive VOIP-based phone systems for small busi­
ness, was the first to announce a Google Voice compatible system; the 
announcement is shown in Figure 16-3. This system has the effect of porting 
your existing phone number to Google Voice without your having to actually 
do so.
When users of the ooma system dial out, the call appears to be coming from 
your usual phone number, which gets all the benefits of Google Voice. The 
system includes landline handsets that send and receive SMS text messages. 
Ooma seems to have achieved a breakthrough, although they’re likely to 
have a lot of competition for your business in the months and years to come.

273
 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
Short of switching to ooma, you can use an alternative approach as an interim 
move while waiting for more options to appear, or possibly as a permanent 
approach. If you’re a small company with more than one or two employees and 
an investment in a widely used phone number and a phone system, you may 
want to consider integrated use of your current phone setup and Google Voice.
In this approach, the phone system and the old phone number remain. That 
gives a consistent experience for everyone you deal with. But you still use 
Google Voice by encouraging, or even requiring, your employees to use 
Google Voice where its capabilities are beneficial.
Every employee will be able to be reached by either the office number or 
Google Voice. Basically you’re formalizing and optimizing the use of cell 
phones by employees by incorporating Google Voice into the overall solu­
tion. Encourage employees to make international calls using Google Voice, 
and to provide their Google Voice number for incoming calls as well.
Using Google Voice has a few immediate advantages. It provides all employees 
with free national calling, which you may have already, and very cheap inter­
national calling, which you probably don’t have. It supports casual conference 
calls and recording of both conference calls and important one-on-one calls.
And it puts your employees in control, while keeping the official phone 
number in the mix.
There are half a dozen steps you can consider that will help you get the most 
out of a mixed approach with a main number at the core and Google Voice 
numbers for employees:
	
1.	Write it down. Write down how you want people to use the office phone 
number and Google Voice. Circulate the draft for review and gather input. 
The result is an improved solution that everyone can live with.
	
2.	Provide training. Organize classes on Google Voice and make sure 
everyone attends, just as you would with a new phone system. People 
will complain, but this is too important to leave to trial and error.
	
3.	Consider providing cell phones. You may want to provide cell phones — 
in particular, smart phones — to many or even all your employees. The 
cost will be far less with Google Voice handling formerly expensive 
international calls, and with a smart phone in particular, your employees 
will now have an easy way to keep on top of Google Voice phone calls 
and e-mailed notifications.
	
	 If an employer-provided cell phone threatens to overload your employ­
ees with one device too many, show them how to forward their personal 
cell phone number to the phone you’re providing. This keeps them “in 
the loop” with their personal lives and save them money.
	
4.	Consider including PC-based calling. Google Talk, Skype, and Gizmo5 
(see Chapter 15), support calls without tying up office phone lines or 
burning cell phone minutes.

274
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
	
5.	Cut out expensive calls. Keep a close eye on phone bills to make sure 
that expensive international calls from personal cell phones, home 
phones, and the office phone aren’t made anymore, and that inexpensive 
Google Voice calling is used instead.
	
6.	Traveling on business with Google Voice. When you go abroad, Google 
Voice will not be able to ring your cell phone, even if you have enabled 
worldwide service with your carrier. If you’re okay with sending all 
your calls to voicemail, then make sure you turn on e-mail notifications, 
so you can keep tabs on your messages from your computer or smart­
phone. (Beware of data roaming charges abroad; they’re steep.) If you 
don’t want to send all incoming calls routed through Google Voice to 
voice mail, have Google Voice point all calls to a domestic landline back 
home. Then call the phone company, and have your landline forwarded 
to your true cell phone number. Problem solved! Just remember to turn 
off your landline forwarding when you get home.
This approach has limitations, some of which you, with your own phone 
management to worry about, may feel keenly. A big concern is that only 
one Google Voice number can claim the main office number as a forwarding 
number for Google Voice. In most cases, it’s likely to be your Google Voice 
account that “claims” the main office number, preventing anyone else from 
doing so. (Sometimes it’s good to be king, or queen!)
	
You can use workaround for this problem that’s a bit hidden, but that almost 
everyone will find useful sometimes. It’s called temporary call forwarding and 
is described in Chapter 9. The Google Voice Help screen for temporary call 
forwarding is shown in Figure 16-4; you can visit it at www.google.com/
support/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=115084.
To use temporary call forwarding, call into your Google Voice number’s voice 
mail. Press 4 to access the main settings menu, then 4 again for temporary 
settings. Press 2 to set a temporary number and enter the number.
If you’re working in a small business setting and several of your company’s 
employees are abroad, they can use temporary forwarding to forward their 
Google Voice numbers to the main office line. The person attending the main 
phone can screen calls, handle routine requests, and put through anything 
truly urgent.
If you’re running a small business, you may want to have your employees 
keep their contacts in a centralized dossier, to prevent the loss of a customer 
should an employee leave. Doing this is easy with Google Sync, which wire­
lessly backs up an employee’s contacts from their mobile phone or PC to 
their Google contacts. This puts the same contacts on their mobile phones as 
it does in their Google applications like Gmail or Google Voice. Then you can 
quickly move to maintain relationships when an employee leaves, whether 
there’s a competitive concern or not.

The philosophy of work
Academics who study management largely 
agree that management in large organizations 
is primarily about two issues, referred to as 
functional simplification and closure. This can 
be translated as two exercises: Boiling complex 
situations down to simple questions, preferably 
with a “yes or no” answer; and agreeing on and 
enforcing simple answers to these questions.
Functional simplification and closure, consid­
ered together, form a complex process. Lots 
of things that large organizations do that seem 
incomprehensible or even stupid from outside 
suddenly make sense if you study the process 
by which decisions are reached.
Most of us like people who are optimistic and 
inclusive. Organizations are pessimistic and 
exclusive; the organization is defined as much 
by what it keeps out as by what it lets in. “No” is 
a very comfortable answer indeed for a senior 
IT manager.
The use of Web-based e-mail at work is a good 
example. Large organizations hate security 
breaches. Using functional simplification, an 
organization quickly determines that Web-
based e-mail is a ready source of security 
breaches. So closure is easy: no Web-based 
e-mail at work. Notice that the relative merits 
of productivity, individual freedom and attrac­
tiveness as an employer never got a look in: 
the functionally simple question was, does this 
practice cause security concerns?; closure 
was easily provided by the answer: no Webmail.
Similar concerns arise with Google Voice. 
Google Voice can be banned in an organization, 
to one degree or another, before its benefits are 
even considered. “If you don’t understand it, 
ban it” might be a simple way of describing the 
reason in many cases.

276
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
Google Voice provides small businesses with an opportunity to take advan­
tage of their ability to move quickly and immediately to start saving time, 
money, and effort with Google Voice. To get the most out of it requires a bit 
of structure, as described above, but the rewards are significant.
Using Google Voice in the Enterprise
If you work in a large organization that has to decide how to handle it, you 
may find that Google Voice is hard for very large organizations to swallow. 
It’s not just us saying this. Telecom TV, a telecommunications-focused Web 
site, hosted an article about Google Voice soon after it was announced. The 
headline, shown in Figure 16-5, says it all, albeit with a touch of hyperbole: 
“The killer weakness with Google Voice: Enterprises will never go for it.”
	
Figure 16-5: 
Never is a 
long time.
	
In some respects, that’s true; people in IT tend to be suspicious of Google’s 
free services and don’t like consumer tools of any sort coming into their 
closed shops.
The article’s headline is an overstatement in three ways, though:
	
✓	Enterprise problems are not a killer weakness. Even if enterprises 
never go for Google Voice, that’s only a killer weakness in the enterprise. 
Google Voice can become very successful, even if it’s only a winner 
among consumers and in small and medium-sized businesses.

277
 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
	
✓	Never is a long time. Google Voice offers truly impressive cost savings 
and great features that may be hard for others to duplicate. It can be 
made more enterprise-friendly, though Google has not shown much 
natural ability to do this with its other offerings. (Google Mail still being 
in beta five years after launch is the, well, killer example.)
	
✓	Google can win by proxy. Google can license key features to enterprise-
friendly competitors, profiting from “competing” products. Google can 
also partner with or buy other companies to help it get in the door. If 
not, it can just force the entire telecoms establishment to spend much 
of its time and energy trying to catch up in the enterprise while Google 
captures most of the other business.
We describe most of the concerns relating to Google Voice in the enterprise 
in the beginning of this chapter, from the perspective of the employee. 
Because Google is a tool for consumers, that’s the best way to look at it.
Based on this analysis and a bit of additional thinking, we can make a brief 
set of overarching recommendations for enterprises to begin dealing with 
Google Voice:
	
✓	Develop expertise. You should have at least a small group of Google 
Voice users inside your organization who you can tap into to under­
stand its plusses and minuses, both in general and as they apply to your 
company. This expertise is crucial, because many of your employees are 
likely to become accomplished Google Voice users, and will expect you 
to hold up your end of a conversation about it, from features to impli­
cations in your organization. A serious evaluation of Google Voice will 
stand you in good stead all around.
	
✓	Jawbone your suppliers on price. Google’s very low prices for inter­
national calls, shown in Table 7-2, are the new benchmark for what any 
organization should be paying. Note that these prices include calls from 
cell phones and are in some cases a tenth what other suppliers charge. 
Get your current suppliers and their competitors in and demand conver­
gence with the new “Google price” within months at best, a year or two 
at worst. If a supplier tries to tell you why they can’t do it, give them a 
one-word answer: “Next.”
	
✓	Jawbone your suppliers on features. Enterprise customers are hardly 
going to be in a hurry to get in touch with a new supplier like ooma, 
featured in the discussion on small business above. But Alcatel-Lucent 
is a reputable name in big-company telecoms, and they unveiled an 
answer to Google Voice in March 2009 at the CTIA trade show for wire­
less telephony, shortly after Google Voice was announced. A Web portal 
for management and conversion of voicemail to text were shown; a Web 
phone was promised. (See the diagram in Figure 16-6 to see the place of 
Rich Communications Manager in the enterprise.) Products based on 
this offering from carriers are expected soon.

278
Part IV: Playing Well with Others 
	
✓	Set a direction. “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will 
take you there,” said the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. Decide 
how you see your employees’ personal and work phone usage working 
in the future.
	
✓	Develop a policy. Develop a policy for Google Voice use in your orga­
nization. One sensible policy for many enterprise organizations would 
be as follows: allow people to forward Google Voice notifications to 
their work e-mail address; allow (or, optionally, encourage) people to 
use Google Voice to make international calls when not in the office; but 
don’t allow Google Voice numbers or personal cell phone numbers to be 
included on business cards or in company directories. (If you allow it for 
personal cell phones, you should allow it for Google Voice.)
	
✓	Sell the policy. “Because I said so” is not a very good answer to give 
today’s employees, especially the younger ones, many of whom have a 
particular concern about work-life balance and will rightly see Google 
Voice as a powerful tool for improving it. Reach out to active Google 
Voice users; get their input and explain your policy — even modify it, if 
appropriate — until everyone’s comfortable, if not necessarily in agree­
ment, with it.
Don’t be mistaken; at least some of your employees will see adopting Google 
Voice as a necessity. Some will be fans of Google in general, others just very 
impressed with what Google Voice does for them. They’re not likely to be 
very impressed, in turn, by anything less than a carefully thought through 
and well-communicated, yet rapid, response to Google Voice.

 Chapter 16: Using Google Voice for Business
If you do come up with a creative, yet solidly grounded approach, though, 
Google Voice has opened the door to a much less expensive and much more 
effective use of telephones in the future, whether your organization specifi­
cally adopts Google Voice or not.
Aiming to be enterprise-ready
Google has done very well to become per­
haps the top brand and one of the most highly 
valued companies on Earth without gaining the 
confidence of large businesses. Will this ever 
change?
One would have to guess that it won’t change 
soon. Google’s approach is to put everything 
into algorithms and to run those algorithms on 
vast, cheap server farms. Google is happy to 
pay — some would say, to pay over the odds — 
for talented people to invent, program, run, and, 
to a certain extent, market these products. But 
the company avoids paying for lots of people in 
sales and support.
Big business needs handholding, care, and 
customization; all the things that Google doesn’t 
do. It’s a bit like asking McDonald’s to create 
Michelin-starred food; it’s not what they do.
Even Google’s style, which endears it to many 
customers, is off-putting to big business. Big 
business doesn’t want a company’s logo to 
change every day; for products to be intro­
duced and withdrawn in dizzying succession; 
and, worst of all, for products to run for years 
with a beta designation and never be properly 
launched, nor to bear version numbers and other 
identifiers needed for management control.
Google aims its products at employees rather 
than employers. Using Google Voice in the 
enterprise requires a series of workarounds 
and compromises, and will do so for quite a 
while. Eventually, Google and its competitors 
will tame Google’s innovations and offer them 
in a form the enterprise can more easily accept 
and deploy internally.

Ten Points of Netiquette 
for Google Voice
In This Chapter
▶	Letting people know the benefits of Google Voice
▶	Being gentle when replying to a call by e-mail
▶	Getting permission before circulating recordings
▶	Knowing when not to use Google Voice
N
etiquette, etiquette for the Internet, became a popular topic in the 
1990s as millions of people used e-mail and online message boards for 
the first time.
When you’re playing with a new Web tool, expressing yourself too directly 
is very easy to do. For example, you might use all caps for emphasis, even 
though, to others, this comes across as impolite shouting.
Netiquette isn’t just for the benefit of others. We all want to be effective in 
communication. Communicating in a way that feels good to you but is off-
putting to the recipient isn’t really effective.
Google Voice has its own evolving etiquette, a mix of netiquette, phone eti­
quette, and specific rules that relate to Google Voice’s own specific functions. 
We offer our own guide here; use it as a starting point for developing your 
own approach to using Google Voice effectively.
Don’t Announce It’s Google Voice
The term Google Voice sounds quite robotic and even, for those who don’t 
know it well, a little scary. So tell people that you have a new number or that 
it’s your work number. Tell them that this number is the best way to reach 
you. (It will be, but only if and when you want to speak to them.) Don’t bother 
announcing to everyone the nuances of the system; if you do, they might 
stick to your old number out of confusion.

284
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Tighten the Noose Gradually
Much of the power of Google Voice is to restrict people’s ability to contact 
you. The temptation, when you first start using Google Voice, is to greatly 
restrict the number of calls you get right off the bat.
However, a tight regime will probably be obvious to people who are trying to 
call you, especially people who are used to being able to reach you directly. 
It will seem quite simple to them: they’re used to having two or three num­
bers to try for you and reaching you perhaps half the time. Then, one day, 
you ask them only to call you on a new, Google Voice number.
Perhaps they do and from that moment on, never reach you directly again. 
To them, Google Voice has caused frustration and inconvenience. It might 
even cause them embarrassment, as they realize all the trouble you have 
gone to to cut yourself off from their calls.
You may eventually realize that you’ve become too hard to reach and start 
letting more calls through. The damage may have already been done, though.
To avoid needless frustration to your callers, tighten Google Voice’s settings 
gradually. Don’t screen calls right away; making people announce themselves 
can feel hostile. Build up your contacts first so that few people are subject to 
screening if and when you do impose it.
Sell the Switch
When you switch to Google Voice, people may ask you why you switched. 
Answer people in terms of the benefits to them. The benefits to you might 
be neutral or even off-putting to others — deferring calls and reducing your 
time on the phone, for instance. The benefits to both sides include the fact 
that one incoming call can ring several of your numbers, giving them a better 
chance of reaching you. You don’t have to tell them you got Google Voice to 
screen calls.
Minimize Cell Use during Meetings
Whether to use your cell phone to send and receive text and e-mail messages 
during meetings is an active topic of discussion. The answer seems to be 
different for people depending on their age: younger people tend to see it as 
acceptable in more situations than older ones.

285
 Chapter 17: Ten Points of Netiquette for Google Voice
Google Voice makes the temptation to use your cell phone during meetings 
even greater. Without Google Voice, phone calls that come in during meet­
ings can create a crisis: you have to ignore the call or take it. If you take the 
call, you interrupt the meeting, so you tend to ignore calls.
With Google Voice, the phone call may ring through or be blocked, depending 
on the settings applying to the caller’s phone number. The bigger difference, 
though, is that you’ll soon receive a notification and, if a voicemail message 
was left, a transcript.
This gives you an opportunity to see approximately what was said and 
to respond by text, e-mail or, if the message seems important and urgent 
enough, by leaving the meeting to return the call.
Some meetings today begin with a request to turn cell phones off or to 
silence. With Google Voice, you can be tempted to spend several minutes 
changing settings instead.
Our recommendation is simple enough: when in Rome, do as the Romans do. 
Don’t use your cell if others aren’t using theirs. If there’s a possibility of a call 
or message you absolutely can’t miss, use Google Voice to modify your set­
tings to let only that call through.
Plan Calls around Google Voice
Plan calls around Google Voice. For example, if you want to record a call, 
plan for the call to begin with the other person calling you. The same applies 
if you want to use Google Voice to support a conference call. That way you 
don’t have to interrupt a meeting that began with you calling out to have the 
other party or parties call you.
Turn Off Phone Screening 
for Phone Meetings
Make sure that phone screening is turned off for scheduled meetings. A call 
for a meeting may come from a previously unknown number, so turn phone 
screening off for all callers before the meeting. That way the person you have 
invited to contact you won’t have to announce themselves in order to do it.

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Move Calls from Skype to Google Voice
When arranging calls, especially international calls, you may encounter 
people who prefer to use Skype, because it’s long been the best way to carry 
out such calls at low cost. You will, however, want to use your Google Voice 
number to get the other person familiar with using your GV number, to take 
advantage of call recording and conferencing, and so on.
Among the reasons for moving to Google Voice that are the most convincing 
to others, and that you should therefore use, are that the Google Voice call 
is less likely to suffer drop-outs, and voice quality is likely to be better. (This 
is true because Google Voice is not voice over IP, which tends to suffer such 
problems. If you want to get technical, it’s a switching layer over regular tele­
phone service.)
	
Don’t put down Skype as you urge people to use Google Voice for calls. 
There’s no reason to offend people who have probably received great benefit 
from Skype. And don’t forget that, when you travel overseas and your Google 
Voice number stops working, you’ll probably be using Skype yourself.
Smooth the Transition to E-Mail
You may find yourself using Google Voice to reply to an incoming phone call 
via e-mail. Smooth the transition by being explicit about the change. Begin 
your e-mail with words somewhat like these: “I got your voicemail, and here’s 
what I think. . . .” This kind of introduction acknowledges how you were con­
tacted and tacitly moves the discussion forward in the different medium.
Get Permission for Recordings
Most people aren’t used to having their calls recorded, nor to having those 
recordings make their way around a workgroup, a company — or the world.
Ask for permission before making a recording, before distributing it by e-mail 
to a small group, and before making it available, by e-mail or on the Web, to 
a larger group. If the material is at all sensitive, ask by e-mail, so you have 
a record of the participants’ agreement (or, if there’s no response, of their 
failure to object). Provide a link to the version you plan to publicize, and con­
sider making a transcript so participants can quickly scan the content rather 
than having to listen to all of it.

287
 Chapter 17: Ten Points of Netiquette for Google Voice
Know When Not to Use Google Voice
Google Voice is not always the answer. Trying to connect with someone at a 
crowded conference, you may want to communicate cell to cell for quicker 
reception of texts, for example. Google Voice is convenient, but a little cum­
bersome when you’re in a hurry, so those “where are you?” calls with close 
contacts may be better handled directly.

Ten Online Resources 
for Google Voice
In This Chapter
▶	gvDaily.com
▶	Google Voice online support
S
ometimes the obvious thing isn’t easy, and sometimes the easy thing 
isn’t obvious.
However, finding ten worthwhile online resources for Google Voice is both 
easy and, obviously, a good thing for us to provide. Google Voice is fast, 
changing, and deep; there is always news and always more to know about the 
parts of Google Voice you thought you were familiar with.
You may want to bookmark all of these resources plus, perhaps, another ten 
or so for using Google Voice and other time- and money-saving resources 
on your specific type of cell phone. With that kind of line-up, you’ll be well-
informed and always learning new things to get the most out of Google Voice 
and your phones.
Without further ado, here we provide ten must-have online resources for 
Google Voice. Cleverly, or perhaps cruelly, the tenth one opens the door to 
dozens more resources that you may wish to keep an eye on as well.
gvDaily.com
Google Voice Daily (gvDaily, for short) is the Google Voice blog edited by one 
of the authors of this book, Bud Smith. Google Voice Daily is the first regularly 
published blog devoted exclusively to Google Voice. Its intent is to keep you up 
to date on news items and announcements for Google Voice, what they mean 
and how to use them. Google Voice Daily will also include extensions to the 
book to cover new features that come out after our publication date.

290
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The blog includes a section, “get Google Voice,” which is not just an encour­
agement to actually get a Google Voice phone number and start using it. The 
section’s name is also an encouragement to really understand Google Voice, 
to “get” it in the sense of understanding it, of grokking it, to use an old sci­
ence fiction term (from Robert Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land). You 
could also say in the sense of taking the red pill, to use a newer one (from 
The Matrix). Now we’ll toddle off to dream of a few electric sheep.
Google Voice Online Support
It may seem strange to say in a book about Google Voice, but we found the 
online support for Google Voice to be quite useful. The clean and attractive inter­
face of Google Voice seems to be matched by an easy-to-use online help system.
However, it’s good to be clear about what the online support does. It offers a 
brief take on what Google Voice does. It doesn’t tackle how to do more com­
plex tasks or why things are done the way they are.
We found ourselves having to go to a variety of resources, including exten­
sive experimentation over years of experience and asking questions directly 
of the Google Voice development team, to get into the underlying details.
The online help also lacks a big picture perspective. You won’t find much 
there about how the top level of Google Voice settings interacts with group-
level settings, then with settings per contact, and how all that interacts with 
the Google Voice Mobile site. 
Google Voice Support Site
It’s useful to get into Google Voice support by clicking Help from a given 
screen within the Google Voice Web site, but to get a broader view you may 
want to go directly to the Google Voice support site. The Web address is:
www.google.com/support/voice
From here you can search specifically within Google Voice online support 
and link from one topic to another.
If you’re in a hurry and want a quick answer without going into the Google 
Voice Web site in general or the Google Voice support site in particular, try 
using regular Google Search, but add the following to the search:
site:google.com

This restricts your answers to those from the google.com Web site. You find 
most of the hits come from the Google Voice support site.
Official Google Voice Blog
If you’ve taken the trouble to start using Google Voice and to acquire this 
book, you’re off to a good start in developing expertise with Google Voice. 
An important step in maintaining your expertise is to follow the official 
Google Voice blog. (You can also do this indirectly by using a Google Alert, as 
described in resource 10 below.)
You can visit the official Google Voice blog via a link from the support site, 
above, or by visiting:
http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/
After you arrive at the blog, you can read past entries and use one of the but­
tons to subscribe to the site. It won’t overwhelm you; in the first four months 
after Google Voice was announced, a very busy time in the product’s history, 
there were only ten entries. All the more reason why you may feel the need to 
know soon on those rare occasions when a posting actually is made to the blog.
Craig Walker on Twitter
Craig Walker is one of the key founders of GrandCentral, precursor to Google 
Voice. He’s now Group Product Manager for the Real Time Communications 
group at Google, an area of the company that includes Google Voice.
You may be an active Twitter user or wonder what all the fuss is about. Now 
you have a(nother?) reason to use it. Craig Walker keeps up an active pres­
ence on Twitter as cwalker123; follow him on Twitter to keep up with news 
and various events around Google Voice, everything from major product 
announcements to reviews to tech support issues.
YouTube
Google is making increasing use of video to demonstrate and support its 
products, and Google Voice is very much part of this. Google products are 
also popular subjects of videos others make. There isn’t, unfortunately, an 
official Google Voice YouTube channel, as there are for some other prod­
ucts. However, you can learn a lot by searching on the term Google Voice in 
YouTube.

Lifehacker
Lifehacker is a very good how-to site for a wide variety of tech and non-tech 
issues. (Of six recent featured articles, five were about technology; the sixth 
was “Make Reverse-Engineered Kentucky Fried Chicken at Home.”) Lifehacker 
has been very much on top of Google Voice and provides great tips and 
tricks on how to use it. This site is a great online complement to this book. 
Visit Lifehacker and look up Google Voice; you’re bound to find something 
interesting.
TechCrunch
TechCrunch is a great source for tech news and views and has been a con­
sistent, “fastest with the mostest” resource for Google Voice. TechCrunch 
articles also get a lot of comments, some quite interesting and useful.

Ten Key Google Voice 
Features for Business
In This Chapter
▶	Making less expensive calls
▶	Using calling features for free
I
n mid-2009, the city of Los Angeles announced that it was considering 
using Google Apps for many of its core computing needs.
This announcement represented a watershed in the use of hosted applica­
tions in general and Google tools in particular. In the past, organizations 
could be seen as irresponsible if they adopted a Google-hosted solution, due 
to concerns about privacy and security.
With Los Angeles’ move, an organization could now equally be seen as irre­
sponsible for wasting taxpayer, shareholder, donor or other money on tradi­
tional approaches that demand extensive in-house IT resources.
And it’s not just money. Managing IT takes up huge amounts of management 
time and attention. Yet few companies or other organizations are going to 
gain real competitive advantage or other breakthroughs in carrying out their 
core missions by delivering basic IT services better than their peer group.
With Los Angeles’ move, Google took a big step toward making this an 
accepted viewpoint. If Los Angeles can get a substantial part of its needs met 
through Google-based services, few organizations can dismiss such solutions 
offhand.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Organizations now need to consider Google-based and competing solutions 
in all areas of data processing and, yes, telecommunications. 
Google Voice is a point solution that can work with existing systems, and it 
offers tremendous savings in cost and greatly increased convenience. 
Following are ten advantages of using Google Voice in business that every 
organization should consider in deciding whether and how to adopt it.
Cheaper Calls
Business can’t ignore the reduced cost of calls on Google Voice. It’s worth 
taking a sampling of domestic and international calls and comparing what 
they actually cost your business with what the costs would have been using 
Google Voice.
Some related costs are worth paying attention to as well. With a work-
supplied Google Voice number, employees will be more likely to make and 
receive calls when and where needed, rather than avoiding a big cost for the 
company or an embarrassingly large expense submission. The phone does 
more of what companies are paying for when they take on the expense of 
buying and maintaining them.
Free Conference Calls
Many calls would benefit from having another person or two included, but it 
can be quite difficult and expensive to set up conference calls. Google Voice 
makes casual conferencing easy and free.
Businesses can look at both the savings on conferencing costs and the 
business benefits of more conference calls being made because doing so 
becomes easy and free. This means more collaboration with no additional 
costs, including not only conferencing costs but also travel costs.

297
 Chapter 19: Ten Key Google Voice Features for Business
Free Call Recording and Sharing
Better record keeping is important for businesses, and so is greater collabo­
ration. Having the ability to record calls for free improves record-keeping, 
and the calls can then be shared, improving collaboration.
E-Mail Notifications and Transcripts
Many company employees spend a good deal of time scanning their smart­
phones and PCs for incoming e-mails and dealing with them, yet dread the 
voicemail queue that can accumulate after a single meeting, let alone a day 
away from the office.
Google Voice sends notifications, with attached transcripts and links to 
the call, by e-mail. This allows e-mail scanning to do double duty, alerting 
employees to important voice mail messages as well as important e-mail mes­
sages. Voice messages get handled more quickly, improving responsiveness 
to colleagues and customers, yet also more easily, making employees who 
receive calls more productive.
Free Text Messaging with Records
Google Voice puts the text message Inbox on the computer, integrated 
with the voicemail Inbox. This improves record keeping and the ability to 
respond to text messages flexibly, including forwarding them easily to mul­
tiple people, and with one eye on relevant e-mails or other information where 
needed.
Contacts Integration
Google Voice makes it easy to integrate contacts using Google contacts or 
spreadsheet files. This makes it easier to create and maintain shared lists of 
contacts within a company, eliminating a major hassle for all employees.

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
One Number to Ring Them All
Everyone who’s ever worked in business has probably had the experience of 
getting a call on their mobile phone, ignoring it, only to have the same person 
call second later on their office phone (or vice versa). Persistent callers may 
go on to try receptionists, secretaries, colleagues, even someone’s boss to 
try to reach them.
Google Voice’s “one number to ring them all” feature is not only convenient 
for recipients; callers only have one number, so know that the person will get 
their message and respond as fast as they’re able.
Variable Greetings
Employees can treat callers better with variable greetings. A greeting can 
even be used to convey crucial information, such as when the person will 
become free and be able to respond — again, improving responsiveness 
while reducing anxiety for all confirmed.
Switchboard Functionality
We’ve all been in the position of answering the phone quickly because we’re 
waiting for one particular call, and being disappointed — perhaps again and 
again. The ability of a Google Voice user to put calls where they need to go 
is a big advantage for business. Personal and business calls can be managed 
closely — put off when needed, allowed through where they’re urgent. The 
ability to know that a critical call can be allowed through — with the non-
critical ones fended off — actually increases people’s ability to concentrate 
on business in the meantime.
Cell Phone Apps and Mobile Site
Companies make big investments in cell phones for employees. Often, much 
of the purpose is to allow on-the-go e-mail access through the same hardware 
and connections as phone calls. Google Voice’s apps (for BlackBerry and 
Android) and mobile site (for iPhone and other phones) take this integration 
to another level, making employees that much more efficient.
