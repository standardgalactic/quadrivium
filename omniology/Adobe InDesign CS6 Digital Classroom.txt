reset your workspace at the start of each lesson. To reset your workspace, choose 
Window > Workspace > Typography. The selected workspace determines which menu 
items display, which panels display, and which options display within the panels. If menu 
items that are identifi ed in the book are not displaying, choose Show All Menu Items from 
the menu in which you are working to locate them, or choose Window > Workspace >

InDesign documents
• Importing text and images
• Using styles to quickly 
format text and objects
Lesson 1
This lesson gets you started with InDesign CS6, covering essential 
skills necessary for working effi  ciently with InDesign documents. 
It provides a high-level overview of key concepts associated with 
creating layouts using InDesign. You’ll work with an existing 
document to understand how to navigate, place graphics, and add 
formatting to text, creating a fi nished newsletter that can be printed 
or distributed as a digital document. 
Starting up
Before you begin, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting 
your preferences. (For more information, see “Resetting the InDesign workspace and 
preferences” in the Starting up section of this book.)
In this lesson, you will work with several fi les from the id01lessons folder. Make sure that 
you have copied the id01lessons folder onto your hard drive from the DVD. For more 
information, see “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. If you are 
completely new to InDesign and don’t have much computer experience, it may be easier to 
follow the lesson if the id01lessons folder is placed on the desktop of your computer. This

then examine individual capabilities and features in more details in each of the remaining 
lessons. It may be helpful to view this lesson as a broad survey, providing you with a 
general understanding of the InDesign landscape, while the remaining lessons provide 
much more detail about specifi c InDesign capabilities.
See Lesson 1 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
InDesign tools
You’ll use InDesign’s tools for creating or modifying everything that appears in your 
documents, including text, images, and multimedia elements for digital documents. You’ll 
also use InDesign’s tools for navigating around the document. All tools are found in the 
Tools panel, located along the left side of your screen.
Many tools displayed in the tools panel have related tools that provide additional 
functionality, and you can select these related tools by clicking and holding the tool that is 
displayed in the tools panel. You can identify the tools with additional functionality by the 
small arrow in the lower-right corner. You can also right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click

Use the InDesign CS6 Tools panel to create objects, make selections, and modify objects and pages.
The InDesign workspace
InDesign documents are displayed in the center of the work area, while panels that let you 
control objects or perform specifi c tasks are displayed along the right side of the workspace 
in the panel docking area. InDesign uses many panels, and many are critical for editing 
and design work you perform. InDesign includes various workspaces that provide easy 
access to the panels and tools you’ll use for specifi c tasks. Let’s take a closer look at the 
InDesign workspace, including the document window and panels.
The document window
InDesign pages are displayed within a black border. Anything positioned within this area 
appears when the page is fi nished. The area outside of the black border is referred to as the 
pasteboard. Anything that is placed completely outside this black border on the pasteboard 
is generally not visible when the fi nal document is distributed.

You can use the pasteboard to temporarily hold elements while designing your project. 
You can move design elements such as images from the pasteboard to the page, trying 
diff erent layout variations. The pasteboard can also be useful for placing notes to 
colleagues—or even yourself—regarding the project. To get a better understanding of the 
InDesign workspace, you’ll open up the completed project, reset the workspace, and look 
at the work area.
1 
Choose File > Open. In the Open a File dialog box, navigate to the id01lessons folder 
and select the id01_done.indd fi le. Click Open. 
2 
Choose Window > Workspace > Typography. Panels containing controls that help 
you work with type are now displayed. 
You can also use the dedicated Workspace switcher to switch to a specifi c workspace. The 
Workspace switcher is located in the Application bar above the Control panel. The Workspace 
switcher displays the name of the current workspace and can also be used to change between 
workspaces or to reset the current workspace. The selected workspace determines which panels 
display and which menu items are available. The number of available panels and menu choices is 
based upon the selected workspace.
The workspace switcher makes it easy to display 
specifi c panels and menus depending upon 
your needs.

Using guides
Non-printing guides help you align content on your page and create an organized layout. 
There are several types of guides, but the essential guides for starting to work with 
InDesign are margin guides and ruler guides. Margin guides defi ne the space around the 
edge of your document—a space you generally want to keep free from objects. White 
space around the edge of your document creates good design, and also eliminates the risk 
of content being cut off  if your document is printed and trimmed to a specifi c size at a 
printing plant. Margin guides are displayed in magenta by default, immediately inside the 
page border. By default, they display one-half inch inside of the page edge, but you can 
adjust them, as you will learn in Lesson 2, “Building Documents with Master Pages.”
Ruler guides are the other type of guide you may want to add to your document layout. 
Ruler guides are created manually by dragging them from the rulers onto the page. Both 
ruler guides and margin guides are useful, but they can also be distracting when you want 
to see the elements of your page design. In this case, you can hide the guides.

Choose View > Grids & Guides > Hide Guides, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+; 
(Windows) or Command+; (Mac OS), to hide all the guides in the open document.
2 
Choose View > Grids & Guides > Show Guides, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+; 
(Windows) or Command+; (Mac OS), to show all the guides in the open document.
3 
You can show or hide guides by toggling back and forth using these commands.
Another type of guide is the liquid guide, which is used to help adjust the layout of 
an InDesign page when it is displayed as a digital document. Liquid Guides are a 
more advanced topic and are covered in the Creating Digital Documents lesson of the 
InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom book.
Viewing modes
You can use viewing modes to hide guides and other items that will not display when the 
fi nal document is printed or distributed. This provides a fast-and-easy way to preview 
your document. You can even turn your document into a presentation.
The viewing modes option lets you choose whether all content and guides display on your 
monitor, or whether InDesign displays only content that is positioned on the page and will 
print. Here you will explore the various viewing modes.
1 
At the bottom of the Tools panel, click and hold the Mode button ( ), and choose 
Preview from the available modes. Notice that the entire pasteboard appears gray and 
all elements located on the pasteboard are hidden. The borders do not display around 
any items on the page if they are not selected.
Click the display mode button at the bottom of the Tools panel 
to change how a page is displayed using InDesign.
2 
Click and hold the Mode button again and choose Bleed from the menu. This 
shows the allowable bleed area that was specifi ed when the document was created. 
Bleed is an area outside of the page that is intentionally used by designers so that any 
inaccuracies in the cutting, trimming, and binding process do not create a visible 
white space along the edge of an object that is intended to print all the way to the 
edge of a document. This mode is useful when you need to make sure that all the 
elements on your page extend to a specifi c bleed value. In this document, the bleed is 
set to 1/8 inch, which is a standard bleed value in the printing industry.

Click and hold the Mode button again and choose Presentation from the menu. This 
mode presents your document on a black background with no distracting interface 
elements. This is great for viewing your document or showing it to a client. When 
in this mode, you can navigate through the pages of your document by using the up 
and down or left- and right-arrow keys on your keyboard. To exit Presentation mode, 
simply press the Escape key on your keyboard.
4 
Click and hold the Mode button again and choose Normal.
You can also use the shortcut key W on your keyboard to switch between Preview and Normal 
modes, and Shift+W to activate Presentation mode, or you can use the Screen Mode button in 
the Application bar. Keep in mind that keyboard shortcuts do not work if you are using the Type 
tool and working with text inside a text frame. 
Working with panels
Another important part of the InDesign workspace are the panels used to modify and 
create objects. You can access panels by clicking on their name in the panel docking area, 
or choose the panel you want to access from the Window menu.
The Tools panel
The Tools panel is located on the left side of your screen and contains all the tools 
necessary to draw, add, or edit type, and edit items in your document. The Tools panel 
appears as a single column attached to the left side of your screen. You can modify the 
appearance and location of the Tools panel to accommodate your needs.

Click on the double-arrow icon (
) at the top of the Tools panel. The Tools panel 
changes from a single column to a double column. If the Tools panel is not docked, 
you have a third option when you click the double-arrow; it changes to a horizontal 
layout, then to a single column, and then a double column each time you click. Go to 
step 2 to learn how to dock and undock panels in InDesign.
Clicking on the Double-arrow icon at the top of the Tools panel changes its appearance between a one-column, two-column, 
or horizontal layout.
2 
Click the gray bar at the top of the Tools panel, and while holding down the mouse 
button, drag the panel to the right, into the document area. Release the mouse button 
when over the document area. The Tools panel is repositioned as a free-fl oating panel at 
the location where you released the mouse button. You can position the panel anywhere 
on your display, or return it to the docking area on the side of the workspace.

Click the gray bar at the top of the Tools panel and drag the panel to the right so that 
it is positioned just to the left of the panels. A blue, vertical bar appears. Release the 
mouse button, and the Tools panel is docked to the right of your screen. If you have 
trouble moving the panel by clicking on the gray bar, click on the dotted area just 
below the gray bar at the top of the Tools panel to reposition and dock the panel.
The tools panel can be docked along either the left or the right 
side of the InDesign workspace by dragging it into position 
using the gray dotted line near the top of the panel. Here the 
tools panel has been docked along the right side of the workspace.
Managing panels
InDesign’s panels are essential for your design work. They help you create new objects, 
edit existing objects, and work more effi  ciently as you design your documents. The various 
workspaces include diff erent panels that are docked at the right side of the document 
window. The available panels change based upon the selected workspace. You can add 
panels to the workspace as you need them, or remove panels. When the panels display 
only their name or icon, they are in collapsed mode. Collapsed mode saves screen space 
by providing you with easy access to many panels, and only displaying the full panel when 
you need to access all the controls. Here you will work with the various display modes 
available for panels.

Click and drag the Pages button, moving it to the far-left side of the document 
window. When a vertical bar appears, release the mouse button. The Pages panel is 
docked to the left side of the document window.
You can place panels anywhere on your workspace, including over the document or 
on either side of the work area. You may customize panels in any way that makes 
it easier for you to work. Keep the panel in this location, as you will work with 
customizing workspaces in the next exercise.

Working with panels
Saving your workspace
Once you have selected the panels that you need, and positioned them in the locations 
that let you work most effi  ciently, you can save the location of the panels being used as a 
workspace.
Once you have saved a workspace, you can quickly access the exact panels displayed and 
their location by returning to the default setup of that workspace.
1 
From the Workspace drop-down menu, located in the Application bar to the left of 
the Help search text fi eld, choose New Workspace.
Choose New Workspace to save the panels you 
are using and their location in the workspace.
2 
In the New Workspace window, type My Workspace in the Name text fi eld, and 
then click OK, leaving all the settings at their defaults.
Saving your workspace allows you to easily restore the panel positions.
You’ve now saved the locations of your panels.
3 
From the Workspace switcher drop-down menu, choose Typography. Then click on 
the Workspace switcher drop-down menu again and choose Reset Typography. Note 
how the panels revert to their default locations.
4 
From the Workspace switcher drop-down menu, choose My Workspace. Alternatively, 
choose Window > Workspace > My Workspace. All the panels are restored to their 
location that was part of the workspace you saved earlier in this project.

You can create and save multiple workspaces. Workspaces are not document-specifi c, 
and you can use them in any document. Before proceeding to the next section, reset 
your workspace to the default Typography workspace using the Workspace switcher 
drop-down menu. This allows the panels to match the descriptions used in the 
remainder of this lesson. If necessary, you can also choose Reset Typography from the 
Workspace switcher drop-down menu to reset the workspace to its default appearance.
Working with the Control panel
The Control panel appears across the top of the workspace. The panel is contextual, so the 
content of the panel changes depending on what tool you are using and what object you 
have selected.
1 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. The Control panel changes based 
upon the tool being used and the items selected in the layout. 
2 
Using the Selection tool, click the headline, Fending off  the winter blues, positioned at 
the top of the page. The Control panel now displays information about this text frame.
3 
Double-click the same headline. When you double-click the text frame, the Selection 
tool switches to the Text tool. The Control panel now displays information relating to 
the text.
The Control panel displays information about objects in your layout. The information displayed changes based upon the tool 
used for selection and the object selected. The icons displayed in the Control panel on your computer may diff er slightly based 
on the resolution of your computer’s display.
Navigating through an InDesign document
In this exercise, you’ll continue working with the id01_done.indd fi le, which is the 
completed newsletter that you opened at the beginning of the lesson. You’ll explore the 
tools used to navigate to diff erent pages in an InDesign document, and how to change the 
document’s magnifi cation to see more or fewer details in the document layout.
Using the Pages panel
The Pages panel provides a quick overview of the contents of each page in an InDesign 
document. You can use it to navigate between document pages, rearrange pages, and 
also add or remove pages. You can also use it to create transitions between pages that 
are distributed as electronic documents, and create page variations such as portrait and 
landscape variations for use on a tablet.

Double-click page 4 in the Pages panel to display page 4 of your document.
If you are unable to see all the pages displayed in the Pages panel, you can make the panel larger 
by clicking and dragging on the bottom-right corner of the panel. You can also scroll through the 
pages in the Pages panel by using the scroll bar along the right side of the panel or the scroll wheel 
on your mouse. 
Use the Pages panel to navigate to 
the diff erent pages in your document.
Changing the magnification of your document
You may want to get a closer look at parts of your document to align objects, check the 
spacing of type, or position of items in your layout. InDesign makes it easy to change the 
magnifi cation so you can zoom-in on parts of your document, or zoom out to get a birds-
eye view of your layout.
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click on the page 1 icon to display the fi rst page of the 
document.
2 
Select the Zoom tool ( ). Using the Zoom tool, click and hold in the upper-left corner 
of the Spinnews logo at the top of the page, and then drag down to the lower-right 
corner of the logo. Release the mouse once you have reached the lower-right corner 
of the logo. The area you have selected with the Zoom tool is magnifi ed.

Lesson 1, InDesign CS6 Essential Skills
Navigating through an InDesign document
You may fi nd that you enlarged the document either too much or not enough. To 
fi ne-tune the magnifi cation, click with the Zoom tool to increase the magnifi cation 
incrementally. Or, if you zoomed in too close, decrease the magnifi cation by pressing and 
holding the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key while clicking with the Zoom tool.
Click and drag to increase the magnifi cation of a specifi c area.
You can also increase or decrease the magnifi cation of the document by using the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl+plus sign (Windows) or Command+plus sign (Mac OS) to zoom in on a 
document, or Ctrl+minus sign (Windows) or Command+minus sign (Mac OS) to zoom out. 
If you have an object selected or your cursor is inserted within a text frame when using these key 
commands, the page will center on the selected object or cursor when changing the magnifi cation.
3 
Select the Hand tool ( ) from the Tools panel, and then click and hold down on the 
page in the document window. The page magnifi cation changes and a red frame 
appears, indicating which portion of the document will be visible when you fi nish 
scrolling.
4 
Use the Hand tool to arrange the page so that the logo is in the center of your 
document window. The Hand tool is used to move pages within the document 
window, allowing you to focus on specifi c areas of the layout.
5 
Press and hold the page in the document window. Position the red frame so the entire 
border of the image is visible, and then release the mouse. The zoom returns to its 
original level, focused on the part of the page you identifi ed using the Hand tool.
You can access the Hand tool temporarily by pressing and holding the spacebar on your keyboard 
when using any tool except the Type tool. When the spacebar is pressed, the cursor changes to 
the Hand tool. If you have the Type tool selected, press and hold the Alt (Windows) or Option

Working with type
You have signifi cant control over the appearance, formatting, and placement of type, 
and you can save formatting attributes to easily reapply them to other text so you can 
work effi  ciently while maintaining a consistent appearance across your documents. In 
this section, you’ll add the fi nishing touches to a document, completing the layout and 
applying formatting to text.
Entering and formatting type
When you add text to an InDesign layout, you will almost always place it inside a frame. 
Frames are containers that hold text, but they can also hold graphics or may even be used 
to hold nothing but a color, such as a shape in a design or a background color. In this 
exercise, you’ll be working with text frames.
1 
Choose File > Open a File. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the id01lessons 
folder and select the id01.indd fi le. Click Open. You will use this project fi le for the 
remainder of the lesson.

Type Fending off  the winter blues with cross-training in the text frame you 
created in the previous step. The text appears in the default font and size. Keep the 
cursor within this text frame, and keep the Type tool selected.
6 
In the panel docking area along the right side of the workspace, click the Paragraph 
Styles button ( ) to open the Paragraph Styles panel. Click to select the Heading style 
from the list of available styles in the Paragraph Styles panel. The Heading style is 
applied to the paragraph, which includes all the text within this frame. This saved style 
includes a variety of formatting attributes including font, style, and size. You’ll learn to 
create your own paragraph styles in Lesson 4, “Working with Styles.”
Paragraph styles make it easy to save and reapply multiple formatting attributes to text.

Placing and formatting type
You can add text to an InDesign document by typing text onto the InDesign page, or by 
importing the text from an external fi le, such as a Microsoft Word document or an Excel 
spreadsheet. You can import most major text fi le formats into an InDesign layout.
1 
If you’ve closed the Page panel, press the Pages button ( ) in the panel dock to open 
the Pages panel. Double-click page 2 in the Pages panel. If the Pages panel is covering 
your work area, click the double-arrows in the upper-right corner of the panel to 
reduce it to a button, or reposition it so you can see the document page.
2 
Continuing to use the Type tool ( ), click inside the empty text frame that covers the 
center and right columns, under the headline Caring for Those Wheels. The cursor is 
inserted into the frame. Next you will import text into your layout that was created 
using word processing software such as Microsoft Word, and saved as a plain .txt fi le.
You can import a variety of fi le types into your InDesign layouts. While this example uses a text 
fi le, the format could be a native Microsoft Word or even Microsoft Excel fi le, along with many 
other fi le formats.
3 
Choose File > Place. The Place dialog box opens. In the Place dialog box, make 
certain that Show Import Options is not selected and that Replace Selected Item is 
selected. These options are explained in more detail in Lesson 3, “Working with Text 
and Type.”
Navigate to the id01lessons folder provided with this book then locate and open the 
Links folder within the id01lessons folder. Choose the fi le Wheels.txt; then click 
Open. The text from this fi le is placed inside your text frame where you had placed 
the cursor. The text is formatted using InDesign’s Basic Paragraph style. Next you will 
apply a paragraph style to format the text you imported.

indicates that there is more text in the story than fi ts within this text frame. You will 
link this text to another frame so it continues in another location. 
The newly placed text on the page doesn’t fi t into the text frame. 
InDesign labels this as overset text, displaying a red plus symbol 
to identify it.
5 
Using the Selection tool click once on the red plus sign in the lower-right corner of 
the text frame. After you click the red plus sign, the cursor changes, indicating that 
you are about to link the text so it continues in a new location. Some of the text to be 
linked is displayed in the cursor. You will use the cursor to indicate where the story 
continues.

Lesson 1, InDesign CS6 Essential Skills
Using styles
Using styles
Earlier in this lesson, you formatted text by applying a paragraph style. You can use styles to 
easily and consistently format paragraphs, individual words or letters, as well as entire text 
frames and tables. Here you will apply styles to both paragraphs and individual characters. 
You’ll get a more detailed look at creating and using styles in Lesson 4, “Working with Styles”. 
Applying paragraph styles
Paragraph styles are applied to all the text between two paragraph returns. Whether several 
sentences or an individual word, InDesign applies styles to the text between two paragraph 
returns that were entered by using the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on the 
keyboard when the text was entered, even if the paragraph consists of only a single word.
1 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel, then on the left side of page 3, click 
anywhere inside the word January located in the fi rst line of the frame on the left side 
of the page.
2 
In the Paragraph Styles panel, choose Calendar Month to apply the correct formatting 
to the word January. Repeat the process to format the words February, and then March 
to format these words using the same paragraph style. Because these words have a 
keyboard return before and after them, they are considered to be a paragraph for the 
purpose of applying styles.
3 
Using the Type tool, click and drag to select the text located between the January and 
February headings, then click the Calendar Event style in the Paragraph Styles panel. 
Repeat this process to select all the text between February and March, and also all the 
March events, applying the Calendar Event style to this text.
Format the text using the Calendar Event style 
from the Paragraph Styles panel.
Notice that the Calendar Event style applies several attributes to the events in a single 
click, styling the date bold, the name red, and the web address in italic. The Calendar 
Event style includes several styles that are grouped together into what InDesign refers 
to as a nested style. A nested style applies several formatting attributes to text within 
a paragraph in a sequence you can defi ne. You will learn more about nested styles in 
InDesign Lesson 4, “Working with Styles.”

Applying character styles
You can also apply styles to individual words or characters within a group of type, 
formatting only the type you want to change. For example, you can apply common 
formatting attributes such as bold and italic. Character styles are the foundation for the 
nested styles that you applied to the event listings in the previous step. Here you will apply 
a character style to individual words.
1 
Double-click on page 2 in the Pages panel to display page 2 within the workspace.

Using the Zoom tool ( ), increase the magnifi cation so you can easily see the fi rst 
paragraph, which starts with the text Your wheels.
3 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel and select the word wheels at the top 
of the fi rst paragraph. You can select the word by clicking and dragging using your 
mouse or by double-clicking the word.
When using the Type tool, double-clicking on a word selects the word, triple-clicking selects the 
line, and quadruple-clicking (that’s four clicks!) selects the paragraph.
4 
Click the Character Styles button ( ) in the dock on the right side of the workspace 
to open the Character Styles panel. Choose Italic from the Character Styles panel to 
apply the Italic style to the selected word.
A Character style applies only to selected text. 
Apply styles across a story using Find/Change
You’ve seen how you can use Character Styles to easily apply formatting changes to 
selected text. In the text you are working in, you will change every instance of the word 
wheels to be italicized, combining character styles with InDesign’s ability to fi nd and then 
change text formatting.

Using styles
1 
Using the Type tool ( ), right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) anywhere 
within the text frame on page 2 of the document. Choose Find/Change from the 
contextual menu that appears—it’s near the top of the many choices available in the 
Contextual menu. The Find/Change window opens.
Contextual menus off er a quick way to access commands that apply to the part of the document 
in which you are working. The commands change based upon the location of the cursor, the tool 
you are using, and the object selected. In the previous step, the contextual menu options relate to 
text because the text tool is selected and the cursor is within a text frame.
2 
In the Find/Change window, click in the Text tab and type wheels in the Find what 
text fi eld, then choose Story from the Search drop-down menu. This tells InDesign to 
search all the text within the current story to locate the word wheels. A story is defi ned 
as all the columns and text frames that are linked together.
3 
In the Change Format section at the bottom of the window, click the Specify Attributes 
to Change button ( ). The Change Format Settings window opens.
Be careful to not select the Specify Attributes to Find button, which is an identical button located 
above the Specify Attributes to Change button.
Click the Specify attributes to change button to modify text 
attributes in specifi c words or phrases.

In the Change Format Settings dialog box, choose Italic from the Character Style 
menu and click OK. This changes the format of all text that is found, applying the 
Italic style to any text InDesign fi nds within the story.
Choose Italic from the Character Style drop-down menu.
5 
Click the Change All button. A window appears indicating that fi ve instances of 
wheels have been found and formatted using the style attributes you specifi ed. Press 
OK, then Press Done to close the Find/Change dialog box.
InDesign notifi es you of replacements it makes 
using the Find/Change option.
Applying object styles
You can use Object styles to apply formatting to entire objects rather than individual 
pieces of text or paragraphs. For example, you can use object styles to format entire text 
frames and picture frames. You can use object styles to quickly and consistently apply 
borders to objects, or eff ects such as a drop shadow. Object styles can combine character 
and paragraph styles so you can apply multiple formatting attributes to a frame and the 
contents of the frame in a single step. While doing this, you’ll also practice importing text 
and repositioning objects in a page layout.
Here you’ll place some text into a text frame and then apply an object style to the frame so 
that the entire frame is formatted in a single click.

In the Pages panel, double-click page 1. Once the page is displayed, you may need 
to decrease the magnifi cation to see the full page depending upon the size of your 
monitor and screen resolution. If you can’t see the full page, change the display 
magnifi cation by choosing a smaller percentage from the Zoom level drop-down 
menu located to the right of the Help menu in the Application bar. 
2 
If you can’t see the text frame located to the right side of the page in the pasteboard 
area, choose the Hand tool (
) from the Tools panel, then click and drag from the 
right to the left until this text frame is visible.
3 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel, and then click to insert the cursor inside 
the text frame on the pasteboard. Next you will import some type that was created 
using a word processor such as Microsoft Word.
4 
Choose File > Place to import a text fi le into this frame. In the Place dialog box, 
navigate to the Links folder within the id01lessons folder and select the fi le Sidebar.txt. 
Confi rm that Show Import Options is not selected, and then press Open.
5 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel and confi rm that the text frame on 
which you have been working remains selected. If necessary, click the frame to select it.
You can switch from the Type tool to the Selection tool and select the current text frame in a 
single step by pressing the Escape key on your keyboard when editing text within a frame.
6 
Choose Window > Styles > Object Styles to open the Object Styles panel. In the 
Object Styles panel, choose Sidebar from the list to apply these attributes to the 
selected frame. The entire frame, including the text, is formatted.
You can use Object styles to apply background colors, eff ects, and multiple text 
styles to a frame in a single click. This makes applying formatting, and keeping your 
document design consistent as easy as a single click.
Object styles format entire objects, including text within objects.
7 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click the middle of the frame and drag it to the column on 
the right side of the fi rst page, aligning the right edge and bottom edge of the frame 
with the right and bottom margin guides.

Working with graphics
Graphics are an integral part of page design, and InDesign puts you in control of cropping, 
sizing, borders, and eff ects controlling the appearance of images in your layout. You can 
place a wide variety of graphic types into your layouts, including PDF, TIFF, JPEG, and 
EPS. You can also place native Creative Suite fi les such as Photoshop (.psd), Illustrator (.ai), 
and even other InDesign (.indd) documents into your InDesign layout as graphics.
Placing graphics
Like text, graphics are also placed inside a frame when you import them into your layout. 
You can create the frame fi rst, and then import the text or you can create the frame at the 
same time you import the image, depending upon how you prefer to design your documents.
1 
Double-click page 4 in the Pages panel to display page 4 of the document, then choose 
Edit > Deselect All so that no objects are selected. If Deselect All is not available in 
the Edit menu, then no objects are selected.
2 
Click the Layers button in the panel docking area along the right side of the 
workspace to display the Layers panel, and then click the Graphics layer to make it 
active. Selecting this layer before placing a new image into the layout causes the image 
to be placed on this layer. You can put content on any layer, and create layers to help 
organize content in your InDesign documents.
Use layers to organize content in your InDesign documents.
3 
Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the Links folder within the 
id01lessons folder and select the fi le cyclist.psd; then click Open. Because no frame has 
been selected, InDesign changes the cursor to represent that an image is ready to be 
placed in the document.
4 
Move the cursor to the upper-left corner of the workspace where the red bleed guides 
intersect, outside of the page area. Click once to place the image at its full size.
5 
If the upper-left corner of the image is not correctly positioned at the intersection of 
the bleed guides, use the Selection tool ( ) to click and drag the image to the correct 
position. Next you will resize the image to cover the top half of the layout and extend 
(bleed) off  the edges of the layout.

1
35
Lesson 1, InDesign CS6 Essential Skills
Working with graphics
6 
To scale the image and also the frame in which it is contained, press and hold 
Shift+Ctrl (Windows) or Shift+Command (Mac OS). While continuing to hold 
down these keys on your keyboard, use your mouse to click and hold the handle 
located in the lower-right corner of the picture frame, dragging it down and to the 
right until the image extends off  the page. Align the right edge with the bleed guide 
lines located just outside the page area. Using the keyboard commands while scaling 
the image caused both the frame and image to scale proportionately. 
Scaling the image and the frame proportionately.
Depending upon the resolution of the original image, it is possible to scale the image too much 
and cause the image to become pixelated or bitmapped. If this occurs, the image will appear 
unclear when printed or converted to PDF. Most images can be scaled up to 20% without 
aff ecting their quality, but it is best to test the image in its fi nal intended format by printing 
or creating a digital document such as PDF, depending upon your fi nal destination. For more 
information about image quality and resolution, see the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Digital 
Classroom book, which is available in print or digital format.
7 
Next you will crop the image by reducing the height of the frame, keeping the image 
the same size, but reducing which parts of it will be visible. Locate the center handle 
along the bottom edge of the picture frame. Click and drag up on this handle until 
the bottom edge of the frame snaps to the guide located horizontally along the middle 
of the page. The image remains the same size, but the bottom is cropped and will not 
print or display when converted to a digital document.
Moving the handles of a frame using the Selection tool changes the size of the frame and adjusts 
how much of the image is displayed. If you move the handles while holding the Shift+Ctrl 
(Windows) or Shift+Command (Mac OS) modifi er keys on the keyboard, you can scale the 
image and content together.

Positioning graphics within a frame
You may need to crop or scale images that are placed in your layout. Here you will explore 
tools that help you position and scale of graphics in your documents.
1 
Navigate to page 1 by using the page drop-down menu located in the lower-left 
corner of the document window, or by double-clicking Page 1 in the Pages panel.
2 
To focus on the graphics, you’ll hide the Text layer. In the panel docking area along 
the right side of the workspace, click the Layers button to open the Layers panel, and 
then click the Visibility icon ( ) to hide the contents of the text layer.
3 
In the Tools panel, choose the Selection tool ( ), then click to select the graphic 
frame located in the bottom-left corner of page 1. The frame spans the left and center 
columns. Because the graphic frame is empty, an X is displayed inside the frame.
4 
Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the Links folder within the 
id01lessons folder and select the snowshoe.psd image. Confi rm that Show Import 
Options is not selected, then click Open. The image is placed inside the selected frame 
at its original size – 100 percent, and is larger than the frame. Next you will resize the 
image so it fi ts within the frame.
5 
Position your cursor over the center of the snowshoe image but do not click. A semi-
transparent circle appears in the center of the photo. This is the Content Indicator. 
Click the Content Indicator to select the photo within the frame. The edges of the 
image are displayed with a light-blue border, showing the size of the graphic. The 
color of the border varies when you use multiple layers in your documents. You’ll now 
reposition the document so you can see the entire size of the image.
The Content Indicator makes it easy to adjust a graphic within a 
frame without having to choose a diff erent tool to do so.

6 
If you can see the complete border of the image, you can skip to step 7. Otherwise, 
press and hold the spacebar on your keyboard to temporarily access the Hand tool (
). 
Click and hold on the document. The page magnifi cation changes and a red frame 
appears when using the Hand tool. Reposition the red frame so the entire border of 
the image is visible, and then release the mouse. The zoom returns to its original level, 
focused on the portion of the page you identifi ed. Release the spacebar. If necessary, 
use the magnifi cation levels located at the top of the menu bar, to the right of the Help 
menu, to reduce the magnifi cation in order to see the entire bounds of the graphic.
Press and hold the spacebar on your keyboard to access the 
Hand tool for repositioning documents.
7 
With the content of the frame, the snowshoe image, still selected, press and hold the 
Shift key on your keyboard. Click the handle in the bottom-right corner of the image 
and drag the handle up and to the left, reducing the size of the image until its width 
is slightly larger than the width of the frame, then release the mouse button. Here you 
scaled the content of the image without modifying the frame. Pressing the Shift key 
maintained the proportions of the image while it was scaled.

8 
Move the cursor to the middle of the picture frame and notice that the cursor changes 
to a hand. While the cursor is a Hand icon (
), click and drag to reposition the 
graphic within the frame so that the person in the light blue jacket is located along the 
right side of the picture frame.
Clicking the Content Indicator selects the graphic inside the frame. The Hand icon indicates 
you can reposition the graphic. While the icon is identical to the Hand tool, it is used only to 
reposition graphics within a frame, while the Hand tool is accessed from the Tools panel and is 
used for adjusting the display within the document window. 
The cropped image should appear similar to this fi gure.
9 
To edit the frame instead of the content of the frame, double-click anywhere on the 
graphic. The frame becomes selected again.
10 Using your keyboard, press Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS) to fi t page 1 
within the document window.
11 If the Layers panel isn’t already open, click the Layers button, then click the Visibility 
icon ( ) in the Text layer so that objects on this layer are once again displayed. 
12 Choose File > Save to save your work. Keep the document open for the next part of 
this lesson.

Lesson 1, InDesign CS6 Essential Skills
Working with graphics
Applying text wrap
You can control the position of text relative to graphics and other objects. In some cases, 
you may want text to be placed on top of an image, while in other cases, you may want 
text to wrap around the shape of an image or object. You’ll continue to work on the fi rst 
page of the brochure, applying text wrap to an image.
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click to select the snowshoe image at the bottom of the 
page. Click between the two columns of text, but be careful to not click the Content 
Indicator circle at the center of the image, as you will be manipulating the frame 
attributes in this exercise, and not working with the content. Next you’ll enable text 
wrap on the image to force the text away from the image.
If you have trouble selecting the image, press the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) 
key and then click again on the image to select it. This enables you to select an object beneath 
another object in a layout. In this case, the image is positioned below the text frames, so the key 
command makes it easier to select. 
2 
Choose Window > Text Wrap to open the Text Wrap panel.
3 
Click the Wrap Around Bounding Box button ( ) at the top of the Text Wrap panel 
to apply the text wrap to the selected image. The text wrap forces the text to fl ow into 
the second column, making all the text visible.
The Wrap Around Bounding Box 
button in the Text Wrap panel wraps 
the text around the shape of an object.
4 
To get a better understanding of how the text wrap is being applied to the text 
surrounding the graphic frame, use the Selection tool to move the snowshoe image 
up or down on page 1. As you move the image, see how the text moves around the 
frame. When you’re fi nished, move the image back to its original location.
5 
Click the two arrows pointing to the right in the upper-right corner of the Text 
Wrap panel to close it. You will work more with Text Wrap in InDesign Lesson 5, 
“Working with Graphics.”

Understanding layers
Layers help you organize your layout. By positioning related objects together on the same 
layer, you can turn items off  and on for viewing, working on your layout, and even for 
printing. Layers can even be used to create diff erent versions of projects.
Here you will place text and graphics on separate layers making it easier to proofread text.
1 
Using the Pages panel, double-click Page 2 to navigate to this page, then choose 
View > Fit Spread in Window to display both pages 2 and 3 together. Two adjoining 
pages in a layout are referred to as a Spread. 
2 
Click the Layers button ( ) in the panel docking area to open the Layers panel.
Use the Layers panel to organize 
objects in your layout.
If you have closed a panel instead of placing it in the docking area, you can access it from the Window 
menu. For example, you can choose Window > Pages to open the Pages panel. The list of available 
panels is also determined by the current workspace. To access all panels, choose the Advanced 
workspace from the Workspace switcher located at the top-right corner of the Application bar. 
3 
In the Layers panel there are three layers: Text, Graphics, and Background Content. 
Click the Visibility icon ( ) next to the Text layer. Any content on the Text layer is 
hidden. Click the Visibility icon again to show the contents of the Text layer.
4 
Click to turn the visibility of the Graphics and Background Content layers on and off  
to see the items that are located on each of these layers.
InDesign layers are document-wide. When you create a layer, it is available on every page in the 
document, including the master pages. When you hide or show a layer, all pages in the document 
are aff ected by this change.
5 
If necessary, open the Pages panel by clicking the Pages Panel icon (
) or choose 
Window > Pages. In the Pages panel, double-click page 1 to navigate to this page.

Using the Selection tool ( ), click to select the frame containing the snowshoe image 
at the bottom of the page. If you have trouble selecting it, click the Visibility icon ( ) 
for the Text layer to temporarily hide the text frames. After selecting the image frame, 
click the Visibility icon for the Text layer to display the text. In the Layers panel, 
notice the red square ( ) located to the right of the Graphics layer. This indicates that 
the currently selected object is located on the Graphics layer.
7 
If the Layers panel is not visible, click the Layers panel icon (
) or choose Window > 
Layers. In the Layers panel, click and drag the red square to the Background Content 
layer. The object is moved to this layer, and the edge of the frame containing the 
snowshoe graphic is now green, the color of the Background Content layer.
Moving an object between layers.
8 
Click the Visibility icon of the Background Content layer to hide the contents of the 
layer, confi rming that the snowshoe image is on this layer. Click the Visibility icon 
again to make the layer visible.
9 
Click the square immediately to the left of the Background Content layer to lock this 
layer. Locking the layer prevents you or others from modifying any contents on a layer.
Locking a layer prevents any changes 
to objects on the layer.
10 Choose the Selection tool and click the snowshoe picture on page 1. You cannot 
currently select it because the layer is locked.

11 Unlock the layer by clicking on the Padlock icon ( ) immediately to the left of the 
Background Content layer. Locking a layer prevents all items on that layer from being 
selected. You can use this to organize your layout as you construct your documents. 
For example, you can create a layer that contains all the guides for your document and 
lock it so the guides are not accidentally selected, and you can easily show and hide 
guides that are all placed on a single layer. 
If you accidentally select the wrong object, choose Edit > Deselect All, or if you accidentally move 
an object, choose Edit > Undo to return it to the original location.
Applying effects
You can use InDesign to apply special eff ects to images or objects in your layout, 
including adding drop shadows to frames, soft feathered edges to pictures, or adjusting the 
transparency or opacity of objects and images – all without modifying the original object. 
Here you will discover how to apply eff ects to objects.
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click page 2 or use the page drop-down menu in the 
lower-left corner of the workspace to navigate to page 2 of the newsletter.
2 
Using the Selection tool ( ), select the blue border in the upper-left corner of the page. 
The border spans pages 2 and 3.

Answers
1 
There is more text in the frame than can be displayed within the current frame. This 
is called overset text. You can fi x this by linking the text to another frame, editing the 
text so that it fi ts within the existing frame, or enlarging the size of the frame.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Lesson 2
Master pages serve as the foundation for InDesign documents that 
are more than a few pages in length. You can use master pages to 
maintain consistency throughout your document and work more 
effi  ciently. If you plan to create only short documents, such as one-
pages sales sheets or two-page fl yers, you may want to skip over this 
lesson and go to Lesson 3, “Working with Text and Type.”
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in the Starting up 
section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the id02lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have copied the id02lessons folder onto your hard drive from the included DVD. See 
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. This lesson may be easier to 
follow if the id02lessons folder is on your desktop.
Building Documents 
with Master Pages
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Creating and saving 
custom page sizes
• Creating page guides
• Adding sections
• Using automatic page 
numbering
• Creating master pages 
and applying them to 
document pages

See Lesson 2 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
The project
In this lesson, you will create a magazine. You will use master pages to create layout 
templates for each section in the magazine, including running headers, which run across 
the top of the page, and running footers, which run across the bottom of the page. Master 
pages give the publication a consistent look and feel.
This lesson provides a foundation in creating InDesign documents, and is focused on a 
print-layout example.
Planning your document
Before you start creating a print document using InDesign, you need some important 
information: the fi nal size of the document after it is fi nished, also known as the trim size; 
how the pages will be held together, also known as the binding; and whether the document 
has images or graphics that extend to the edge of the document—this is known as bleed. 
Once you have this information, you can create the templates for your document pages. 
Digital documents have diff erent considerations, such as the screen size and resolution.
When you create simple designs or small documents for one-time use you can work directly on the 
document pages, and not create master pages. Master pages are more suitable for longer documents 
or documents that use a repeating design on several pages.
Creating custom page sizes
For this lesson, you will create the print version of a custom-sized magazine with colors 
that extend to the edge of the page. You’ll start by creating a new document, and saving 
the custom size as a preset, which you can use to create subsequent issues of the magazine.
Creating a new custom-sized document
This document will be measured using inches, so you’ll start by setting your units of 
measurement to inches, and then you’ll create the custom document size. 
1 
With no documents open, choose Edit > Preferences > Units & Increments 
(Windows), or InDesign > Preferences > Units & Increments (Mac OS). When the 
Preferences dialog box appears, choose Inches from the Vertical and Horizontal drop-
down menus in the Ruler Units section. Press OK.

49
Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Creating custom page sizes
Changing the unit of measurement when no documents are open causes InDesign to 
use these settings for all new documents you create.
When working in a document, you can switch the unit of measurement for that document by 
right-clicking (Windows) or Control+clicking (Mac OS) on the vertical or horizontal ruler.
2 
Choose File > New > Document, or press Ctrl+N (Windows) or Command+N (Mac 
OS), to open the New Document dialog box, which is the fi rst step in creating a new 
InDesign document.
3 
In the New Document dialog box, confi rm that the Facing Pages check box is selected 
and that Print is chosen from the Intent drop-down menu. In the Page Size section, 
type 8.125 in for the Width and 10.625 in for the Height.

Creating and formatting master pages
Master pages serve as a template upon which all document pages are created. They provide 
the framework for the design of all pages in your document. Diff erent master pages may 
be created for various sections of your publication, such as a magazine or a catalog. By 
creating master pages for each section, you can maintain a consistent appearance for all 
pages in these sections.
The document you are creating for this lesson currently contains one document page and one 
master page. You will add more document pages and more master pages. You will add master 
pages for the various sections of the magazine. Each of these sections has a diff erent layout, 
with a diff erent number of columns, margins, and headers. By creating the master pages 
before working on the document, you can quickly create pages with a consistent design.
1 
Press the Pages button ( ) in the panel docking area, or press the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+F12 (Windows) or Command+F12 (Mac OS), to open the Pages panel. Double-
click the A-Master label in the top portion of the Pages panel.

The A-Master page is displayed and centered within your workspace. Keep the 
A-Master page selected in the Pages panel.
Double-clicking a page label in the 
Pages panel centers the page in the 
workspace.
2 
In the Pages panel, press the panel menu button ( ) and select Master Options for 
A-Master. Alternatively, you can hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) 
key and click once on the A-Master text (not the Page icon) in the Pages panel. The 
Master Options dialog box appears. Next you will rename this master page to refl ect 
the role of this master page in the layout. 
3 
In the Name text fi eld of the Master Options dialog box, type Footer. Leave all 
other settings unchanged, and press OK. This changes the name from A-Master to 
A-Footer. You will now add a footer that runs across the bottom of this master page, 
and then apply this master page to document pages. 
Change the name of a master page using the Master Options dialog box.
Formatting master pages
For this publication, the A-Footer page will also serve as the foundation for the other 
master pages. Although master pages can be used independently of one another, for this 
publication all items appearing on A-Footer will also appear on all other master pages. 
This allows you to quickly create a consistent footer across every page. The other master 
pages will have unique header information identifying each section of the magazine.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Creating and formatting master pages
Adding automatic page numbers
You can have InDesign automatically apply page numbers, and using master pages makes it 
easy to have them applied in the same location on every page. 
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click the Left Page icon for the A-Footer master page. This 
fi ts the left side of your A-Footer master page in the window. Before you add a page 
number, you’ll create a guide to help you place it in the ideal location on your page.
2 
Using the Selection tool ( ), position the cursor onto the horizontal ruler running 
across the top of the page. Ctrl+click (Windows) or Command+click (Mac OS) and 
drag down from the ruler to create a horizontal ruler guide. Continue dragging until 
the ruler guide is positioned at 10.25 inches. You can determine the location of the 
guide in the Control panel, and by using the live transformation values that appear as 
you drag the guide. The position updates as you drag the guide.
Pressing and holding the Ctrl or Command key while dragging causes the guide to go 
across the entire spread, rather than only one page. 
If the page rulers aren’t visible, choose View > Show Rulers or press Ctrl+R (Windows) or 
Command+R (Mac OS).
3 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Position the Type tool so the 
intersecting horizontal and vertical lines near the bottom of the tool are positioned at 
the bottom-left corner of the page margin guides, where the left margin guide and 
the bottom margin guide meet. This is just above the ruler guide you created in the 
previous step. Click and drag down and to the right, creating a text frame that extends 
from the bottom margin guide down to the guide you created in the previous step and 
to the right to the 1 inch position. You can see the position of the frame being created 
in the Control panel and in the horizontal ruler located at the top of the page.

page is applied. If you prefer to use keyboard commands, you can press Shift+Alt+Ctrl+N 
(Windows) or Shift+Option+Command+N (Mac OS) to have an automatic page 
number inserted. The letter A is inserted into the text frame and acts as a placeholder for 
the actual page number. The placeholder displays the master page letter when viewed on 
a master page, and the actual page number when viewed on a document page.
The Insert Special Characters menu can also be accessed by right-clicking (Windows) or 
Control+clicking (Mac OS) when the cursor is within a text frame.
5 
Using the Type tool, select the letter A that you inserted into the text frame so you 
can customize the appearance of the page number. In the Character Formatting 
Controls portion of the Control panel, choose Myriad Pro and Bold from the font 
and style drop-down menus, and choose 12pt from the font size drop-down menu. 
Continuing to work in the Control panel, click the Paragraph Formatting Controls 
button ( ) and then click the Align away from Spine button ( ). This aligns the text to 
the opposite edge of the binding of the publication.

Notice that the page number automatically changes to align to the right side of the 
text frame because you selected the Align away from Spine option.
Using text variables
You use text variables to insert dynamic text that changes contextually. InDesign includes 
several pre-defi ned text variables including Chapter Number, File Name, Output Date, 
and Running Header. You can also edit any of these variables, or create new variables. 
This makes it easy to consistently apply text across a document, and easily update the text 
in one place and have all other occurrences of the text updated in a single step.
Defining new text variables
You will create variable text for your magazine title and page footers. 
1 
Choose Type > Text Variables > Defi ne. The Text Variables dialog box appears.

Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel and make sure the text frame that 
you drew in Step 2 is selected. Choose Object > Text Frame Options. In the Text 
Frame Options dialog box, select Bottom from the Align drop-down menu located 
in the Vertical Justifi cation section in the General Tab. This causes the text to align 
to the bottom of the text frame. Press OK. You will now duplicate this box, placing a 
copy of it on the adjacent page.
7 
Continuing to use the Selection tool, press and hold the Alt key (Windows) or Option 
key (Mac OS). While holding this key, click and drag the box you created to the page 
on the right side of the layout. The box is duplicated. Pressing and holding the Alt or 
Option key duplicates objects as you move them. 
As you are dragging an object such as the text frame in step 7, you can also add the Shift key 
while dragging. This constrains the movement of the object horizontally, ensuring that the 
original and duplicate objects are aligned. The Shift key can also be used to constrain objects 
movement vertically as well, maintaining the left-right position on the page.
8 
Position the duplicate frame so that the left edge aligns with the left margin guide, and 
the bottom of the duplicate frame remains aligned to the ruler guide you created.
Position the duplicate text frame along the ruler guide, aligning the left edge with the left margin guide.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Creating and formatting master pages
Basing master pages on other master pages
You can create additional master pages, and these pages can use the same formatting and 
layout that you’ve already created for the A-Footer master page. In the next exercise, you’ll 
import master pages that have already been created in another document. You’ll then apply 
the A-Footer master page to these master pages to create a consistent layout and appearance.
To create your own master pages, choose the New Master command from the Pages panel menu ( ).
1 
If it isn’t already open, open the Pages panel by pressing the Pages button ( ) in the 
dock. In the Pages panel, press the panel menu button ( ) and choose Master Pages > 
Load Master Pages. The Open a File dialog box appears.
2 
In the Open a File dialog box, navigate to the id02lessons folder and select the 
fi le called id02styles.indd. Press Open. Four new master pages are added to your 
document and are displayed in the Master Pages section of the Pages panel. If 
necessary, click and drag downward on the horizontal line separating the master pages 
from the document pages in the Pages panel. These master pages correspond to the 
various sections of the magazine. Next, you’ll apply the A-Footer master page you 
created earlier to these new master pages so that they have a consistent appearance.
Click and drag downward on the line 
separating the master pages from the 
document pages to display the newly 
added master pages.
3 
Double-click on the name B-TOC/Editorial master page in the Pages panel. By 
clicking the name instead of the icon, the entire spread is displayed. 
4 
In the Pages panel menu, choose Master Options for B-TOC/Editorial. You can also 
access the Master Options by holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) 
key while clicking on the name of the master page. The Master Options dialog box is 
displayed.

5 
In the Master Options dialog box, click the Based on Master drop-down menu and 
choose A-Footer, then press OK. 
Notice that the B-TOC/Editorial master page now includes the footer you created. In 
the Pages panel, the page icons for B-TOC/Editorial display the letter A, indicating 
that these master pages are based on the master page A you created. 
Base the page on the A-Footer master page. 
The A indicates that this master page 
 
is linked to master page A.
6 
In the Pages panel, click and drag the name A-Footer onto the name C-Feature in 
the master page section. This applies the formatting found on Master Page A to the 
destination page. By dragging the pages using their name, all pages in the spread are 
aff ected.
7 
Drag and drop the A-Footer master page on top of master pages: master page D and E.
Overriding master page items
When you apply a Master page to another page, the items on the master page are locked 
and cannot be accidentally modifi ed on the page to which they have been applied.
In the next exercise, you’ll unlock some of the master page items that have been applied 
to another page and then selectively delete items from the master page that may not be 
needed on certain document pages. 
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click the left side of the B-TOC/Editorial master page. 
Notice that the text frames’ edges surrounding the footer that you created appear as 
dotted lines. This indicates that these items are part of a master page that has been 
applied to this page, and that they are locked and cannot be edited.
2 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Place the cursor anywhere over 
the footer and click. Notice that it is not selected because it was applied from a master 
page, and remains locked for editing as long as it remains attached to a master page. 
To modify this frame, you will indicate to InDesign that the object should be made 
available for editing. This process is known as overriding a master page item. 
3 
Continuing to use the Selection tool, press the Shift+Ctrl keys (Windows) or 
Shift+Command keys (Mac OS) and click the text frames containing the page number 
and footer. Using these keys you can select master page items and make them available 
for editing. Press Delete to remove these frames from this page.

Choose File > Save to save your work.
When you use Shift+Control+click (Windows) or Shift+Command+click (Mac OS) to select 
and change a master page item, the changed item is referred to as a local override. The master 
page remains applied to the page, and only the items you select and modify are considered to have 
a local override to their appearance. To override all master page items on a page, select a page in 
the Pages panel and choose Override All Master Page Items from the Pages panel menu ( ).
Adding placeholder frames to master pages
Creating text and image frames on master pages makes it easier to develop a consistent 
layout, and you can quickly add content to the placeholder frames. When you create image 
frames on a master page, you can use frame-fi tting options to control how images are sized 
after they are placed into the frames.
1 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel and create a text frame on the left side 
of the B-TOC/Editorial master page, which contains the headline In This Issue. The 
position and dimensions of the text frame you create are not important, as you will 
defi ne these in the next step. 
2 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel and make sure the text frame you 
created in the previous step is still selected. In the Control panel, set the reference point 
( ) to top-left and type 2.95 in for X and 1.4 in for Y to set the location of the frame. 
Then type 4.625 in for W and 3.6 in for H to set the width and height of the frame. 
Use the Control panel to set the exact location of the text frame.
3 
Now you’ll add a number of image frames on the left side of the page. Select the 
Rectangle Frame tool ( ) from the Tools panel and draw a small rectangle to the left 
of the text frame you created in the previous step. You will also use the Control panel 
to set the exact position and dimensions for this frame.

Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel and make sure the frame you created 
in the last step is selected. In the Control panel, make sure the reference point ( ) is 
set to top-left and type the following values to set the dimensions and position: X: 
-.125 in Y: 1.4 in W: 2.4 in H: 1.625 in. 
The image frame you created is aligned to the top of the text frame, and bleeds off  
the left side of the page. Next you will defi ne how images placed in this frame will be 
sized. This is not required for frames, although it saves time when creating a design 
template or master page that may be used for many jobs or publications. 
5 
Continuing to use the Selection tool, make certain the image frame you created in 
step three is still selected. If necessary, click to select it. Choose Object > Fitting > 
Frame Fitting Options. In the Frame Fitting Options dialog box, choose Fill Frame 
Proportionally from the Fitting drop-down menu, located in the Content Fitting 
section. Press OK. This will cause any image placed into this frame to be scaled so 
that it fully fi ts within the frame. 
You’ll now duplicate the empty frame, using a process known as Step and Repeat.
Choose Fill Frame Proportionally in the Frame Fitting Options dialog box to 
control how images placed in this frame will be sized.
6 
With the image frame still selected, choose Edit > Step and Repeat. Step and Repeat 
makes it easy for you to duplicate an object several times, placing each duplicate copy 
in a specifi c location.

Locking Master Items and setting text wrap
In the fi rst lesson, you discovered how to wrap text around an object on a document page. 
Here you will wrap text around a shape on a master page.
1 
In the Pages panel double-click the right page icon of the B-TOC/Editorial master 
page. Using the Selection tool ( ), select the oval shape on the left side of the page and 
right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) on the shape. Be certain to select 
the oval shape and not the text frame that sits on top of the oval. In the contextual 
menu, turn off  the Allow Master Item Overrides option so that it does not display a 
check mark. This prohibits designers from making changes to this master page object 
once it is part of a document page.
The Allow Master Item Overrides option is 
enabled by default. When disabled, master 
items cannot be changed on a document page.

Choose Window > Text Wrap. This opens the Text Wrap panel. From the panel, 
select the Wrap around object shape option ( ) and set the Top Off set to .25 inches, 
causing any text that is placed adjacent to this frame to wrap around the oval, placing 
¼-inch distance between the text and the oval. 
Use the Text Wrap panel to push  
Here the text wraps above 
text away from a frame or object.  
the image, off set by ¼ inch.
When the Wrap around object shape option is chosen for this object, all the off set fi elds are 
grayed-out except for the top value. This is because this object has an irregular shape. The top 
value will be used to specify the wrap on all sides. For rectangular or square objects, the value can 
be adjusted on all four sides independently.
3 
Close the Text Wrap panel.
Adding layout pages
Now that you have created and formatted all the master pages, you can start to lay out the 
document pages of the magazine. You’ll start by adding pages to the document. 
1 
Double-click on page 1 in the Pages panel and choose Layout > Pages > Add Page, 
or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Control+P (Windows) or Shift+Command+P 
(Mac OS), to add a page to the document. The Pages panel now displays two page 
icons, as the new page is added to the end of the document.

Next you’ll insert the pages that will contain the Table of Contents and editorial content.
Adding a page to the document using the Layout menu.
2 
In the Pages panel, Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac OS) on the Create new 
page button ( ) at the bottom of the Pages panel to open the Insert Pages dialog box.
3 
In the Insert Pages dialog box, type 2 in the Pages fi eld, and from the Insert drop-
down menu select After Page and type 1 to have two pages added after page 1. Select 
B-TOC/Editorial from the Master drop-down menu, then press OK.
This causes two pages to be added after page 1, and the new pages use the B-TOC/
Editorial master page.
Adding multiple pages to the document. The new pages are based on a specifi c 
master page.
Two pages are inserted between pages 1 and 2, and the B-TOC/Editorial master 
page is applied to the new pages. This magazine has 12 pages. Because the pages will 
belong to diff erent sections of the magazine, diff erent master pages will be applied to 
them. Here you will add the pages to the document, and later in the exercise you will 
discover how to apply master pages to the document pages.
4 
At the bottom of the Pages panel, Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac OS) the 
Create new page button ( ). The Insert Pages dialog box appears.

In the Insert Pages dialog box, type 9 in the Pages text fi eld. Select After Page from 
the Insert drop-down menu, and type 4 in the text fi eld. Choose None from the 
Master drop-down menu, then press OK. 
This inserts nine blank pages into your fi le after page 4. You now have 13 pages in the 
document. Because the document is only 12 pages, you’ll practice deleting a page.
6 
Double-click the icon representing Page 4 in the Pages panel. This highlights the icon 
in the Pages panel and displays this document page. 
7 
Click the Delete selected pages button ( ) at the bottom of the Pages panel. This 
deletes page 4 and leaves you with the 12 pages you need for this issue. 
8 
Choose File > Save to save your document. Keep it open for the next exercise.
Primary text frames 
When creating a master page you can specify a primary text frame. A primary text frame is 
useful if you have one frame containing the majority of the text on a page, and the master 
page applied to that document page is subject to change. 
If a different master page is applied to a document page that uses a primary text frame, the 
text automatically flows from the old primary text frame into the new primary text frame. 
Additionally, primary text frames can be worked with on a document page more easily, as 
they are automatically overridden and do not require any additional adjustments before using 
them in your layout.
You can designate a text frame on any master page as a primary text frame by clicking to 
select the frame and then clicking the primary text frame symbol located near the top of the 
left edge of a text frame. There is only one master text frame per master page.
A master text frame before being converted to a primary text frame (left) and after being converted to a 
primary text frame (right). Designate a primary text frame on a master page to more easily adjust text layout 
when a new master page is applied to a document page.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Adding layout pages
Setting numbering and section options
Now that you have the pages needed for the magazine you can defi ne the numbering and 
sections. The fi rst page of the document is sensibly considered to be page 1 as the page 
numbers are automatically applied to the document. In this magazine, the fi rst page will 
be the cover and the back side of the cover will contain the table of contents. The third 
page of the publication is where the page numbering will start. You will change the page 
numbering using the numbering and section options.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Adding layout pages
Placing formatted text
Next you will add some content to the editorial page, importing text from a Microsoft 
Word document that includes pre-formatted text styles. You’ll then complete the editorial 
page by adding a picture of the editor.
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click the third page of the document. This is the page you 
set to page 1 in the previous exercise.
2 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel and draw a small text frame on the right 
side of the page. The exact size and location isn’t important; you’ll use the Control 
panel to specify these values.
3 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel—or you can press the Escape key 
on your keyboard to switch to the Selection tool—and make sure the text frame is 
selected. In the Control panel at the top of the workspace, make sure the reference 
point is set to top-left. Type 11" in the X text fi eld and 3" in the Y text fi eld. Also 
type 4.75" in the W text fi eld and 6.875" in the H text fi eld. 
Use the Control panel to defi ne the size and position of the text frame after you create it.
4 
With the text frame still selected, choose File > Place At the bottom of the Place 
dialog box, make sure Show Import Options and Replace Selected Item are both selected. 
Navigate to the id02lessons folder and select the fi le Editorial.doc, then click Open. 
The Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box appears.
5 
In the Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box, make sure the Preserve Styles 
and Formatting from Text and Tables radio button is selected. Confi rm that Import 
Styles Automatically is selected, and that Use InDesign Style Defi nition is selected for 
both Paragraph Style Confl icts and Character Style Confl icts. Leave all other settings 
unchanged, and then press OK.

The Word document is placed into the selected text frame and text styles from the 
Word document are automatically converted to the InDesign paragraph styles because 
the styles in each application have been identically named. 
Use the Import Options to adjust styles created in Microsoft Word when importing 
a Microsoft Word document into an InDesign layout.
When importing text from Microsoft Word, you can have headlines, titles, body copy, and 
other formatting defi ned in the Microsoft Word document carried over into the InDesign layout. 
By choosing the Use InDesign Styles option in the Import Options dialog box, you can have 
identically named styles in a Microsoft Word document mapped to an InDesign style of the same 
name. You can use this to have editors and writers identify which styles should be applied to text 
before it is brought into a layout.
6 
Because the editor’s picture is likely to remain the same in every issue of the magazine, 
it makes sense to place this photo on the master page. In the Pages panel, double-click 
the right-hand page of the B-TOC/Editorial master page. Choose File > Place. In 
the Place dialog box, navigate to the id02lessons folder and select the fi le editor.jpg. 
Uncheck Show Import Options and also uncheck Replace Selected Item. Click Open to 
import this image. The cursor changes to a loaded cursor, indicating that InDesign is 
ready to place an image into your layout.

Creating the classified page
Goods for sale and professional services are often advertised on a classifi ed advertising page 
located in the back of a magazine. Because most of the space is sold to smaller merchants, 
these layouts typically involve narrow columns to pack as many small ads as possible into 
the space. In this case, a four-column layout with an appropriate header has already been 
created for you. You will apply the master page and then import the text for the classifi ed 
advertisements.
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click page 9. Press the Pages panel menu button ( ), and 
choose Apply Master to Pages. The Apply Master dialog box appears.
2 
From the Apply Master drop-down menu, choose the master page E-Classifi eds. 
Confi rm that the page to which this will be applied is listed as page 9. If necessary, 
type 9 in this fi eld. Click OK. The header, footer, and four-column layout of the 
E-Classifi eds master page are applied to page 9. 
Use the Apply Master option to apply a master page to page 9 of the document.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Adding layout pages
Adding images and text to the master frames
Earlier in this lesson, you added frames to a master page. Now that this master page has been 
applied to document pages, you will add content to these frames on the document pages.
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click page II, which will contain the table of contents. The 
image and text frames you added earlier have dotted borders, indicating that these 
frames are located on a master page.
2 
Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box uncheck Show Import Options and Replace 
Selected Item so these items are not selected. If necessary, navigate to the id02lessons 
folder and locate the TOC images folder. Double-click to open the folder and select 
the fi le photo1.jpg. Click Open to select this fi le. The cursor changes to refl ect that an 
image is ready to be placed into the layout.
3 
Move the cursor over the top image frame located on the left side of the page, and 
click, placing the image inside the frame. The image is automatically resized using the 
fi tting options you specifi ed when creating the frame on the master page. 
When images and text are placed into frames that were created on master pages, the frames 
become document page items, and can be selected or modifi ed, although they retain the properties 
from the master page. These objects are considered to have a local override applied to them, and 
will update if changes are made to their original master page objects. 
4 
Choose File > Place and click on the image photo2.jpg, and Shift+click on photo4.jpg 
to select all three images at the same time. Click Open. The cursor icon contains the 
number (3), indicating that there are three images to place in the document.
5 
Click the second frame from the top, placing the next photo. Continue clicking the 
empty frames, placing the remaining photos.
If the photos in your loaded cursor don’t appear in the order that you’d like, pressing the up- or 
down-arrow keys on your keyboard cycles through the images that you have selected to place into 
your layout.
Now you’ll fi nish the TOC/Editorial spread by adding the Table of Contents to the 
text frame on the right side of page II.

Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the id02lessons folder. Select 
the TOC.rtf fi le. Make sure that Show Import Options and Replace Selected Item are still 
unchecked. Click Open.
Primary Text Frame
When applying a new master page layout to a document page that has an existing layout, 
you may end up duplicating the existing text and its frame along with any frames in the new 
master page that has been applied to the existing document page. To avoid this, you may 
want to specify a primary text frame on a master page. 
To establish a primary text frame, click the primary text frame icon in the upper-left corner 
of the text frame or right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) on a master page 
text frame and select “Primary Text Frame” from the contextual menu. Only one story on a 
master page can be specified as primary text frame.
Specifying that a text frame on a master 
page contains the primary text fl ow.

Lesson 2, Building Documents with Master Pages 
Adding layout pages
Just like the Editorial and Classifi ed sections, the TOC.rtf fi le is pre-formatted using 
paragraph styles. In the next section of this exercise, you’ll apply the remaining master 
pages and see how InDesign updates the content in the footer of each page.
The completed Table of Contents page.
Applying master pages to multiple pages
Next you’ll complete your work on this magazine by assigning master pages to the remaining 
pages in the magazine. The editorial content for this publication may not be complete, but 
you’ll get the design ready for the fi nal text to be placed as soon as it is completed.
1 
In the Pages panel, press the panel menu button ( ) and choose Apply Master to Pages. 
In the Apply Master dialog box, choose C-Feature from the Apply Master drop-down 
menu. In the To Pages text fi eld, type 2-4 so that master page C-Feature is applied to 
pages 2–4. Be sure to add the hyphen (-) between the 2 and 4. Click OK. The master 
page is applied to the pages.
2 
Click the Pages panel menu button again and choose Apply Master to Pages. In the 
Apply Master dialog box, choose D-News from the Field from the Apply Master 
drop-down menu and type 5-8 in the To Pages text fi eld. Click OK to apply master 
page D to pages 5–8.
In the main document window, scroll through the document pages. The text variables 
inserted in the footer have been automatically populated with the magazine title and 
issue. The master pages and text variables provide a convenient way to save time and 
maintain consistency throughout your design.

Self study
Create a newsletter for your friends or family. Include a number of sections such as a page 
with profi les of people, stories relating to events or travels, favorite quotes, top ten lists, 
and photo galleries. Think about which of these sections share common elements, and 
design master pages to create a consistent design across these sections. Use headers, footers, 
guides, text frames, and picture frames on your master pages. If you fi nd yourself repeating 
steps on multiple pages, consider how you can use features like master pages and text 
variables to streamline your design process.

The project
In this lesson you will use add text into your layout and import type created using a word 
processing program such as Microsoft Word. You will also use InDesign’s text controls to 
control text formatting as you create a layout for a fi ctitious magazine, Tech. 
To view the fi nished project before starting, choose File > Open, navigate to the 
id03lessons folder, select id0301_done.indd, and then click Open. Choose View > Fit Page 
in Window or press Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS). After reviewing the 
layout, you can keep the lesson open for reference, or close it by choosing File > Close. 
You’ll use InDesign’s Typography workspace for this lesson. From the Workplace Switcher 
menu, choose Typography.
Adding text to your document
Text in an InDesign layout is typically contained within a text frame. You can create text 
frames using the Type tool or use any of the other frame or shape tools to create an object 
that can easily be converted to a text frame. You can also add text into your layout that 
was created using other programs, such as Microsoft Word. 
Creating a frame is usually the starting point for adding text to a layout. You’ll start by using 
the most effi  cient way to defi ne a new text frame: clicking and dragging with the Type tool. 
Creating a text frame
You will start by creating a new text frame and then enter text into the frame.
1 
Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the id03lessons folder, select 
the fi le id0301.indd, and then click Open. You’ll start by working on the fi rst page of 
this document. If necessary, double-click the page 1 icon in the Pages panel to navigate 
to this page.
The lower-left section of page 1 has a listing of the stories featured in this issue. You 
will create a text frame above this box and add text to it.
If necessary, use the Pages panel to navigate to the fi rst page.

Lesson 3, Working with Text and Type
Adding text to your document
2 
Choose the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Position the cursor on the left edge 
of the page so it is at the margin guide, approximately one-half inch above the list of 
stories. Use your mouse to click and drag diagonally down and to the right to create 
a new text frame. Release the mouse when it is positioned just above the existing 
text frame that contains the list of stories. The new frame should be placed above 
the existing frame and the left and right edges should be similarly positioned to the 
corresponding edges of the existing frame 
Click and drag with the Type tool 
to create a new frame.
3 
Type Inside this issue: into the text frame. 
If you need to reposition the text frame, choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel, then 
click and drag the frame to move it. You can also use the frame handles to adjust the size of the 
frame. When using the Selection tool, you can switch to the Type tool ( ) by double-clicking on 
a text frame. 
4 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the id03lessons folder 
and type id0301_work.indd in the Name text fi eld. Click Save to save the fi le.
Creating multiple frames
When drawing a text frame, pressing the right-arrow key one time will divide the text frame 
being created into two linked text frames. Pressing the arrow key a second time will create 
a third linked frame, which you can continue until you have the desired number of frames. 
Similarly, pressing the up-arrow key divides the text frames vertically into separate frames. 
You can divide a frame both vertically and horizontally to create a grid of text frames. This 
can also be used when creating image frames or other shapes.

Changing character attributes
You can use the Control panel located at the top of the workspace to adjust text formatting. 
The Character Formatting Controls button (A), and, below that, the Paragraph Formatting 
Controls button ( ) are located at the left side of the Control panel, and you can use them 
to switch between controls that aff ect either paragraphs or characters. 
Additional character and paragraph formatting options are available through dedicated panels for 
formatting type. You can access these other options by choosing Type > Character, or Type > 
Paragraph.
Changing font and type styles
You can make adjustments to text formatting using the Control panel which you’ll explore 
in this exercise.
1 
Make sure you have the Type tool ( ) selected, then click and drag the text Inside this 
issue: to highlight it so that it is selected. 
The Character Formatting Controls.
In the Control panel at the top of the workspace, make sure the Character Formatting 
Controls icon (A) is selected.
You will change the font by typing the font name to access it more quickly.
Previewing fonts in the Control Panel
When you click the arrow to the right of the font name, the drop-down menu lists all the 
fonts that InDesign is able to access. InDesign has a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you 
get) font menu, which shows the word SAMPLE displayed in the different fonts. Pick any 
font you’d like, just to see the font change.

In the Font drop-down menu in the Control panel, click and drag to select (highlight) 
the font name and type Adobe Garamond Pro. As soon as Adobe Garamond Pro is 
displayed, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to select this font and the text 
is formatted appropriately.
You will now change the type style to bold.
To see how text in your document will appear when using a certain font, fi rst select the text to be 
changed, then click to place the cursor in the Font drop-down menu in the Control panel. With 
the text in the document still selected, use the up- and down-arrows on your keyboard to apply 
diff erent fonts to the text.
3 
With the text still selected, locate the Font Style drop-down menu, under the menu 
where you changed the font in the previous step. Choose Bold from the Font Style 
drop-down menu. Your type now appears as bold Adobe Garamond Pro. Keep the 
text selected.
Use this drop-down menu to set the style of the font, such as bold, italic, or black. 
InDesign only makes available font styles that are installed on your computer. For 
example, if you have Arial, but you don’t have Arial Bold, you can choose Arial, but 
the Bold option will not be available. This avoids possible problems when printing, 
but is diff erent from many other software programs which allow you to apply styles 
such as italic or bold to any font.
Changing the type style to bold.
Adjusting size
You can increase or decrease text size from the Control panel. Here you will increase the 
size of the selected text.
1 
In the Control panel, use the mouse to click and select the font size ( ) and replace it 
by typing 20 and then pressing Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The font size 
increases to 20 points. You can also choose from pre-defi ned sizes in the drop-down 
menu, but entering a specifi c value can be faster if you know the exact size you want. 
Similarly, if the size you want to use isn’t part of the predefi ned sizes, you’ll need to 
enter the value by typing it into the Control panel.

Adjusting line spacing
The space between lines of text is known as leading. Before computers were used to set 
type, original letter presses used bars of lead to separate the lines of type, and so the term 
leading remains, even though it now only requires the click of the mouse instead of 
inserting a piece of metal between the lines of type. Leading is measured from the bottom 
of one line (the “baseline”) to the bottom of the line above it. 
Here you will continue to work on the cover, adjusting the leading for the list of stories 
located below the text you formatted in the previous exercise.
1 
Using the Type tool ( ), click to insert the cursor in the text frame containing the list 
of stories in this issue. To select all the text in the frame click fi ve times, or choose 
Edit > Select All.
2 
In the Control panel, set the Leading ( ) to 16 by selecting the existing value and 
typing 16. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to set the leading. This sets 
the space from the bottom of one line to the bottom of the next at 16 points. Keep the 
text selected as you will continue formatting it in the next part of this exercise.
As with the text size, if you want to use one of the pre-set choices, you can select 
them from the drop-down menu. 
Changing the leading.
Leading controls in InDesign are applied to individual lines of text. To apply line 
spacing to an entire paragraph, select all the text in the paragraph before adjusting the 
leading, or incorporate the leading value in a paragraph style, which you will learn 
about in the next lesson, “Working with Styles.”
Adjusting character spacing: kerning and tracking
Just like you can adjust the space vertically between lines of type, you can also adjust 
the space between either a specifi c pair of characters or between a range of characters. 
Adjusting the space between two characters is kerning, while adjusting the space between 
a range of characters is tracking.
1 
Click to place the cursor in the Tracking value (
) portion of the Control panel, then 
type 10 and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to increase the tracking.
Tracking is measured using a fraction of an em space. A full em space is the width of 
the letter M of a particular font in a particular size—simply put, an em space varies 
depending upon the size and font you are using. In this case, the value 10 represents 
10/1000ths of an em space.
Changing the tracking.

Changing character attributes
Next you will use the word Tech in the lower-left corner of the page to serve as a logo 
for the start of the High Tech Corner section. You will kern the letters closer together, 
and then use baseline shift to further adjust some of the letters to create a visual eff ect 
with the type.
2 
Using the Type tool ( ), click between the e and the c in the word Tech in the same block 
of text where you are currently working. Click to select the kerning value ( ) which is 
currently set to 0 and type -120, being certain to include the minus symbol to indicate a 
negative value. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to set the kerning. 
Changing the kerning.
Using a baseline shift
The baseline is the horizontal line upon which the bottom part of characters rests. Some 
characters, like lowercase q or p fall below the baseline, but most characters sit upon the 
baseline. You can use baseline shift to change the vertical position of individual characters. 
This is useful for trademark and copyright symbols along with fractions and footnotes or 
endnotes. Here you will use baseline shift to style the text to gain an understanding of 
how to access these capabilities using InDesign.
1 
Select the letters e and c of the word Tech and change their size to 10 using the Font 
Size drop-down menu in the Control panel.
2 
Select only the letter e and in the Baseline Shift value ( ) in the Control panel type 
6 pt, and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The e is shifted upward, 
6 points off  the baseline.
Apply the baseline shift to the letter.

Changing paragraph attributes
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
84
Changing paragraph attributes
The text formatting you applied earlier in this lesson impacted only the text you had 
selected. In this part of the lesson, you will work with attributes that are applied to an entire 
paragraph, including text alignment, spacing, and tabs. Because these attributes apply to an 
entire paragraph, you do not need to select any text. Simply placing your cursor within a 
paragraph to be formatted is all that is needed to apply paragraph attributes. The adjustments 
you will be making are found in the paragraph controls section of the Control panel.
Horizontally aligning text 
For most Western languages, text reads from left-to-right, and aligns to the left side of a text 
frame. You can change the alignment of text so that text aligns to the right side of the frame, 
is centered, or aligns along both sides of the frame (justifi ed), or have InDesign adjust the 
alignment depending upon whether the text is on the left or right side of a publication. 
1 
Press the Pages button ( ) to open the Pages panel. Double-click page 2 to navigate to 
it, which also centers this page in the workspace.
2 
On page 2, click anywhere in the line of text that reads Average Cell Phone Usage. You 
don’t need to highlight the line of text; simply place the cursor in this line.
3 
In the Control panel, click the Paragraph Formatting Controls button ( ) to access the 
paragraph portion of the Control panel.
The paragraph formatting controls.
4 
Press the Align Center button ( ) to align the text to the center of the text frame. The 
text is now centered. Keep the cursor in this text.
Changing the spacing before and after paragraphs
Adding space before or after paragraphs makes each paragraph stand out, and creates a 
clear transition between ideas and sections. A common mistake is to apply additional 
returns between paragraphs. Applying additional returns quickly adds space, but the space 
cannot be easily refi ned, or made to be consistent between all paragraphs in a single step. 
Using the space before and space after option provides more control over spacing between 
paragraphs than simply inserting an additional return. 
In this section, you will adjust the spacing between the headline and the list of city names. 
You will start by placing some extra space after the text Average Cell Phone Usage.
1 
Using the Type tool ( ), click anywhere within the line of text that reads Average Cell 
Phone Usage.
2 
In the Control panel, locate the Space After text fi eld ( ), type .0625, and then press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

Lesson 3, Working with Text and Type
Changing paragraph attributes
Using tabs
Tabs, or tab stops, are used to align text and insert space between words or numbers. Tabs are 
inserted into text by pressing the Tab key on the keyboard, and you can then use InDesign 
to specify exactly where the tab stops should be positioned. A common use of tabs is in a 
restaurant menu, where menu items are positioned on the left side of the menu, and prices are 
aligned along the right side of the menu, with a series of periods, or dot leaders, separating 
the menu items from the prices. Similarly, a Table of Contents at the start of a book such 
as this one uses tabs to align page numbers and separate the content from the these page 
numbers. In this exercise, you will use tabs to separate the city name from the average hours 
of cell phone usage.
1 
Using the Type tool ( ), select all the text in the Average Cell Phone Usage text frame 
by clicking in the text frame and choosing Edit > Select All or by clicking fi ve times 
with your mouse in the text frame. 
2 
Choose Type > Show Hidden Characters to see the tab, represented by a (>>). You 
can see that when the text was entered, a tab was placed between the city name 
and the hours. Choose Type > Hide Hidden Characters to hide these non-printing 
characters from view. Next you will specify where the tabs should be positioned using 
the Tabs panel.

Choose Type > Tabs to open the Tabs panel. The Tabs panel appears aligned to the 
top of the selected text frame. 
If the Tabs panel is not aligned to the top of the text frame, use the Zoom tool (( ) to reduce 
the magnifi cation so that the top of the text frame is fully visible within the workspace. After 
reducing the magnifi cation, select the Type tool ( ), click within the text frame, and select all the 
text within the frame. In the right-hand corner of the Tabs panel, click the Position Panel above

InDesign provides four options for aligning tabs. Located at the top-left of the Tabs panel, 
front left to right, are the Left-Justified Tab ( ), Center-Justified Tab ( ), Right-Justified Tab 
( ), and Align to Decimal (or Other Specified Character) Tab ( ) buttons. 
Next to the tab buttons is the X text field which identifies the numerical location of the tab 
in the layout. The Leader text field specifies any characters used between tab stops, such as 
a period placing leader dots between tabbed items in a Table of Contents or a list of menu 
items. The Align On field specifies if a tab aligns on special characters, such as a decimal 
point to align currency values or a colon to align time values. You can also insert and move 
tabs visually rather than using the numerical values. To create a tab visually, click directly 
above the ruler to insert the tab stop, or click and drag an existing tab stop to reposition it. 
The triangles on the left and right sides of the Tabs panel ruler control the left, right, and 
first-line indents for the paragraph where the cursor is located.

Other ways to organize data: Lists and Tables
While this example used tabs to organize the data, there are several other options. You can 
place data in tables. You can also use bulleted or numbered lists which can be accessed from 
the Paragraph controls option of the Control panel. After applying bullets or numbers to a 
list, choose the Bullets ( ) and Numbering ( ) command from the Control panel menu to 
specify the bullet characters to use, any text that should be placed after the bullet, any indent 
that should occur, and any character style to use on the bulleted text.
Another way to organize lists 
of data is using bullets and 
numbering.
Creating hanging indents
An example of a hanging indent, where the fi rst line is aligned to 
the left of all other text within a paragraph.
A hanging indent is created when the first line of the paragraph starts at the left margin, but 
the second and subsequent lines are indented. This is called hanging indentation because the 
first line hangs out over the rest of the paragraph. To make a hanging indent, make your First 
line indent a negative value, and the Left indent a positive value.

Adding rules above or below paragraphs
Rules are horizontal lines placed above or below a paragraph. You can use rules to separate 
paragraphs or call attention to headlines. Rules move with the text to which they are 
attached, making them diff erent from a line you might draw separately and place on the 
page. You will add a rule below the words Average Cell Phone Usage.

In the Off set text fi eld, make sure the off set value is set to 0.0625. This shifts the line 
below the baseline. If the off set is set to 0 it aligns to the baseline, so by giving it a 
positive off set value, the rules is moved down below the baseline for the headline. A 
negative value would shift the rule upward.

Finding and changing text
Finding and changing text automatically can be a big time-saver. You might discover that 
a product name needs to be changed across an entire document, or that a website address 
needs to be located and made italic in every location it is used. In both cases, InDesign’s 
Find/Change feature helps to automate the process. 
Finding and changing text and text attributes
In this exercise you will make the text Tech Magazine bold across the top of each page. 
In Lesson 2, “Building Documents with Master Pages,” you discovered that a master page 
could be used to format and adjust an object that is placed in a consistent location across 
a document. Here we elected to not use a master page, which makes the Find/Change 
feature especially useful.

Lesson 3, Working with Text and Type
Finding and changing text
GREP explained
In the GREP exercises that you performed in this lesson, you may have noticed the 
characters in the Find what and Change to fields. These characters tell InDesign what pattern 
to detect and how to change the text. In the Find what section of the Find/Change window, 
the string of characters starts with the following: 
\(?(\d\d\d)\)?[-. ]
The beginning part of this text string \( is used to search for a specific character when using 
GREP. The backslash is an escape character and it forces GREP to search for the character 
immediately following it. In this case the \( is searching for an open parenthesis.
The question mark ? that follows the open parenthesis indicates that the parenthesis may 
or may not be there. If it exists, GREP acknowledges it and will adjust it based upon your 
instructions. If the search doesn’t turn-up the character being searched for, then GREP 
ignores it. This is like telling InDesign “You may or may not find a left parenthesis.”
The next section (\d\d\d) is looking for three numeric digits in a row. These three digits are 
wrapped in parentheses so that they can be protected when the change is performed. 
The next three characters \)? are similar to the start of the search, except in this case GREP 
is looking for a closing parenthesis that may or may not be there instead of the opening 
parenthesis that was searched for at the start.
Finally, [-. ] looks for a hyphen, a period, or a space. Any one will be acceptable. The 
remainder of the expression is just a repeated variation on the first section.
Now in the Change to field is $1.$2.$3. Each $ followed by a number is a variable. $1 is 
capturing whatever was found in the first section of text that was surrounded by parentheses—
in this case (\d\d\d). So whatever numbers GREP found as those first three digits, it will 
retain in the change expression, keeping the found numbers and the changed numbers the 
same. Any characters can be placed between the groups of $1, $2, and $3 as these represent the 
parts of the phone number. The default option places a period between these groups.

Checking and correcting spelling
Checking spelling is an important part of creating a professional-looking document, and 
InDesign has several options to help you prevent and correct spelling mistakes and simple 
typographical errors. 
The Dynamic Spelling and Autocorrect options alert you to misspelled words and can 
automatically change them for you. In this exercise, you will take a closer look at the 
ability to fi nd and change words across an entire document or group of documents.
Checking spelling
InDesign can help you locate misspelled words, repeated words, uncapitalized words, and 
uncapitalized sentences. 
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click page 2 to center the page in the workspace. 
2 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel, and then click anywhere in the headline 
at the top of page 2 that reads What is the next inovation in cell phones?. 
The word innovation is intentionally misspelled to help you gain an understanding of 
InDesign’s the spell-checking capabilities.
3 
Choose Edit > Spelling > Check Spelling. The Check Spelling dialog box appears.
4 
Select Story from the Search drop-down menu at the bottom of the dialog box so that 
only this text frame is searched. A story is the InDesign term for a text frame and any 
other text frames that are linked to it. The Check Spelling dialog box is displayed.

Editing text using the Story Editor
Sometimes it is easier to view the text separately from the layout. Instead of following text 
across multiple text frames, or across diff erent pages, it can be easier to edit text in one 
window. You can use the Story Editor to more easily work with text in one window, even 
if it is linked across multiple pages or text frames.
The Story Editor also displays text that does not fi t into existing frames, known as overset 
text. Overset text is indicated by a red plus sign that appears at the bottom-right corner of 
a frame when there is more text than fi ts into the frame.

4 
Highlight the overset text and delete it, then close the Story Editor.
While the overset text was simply deleted in this example, there are several other ways in which 
overset text is typically addressed. Making edits to the existing story can create room for the 
text to fi t into the existing text frames. Creating additional space by adding new text frames or 
enlarging the existing frames can also eliminate overset text. Similarly, linking the text to a new 
frame can give the overset text a page onto which it can be displayed. You can also reduce the size 
of the text, decrease the leading, or adjust the tracking so that more text fi ts in the same area.
5 
Notice that the red plus sign at the end of the text frame has disappeared, indicating 
that there is no longer any overset text.

You can also specify that InDesign increases the width or height of columns as you enter 
additional text. Do this in the text frame options by selecting the text frame and choosing 
Object > Text Frame Options and specifying whether you want the text frame to grow in 
height, width, or both as additional text is added to the frame.
Importing text
There are three ways to fl ow text into an InDesign document: You can fl ow text 
manually, and link the text boxes yourself. You can also fl ow text semi-automatically, and 
you can automatically fl ow text into your InDesign document so that new frames and 
pages are created for you.

Flowing text manually 
In this fi rst exercise, you will manually fl ow text and practice threading text between frames.
1 
In the Pages panel, locate and navigate to page 3 by double-clicking the page 3 icon, 
then choose Edit > Deselect All to make certain nothing is selected.
2 
Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the id03lessons folder, select 
the id0301.doc fi le, make sure Show Import Options is checked, and click Open. The 
Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box appears because this text fi le was created 
using Microsoft Word. 
3 
In the Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box, confi rm that the Remove Styles and 
Formatting from Text and Tables option is selected, and directly under this option, that 
Preserve Local Overrides is not checked. Click OK to close the dialog box.
This keeps styles used in the Microsoft Word document from being accidentally 
imported into your InDesign layout.
If you accidentally fl ow text into your previously selected frame, choose Edit > Undo.

A preview of the fi le you are importing is displayed inside the cursor. The cursor 
previews the fi rst few sentences of text being imported. Click just below the headline 
text frame and the imported text from the Microsoft Word document fi lls the column.
Flowing text into a column.
You can also create text frames at the time you import by clicking and dragging with the loaded 
cursor. The size of the frame is determined by how large or small a frame you draw. You can 
also create multiple frames in a single step by pressing the up-arrow on the keyboard to create 
additional frames stacked vertically, or press the right-arrow on the keyboard to split the frames 
horizontally. After pressing the up- or right-arrow you can press the other to split the frames 
again at the time you are creating them, or press the left- or down-arrow to reduce the number 
of frames.

You have successfully placed a story in the fi rst column, but there is more type than 
fi ts into this frame. You can tell this because a red plus sign appears in the bottom-
right corner of the text frame indicating that there is overset text. In the next exercise, 
you will thread the text from this frame to another frame, creating a link where the 
story will continue.
Threading text between frames
You can fl ow text between columns, pages, and between diff erent text frames. At the top-
left corner of a text frame is the In Port, which indicates if text fl ows into the frame from 
another location. At the bottom-right corner is the Out Port which indicates if text fl ows 
to another frame or if there is more text than fi ts within the frame. You will use the Out 
Port to thread it to another frame.

The arrow within the In Port or Out Port indicates that text flows from another frame. With 
a text frame selected, choose View > Show Text Threads to display links connected to the 
selected frame. The arrow shows that text continues in another frame or from another frame, 
depending upon the port. The Out Port may also display a red plus sign (+), indicating that 
there is overset text that does not fit in the frame, or it may be empty, indicating that all text 
fits within this frame.

Move the cursor under the headline to the top-left side of the second column. Click 
and drag from the top-left side of the column down to the bottom-right side of the 
column. The two text frames are now linked because you created the second text 
frame after clicking the out port in the fi rst text frame. 
4 
If the links between the text frames are not showing, choose View > Extras > Show 
Text Threads. InDesign displays the link between the two frames. Choose View > 
Extras > Hide Text Threads to stop displaying the linked frames. Linked frames are 
visible when one of the frames in the link is selected.

Choose File > Save to save your work.
Using semi-autoflow to link several text frames
Clicking the out port for each individual text frame may work on smaller documents, but it is 
not effi  cient for longer documents. Fortunately you can place text into one frame, then move 
to the next frame to continue linking without clicking the out port. This allows you to link 
multiple text frames without needing to click the Out Port of each frame. To achieve this, 
press and hold the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key when importing text into the fi rst 
frame, or after linking text from a text frame, as you will see in the following exercise.
1 
In the Pages panel, double-click the page 4 icon to center the page in the workspace.
2 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel and click anywhere in the 
pasteboard to make sure that there is nothing selected, or choose Edit > Deselect All.

Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the id03lessons folder and select 
the id0302.doc fi le. Deselect the Show Import Options check box, and then click Open.
4 
With the loaded cursor ready to place text, press and hold the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key on your keyboard, and then click in the fi rst column, just below 
the headline. Release the Alt or Option key.
The text fl ows into the fi rst column and the cursor is automatically loaded so you can 
link the fi rst column to another frame without clicking the Out Port.

In the second column, click and drag to draw a new frame below the image of the 
Data Center Server. The text fl ows into the new frame.
You can also have InDesign automatically add columns and pages as needed by pressing and 
holding the Shift key while clicking with a loaded cursor that is ready to fl ow text into your 
layout. When you automatically fl ow text, InDesign creates new frames based on where you click 
inside the margin guides. InDesign automatically generates enough frames to fl ow all the text 
based on the column guides defi ned for each page.
Linking to an existing text frame
If you have an existing frame that you want to link text into, first click the Out Port in the 
frame containing the overset text. Then move the cursor over the existing text frame and 
click anywhere within the frame.

Changing the number of columns in a text frame
You can change the size and shape of a text frame at any time. In this exercise, you will 
make a new text frame, and then resize it.
1 
Choose the Selection tool ( ). Click to select the frame you created in the previous 
exercise, located on the right side of the page below the image. Press the Delete key to 
delete only this frame. The fi rst column displays the symbol for overset text.
2 
Continuing to use the Selection tool, click to select the text frame in the fi rst column. 
Move the cursor to the right side of the frame and locate the white dot located at the 
halfway point of the right side of the frame. The white dot is a handle. Click, hold, 
and drag the handle to the right. As you drag the handle, the column expands so that 
it overlaps the picture and extends to the right side of the page.
Release the mouse when the text spans the entire width of the page. You will divide 
this single text frame into two columns.
3 
Choose the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel. In the Paragraph Formatting Options 
section of the Control panel, type 2 for the number of columns ( ), then press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
4 
Continuing to work in the Paragraph Formatting Options section of the Control 
panel, type .167 in in the gutter fi eld ( ), which sets the distance between the 
columns. Press Enter/Return.

Flexible columns
You can have InDesign determine the number of columns that are needed in a text frame 
rather than specifying an exact number of columns, and InDesign can even determine the 
width of the columns. Do this by selecting a text frame and then choosing Object > Text 
Frame Options. In the Text Frame Options dialog box, choose one of the following options 
from the Columns drop-down menu to have InDesign automatically determine the number 
of columns to fit into a text frame:
Fixed Width causes InDesign to generate as many columns as fit into the text frame, with all 
text frames maintaining a specified width.
Flexible Width causes InDesign to create columns that fit between the minimum and 
maximum size you specify for the columns. If the text frame becomes larger, the columns 
will be made larger until they reach their maximum size—at which point a new column will 
be added.

Spanning and splitting columns
You can specify that text in a layout span across columns that are part of a text frame. You 
could use for a headline, or you could also split a text column into additional columns. You 
can control spanning or splitting of columns in the Paragraph controls portion of the control 
panel.
Text can span across columns or 
be split into additional columns.

Baseline grid
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
120
Baseline grid
If you create documents with multiple columns, you can use the baseline grid to align the 
text across the diff erent columns. In this part of the lesson, you will display the baseline 
grid, change the grid settings, and align the text to the baseline grid.
Viewing and changing the baseline grid
1 
To view the baseline grid, choose View > Grids & Guides > Show Baseline Grid. 
The baseline grid guides may not be visible when viewing the document at a magnifi cation less 
than 100 percent. If the baseline grid is not displaying after selecting the Show Baseline Grid 
command, increase the magnifi cation at which you are viewing the document.
The baseline grid displays horizontal lines across the page 
at increments you can defi ne. You can specify that text 
aligns to the grid lines.
If you plan to have text align to the baseline grid, the grid should be spaced at least at 
the value as used for leading for the body copy. Defi ning the leading values for text 
was discussed earlier in this lesson. In this exercise, you will adjust the spacing for the 
document’s baseline grid.
2 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel and click in the body text in either of the 
columns on page 4.

In the Control panel, press the Character Formatting Controls button (A); notice that 
the Leading ( ) is set to 14.4 pt. You will use this this value for the baseline grid, 
which is controlled using the Baseline Grid Preferences.
4 
Choose Edit > Preferences > Grids (Windows), or InDesign > Preferences > Grids 
(Mac OS). In the Baseline Grid section of the Grids Preferences dialog box, type 
14.4 pt in the Increment Every text fi eld. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box. 
Although this step establishes the value for the grid, you have not yet specifi ed that the 
text needs to align to the grid. In the next part of this exercise, you will align the text 
to the baseline grid.
Specifying the spacing for the baseline grid.
5 
Making certain that the cursor is still in the body text, choose Edit > Select All, then 
press the Paragraph Formatting Controls button ( ) in the Control panel. 
6 
In the Control panel, press the Align to Baseline Grid button (
). The selected text 
in both columns aligns to the baseline grid. Aligning to the baseline grid is defi ned on 
a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, which is why the diff erent paragraphs needed to be 
selected before specifying the text should align to the grid.

Adding story jumps
If you create documents with text that fl ows from one page to another, you will want to 
direct the reader to the location where a story continues. Rather than manually entering 
the page number where each story continues, InDesign makes it easy to automatically tell 
your readers where stories continue. 
You will use a page marker on page 2 of this document, helping readers to see that a 
story continues on page 5. We’ve created text frames for you to enter the marker that 
will specify where the text continues. In this exercise, you will enter in the marker that 
automatically refl ects where text continues and see how InDesign displays the linked page 
information.
1 
In the Pages panel, navigate to page 2 by double-clicking the page 2 icon.
2 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel and place the cursor in the text frame 
located in the lower-right corner of page 2, directly after the words “Please see page”.
3 
Press the spacebar once to put a space between the word “page” and the marker you 
will insert to specify where the story continues.
4 
Choose Type > Insert Special Character > Markers > Next Page Number. This 
marker displays the number 5. For the page marker to function, the text frame 
containing the marker needs to be touching a text frame that fl ows to another text 
frame on a diff erent page. Now you will add the page marker on page 5, specifying 
where the story originates. 
The text frame with the Next Page marker.
5 
In the lower-left corner of the workspace, click the page drop-down menu to navigate 
to page 5. You can use this method or use the Pages panel if you prefer to navigate to 
page 5 in the layout.
6 
Using the Type tool, place the cursor after the words From page.
7 
Press the spacebar to put a space between the words and the marker. 
8 
Choose Type > Insert Special Character > Markers > Previous Page Number. The 
number 2 appears because the text in the adjacent frame is linked from page 2.

Linked stories and collected content
You can take the text in one part of an InDesign document and link it to another part of the 
same document or to a different document altogether. This can be useful if you are using 
InDesign to create multiple versions of a document, such as a brochure and a data sheet that 
both describe the same item. Similarly, you can create one layout for print and another for a 
digital version of a document. To link a story in an InDesign document, follow these steps:
1 
Using the Type tool, place the cursor anywhere within a text frame that contains text. 
Make sure the document has been saved.
2 
Choose Edit > Place and Link. You can also use the Content Collector tool ( ), located 
in the Tools panel, to gather linked content.
3 
Move the cursor to the page where you want the text to be repeated and click. This can 
be in the same document or in a diff erent InDesign document. If you used the Content 
Collector tool to gather the content to be linked, then use the Content Placer tool ( ) to 
place the content into the same or a diff erent InDesign document.
If you make changes to the original text or object that has been collected, the linked frames 
indicate that the original has changed by displaying a yellow triangle in the upper-left corner 
of the frame. Double-click this triangle or use the Links panel to display the most recent 
version of the file. While this example illustrates text being used, other objects such as images 
can be collected and linked across various InDesign layouts. 
Using styles to format text
Styles save time when you’re working with text that shares the same look and feel across 
a document. If you decide that your body text should be a diff erent size or font, styles let 
you make the change in one location, avoiding the need to make changes on every page. 
Additionally, styles make it easy to keep a consistent design, as you can use styles to apply 
multiple text attributes in a single click. A more complete discussion of styles occurs in the 
next lesson, Lesson 4, “Working with Styles.”
Creating a headline and applying a style
In this exercise, you will create a style and apply it to a headline.

If a plus sign appears next to the style name, press and hold the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key and select the style name again. This removes any formatting 
changes that have been made since the style was applied. 
Changes made to text after a style has been applied are known as overrides. If you edit a style 
attribute outside the Paragraph Styles panel, the style is manually overridden, and a plus sign 
displays next to the style name in the styles panel. If you place your cursor over the style in the 
Paragraph Styles panel without clicking, and pause, a tooltip appears. The tooltip identifi es 
which attribute is causing the override.

6 
In the Paragraph Styles panel notice that a plus sign (+) is displayed next to the style 
name. This plus sign indicates that the style was changed after it was applied to this 
text. You changed the text by aligning it to the baseline grid—something that was not 
part of the original style defi nition. Next you will change the style so it includes this 
change as part of the defi nition of this style, and all text using this style will include 
this modifi cation.

handles that appear directly to the left of where you clicked on the path. These are 
handles and they mark the starting and ending points for the text on the path. 
8 
Select the left-most vertical handle that appears along the path and drag it clockwise, 
stopping when the line is centered between the top and bottom half on the right side 
of the oval—where the 3 o’clock location would be on a clock. If the text moves so 
that it is placed inside the oval as you are moving the handle, choose Edit > Undo 
and repeat the process, carefully following the oval as you drag clockwise. Be careful 
to not click the boxes when you move the handles, as these boxes are the In and Out 
Ports, which are used for fl owing text into and out of the path.
9 
Take the handle that marks the starting point of the text and drag it counterclockwise, 
positioning it so it is centered along the left half of the oval—where the 9 o’clock

You’ve already seen that you can import text from Microsoft Word documents into your 
InDesign layouts. When importing text from Microsoft Word, InDesign uses the Remove 
Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables option to automatically eliminate styles applied to 
the text using Microsoft Word. You can also have the styles imported or even converted to 
styles you’ve set-up in your InDesign layout, as you’ll discover in this exercise.

About Microsoft Word import options
Any Table of Contents text, index text, footnotes, and endnotes can be brought from a 
Microsoft Word document into an InDesign layout. By default, the Use Typographer’s Quotes 
option is checked, which changes all quotes to typographer’s (curly) quotes. This means that 
every inch- and foot-mark quote will be converted as well. 
If the Remove Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables radio button is selected, all text will 
be imported and formatted using the default Paragraph style, which is usually the Basic 
Paragraph style. If you want to keep all the character attributes that were applied in Microsoft 
Word, select the Preserve Local Overrides check box.
If you select the Preserve Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables radio button, the styles 
created in Word are imported into your document, and the text adopts the imported styles, 
trying to mimic the styles from Word. However, if you create a template in Word that 
contains styles with the same names as the styles in your InDesign document, there will be 
paragraph style conflicts upon importing, and the imported text will use InDesign’s style 
definition by default. This means that, regardless of how text looked in Word, once imported 
into InDesign, the text is formatted with InDesign’s styles. This only occurs if the Microsoft 
Word document and the InDesign document have styles with identical names.

Missing fonts
Missing fonts
Fonts, like graphics, are not embedded within an InDesign document. If you receive 
an InDesign document from a colleague, you may need the fonts that they used when 
creating the document if you don’t have them installed on your computer. In this exercise, 
you will import text from a Microsoft Word document that uses a font that you may not 
have installed on your computer, and you will discover how to address errors that are 
displayed when fonts are not available.
By default, InDesign highlights missing fonts in pink within a layout to alert you to the fact that 
the font being displayed is not the same as what was used when the text was originally formatted.

If you have a font that doesn’t have the style of italic, can you make it italic?
2 
Can you fl ow text into an existing frame?
3 
Can you divide one text frame into multiple columns?
4 
How can you add Previous and Next page markers?
5 
What is the best way to see changes that have been made to text in a given story?
Answers
1 
No, you cannot create a false italic style using InDesign. You need the actual font 
with the italic style to make this change, which is also true for other styles, including 
bold or outline. One exception to this is the ability to apply a skew or false italic using 
the Skew button ( ) in the Character formatting panel. Although this is possible, it’s 
typically not recommended because it is not a true italic font.
2 
Yes, you can fl ow text into existing frames, including frames that already contain text.
3 
Yes, you can have many columns in a single frame. You make column adjustments in 
the Control panel or by choosing Object > Text Frame Options.

Lesson 4, Working with Styles
Lesson 4
Styles make it easy to create consistent designs across text and 
objects. Styles also help you simplify adjustments to the formatting 
of text and objects. By using styles, you can update text or objects 
across an entire document in a single step.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in the Starting up 
section of this book.
In this lesson, you will work with several fi les from the id04lessons folder in this lesson. 
Make sure that you have copied the id04lessons folder onto your hard drive from the 
included DVD. See “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. This 
lesson may be easier to follow if the id04lessons folder is on your desktop.

The project
You will use paragraph, character, and object styles to enhance the appearance of a two-page 
recipe layout and gain an understanding of how Styles make the design process more effi  cient. 
Creating styles saves a signifi cant amount of time and eff ort as you design and format your 
document. If you need to make changes to text or objects, styles make it a quick and easy 
process to update 10 or 10,000 objects that share similar formatting attributes. The initial 
set-up may take a few minutes when using styles, yet the time savings in the long-run are 
signifi cant.
In this lesson you will also discover how to import styles from other documents, re-using 
the design work from these other documents, and keeping a consistent identity across 
multiple fi les. You will also learn how to organize your styles using style sets, keeping them 
organized, and you’ll also fi nd tips for quickly and effi  ciently applying styles to documents.
Style types
There are several types of styles you can use when designing your documents, including 
paragraph, character, object, GREP, table, and cell styles. Each type of style applies to 
diff erent page elements. These styles speed up the process of formatting and changing 
the appearance of text and page elements, and are especially helpful when working with 
longer documents. You’ll work with these types of styles when using InDesign: 
• Paragraph styles defi ne text attributes that aff ect an entire paragraph of text, including 
line spacing (leading), indents, and alignment. Paragraph styles may also include 
character attributes such as font family and size that apply to an entire paragraph. 
Paragraph styles are commonly used for headlines and body copy.
• Character styles contain character formatting attributes, such as font family, size, and 
color. These attributes are only applied to a specifi ed range of text. Character styles are 
commonly used for single words or numbers that must be formatted diff erently within a 
paragraph, such as a proper name, technical terms, or numbers used in a list.
• Object styles apply to page elements such as boxes and lines. For example, sidebars 
containing text or image frames can be made to look consistent across a layout using 
object styles.
• GREP styles are used to format specifi c content within a paragraph. For example, 
using a GREP style, you can fi nd a text pattern such as a phone number, and format it so 
the area code or country code is a diff erent color.
• Table and Cell styles apply formatting to portions of a table. This lesson is focused 
primarily on using paragraph, character, and object styles, and table styles are covered in 
detail in the Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom book.
In this lesson, you will create customized style defi nitions and share the styles between 
diff erent InDesign documents, defi ning the formatting one time, and reusing the 
formatting across multiple InDesign fi les. You will also explore how to create default styles 
that are available within all new documents you create.

Lesson 4, Working with Styles
Paragraph styles
Paragraph styles
Paragraph styles generally include attributes for both characters and paragraphs. When 
applying a paragraph style, all text within the paragraph is formatted in a single click, 
specifying the font, size, alignment, spacing, and other text attributes. InDesign identifi es 
a paragraph by locating paragraph returns entered using your keyboard, and even a single 
word on a line by itself can be considered a paragraph. In this lesson, you’ll start by 
defi ning a style, and then applying it to text.
Defining paragraph styles
When building styles, it is useful to see what the style will look like when it is applied. 
You can format a paragraph to your liking, and then use the formatting you’ve defi ned 
as the foundation to create a style that can be reused. You’ll start by building a paragraph 
style for the body text used in a cookie recipe.
1 
Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the id04lessons folder and 
select the id0401.indd fi le. Click Open. A two-page spread from a cookbook opens, 
displaying pages 72 and 73. The pages displayed are listed in the lower-left corner of 
your document window and also in the Pages panel.
2 
Choose Advanced from the workspace switcher drop-down menu, or choose 
Window > Workspace > Advanced, then choose Window > Workspace > Reset 
Advanced to reset the InDesign panels to their default positions for the Advanced 
workspace. This ensures that your panels are in position, making them easier to locate 
during this lesson.
3 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the id04lessons folder

Lesson 4, Working with Styles
Paragraph styles
Applying paragraph styles 
You can now apply the new paragraph style to paragraphs in this document. You can 
apply the style to individual paragraphs, or multiple paragraphs. Here you will apply the 
formatting to all the paragraphs in this text frame.
1 
With the cursor still within the recipe, click once in the second paragraph. Do not 
select the text, simply placing the cursor in the paragraph is all that is needed.
2 
In the Paragraph Styles panel, select the body style to apply the style to the second 
paragraph. The style applies to the entire paragraph where the cursor is located, even 
though the text is not selected. 
3 
With the cursor still within the recipe, choose Edit > Select All, or use the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac OS), to select all the text in the frame. 
4 
In the Paragraph Styles panel, select the body style to apply the style to all selected 
text. The entire recipe now uses the same character and paragraph formatting as the 
initial paragraph you formatted.
Format all the text within the text frame with 
the body style.
To format an individual paragraph, use the Type tool to click within the paragraph to be 
formatted, then click the style to be applied in the Paragraph styles panel. When applying 
formatting to a single paragraph, you only need to insert the cursor within the paragraph to be 
formatted, and do not need to select the entire paragraph.

Character styles
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
142
Character styles
Building character styles is similar to the process you used for creating paragraph styles in 
the previous exercise. You’ll start by formatting text, and then you’ll defi ne the character 
style based upon the attributes of the text you have formatted. Character styles aff ect only 
character attributes, such as font and size. Character styles are typically used for words that 
need special treatment, such as bold, italics, or a unique font, and character styles only 
apply to text that you have selected.
Defining character styles
On the right page of the document you will make the text bold at the start of each step. 
You’ll format the fi rst step, and then defi ne a style to apply to the others.
1 
On page 73 of the recipe layout, use the Type tool ( ) to double-click and highlight 
the word Create located under the Yield section.
2 
Press the Character Format Controls button (A) in the Control panel, and then choose 
Bold from the Font Style drop-down menu. Keep the text selected.
Use the character portion of the Control panel to set the type style.
3 
Press the Character Styles button ( ) in the dock on the right side of the workspace to 
open the Character Styles panel.

Lesson 4, Working with Styles
Character styles
5 
In the New Character Style dialog box, type Bold in the Style name text fi eld. Note 
that the only attribute being defi ned by this style in the Style Settings section is 
“bold.” This is because the Bold attribute is the only diff erence from the paragraph 
style that is also applied to this text. This style can be applied to any text using any 
font to apply the bold style of that font family. Click OK to create a new style. The 
new style name appears in the Character Styles panel.
Bold is the only attribute being defi ned in the character style because that is the only attribute 
that is diff erent from the paragraph style that is applied to the text.

Using nested styles
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
144
3 
Highlight the phrase Mix dry ingredients and apply the Bold style by selecting it in the 
Character Styles panel.
When both character and a paragraph styles are applied to the same text, the attributes defi ned 
in the character style take precedence over the attributes defi ned in the paragraph style. In this 
exercise, the Bold attribute of the character style is applied even though the rec_steps paragraph 
style is applied and uses the Regular attribute.
Using nested styles
Nested styles combine character styles with paragraph styles, so you can apply both 
character and paragraph styles in a single step. For example, you can use a nested style to 
make the fi rst word of a paragraph bold and blue, while the rest of the paragraph is regular 
and black.
In this exercise, you will create a nested style by modifying one of the existing paragraph 
styles so it also includes a character style for the initial portion of the paragraph.
1 
Using the Type tool ( ), click in the bottom paragraph on the right page, which 
starts with the text, Bake in oven. If you closed the Paragraph Styles panel, click the 
Paragraph Styles button to open it, or choose Type > Paragraph Styles.
2 
In the Paragraph Styles panel, double-click the rec_steps style to open the Paragraph 
Style Options dialog box for this style.
3 
Select the Drop Caps and Nested Styles option along the left side of the Paragraph Style 
Options dialog box, then click the New Nested Style button. A new nested style is 
added to the nested style section of this dialog box.
4 
In the Nested Styles section’s drop-down menu, choose Bold to select the character 
style you created in the previous exercise. Keep the dialog box open, and next you 
will specify the characters to which the Bold style will be applied.

Updating styles
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
146
Updating styles
You have applied multiple attributes to text in a single click using styles. Next you will 
see how Styles save time when changing or updating formatting, making it easier to keep 
your text consistent across your documents. You will update all text associated with a style 
by modifying the style defi nition. Here you will change the size of the recipe steps. By 
making a single update, all text using the rec_steps style will be updated. Although you 
are working with two pages in this example, the same time-saving technique works just as 
easily on documents with 10 or 100 pages.
1 
Continuing to use the Type tool ( ), click in the bottom paragraph on the right page, 
which starts with the text, Bake in oven.
2 
In the Paragraph Styles panel, the rec_steps paragraph style is highlighted, indicating 
that the style is applied to this paragraph. Double-click the style to open the Paragraph 
Style Options dialog box.
3 
Click to select Basic Character Formats on the left side of the Paragraph Style Options 
dialog box.

With the document open, choose Load All Text Styles from the Paragraph Styles 
panel menu (
). The Open a File dialog box appears.
If you only want to use paragraph or character styles from another document, you 
can choose to load only these styles by selecting either Load Paragraph Styles or Load 
Character Styles from the respective panel menus. For this example, you are importing 
all styles created in another document.

Questions
1 
What is the diff erence between character and paragraph styles?
2 
What is a nested style and why is it used?
3 
What is the keyboard shortcut to access the Quick Apply option?
4 
If there are multiple styles in a document and scrolling becomes tedious, how can you 
organize the styles?
Answers
1 
Paragraph styles apply to all text between paragraph returns, while character styles 
apply only to selected text. Character styles do not include paragraph attributes such as 
indenting, alignment, or tabs.
2 
A nested style is a paragraph style that also includes one or more character styles, that 
formats specifi c areas of a paragraph style. Nested styles allow you to combine multiple 
formatting steps into a single click.
3 
You can apply the Quick Apply option by pressing Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or 
Command+Return (Mac OS).
4 
You can use style groups to organize your styles. They allow you to group together 
styles and determine which styles are displayed or hidden.

The project
In this lesson, you will work on a fi ctional travel magazine called SoJournal, adding 
graphics to the layout using diff erent techniques. You will learn how to resize graphics, 
precisely change positioning, set display quality, and wrap text around graphics. You will 
also learn how to manage graphics that have been updated, replaced, or are missing.
Understanding how InDesign handles graphics
When you place a graphic into an InDesign layout, the graphic fi le remains a separate fi le. 
Imported images or illustrations are not embedded into the InDesign document, so both 
the separate graphic fi les and the InDesign document are necessary for printing, archiving, 
or sharing your document with collaborators who might need to otherwise manipulate 
the original fi les. InDesign keeps track of graphic fi les used in your InDesign documents 
using the Links panel, as image fi les are considered to be linked. This is diff erent from 
text fi les that are imported from programs like Microsoft Word or Excel. Text fi les are 
placed into the InDesign layout, and the original fi le is no longer needed to manipulate 
the text. For every rule there are exceptions, and graphic fi les can be embedded within 
an InDesign layout—although this is generally not advisable because it increases the size 
of the InDesign document and limits the ability to share a graphic for use in other media, 
such as on the Web or as part of an interactive campaign.
You’ll start this lesson by opening a document where images have been imported, but 
InDesign can no longer locate the image fi les. You will help InDesign locate the missing fi les.
Locating missing images
If an image is renamed or moved from its original location after you import it into an 
InDesign fi le, InDesign loses the link to the image. Likewise, if you copy an InDesign 
document to a diff erent computer, and don’t transfer the images, InDesign will alert you 
that linked fi les are missing.
You’ll use the Links panel and a new feature in InDesign CS6 called the Link badge to 
reconnect the InDesign layout with a missing image. In the Links panel, and in the Link 
badge indicator located in the upper-left corner of a graphics frame, missing links display 
a Red Warning icon ( ) next to their names, and links that have been modifi ed or edited 
since they were originally placed in the layout, display a Yellow Warning Icon (
), 
indicating that the original image was modifi ed. In this exercise, you will fi x a link that 
was broken because the associated fi les were moved, and also fi x a link to a graphic in the 
layout that was modifi ed or changed.

Lesson 5, Working with Graphics
Working with the Links panel and the Link badge
1 
Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the id05lessons folder 
and select id0501.indd. Click Open. As the fi le opens, InDesign displays a message 
informing you that the document contains links to missing or modifi ed fi les. 
2 
Click the Don’t Update Links button to open the document without updating the links. 
When opening a fi le with missing or modifi ed links, you can choose Update Links 
to help reconnect the linked image fi les with the InDesign layout.
Depending on which workspace you have active, the Links panel will display in the 
middle of your screen or on the right side of the screen in the panel dock. Notice the 
citytravel.psd fi le displays a Red Warning icon—indicating that the link is missing—
while the id0507.psd fi le displays the Yellow Warning symbol—indicating that the 
link has been modifi ed or changed since it was placed into the layout. In the next part 
of the lesson, you will work with the Links panel to discover how to update image 
fi les that are missing or modifi ed.
When using the Update Links option, any other broken links located in the folder are also 
updated when you update the fi rst linked item. For example, if an entire folder containing images 
is relocated, you can update the link to all the missing items using the Update Links option, 
eliminating the need to update multiple broken links individually. You can also use the Relink to 
folder command from the Links panel menu. 
3 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the id05lessons folder and 
type id0501_work.indd in the File name text fi eld. Click Save and keep the fi le open.
Working with the Links panel and the Link badge
When you import an image into your layout, InDesign doesn’t copy the complete 
image into your document fi le. Instead, it saves a reference, or a link, to the location 
of the original graphic fi le so it can access the image when necessary. This process lets 
you import many fi les into your layout without signifi cantly increasing the fi le size of 
the document. For example, you can create a catalog with hundreds of images, but the 
InDesign document remains a small fi le with many linked images.
Because graphic fi les are generally linked, and not embedded within the InDesign fi le, you 
need to know how to manage linked graphic fi les. The Links panel and the Link badge let 
you manage these links, fi nd fi les in the document, fi nd missing fi les, and update graphics

Select the id0507.psd link in the Links panel and click the Go To Link button (
) 
at the bottom of the Links panel. InDesign navigates to the location of the modifi ed 
image in the document.
One of the new features in InDesign CS6 is the addition of a Link badge that appears 
in the upper-left corner of a linked frame. Notice that the link that you just navigated 
to contains the Modifi ed Link icon ( ) in the upper-left corner of the frame.
The Link badge is a real-time display of the link status of an image within a frame.
5 
If you hover your cursor over the Link badge, you’ll see a tooltip that gives you 
instructions for using the Link badge. Click the Link badge once with your cursor and 
notice that the link updates immediately. Press Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click 
(Mac OS) on the Link badge to open the Links panel with the link selected.

Adding graphics to your layout
You can add graphics that are created using a number of diff erent programs or use a variety 
of graphic fi le types, such as JPEG, EPS, PSD, TIFF, AI, and many others. InDesign 
lets you import native Photoshop, PDF, and Illustrator fi les into your layouts. You can 
also import other InDesign documents (.indd format) into your layouts. In all, InDesign 
supports more than a dozen graphic fi le formats.
The most common way to add graphics to your InDesign layouts is to use the Place 
command, located under the File menu. In this exercise, you’ll use the Place command to 
add an image to the front page of your travel magazine. 
You can also import movies and audio in QuickTime, .avi, .wav, .aif, and .swf formats, as well 
as .au sound clips, into InDesign. These can be exported to the PDF and SWF fi le formats.

Choose File > Save to save your work. Keep the fi le open for the next part of the lesson.
Fitting options
You can use several options to get images to fit correctly to the frames on your page, 
including the following:
Object > Fitting > Fill Frame Proportionally causes the smallest size to become larger or 
smaller to fit within the frame, eliminating any additional space around the edge of the frame.
Object > Fitting > Fit Content Proportionally resizes the image to fit inside the frame, 
maintaining the original image proportions. If the proportions of the box do not match the 
proportions of the image, extra space will display around one or more of the frame edges.
Object > Fitting > Fit Frame to Content causes the frame to snap to the edges of the 
image. The frame either reduces or enlarges to fit the exact size of the image.
Be careful when using Fit Content to Frame, because it distorts the image to fit the frame. 
The proportional options are generally a better choice for most images.
Object > Fitting > Center Content centers the graphic or image within the graphic frame.
These options are also available from the context menu, either by right-clicking (Windows) 
or Control+clicking (Mac OS) with the mouse.
Fitting an image within an existing frame
You will now explore options for controlling where graphics are placed within your layout 
and how the graphics fi t within their respective frames.

the frame until the image is relatively centered in the frame.
While dragging the image, a light-brown bounding box appears around the edge of 
the image that is outside the cropping area, and InDesign also displays any part of the 
image that is cropped by the frame. This “live” screen drawing is an improved feature 
in InDesign that allows you to see the entire image as you drag it, “ghosting” the 
image where it is being cropped by the frame.
When clicking and dragging an image with the Direct Selection tool, InDesign displays the complete size, 
even any part outside of the frame.
5 
Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) the graphic and choose Fitting > 
Center Content. The image is centered within the frame.
6 
Using the Selection tool, right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) the

Using Adobe Bridge to import graphics
Adobe Bridge is a separate application that ships with InDesign. It provides a way to 
manage and view your digital assets, including images and InDesign documents. You can 
use Bridge to get previews of your documents, and view information about fi les before 
you even open them. Bridge works like a specialized version of your operating system for 
managing and arranging the fi les you import into an InDesign layout, and fi les you have 
created using InDesign.
In this section, you will import an image into the document by dragging it from the 
Bridge window directly into the InDesign document.
1 
With id0501_work.indd still open, choose File > Browse in Bridge, or click the Go to 
Bridge button ( ) in the Application Bar to launch Adobe Bridge.

the upper-right corner of the Bridge window (Mac OS). Click anywhere within the 
InDesign document window to make it active; then choose File > Save.
Placing multiple graphics using Mini Bridge
With InDesign, you can place multiple graphics into your InDesign layouts in a single 
step using the Mini Bridge panel. Mini Bridge off ers features found in the Adobe Bridge 
application, but is built into Adobe InDesign as a panel. This alleviates the need to view 
images on your computer using a completely separate application. In this section, you will 
place two graphics in the remaining frames on page 2 of the layout.

Adjusting the display quality of images
InDesign typically provides a low-resolution preview of placed graphics. The higher-
resolution information is not displayed, as the high-quality information is often unnecessary 
for layout, and displaying many high-quality images can slow the performance of InDesign.
You may need to view the high-quality images, and you can choose to display high-quality 
image data for specific images, or for all images. 
To change the display quality of an individual image, right-click (Windows) or 
Control+click (Mac OS) and choose Display Performance. Choose Fast Display to display a 
gray box instead of the image preview. Choose Typical to display a medium resolution for the 
image and choose High Quality display to show the high-resolution image information—the 
same data you would see in programs like Photoshop or Illustrator. 
To change the display performance for all images in a document, choose View > Display 
Performance and select the desired quality level to use for the document.
Using object styles for images
In Lesson 4, “Working with Styles,” you applied object styles to frames. You can also apply 
object styles to frames that contain images, quickly giving them a consistent, fi nished 
appearance. In this exercise, you’ll create and apply an object style that adds a black stroke 
and applies rounded corners to all the frames on page 2.

Wrapping text around images
Wrapping text around images
To force text away from graphics, and cause the text to wrap around the shape of the graphic, 
you can use text wrap to determine how far text should be pushed away from an object.
Wrapping text around the bounding box
When you place a graphic on a page, you might want the text to wrap around the frame 
that contains the graphic.
1 
With the Selection tool ( ), select the image of Athens on page 2. Click, hold, and drag 
it to the right so the upper-left corner of the image fi ts into the corner where the top 
and left margins intersect. Part of the image overlaps the text because the image frame 
is positioned above the text frame at the half-inch mark.
2 
Move the remaining three photos to the right so that the left edge of the frame is 
aligned with the left margin of the page. Holding down the Shift key while moving 
these frames will constrain their movement horizontally.
Move the image to the intersection of the top and left margins.
3 
Make sure that the fi rst image of Athens is currently selected.

the middle of the off set values is selected. Click the up-arrow, next to any one of the 
off set options, twice to set the off set to 0.125 inches. The text is positioned at least 
.125 inches away from the image frame.
7 
Click the Object Styles button to display the Object Styles panel. Notice that the 
Object Style Image Frame that was applied to this image in the previous exercise 
contains a plus sign next to it. This indicates that a change has been made to the 
selected object beyond what the Object Style defi nes. If you don’t see this, verify that 
you have the frame selected with your Selection tool ( ). Right-click the Image Frame 
object style and choose Redefi ne Style. This applies the changes made to the object 
to the Object style, and the remaining three images on the page update to refl ect the 
updated Object style and now have the text wrap applied as well.
8 
Choose File > Save to save your work. Keep the fi le open for the next exercise.
Using graphics with clipping paths and alpha channels
Some images contain clipping paths or alpha channels. Clipping paths and alpha channels can 
be used to hide information in an image, typically the background, enabling users to wrap 
text around part of the image. Clipping paths are stored in the Paths panel in Photoshop, and 
alpha channels are saved selections stored in the Channels panel in Photoshop. 
The formats that utilize paths and channels include .psd, .eps, and .tif. These formats can 
hide parts of the image that are outside the path or channel when they are used in an 
InDesign layout. You will add a graphic to your layout that contains a clipping path from 
Photoshop, and then use the text wrap option to wrap text around the object’s shape. You 
will place the next image in the Transportation article on page 3 of the InDesign document.

Using anchored objects
Anchored objects, sometimes called inline objects, allow a graphic to follow text that 
relates to the image. For example, if you are creating a dictionary and have an image 
associated with an entry, you want the image to move with the defi nition. If the text 
moves, the image should move with the text.
Anchoring an object attaches it to the associated text. When the text moves, the object 
moves with the text. In this exercise, you will explore how to create anchored objects 
using the skills you have already learned to place images and text.

a specifi c location within text. Click the blue box and drag to the beginning of the 
word Chicago within the text.

5
193
Lesson 5, Working with Graphics
Wrapping text around images
Notice that an anchor now appears in the upper-right corner of the image frame 
indicating that it is anchored to the text. To see the exact location where the image is 
anchored, choose View > Extras > Show Text Threads.
Drag the blue box from the image to a location in the text to easily create an anchored object.
5 
Switch to the Type tool ( ), click to position the text cursor at the end of the paragraph 
in the line above the word Chicago, and then press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) one time. The text moves down, and the graphic moves with the text.
The anchored image moves with its text.
InDesign has made the process of creating anchored objects quite easy, and allows

> Anchored Object > Options. The Anchored Object Options dialog box appears.
8 
In the Anchored Object Options dialog box, click to select the Preview check box in 
the lower-left corner. Choose Custom from the Position drop-down menu, and click 
the Relative to Spine check box. This causes the image position to remain consistent to 
the spine of the document if pages are added or deleted, and the page on which it is 
placed refl ows.
Notice that the image remains linked to the text. If the text position changes, the 
image will continue to fl ow with the text. Leave all the other settings at their defaults, 
and then click OK to close the dialog box.
Set the anchored image to Custom and Relative to Spine to place the

To test the spine-sensitive options, choose View > Fit Spread In Window. Use the 
Selection tool to select the City Art frame. Drag the frame to the empty column on 
the right side of the City Music box on Page 5. Notice that the graphic automatically 
adjusts its position within the City Art box relative to the spread’s spine. Likewise, if 
the text fl owed from a left page to a right page, the anchored object would reposition 
itself automatically.
When you reposition the City Art frame to Page 5, the graphic adjusts its position relative to the spine.
10 Press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS) to undo the repositioning of the 
text frame, or drag the City Art frame back to its original position. 
11 Save the fi le by choosing File > Save. Keep the fi le open for the next part of the lesson.
Applying a text wrap to anchored graphics is the same as applying a text wrap to any object. 
Click the anchored graphic with the Selection tool, choose the desired option from the Text Wrap 
panel, and set your off set value accordingly. One limitation of applying text wrap to anchored 
objects is that the wrap will not apply to the line of text in which the graphic is anchored. In 
addition, Object Styles can be created and applied to inline graphics for consistent positioning of 
Anchored Objects in your document.

Advanced importing
You can import more advanced graphics into your layouts, including Photoshop fi les that 
use layers, and InDesign documents, without converting them to any other fi le type. Even 
if you don’t work extensively with Photoshop, you can still follow along with these steps.
Importing layered Photoshop files 
In this exercise, you’ll work with an imported Photoshop fi le that uses a group of layers that 
have been organized using a layer comp. Layer comps are a snapshot of the current state of 
the Photoshop Layers panel. Within Photoshop, you can change the visibility, position, and 
appearance of the layers to create diff erent versions of a fi le. When you create a layer comp, 
it saves these settings by remembering the state of each layer at the time the layer comp was 
saved. You can use layer comps to create multiple compositions from a single Photoshop fi le. 
When you import a .psd document into InDesign and select the Show Import Options check 
box, you can choose which layer comp to use from the Photoshop fi le within the InDesign 
document.
When you use layered Photoshop fi les in your InDesign layouts, you can change the 
visibility of the layers directly within InDesign. You do not need to go back to Photoshop 
to create or save diff erent versions of an image. In this exercise, you will display diff erent 
versions of an image by changing the visibility of the Photoshop layers and layer comps.

Lesson 6, Creating and Using Tables
Lesson 6
Tables are an eff ective way to convey large amounts of data in an 
organized manner. Whether you import a table from Microsoft Word 
or Excel, or build a new one using InDesign, you can use many 
powerful methods for designing impressive, professional-looking 
tables. After designing a table, you can save all the attributes as a 
style and quickly apply those attributes to another table with just 
one click using table styles. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in the Starting up 
section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the id06lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have copied the id06lessons folder onto your hard drive from the Digital Classroom 
DVD. See “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. This lesson may 
be easier to follow if the id06lessons folder is on your desktop.
Creating and Using Tables
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Creating and importing 
tables
• Pasting text into a table
• Editing tables and table 
options
• Formatting cells, rows and 
text
• Defi ning a header cell
• Using graphics in tables
• Creating cell and table 
styles to format tables

See Lesson 6 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
The project
In this lesson, you will add tables to a brochure for Bella’s Bakery. The fi rst page of the 
brochure is complete, but the second page needs tables to list the products for sale. To 
preview the results you’ll be working toward, navigate to the id06lessons folder and open 
id0601_done.indd. Once you’ve looked over the layout, you can close the fi le by choosing 
File > Close, or keep it open for reference as you work.
This is what the fi nal layout should look like.
Creating a table
You can create a table using one of three methods: from scratch by typing in your data, by 
copying and pasting information from another table, or by converting tabbed text into a 
table. In this section, you’ll start with creating a table from scratch, and then explore the 
other two options as well. Tables exist inside text frames, so to create a table you must fi rst 
make a text frame. To select or modify a table, you must use the Type tool.

Lesson 6, Creating and Using Tables
Creating a table
Creating new tables
The Bella’s Bakery brochure needs multiple tables. For this fi rst one, you’ll use the Insert 
Table control to design your own tables.
1 
Within InDesign, choose Window > Mini Bridge to display the Mini Bridge panel. 
Click the Launch Bridge button, navigate to the id06lessons folder, and open the fi le 
id0601.indd. The fi le opens in InDesign.
2 
Click the Pages button (
) in the dock on the right side of the workspace to open the 
Pages panel. Page 2 should be highlighted in blue to indicate that it’s the active page. If 
it’s not highlighted, double-click page 2 in the Pages panel to make it the active page. 
3 
Choose View > Fit Page in Window or press Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 
(Mac OS) to that you can see all of page 2 of your document.
4 
Activate the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel, then click and drag to create a new 
text frame starting in the upper-left corner of the layout’s middle column to the 
lower-right corner of the same column.
5 
Choose Table > Insert Table.
Choose Insert Table from the Table menu.

In the Insert Table dialog box that appears, type 7 for the Body Rows, and 4 for the 
Columns.
The Insert Table dialog box with the correct settings.
7 
Click OK to close the dialog box and insert the table. A table with four columns and 
seven rows appears in the second column’s text frame.
The resulting table has four columns and seven rows.
Copying and pasting table information
You now have a table with no data. You could type the information into the table, but 
InDesign off ers an easier way: cutting and pasting data from another table. InDesign CS6 
provides great fl exibility when copying information by allowing you to copy data from 
a Microsoft Excel or Word table and paste those entries into a selected table in InDesign. 
Using the Clipboard Handling section of the InDesign Preferences, you can specify 
whether the text pasted from another application retains its original formatting or not. If 
you check Text Only, the information appears as unformatted text, which you can then 
fl ow into a selected table. If All Information is selected, the pasted text appears as the table 
looked in Word or Excel, and InDesign imports the styles from those programs. You must 
select the destination table’s cells prior to pasting. 
Because you may or may not have Word or Excel, for this exercise you will practice 
copying and pasting just between InDesign tables.

diagonally toward the lower-right corner. Click to select the entire table.
Click when the arrow in the upper-left corner 
is displayed to select the entire table.
When hovering over a table, the cursor image indicates which parts of the table you can select. 
The diagonal arrow means you can select the whole table. An arrow pointing to the right 
indicates that clicking selects a row. Click when the arrow points straight down, and you select a 
single column. You can also click and drag across the top or left side of the table to select a range 
of columns or rows, respectively.
6 
Choose Edit > Copy to copy the selected table to the clipboard.
7 
On page 2, you need to select the table you created in the previous exercise, which is 
the destination table. Double-click the Hand tool to fi t the page to the window. Select 
the whole table by moving the Type tool over the top-left corner of the table, and 
clicking when you see the diagonal arrow.

Converting text to a table and a table to text 
If you prefer, you can bypass the step of creating a table grid, and simply paste data from 
an existing table into a text frame in your document. The information appears as tab-
delimited text, which you can then convert into a table using the Table menu’s Convert 
Text to Table command. You can also perform this process in the opposite direction using 
Convert Table to Text. When you choose this command, InDesign removes the table lines 
and inserts the separators you specify at the end of each row and column. 
To demonstrate both commands, you will convert the table you just created to text and 
then convert the text back to a table.
1 
With the table on page 2 still selected, choose Table > Convert Table to Text.
2 
In the Convert Table to Text dialog box, Tab should be set as the Column Separator 
and Paragraph should be set as the Row Separator.
Specify your item separators in the Convert Table to Text dialog box.
3 
Click OK. InDesign inserts tabs between each column entry, and paragraph returns 
after each row, removing all table lines. 
The table is now tab-delimited text.
You will now take this mess of text and turn it back into a table.
4 
With the Type tool ( ), click inside the text frame, and then choose Edit > Select All, 
or press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac OS), to highlight all the text.

Importing a table
For some projects, you may need to incorporate an existing table created in Microsoft 
Word or Excel into your layout. Instead of simply pasting a table into the document, 
the better approach is to use the Place command, which gives you more control over 
formatting. When you place a Word or Excel document, you can edit the resulting table in 
InDesign using its Microsoft Word Import options to control the formatting. 
1 
With id0601_work.indd still open, activate the Type tool ( ) and choose File > Place 
to insert the Microsoft Word document with a table into page 2 of your InDesign fi le.
2 
Click to turn on the Show Import Options checkbox at the bottom-left of the Place 
dialog box. Navigate to the id06lessons folder, select id0601.docx, and click Open. 
InDesign supports the latest XML-based open format from Word and Excel.

The Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box appears. Click the Remove Styles and 
Formatting from Text and Tables radio button, located in the Formatting section of the 
dialog box, to strip the incoming document of all Word formatting and replace it with 
the InDesign Basic Paragraph style. This is a good idea if you don’t want any of the 
styles, colors, or other formatting from Word in your InDesign document. Later in 
this lesson, you will format the text and save the results as your own styles.
For more on importing text, see Lesson 3, “Working with Text and Type.”
Strip the Word document of its formatting to avoid any inconsistencies once it’s in InDesign.

Editing tables and table options
InDesign CS6 has all the same table tools you’ve come to rely on to make your table 
presentations visually pleasing. In this series of exercises, you will concentrate on ways 
to adjust the entire Word table you imported. First you’ll change the height of the top 
row, and then you will explore Table Options to change the border row strokes, column 
strokes, and fi ll of the table.
Changing row height 
If your rows are too short to hold your entries, you can easily expand them.

Formatting cells and text
Unlike the Table Options settings that apply to the whole table, your cell styles and Cell 
Options settings can be diff erent for each cell in the table. You can select and format 
one cell at a time, an entire row, an entire column, or any other group of cells. You will 
now format the table on a cell-by-cell basis. You will start by resetting the cell style of 
all the cells in the table, and then you’ll change the vertical alignment of type within all 
cells. Finally, you will make four paragraph styles, one each for the table’s header, name, 
description, and price sections. In later exercises, you’ll use these paragraph styles to create 
cell styles that will speed the rest of the table’s formatting, and ultimately you’ll use the cell 
styles to create a table style with which you’ll format the entire Pies table. 
Resetting the cell styles within a table
Soon you will make both cell and table styles so that you can quickly apply all the 
attributes of a table and also the cells within a table using a single click of the mouse. 
But as we start this lesson, this table has mixed cell styles, which means that some of the 
settings from Microsoft Word have remained with the table. You’ll start by clearing the 
additional formatting.

Lesson 6, Creating and Using Tables
Formatting cells and text
Text alignment and inset within a cell
Some cell formatting options are similar to the Text frame options you worked with in 
previous lessons. For example, you can use the same alignment options within a cell—top, 
center, bottom, and justifi ed—as you can in a text box. You also have the same text inset 
settings that control how far from the edge of a cell text is inset. You will now change 
these settings for the whole table. You can also change these options one cell at a time, for 
a range of cells, or for all the cells at once. For the Bella’s Bakery table, you will change 
the alignment and inset settings for all the cells at once.
1 
Make sure the whole table is selected, and then choose Table > Cell Options > Text 
to open the Cell Options dialog box.
After you select the table, choose Cell Options > Text from the Table menu.

Formatting text within a cell and saving paragraph styles
You can also format the text color and font size in your cells. You can then save these 
settings as a paragraph style for reuse later; applying styles to cells is as easy as applying 
them to text frames. In this exercise, you’ll create several paragraph styles from your cell 
formatting. In the next section, you’ll apply these styles to other cells and see how much 
time you can save by using styles.

InDesign CS6 lets you view tables in the Story Editor. You can use the Story Editor to 
make sure you have applied the correct paragraph styles to the selected columns.
1 
Click anywhere inside the table with the Type tool ( ).
2 
Choose Edit > Edit in Story Editor. The Story Editor opens up and allows you to 
view the table away from the page, while you can still see which styles are applied to 
each row and column. Each row is displayed in blue text in the Story Editor and each 
entry within each row represents a column or cell within that row.
The Story Editor in InDesign CS6 displays tables and identifi es styles applied to them.
Make sure that the correct styles are applied. You can make edits directly in the Story 
Editor and the changes are immediately applied to the layout. Close the Story Editor 
by clicking the “X” in the top-right corner (Windows), or the red circle in the top-
left corner (Mac OS).

Merging cells
You can merge multiple cells in the same row or column into a single cell. To 
demonstrate, you will merge the top four cells (the fi rst row) of the example table so that 
the top row (with the word Cakes in it) looks more like a title. In the next section, you’ll 
format it to stand out even more.
1 
Select the cells in the fi rst row by hovering your cursor over the left edge of the box 
until you see an arrow pointing to the right. Click to select the entire row.
2 
Choose Table > Merge Cells or click the Merge Cells button ( ) in the Control panel 
to make the top four cells into a single cell.
Merge the top four cells into one cell for the Cakes header.
Defining a header cell
For a large table that spans multiple columns, frames, or pages, you can designate header or 
footer rows in order to repeat identifying information at the top or bottom of each portion 
of the divided table. If your table spans over several pages, headers are vital to orienting 
readers with the table’s data. For instance, if the number of cakes sold by Bella’s Bakery 
increased enough to require two columns in its brochure, the next linked frame would 
automatically contain a header row. This saves you the time of inserting the header on 
each subsequent page.
Because it treats header cells as special cases, InDesign enables you to color and format 
them independently, without changing the features of the rest of the table. You can take 
advantage of this to help the headers stand out from the body of your table. Your header

will be instantly identifi able when repeated in a multi-page, -column, or –frame layout, 
and your readers will be able to more easily decipher the information in the table. In this 
exercise, you will convert the Cakes cell into a header cell, apply unique formatting, and 
create a new paragraph style from it. Then you’ll create a header for the Pies table.
If you just click in a cell or even highlight its contents, InDesign thinks you want to color the 
text. Either click with the right-pointing arrow or press the Esc key to select an entire cell.
1 
Making sure the top row is still selected, choose Table > Convert Rows > To Header 
to make the top cell a header cell. Click once inside the cell with the Type tool ( ), 
and notice how the color drops out of the cell. It’s a header cell now, so InDesign 
strips the normal cell formatting. You’ll now add some header-specifi c formatting.
2 
The cell’s fi ll should automatically change to None because it is now separate from the 
rest of the table. Select the cell in the fi rst row by hovering your cursor over the left 
edge of the box until you see an arrow pointing to the right. Click to select the entire 
row. In the Swatches panel, make sure the Fill icon (
) is in the foreground and click 
the Paper swatch to color the topmost cell.
Paper is opaque and represents the background on which the document will print. By 
contrast, the None option is transparent and displays any objects beneath it.
Choose Paper for the fi ll in the Swatches panel.
3 
With the Type tool ( ), click anywhere in the header cell to activate the cell, and then 
double-click on the word Cakes to select only the text. 
Now you will stylize the type and make a paragraph style.

Center the type in the cell by pressing Shift+Ctrl+C (Windows) or 
Shift+Command+C (Mac OS). In the Control panel, click on the Small Caps button 
( ) to convert the title to a mix of large and small caps, and type 24 in the Font Size 
text fi eld. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to increase the size of the text. 
If the type disappears from the cell, the type is too large for the cell to contain it. Hover over the 
bottom of the header cell until you see the double-arrow cursor, and then click and drag down. 
Make sure you don’t lose any of the table at the bottom because of overfl ow.

Choose Type > Character to reveal the Character panel. Type 100 in the Tracking 
text fi eld and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). You can use either the 
Character panel or the Control panel to control character formatting.
Change the tracking in the Character panel.

236
Setting column and row dimensions
At this point, you’ve adjusted the contents of rows and columns, but you haven’t modifi ed 
the row height or column width directly. By default, row height is determined by the 
height of the current font. Tables imported from Microsoft Word or Excel, however, 
can retain their original, exact row heights. If neither of these options fi ts your layout, 
InDesign enables you to change row height and column width in the Cell Options dialog 
box. Here you can specify whether you want a fi xed row height that does not change 
when you add to or delete from the row, or, if you prefer, a variable height. For a fi xed 
height, choose Exactly from the Row Height drop-down menu, and then specify the 
height you need. Choose At Least to specify a minimum row height; with this setting, 
rows increase in height as you add text or increase the font size, but will not be smaller 
than the minimum you set. Try out these cell options on the Cakes and Pies tables. 
Setting a fixed row height
For the Cakes and Pies tables, a fi xed row height works best. In the steps that follow, you’ll 
adjust the size of the cells and also change their Row height to be an exact value. Then 
you will do the same for the Pies table.
1 
Using the Type tool ( ), click in the Cakes header cell, and then press the Esc key to 
select the cell.
2 
Choose Table > Cell Options > Rows and Columns to open the Cell Options dialog 
box. In the Row Height section, choose Exactly from the drop-down menu. Type 0.5 
in the Row Height text fi eld, and then click OK. The height of the header row changes.
Set the row height to exactly 0.5 in the Cell Options dialog box.

Using graphics in tables
Images can spice up any table and, perhaps, help sell a few more of Bella’s pies and cakes. 
InDesign off ers three ways to insert graphics into tables: select a cell with the Type tool 
and choose File > Place, or select the graphic with the Selection tool, cut or copy it, and 
then paste it into the table with the Type tool, or use the blue anchored object indicator 
located in the upper-right of a frame to drag and drop into position. When you add a 
graphic that is larger than the cell, the cell height increases to contain the graphic; the 
width of the cell doesn’t change, but the image may extend beyond the right side of the 
cell. If you place a graphic in a cell of a row set to a fi xed height and that image is taller 
than the row height, InDesign marks the cell as overset and adds a red circle, instead of the 
image, to the cell. You then need to correct either the height of the table row or the size of 
the image so the image appears in the cell.
Placing graphics in cells
In this exercise, you’ll add images to the Bella’s Bakery tables. To expedite the process, the 
document’s pasteboard contains appropriately sized graphics that are ready to place. Instead 
of using the Selection tool to select them, changing to the Type tool, and then back to the 
Selection tool, you’ll use a much more effi  cient shortcut to manage this task.

With the Selection tool ( ), click the cherry cheesecake picture in the top-left area 
of the pasteboard to select it. If you are still in Preview mode, you can’t see your 
pasteboard. Press W on the keyboard to exit or enter Preview mode.
Choose the cherry cheesecake image on the pasteboard to the left of the document.
2 
Choose Edit > Cut, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+X (Windows) or Command+X 
(Mac OS) to cut the image to the clipboard. You will put all the graphics into the 
empty table cells in exactly the order they already appear on the pasteboard.
3 
In the Cakes table, double-click the second-from-left cell in the second row. Double-
clicking any cell that can contain text automatically turns the Selection tool into the 
Type tool ( ).
4 
Press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste the picture into the 
selected cell.
5 
Move back over the pasteboard, and then press and hold Ctrl (Windows) or Command

When you paste a figure into a table cell, you’re creating an inline graphic or graphic 
that behaves as a piece of text. InDesign CS6 offers an efficient way to create inline 
graphics with drag and drop ease.
8 
With the Selection tool, click the third graphic on the pasteboard and hover your 
cursor over the blue box located in the upper-right corner of the frame. Press and hold 
the Shift key on your keyboard, click the blue box, and drag it to the second cell in 
the Bundt Cake row. The graphic is immediately added to that location.
Shift+drag the blue box in the upper-right corner of the 
graphics frame to the empty cell in the table.

Repeat step 8 for the remaining cake pictures, and then repeat them again to paste 
the pie graphics from the right side of the pasteboard into the Pies table to fi t in their 
respective rows, or use the copy/paste method.
Using the drag-and-drop method to place 
graphics in table cells lets you format the 
tables quickly.
It is possible to make a photo fi t entirely within a table cell; however, there are a few things to 
account for. Every cell has a text inset applied by default. To ensure that a photo fi ts within the 
cell, remove the cell inset so the photo can extend to the cell border. In addition, if you have any 
strokes applied to a cell, you need to reduce the size of the graphics frame by the value of those 
stroke values.

Lesson 6, Creating and Using Tables
Cell styles and table styles
Cell styles and table styles
With InDesign CS6, you can use cell styles to format cells, and table styles to format 
tables, in the same way you use paragraph and character styles to format text. Beyond that, 
you can nest cell styles into a table style in the same way that you can nest character styles 
into paragraph styles. Cell styles contain such information as paragraph styles, cell insets, 
strokes, and fi lls, which means that you can apply all these attributes to a cell or range 
of cells with one click. When you make a cell style, however, it does not automatically 
include all the selected cell’s formatting. From a collection of cell styles, you can build 
table styles. Table styles contain cell styles as well as Table Options settings, including table 
borders and row and column strokes. As with all InDesign styles, when you update a table 
or cell style, all elements to which the style is applied update automatically. These Table 
styles give you the ability to format an entire table with one click and implement changes 
throughout a document’s tables.
By default, each new document contains a Basic Table style with basic table formatting. 
However, you can customize Table styles to apply to the tables you create. In addition, 
each document contains a default cell style called None, which is a quick way to remove 
all cell attributes, as you discovered in the “Resetting the cell styles within a table” section. 
You cannot modify the None style.
When you use cell styles in a table style, you can specify which cell styles are applied to 
diff erent sections of the table: header and footer rows, left and right columns, and body rows. 
Cell styles
Because you have already formatted the table and cells and also created paragraph styles, 
you can now reap the rewards of setting up a table using the correct process. With all these 
elements in place, you can now easily create cell styles. In this exercise, you’ll create four 
cell styles—Header, Name, Description, and Price—that contain the paragraph styles you 
made earlier.

Using the Type tool ( ), click inside the Cherry Cheesecake cell, and then press Ctrl+/ 
(Windows) or Command+/ (Mac OS) to select it.

Creating table styles
Compared to setting up the initial attributes, making a table style from a group of cell 
styles is fast and easy. All you have to do is choose which cell styles you want to use and 
tell InDesign which style to use where. The action takes place in the New Table Style 
dialog box. Here you can specify which cell styles are applied to diff erent sections of the 
table: header and footer rows, left and right columns, and body rows. 
In this exercise, you’ll compile the cell styles from your Cakes table into a table style for 
use on the Pies table.

Lesson 7, Using Color in Your Documents 
Lesson 7
Using color for text, frames, and paths is a basic task in InDesign. 
The more ways you know how to apply, change, and control color, 
the faster you can work. Color choices are not limited to picking from 
the small selection that appears in the Swatches panel. You can create 
your own colors, gradients, and tints, as well as choose from a number 
of swatch libraries, such as Pantone colors, that are supplied for you 
within InDesign.
Starting up

through the Tools panel, the Swatches panel, the Color panel, and the Color Picker. You 
can also assign color using the Eyedropper tool. No matter which method you choose, you 
must perform the same three steps: select the text or object that you want to color, specify 
which part of the object you want to color, and then choose the color to apply.

Lesson 7, Using Color in Your Documents 
Applying colors to frames and text 
Applying color to text
Applying color is a quick, straightforward process. To practice, you will color the text in 
the FiFi’s Face Cream ad.
1 
Choose File > Open. Navigate to the id07lessons folder, select the fi le id0701.indd, 
and then click Open.
2 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the id07lessons folder 
and type id0701_work.indd in the Name text fi eld. Click Save. 
3 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel and click inside the frame containing the 
text, It leaves your skin feeling noticeably clean and absolutely radiant.
4 
Choose Edit > Select All to select all the text inside the frame.
5 
Select Window > Swatches or click the Swatches button ( ) in the dock on the right 
side of the workspace to open the Swatches panel. 
Color the object from the Swatches panel.
The fi rst thing to consider is whether you want to color the border (stroke) or the 
inside (fi ll) of the selected text. In the upper-left corner of the Swatches panel are two 
icons overlapping one another. The icon with the outlined T and the red diagonal line 
running through it is the Stroke icon (
). The icon with the solid black T inside it is 
the Fill icon (
). In order to apply color, you must click the appropriate icon to bring 
it forward and make it active. In this case, you want to fi ll the text with the color Dark 
Blue. If necessary, bring the Fill icon forward. 
You can also press the X key on your keyboard to toggle between Fill and Stroke in the Swatches 
panel, as long as you don’t have the Type tool activated.

To quickly reset the default colors, click the icon in the lower-left area (
) near the Fill/Stroke 
box in the Tools panel. The default color for objects is no fi ll (None) with a black stroke; a black 
fi ll with no stroke (None) is the default color for text.
Choose the fi ll and stroke colors in the 
Swatches panel by bringing their respective 
icons forward.
6 
In the Swatches panel make sure the Fill icon is forward, then click on the Dark Blue 
option. The text turns blue. Choose Edit > Deselect All to view the change.
Applying color to frames
Next you will color the border, or stroke, of the frame around the text. Follow the same 
three basic steps that you went through to apply color to the text: Select the frame, specify 
fi ll or stroke, and choose the color. 
1 
Activate the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and click on the frame that begins 
It leaves your skin…. Notice that the Stroke and Fill icons no longer have a T (for 
Type), but now appear as a solid square for the Fill, and an outlined square for the 
Stroke. Make sure the text frame is selected.

Select Dark Blue in the Swatches panel to apply the color to the frame. Note that 
depending on your current zoom level, it may not look like the color of the stroke is 
changing. For a more accurate view, zoom in on the frame prior applying the new color.
Choose Dark Blue in the Swatches panel to color the text frame’s stroke.
Applying Live Corner Effects
InDesign provides a new feature called Live Corner Eff ects that enables you to adjust the 
radius and style of the corners of a frame visually without the need to open a separate 
dialog box. To give the frame a little more style, you will round its edges.
1 
With the Selection tool ( ) active, click on the text frame on the right side of the ad to 
select the frame.

Corner shape options
Although the rounded corner effect is the default when using the Live Corner Effects feature, it’s 
not the only choice available. With a frame selected, you can quickly choose a different corner 
effect by clicking on the corner shape drop-down menu in the Control panel and choosing from 
a variety of shapes, including Fancy, Bevel, Inset, Inverse Rounded, and Rounded.

Creating and saving a new swatch
You can create your own custom color swatches, or use those supplied by InDesign. When 
you create a color or gradient, InDesign automatically shows it in the Fill/Stroke box 
in the Tools panel, and also displays it in the Swatches panel and Color panel. Because 
InDesign also automatically applies the new color to whatever you have selected, you need 
to be very careful to select only the items you want colored before you begin. In the next 
exercises, you will create, name, and apply two new colors. 
The Swatches panel can contain spot colors, process colors, mixed inks (combinations of multiple 
spot and process colors), RGB or Lab colors, gradients, or tints. This exercise concentrates on 
CMYK colors, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black, but you’ll learn more about the specialized 
color options in later sections. 
1 
To make sure nothing on the pasteboard is selected, press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or 
Shift+Command+A (Mac OS).
If you activate any of the InDesign drawing tools, such as the Rectangle tool, or any of the tools 
hidden beneath it—Line tool, Pen tool, Pencil tool, or the Type tool—and choose a color swatch, 
the default color is set for these tools, and every time the tool is used, it will be preset to this color. 
If you choose a color with one of these tools active and no objects selected, you will establish the 
new default color for this group of tools.
2 
If necessary, click the Swatches button (
) in the dock to open the Swatches panel. 
From the Swatches panel menu (
), choose New Color Swatch.
3 
In the resulting New Color Swatch dialog box, uncheck the Name with Color Value 
checkbox so you can name this color swatch as you create it. Type Green in the 
Swatch Name text fi eld.

4 
Increase the Cyan percentage to 80 percent by moving the slider bar to the right of 
Cyan or typing 80 into the % text fi eld. Using the sliders or typing the percentages, 
set Magenta to 10 percent, Yellow to 100 percent, and Black to 0 percent. These 
percentage tints of the process inks combine to create the new color.
To create a new color, adjust the percentages in the New Color Swatch dialog box, 
and then click OK.
5 
Click OK to create the new color. Green now appears at the very bottom of the 
Swatches panel. When you make a new color swatch, it always appears at the bottom 
of the list of swatches. You can change the order of the swatches by simply clicking 
and dragging them within the Swatches panel. 
6 
In the Swatches panel, click and drag the Green swatch upward so it is positioned just 
below Dark Blue, and then release it. You should see a black line indicating where 
the swatch will appear before you drop it. You may want to expand the size of the 
Swatches panel to minimize scrolling within the panel.
Click and drag to rearrange swatches in the Swatches panel.

Applying strokes to text
In the next exercise, you will fi ll text with the new color, as well as create a contrasting 
color for the text’s stroke. You’ll also get your fi rst look at the Stroke panel, which gives 
you control over the weight and appearance of an element’s stroke or border. 
1 
With the Selection tool ( ) active, double-click the frame containing the words Face 
Cream in the lower-left corner of the document. This automatically converts the 
Selection tool to the Type tool ( ). Alternately, you can also choose the Type tool and 
click inside the frame. Press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac OS) to select 
all the text in the frame.
2 
In the Swatches panel, click the Fill icon (
) to bring it forward, and click the Green 
swatch you made in the previous exercise. Face Cream is now green.
Turn the Face Cream text green.
You will now make a new color for the stroke.

Change the Cyan to 32 percent by moving its slider bar or typing 32 in the % text 
fi eld. Using the sliders or typing in the percentages, set Magenta to 6 percent, Yellow 
to 3 percent, and Black to 0 percent.
Create a light-blue color by adjusting the CMYK percentages.
6 
Click OK. InDesign automatically applies Light Blue to the stroke of the text. The 
stroke doesn’t quite stand out enough, however. In the next steps, you’ll use the Stroke 
panel to increase the stroke’s width.
Don’t forget to reorganize the swatches for the best workfl ow. For example, because Green and 
Light Blue will be used in combination for text in the ad, click and drag the Light Blue swatch just 
below Green in the Swatches panel. A black line indicates where the swatch will appear before you 
drop it. Rearranging swatches into logical groups for your project is a good practice to follow.

Creating a tint reduction 
A tint, sometimes called a screen, is a lighter shade of a color. Tinting is a great way to 
use colors at diff erent intensities. Just as you can with regular colors, you can (and should) 
save tints in the Swatches panel to make editing tints fast and easy. Because colors and 
their tints maintain their relationship in the Swatches panel, a change to the original color 
swatch also updates any tints of that swatch that have been made. In this exercise, you will 
create a tint to use in the ad.
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click the frame that contains the word FiFi’s. Use the 
Selection tool to select the frame as an object because it is no longer type. It was 
converted to outlines and is now a path, and is therefore no longer editable as text.
2 
Click the Swatches button (
) in the dock to open the Swatches panel, and make sure 
the Fill icon is in the foreground. Select the Light Blue swatch to apply the color to 
the fi ll.

Making a dashed stroke
Making a dashed stroke
You’ve practiced applying, coloring, and widening a basic stroke, but InDesign off ers many 
more ways to customize strokes. To demonstrate, you will make a custom dash around the 
border of the FiFi’s ad.
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), select the black frame running around the edge of the ad.
2 
In the Swatches panel, click the Stroke indicator icon ( ) to bring it forward.
3 
Open the Stroke panel by clicking the Stroke button (
) in the panel dock. Use the 
up-arrow to the left of the Weight text fi eld to increase the stroke thickness to 4 
points. Notice that the frame, which was aligned to the size of the page, is now bigger 
than the page. This is because the default alignment of a stroke is centered on the 
frame. In this case, half the width of the stroke (two points) is now inside the frame 
and half the width of the stroke (two points) is outside the frame. You will change this 
stroke alignment next.
If every time you make a frame, you notice yourself changing the alignment to the inside so that 
the frame doesn’t extend beyond the path, you can make an Object Style with the stroke aligned 
to the inside. Or, better yet, change the settings right in the Object Styles panel by adjusting the 
Basic Text Frame and the Basic Graphics Frame options.
4 
In the Stroke panel, click the Align Stroke to Inside button ( ). The border appears to 
jump inside the frame, because all stroke edges are now aligned to the inside of the frame.

Still in the Stroke panel, click the Type drop-down menu to reveal all the various 
styles of strokes you can make. Choose Dashed. Dash and Gap options appear at the 
bottom of the Stroke panel. The dash is the stroke segments, and the gap is the space 
between the dashes.
Choose Dashed for the ad’s border.
6 
Make sure the fi rst dash text fi eld shows 12 pt. This sets the length of the dash. In the 
fi rst gap text fi eld, type 3, which sets the length of the gap between dashes. Type 11 
in the third text fi eld to set a second dash length. In the remaining gap and dash text 
fi elds, type 2 and 10, respectively, leaving the fi nal gap fi eld empty. This sequence of 
dashes and gaps will repeat where this stroke is applied.
Set the dash and gap options in the 
Stroke panel.

Creating and saving gradients 
A gradient is a smooth and gradual transition between two or more colors. When you 
fi rst apply a gradient, the default is set to two color stops. A color stop is one of at least two 
colors used to create a gradient. You can add as many stops as you want to a gradient, and 
also control how quickly or slowly the colors fade into each other. You can also change 
the direction of a gradient, and even choose whether it is a linear gradient, appearing as a 
straight-line transition, or a radial gradient, which appears in a circular form. In this series 
of exercises, you will make and save linear and radial gradients, as well as use the Gradient 
tool to change the direction of the gradient.

Linear gradients
You create gradients in the Gradient panel, and then add colors to the transition by 
dragging and dropping them as color stops on the gradient bar in the panel. You’ll build a 
gradient next.
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click the frame containing the words, It leaves your skin 
feeling noticeably clean and absolutely radiant.
Always select an object before starting the gradient. It’s easier to build a gradient when you have 
something selected because you can preview exactly how the color transitions will look.

Toward the bottom of the Tools panel are overlapping Fill and Stroke icons, just as in 
the Swatches panel. Select the Fill icon to bring it forward. 
3 
Choose Window > Color > Gradient to display it. From the Type drop-down menu 
in this panel, choose Linear. The frame now has a white-to-black linear gradient 
applied by default.
Use the Gradient panel to apply a white-to-black gradient to the frame.

Lesson 7, Using Color in Your Documents 
Creating and saving gradients 
You will now add colors to the gradient. Make sure you can see both the Gradient 
and Swatches panels, as you will be dragging colors from the Swatches panel into the 
Gradient panel. Because you can’t have two docked panels displayed at the same time, 
it will be necessary to have one of the panels undocked for this exercise.
4 
Click and hold the Light Blue swatch in the Swatches panel. Don’t just click or you 
will simply apply the color to the selected frame. Drag the swatch to the right side of 
the gradient color bar until the cursor becomes a hand with a plus sign (
). The line 
cursor on the gradient bar disappears, indicating that it will replace the black color 
stop with the light blue one. Be careful to replace the original color rather than add 
another color stop next to it. Whether replacing or adding a color stop, the cursor 
displays a plus sign when you add a color stop to the gradient.
This cursor indicates that you are dragging a color 
from the Swatches panel to the Gradient panel. 
Drop the color over a color stop to apply it.
5 
Release the mouse to drop the color. The gradient bar now has a White color stop on 
the left and a Light Blue color stop on the right. The frame in the ad should look the 
same way, with the color fading from white on the left to light blue on the right.

Radial gradient
The last gradient you made was a linear gradient, which means it fades from one color to 
another along straight lines. This is the default in InDesign. You will now explore radial 
gradients, which are gradients that don’t fade color in the form of lines, but as circles. 
If you wanted to make a sphere that looked like light was hitting the top of it, with the 
shadow at the bottom, you could use the radial gradient to accomplish this. You will use 
the radial gradient to make bubbles in this next exercise.
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click the far-left circle in the ad.
2 
In the Swatches panel, click the Stroke icon ( ) to bring it forward. Select None for 
the stroke.

InDesign makes it easy to share attributes among document elements, so that you can 
make global changes with minimal eff ort. 
Using the Eyedropper tool to copy frame attributes
When you need to copy attributes from one element to another in a document, choose 
the Eyedropper tool. It can pick up both type and frame attributes, such as fi ll and stroke 
settings, and apply those characteristics to other text or frames. By default, the Eyedropper 
tool picks up all attributes, but you can choose to transfer only specifi c settings using the 
Eyedropper Options dialog box. You will use the Eyedropper tool to quickly copy the 
attributes from one frame to another.

Applying colors to multiple objects
Although the Eyedropper tool is quite handy for copying multiple attributes to single 
objects, sometimes you want to apply changes to multiple objects at once. InDesign makes 
this simple. When you select a group of objects, you can apply a fi ll or stroke to all of them 
with one click. Practice this by adding gradients to the ad’s remaining circles.
1 
Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel, and then click a circle that still has 
a black stroke and no fi ll. 
2 
Shift+click every circle that does not have the gradient fi ll.
Shift+click to select all the unfi lled circles.

Updating and editing colors
When you apply a swatch to multiple objects in InDesign, each of those objects is 
related to that color in the Swatches panel. If you then change the color of the swatch, 
all instances of the color throughout the document change. This makes it quick and easy 
to make global color changes. In this exercise, you will change the Light Blue swatch to 
experiment with a new look for the ad.

Using and saving spot colors

Using and saving spot colors
Spot colors are premixed ink colors that provide very accurate and vibrant color when 
printed. They are often used to maintain brand identity when printing corporate logos 
or simply to add visual appeal to a job. Spot colors can produce colors that simply are not 
possible using process (CMYK) colors. Spot colors require their own printing plates on a 
printing press, which may increase the cost of a commercial printing job; however, when 
critical color matching is required, spot colors are second to none. 
For the most accurate representation of a spot color, certain things must be considered. 
First, you should pick the spot color from a color-matching system supported by your 
commercial printer. Several color-matching libraries ship with InDesign. You must also 
remember that a color’s appearance depends on many variables such as the limits of your 
printer, and the paper stock it’s printed on.
Fortunately, you can manipulate spot colors in InDesign just as you can ordinary CMYK 
colors. You can create your own spot colors in the Swatches panel, or place an image that 
contains a spot color to add that color automatically to the panel. You can adjust and apply 
spot colors in the Swatches panel, using them for fi lls, strokes, or gradients. In this exercise, 
you will create a spot color to apply to the ad.
1 
Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Command+A (Mac OS) to make sure 
nothing is selected.
2 
In the Swatches panel, click the panel menu button (
) and choose New Color Swatch.
3 
In the resulting New Color Swatch dialog box, choose Spot from the Color Type 
drop-down menu.
Choose Spot from the Color Type drop-down menu to designate a swatch as a spot color.

4 
Choose PANTONE+ Solid Coated from the Color Mode drop-down menu to 
change it from CMYK. PANTONE+ solid coated and PANTONE+ solid uncoated 
are the two most common ink color libraries; coated is for a coated or glossy paper, 
while uncoated is for uncoated paper stock. Now you need to specify which spot color 
you want to work with.
5 
In the Pantone text fi eld, type 662. This automatically brings you to that Pantone 
color, a dark blue.
Choose PANTONE+ Solid Coated from the Color Mode drop-down menu, and then enter color 662.
6 
Click OK to close the dialog box and add the swatch named Pantone 662 C to the 
Swatches panel. The swatch is automatically named. 
7 
Drag the Pantone 662 C swatch up in the Swatches panel and drop it directly beneath 
the Light Blue Radial gradient swatch. You will apply the new spot color in the next 
exercise.
Colorizing a grayscale image
InDesign can colorize any grayscale image you import as long as it does not contain any spot 
colors or alpha channels. The two raindrops in the ad are grayscale images that had clipping 
paths applied. This format enables you to change the colors of black and gray into whatever 
color you would like. You will use the Pantone 662 C color created in the last exercise.
1 
To color only the pixels of the image, choose the Direct Selection tool ( ) from the 
Tools panel. If you try to colorize the image when it is selected with the Selection tool 
instead, the fi ll of the whole box will be colored.
2 
Select one of the raindrops. A path appears around the edge of the raindrop.
3 
In the Swatches panel, make sure the Fill icon is forward. Select the Pantone 662 C 
swatch to apply the color to the raindrop.
4 
Select the other raindrop with the Direct Selection tool ( ).

Open the id0702_work.indd fi le you saved earlier in the id07lessons folder to practice 
some additional color variations:
• Try adjusting more colors in the Swatches panel to make universal changes across the ad.
• Create another spot color and recolor the grayscale raindrops again.
• Select the text frame with the linear gradient. Experiment by dragging more colors into 
the gradient, and use the Gradient Swatch tool to change the gradient’s direction.
• Make a new color and put a stroke on the text, It leaves your skin feeling noticeably clean and 
absolutely radiant.
• Design a new radial gradient for the bubbles, and practice coloring some of them 
individually with the Eyedropper tool.
• Experiment with the Adobe Kuler panel to try diff erent swatch groups and create new 
color combinations. Access the Kuler panel by choosing Window > Extensions > Kuler, 
and then create new color themes and add them to the Swatches panel or upload and 
share them.

The project
In this lesson, you will jazz-up a two-page spread using the Eff ects panel in InDesign CS6. 
You can experiment with blending modes, opacity, and other eff ects without permanently 
changing the objects, and then you can save eff ects as an object style so that you can easily 
apply the eff ects to other objects. If you want to take a peek at what the fi nished project 
should look like, open the id0801_done.indd fi le located in the id08lessons folder.

Creative effects 
InDesign’s Eff ects panel off ers a way to use Photoshop-like eff ects in InDesign documents. 
You can apply feathering and drop shadows, as well as control the opacity and blending 
modes of objects, text, and photos. Not only can you apply eff ects, but you can also apply 
them to either the whole object, or to just the fi ll, stroke, or text in a frame. Better yet, you 
can turn those eff ects on or off  nondestructively, without permanently changing the objects.

Lesson 8, Using Eff ects
Creative eff ects 
Applying opacity to objects
Opacity settings make an object or text appear transparent; to varying degrees, you 
can see through the object to the objects that appear behind it. If the opacity is set to 0 
percent, the object is completely invisible. By default, all objects are set to 100 percent, 
or completely opaque. Some people get confused about the diff erence between tint and 
opacity. Tint is a screened (lighter) version of a color and is not transparent, but opaque. 
Opacity is the way you control the transparency of an object. Adjusting the transparency 
allows objects below to show through the object that is transparent or semi-transparent. 
Using these tools, you can apply many eff ects to images. For example, placing a red frame 
over a grayscale image and changing the opacity to 50 percent makes the image appear as 
if it has been colored. This is a task you might think is more suitable for Photoshop, but 
InDesign can give you that kind of control. Practice on a few objects now.

Highlight 100 percent in the Opacity fi eld of the Eff ects panel and type 40. This is yet 
another way to change the opacity of an object, without using the slider. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to implement the change in opacity. The bar, with 
an opacity of 40 percent, is slightly more transparent than the frame, which has an 
opacity value of 65 percent.

Lesson 8, Using Eff ects
Creative eff ects 
Apply effects to stroke or fill only 
In InDesign, an eff ect can be applied to an entire object, or to an object’s stroke, fi ll, or 
text individually. 
1 
Use the Selection tool ( ) to select the white box containing a quote in the upper-left 
corner of page 7.
2 
In the Eff ects panel, click the right-facing triangle next to Opacity to reveal the slider, 
then drag the slider left to 50 percent. Click the triangle again to commit the change. 
Notice that both the text and the fi ll are now fairly transparent. Applying the eff ect to 
the entire object in this way makes the text diffi  cult to read, which is something you 
don’t want. The text needs to stand out and remain legible.
Apply the opacity change to both the fi ll and text.
3 
Before you can apply the opacity change to the fi ll only, you must undo the last step. 
Either highlight 50 percent in the Opacity text fi eld in the Eff ects panel and type 
100 to return to the previous settings, or press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z 
(Mac OS) to undo the previous action.
4 
In the Eff ects panel, click to target the Fill listing. Selecting the Fill property ensures 
that the opacity applies only to the fi ll inside the frame and not to the text.

Click to reveal the Opacity slider, and drag it to the left to 50 percent. Commit 
the change by clicking the triangle again after setting the new value. The fi ll is 
transparent, but the text keeps an opacity value of 100 percent.
Adjust the opacity of the box’s fi ll only.
Drop shadow 
As with opacity, you can apply the drop shadow eff ect to a whole object or to just the 
stroke, fi ll, or text of the object. A drop shadow creates a three-dimensional shadow eff ect 
below whatever you have chosen in the document. You can also change such parameters 
as the drop shadow’s color, off set, and blending mode, to name a few. This exercise 
demonstrates the eff ect and provides you with your fi rst look inside the Eff ects dialog box.

A drop shadow is one of many eff ects that can be applied in the Eff ects dialog box.
4 
When the Eff ects dialog box opens, check the Preview checkbox in the bottom-left 
corner. Look at the change: InDesign applies a drop shadow to the frame because it 
has a fi ll of paper. If there were no fi ll color or stroke color, it would have applied a 
drop shadow to the text. Because InDesign lets you apply an eff ect to the fi ll, stroke, 
or text individually, you will adjust the settings in the Eff ects dialog box in the next 
step so that only the text gets the drop shadow.

Lesson 8, Using Eff ects
Creative eff ects 
Adjusting effects for objects
All InDesign’s eff ects are nondestructive. In other words, when you implement an eff ect, 
you always have the option of turning it on or off , as well as re-editing it. You can, for 
example, change the Drop Shadow eff ect you applied to the text in the previous exercise. 
In this exercise, you will change the position of the drop shadow and add the Use Global 
Light eff ect, which makes any lighting eff ects consistent across the entire document. In 
other words, all drop shadows and other lighting eff ects appear as if they have the same light 
source. When the Use Global Light eff ect is on and you alter the drop shadow’s position, 
all instances of the eff ect change. Think of a light shining in a room: if the light source 
changes position, all the shadows and highlights in the room also change accordingly.
1 
Continuing from where you left off  in the previous exercise, be sure that the box 
containing the words Johnny Guitar rocks again! is still selected. Double-click the eff ects 
symbol (
) next to the Text listing inside the Eff ects panel, to open the Eff ects dialog 
box. Once you apply an eff ect, this symbol appears in the Eff ects panel next to the 
component of the document to which the eff ect was applied. This instance of the 
eff ects symbol appears because of the drop shadow you applied to the text earlier. By 
double-clicking the symbol, you can edit the eff ects you applied.
Double-click the fx symbol next to the 
Text listing in the Eff ects panel to open 
the Eff ects dialog box.

Type 0p7 (7 points) in the Distance text fi eld. The Distance parameter controls how 
far from an object the drop shadow appears.
Turn on Use Global Light and set the drop shadow’s Distance parameter in the Eff ects panel.
If you are not familiar with working in picas and would rather work in inches, simply right-click 
(Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) the ruler and change the unit of measurement. The 
Distance fi eld should then be set to 0.0972 inches.
4 
Click OK to apply the changes and close the Eff ects dialog box. The Drop Shadow changes 
from its former position to be consistent with other lighting eff ects in the document.
Global Light coordinates all transparency eff ects that use shading, such as Drop Shadow, Inner 
Shadow, or Bevel and Emboss. Eff ects that use Global Light will have the light source angle and 
altitude synchronized across the entire document. Angle represents the direction that the light source 
is coming from. The Altitude setting, used for Bevel and Emboss, indicates how close the light 
source is to the object. Change the direction of the light source on any object’s eff ect, and all other 
eff ects controlled by Global Light will adjust accordingly. Using Global Light gives the appearance 
of a common light source shining on the objects, adding consistency and realism to the eff ects.

3 
When the Eff ects dialog box appears, leave the settings at their defaults and click 
OK to apply a Bevel and Emboss lighting eff ect to the star. Press Ctrl+(plus sign) 
(Windows) or Command+(plus sign) (Mac OS) to zoom in on the stars and compare 
the changed star with the others. Now you’ll apply the same eff ect to the second star, 
taking advantage of the ability to drag-and-drop. 
Apply the Bevel and Emboss eff ect to one of the stars.
4 
With the fi rst star still selected, take a look at the Eff ects panel. To the right of the 
Objects entry is the same eff ects symbol (
) that appeared next to the Text entry 
when you applied the drop shadow. Click and drag the symbol from the Eff ects panel 
into the layout and over the second-from-left star. When the cursor, which now looks 
like a hand with a plus sign over it (
), is positioned over the star, release the mouse 
to apply the Bevel and Emboss eff ect. Dragging and dropping is an easy way to reapply 
an eff ect without having to work within the Eff ects dialog box. InDesign off ers even 
more ways to apply eff ects. In the next exercise, you will apply Bevel and Emboss 
using object styles.
Simply drag and drop the eff ect to apply Bevel and Emboss to the second star.

Object styles with effects
In Lesson 4, “Working with Styles,” and Lesson 5, “Working with Graphics,” you explored 
using object styles to record stroke, fi ll, and paragraph styles. With InDesign, you can also 
use object styles to record and apply eff ects. As with other style attributes, a change to an 
eff ect is refl ected wherever you applied the style. In the next exercise, you will record an 
object style for the Bevel and Emboss eff ect and apply it to the rest of the stars. 
1 
On page 6, select the fi rst star using the Selection tool ( ).
2 
Choose Window > Styles > Object Styles, or click the Object Styles button ( ) in the 
dock, to open the Object Styles panel. From the Object Styles panel menu (
), choose 
New Object Style. 
3 
In the New Object Style dialog box, type Embossed in the Style Name text fi eld to 
name the new style. Although the style automatically inherits all eff ects applied to the 
selected object, you can choose which of them you want to save with the style.
Notice the section in the bottom-left corner of the dialog box that details all the 
eff ects currently applied to the selected object, in this case Transparency and Bevel 
and Emboss. Before you save the style, you can turn these on and off  individually by 
clicking the check box next to each attribute. For now, leave them as they are.

Basic Feather 
Feathering fades the transparency of an object’s border from opaque to invisible over a 
distance along the edges. Instead of using Photoshop to feather an image’s border, you can 
use InDesign. You can produce some pleasing eff ects by softening the edge of an image to 
make it appear as if the image fades into the page. Another feature is Directional Feathering, 
which allows you to control which side of an image or a colored frame receives the feather. 
The Basic Feather eff ect’s settings include Corners, which determines how the corners of 
the feather appear; Noise, which sets how smooth or textured the feather transition appears; 
and Choke, which controls how much of the feather is opaque or transparent. 
In this exercise, you will apply a Basic Feather eff ect to the image on page 6, and then use 
the Gradient Feather tool to apply a one-sided feather to the image on page 7.

), indicating that the eff ect will be applied. You may need to aim for the edge of a frame 
(rather than the center) to get the eff ect to transfer.
The Gradient Feather tool
The Gradient Feather tool eases the transition of an object’s opacity, from fully opaque to 
fully transparent. In this section, you will use the tool to fade the bottom of the Garage 
Band image on page 7 to transparency. In the previous exercise, Basic Feather applied the 
feather to all sides equally. InDesign also has a Directional Feather eff ect to adjust each 
feathered edge separately. You can use the Gradient Feather tool to dynamically fade one 
side of an image to transparency without aff ecting the other sides. You also have control 
over the angle at which the gradient eff ect is applied. By using this tool, you can click 
and drag as many times as you like, adjusting the gradient feather to whichever angle you 
want, without a dialog box.

Converting text to a path 
Here you’ll learn how to modify the text so that instead of fi lling it with a standard color, 
you fi ll it with a photo, producing a cool eff ect that’s fairly simple to implement. You 
cannot place an image directly into text while it is still editable; you can only place an 
image into text after it is converted to outlines.
You can use the Type menu’s Create Outlines command to convert the original font 
outline information into a set of compound paths. Compound paths are separate paths 
combined into a single object. In this exercise, you will convert the letters GB on page 7 
to compound paths and place a photo inside them.
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click the box on page 7 that contains GB. 
Make sure you did not accidentally select the type with the Type tool; although you can still 
convert text to outlines this way, it will create an in-line graphic. Although this technique can be 
useful in some cases, it could make it hard to modify and position the outlined text.

Applying blending modes to objects
If you have ever placed a black logo with a white background on a colored page, and then 
wondered how to get rid of the white background, you’ll appreciate blending modes. 
While there are several ways you can resolve this using InDesign, in this exercise you will 
discover how to use blending modes to manipulate a logo.
Blending modes aff ect how color pixels on one level blend with color pixels on the levels 
and layers below it. The two most commonly used blending modes are Multiply and 
Screen. You can remember what they do in the following way: Multiply blends out the 
white; Screen blends out the black. In more detailed terms, Multiply looks at the color 
information for the items and multiplies the base color by the blend color. The outcome 
is always a darker color. Screen examines each item’s color information and multiplies the 
inverse of the blend and base colors. The outcome is always a lighter color. 

8
Applying blending modes to objects
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
306
In the next two exercises, you will practice applying Screen and Multiply to examine how 
blending modes work.
The Screen blending mode
The Screen blending mode is useful for colorizing the black within an image. You will 
apply a Screen blending mode to the blue box that’s part of the record albums image on 
page 7 to give the records below the box a blue tint. 
1 
With the Selection tool ( ), click the blue box in the lower-right corner of page 7. This 
box is the one you altered in the fi rst opacity exercise. Because InDesign eff ects are 
editable, you will remove the opacity.
2 
Choose Window > Eff ects or open the Eff ects panel from the dock, reveal the 
Opacity slider (click on the right-facing triangle next to the settings), and drag it to 
100 percent. Click the triangle again to commit the value. The blue box covering the 
records image becomes solid blue.
Return the box’s opacity to 100 percent 
in the Eff ects panel.

8
307
Lesson 8, Using Eff ects
Applying blending modes to objects
3 
To the left of the Opacity setting in the Eff ects panel is the Blending Mode drop-down 
menu. It is currently set to Normal. Click Normal to reveal the other options, and 
choose Screen. The color of the blue box is now blending with the image of the records. 
Once you change the blending mode to Screen, the records look blue where they were formerly black.
Remember that the Screen eff ect drops the black out of an image, so if you put a Screen blending 
mode on the blue box, the black parts of the image beneath the box appear blue.
The Multiply blending mode
You will now work with an image that has so far been hidden on a layer. You will use the 
Multiply blending mode to visually remove the logo’s white area, while leaving the black 
areas unchanged.
1 
From the Pages panel, double-click page 6 to center it on the page.
2 
Click the Layers button (
) in the dock. There is a hidden layer called Johnny that 
you will need for this exercise and the next one.

8

Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
308
3 
Click in the leftmost box to the left of the Johnny layer to make that layer visible. An 
image of Johnny Guitar appears on page 6. On his T-shirt, in the upper-right corner 
of the image, is a swirly J and G—his signature and logo.
When the visibility icon is turned on 
next to a layer, the layer is visible.
4 
Select the signature using the Selection tool ( ).
5 
Open the Eff ects panel, if necessary, and from the Blending Mode drop-down menu 
at the top of the panel, choose Multiply. The white box around the logo disappears 
and the logo appears directly on Johnny’s T-shirt. 
Applying the Multiply eff ect blends Johnny Guitar’s logo with his shirt.
Because Multiply blends away the white, applying it is a handy trick to get rid of only the 
white in black-and-white images. This blending mode does not work with full-color images that 
have white around them, because it tries to blend white throughout the image, making it appear 
transparent or blended into the colors beneath.
As you’ll learn in the next section, there are alternative ways to achieve this same 
eff ect, such as using a clipping path or alpha channel selection.

Lesson 8, Using Eff ects
Working with imported fi les that use transparency
Working with imported files that use transparency
If you have worked through the previous lessons in this book, you probably have noticed 
that incorporating images created or modifi ed in Photoshop into InDesign is a well-
established part of a production workfl ow. In this exercise, you look at the ways that 
InDesign supports transparency in images edited in Photoshop.
Photoshop has a number of ways to defi ne areas of transparency in an image. While 
Photoshop is not required for this lesson, there are concepts such as alpha channels, 
clipping paths, and selections that are worth investigating in Photoshop and that can help 
you get the most out of this lesson.
The choice of using alpha channels or clipping paths depends on which tools you are more 
comfortable using and the content of your image. As a rule, paths are cleaner because they are 
created using vectors, which give you nice, smooth curves, while an alpha channel selection is 
based on pixels and gives you an edge that is choppier yet more realistic in some cases. For 
example, if you were removing the background of a product such as a television or soda can, vector 
paths would be the better choice. However if you are removing the background from a person, 
especially around their hair, an alpha channel might be the better choice. Know that regardless of 
which method you choose in the clipping options in InDesign, a vector edge will be created.
In this next exercise, you will place two images with diff erent types of transparency. The 
fi rst image simply has a transparent background, and the second has an alpha channel 
and a clipping path that were created in Photoshop. After learning how to control these 
transparent areas in InDesign, you will examine how transparency interacts with text wrap.
1 
Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Command+A (Mac OS) to deselect all 
objects in the document. In the Layers panel, select Layer 1.
2 
Open the Pages panel from the dock and double-click page 7 to select it. You will be 
placing a photo on this page. Double-click the Zoom tool (
), if necessary, to view 
the page at 100 percent.
3 
Use the Mini Bridge to navigate to the Links folder within the id08lessons folder,

The cursor now contains a thumbnail image of the fi le being placed. In the second 
column of page 7’s Allison Copper story, click in the white space to place the image. 
Using the Selection tool, click and drag to move the picture into position.
Use the Selection tool to position the image on page 7.
Move the image over some text; notice that it does not have a white background. 
Instead, the fi le has a transparent layer. InDesign automatically recognized the .psd 
fi le’s transparency. Adjust the image position to match the example above.

Lesson 8, Using Eff ects
Working with imported fi les that use transparency
Applying an alpha channel selection
The photo of the band members (id0802.psd) contains an alpha channel selection that was 
saved in Photoshop. An alpha channel is a way to save a selection you created in Photoshop 
so that you can later access it in InDesign for visibility and text wrap options. Alpha 
channels are stored, along with the color channels of an RGB or CMYK image, to capture 
a selection or indicate transparency. In this exercise, you will access an alpha channel using 
the Clipping Paths option. A clipping path is another term for the visibility edge that 
exists with this type of partially transparent image. Consider the outline of the two band 
members. This outline represents the clipping path; all areas inside the path are opaque, 
while all areas outside the path are transparent.
You could use InDesign’s Detect Edges feature, which would build a path for you around the two 
band members based on the transparency or background contrast, but an even more accurate way 
is to access the saved alpha channel selection that is already made for you.
1 
Make sure you still have the band photo selected. If it is not, select the image using the 
Selection tool ( ), and then choose Object > Clipping Path > Options.
Choose Clipping Path > Options in the Object menu.

default is Transparency, based on the transparent pixels of the fi le. Click to turn on the 
Preview checkbox to see the path you created from the alpha channel. This path is also 
helpful when applying the text wrap.
Choose Alpha Channel and rockers in the Clipping Path dialog box.

Click OK to accept the path shown in the preview and close the dialog box. Next you 
will apply a text wrap around the alpha channel selection.

around the image’s shape rather than its bounding box. In the Text Wrap panel, enter 
an off set value of 10 pt (.1389 in.) or experiment with diff erent values, and then close 
the Text Wrap panel.
Notice that in the Contour Options section of the Text Wrap panel, the default Type setting is 
Same as Clipping. Although this is useful, it is possible to choose another contour method for 
the text wrap that is totally separate from what is used for the clipping. This opens up a world of 
possibilities to you as the designer.

Applying a path selection
A path selection is a selection made and saved in Photoshop using the Pen tool. You can 
access these selections in InDesign the same way you select a .psd fi le’s alpha channel. Pen 
tool selections are cleaner than alpha channels in InDesign because they are vector paths 
and InDesign doesn’t need to create this path on its own. Alpha channel selections are 
based on pixels, and InDesign makes the path for you. You will now apply a pre-made 
path to Johnny Guitar and apply a text wrap again.
1 
Open the Pages panel from the dock, and double-click page 6 to bring it into view.
2 
Select the image of Johnny Guitar using the Selection tool.

Click OK. Notice how the black around the image disappears based on the saved 
Photoshop path. Now you can apply the text wrap.
With the path applied, you’re ready to wrap text around Johnny.

Self study
Here are some projects you can create on your own:
• Apply a drop shadow to Johnny Guitar and choose Use Global Light to coordinate the 
eff ects throughout the document. Then adjust the direction of the Drop Shadow eff ect 
and watch the headline drop shadow update as well.
• Select the top photo on page 7, and remove the Gradient Feather eff ect. Try to 
accomplish the same eff ect with Directional Feathering.
• Apply more eff ects to Johnny Guitar, save the result as an object style, and then apply 
that style to the images of Johnny and Allison Copper. Change the object style so that 
both images update simultaneously.
• Experiment with blending modes by making a colored frame over Tommy Acustomas; 
then change the Blending modes and Opacity settings to get diff erent eff ects.

Questions
1 
Can you alter an eff ect after you’ve applied it?
2 
What is the diff erence between opacity and tint?
3 
If you apply Create Outlines to type, can you still edit the text with the Type tool?
4 
Can you feather only one edge of a photograph?
Answers
1 
Yes, you can always return to the Eff ects panel, select the eff ect again, and double-
click the eff ect to make adjustments.
2 
Tint is a screened (lighter) version of a color, and is not transparent. Opacity achieves 
a similar result; however, it allows objects behind the transparent object to show 
through.
3 
No, if Create Outlines is applied, the text is made into paths and is no longer related 
to the font information.
4 
Yes, with the Directional Feather eff ect or the Gradient Feather tool, you can control 
the angle and direction of a feather to include only one of the image’s edges.

Lesson 9, Advanced Document Features
Lesson 9
Although the lessons so far have used single, small documents as 
examples, InDesign can manage complex, book-length documents, 
and maintain consistency across multiple fi les. The software’s 
advanced document features enable you to add dynamic text, cross-
reference and index information, and synchronize many fi les at once. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in the Starting up 
section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the id09lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have copied the id09lessons folder onto your hard drive from the Digital Classroom 
DVD. See “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. This lesson may 
be easier to follow if the id09lessons folder is on your desktop.

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
The project
In this lesson, you will work with several chapters of a book to see for yourself the 
capabilities of InDesign’s book feature. You will add chapters to a book fi le, and update the 
page number of each page based on its position in the book. Using text variables, you will 
automate the generation of elements on each page, which can save hours of manual work. 
You will then synchronize each chapter to give the book a consistent appearance.
Adding text variables
InDesign enables you to add dynamic text called variables to your documents. In a general 
sense, a variable is a way to store information that is not necessarily permanent. In InDesign, 
a variable is text-based content that dynamically changes when certain criteria are met or 
specifi c changes occur in the document. For example, you might want a running footer in 
the document that contains the title of the chapter. Traditionally, you would type the static 
text on a master page for the content to appear properly. Inserting a variable provides a more 
powerful option. In this case, using a variable would automatically update all footer text 
when the chapter title is modifi ed.
When you place a text variable on a page, you must place it within a text frame, just like 
normal text. That frame can be in the live, printable area of the documents or in the non-
printing portion. In this exercise, you will use text variables in a non-printing area to 
display the fi lename and modifi cation date of the documents, which can be helpful in a 
collaborative environment.

In InDesign, choose File > Open. Navigate to the id09lessons folder, choose 
TOC.indd, and click Open. Notice the light blue outline that extends beyond the edge 
of the page on the right side. This area is called the slug, and information entered here 
doesn’t automatically print on the fi nal page. You will use the slug area to house the 
fi lename and modifi cation date variables, displaying the name of the fi le and the date it 
was modifi ed. This is useful when viewing a printout of a document or when viewing 
it onscreen to determine when the most recent edit or modifi cation was made.
About the trim and slug area
A slug is information placed outside of the final print area of the document. The final print 
area is known as the trim area, and the space immediately outside of where a document will 
be trimmed (cut) is the slug area. The slug may contain the job name, client name, a place 
for approval of the job, or colors used in the job. Slugs can be included when printing or 
generating PDF files from InDesign. The slug prints only when you choose Include Slug Area 
in the Marks and Bleed section of the Print dialog box or the Export Adobe PDF dialog box.
2 
Select the Type tool ( ) from the Tools panel, and then click and drag to create a text 
frame within the top of the slug area on the page. Be careful to keep the frame within 
the slug’s bounds.
The slug area can hold information that will not show up in the fi nal 
printed project but can appear when printed.

Open the Paragraph Styles panel by choosing Window > Styles > Paragraph Styles 
or by clicking the Paragraph Styles button ( ) in the dock on the right side of the 
workspace. Before inserting text or typing into this frame, choose the Variable Text 
style from the Paragraph Styles panel. This assigns the Variable Text style to text you 
type in the frame, and gives the text a standard appearance. Make sure the cursor is 
blinking in the text box before you choose this style.
4 
With the cursor inside the text frame, choose Type > Text Variables > Insert 
Variable > File Name to insert the value of the File Name variable in the slug area’s 
text frame. Because you’re working in the fi le TOC.indd, InDesign inserts TOC in 
the frame. Choose File > Save.
5 
Press the Enter key (Windows) or Return key (Mac OS) on your keyboard to move 
the cursor under the fi lename text you inserted in the previous step, then choose 
Type > Text Variables > Insert Variable > Modifi cation Date. InDesign inserts the 
value of the second variable, Modifi cation Date, beneath TOC in the text frame. The 
Modifi cation Date’s value refl ects the time and date of the fi le’s most recent save, and 
because you saved the document in the last step, the current date and time appear.
Later in the lesson, you will see how the File Name and Modifi cation Date variables 
can be useful in a production environment. A quick look at the variable text tells 
which fi le you’re working in and whether the fi le has been updated recently.
Text variables can provide dynamic information about the document.
Usually, when text variables are used, you’ll want to modify or customize the variable 
so it appears in the correct way. In the next steps, you’ll customize the File Name 
variable.

Creating a book from multiple files
Any project that contains numerous pages, whether it’s a book, magazine, or other long 
document, can be large and cumbersome. Not only is fi le size an issue—especially if the 
project contains a lot of graphics—but the more pages the document contains, the more 
challenging it is to navigate through the document. InDesign’s Book feature off ers some 
help. The Book feature enables you to divide up a project into smaller, more manageable 
sections or chapters. It also boasts a number of document management capabilities that 
allow for easy navigation between sections and maintain consistency from one fi le to the 
next. You can also have diff erent people work on diff erent fi les, and use the Book feature 
to join the fi les together into one project.
To demonstrate the Book feature, you will work with fi ve fi les that represent the diff erent 
chapters of a work in progress. An important task in managing a large job like this is to 
create a book fi le.

If you don’t have the Times New Roman font loaded on your system, you may receive 
a warning that the pages will recompose using a substituted font and the resulting page 
numbers may not be accurate. Click the Don’t Show Again checkbox to avoid viewing 
this dialog box in the future, and then click OK. You will fi x the fonts later in this 
exercise when you synchronize the book. If requested, save the fi les. InDesign now 
lists the documents in the Book panel. Although the documents in the Book panel are 
still separate fi les, they are now being managed by the Book panel and are now related 
to each other.
Add the documents from the id09lessons folder to 
the Book panel.
Defining pagination and document order
When you choose fi les from the Add Document dialog box, InDesign adds them to the 
Book panel and adjusts the page numbers within each document so they are sequentially 
numbered. Unfortunately, this does not always match the logical sequence for your 
documents. For example, in this book, the TOC and Index fi les should be fi rst and last, 
respectively, in the panel. Because InDesign adds fi les to the Book panel in numerical, 
then alphabetical order, based on each document’s fi lename, they are currently fourth and 
fi fth in the list. Rearranging the fi le order is a simple matter of clicking and dragging. 
Once a book’s pages are in order, you can turn your attention to the pagination within 
the fi les. Do you need the book documents to open on left pages, for example? InDesign’s 
Book Page Numbering Options help you tweak the document fl ow.
In this exercise, you will resolve some typical pagination issues, rearrange fi les, and 
explore the Book Page Numbering Options dialog box.

Make sure that the Automatically Update Page & Section Numbers check box 
is selected. This tells InDesign to update pagination and section numbering 
automatically when pages are added, removed, or rearranged. For example, if new 
pages are added to documents at the start of the book, the pages in the following 
documents will be updated. Click OK. A progress bar may appear while InDesign 
rearranges and adds pages to the documents as needed. The page numbers in the Book 
panel adjust to refl ect the changes.
Control pagination within the Book Page Numbering Options dialog box, which is available in 
the Book panel menu.

Scroll down the Book panel and note that the pages are numbered consecutively at 
this point. The book numbering fl ows from one chapter to the next.

Double-click on the 2_Flowers document to open it, and notice that the document 
now begins on the left side (the even page). Close the document.
Synchronizing attributes across a book file
When multiple people collaborate on fi les for a large project, inconsistencies sometimes 
sneak in, no matter how well coworkers try to keep each other informed. Diff erent colors 
may be used, styles may be defi ned diff erently, and fonts might even vary from one part 
of a document to another. The Book feature solves these hard-to-trace problems by 
synchronizing elements to maintain consistency across the documents within the book 
fi le. InDesign can synchronize the following items:
• Styles, including character, paragraph, object, table, cell, and TOC styles
• Swatches
• Numbered lists
• Text variables
• Conditional text settings
• Cross-reference formats
• Trap presets
• Master pages

In the design process, it isn’t always feasible to start from a template with established master 
pages and styles, but it defi nitely helps when using the Book feature in InDesign. You can, 
however, create a base set of styles, such as body, subhead, and so on, and then synchronize 
all the related documents to these styles and any other attributes agreed upon later.
The book fi les in this lesson suff er from their own inconsistencies: The text and look of each 
document diff ers, which is the result of multiple designers using fonts unique to their system. 
This, in turn, creates confl icts in the chapters that need to be resolved. In this exercise, you 
will fi x these discrepancies to establish cross-document consistency in the book.
1 
Double-click the 1_Trees listing in the Book panel to open it. Update any modifi ed 
links, if necessary. Notice the word Chapter at the top of page 3. You want the chapter 
number to appear next to the word for all the interior chapters in the book. To do 
this, you will use a variable.
2 
Click the Pages button (
) in the dock to open the Pages panel. Double-click on the 
right page icon of the A-Chapter Intro master page in the Pages panel. This displays 
the contents of the right-hand master page for the chapter.
Double-click on the right page icon of 
the A-Chapter Intro master page.

Now you’re ready to synchronize attributes across multiple chapters. If necessary, 
click in the column to the left of the 1_Trees document name in the Book panel. This 
column selects the style source of your book. The style source is the document to 
which all other documents in the book synchronize.
The style source icon indicates the document to which 
all other documents synchronize.
7 
Before you synchronize documents, you must specify the synchronize options. From 
the Book panel menu ( ), choose Synchronize Options. In the resulting Synchronize 
Options dialog box, you can specify which styles or elements to synchronize. For this 
project, make sure all options are selected. Click OK.
Choose synchronize options for the book.
8 
In the Book panel, click 1_Trees, and then Shift+click 3_Plants to select all three of 
the interior chapters. You won’t use Select All, because you don’t want to synchronize 
the TOC or index.

Click the Synchronize styles and swatches using the Style Source icon ( ) at the 
bottom of the Book panel to initiate the synchronization of the selected chapters.
Select the documents and click the Synchronize styles and 
swatches with the style source icon to begin synchronization.
You may receive messages during synchronization that indicate some text has become 
overset or non–overset. Overset means that the text no longer fi ts into the text frame that 
contains it. Accept these messages by clicking OK. When fi nished, InDesign displays a 
message to convey that synchronization completed successfully and that some documents 
may have changed. InDesign changes the styles, master pages, and so on, in the selected 
documents to match those of the style source document. Here synchronization changed 
the defi nition of the paragraph styles to match the style source.
Successful synchronization.
10 Click OK to accept the synchronization. To confi rm the changes, click, then double-
click to open the 2_Flowers document. If necessary, update any links. The chapter 
introductory pages now feature the appropriate chapter number because you included 
master pages in the synchronization options. The body text matches that of the style 
source document and the Times New Roman font no longer exists in any of the 
documents. Similar changes were applied to the 3_Plants fi le. 
To add the fi nishing touches, you’ll change the names of the chapters to refl ect the actual 
name of each chapter, as each fi le had originally started from the same template fi le.
11 Go to page 9 of the 2_Flowers document and, using the Selection tool, press 
Shift+Ctrl (Windows) or Shift+Command (Mac OS) while you click the green title 
bar at the top of the page. This overrides the item from the master page so you can 
edit it. For information on master pages, refer to Lesson 2, “Building Documents with

15 Double-click to open 1_Trees, and Shift+Ctrl+click (Windows) or 
Shift+Command+click (Mac OS) on the green title bar at the top of the page to detach 
it from the master page. This is the Trees chapter, so don’t change any of the text. The 
chapter title must be detached from the master page in preparation for the next exercise.
Now that the document has been synchronized, you have established consistency 
throughout the pages of the book. As the book grows, and documents are added, you 
can synchronize the book again to ensure consistency of styles and pages in those new 
documents.
16 Choose File > Save, and then choose File > Close to close the Trees chapter.
Creating Captions
InDesign has a powerful captions feature that allows you to automatically generate 
captions for images that have been placed into a document based on the metadata 
embedded in the image. There are photos on the fi rst spread of every chapter in the book 
that need a photo credit applied. In the following steps, you’ll set-up the captions and 
generate them for each photo.
1 
Double click the 1_Trees fi le in the Book panel to open it. In the Pages panel, double-
click page 2 to go to that page. You’ll add a photo credit for this image.
2 
Choose Object > Captions > Caption Setup. In order to control how a caption is 
created, you need to setup the parameters in this dialog box. In the Text Before fi eld, 
type Photo Credit: followed by a space.
3 
In the Metadata drop-down menu, choose Author from the list. This is the metadata 
that will be pulled from the image to generate the caption.

Metadata Explained
Metadata is information about an image or file that doesn’t generally appear as part of the 
files content. Metadata generally describes information about a file that can be useful for a 
number of purposes. In the case of photos, metadata can help you find information such as 
the camera that was used to take the photo, when the photo was taken, and in some cases, 
where the photo was taken. In the case of this lesson, we used the metadata of some of the 
photos to generate captions for the images. Some metadata information is embedded into the 
photo by the camera that took the picture. Metadata can also be added by the user to identify 
products or people who are in the image to make it easier to find the image later on.
One of the easiest ways to add metadata to a file or image is using the Adobe Bridge 
application. The Adobe Bridge allows you to quickly and easily add metadata information to 
a photo to identify the properties of the photo.

Creating Captions
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom

There are two parts to generating a caption from an image. The fi rst step is to set the 
parameters in the Caption Setup dialog box as you completed in the previous step. The 
second step is to generate the caption for each image.
5 
Select the image on page 2 with your selection tool, then choose Object > Captions > 
Generate Live Caption. The caption should appear along the left edge of the photo and 
should read Photo Credit: istockphoto.com. Chose File > Save and then File > Close.
The caption has been automatically generated and positioned in relation to the photo.
6 
Repeat steps 2 through 5 in the 2_Flowers and 3_Plants documents to create photo 
credit captions in those documents as well.
Live vs. Static Captions
InDesign allows you to create two different types of captions: Live Captions and Static 
Captions. Live Captions update dynamically whenever you make changes to the metadata 
from an image used to generate the Live Caption. Static captions, by contrast, only use the 
metadata one time when generating the caption. From there on, the caption will not update 
if the metadata in the image updates.
Regardless of the dynamic advantage of Live Captions over Static Captions, you can’t use 
Live Captions all the time because of a limitation: they cannot traverse more than one line. If 
a Live Caption extends beyond the length of the frame that contains the caption, the text will 
compress to fit within the given area. Static Captions, on the other hand, can traverse more 
than one line, but will not update dynamically.

Lesson 9, Advanced Document Features
Creating a Table of Contents
 Creating a Table of Contents
A book needs a Table of Contents, and InDesign helps you build one by automating its 
creation and formatting. For the Table of Contents feature to work, however, you must 
prepare the fi les correctly. For example, you must use paragraph styles throughout the 
document or book, and you must also create styles to format the text in the Table of 
Contents itself. The TOC document in this lesson already contains these styles. In this 
exercise, you’ll use these styles and the Table of Contents feature to generate and format a 
Table of Contents. 
1 
Double-click the TOC document in the Book panel to open it. 
2 
Choose Window > Styles > Paragraph Styles to open the Paragraph Styles panel. In 
the Paragraph Styles panel, notice that several styles begin with the prefi x TOC. You 
will use these to style the Table of Contents text. The styles you used to style the text 
of the chapters have not yet been synchronized. To create a Table of Contents, you’ll 
load those styles into the TOC document by performing another synchronization. 
3 
Click the Book panel menu button ( ) and choose Synchronize Options to open the 
Synchronize Options dialog box.
4 
Uncheck all the options except for Paragraph Styles and Character Styles to instruct 
InDesign to synchronize only these attributes. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Tell InDesign exactly which attributes you would like to synchronize.
5 
Make sure that the Style Source is set to the 1_Trees document in the Book panel (by 
clicking in the column to the left of the document name), and then Shift+click TOC 
and 1_Trees to select them for synchronizing.

completed successfully, and that documents may have changed, click OK. Notice 
that several new styles have been imported into the TOC document during 
synchronization. Now you are ready to generate the Table of Contents for the book. 
7 
With the TOC.indd document open, choose Layout > Table of Contents. The Table 
of Contents dialog box appears. 
8 
In the area for Title in the dialog box, confi rm the title is entered as Contents. If 
necessary, enter this as the title. This is the name that appears at the start of the Table

From the Style drop-down menu, choose TOC_Contents. This paragraph style 
defi nes how the title is formatted.
The top portion of the Table of Contents dialog box controls the title and title style of the Table of Contents.
10 The Styles in Table of Contents section is where you choose which styles in the 
document or book will appear in the Table of Contents. In the Other Styles list, click 
Chapter_Number to highlight it. Click the Add button to move the Chapter_Number 
style into the Include Paragraph Styles list. Highlight and click to add the 
Chapter_Head and Sub_Head styles as well, in that order.
In the Styles in Table of Contents section, specify which styles InDesign uses to pull content from the document or book.
11 Now you need to defi ne the attributes of each style’s appearance. Click the More 
Options button at the right side of the Table of Contents dialog box to expand the 
Style section. If you see a Fewer Options button, you don’t need to do anything, as the 
additional options are already displayed.
12 Click the Chapter_Number style in the Include Paragraph Styles list. The Style section 
below it is now labeled as Style: Chapter_Number. From the Entry Style drop-down 
menu, choose TOC_ChapterNumber, and from the Page Number drop-down menu, 
choose No Page Number.

14 Click the Include Book Documents check box at the bottom of the dialog box to have 
all document fi les in the Book included when the Table of Contents is generated. 
InDesign locates text formatted with the specifi ed styles you identifi ed in the Include 
Paragraph Styles list, and the styled text is used for the Table of Contents.
15 Click the Save Style button in the upper-right corner of the dialog box. In the 
resulting Save Style dialog box, type Book_TOC in the Save Style text fi eld, and 
click OK to save the settings that defi ne how the Table of Contents is created. This 
saves time if you ever have to generate another Table of Contents with these settings 
in the future. 
Clicking the Save Style button inside the Table of Contents dialog box captures the settings that 
you painstakingly confi gured for the Table of Contents. This can be useful if you have several 
versions of a document that each need their own Table of Contents, or if you made a mistake and 
later need to modify the settings.
16 Click OK in the Table of Contents dialog box to generate the Table of Contents for 
the book. A dialog box may appear, asking if you want to include items in overset 
text. Click OK. This ensures that if any of the text in the other documents is overset, 
it will still be included in the Table of Contents.
Overset text is text that appears in a frame that isn’t big enough to display it. This can happen 
for several reasons; often when text is added or adjusted, it will make the text within a frame run 
longer than the actual frame. For this reason, you generally want to include items in overset text 
when creating a Table of Contents to make sure that any overset type styles to be listed as TOC 
entries are included.

Building an index
Indexes are very complex components of a book. A good index is based on specifi c topics 
and can quickly direct you to the exact location of the information you need; a poorly 
created index is one that is confusing or unhelpful. InDesign doesn’t know what you 
want indexed, so it can’t automatically create an index for you. It can, however, make 
the process a lot easier. Using the Index panel, you can assemble an index with topics, 
references, and cross-references.

9
339
Lesson 9, Advanced Document Features
Building an index
To demonstrate what’s possible, two chapters of the example book have been indexed 
already. In this series of exercises, you’ll tackle the third chapter, adding index topics to 
categorize the references, supplementing these with cross-references to help direct your 
reader to the correct topic, and fi nally, generating the index.
Adding topics
The most basic component of an index is its topics. Although InDesign can’t help you 
with what to index, it makes adding the topics you choose a simple matter of pointing and 
clicking. Think of topics as categories into which entries will be sorted.
1 
In the Book panel, double-click to open 3_Plants, the fi le you need to index.
2 
Choose Window > Type & Tables > Index to open the Index panel.
3 
Make sure the Book checkbox in the upper-right corner of the Index panel is checked. 
This tells InDesign to look in all the documents within a book for references when 
generating the index.

letter of the alphabet appears at the bottom of the New Topic dialog box, and there 
is now a triangle next to P. If you click the triangle, the list expands and you see the 
word Plants has been added to the list of topics. In text fi eld 1 under Topic Levels, 
type Genus, and then click Add. Click the OK or Done button. You have now added 
Plants and Genus to the topic list of the index.
The new topics are added to the topic 
list of the index.

within the text.
10 Repeat steps 7 to 9 for the word Aloe on page 15 and the phrase Golden Ball Cacti on 
page 16. 
Now, in addition to the plant’s name, you need to add each plant’s scientifi c name to 
its Genus topic.
11 Double-click on page 14 in the Pages panel to go to that page. Highlight the scientifi c 
name Pennisetum alopecuroides and click the Create a new index entry button at the 
bottom of the Index panel. Click the down arrow icon to move the entry to the Topic 
Level 2 text fi eld. Click to select the Topic Level 1 text fi eld, then scroll down to the

to close the New Page Reference dialog box. Save the 3_Plants.indd document and 
keep the fi le open for the next exercise.
The Index Reference list shows what page 
each entry appears on in the documents.
Adding cross-references
Now that you’ve added all the necessary references to the index for the 3_Plants 
document, it’s time to think about adding cross-references to the index. Cross-references 
refer a reader to a similar topic if there are no entries for the topic being looked up. For 
example, someone may look up the topic grass in the index. It does not contain a topic for 
grass, but the index can refer the reader to the closest thing, which would be Fountain 
Grass. Try adding the cross-reference now.
1 
With the 3_Plants.indd document still open, choose New Cross-reference from the 
Index panel menu. If you see New Page Reference instead, deselect any text on the 
page by pressing Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Command+A (Mac OS), and then 
choose New Cross-reference from the Index panel menu. The New Cross-reference 
dialog box appears.
2 
In the list at the bottom of the New Cross-reference panel, scroll to the letter F and 
expand the topic by clicking on the triangle to its left. Double-click Fountain Grass to 
add it to the Topic Level 1 text fi eld.
3 
In the Referenced text fi eld, type Grass. This tells InDesign to direct the reader to 
the Fountain Grass topic when the word grass is referenced. This places an entry in the 
index under the topic Fountain Grass that says, See also Grass.

that check box is turned on, InDesign replaces the current index with the new index content.
Creating PDFs and printing from the Book panel
Now that you are fi nished working on your book, you may want to send the fi les to a 
coworker or client as proof of progress or for review. Because not everyone has InDesign, 
you can convert the InDesign documents to a fi le type that can be easily shared. 
InDesign’s Book panel simplifi es the process of creating PDF fi les and printing so you can 
easily share the project. 
Creating PDFs
Creating a PDF from a book fi le is quick and easy in InDesign, and the results can be 
read by anyone with Adobe Reader, a free download is available at get.adobe.com/reader. 
InDesign CS6 allows you to create PDF fi les for print output or for interactive output. 
You will now export the InDesign book as a PDF.

Self study
Work with other text variables available in InDesign to fi nd out other ways in which they 
can be used. The Running Header variable, for instance, allows you to defi ne a paragraph 
style within the document, whose content will appear where the Running Header variable 
is placed. This can save considerable time when working with long documents.
Create your own paragraph styles for the Table of Contents to change its appearance. Get 
creative by changing the fonts and paragraph spacing, and then choose Update Table of 
Contents to see the changes.
Add additional references to the index. Practice creating index references and cross-
references and then regenerate the index to apply the recent entries. With index copy, you 
can customize the appearance of the text by using paragraph styles. You can change these 
settings by clicking on the More Options button in the Generate Index dialog box.

Lesson 10, Prefl ighting, Printing and Creating PDFs from InDesign
Lesson 10
Designing your document is only half the job. You still need to 
deliver it, whether to a commercial printer, the Web, or colleagues and 
coworkers. To help you, InDesign off ers multiple methods for proofi ng 
and packaging your fi les, as well as fl exible export controls to PDF.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in the Starting up 
section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the id10lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have copied the id10lessons folder onto your hard drive from the Digital Classroom 
DVD. See “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. This lesson may 
be easier to follow if the id10lessons folder is on your desktop.
For this lesson, you need either Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader to view the PDF fi les you 
will create. If necessary, you can download the free Adobe Reader at get.adobe.com/reader.

See Lesson 10 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
The project
To sample the PDF and print-related controls off ered by InDesign, you will prepare a car 
ad for delivery to multiple customers. You’ll prefl ight the document using the InDesign 
Prefl ight feature and then package the document to send to a printer or other user. Finally, 
you will generate a PDF fi le of the complete project.
Package inventory
Before you send your fi les to a printer or other service provider, in order to print your 
job professionally, it’s important that you check the fi le for common errors that can occur 
during the design phase of your project. If your fi les aren’t prepared to the required 
specifi cations, your job could be delayed or, even worse, reproduced incorrectly. The 
InDesign CS6 Live Prefl ight feature enables you to check all the mechanics of your fi le to 
ensure that everything is in working order. You can even defi ne custom Prefl ight profi les 
in CS6 that will prefl ight your document to your or your printers’ specifi c needs. 
For example, say you’re planning to submit an ad for the new IDCS6 sports car to a 
newspaper. In this exercise, you’ll use Package to see the Package Inventory of the fi le, 
and then you’ll defi ne a Prefl ight setting to see how well your ad complies with the 
newspaper’s specifi cations.

Choose File > Package. InDesign analyzes the document, and displays a summary of 
its fi ndings in the Package Inventory dialog box. For more information on a specifi c 
category, click its name in the list on the left side of the dialog box.
The Package Inventory dialog box displays detailed information about your fi le, and fl ags 
potential errors that could cause problems.
3 
From the list on the left side of the dialog box, choose Fonts. The right side of the 
dialog box now lists all the fonts used in your document as well as their format and 
status. If the status is OK, the font is loaded onto your system and recognized by 
InDesign. A status of Missing indicates that the font cannot be found. Because this 
lesson fi le was created using fonts installed with InDesign, all your fonts should say OK.
4 
Choose Links and Images from the list on the left side of the dialog box. This section 
displays information about the images that are used within your document. At the 
top of this dialog box is a caution icon ( ), indicating that InDesign found a potential 
problem, specifi cally that one of the images uses the RGB color space. Most printing 
companies require images to be submitted in the CMYK color space; ask your printer 
for their specifi cations prior to sending your fi les. 
You can fi x this error manually by opening the RGB fi le in Adobe Photoshop and converting 
it to CMYK. In addition, you can carefully check the color conversion options set within 
InDesign to ensure that when output, the colors would convert properly based on your printers 
specifi cations.

The Links and Images section also indicates the state of your images, linked or 
unlinked, as well as the actual versus eff ective resolutions of your images.
Actual versus effective resolution
The resolution of an image is indicated by the number of pixels per inch (ppi) that make up the 
image—a seemingly simple concept that can be a bit complicated. As a general rule, the higher 
the resolution of an image, the higher its quality. Most images that you see when browsing the 
Internet are 72 ppi or 96 ppi, which is the standard screen resolution of most monitors. For 
high-quality printing, however, image resolution should generally be around 300 ppi.
To further complicate things, the Package window’s Links and Images section lists two 
different numbers at the bottom: actual ppi and effective ppi. Actual ppi is the actual 
resolution of the file that you are placing into InDesign. The effective ppi is the resolution 
of the image after it has been scaled in InDesign. For example, if you place a 300-ppi image 
in your document and then scale it 200 percent, the effective resolution becomes 150 ppi. As 
you increase the size of images in InDesign, the effective resolution decreases. The effective 
resolution is the number that you should pay most careful attention to, as it determines the 
quality at which the image is output.
The Links and Images section of the Package Inventory dialog box.

Select Colors and Inks in the Package list to see which ink colors the document uses. 
This fi le uses a color called Pantone 187 C. Any color besides cyan, magenta, yellow, 
or black is considered a spot color or plate. You’ll learn more about these later in the 
“Separation Preview” section. Click the Cancel button to close the Package dialog box. 
For more information on Pantone colors, see Lesson 7, “Using Color in Your Documents.”

Prefl ight checks 
Keep the fi le open, as you’ll need it for the next part of the lesson. Later in this lesson 
you’ll complete the packaging process and send it to the newspaper that is running 
the ad. Before doing this, you’ll Prefl ight the InDesign fi le to ensure that it meets the 
proper specifi cations.

Choose File > Save As. Navigate to the id10lessons folder and type 
CarAd_work.indd in the Name text fi eld. Click Save.
Preflight checks 
Like a pilot checking over their plane prior to takeoff , Prefl ight assesses your document, 
then reports potential problems—missing fonts, missing images, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) 
images, whether interactive elements are contained in the document and more—that 
could prevent a printer from outputting your job properly, or hinder a customer’s ability to 
view your fi le accurately. You can set up diff erent profi les for all the intended destinations 
of your documents. For example, you could defi ne a Prefl ight profi le for all the documents 
you create that will end up as just PDFs on the Web, which are not intended for high-end 
output. You could defi ne the profi le to look for images with a resolution over 100 ppi. 
Whenever a photo was placed that had a higher eff ective resolution than 100 ppi, an error 
would appear in the Prefl ight panel. You can also see the Prefl ight status in the bottom-
left area of your document window. In this exercise, you will defi ne a new profi le in the 
InDesign CS6 Prefl ight panel, and then check your document against the profi le.
1 
Choose Window > Output > Prefl ight. The Prefl ight panel opens. Right now, the 
Prefl ight profi le is set to Basic, which looks only for broken or missing links to images, 
inaccessible URL links, missing fonts in the document, or overset text. You will now 
defi ne a new profi le that will look for RGB images in the document.

now give you an error message for any RGB color that might fi nd its way into your 
document. To fi x this issue, you would need to open the problem image in Photoshop 
and change the color space to CMYK. But that is only if you are sending a Package 
to a printer. When exporting a PDF fi le, certain PDF settings would automatically 
change the color space of the RGB images to CMYK.

Creating a prefl ight profi le benefi ts you because that profi le exists on your computer 
but if you send this document to another user, they will not have the benefi t of being 
able to use this profi le. That is unless you embed the profi le into the active InDesign 
document so that it can be used by any user on any computer.

Click on the embed selected profi le button ( ) located directly to the right of the 
Profi le drop-down menu to embed the profi le into the document. The selected

Packaging your document
When you need to send your InDesign document out for review, alterations, or printing, 
you must be sure you’re sending all the necessary pieces. Without the font and image 
fi les used by the document, your coworkers or service provider can’t accurately see and 
reproduce the fi le as you intended. To avoid this frustrating scenario, turn to the InDesign 
Package feature. Package gathers all the document elements the recipient needs into one 
folder and even enables you to include an instruction fi le. In this exercise, you will use 
Package to collect the car ad’s fonts and graphics. 
1 
Choose File > Package. InDesign automatically runs Package Inventory and displays 
a warning if it fi nds problems. You’ve already seen the information in this dialog box 
earlier in this lesson, so simply click the Package button to proceed. 
The Package dialog box displays a summary of your document including information about 
links, fonts, and color.

In the Windows Explorer or Finder, navigate to the desktop, and double-click the 
CarAd folder. Inside, you’ll fi nd a copy of the document fi le, an instructions fi le, a 
Fonts folder with all the fonts used in the job, and a Links folder that contains all the 
graphics—all in one easy-to-send Package.
When the Package process is complete, all the project’s 
elements are displayed together in the CarAd folder.
Now that all the fi les required to reproduce your job have been copied to the location you specifi ed 
and are contained within their own folder, you can send this folder to another person to review, or 
to your printer or service provider to output your job. To ensure the integrity of the fi les and speed 
the transfer, compress the packaged folder before sending. The compressed fi le can then be shared 
through e-mail, uploading them to an FTP server, or using a service such as Adobe’s SendNow 
or another service such as DropBox.
Creating an Adobe PDF
The Package feature collects all your data fi les, but the recipients still must have InDesign 
to read the document. But what if they don’t?
The answer is to send a PDF fi le. PDF (Portable Document Format) is a common format 
that can be viewed and printed from any computer platform—Mac, Windows, Linux, 
and others—that has the free Adobe Reader program installed. A PDF fi le is an excellent 
way to make your project available for a wide range of users, and InDesign CS6 makes the 
process of creating a PDF fi le of your project very easy. In the following steps, you will 
create a PDF fi le of your CarAd_work.indd fi le so that other people can see your progress 
and provide feedback on changes that might need to be made before this project is sent to 
a printer for production.
PDFs can also be used for presentation purposes. PDFs generated in InDesign can contain 
sound, movies, animations, and hyperlinks to name a few.

3 
The Export Adobe PDF dialog box appears. From the Adobe PDF Preset drop-down 
menu at the top of the dialog box, you can choose settings that control the PDF fi le’s 
size and quality, among other options. Because you will send the car ad to several 
people for general review, choose the [Smallest File Size] option from the Adobe PDF 
Preset drop-down menu.
PDF presets are a way of saving favorite settings for the fi nal generated PDF fi le. If you own 
Adobe Acrobat 7.0 or a more recent version, InDesign CS6 shares these settings with Acrobat 
Distiller, which is included with Acrobat. Likewise, if you create a custom setting within 
Distiller, you’ll see those settings in the Adobe PDF Preset drop-down menu when you export a 
PDF fi le from within InDesign CS6.

Lesson 10, Prefl ighting, Printing and Creating PDFs from InDesign
Separation preview
Separation preview
Designed primarily to produce print layouts, InDesign supports both traditional methods 
of printing color: the four-color process (CMYK) model and spot colors as well as the 
RGB color model. In the four-color process model, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black 
inks (C, M, and Y, with black as the K) combine in various values to reproduce numerous 
colors. A printing press uses a separate plate for each of these four colors, laying the 
ink down on the substrate in separate layers. Spot colors are pre-mixed inks that match 
standard color values. To ensure the green in your company’s logo matches across all your 
print jobs, for example, you could choose a specifi c green spot color to ensure consistency. 
Probably the most widely used spot color system is the Pantone Matching System, which 
is also called PMS, or simply Pantone colors. As a companion to the system it developed, 
Pantone Inc. also off ers a swatch book so you can see how the colors reproduce on paper. 
All the Creative Suite applications have the Pantone library built in, so you can add spot 
colors to your document easily. Spot colors each require their own plates as well. 
All Pantone colors have CMYK equivalents that enable you to reproduce the color using 
the standard process colors as well, should you need to conform to CMYK-only printing 
requirements, or reduce the number of plates. 
Printing a Pantone color as a CMYK color may cause it to look diff erent from the spot version 
of that Pantone color. This is because of the limited gamut, or color range, that process colors are 
able to reproduce. Pantone off ers a Process Color Simulator guide that compares the printed spot 
color against the printed process color and is indispensable when you reproduce spot colors as four-
color process.
In the printing industry, printers charge customers for each plate that has to be produced 
for the printing job. You want to be sure that unnecessary colors are not mistakenly sent 
to the printer, as extra colors increase your cost and can cause confusion. To prevent this 
added expense and frustration, the InDesign Separations Preview panel lets you view the 
separate plates, or separations, as the printer would see them before you send your fi le. 
Take a tour of the panel as you check the car ad’s separations.

Choose Window > Output > Separations Preview, or press Shift+F6, to open the 
Separations Preview panel.

Click the visibility icon ( ) to the left of the CMYK entry to turn off  the visibility 
of the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black plates in your document. InDesign now 
displays only the elements in Pantone 187 C.
Use the separation Preview panel to see where certain colors are used in your document.
You can tell that Pantone 187 C is a spot color because it is still visible after all the 
other separations have been hidden. Another way to identify a spot color in your 
document is to look at your Swatches panel. If any color has this icon (
) to the right 
of the color name, it indicates that the color is a spot color and outputs on its own 
plate. Because the newspaper’s specifi cations forbid spot colors, you must replace them 
in the car ad. 
5 
Click on the panel menu button (
) in your Separations Preview panel or in the 
Swatches panel, and choose Ink Manager from the list. The Ink Manager lists all the 
plates or inks that are currently in your document.

In the Ink Manager, click the spot icon to the left of the Pantone 187 C plate to change 
it from a spot color to a process color. You now see a process color icon (
) to the left 
of the Pantone 187 C plate, indicating that the color will output as process instead 
of spot. Click OK. Because you mapped the Pantone 187 C plate to process and you 
turned off  display of your process colors in step 4, no colors are currently visible.
The Ink Manager allows you to control how colors will be output without having to manually 
modify the color in the document.
7 
Click on the visibility icon to the left of CMYK to see all the colors in your document 
again. The red color that was Pantone 187 C is now a red made of the four process 
colors. If you hover your cursor over diff erent areas of your document, you can see the 
ink percentages to the right of each color in the Separations Preview panel.
Hover your cursor over areas of your 
document to see the ink percentages.

Toggle the visibility of various separations in your Separations Preview panel to see 
how the colors in your document are combined to achieve other colors, called builds.

Printing a proof
The best way to avoid surprises at press time is to print a proof of your document on your 
desktop printer. Seeing your project on paper sometimes reveals design fl aws or mistakes 
you missed when viewing your document on screen. Printing out a version of your 
document on a printer is referred to as printing a proof. The term proof is used to describe 
any type of output that is generated prior to making plates for a printing press. In this 
exercise, you’ll use InDesign to print a proof to your desktop printer.
1 
With CarAd_work.indd open, choose File > Print to open the Print dialog box.
2 
From the Printer drop-down menu at the top of the Print dialog box, choose a printer 
that is available on your computer. 
3 
Because there is only one page in your CarAd_work.indd fi le, leave Pages set to All. For 
multi-page documents, however, you could specify a limited range of pages to print.
4 
Click Setup in the list on the left side of the Print window. On the right side, choose 
US Letter [8.5 × 11] from the Paper Size drop-down menu and click on the Landscape 
Orientation icon (
) to print your document in landscape orientation on standard 
letter-sized paper. The preview in the lower-left corner shows your page orientation 
and selected printer.
5 
Your ad is larger than the letter-sized paper you specifi ed in step 4, so click on the Scale 
to Fit radio button to scale your document to fi t the available space. This automatically 
fi ts and centers your document on the printed page. (If you have a large-format 
printer, of course, you can adjust the paper size as needed and print at full scale.)
The Print dialog box enables you to control all aspects of how your page is 
oriented to the paper and printer.

In the list on the left, click Marks and Bleed. Click the All Printer’s Marks checkbox to 
tell InDesign to add the appropriate trim, bleed, and color marks to your page as you 
would see on a printer’s proof. Leave the other settings at their defaults.
The Marks and Bleed section allows you to control the marks that are placed on 
your page when it is printed. 
7 
Click Output in the list on the left. If you are printing to a color printer that prints 
CMYK colors, choose Composite CMYK (or Composite RGB, if your printer 
doesn’t print CMYK colors) from the Color drop-down menu on the right. If you are 
printing to a black-and-white printer, choose Composite Gray instead.
8 
Click Graphics in the list on the left. In the Send Data drop-down menu of the Images 
section, choose the output quality of the graphics. Choose All for the best quality 
possible; choose Optimized Subsampling to let InDesign reduce the quality of your 
images slightly so the document prints faster. The higher the quality of the graphics, 
the more data InDesign needs to send to the printer and the longer it takes.
9 
Click Print.
10 Choose File > Save to save your fi le, and then choose File > Close to close it.
If you use the same print settings frequently, click the Save Preset button in the Print dialog box

Try the Find Font feature by choosing Type > Find Font to replace the fonts that 
Prefl ight or Package identifi es as missing, with fonts you have loaded on your computer. 
Likewise, use the Links panel by choosing Window > Links to fi x images that are missing 
or modifi ed in your document. To fi nd out more about what it means when fonts are 
missing, go to the Help fi le.
Investigate the numerous tools in InDesign CS6 that enable you to add interactivity to a PDF 
document when it is exported. For example, you can use the Button tool to add navigation 
to your exported PDF document, or you can add hyperlinks that are clickable links in the 
fi nal PDF fi le. InDesign CS6 off ers two PDF output methods, Print and Interactive. The 
interactive choice allows you to output a PDF fi le with interactive components like page 
transitions and animation. For more information on adding interactivity to an InDesign 
document, see Lesson 11, “Introduction to Digital Documents.” Practice modifying the 
PDF settings to achieve diff erent results in fi le size and other properties. When you create a 
confi guration that you like, save it as a PDF Preset so you can easily use it again in the future.
Using the Separation Preview panel’s Ink Manager, you can create an Ink Alias that maps one 
spot color to another. For instance, if you have two spot plates, you can map one ink to output 
on the same plate as the other ink. This feature is great when you realize at the last minute 
that you have too many spot colors in your document and need to minimize them. Practice 
this by creating a new document and adding at least two spot colors to your document. For 
more information on spot colors, check out Lesson 7, “Using Color in Your Documents.”

Lesson 11, Introduction to Digital Documents
Lesson 11
The term “Digital Document” can take on any number of diff erent 
meanings. As technology changes and evolves and publishing 
embraces diff erent mediums, you will create a variety of Digital 
Documents for diff erent purposes. InDesign has become the hub for 
creating these digital documents.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in the Starting up 
section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the id11lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have copied the idlessons folder onto your hard drive from the Digital Classroom 
DVD. See “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book. This lesson may 
be easier to follow if the id11lessons folder is on your desktop.

InDesign as your Digital Publication Hub
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom

In this lesson, you will create a multimedia brochure promoting a blueberry farm. You 
will add video, multi-state objects, and buttons that can be used when exported to various 
fi le formats.
See Lesson 11 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
InDesign relies on the free QuickTime Player to import video fi le formats. If you work on a Mac 
OS computer, you probably have QuickTime. If you work on a Windows computer, download 
QuickTime from www.apple.com/quicktime/download and install it on your PC.
InDesign as your Digital Publication Hub
Traditionally, InDesign has been the preferred tool for creating diff erent types of print 
publications, including catalogs, brochures, fl yers, newsletters, posters, etc. InDesign’s 
powerful graphic and typographic functions make it the tool of choice for design 
professionals. But as technology changes, so does InDesign.
Digital mediums have gained popularity in recent years because they add features such 
as audio, video, and other interactivity to the experience of reading content in such a 
way that can’t be done in the traditional print medium. Print still has its place and will 
continue to be used for years to come, but in the digital age, users want enhanced content 
that can be viewed on a computer or other devices such as smartphones and tablets. This 
is precisely why InDesign can export to such a variety of formats, including PDF, SWF, 
HTML, XML, .folio and many more.
With the demand for digital mediums that can be read on various devices, there needs to 
be a tool that can be used to create content for these devices. Adobe InDesign CS6 has 
some great new features to make the process of creating digital content easy and effi  cient, 
and because it’s a tool that so many users are already familiar with, they can jump right in 
using InDesign to create this digital content. These new features are not limited to digital 
content, however; many of the new features added to InDesign CS6 will be helpful for 
creating traditional print-based content as well.
Interactive design considerations
It’s not enough to export your document intended for print to a digital format and place 
it online. You must recognize that readers use online content diff erently, and that you’ll 
need to make your content fi t within their computer or device display so that it’s clearly 
readable. Some simple considerations with the type and layout can be very helpful. 
Sans-serif fonts, such as Myriad Pro, Arial, and Helvetica, are easier to read on-screen.

Lesson 11, Introduction to Digital Documents
Importing multimedia content
Additionally, you need to adjust the layout to fi t the medium. Print layouts are often 
designed to be tall and narrow in a portrait orientation, which does not translate well to a 
computer display. Online layouts work better in landscape (wide) orientation so that they 
can be viewed completely without scrolling. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to deal with 
some of these challenges using some new features found in InDesign CS6.
The fi nished online layout.
Importing multimedia content
You can use InDesign to import a variety of media types into your layout, including FLV, 
F4V, MP4, SWF, MOV, AVI, and MPEG for video and MP3 for audio. However, only 
fi les exported as interactive PDFs, .folio, and certain other formats will support MOV, 
AVI, and MPEG; an exported SWF fi le will not. It’s also important to remember that 
certain digital devices such as the iPhone® and iPad® do not currently support the Flash 
fi le format. InDesign does not support the common Windows Media fi le format (WMV), 
which is used with Windows Media Player and the Silverlight platform. You will start by 
importing a movie fi le into an existing frame.
1 
Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the id11lessons folder, select 
the id1101.indd fi le, and click Open. If necessary, update the links in this fi le.
2 
Make certain that page 1 is visible; if necessary, use the page drop-down menu in 
the lower-left corner of the document window to navigate to page 1. Choose the 
Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel and select the yellow frame in the lower-right 
corner.

Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, confi rm that Replace Selected Item is 
selected and Show Import Options is not selected. Navigate to the Links folder within 
the id11lessons folder and select the fi le 1102.mp4; then click Open. The video fi le is 
placed into the layout.
Placing a video fi le into InDesign is the same process as placing a graphic fi le; 
however, they do appear slightly diff erent. Notice that the video fi le has diagonal lines 
within the frame and there’s a media icon in the upper-left corner of the frame. The 
video fi le that was just placed is much bigger than the frame that it was placed into. In 
the next steps, you will resize the video to better fi t in the frame.
Media fi les contain diagonal lines within the frame and have a media icon located 
in the upper-left corner of the frame.

Adding a Hyperlink
What’s a digital document without hyperlinks? Hyperlinks provide a way to link content 
from a number of diff erent locations including to a page, an e-mail address, and a URL. To 
make it easy for a user to obtain more information about the Smith Blueberry Farm, you’ll 
add a hyperlink to a web page on page 1 to provide additional information to the user.

Choose File > Save to save your work.
Creating a Multi-State Object
A multi-state object is a great way to display multiple elements within a common area on 
an InDesign page. Using a multi-state object, you can create two or more object states that 
can display diff erent content within each state making it a great solution for items such as 
slideshows. Multi-state objects will appear in exported content such as .swf fi les, but they 
also can be used with Adobe’s new Digital Publishing Suite (DPS) software for producing 
content for digital tablet devices such as the Apple iPad®.
1 
Navigate to Page 2 in the id1101_work.indd fi le. Open the Layers panel by choosing 
Window > Layers.
2 
Note that there are three MSO layers that contain the content that will appear in each 
state of the multi-state object. Click the small square on the far right side of the MSO 
1 layer to select all the content on that layer. Note that the content on this layer has 
been grouped together to make the process of creating a multi-state object easier.
3 
Press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard and click the small square on the far 
right side of the MSO 2 and MSO 3 layer to select all the content on all three layers.

Open the Object States panel by choosing Window > Interactive > Object States. 
Click the Convert selection to multi-state object button ( ) to convert the selected 
content to a multi-state object. Each set of grouped items is converted to its own 
individual state within the multi-state object. The multi-state object is denoted by a 
heavy dashed line around the boundary of the item and an icon appears in the lower-
right corner indicating that it is a multi-state object.
5 
In the Object Name text fi eld at the top of the Object States panel, change the name 
to Slideshow.
6 
Click the diff erent states within the Object States panel to see the content change on 
the page as each state is selected. When you are fi nished, click back on State 1 to set it 
as the default state in the multi-state object, then close the Object States panel.
7 
Choose File > Save to save your work.
The diff erent states of a multi-state object
The default names for the states in the multi-state object are State 1, State 2, State 3, and 
so on. Although you can change the names of the states by clicking the name and typing 
a new name, we highly recommend you keep the names simple and not use any special 
or unique characters in the state names because this can cause the multi-state object to 
behave abnormally. In the next section, you will create buttons to provide a navigational 
mechanism to jump from one state to the next within the multi-state object.

corner of the Timing panel. This will open the SWF Preview panel and show you the 
animations in action!
10 Collapse the Preview and Animation panels and save the document. 
PDF Forms
If you’ve used any previous version of InDesign, you might have noticed that the Buttons and 
Forms panel has a new name. This is because InDesign CS6 adds the ability to author PDF-
based forms directly within InDesign.
Using the InDesign tools that you’re already familiar with, you can create visually interesting 
forms and then define InDesign frames as a check box, combo box, list box, radio button, 
signature field, or text field. In addition, frames can be converted to buttons with PDF 
actions that can print a form, clear a form, or submit a form.
For users who regularly need to create PDF-based forms, this is a huge improvement from 
having to add this functionality directly inside of Adobe Acrobat.

You will notice that some of the interactive features that have been added throughout this lesson, 
do not work in an interactive PDF fi le. Some of these features include the animations as well as 
the multi-state objects. This is a current limitation of exporting these elements to an Interactive 
PDF from InDesign. For more information on some of these limitations and for some tricks to 
overcome them, see the sidebar “Interactive PDF or Flash?”

Position the cursor in the upper-left corner of the second page. As the interactive page 
curl displays, click and drag to the right to navigate back to page 1.
9 
Close the browser window.
After exporting a document to the SWF fi le, you will have an HTML fi le, a SWF fi le, and 
possibly a Resources folder. The Resources folder will contain any external content that may be 
required to view the document, such as audio or video. It’s important that when uploading this 
content to a Web server that you include all the fi les, including the Resources folder, so that anyone 
viewing the web page will see it properly and in its entirety.

New layout features
Interactive PDF or Flash?
When working with multimedia content, Adobe InDesign CS6 contains two very powerful 
formats in which you can export interactive content: Flash and Interactive PDF. The tricky 
part about these formats is that not all the interactive features export to both formats. For 
example, animations that you create in InDesign will not directly export to an interactive 
PDF file even though Interactive PDF files support Flash.
Adobe InDesign CS6 contains several components specific to the Flash (.swf) file format 
that can be used to create animations and effects within InDesign. As of this writing, these 
animations are Flash-specific and will not directly export to the PDF format but will export 
to the .swf format.
For starters, multi-state objects like the one you created earlier in this lesson will function 
when exported to the .swf format. In addition, the Page Transitions panel provides one 
transition that will function only in the .swf format, which is the Page Curl effect.
When it comes to creating animations in InDesign CS6, you’ll notice two panels to help you 
do this: the Animation panel, and the Timing panel. Use the Animation panel to apply preset 
animation effects to objects in an InDesign layout and to customize the properties of those 
effects as well. Then, use the Timing panel to control the order of those animations when 
exported to the .swf format.
Interactive PDF files do support the use of buttons, movies, and placed .swf files. The fact 
that you can distribute these files to anyone who has the free Adobe Reader, makes the 
interactive PDF file format a great choice for reaching a broad audience.
A little-known trick when working with .swf files and interactive PDF files in InDesign, is 
that you can create the animations in InDesign, export to .swf and then reimport the .swf 
files into InDesign and the animation will work in an interactive PDF file. In addition, some 
features such as Go to Next View and Open file, work in an interactive PDF file but not in a 
.swf file. Understanding these nuances will save you time and frustration when working with 
these two formats.
New layout features
In this growing digital age, the need for designers to repurpose layouts at diff erent sizes and 
at diff erent specifi cations is becoming more and more common. For example, let’s say you 
create a layout for a project at 8.5˝ × 11˝ and now the customer needs a similar project for 
use in European countries at A4 size (8.3˝ × 11.7˝). Often times, however, the new size is 
more dramatic. For instance, maybe that 8.5˝ × 11˝ project now needs to become poster size 
at 17˝ × 22˝. With the advent of digital tablet devices, the need to create projects at multiple 
sizes has grown exponentially as each tablet has diff erent dimensions and each tablet has 
two orientations—portrait and landscape. Multiply those two orientations by the number 
of tablet devices on the market and you have a lot of layouts to create. Traditionally, 
your approach to this problem probably would be to duplicate the InDesign fi le and start 
reworking it for the new size resulting in several InDesign fi les and a lot of extra time.

11
New layout features
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
392
InDesign CS6 off ers several new features that makes repurposing layouts much easier. 
Regardless of whether you are designing for print or for digital, these new features are 
bound to make creating and repurposing projects easier for you, the designer.
Auto-Size Text Frames
New in InDesign CS6 is the ability to defi ne a text frame so that it automatically resizes 
based on the specifi cations that you defi ne. This can save you quite a bit of time by 
preventing you from resizing frames whenever text is overset. If you know in advance how 
you want a text frame to behave if it becomes overset, this feature can be a huge benefi t.
1 
Open the id1102.indd fi le from the id11lessons folder that you copied to your hard 
drive at the beginning of this lesson. If necessary, update the links in this fi le. This 
is an 8.5˝ × 11˝ fl yer that was created and we will be working with it throughout this 
exercise.
2 
With the Type tool active ( ), select the text “Feather Ridge” at the top of the 
page. We want to change the name of the ski slope for this fl yer, so type Endless 
Mountain to replace the text in this frame.
Notice that the text is overset because there is more text than will fi t within the 
frame. The obvious solution at this point is to make the frame larger to accommodate 
the text. But what if you could save some time and have this occur automatically? 
You’ll do exactly that in the next steps.
3 
Press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS) several times to return the text 
to its original appearance. Click the frame that contains the name of the ski slope with 
your Selection tool ( ), and choose Object > Text Frame Options. 
4 
Click the Auto-Size tab at the top of the dialog box to make it active. Currently the 
Auto-Sizing drop-down menu indicates that it is off .
5 
From the Auto-Sizing drop-down menu, choose Width Only. Then in the Auto-
Sizing proxy, choose the right-most option to cause the text frame to grow to the left 
when overset text exists. Click OK to close the dialog box.

11

Using the Type tool ( ), select the text “Feather Ridge” at the top of the page and type 
the words Endless Mountain. Notice that now, instead of the text becoming overset, 
the frame grows automatically to accommodate the text contained within the frame.
Setting the Auto-Sizing properties for the selected text frame.
7 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, change the name to id1102_work 
and click OK to save a working version of the fi le.
Flexible Width Text Frames
Often times when redesigning a page with diff erent specifi cations, you might want to 
add more columns to a text frame depending on how large the frame becomes. Again, 
InDesign CS6 adds a new feature that allows this to occur automatically based on the 
settings that you defi ne.
1 
With the id1102_work fi le still open, select the text frame in the middle of the page 
that begins with the text “A Seasonal Paradise.” Drag the right handle of the frame 
over to the right margin. Notice that the frame expands and the text refl ows to fi ll 
the frame. Although this may work for certain designs, we want the text to fl ow 
automatically into two separate columns.
2 
Press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS) to undo the resizing of the 
frame.
3 
With the frame still selected, choose Object > Text Frame Options to open the Text 
Frame Options dialog box. Make sure that the General button at the top of the dialog 
box is enabled.

11

4 
In the Columns drop-down menu, choose Flexible Width. You’ll notice that when you 
choose this option, the Maximum fi eld becomes editable. This fi eld allows you to defi ne 
the maximum width of the frame before an additional column is automatically added.
5 
Change the value in the Maximum fi eld to 2.5˝ and change the Gutter to .25˝. Click OK.
Choosing the Flexible Width option defi nes how big a frame can be before 
it will add columns to the text frame.
6 
Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the right handle of the text frame over to the right 
margin of the page. Notice this time that an additional column is added to the frame 
because of the specifi cations that we defi ned in step 5. Feel free to make the frame 
even larger to see the results, but then undo back to the 2 column appearance.

Layout adjustments
InDesign has contained the Layout Adjustment feature for many versions now and has helped 
many designers simplify the process of modifying layouts for diff erent purposes. InDesign 
CS6 takes this feature to a brand new level with its Liquid Layout feature. Liquid Layout 
off ers multiple options for controlling how a layout is resized when the page size changes.
Liquid Layout
1 
With the id1102_work fi le already open, choose Layout > Liquid Layout. Choosing 
this options does two things, it opens the Liquid Layout panel, and it activates the 
Page tool ( ).
There are four diff erent Liquid Page Rules to choose from: Scale, Re-Center, Object-
based, and Guide-based. After choosing Layout > Liquid Layout, the default Page 
Rule becomes Scale. In the next several steps, you will experiment with the diff erent 
Page Rules and then apply one of the Page Rules in the next section.
2 
Verify that the Page tool is active and that Scale is chosen from the Liquid Page Rule 
drop-down menu in the Liquid Layout panel. Drag any of the handles that appear 
in the corners and sides of the page to resize the page. Note that the objects scale to 
refl ect the new page size. Note that when you let go of the mouse, the page returns 
to its original size. This is by design to make the experimentation process easier when 
working with Liquid Layout. To make your adjustment “stick,” press and hold the Alt 
key (Windows) or Option key (Mac OS) before releasing the mouse button. If you do 
this however, press Undo to return to the original page dimensions.
Using the Page tool, drag the handles to resize the page.

3 
In the Liquid Layout panel, change the Liquid Page Rule to Re-center and drag the 
handles to see the behavior of this rule. Notice that all the content is recentered on the 
page based on the new size. Resizing the page to a smaller size isn’t much benefi t with 
this Liquid Page Rule, but could be helpful when resizing the page to a larger size. Let 
go of the mouse to return to the original page size.
4 
In the Liquid Layout panel, change the Liquid Page Rule to Object-based. Drag one 
of the handles to resize the page. You need to perform an additional step to make this 
method work. Release the mouse button.
5 
With the Object-based page rule, you need to defi ne the objects that you want to 
scale and maintain position. With the Page tool still active, click the photo of the 
snowboarder in the lower-right corner of the page. In the Liquid Layout panel, click 
the Auto-fi t check box to make the photo auto-fi t within the frame, then enable the 
Height and Width check boxes to allow the frame to scale in both directions. Finally, 
enable the Bottom and Right check boxes to pin the bottom-right of the frame to its 
current location.
6 
Drag the handles to resize the page. Note that the photo of the snowboarder grows as 
you resize the page and its location is pinned to the bottom right of the page. Release 
the mouse button to return the page to its original size.
Defi ning properties for the Object-based page rule (left) and the visual indicators that appear on 
the selected object (right).

7 
In the Liquid Layout panel, change the Liquid Page Rule to Guide-based. The Guide-
based Page Rule requires that you drag out a guide to defi ne objects that should resize 
with the page.
8 
Click the ruler on the left side of your screen and drag out a guide so that it is positioned 
in such a way that it intersects through the photo on the bottom-left of the page, the 
main text frame on the page, and the “Endless Mountain” text frame. Any object that 
the guide pierces will expand when the page is resized in a horizontal direction. Vertical 
guides control horizontal resizing and horizontal guides control vertical resizing.
9 
Click and drag the page handles with the Page tool active to resize the page. Notice 
that the objects that are pierced with the guide resize but the other items do not. 
Release the mouse button to return the page to its original size.
10 Choose File > Save to save the fi le.
You will have to experiment with your own project to determine which Liquid Page 
Rule will best suit your needs. Now that you understand how these page rules work, 
proceed to the next section where you will apply a Liquid Page Rule in conjunction 
with another new InDesign CS6 feature.
Alternate Layouts
When creating projects that require more than one version of a layout, it can be 
cumbersome and time-consuming to make sure that changes to one layout get updated in 
all the other layouts. This leaves a lot of room for human error that can be costly in several 
ways. InDesign CS6 introduces a new feature called Alternate layout that allows you to 
create multiple versions of a layout and makes it easy to maintain changes from one layout 
to another. In this exercise, you will create a poster size version of the fl yer that you’ve 
been working with.
1 
Make sure that the id1102_work fi le is open in InDesign and make the Selection tool 
( ) active.

Linked Content
There’s more than meets the eye when creating Alternate Layouts. When the Alternate 
Layout was created, the Link Stories option was chosen. This caused the alternate layout to 
create links to the text in the original layout. The graphics also are linked to the original 
layout. This makes the process of updating content across multiple layouts very effi  cient.
1 
In the id1102_work document, double-click page 1 of the Letter V layout in the Pages 
panel to make that the active page.
2 
Click the Split Layout View button (
) in the lower-right corner of the document

4 
Click in the view to the right to make it active. In the Pages panel, double-click 
page 1 of the Poster V layout, then press Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 (Mac

Click back in the view to the left (the Letter V layout), and using the Type tool 
( ) change the text “A Seasonal Paradise” to A Winter Wonderland. You will 
immediately notice that the text in the Poster V layout has a modifi ed link icon in the 
upper-left corner of the frame to indicate that the text is out of date. This is because 
the Poster V layout is linked to the Letter V layout.
When text is modifi ed in the parent layout, the child layout indicates that the link to the text has been modifi ed. 
6 
To update the text in the Poster V layout, select the Selection tool ( ) and click once 
on the modifi ed link icon (

Alternate Layouts and Tablet Publishing 
Alternate layouts are also useful when using InDesign to create layouts to be viewed on a 
tablet device such as an iPad.
Tablets include two orientations—horizontal and vertical. You can use alternate layouts to 
design how a page will look in either orientation, and use the liquid layout feature to reduce 
the amount of time required to create each orientation.
These are only useful if distributing publications using Adobe’s Digital Publishing Suite, 
which is not an ideal solution for most publishers because it has a high cost per publication 
distributed, and also has additional fees charged to the publisher for every copy downloaded. 
Some competitive offerings are starting to emerge at lower prices, such as the Digital 
Publishing System from Aquafadas (www.aquafadas.com). Whether using Adobe, Aquafadas, or 
another vendor, you can create content using InDesign and distribute it onto various tablets 
using their services, for a fee.

Lesson 11, Introduction to Digital Documents

Alternate Layouts for Tablet Devices
Let’s say you started with an InDesign document that was built for the portrait orientation of 
a tablet device. Now you wanted to create a landscape version for that device, you could do 
the following:
1 
Go to the panel menu of the Pages panel, and choose Create Alternate Layout.
2 
Change the orientation to landscape but keep the same size. You could also at this point 
choose a liquid page rule to let InDesign attempt to reorganize the page elements to fi t 
the new layout. Click Ok.
Clockwise from upper-left: The Portrait layout, the landscape layout, and the Pages panel showing the Alternate 
Layouts that made them. 
You now will have an alternate layout of your document. Even if Alternate layout required 
some minor adjustments to the positioning of objects on the layout, you’d still be much 
further along than you would have been by staring over with a new document.
The other benefit to using Alternate Layout, is that the content is linked together. Both text 
and images will update in all Alternate Layouts when a modification to one of them is made 
providing for even more time savings in the long run.

The Content tools
As you’ve seen in the previous section, when you create an Alternate Layout, you can link 
the graphics and stories so that when an item is modifi ed in one layout, it can easily be 
updated in another layout. But what if you need to add content after the Alternate Layout 
has been created? Adobe InDesign CS6 includes some new tools to assist you in this 
situation. The Content Collector tool, Content Placer tool, and Content Conveyor allow 
you to pickup content from one layout and easily place it in another. In this exercise, you 
will learn how to use these tools.
1 
With the id1102_work.indd fi le still open on your computer, go to the Pages panel, 
and double-click page 1 of the Letter V layout to make it active. Press Ctrl+0 
(Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS) to fi t the page to the window.
2 
Choose File > Place and choose the SSI.ai fi le located in the Links folder of the 
id11lessons folder. Click Open.
3 
With the loaded graphics icon, click and drag in the lower-left corner of the page to 
place the graphic within the width of the photo already on the page.
Click and drag to place the graphic in the lower-left corner of the page on the 
Letter V layout.
4 
In the Pages panel, double-click page 1 of the Poster V layout to make that page 
active. Press Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS) to fi t the page to the

Select the Content Collector tool ( ) from the Tools panel and click the graphic in the 
lower-left corner of page 1 of the Letter V layout. Notice that the graphic now appears 
in the Content Conveyor at the bottom of the screen. Using this tool, you can click as 
many elements as you wish (graphic or text elements) and collect them for reuse in the 
Content Conveyor.
The graphic from the page picked up with the Content Collector tool and loaded 
into the Content Conveyor.
7 
Double-click page 1 of the Poster V layout to make the page active. Press Ctrl+0 
(Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS) to fi t the page to the document window.
8 
Switch to the Content Placer tool ( ) by selecting it at the bottom of the Content 
Conveyor, or by clicking and holding the Content Collector tool and choosing it from 
the drop-down menu.
9 
Click the Create Link check box at the bottom of the Content Conveyor panel, then 
click to place the graphic in the lower-left corner of page 1 of the Poster V layout. Switch 
to the Selection tool and resize the graphic appropriately for the larger Poster V layout.
10 Because we created a link between these two layouts for this graphic, when you 
update the parent element (the one on the Letter V layout), the child element (the one 
on the Poster V layout) will update. Unfortunately, this includes the sizing as well. 
Fortunately, we can control that. With the graphic selected on the Poster V layout, go 
to the Links panel and choose Link Options from the panel menu.

Creating PDF Forms
InDesign CS6 has added the ability to export to a PDF fi le with fi llable form fi elds that 
were created in InDesign. This saves a large amount of time as the form fi elds don’t need 
to be created directly in Adobe Acrobat as they have in the past. There are several diff erent 
types of form fi elds that InDesign allows you to defi ne including Check Box, Combo Box, 
List Box, Radio Buttons, Signature Fields, and Text Fields. In this lesson, you’ll use a few 
of these fi eld types to make a fi llable PDF form.
1 
In InDesign, choose File > Open and navigate to the id11lessons folder and select the 
fi le id1103.indd and open the fi le.
2 
Choose Window > Layers to open the Layers panel. Then click on the Form Field 
Layer to make it the active layer. Note that there is Form Appearance layer that is 
locked and contains static information about the form and a Form Fields layer where 
you’ll be creating form fi elds that users can type in to enter data. The document has 
been setup this way for convenience and although isn’t necessary, it can be helpful 
when creating a PDF form with multiple fi elds.

Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the Address, City, Zip, Phone, and E-mail fi elds. Although 
you may be tempted to defi ne the Zip and Phone fi elds as a number, this is not 
possible directly in InDesign. In addition, Zip and Phone fi elds can’t be defi ned as 
number fi elds because they often require “-” as the contents which are not considered 
numerals. If desired, you could modify these fi elds directly in Acrobat to contain the 
correct data.
9 
Choose File > Save As and name the fi le id1103_work.indd. Click OK.
Adding a Combo Box
A Combo Box provides a drop-down menu with predefi ned options for a user to choose 
from. This is especially useful to the form designer as it provides control of the choices that 
the user has to choose from and can prevent the entry of invalid data.

Lesson 12, Creating Digital Books
Lesson 12
This lesson covers the capabilities for creating digital books by 
generating ePub digital book fi les using InDesign CS6.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. You’ll use InDesign’s Advanced workspace for this lesson. Choose Window > 
Workspace > Advanced and then choose Window > Workspace > Reset Advanced. For 
more details on this process, see “Resetting the InDesign workspace and preferences” in 
the Starting Up section of this book. 
You will work with several fi les from the id12lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have copied the id12lessons folder onto your hard drive from the Digital Classroom 
DVD or downloaded from the location specifi ed in your ebook if you are reading a digital 
version of this book. See “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting Up section of this book for 
details. This lesson may be easier to follow if the id12lessons folder is on your desktop.
Creating Digital Books
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Preparing documents for 
conversion to ePub
• Style Mapping
• Setting export order
• Object export options
• Adding CSS formatting
• Generating ePub digital 
book fi les

See Lesson 12 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features 
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
The project
In this lesson you will create a digital book fi le using InDesign to generate an ePub 
document. ePub is the digital book format used to freely distribute digital book fi les across 
all major electronic devices such as the nook or iPad and serves as the foundation for the 
format used on Kindle devices. For this lesson you will work with a document that is 
being created for both print and digital versions. You will take the completed version that 
was prepared for printing and modify it for use on digital devices.
You will discover how to control settings which aff ect the export process, and how 
organizing a book for reading on a digital device may require diff erent organization and 
structure to the InDesign document.
About the ePub format
ePub is the format used for most electronic books today. It is maintained by an international 
standards group, the IDPF. The official specifications for the ePub format are found online 
at: www.idpf.org.
An ePub file is a group of files that have been bundled together into a compressed file folder 
that is given the ePub name. The contents of an ePub need to be arranged in a specific 
way so that digital readers like the nook, iPad, Sony Reader and others can understand and 
display the contents. The Kindle digital reading devices use their own file format which is 
a modified version of the ePub file format, making ePub the starting digital file format for 
distribution on most every digital reading device.
If you were to crack-open an ePub file, inside you would find HTML files along with a 
CSS file describing how to format the book. The HTML files may also reference images, 
multimedia, and in some cases fonts, all which could also be included within the ePub file.
You can make ePub files using Adobe InDesign and share them with readers, or sell them 
online. When selling them online, some stores may add Digital Rights Management to 
protect against unauthorized copying and distribution, but this is something that occurs with 
the book reseller or distributor, and is not part of Adobe InDesign.

Lesson 12, Creating Digital Books
Preparing your InDesign document for ePub conversion
Preparing your InDesign document for ePub conversion
InDesign documents require some adjustments prior to exporting them to ePub. If you 
don’t prepare the fi le before exporting, the fi les may not display as intended, with images 
or text appearing in the incorrect sequence, or some items not appearing at all.
Using styles
Using paragraph, character, and object styles helps keep your documents looking consistent 
when converting to a digital format such as ePub. All text should be styled, and styles 
should apply consistently. Styles become even more important when converting to a digital 
format, as each set of text formatting must use a style name, and if you haven’t assigned 
a style name, InDesign must create a style to identify the text and formatting. If you’ve 
already styled the text, InDesign uses your existing style name and attributes—which is 
both faster and more effi  cient.
Styles in the Paragraph styles panel should not contain any overrides. Overrides are 
manual adjustments or changes that you may have applied to individual pieces of text 
after applying a style. Instead you should always use Character styles when formatting 
individual characters within a paragraph. These individual character styles can then be 
translated into the digital version of your document. If you manually adjust the formatting 
of individual characters and words, without creating or using a Character style, these 
formatting changes may not convert to the digital document.
1 
Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the id12lessons folder, select 
the fi le id1201.indd, and then click Open. If a dialog box appears asking if you want to 
update modifi ed links, press Update Links. The document should open to the fi rst page. 
If necessary, double-click the page 1 icon in the Pages panel to navigate to this page.
2 
Choose the Text tool ( ) from the Tools panel, then click to place the cursor in the 
word By in the line By The Brothers Grimm.
3 
Click the Paragraph Styles button along the right side of the document window or 
choose Type > Paragraph Styles. Note the plus sign (+) which appears next to the 
paragraph style name. This indicates that the text was changed after the style was 
applied to it. InDesign refers to this as a style override. 
You should remove style overrides before converting to an ePub. You can do this 
by creating a character style that accounts for the formatting changes. By creating a 
character style, InDesign can easily convert these attributes into a digital document.
4 
Click the Character Styles button along the right side of the document window or 
choose Type > Character Styles.
5 
Double-click to select the word By in the line By The Brothers Grimm, then click the 
Italic Character Style to apply the Character Style to this word.
6 
Switch to the Paragraph Style panel for a moment and notice the plus sign is no longer 
displayed, as the character style and paragraph style work together to describe all the 
text in this line.
7 
Repeat this process on page 3, applying the Italic character style to the word By.

Export style tagging: Defining how InDesign styles convert to 
ePub styles 
If you intend to use specific style names in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) for your ePub, 
you can specify how InDesign character styles and paragraph styles are identified when you 
create an ePub. You can specify how individual styles are converted to CSS styles as part of 
their InDesign style definition, or you can specify how all styles are converted.
To specify how an individual style is converted to a CSS style, start by selecting a style in 
either the character or paragraph style panel menu, then use the panel menu to choose the 
Style Options command. In the Style Options dialog box, use the Export Tagging option to 
specify the CSS style to apply when creating the ePub by choosing the CSS style (tag) to be 
used from the Tag option.
Specify how individual InDesign styles convert to CSS styles in an ePub using the 
Tag drop-down menu in the Export Tagging section of the Style Options dialog box.
To specify how all InDesign styles convert to CSS styles used in an ePub, choose Edit all 
Export tags from either the Paragraph styles or Character styles panel. 
In the Edit all Export Tags dialog box, you can specify the CSS styles to use 
for all the document styles in a single location.

Controlling Object Export Settings
To control the positioning or spacing of objects on a page that will be converted to ePub, 
you may use the Object Export Options. This is especially useful if you have one item that 
should be positioned or controlled diff erently from all other elements. For example, if you 
have one image that is to be positioned in the center of the layout, while all other images 
are to be fl ush along the left side of the layout. You can use the Object Export Options to 
adjust the one item that varies from all the others.

Click Done.
Adding interactive links
Digital books can include hyperlinks to enhance the reading experience. You can use 
InDesign to add hyperlinks to diff erent parts of the same document, or to web addresses 
on the Internet. Some of this linking can be done automatically for you, such as creating a 
table of contents with hyperlinks, while others you can add or modify on your own. You’ll 
start by adding a hyperlink to a website, and then create an interactive table of contents 
that links to the start of each fairy tale in the book. 
Adding hyperlinks
Adding hyperlinks involves selecting text and indicating to InDesign where the text 
should link to when it is clicked after the document is exported to an ePub fi le. The 
hyperlinks are not active within the InDesign fi le itself.
1 
Navigate to page 3 of the document, containing the book title and byline.
2 
Open the Hyperlinks panel by choosing Window > Interactive > Hyperlinks.
3 
On page 3, use the Type tool to select the words Digital Classroom.
4 
In the Hyperlinks panel, at the top of the panel in the URL section, place the cursor 
after the http:// and enter www.DigitalClassroom.com then press the Enter or 
Return key on your keyboard. The hyperlink is added to the document.

Lesson 12, Creating Digital Books
Adding interactive links
Creating an interactive Table of Contents
A table of contents is important for readers to navigate to a section of a book. You do not 
want to manually create links to each of the chapters in a book, or in this case, each of the 
individual stories. Here you will have InDesign create the table of contents for you, and 
add hyperlinks to the location of the stories. 
The table of contents can also appear in the built-in navigational controls available within 
e-reading devices and software. To enable this, you will create a table of contents style. 
Later, when exporting to ePub, you will have InDesign use this style to automatically 
generate an interactive contents fi le for digital readers along with the table of contents that 
appears at the start of the book.
1 
Navigate to page 2 of the document. A blank page is displayed. You will add the table 
of contents to this page.
2 
Choose Layout > Table of Contents Styles, then click New to create a new style. 
A style is necessary for creating a table of contents that appears within the built-in

In the TOC Style text box, enter the name ePub TOC, confi rm the Title is Contents 
and from the Style drop-down menu, choose contents-headline to apply this style to the 
word Contents when it appears at the top of the automatically generated table of contents.
4 
In the Styles in Table of Contents section, locate the Other Styles list and scroll to the 
chapter-headline style. Click this style, then click the << Add button to add this to the 
list of styles included in the table of contents.

Continuing to work in the New Table of Contents Style window, confi rm the 
chapter-headline style is selected in the Include Paragraph Styles list, then make the 
following adjustments:
• For Entry Style choose contents-entry. This is a style that was created for you to use 
in this document.
• For Page Number choose No Page Number as the digital version of the book will 
not have specifi c page numbers, and the hyperlink will take the reader to the start of 
the selected story, regardless of its location.
• For Level confi rm that 1 is selected, indicating that each story will be the top-most 
item in the table of contents.
If you do not see the Page Number or Level options, click the More Options button in the upper 
left side of the New Table of Contents Style dialog box.

Choose Layout > Table of Contents. From the TOC Style drop-down menu, choose 
the ePub TOC style you created in the previous steps, then click OK. The cursor 
becomes loaded, ready to place text into the layout.
8 
Click the loaded cursor near the upper-left corner of the page, where the two 
margin guides intersect. The table of contents is placed into the page. While the text 
may appear to be normal text, InDesign will add hyperlinks for you at the time to 
document is exported. The TOC style you created will also be used in the next part 
of this lesson to automatically create the interactive table of contents at the time you 
generate the ePub fi le.

Creating an ePub
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
424
Creating an ePub
As you prepare to export your book to the ePub format, you will want to identify which 
items should be part of the digital version of the book, and the sequence in which they 
will export. 
Specifying Object Export Order
The page layout for your InDesign document doesn’t always translate perfectly to digital 
books. If you were to convert this book directly to ePub, you would fi nd that images may 
appear in wildly diff erent locations in the book, or that certain content may not appear 
at all in the ePub. For example, master page items are not included in digital book fi les 
created from InDesign, and images and non-linked text frames may not appear in the 
order in which they need to fl ow within the book.
On its own, InDesign doesn’t do an eff ective job of determining how text and graphics 
should be positioned on a digital page when fi les are converted to ePub. Fortunately you 
can provide some guidance to help create digital fi les that more closely match your desired 
layout. With some guidance from you, InDesign can produce a more logically structured 
digital book fi le. One way to help with this is to use the Articles panel to organize content 
into the sequence in which it should appear in a digital book.
1 
Choose Window > Articles. The Articles panel opens. You will use the Articles panel 
to specify which items in the document will be converted to the digital version of 
the document in the ePub format, and the order in which they appear in the digital 
layout. Items that are not contained in the Articles panel will not be exported.
2 
Continuing to work on the second page of the document, use the Selection tool to 
click and drag the entire text frame containing the Table of Contents into the articles 
panel. The New Article window appears. Enter the name Contents and confi rm 
Include when Exporting is checked, and then click OK.
Adding an item to the Articles panel to specify its export 
order when creating an ePub.
You started adding items on the second page and not the fi rst because in this publication the fi rst 
page will be used as the cover, and you will specify this at the time you generate your ePub fi le. 
If the cover was created separately, you would start adding items to the Articles panel at the fi rst 
page of the InDesign document.

12
425
Lesson 12, Creating Digital Books
Creating an ePub
3 
Navigate to page 3. Using the Selection tool, click and drag the text box containing 
the book title into the articles panel. The New Article window appears. Enter the 
name Body Text for the Article Name and confi rm the checkbox is selected for 
Include when Exporting, and then click OK.
You can also use the Articles panel to arrange the digital version of a book in a 
diff erent sequence than the book layout within InDesign. For example, you may have 
a copyright page at the start of a book layout you created for a print version, but prefer 
to place this at the end of the layout for the digital version. Using the Articles panel 
you can reorganize the content for the digital version, placing the copyright page, or 
any other content, in a diff erent sequence within the layout.
The Articles panel after adding the Body Text article.
4 
Navigate to page four and continuing to use the Selection tool, click on the text frame 
containing the headline for the story The Golden Bird. If text threads are not already 
visible, choose View > Extras > Show Text Threads. Because this text frame is linked 
to the text frame added to the articles panel, it will be included in the ePub export. 
When a text frame is placed in the Articles panel, the content of all linked text frames 
is exported to ePub.
Using anchored objects to control object placement
On page 4 of the document, notice the picture of the golden bird. Unless you add this 
image to the articles panel, it will not be included in the ePub you are creating. You 
can add the image to the articles panel, but the only options are for adding it before or 
after each article or between each story. This image needs to appear in the middle of the 
article—not at the start or end. For images to export with text in the middle of an article, 
they need to be attached, or anchored, to the text. Here you will anchor the image to the 
related story so that it exports in the correct location.
1 
Using the selection tool, click to select the image of the golden bird. Notice the solid 
blue square along the top edge of the frame, near the top-right corner. You will use 
this to anchor the image to the story.

3 
Save your document by choosing File > Save.
You can also use anchored objects for separate text frames that relate to text surrounding them but 
are not part of a text fl ow, such as a sidebar or pull-quote.
Specifying the cover
You can create a separate cover image using a program like Photoshop, and add the cover 
at the time you are exporting, or you can use the fi rst page of the InDesign fi le as the 
cover. For this example you will use the fi rst page as the cover.
1 
Navigate to the fi rst page of the document.
2 
Using the Selection tool, click to select the image of the fairy. Shift+click to also select 
the text under the image containing the title of the book.
3 
With both the text and image selected, choose Object > Group to have these items 
treated as one element by InDesign.

In the Articles panel, click and drag the Cover article to the top of the list of articles. 
When exporting, you will specify to InDesign that this group of items on the fi rst 
page will be used as the cover image for the book.
ePub export settings
You are now ready to export your document to the ePub fi le format.
1 
Choose File > Export. The Export dialog box opens. Choose EPUB from the Save 
as type (Windows) or Format (Mac) menu at the bottom of the dialog box, confi rm 
you are saving the fi le in a location you can easily access such as the Desktop, then 
click Save. The EPUB Export Options dialog box appears. The dialog box has three 
separate sections you can select along the left side: General, Image, and Advanced. You 
will work through these three sections to specify how your ePub fi le will be created.
2 
In the General section, for Version: choose EPUB 3.0. 
New devices sold since 2011 support this standard and most older devices have had 
software updates to allow ePub fi les created using this standard to display. While 3.0 
supports having audio and video fi les embedded into the digital book, older devices 
typically ignore these elements if they were created as purely reading devices. Many of 
the more modern reading devices are multipurpose, and can be used for reading and 
also support multimedia content. Keep the EPUB Export Options dialog box open.

12

3 
In the Setup section, for Cover choose Rasterize First Page.
This causes the fi rst page of the document to be turned into an image, which will be 
used to represent the cover of the book. The cover of the book is displayed when the 
book is placed into most digital reader’s libraries.
4 
For TOC Style, choose ePub TOC. This is the Table of Contents style you created 
earlier in this lesson. It calls for all text using the chapter-headline style to be added to 
the interactive table of contents, with links to the location where each story starts.
5 
For margins, enter 10 pixels for all four sides. The margins are placed around the edge 
of the book, allowing space between the text and the side of the reader. Note that 
many reading devices use their own margins and will ignore this value, but it’s worth 
entering it here for those readers using software or a device that would otherwise place 
the text right against the edges of the container displaying the book.
6 
From the Content Order drop-down menu select Same as Articles Panel. This causes 
InDesign to use the order you specifi ed in the Articles panel to determine the ePub 
export order.
While it is possible to convert an InDesign book to ePub without using the articles panel, by 
choosing the Based on Page Layout option, the results are typically quite poor. Unless you have a 
document containing no images and one long text fl ow, the Based on Page Layout option is not 
advisable.
7 
Under the Text Options settings:
• Leave the Place Footnote After Paragraph option unchecked. This is useful if your 
document contains footnotes, so they are located closer to their location in the 
document. This document contains no footnotes.
• Check to select the Remove Forced Line Breaks option. This causes InDesign to 
remove any extra line breaks that may have been added for a print layout. When 
converting to a digital format, these line breaks disrupt the reading experience, as 
each user may have a diff erent screen width and resolution, and all line breaks are 
diff erent. This is unlike a printed version where all readers see the same document 
with the same line breaks.

Click the Image tab along the left side of the dialog box and review these settings:
• Select the Preserve Appearance option from Layout to make certain images are 
cropped just as they are within the layout. If this is deselected, full-size images are 
used within the layout.
• Set Resolution (ppi) to 150 for images to retain enough resolution if they are 
zoomed-in or viewed on modern devices with higher resolution displays.
• Select Fixed from the Image Size drop-down menu to keep images the same size, 
regardless of the size of the display. If you prefer to allow images to adapt to the

• For Image Alignment and Spacing, click the Align Left button and set the space of 
6 pixels before and after all images.
• Do not select the option to Insert Page Break before or after the image. You may 
fi nd this option useful with books that use an image to separate each chapter, but 
the images in this book do not need to sit on their own page.
• Select Settings Apply to Anchored Objects to apply these image settings to any 
anchored images such as the picture of the Golden Bird.

• For image conversion, choose JPEG because all images in this book use a variety of 
colors and shades which lend themselves well to the JPEG format. For other books, 
you may wish to select Automatic when there are a variety of image types, such as 
pictures and illustrations.
• For JPEG Options, choose High for the Image Quality and select Baseline for 
Format Method. These options control how the images will appear after converted 
to the JPEG format for use in the ePub.
• Do not select the Ignore Object Export Settings. This option is used if you need 
to override the Object Export Settings that have been set for specifi c images. It is 
preferable to keep this deselected and set the export options for individual images 
as needed, and then control all others here. Most of the controls available in this 
section can be accessed for each individual image, or for grouped objects, by 
choosing Object > Object Export Settings

Click the Advanced tab along the left side of the dialog box.
• From the Split Document drop-down menu, select Do Not Split. This option could 
be used to break the document into sections at each of the chapter titles.
• For EPUB Metadata enter your name as the publisher and keep the Unique ID 
produced by InDesign. For books, the ISBN is typically placed in this Unique ID 
fi eld.
• For CSS Options:
 – Select the Include Style Defi nitions option for InDesign to defi ne the style of text 
formatting when the ePub is generated.
 – Deselect the Preserve Local Overrides option so that only text with styles applied 
is formatted in the ePub.
 – Deselect the option to Include Embeddable Fonts because many ereaders cannot 
use fonts embedded by InDesign, and books with fonts embedded fail validation 
tests and cannot be sold on most digital books stores.
The Advanced ePub settings control whether metadata is included in the fi le and whether InDesign 
creates a cascading style sheet (CSS) to apply formatting and styling to the contents of the ePub. 
If a CSS fi le is not generated, or if styles are not defi ned by InDesign, the ePub must be edited 
later using a text editor to add the CSS rules.
10 Click OK to generate the ePub from your InDesign document. Depending upon the 
speed of your computer, this may take a minute or two for it to complete. Longer 
documents may take several minutes to complete.

Testing your ePub
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
432
Testing your ePub
After generating your ePub, you can view it to confi rm that all the contents exported and 
are displaying as you expected them to appear. 
ePub viewers
There are many ePub viewers using diff erent viewing “engines” to display ePub fi les: 
Adobe Reader Mobile SDK (RMSDK) and WebKit. Along with reading devices that 
support the ePub format, there are also the Kindle devices which use their own fi le 
format. It’s quite possible that your ePub fi les will look diff erent across many devices. For 
this reason, it is useful to understand ways to test your ePub fi les to confi rm they will look 
acceptable on the majority of devices. You’ll start by gaining an understanding of the two 
primary ePub reading engines that power most ePub readers:
Adobe Reader Mobile SDK (RMSDK) is licensed by Adobe to device makers for displaying 
digital books. It provides Adobe Digital Rights Management (DRM) for ePub fi les to limit 
them from being copied without permission. On computer desktops, Adobe Digital Editions 
behaves similarly to RMSDK, making Adobe Digital Editions a good option for testing to 
see how a book will display within RMSDK devices. You’ll fi nd RMSDK used in Adobe 
Digital Editions, the Sony Reader, and the nook among other devices.
To test your book using the Adobe Reader, go to adobe.com and download Adobe Digital 
Editions. After downloading Adobe Digital Editions, open the ePub fi le you created 
using the Adobe Digital Editions software. Confi rm the cover displays as expected, and 
the hyperlinks along the side of the document function properly. These hyperlinks were 
created using the TOC style you included when generating the ePub.

Lesson 12, Creating Digital Books
Testing your ePub
WebKit is the other major ePub viewing engine. It powers many readers including Chrome, 
Safari, iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch, and Android. WebKit is also a popular mobile web 
browser, and is used on many smartphones sold today. Readers that use WebKit include the 
desktop version of the nook reader, Apple’s iBooks, Bookworm, and Ibis reader. 
If you are using the Firefox web browser, you can fi nd an ePub viewer 
for testing ePubs right within your Mac or Windows computer here: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/fi refox/addon/epubreader/.

ePub validation
Formal ePub validation is required if you plan to sell your ePub file through various online 
stores. This confirms the ePub file meets that standards for ePub files. 
There are two options for validating an epub:
• Online validation is an option using the International Digital Publishing Forum validator 
available at http://validator.idpf.org/. This supports files that are 10 MB or smaller.
• Download and install the epubcheck validation tool on your own computer. It is available 
at http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/
Not all files generated from InDesign are valid, as InDesign includes options to add items 
to an ePub that are not supported, and earlier versions of InDesign failed to include other 
required items. It is often necessary to extract and edit the contents of an ePub file to 
manipulate its contents in order to make it fully valid. This process is beyond the scope of 
this lesson, as it can involve code editing and requires some knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Kindle conversion
While Kindle devices use their own file format, most Kindle books start as ePub files. 
You can then convert your books to the Kindle format. The easiest way to convert 
ePub files to the Kindle format is to use the Kindle Previewer. Opening an ePub 
using the Kindle Previewer automatically converts it to the Kindle format. The exact 
web address to download the previewer is quite long, and it’s easier to simply use a 
search engine such as Bing or Google to search for Kindle Previewer. The correct 
link is located on the Amazon.com site. The full link for downloading the previewer is 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765261.
Distributing ePub files
Once you create an ePub, you can distribute the fi le through a traditional publisher or on 
your own by establishing accounts with the largest ePub resellers such as Apple, Barnes & 
Noble, Amazon. These services will add Digital Rights Management to your fi les if you 
request, making it so that the fi les are less likely to be copied illegally.
To self-publish on Amazon, visit Kindle Direct Publishing at http://kdp.amazon.com/. For 
self-publishing on Barnes & Noble visit http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com. To publish via 
iTunes, establish an account with Apple here http://itunes.com/sellyourbooks. In all cases you 
will want to validate your ePub before distribution.
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson.

Questions
1 
Is the ePub fi le format used by all digital book reading devices?
2 
What is the purpose of the Articles panel?
3 
What can be controlled using Object Export Settings?
4 
Does InDesign automatically generate a table of contents for all ePub fi les?
Answers
1 
No, the ePub format is an industry standard used by many major book readers such as 
the iPad and nook, but not the Kindle. The Kindle uses a format that starts with ePub 
fi les, but converts them to its own format.
2 
The Articles panel controls the sequence in which items are exported into an ePub 
document.
3 
You can use Object Export Setting to specify how individual images will export and 
whether grouped content, including text and images, should be converted to a single 
item and turned into an image (rasterized).
4 
No, InDesign only generates a table of contents if you have fi rst created a table of 
contents style, and then specifi ed the use of that style in the ePub export dialog box.

About the new features in InDesign CS6 
Adobe InDesign CS6 is the eighth version of InDesign, and the software has been 
available for more than a decade. InDesign has a well-established way of performing most 
basic tasks, and the fundamentals of working with the software have not changed much 
over the recent versions. If you were to be placed in front of a computer using InDesign 
CS4, CS5, or CS6, you would likely feel right at home for creating most basic documents. 
The recent updates to InDesign have focused on minor improvements to the software to 
improve effi  ciency and more recently on digital publishing. We’ve updated every chapter 
in the InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom to refl ect changes in the InDesign CS6 software. 
Most of the new features are targeted at more experienced or advanced users, and the 
chapters that focus on advanced features and digital publishing contain the most signifi cant 
updates from previous versions of this book. Here you will discover the new capabilities of 
InDesign CS6 that impact most users.
About the Digital Publishing Suite
Along with generating digital documents for open standards such as PDF and ePub, Adobe is 
also trying to establish their own proprietary format for distributing digital documents. This 
format includes a per-issue fee that is paid to Adobe for every publication that is created, and 
requires content to be distributed, in part, through Adobe servers. These documents are created 
using the Adobe Digital Publishing suite of tools that expand the capabilities of InDesign.
While these tools may be used by some publishers, there is a high per-issue cost for documents 
created and distributed using the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. These costs are compounded 
by additional fees that Adobe charges based upon the number of downloads a publication 
receives. Because these fees put the digital publishing suite beyond the reach of many 
publishers, we have focused in this book only on the new features that pertain to the widest 
group of users and do not require paying any additional fees to distribute the content you 
create within InDesign. As very large magazines are exploring options for digital document 
distribution, the Digital Publishing suite is one of several options they are exploring. The ways 
for creating and distributing digital documents are still in their infancy, and several software 
companies, including Adobe, are working to develop possible solutions for publishers to create 
and distribute content across the variety of devices that are also rapidly evolving.

Lesson 13, Adobe InDesign CS6 New Features 
Content Collector 
Content Collector 
The Content Collector tool, Content Placer tool, and Content Conveyor allow you to 
pickup content from one layout and easily place it in another.
Using the Content Collector tool ( ) found in the Tools panel you can place items in the 
Content Conveyor located by default at the bottom of the InDesign workspace. Using the 
Content Collector tool, you can collect graphics or text frames by clicking on them. Once 
they are collected, you can reuse them.
The graphic from the page picked up with the Content Collector tool and loaded into 
the Content Conveyor.
The Content Placer tool ( ) is located at the bottom of the Content Conveyor, or in the 
Tools panel by clicking and holding on the Content Collector tool. When using the Content 
Placer tool, clicking the Create Link checkbox at the bottom of the Content Conveyor 
panel, any update the parent element will cause the child element to also be updated. You 
can learn more about using the InDesign CS6 Content Collector tool in Lesson 11.

13
Linked content 
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
440
Linked content 
If you are familiar with the Place and Link option added in a previous version of InDesign, 
then the Linked Content feature will appear familiar to you. The new Linked Content 
feature is really an enhanced version of the Place and Link feature. Using the Selection tool 
you can select content to be duplicated in other parts of a layout and choose Edit > Place 
and Link and then click to place a copy of the original content elsewhere in the layout. 
Updates to the original text or image are refl ected in the copies that are made in this way. 
When text is modifi ed in the parent layout, the child layout indicates that the link to the text has been modifi ed. 
You can also use the Content Placer tool to place linked content. When using the Content 
Collector tool, click the Create Link option before placing content on the page for the original 
item to be linked to the copy. You can learn more about Linked Content in Lesson 11.
You can also link duplicated content 
within the same document by clicking 
the Create Link option in the 
Content Collector tool.

Lesson 13, Adobe InDesign CS6 New Features 
Liquid layouts 
Liquid layouts 
Liquid Layout off ers multiple options for controlling how a layout is resized when the page 
size changes Access Liquid Layout by choosing Layout > Liquid Layout to open the Liquid 
Layout panel. 
There are four diff erent Liquid Page Rules you can use: 
• Scale
• Re-Center
• Object-based
• Guide-based. 
The Liquid Layout panel is used in conjunction with the Page tool ( ). After choosing 
Liquid Layout, use the page tool to drag the handles at the corners and sides of the page to 
resize the page and preview how the page will look at a diff erent size. Releasing the mouse 
causes the page to return to its original size. This makes it easier to experiment with 
diff erent layouts. Pressing the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac OS) before releasing 
the mouse causes the layout adjustment to be maintained. You can still use Edit > Undo to 
return to the original page dimensions.
Using the Page tool, drag the handles to resize the page.
The Scale Liquid Layout option causes all objects on a page to increase or decrease in size 
as the page itself is scaled.
The Recenter Liquid Layout option causes all the page content to be recentered on the page 
based on the new size. 

13
Liquid layouts 
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom

The Object-based Liquid Layout rule requires that you defi ne which objects you want 
to scale and which you want to maintain position. Select individual objects and use the 
Liquid Layout panel to specify how they each object is to be treated. 
Defi ning properties for the Object-based page rule (left) and the visual indicators that appear on 
the selected object (right).
The Guide-based Liquid Layout rule uses ruler guides to defi ne objects that should resize 
with the page Any object that has guides touching them are adjusted when the page is resized. 
Vertical guides control horizontal resizing and horizontal guides control vertical resizing.
You can learn more about Liquid Layouts in Lesson 11.

Alternate layouts make it easier to create projects with more than one version of a layout. 
Alternate layouts in InDesign CS6 make it so that changes to one layout get updated in all 
related layouts. 
Using the Pages panel and Window > Pages lets you access the Pages panel menu (
) 
where you choose the option to Create Alternate Layout.

Lesson 13, Adobe InDesign CS6 New Features 
PDF forms 
PDF forms 
Most forms are becoming web based, and are created using HTML and can display in 
any web browser on any device. PDF forms require the Adobe reader and tend to only 
display well on desktop and laptop computers, making them less useful for sharing to a 
large audience. But for users that require a form to look a certain way, such as a form that 
needed approval from a regulatory agency, there is still a need for PDF forms.
Adobe has added capabilities for creating PDF forms into InDesign CS6. Previously the 
look of the form could be designed using InDesign, but any PDF forms interactivity or 
PDF forms fi elds were added later using Adobe Acrobat. 
There are several types of form fi elds that you can create using InDesign including Check 
Box, Combo Box, List Box, Radio Buttons, Signature Fields, and Text Fields.

Primary text frame
Adobe InDesign CS6 Digital Classroom
446
Primary text frame
When creating a master page you can specify a primary text frame. A primary text frame 
is useful if you have one frame containing the majority of the text on a page, and the 
master page applied to that document page is subject to change. 
If a diff erent master page is applied to a document page that uses a primary text frame, the 
text automatically fl ows from the old primary text frame into the new primary text frame. 
Additionally, primary text frames can be worked with on a document page more easily, 
as they are automatically overridden and do not require any additional adjustments before 
using them in your layout.
You can designate a text frame on any master page as a primary text frame by clicking to 
select the frame and then clicking the primary text frame symbol located near the top of 
the left edge of a text frame. There is only one master text frame per master page.
A master text frame before being converted to a primary text frame (left) and after being converted 
to a primary text frame (right). Designate a primary text frame on a master page to more easily 
adjust text layout when a new master page is applied to a document page.

ePub enhancements
ePub enhancements
InDesign CS6 includes a number of updates that improve support for ePub. The most 
notable is InDesign’s support for the ePub 3.0 standard. This includes the ability to include 
multimedia content within an ePub. Many of the ePub enhancements for InDesign CS6 
are not visible when creating a document, and impact only the options available when 
exporting an InDesign fi le to the ePub format. You can learn more about creating ePub 
fi les from InDesign in Lesson 12.
InDesign CS6 supports the creation of ePub 3.0 fi les.
Congratulations, you have discovered the new capabilities of InDesign CS6.
