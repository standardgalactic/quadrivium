The NATO Science Series continues the series of books published formerly as the NATO ASI Series.
The NATO Science Programme offers support for collaboration in civil science between scientists of
countries of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The types of scientific meeting generally supported
are “Advanced Study Institutes” and “Advanced Research Workshops”, and the NATO Science Series
collects together the results of these meetings. The meetings are co-organized bij scientists from
NATO countries and scientists from NATO’s Partner countries – countries of the CIS and Central and
Eastern Europe.
Advanced Study Institutes are high-level tutorial courses offering in-depth study of latest advances
in a field.
Advanced Research Workshops are expert meetings aimed at critical assessment of a field, and
identification of directions for future action.
As a consequence of the restructuring of the NATO Science Programme in 1999, the NATO Science
Series was re-organised to the four sub-series noted above. Please consult the following web sites for
information on previous volumes published in the Series.

Preface
This book groups material that was used for the Marrakech 2002
School on Delay Diﬀerential Equations and Applications. The school
was held from September 9-21 2002 at the Semlalia College of Sciences
of the Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakech, Morocco. 47 participants and
15 instructors originating from 21 countries attended the school. Finan-
cial limitations only allowed support for part of the people from Africa
and Asia who had expressed their interest in the school and had hoped to
come. The school was supported by ﬁnancements from NATO-ASI (Nato
advanced School), the International Centre of Pure and Applied Mathe-
matics (CIMPA, Nice, France) and Cadi Ayyad University. The activity
of the school consisted in courses, plenary lectures (3) and communica-
tions (9), from Monday through Friday, 8.30 am to 6.30 pm. Courses
were divided into units of 45mn duration, taught by block of two units,
with a short 5mn break between two units within a block, and a 25mn
break between two blocks. The school was intended for mathematicians
willing to acquire some familiarity with delay diﬀerential equations or
enhance their knowledge on this subject. The aim was indeed to extend
the basic set of knowledge, including ordinary diﬀerential equations and
semilinear evolution equations, such as for example the diﬀusion-reaction
equations arising in morphogenesis or the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky chem-
ical reaction, and the classic approach for the resolution of these equa-
tions by perturbation, to equations having in addition terms involving
past values of the solution.
In order to achieve this goal, a training
programme was devised that may be summarized by the following three
keywords: the Cauchy problem, the variation of constants formula, local
study of equilibria. This deﬁnes the general method for the resolution of
semilinear evolution equations, such as the diﬀusion-reaction equation,
adapted to delay diﬀerential equations. The delay introduces speciﬁc
diﬀerences and diﬃculties which are taken into account in the progres-
sion of the course, the ﬁrst week having been devoted to “ordinary”
delay diﬀerential equations, such equations where the only independent
variable is the time variable; in addition, only the ﬁnite dimension was
xvii

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
considered. During the second week, attention was focused on “ordi-
nary” delay diﬀerential equations in inﬁnite dimensional vector spaces,
as well as on partial diﬀerential equations with delay. Aside the training
on the basic theory of delay diﬀerential equations, the course by John
Mallet-Paret during the ﬁrst week discussed very recent results moti-
vated by the problem of determining wave fronts in lattice diﬀerential
equations. The problem gives rise to a diﬀerential equation with de-
viated arguments (both retarded and advanced), which represents an
entirely new line of research. Also, during the second week, Hans-Otto
Walther presented results regarding existence and description of the at-
tractor of a scalar delay diﬀerential equation. Three plenary conferences
usefully extended the contents of the ﬁrst week courses. The main part
of the courses given in the school are reproduced as lectures notes in
this book. A quick description of the contents the book is given in the
general introduction.
As many events of this nature at that time, this school was under

Introduction
M. L. Hbid
This book is devoted to the theory of delay equations and applica-
tions. It consists of four parts, preceded by an overview by Professor
J.K. Hale. The ﬁrst part concerns some general results on the quanti-
tative aspects of non-linear delay diﬀerential equations, by Professor E.
Ait Dads, and a linear theory of delay diﬀerential equations (DDE) by
Professor F. Kappel. The second part deals with some qualitative the-
ory of DDE : normal forms, centre manifold and Hopf bifurcation theory
in ﬁnite dimension. This part groups the contributions of Professor T.
Faria, Doctor M. Ait Babram and Professor M.L. Hbid. The third part
corresponds to the contributions of Professors O. Arino, E. Sanchez,
T. Faria, M. Adimy and K. Ezzinbi.
It is devoted to discussions on
quantitative and qualitative aspects of functionnal diﬀerential equations
(FDE) in inﬁnite dimension. The last part contains the contributions of
Professors H.O. Walther, S. Ruan, L. Maniar and J. Arino.
Ait Dads’s contribution deals with a direct method to provide an
existence result; he then derives a number of typical properties of DDE
and their solutions.
An example of such exotic properties, discussed
in Ait Dads’s lectures, is the fact that, contrary to the ﬂow associated
with a smooth ordinary diﬀerential system of equations, which is a local
diﬀeomorphism for all times, the semiﬂow associated with a DDE does
not extend backward in time, degenerates in ﬁnite time and can even
vanish in ﬁnite time. Many such properties are not yet understood and
would certainly deserve to be thoroughly investigated. The results and
conjectures presented by Ait Dads are classical and are for most of them
taken from a recent monograph by J. Hale and S. Verduyn Lunel on
the subject. Their inclusion in the initiation to DDE proposed by Ait
Dads is mainly intended to allow readers to get some familiarity with
the subject and open their horizons and possibly entice their appetite
for exploring new avenues.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In his lecture notes, Franz Kappel presents the construction of the ele-
mentary solution of a linear DDE using the Laplace transform. Even if it
is possible to proceed by direct methods, the Laplace transform provides
an explicit expression of the elementary solution, useful in the study of
spectral properties of DDEs. Kappel also dealt with a fundamental is-
sue of the linear theory of delay diﬀerential equations, namely, that of
completeness, that is to say, when is the vector space spanned by the
eigenvectors total (dense in the state space)? This issue is tightly con-
nected with another delicate and still open one, the existence of “small”
solutions (solutions which approach zero at inﬁnity faster than any expo-
nential). This course extends the one that Prof. Kappel taught during
the ﬁrst school on delay diﬀerential equations held at the University of
Marrakech in 1995. The very complete and elaborate lecture notes he
provided for the course are in fact an extension of the ones written on
the occasion of the ﬁrst school. A ﬁrst application of the linear and
the semi linear theory presented by Ait Dads and Kappel is the study
of bifurcation of equilibria in nonlinear delay diﬀerential equations de-
pendent on one or several parameters. The typical framework here is
a DDE deﬁned in an open subset of the state space, rather a family
of such equations dependent upon one parameter, which possesses for
each value of the parameter a known equilibrium (the so-called “trivial
equilibrium”): one studies the stability of the equilibrium and the pos-
sible changes in the linear stability status and how these changes reﬂect
in the local dynamics of the nonlinear equation. Changes are expected
near values of the parameter for which the equilibrium is a center. The
delay introduces its own problems in that case, and these problems have
given rise to a variety of approaches, dependent on the nature of the
delay and, more recently, on the dimension of the underlying space of
trajectories.
The part undertaken jointly by M.L. Hbid and M. Ait Babram deals
with a panorama of the best known methods, then concentrates on a
method elaborated within the dynamical systems group at the Cadi
Ayyad University, that is, the direct Lyapunov method. This method
consists in looking for a Lyapunov function associated with the ordinary
diﬀerential equation obtained by restricting the DDE to a center mani-
fold. The Lyapunov function is determined recursively in the form of a
Taylor expansion. The same issue, in the context of partial diﬀerential
equations with delay, was dealt with by T. Faria in her lecture notes.
The method presented by Faria is an extension to this inﬁnite dimen-
sional frame of the well-known method of normal forms. The method
was presented both in the case of a delay diﬀerential equation and also
in the case when the equation is the sum of a delay diﬀerential equation

and a diﬀusion operator. Both Prof. Faria and Dr. Ait Babram discuss
the Bogdanov-Takens and the Hopf bifurcation singularities as exam-
ples, and give a generic scheme to approximate the center manifolds in
both cases of singularies (Hopf, Bogdanov-Takens, Hopf-Hopf, ..).
The lecture notes written by Professor Hans-Otto Walther are com-
posed of two independent parts: the ﬁrst part deals with the geometry
of the attractor of the dynamical system deﬁned by a scalar delay diﬀer-
ential equation with monotone feedback. Both a negative and a positive
feedback were envisaged by Walther and his coworkers. In collaboration
with Dr. Tibor Krisztin, from the University of Szeged, Hungary, and
Professor Jianhong Wu, Fields Institute, Toronto, Canada, very detailed
global results on the geometric nature of the attractor and the ﬂow along
the attractor were found. These results have been obtained within the
past ten years or so and are presented in a number of articles and mono-
graphs, the last one being more than 200 pages long. The course could
only give a general idea of the general procedure that was followed in
proving those results and was mainly intended to elicit the interest of
participants. The second part of Walther’s lecture notes is devoted to a
presentation of very recent results obtained by Walther in the study of
state-dependent delay diﬀerential equations.
The lectures notes by Professors O. Arino, K. Ezzinbi and M. Adimy,
and L. Maniar present approaches along the line of the semigroup theory.
These lectures prolong in the framework of inﬁnite dimension the pre-
sentations made during the ﬁrst part by Ait Dads and Kappel in the case
of ﬁnite dimensions. Altogether, they constitute a state of the art of the
treatment of the Cauchy problem in the frame of linear functional dif-
ferential equations. The equations under investigation range from delay
diﬀerential equations deﬁned by a bounded “delay” operator to equa-
tions in which the “delay” operator has a domain which is only part of
a larger space (it may be for example the sum of the Laplace operator
and a bounded operator), to neutral type equations in which the delay
appears also in the time derivative, to inﬁnite delay, both in the au-
tonomous and the non autonomous cases. The methods presented range
from the classical theory of strongly continuous semigroups to extrap-
olation theory, also including the theory of integrated semigroups and
the theory of perturbation by duality. Adimy and Ezzinbi dealt with a
general neutral equation perturbed by the Laplace operator. Arino pre-
sented a theory, elaborated in collaboration with Professor Eva Sanchez,
which extends to inﬁnite dimensions the classical linear theory, as it is
treated in the monograph by Hale and Lunel.
In his lecture notes, S. Ruan provides a thorough review of models
involving delays in ecology, pointing out the signiﬁcance of the delay.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Most of his concern is about stability, stability loss and the corresponding
changes in the dynamical features of the problem. The methods used by
Ruan are those developed by Faria and Magalhaes in a series of papers,
which have been extensively described by Faria in her lectures. Dr. J.
Arino discusses the issue of delay in models of epidemics.
Various aspects of the theory of delay diﬀerential equations are pre-
sented in this book, including the Cauchy problem, the linear theory in
ﬁnite and in inﬁnite dimensions, semilinear equations. Various types of
functional diﬀerential equations are considered in addition to the usual
DDE: neutral delay equations, equations with delay dependent upon the
starter, DDE with inﬁnite delay, stochastic DDE, etc. The methods of
resolution covered most of the currently known ones, starting from the
direct method, the semigroup approach, as well as the integrated semi-
group or the so-called sun-star approach. The lecture notes touched a
variety of issues, including the geometry of the attractor, the Hopf and
Bogdanov-Takens singularities. All this however is just a small portion
of the theory of DDE. We might name many subjects which haven’t
been or have just been brieﬂy mentioned in lectures notes: the second
Lyapunov method for the study of stability, the Lyapunov-Razumikin
method brieﬂy alluded to in the introductory lectures by Hale, the theory
of monotone (with respect to an order relation) semi ﬂows for DDE which
plays an important role in applications to ecology (cooperative systems)
was considered only in the scalar case (the equation with positive feed-
back in Walther’s course). The proliﬁc theory of oscillations for DDE
was not even mentioned, nor the DDE with impulses which are an im-
portant example in applications. The Morse decomposition, just brieﬂy
reviewed the “structural stability” approach, of fundamental importance
in applications where it notably justiﬁes robustness of model represen-
tations, a breakthrough accomplished during the 1985-1995 decade by
Mallet-Paret and coworkers is just mentioned in Walther’s course. Delay
diﬀerential equations have become a domain too wide for being covered
in just one book.

Delay diﬀerential equations, diﬀerential integral equations and func-
tional diﬀerential equations have been studied for at least 200 years (see
E. Schmitt (1911) for references and some properties of linear equa-
tions). Some of the early work originated from problems in geometry
and number theory.
At the international conference of mathematicians, Picard (1908) made
the following statement in which he emphasized the importance of the
consideration of hereditary eﬀects in the modeling of physical systems:
Les ´equations diﬀ´erentielles de la m´ecanique classique sont telles qu’il
en r´esulte que le mouvement est d´etermin´e par la simple connaissance
des positions et des vitesses, c’est-`a-dire par l’´etat `a un instant donn´e et
`a l’instant inﬁniment voison.
Les ´etats ant´erieurs n’y intervenant pas, l’h´er´edit´e y est un vain mot.
L’application de ces ´equations o`u le pass´e ne se distingue pas de l’avenir,
o`u les mouvements sont de nature r´eversible, sont donc inapplicables aux
ˆetres vivants.
Nous pouvons r´ever d’´equations fonctionnelles plus compliqu´ees que
les ´equations classiques parce qu’elles renfermeront en outre des int´egrales
prises entre un temps pass´e tr`es ´eloign´e et le temps actuel, qui ap-
porteront la part de l’h´er´edit´e.
Volterra (1909), (1928) discussed the integrodiﬀerential equations that
model viscoelasticity. In (1931), he wrote a fundamental book on the
role of hereditary eﬀects on models for the interaction of species.
The subject gained much momentum (especially in the Soviet Union)
after 1940 due to the consideration of meaningful models of engineering

systems and control. It is probably true that most engineers were well
aware of the fact that hereditary eﬀects occur in physical systems, but
this eﬀect was often ignored because there was insuﬃcient theory to
discuss such models in detail.
During the last 50 years, the theory of functional diﬀerential equations
has been developed extensively and has become part of the vocabulary
of researchers dealing with speciﬁc applications such as viscoelasticity,
mechanics, nuclear reactors, distributed networks, heat ﬂow, neural net-
works, combustion, interaction of species, microbiology, learning models,
epidemiology, physiology,as well as many others (see Kolmanovski and
Myshkis (1999)).
Stochastic eﬀects are also being considered but the theory is not as
well developed.
During the 1950’s, there was considerable activity in the subject which
led to important publications by Myshkis (1951), Krasovskii (1959), Bell-
man and Cooke (1963), Halanay (1966). These books give a clear picture
of the subject up to the early 1960’s.
Most research on functional diﬀerential equations (FDE) dealt primar-
ily with linear equations and the preservation of stability (or instability)
of equilibria under small nonlinear perturbations when the lineariza-
tion was stable (or unstable). For the linear equations with constant
coeﬃcients, it was natural to use the Laplace transform. This led to ex-
pansions of solutions in terms of the eigenfunctions and the convergence
properties of these expansions.
For the stability of equilibria, it was important to understand the
extent to which one could apply the second method of Lyapunov (1891).
The genesis of the modern theory evolved from the consideration of the
latter problem.
In these lectures, I describe a few problems for which the method of
solution, in my opinion, played a very important role in the modern
analytic and geometric theory of FDE. At the present time, much of the
subject can be considered as well developed as the corresponding one for
ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODE). Naturally, the topics chosen are
subjective and another person might have chosen completely diﬀerent
ones.
It took considerable time to take an idea from ODE and to ﬁnd the
appropriate way to express this idea in FDE. With our present knowl-
edge of FDE, it is diﬃcult not to wonder why most of the early papers
making connections between these two subjects were not written long
ago. However, the mode of thought on FDE at the time was contrary to
the new approach and sometimes not easily accepted. A new approach

was necessary to obtain results which were diﬃcult if not impossible to
obtain in the classical way.
We begin the discussion with retarded functional diﬀerential equations
(RFDE) with continuous initial data. If r ≥0 is a given constant, let
C = C([−r, 0], Rn) and, if x : [−r, α) →Rn, α > 0, let xt ∈C, t ∈[0, α),
be deﬁned by xt(θ) = x(t + θ), θ ∈[−r, 0]. If f : C →Rn is a given
function, a retarded FDE (RFDE) is deﬁned by the relation
x′(t) = f(xt)
(0.1)
If ϕ ∈C is given, then a solution x(t, ϕ) of (0.1) with initial value ϕ
at t = 0 is a continuous function deﬁned on an interval [−r, α), α > 0,
such that x0(θ) = x(θ, ϕ) = ϕ(θ) for θ ∈[−r, 0], x(t, ϕ) has a continuous
derivative on (0, α), a right hand derivative at t = 0 and satisﬁes (0.1)
for t ∈[0, α).
We remark that the notation in (0.1) is the modern one and essentially
due to Krasovskii (1956), where in (0.1), he would have written f(x(t +
θ)) with the understanding that he meant a functional. The notation
above was introduced by Hale (1963).
Results concerning existence, uniqueness and continuation of solu-
tions, as well as the dependence on parameters, are essentially the same
as for ODE with a few additional technicalites due to the inﬁnite dimen-
sional character of the problem. If f is continuous and takes bounded
sets into bounded sets, then there is a solution x(t, ϕ) through ϕ which
exists on a maximal interval [−r, αϕ).
Furthermore, if αϕ < ∞, then the solution becomes unbounded as
t →α−
ϕ. If f is Ck, then x(t, .) is Ck+1 and x(., ϕ) is Ck in ϕ in ([0, αϕ).
1.
Stability of equilibria and Lyapunov functions
One of the ﬁrst problems that occurs in diﬀerential equations is to
obtain conditions for stability of equilibria. Following Lyapunov, it is
reasonable to make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1 Suppose that 0 is an equilibrium point of (0.1); that is, a
zero of f. The point 0 is said to be stable if, for any ε > 0, there is a
δ > 0 such that for any ϕ ∈C with |ϕ| < δ, we have |x(t, ϕ)| < ε for
t ≥−r. The point 0 is asymptotically stable if it is stable and there is
b > 0 such that |ϕ| < b implies that |x(t, ϕ)| →0 as t →∞. The point 0
is said to be a local attractor if there is a neighborhood U of 0 such that
lim
t→∞dist(x(t, U), 0) = 0
that is, 0 attracts elements in U uniformly.

4
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In this deﬁnition, notice that the closeness of initial data is taken in C
whereas the closeness of solutions is in Rn. This is no restriction since,
if 0 is stable (resp., asymptotically stable), then |xt(., ϕ)| < ε for t ≥0
(resp. |xt(., ϕ)| →0 as t →∞).
As a consequence of the smoothing properties of solutions of (0.1),
one can
use essentially the same proof as for ODE to obtain the following
important result.
Proposition 1 An equilibrium point of (0.1) is asymptotically stable if
and only if it is a local attractor.
For linear retarded equations; that is, f : C →Rn a continuous linear
functional, there is a solution of the form exp (λt) c for some nonzero
n-vector c if and only if λ satisﬁes the characteristic equation
detD(λ) = 0, ∆(λ) = λI −f(exp −λ.)I).
(1.2)
The numbers λ are called the eigenvalues of the linear equation. Equa-
tion (1.2) may have inﬁnitely many solutions, but there can be only a
ﬁnite number in any vertical strip in the complex plane. This is a con-
sequence of the analyticity of (1.2) in λ and the fact that Reλ →−∞if
|λ| →∞.
The eigenvalues play an important role in stability of linear systems.
If there is an eigenvalue with positive real part, then the origin is un-
stable. For asymptotic stability, it is necessary and suﬃcient to have
each λ with real part < 0. The veriﬁcation of this property in a par-
ticular example is far from trivial and much research in the 1940’s and
1950’s was devoted to giving various methods for determining when the
λ satisfying (1.2) have real parts < 0 (see Bellman and Cooke (1963) for
detailed references).
If the RFDE is nonlinear, if 0 is an equilibrium with all eigenvalues
with negative real parts (resp.an eigenvalue with a positive real part),
then classical approaches using a variation of constants formula and
Gronwall type inequalities can be used to show that 0 is asymptotically
stable (resp.
unstable) for the nonlinear equation (see Bellman and
Cooke (1963)).
If the RFDE is nonlinear and 0 is an equilibrium and the zero solution
of the linear variational equation is not asymptotically stable and there
is no eigenvalue with positive real part, then classical methods give no
information. In this case, it is quite natural to attempt to adapt the well
known methods of Lyapunov to RFDE.
Two independent approaches to this problem were given in the early
1950’s by Razumikhin (1956) and Krasovskii (1956).

History Of Delay Equations
5
The approach of Razumikhin (1956) was to use Lyapunov functions on
Rn. Let us indicate a few details. If V : Rn →R is a given continuously
diﬀerentiable function and x(t, ϕ) is a solution of (0.1), we can deﬁne
V (x(t, ϕ)) and compute the derivative along the solution evaluated at
ϕ(0) as
.
V (ϕ(0)) = ∂V (ϕ(0))
∂x
f(ϕ) ≡G(ϕ).
(1.3)
If the RFDE is not an ODE, then the function
.
V (ϕ(0)) is not a function
from Rn to R, but is a function from C to R. As a consequence, we
cannot expect that the derivative in (1.3) is negative for all small initial
data ϕ.
To use such a method, one must consider a restricted set of initial
data which is relevant for the consideration of stability.
To illustrate how such conditions arise in a natural way, consider the
example
x′(t) = −ax(t) −bx(t −r)
(1.4)
where a > 0 and b are constants. If we chose V (x) = x2/2, then V is
positive deﬁnite from R to R and
V ′
1.4(x(t, ϕ)) = −ax2(t) −bx(t)x(t −r)
(1.5)
If we knew that the right hand side of (1.5) were ≤0, then we would know
that the zero solution of (1.4) is stable. Of course, this can never be true
for all functions in C in a neighborhood of zero. On the other hand, if 0
is not stable, then there is an ε > 0 such that, for any 0 < δ < ε, there
is a function ϕ with norm < δ and a time t1 > 0 such that |x(t1, ϕ)| = ε
and |x(t+θ, ϕ)| < ε for all θ ∈[−r, 0). As a consequence of this remark,
it is only necessary to ﬁnd conditions on b for which the right hand side
of (1.4) is ≤0 for those functions with the property that |ϕ|≤|ϕ(0)|. It
is clear that this can be done if |b|≤a. Therefore, 0 is stable if |b|≤a,
a > 0.
The origin is not asymptotically stable if a + b = 0 since 0
is an eigenvalue. We remark that this region in (a, b)-space coincides
with the region for which the origin of (1.4) is stable independent of the
delay. We have seen that it belongs to this region, but to show that it
coincides with this region requires more eﬀort (see, for example, Bellman
and Cooke (1963) or Hale and Lunel (1993)).
In this example, it is possible to show that all eigenvalues have neg-
ative real parts if |b| < a, a > 0. Is it possible to use the Lyapunov
function V (x) = x2/2 to prove this? For asymptotic stability, we must
show that
.
V (ϕ(0)) < 0 for a class of functions which at least includes
functions with the property that |ϕ| > |ϕ(0)|. It can be shown that it is
suﬃcient to have the class satisfy |ϕ|≤p|ϕ(0)| for some constant p > 1.

6
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Razumikhin (1956) gave general results in the spirit of the above ex-
ample to obtain suﬃcient conditions for stability and asymptotic stabil-
ity using functions on Rn.
Theorem 1 (Razumikhin) Suppose that u, v, w:[0, ∞) →[0, ∞) are con-
tinuous nondecreasing functions, u(s), v(s) positive for s > 0, u(0) =
v(0) = 0, v strictly increasing. If there is a continuous function V :Rn →
R such that u(|x|)≤V (x)≤v(|x|), x ∈Rn, and
.
V (ϕ(0))≤w(|ϕ(0)|), if
V (ϕ(θ))≤V (ϕ(0)), θ ∈[−r, 0], then the point 0 is stable.
In addition, if there is a continuous nondecreasing function p(s) > s for
s > 0 such that
.
V (ϕ(0))≤w(|ϕ(0)|) if V (ϕ(θ))≤p(V (ϕ(0))), θ ∈[−r, 0],
then 0 is asymptotically stable.
At about the same time as Razumikhin, Krasovskii (1956) was also
discussing stability of equilibria and wanted to make sure that all of
the results for ODE using Lyapunov functions could be carried over to
RFDE. The idea now seems quite simple, but, at the time, it was not
the way in which FDE were being discussed.
The state space for FDE should be the space Csince this is the amount
of information that is needed to determine a solution of the equation.
This is the observation made by Krasovskii (1956). He was then able to
extend the complete theory of Lyapunov by using functionals V : C →
R. We state a result on stability.
Theorem 2 . (Krasovskii) Suppose that u, v, w : [0, ∞) →[0, ∞) are
continuous nonnegative nondecreasing functions, u(s), v(s) positive for
s > 0, u(0) = v(0) = 0. If there is a continuous function V : C →R
such that
u(|ϕ(0)|)≤V (ϕ)≤v(|ϕ|), ϕ ∈C,
.
V (ϕ) = lim sup
t→0
1
t [V (xt(., ϕ)) −V (ϕ)]≤−w(|ϕ(0)|)
then 0 is stable. If, in addition, w(s) > 0 for s > 0, then 0 is asymptot-
ically stable.
Let us apply the Theorem of Krasovskii to the example (1.4) with
V (ϕ) = 1
2ϕ2(0) + µ
 0
−r
ϕ2(θ)dθ,
where µ is a positive constant. A simple computation shows that
.
V (ϕ) = −(a −µ)ϕ2(0) −bϕ(0)ϕ(−r) −µϕ2(−r).

The right hand side of this equation is a quadratic form in (ϕ(0), ϕ(−r)).
If we ﬁnd the region in parameter space for which this quadratic form
is nonnegative, then the origin is stable. If it positive deﬁnite, then it is
asymptotically stable. The condition for nonnegativeness is a ≥µ > 0,
4(a −µ)µ ≥b2 and positive deﬁniteness if the inequalities are replaced
by strict inequalities. To obtain the largest region in the (a, b) space
for which these relations are satisﬁed, we should choose µ = a/2, which
gives the region of stability as a ≥|b| and asymptotic stability as a > |b|,
which is the same result as before using Razumikhin functions.
For more details, generalizations and examples, see Hale and Lunel
(1993), Kolmanovski and Myshkis (1999).
2.
Invariant Sets, Omega-limits and Lyapunov
functionals.
The suggestion made by Krasovskii that one should exploit the fact
that the natural state space for RFDE should be C opened up the pos-
sibility of obtaining a theory of RFDE which would be as general as
that available for ODE. Following this idea, Shimanov (1959) gave some
interesting results on stability when the linearization has a zero eigen-
value.
This could not have been done without working in the phase
space C and exploiting some properties of linear systems which will be
mentioned later.
I personally had been thinking about delay equations in the 1950’s
and reading the RAND report of Bellman and Danskin (1954).
The
methods there did not seem to be appropriate for a general development
of the subject.
In 1959, it was a revelation when Lefschetz gave me
a copy of Krasovskii’s book (in Russian). I began to work very hard
to try to obtain interesting results for RFDE on concepts which were
well known to be important for ODE. My ﬁrst works were devoted to
understanding the neighborhood of an equilibrium point (stable and
unstable manifolds) and to deﬁning invariant sets in a way that could
be useful for applications.
In the present section, it is best to describe invariance since the ﬁrst
important application was related to stability.
For simplicity, let us
suppose that, for every ϕ ∈C, the solution x(t, ϕ) through ϕ ∈C at
t = 0 is deﬁned for all t ≥0. If we deﬁne the family of transformations
T(t) : C →C by the relation T(t)ϕ = xt(., ϕ), t ≥0, then {T(t), t ≥0}
is a semigroup on C; that is
T(0) = I, T(t + τ) = T(t)T(τ), t, τ ≥0.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The smoothness of T(t)ϕ in ϕ is the same as the smoothness of f and,
for t ≥r, T(t) is a completely continuous operator since, for each ϕ, the
solution x(t, ϕ) is diﬀerentiable for t ≥r.
Deﬁnition 2 :The positive orbit γ+(ϕ) through ϕ is the set {T(t)ϕ, t ≥
0}.
A set A ⊂C is an invariant set for T(t), t ≥0, if T(t)A = A, t ≥0.
The ω−limit set of ϕ ∈C, denoted by ω(ϕ), is
ω(ϕ) = ∩
τ≥0Cl(γ+(T(τ)ϕ)).
The ω−limit set of a subset B in C, denoted by ω(B), is
ω(B) = ∩
τ≥0Clγ+(T(τ)B)).
Note that a function ψ ∈ω(ϕ) if and only if there is a sequence tn →
∞as n →∞such that T(tn)ϕ →ψ as n →∞. A function ψ ∈ω(B) if
and only if there exist sequences {ϕn, n = 1, 2, ...} ⊂B and tn →∞as
n →∞such that T(tn)ϕn →ψ as n →∞. We remark that ω(B) may
not be equal to
∪
ϕ∈Bω(ϕ). This is easily seen from the ODE x′ = x −x3,
x ∈R.
If A is invariant, then, for any ϕ ∈A, there is a preimage and, thus,
it is possible to deﬁne negative orbits through ϕ. This is not possible for
all ϕ ∈C since a solution of (0.1) becomes continuously diﬀerentiable
for t ≥r. Also, there may not be a unique negative orbit through ϕ ∈
A.
A set A in C attracts a set B in C if dist(T(t)B, A) →0 as t →∞.
The following result is consequence of the fact that T(r) is completely
continuous.
Theorem 3 : If B ⊂C is such that γ+(B) is bounded, then ω(B) is a
indexxcompact invariant set which attracts B under the ﬂow deﬁned by
(0.1) and is connected if B is connected.
The following result is a natural generalization of the classical LaSalle
invariance principle for ODE.
Theorem 4 : (Hale, 1963) Let V be a continuous scalar function on
C with
.
V (ϕ)≤0 for all ϕ ∈C. If Ua = {ϕ ∈C : V (ϕ)≤a}, Wa = {ϕ ∈
Ua :
.
V (ϕ) = 0} and
M is the maximal invariant set in Wa, then, for
any ϕ ∈Ua for which γ+(ϕ) is bounded, we have ω(ϕ) ⊂M.
If Ua is a bounded set, then M = ω(Ua) is compact invariant and
attracts Ua under the ﬂow deﬁned by (0.1). If Ua is connected, so is M.

To the author’s knowledge, these concepts for RFDE were frist intro-
duced in Hale (1963) and were used to give a simple proof of convergence
for the Levin-Nohel equation

Theorem 5 :. (Levin-Nohel) 1). If a is not a linear function, then, for
any ϕ ∈C, ω(ϕ) is a zero of g.
2). If a is a linear function, then, for any ϕ ∈C, ω(ϕ) is an r-peroidic
orbit in C deﬁned by an r-periodic solution of the ODE
y′′ + g(y) = 0.
We outline the proof of Hale (1963) which is independent of the one
given by Levin and Nohel. However, we will use their clever choice of a
Lyapunov function. If

The hypotheses imply that

V (ϕ)≤0 and γ+(ϕ) is bounded for each ϕ ∈
C.
To apply the above theorem, we need to investigate the set where
.
V = 0.
To do this, we observe that any solution of (2.6) also must
satisfy the equation

(2.7)
If a is not a linear function, then there is an s0 such that a′′(s0) ̸= 0 and
there is an interval Is0 of s0 such that a′′(s) ̸= 0 for s ∈Is0.
Integrating the second order ODE from −s to 0 and using (2.7), we
observe that y is periodic of period s for every s ∈.Is0. Thus, y is a
constant and ω(ϕ) belongs to the set of zeros of g. Since the zeros of g
are isolated and ω(ϕ) is connected, we have the conclusion in part 1 of
the theorem.
If a is a linear function, then we must be concerned with the solutions
of the ODE for which
 0
−r g(y(t+θ))dθ = 0. As before, this implies that y′
is periodic of period r and there is a constant k such that y(t) = kt+(a
periodic function of period r). Boundedness of y implies that y(t) is
r-periodic. This shows that ω(ϕ) belongs to the set of periodic orbits
generated by r-periodic solutions of the ODE. To prove that the ω−limit
set is a single periodic orbit requires an argument using techniques in
ODE which we omit.

Delays may cause instability.
In his study of the control of the motion of a ship with movable bal-
last, Minorsky (1941) (see also Minorsky (1962)) made a realistic math-
ematical model which contained a delay (representing the time for the
readjustment of the ballast) and observed that the motion was oscilla-
tory if the delay was too large. An equation was also encountered in
prime number theory by Wright (1955) which had the same property.
It was many years later that S. Jones (1962) gave a procedure for de-
termining the existence of a periodic solution of delay diﬀerential equa-
tions which has become a standard tool in this area. I describe this for
the equation of Wright
x′(t) = −αx(t −1)(1 + x(t)),
(3.8)
where α > 0 is a constant.
The equation (3.8) has two equilibria x = 0 and x = −1. The set
C−1 = {ϕ ∈C : ϕ(0) = −1} is the translation of a codimension one sub-
space of C and is invariant under the ﬂow deﬁned by (3.8). Furthermore,
any solution with initial data in C−1 is equal to the constant function
−1 for t ≥1. The linear variational equation about x = −1 has only the
eigenvalue α > 0 and is, therefore, unstable.

The set C−1 serves as a natural barrier for the solutions of (3.8). In
fact, if a solution has initial data ϕ for which ϕ(0) ̸= −1, then the
solution x(t) ̸= −1 for all t ≥0 for which it is deﬁned. In fact, if x(t) is
a solution of (3.8) through a point ϕ ∈C with ϕ(0) ̸= −1, then, for any
t0 for which x(t0) ̸= −1 and any t ≥t0,
1 + x(t) = [1 + x(t0)] exp(−α
 t−1
t0−1
x(s)ds}
(3.9)
This proves the assertion.
The sets C−= {ϕ ∈C : ϕ(0) < −1} and C+ = {ϕ ∈C : ϕ(0) > −1}
are positively invariant under the ﬂow deﬁned by (3.18). If ϕ ∈C−, it
is not diﬃcult to show that x(t, ϕ) →−∞as t →∞.
As a consequence of these remarks, we discuss this equation in the
subset C+ of C.
If ϕ ∈C+, then (3.9) shows that a solution x(t) cannot become un-
bounded on a ﬁnite interval, each solution exists for all t ≥0 and (3.8)
deﬁnes a semigroup Tα(t) : C+ →C+, t ≥0, where Tα(t)ϕ = xt(., ϕ). It
also is clear that Tα(t) is a bounded map for each t ≥0.
It is possible to show that, for each ϕ ∈C+, there is a t0(ϕ, α) such
that |Tα(t)ϕ|≤exp α−1 for t ≥t0(ϕ, α). As a consequence of some later
remarks, this implies the existence of the compact global attractor A of
(3.8); that is, A is compact, invariant and attracts bounded sets of C.
Wright (1955) proved that every solution approaches zero as t →∞
if 0 < α < exp(−1) and this implies that {0} is the compact global
attractor for (3.8). Yorke (1970) extended this result (even for more
general equations) to the interval 0 < α < 3/2.
The eigenvalues of the linearization about zero of (3.8) are the solu-
tions of the equation, λ + α exp(−λ) = 0. The eigenvalues have negative
real parts for 0 < α < π
2 , a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues for
α = π
2
with the remaining ones having negative real parts and, For
α > π
2 , there is a unique pair of eigenvalues with maximal real part > 0.
It is reasonable to conjecture that A = {0} for 0 < α < π
2 , but this has
not been proved. On the other hand, there is the following interesting
result.
Theorem 6 : (Jones (1962)) If α > π
2 , equation ( 3.8) has a periodic
solution oscillating about 0 and with the property that the distance be-
tween zeros is greater than the delay.
We indicate the ideas in the original proof of Jones (1962). Numerical
computations suggested that there should be such a solution with simple

12
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
zeros and the distance from a zero to the next maximum (or minimum) is
≥the delay. Let K ⊂C be deﬁned as K = Cl{nondecreasing functions
ϕ ∈C: ϕ(−1) = 0, ϕ(θ) > 0, θ ∈( −1, 0]}
Tα(t1)ϕ ∈K.
This deﬁnes a Poincar´e map Pα:ϕ ∈K maps to
Tα(t1)ϕ ∈K if we deﬁne Pα0 = 0.
One can show that this map is completely continuous.
A nontrivial ﬁxed point of Pα yields a periodic solution of (3.18) with
the properties stated in the above theorem. The main diﬃculty in the
proof of the theorem is that 0 ∈K is a ﬁxed point of Pα and one wants
a nontrivial ﬁxed point. The point 0 ∈K is unstable and Jones was able
to use this to show eventually that he could obtain the desired ﬁxed
point from Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem.
Many reﬁnements have been made of this method using interesting
ejective ﬁxed point theorems (which were discovered because of this
problem) (see Browder (1965), Nussbaum (1974)). In the above problem,
the point 0 is ejective. Grafton (1969) showed that the use of unstable
manifold theory could be of assistance in the veriﬁcation of ejectivity.
See, for example, Hale and Lunel (1993), Diekmann, van Giles, Lunel
and Walther (1991).

Linear autonomous equations and
perturbations.
Prior to Krasovskii, and even after, most researchers discussed linear
autonomous equations and perturbations of such equations by consider-
ing properties of the solution x(t, ϕ) in Rn. Such an approach limits the
extent to which one can obtain many of the interesting properties that
are similar to the ones for ODE.
In the approach of Krasovskii, a linear autonomous equation generates
a C0-semigroup on C which is compact for t ≥r. Therefore, the spec-
trum is only point spectrum plus possibly 0. The inﬁnitesimal generator
has compact resolvent with only point spectrum. The point spectrum
of the generator determines the point spectrum of the semigroup by ex-
ponentiation. This suggests a decomposition theory into invariant sub-
spaces similar to ones used for ODE. Shimanov (1959) exploited this fact
to discuss the stability of an equilibrium point for a nonlinear equation
for which the linear variational equation had a simple zero eigenvalue
and the remaining ones had negative real parts. The complete theory of
the linear case was developed by Hale (1963) (see also Shimanov (1965)).
Since linear equations are to be discussed in detail in this summer
workshop, we are content to give only an indication of the results with
a few applications.

Consider the equation
x′(t) = Lxt,
(4.10)
where L : C →Rn is a bounded linear operator. Equation (4.10) gener-
ates a C0-semigroup TL(t), t ≥0, on C which is completely continuous
for t ≥r. Therefore, the spectrum σ(TL(t)) consists only of point spec-
trum σp(TL(t)) plus possible zero.
The inﬁnitesimal generator AL is easily shown to be given by
D(AL) = {ϕ ∈C1([−r, 0], Rn) : ϕ′(0) = Lϕ}, ALϕ = ϕ′
(4.11)
The operator AL has compact resolvent and the spectrum is given
σ(AL) = {λ : ≩(λ) = 0}, ≩(λ) = λI −L exp(λ.)I}.
(4.12)
In any vertical strip in the complex plane, there are only a ﬁnite num-
ber of elements of σ(AL). If λ ∈σ(AL), then the generalized eigenspace
Mλof λ is ﬁnite dimensional, say of dimension dλ. If φλ = (ϕ1, ......., ϕdλ)
is a basis for Mλ, then there is a dλ× dλ matrix Bλ such that
ALφ = φBλ, [φ] = Mλ,
where [φ] denotes span.
From the deﬁnition of AL, it is easily shown that Mλ is invariant
under TL(t) and
TL(t)φ = φ exp (Bλt) , t ∈R.
There is a complementary subspace M⊥
λ ⊂C of Mλ such that
C = Mλ ⊕M⊥
λ , TL(t)M⊥
λ ⊂M⊥
λ , t ≥0,
(4.13)
Of course, such a decompostion can be applied to any ﬁnite set of ele-
ments of σ(AL).
In applications of this decompostion theory, it is necessary to have a
speciﬁc computational method to construct the complementary suspace.
This was done in detail by using an equation which is the ‘adjoint’ of
(4.10) (see, for example, Hale (1963), Shimanov (1965), Hale (1977),
Hale and Lunel (1993), Diekmann, van Giles, Lunel and Walther (1991)).
Consider now a perturbed linear system
x′(t) = Lxt + f(t),
(4.14)
where f : R →Rn is a continuous function.
In ODE, the variation
of constants formula plays a very important role in understanding the
eﬀects of f on the dynamics. For RFDE, a variation of constants formula
is implicitly stated in Bellman and Cooke (1963), Halanay (1965). It is

14
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
not diﬃcult to show that there is a solution X(t) = X(t, X0) of (4.10)
through the n × n discontinuous matrix function X0 deﬁned by
X0(θ) = 0, θ ∈[−r, 0) ,X0(0) = I, θ = 0.
(4.15)
With this function X(t) and deﬁning Xt = T(t)X0, it can be shown that
the solution x(t) = x(t, ϕ) of (4.14) through ϕ is given by
xt = T(t)ϕ +
 t
0
T(t −s)X0f(s)ds, t ≥0.
(4.16)
The equation (4.16) is not a Banach integral. For each θ ∈[−r, 0], the
equation (4.16) is to be interpreted as an integral equation in Rn.
The equation (4.16), interpreted in the above way, was used in the
development of many of the ﬁrst fundamental results in RFDE (see, for
example, Hale (1977)). The Banach space version of the variation of
constants formula makes use of sun-reﬂexive spaces and there also is a
theory based on integrated semigroups (see Diekmann, van Giles, Lunel
and Walther (1991) for a discussion and references).
With (4.16) and the above decomposition theory, it is possible to make
a decomposition in the variation of constants formula. We outline the
procedure and the reader may consult Hale (1963), (1977) or Hale and
Lunel (1993) for details.
Let x(t) = x(t, ϕ) be a solution of (4.14) with initial value ϕ at t = 0,
choose an element λ ∈σ(AL) and make the decomposition as in (4.13),
letting
ϕ = ϕλ + ϕ⊥
λ X0 = X0,λ + X⊥
0,λ, xt = xt,λ + x⊥
t,λ
(4.17)
The decomposition on X0 needs to be and can be justiﬁed.
If we apply this decomposition to (4.16), we obtain the equations

(4.18)
If we use the fact that Tλ(t)φλ = φ exp(Bλt) and let xt,λ = φy(t), and,
for simplicity in notation, x⊥
t,λ = zt, then we have
y(t) = exp(Bλt)a +

(4.19)

where a = y(0) and X0,λ = φK with K being a dλ × dλ matrix. The
ﬁrst equation in (4.19) is equivalent to an ODE
y′ = Bλy + Kf(t)
(4.20)
with y(0) = a.
At the time that this decomposition in C was given for the nonho-
mogeneous equation, it was not readily accepted by many people that
were working on RFDE. The main reason was that we now have the so-
lution expressed as two variable functions φy(t) and zt of t and, if f ̸= 0,
then neither of these functions can be represented by functions of t + θ,
θ ∈[−r, 0]. Therefore, neither function can satisfy an RFDE. Their sum
yields a function xt which does satisfy this property.
In spite of the apparent discrepancy, it is precisely this type of de-
composition that permits us to obtain qualitative results similar to the
ones in ODE. The ﬁrst such result was given by Hale and Perello (1964)
when they deﬁned the stable and unstable sets for an equilibrium point
and proved the existence and regularity of the local stable and unstable
manifolds of an equilibrium for which no eigenvalues lie on the imagi-
nary axis; that is, they proved that the saddle point property was valid
for hyperbolic equilibria. The proof involved using Lyapunov type inte-
grals to obtain each of these manifolds as graphs in C (see, for example,
Hale (1977), Hale and Lunel (1993) or Diekmann, van Giles, Lunel and
Walther (1991)). We now know that further extensions give a more com-
plete description of the neighborhood of an equilibrium including center
manifolds, foliations, etc.
Another situation that was of considerable interest in the late 1950’s
and 1960’s was the consideration of perturbed systems of the form
x′(t) = Lxt + M(t, xt),
(4.21)
where, for example, M(t, ϕ) is continuous and linear in ϕ and there is a
function a(t) such that
|M(t, ϕ)|≤a(t)|ϕ|, t ≥0,
(4.22)
and the function ais small in some sense. The problem is to determine
conditions on ato ensure that the behavior of solutions of (4.21) are
similar to the solutions of (4.10).
For example, Bellman and Cooke (1959) considered the following
problem. Suppose that xis a scalar, λ is an eigenvalue of (4.10)and there
are no other eigenvalues with the same real parts. Determine conditions
on aso that there is a solution of (4.21) which asymptotically as t →∞
behaves as the solution exp λt of (4.10). Their approach was to replace

16
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
a solution x(t) of (4.14) by a function w(t) ∈Rn by the transformation
x(t) = (exp λt) w(t) in Rn. In this case, the function w(t) will satisfy a
RFDE and the problem is to show that w(t) →0 as t →∞. In the case
where a(t) →0 as t →∞and
 ∞
0 |a(t)|dt may be ∞, it was necessary
to impose several additional conditions on a to ensure that w(t) →0 as
t →∞. Some of these conditions seemed to be artiﬁcial and were not
needed for ODE.
Another way to solve this type of problem is to make the transforma-
tion in C given by xt = exp(λt)zt and determine conditions on zt so that
zt →0 in C as t →∞. In this case, the function zt does not satisfy an
RFDE. On the other hand, some of the unnatural conditions imposed
by Bellman an Cooke (1959) were shown to be unnecessary (see Hale
(1966)).
5.
Neutral Functional Diﬀerential Equations
Neutral functional diﬀerential equations have the form
x′(t) = f(xt, x′
t);
(5.23)
that is, x′(t) depends not only upon the past history of x but also on
the past history of x′. Let X, Y be Banach spaces of functions mapping
the interval [−r, 0] into Rn. We say that x(t, ϕ, ψ) is a solution of (5.23)
through (ϕ, ψ) ∈X × Y , if x(t, ϕ, ψ) is deﬁned on an interval [−r, α),
α > 0, x0(., ϕ, ψ) = ϕ, x′
0(., ϕ, ψ) = ψ and satisﬁes (5.23) in a sense
consistent with the deﬁnitions of the spaces X and Y .
For example, if X = C([−r, 0], Rn), Y = L([−r, 0], Rn), then the
solution should be continuous with an integrable derivative and satisfy
(5.23) almost everywhere.
The proper function spaces depend upon the class of functions f that
are being considered. For a general discussion of this point, see Kol-
manovskii and Myskis (1999).
From my personal point of view, it is important to isolate classes
of neutral equations for which it is possible to obtain a theory which
is as complete as the one for the RFDE considered above. Hale and
Meyer (1967) introduced such a general class of neutral equations which
were motivated by transport problems (for example, lossless transmis-
sion lines with nonlinear boundary conditions) and could be considered
as a natural generalization of RFDE in the space C. We describe the
class and state a few of the important results. The detailed study of
this class of equations required several new concepts and methods which
have been used in the study of other evolutionary equations (with or
without hereditary eﬀects); for example, damped hyperbolic partial dif-

ferential equations and other partial diﬀerential equations of engineering
and physics.
Suppose that D, f : C →Rn are continuous and D is linear and
atomic at 0; that is,
Dϕ = ϕ(0) −
 0
−r
[dµ(θ)]ϕ(θ)
and the measure µ has zero atom at 0. The equation
d
dtDxt = f(xt)
(5.24)
is called a neutral FDE (NFDE). If Dϕ = ϕ(0), we have RFDE.
For any ϕ ∈C, a function x(t, ϕ) is said to be a solution of (5.24)
through ϕ at t = 0 if it is deﬁned and continuous on an interval [−r, α),
α > 0, x0(., ϕ) = ϕ, the function Dxt(., ϕ) is continuously diﬀerentiable
on (0, α) with a right hand derivative at t = 0 and satisﬁes (5.24) on
[0, α].
It is important to note that the function D(xt(., ϕ)) is required to be
diﬀerentiable and not the function x(t, ϕ).
Except for a few technical considerations, the basic theory of exis-
tence, uniqueness, continuation, continuous dependence on parameters,
etc. are essentially the same as for RFDE.
As before, if we let TD,f(t)ϕ = xt(., ϕ) and suppose that all solutions
are deﬁned for all t ≥0, then TD,f(t), t ≥0, is a semigroup on C with
TD,f(t)ϕ a Ck-function in ϕ if f is a Ck-function.
It is easily shown that the inﬁnitesimal generator AD,f of T(t) is given
by
D(AD,f) = {ϕ ∈C1([−r, 0], Rn) : D(ϕ′) = f(ϕ), AD,fϕ = ϕ′.
(5.25)
Hale and Meyer (1967) considered (5.24) when the function f was lin-
ear and were interested in the determination of conditions for stability
of the origin with these conditions being based upon properties of the
generator AD,f. It was shown that, if the spectrum of AD,f was uni-
formly bounded away from the imaginary axis and in the left half of the
complex plane, then one could obtain uniform exponential decay rate for
solutions provided that the initial data belonged to the domain of AD,f.
Of course, this should not be the best result and one should get these
uniform decay rates for any initial data in C. This was proved by Cruz
and Hale (1971), Corollary 4.1, and a more reﬁned result was given by
Henry (1974).
Due to the fact that the solutions of a RFDE are diﬀerentiable for
t ≥r, the corresponding semigroup is completely continuous for t ≥r.

18
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Such a nice property cannot hold for a general NFDE since the solutions
have the same smoothness as the initial data. On the other hand, there is
a representation of the semigroup for a NFDE as a completely continuous
perturbation of the semigroup generated by a diﬀerence equation related
to the operator D.
To describe this in detail, suppose that

Let CD0be the linear subspace of C deﬁned by
CD0 = {ϕ ∈C : D0ϕ = 0}
and let TD0(t), t ≥0, be the semigroup on CD0 deﬁned by TD0(t) =
yt(., ϕ), where y(t, ϕ) is the solution of the diﬀerence equation
D0yt = 0, y0 = ϕ ∈CD0.
(5.27)
Theorem 7 :
(Representation of solution operator}) There are a
bounded linear operator ψ:C →CD0 and a completely continuous op-
erator UD,f(t) : C →C, t ≥0, such that
TD,f(t) = TD0(t)ψ + UD,f(t), t ≥0.
(5.28)
Using results in Cruz and Hale (1971), the representation theorem
was proved in Hale (1970) for the situation where Dis an exponentially
stable operator. The proof in that paper clearly shows that it is only
required that D0 is an exponentially stable operator. Henry (1974) also
gave such a representation of the semigroup for (5.24).
In the statement of the above theorem, there is the mysterious linear
operator ψ : C →CD0. Let us indicate how it is constructed. For RFDE,
D0ϕ = ϕ(0) and ψϕ = ϕ −ϕ(0), which is just a translation of the initial
function in order to have ψϕ ∈CD0. For general D0, one ﬁrst chooses
a matrix function φ = (ϕ1, ......, ϕn), ϕj ∈C, j ≥1, so that D0(φ) = I,
the identity and then set ψ = I −φD0.
The
representation
(5.28)
shows
that
the
essential
spectrum
σess(TD,f(t)) of the operator TD,f(t) on C coincides with the essential
spectrum σess(TD0(t)) of TD0(t) on CD0. It can be shown (see Henry
(1987)) that the spectrum σ(TD0(t)) of TD0(t) coincides with its essen-

(5.29)
We say that the operator D0 is exponentially stable if σ(TD0(t)) for t > 0
is inside the unit circle with center zero in the complex plane. In this
case, there are constants KD0 ≥1, αD0 > 0 such that
|TD0(t)ϕ| ≤KD0 exp −αD0t , t ≥0, ϕ ∈CD0.
(5.30)
As a consequence, there is a constant K1 such that
|TD0(t)ψϕ| ≤KD0K1 exp −αD0t, t ≥0, ϕ ∈C.
(5.31)
We remark that, if D0 is exponentially stable, it is possible to ﬁnd an
equivalent norm in C such that KD0K1 = 1; that is, TD0(t)ψ is a strict
contraction for each t > 0. In this norm, relation (5.28) implies that
TD,f(t) is the sum of a strict contraction and a completely continuous
operator for each t > 0.
For the RFDE, Dϕ = D0ϕ = ϕ(0) and D0 is exponential stable since
the solutions of the diﬀerence equation x(t) = 0 on {ϕ ∈C : ϕ(0) = 0} is
identically zero for t ≥r and has the spectrum of the semigroup consist-
ing only of the point 0. This fact implies that the semigroup is compact
for t ≥r as we have noted before. The representation (5.28) says more
since it gives properties of the semigroup on the interval [0, r] as the
sum of an exponentially decaying semigroup and a completely continu-
ous semigroup. We make an application of this later when we discuss
periodic solutions of time varying systems with periodic dependence on
time.
If D0ϕ = ϕ(0) −aϕ(−r), then D0 is exponentially stable if and only
if |a| < 1 and ress(TD0(t)) = |a|t.
Stability of an equilibrium point of a NFDE is deﬁned in the same
way as for RFDE. We remark that, for general NFDE, an equilibrium
point being asymptotically stable does not imply that the equilibrium
point is a local attractor. In fact, it is possible to have a linear system
d
dtDxt = Lxt
for which every solution approaches zero as t →∞, 0 is stable and is
not a local attractor. In this case, the essential spectral radius of the
semigroup (and therefore of TD0(t)) must be equal to one for all t ≥0.
In fact, if there is a t1 > 0 such that it is less that one, then the above

20
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
representation formula implies that, if the solutions approach zero as
t →∞, then the spectrum of the semigroup for t > 0 must be inside the
unit circle and 0 would be a local attractor.
The example
d
dt[x(t) −ax(t −1)] = −cx(t)
with |a| = 1 and c > 0 has the property just stated. It is an interesting
exercise to verify this fact.
Much of the theory for RFDE has been carried over to NFDE if the
operator D0 is exponentially stable. However, there are many aspects
that have not yet been explored (see Hale and Lunel (1993), Hale, Ma-
galhaes and Oliva (2002)).

Periodically forced systems and discrete
dynamical systems.
If X is a Banach space and T : X →X is a continuous map, we obtain
a discrete dynamical system by considering the iterates T n, n ≥0, of the
map. Positive orbits, ω−limit sets, invariance, etc. are deﬁned the same
way as for continuous semigroups.
In the context of the present lectures, we can obtain a discrete dy-
namical system in the following way. If the RFDE or NFDE is nonau-
tonomous with the time dependence being τ-periodic, we can deﬁne the
Poincar´e map π : C →C which takes the initial data ϕ ∈C to the solu-
tion xt(., ϕ) at time τ. The map π deﬁnes a discrete dynamical system.
Fixed points of π correspond to periodic solutions of the equation with
the same period as the forcing.
In his study of the periodically forced van der Pol equation, Levinson
(1944) attempted to determine the existence of a periodic solution of
the same period as the forcing. To do this, he introduced the concept of
point dissipativeness described below and was able to use the Brouwer
ﬁxed point theorem to prove that some iterate of the Poincar´e map had
a ﬁxed point, but he could not prove that the map itsef had a ﬁxed
point.
Massera (1950) gave an example of a 2-dimensional ODE with τ-
periodic coeﬃcients which had a 2τ-periodic solution, but did not have
a τ-periodic solution. In addition, all solutions were bounded.
This shows that dissipation is necessary if the diﬀerential system of
Levinson is to have a τ-periodic solution. There was a successful solution
to this problem which we describe in the next section.

Dissipation, maximal compact invariant sets
and attractors.
We have seen above that dissipation can perhaps be beneﬁcial. In
many important applications, there is dissipation which forces solutions
with large initial data away from inﬁnity; that is, ‘inﬁnity is unstable.’
It is important to understand the implications of such a concept for both
autonomous and nonautonomous problems.
In this section, we introduce the new concepts that are needed for
continuous dynamical systems deﬁned by a C0-semigroup T(t), t ≥0,
as well as discrete dynamical systems {T n, n = 0, 1, 2, ........} deﬁned by
a map T on a Banach space X. To write things in a uniﬁed way, we let
ℑ+ denote either the interval (−∞, ∞) or the set Z = {0, ±1, ±2, .....},
ℑ+(resp.ℑ−) the nonnegative (resp.
nonpositive) subsets of ℑ.
We
can now write the continuous and discrete dynamical systems with the
notation T(t), t ∈ℑ+.
Deﬁnition 3 : (Dissipativeness). The semigroup T(t), t ∈ℑ+ is said
to be point dissipative (resp. compact dissipative) (resp. bounded dis-
sipative) if there is a bounded set B in X such that, for any ϕ ∈X
(resp. compact set K in X) (resp. bounded set U in X), there is a
t0 = t0(B, ϕ) ∈ℑ+(resp. t0 = t0(B, K)) (resp. t0 = t0(B, U)) such that
T(t)ϕ ∈B (resp. T(t)K ⊂B) (resp. T(t)U ⊂B) for t ≥t0, t ∈ℑ+.
As remarked earlier, point dissipativeness was introduced by Levin-
son (1944).
In ﬁnite dimensional space, all of the above concepts of
dissipativeness are the same.
Deﬁnition 4 : Maximal compact invariant set A set A ⊂X is said to
be the maximal compact invariant set for the dynamical system T(t), t ∈
G+, if it is compact invariant and maximal with respect to this property.
Deﬁnition 5 : Compact global attractor A set A ⊂X is said to be the
compact global attractor if it is compact invariant and for any bounded
set B ⊂X, we have
lim
t∈G+,t→∞dist(T(t)B, A) = 0.
For ODE in Rn, Pliss (1966) proved that point dissipativeness im-
plied the existence of a compact global attractor. Using this fact and an
asymptotic ﬁxed point theorem of Browder (1959) for completely con-
tinuous maps, he was able to prove that a dissipaative nonautonomous
ODE which is τ-periodic in thas a τ-periodic solution; thus, answer-
ing in the aﬃrmative the problem of Levinson (1944). For RFDE with

22
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
the period τ greater than the delay, Jones (1965) and Yoshizawa (1966)
used the same asymptotic ﬁxed point theorem to prove the existence
of a τ-periodic solution.
Recall that τ greater than the delay makes
the Poincar´e map completely continuous. In the interval [0, r], it is not
completely continuous, but we have seen above that it is the sum of
a contraction and a completely continuous operator. We give an ab-
stract ﬁxed point theorem later which will allow us to conclude that
the Poincar´e map has a ﬁxed point and, therefore, there is a τ-periodic
solution, which generalizes the result of Pliss (1966) to RFDE.
In a fundamental paper, Billoti and LaSalle (1971) proved the exis-
tence of a compact 2global attractor if T(t), t ∈ℑ+ is point dissipative
and there is a t1 ∈ℑfor which T(t1) is completely continuous. In the
discrete case, this implied that there is a periodic point of period t1.
Hale, LaSalle and Slemrod (1973) extended these results to the class
of asymptotically smooth dynamical systems deﬁned below. This class of
dynamical systems includes NFDE with an exponentially stable D0 op-
erator as well as many other dynamical systems, including those deﬁned
by many dissipative partial diﬀerential equations.
Deﬁnition 6 : (Asymptotically smooth) A dynamical system T(t), t ∈
ℑ+, on a Banach space X is said to be asymptotically smooth if, for any
bounded set B in X for which T(t)B ⊂B for t ∈ℑ+, there is a compact
set J in X such that
lim
t∈G+,t→∞dist(T(t)B, J) = 0.
This deﬁnition stated in a diﬀerent but equivalent way is due to Hale,
LaSalle and Slemrod (1973). It is very important to note that a dynam-
ical system can be asymptotically smooth and there can be a bounded
set for which the positive orbit is unbounded; for example, the dynam-
ical system deﬁned by the ODE x′ = x. The deﬁnition contains the
conditional expression ‘if T(t)B ⊂B, t ∈ℑ+.’
Proposition 2 :. If T(t), t ∈ℑ+, is asymptotically smooth and B is
a bounded set for which there is a t1 ∈ℑ+ such that γ+(T(t1)B) is
bounded, then ω(B) is a compact invariant set. It is connected for con-
tinuous dynamical systems if B is connected.
It is obvious that, if there is a t1 ∈ℑ+, t1 > 0 such that T(t1) is
completely continuous, then T(t), t ∈ℑ+, is asymptotically smooth. it
also is not diﬃcult to prove that, if T(t) = S(t) + U(t) where U(t) is
completely continuous for all t ∈ℑ+, and S(t) is a linear semigroup with
spectral radius α(t) →0 as t →∞, then T(t), t ∈ℑ+, is asymptotically
smooth.

History Of Delay Equations
23
In particular, the semigroup associated with RFDE and NFDE with
D0 exponentially stable are asymptotically smooth. For similar equa-
tions with τ-periodicity in time, the Poincar´e map is asymptotically
smooth.
The following result is essentially due to Hale, LaSalle and Slemrod
(1973) with some minor reﬁnements in its statement.
Theorem 8 : For the dynamical system T(t), t ∈ℑ+, if there is a
nonempty compact set K that attracts compact sets of X and A =
∩
t∈ℑ+T(t)K, then A is independent of K and
i) A is the maximal, compact, invariant set,
ii) A is connected if X is a Banach space.
iii) A is stable and attracts compact sets of X.
iv) For any compact set K, there is a neighborhood UK of K and a
t0 = t0(K) such that γ+(T(t0)UK)is bounded.
If, in addition, the dynamical system is asymptotically smooth, then
v) A is also a local attractor.
vi) If C is any subset of X for which there is a t0 = t0(C) such that
γ+(T(t0)C) is bounded, then A attracts C.
vii) In particular, if, for any bounded set B in X, there is a t0 = t0(B)
such that γ+(T(t0)B) is bounded, then A is the compact global attractor.
We also can state the following result.
Theorem 9 : A dynamical system T(t), t ∈ℑ+, on X has a compact
global attractor if and only if
i) T(t), t ∈ℑ+, is asymptotically smooth.
ii) T(t), t ∈ℑ+, is point dissipative.
iii) For any bounded set B in X, there is an t0 = t0(B) such that
γ+(T(t0)B) is bounded.
The suﬃciency is proved in the following way.
From (i) and (iii),
ω(B) is a compact invariant set which attracts B for any bounded set
B. Since (ii) is satisﬁed, it follows that the compact invariant set which
is the ω−limit set of the bounded set in the deﬁnition of point dissipative
attracts each compact set of X. Theorem 16 implies the existence of the
compact global attractor. Conversely, if the compact global attractor
exists, then we must have (ii) and (iii) satisﬁed.
Furthermore, if B
is a bounded set such that T(t)B ⊂B, t ∈G+, then ω(B) must be
compact and attract B, which implies that the dynamical system is
asymptotically smooth.
Cholewa and Hale (2000) have shown that there is an asymptotically
smooth dynamical system and a bounded set B for which ω(B) is com-
pact and invariant and yet γ+(B) is unbounded.

24
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
This shows that (iii) in Theorem 17 cannot be replaced by γ+(B)
bounded for each bounded set B.
If the compact global attractor exists, then the most interesting part
of the ﬂow deﬁned by the dynamical system occurs on the attractor even
though the transient behavior to a neighborhood of the attractor can be
very important in a speciﬁc application. There are examples of FDE for
which the ﬂow on the attractor can be very complicated and the attractor
itself is not a manifold. In spite of this, we have the following surprising
result of Maln´e (1981) (for the ﬁrst part for ﬁnite Hausdorﬀdimension
and X a Hilbert space, the result is due to Mallet-Paret (1976)) (for a
complete proof, see Hale, Magalhaes and Oliva (2002)).
Theorem 10 : Suppose that the dynamical system T(t), t ≥G¸ , on a
Banach space X has a compact invariant set A and has the property that
the derivative of T(t)ϕ with respect to ϕ is the sum of a contraction and
a completely continuous operator for each t > 0 and ϕ ∈A. Then
(1) The attractor A has ﬁnite capacity c(A).
(2) If S is a linear subspace of X with dimension ≥2c(A)+1, then there
is a residual set of the set of all continuous projections on Son which the
projection of the ﬂow onto S is one-to-one.
The ﬁrst part of the theorem implies that the Hausdorﬀdimension of
A is ﬁnite dimension and the second part says that A generically can
be embedded into ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of X if the dimension is
suﬃciently large.
We remark that, if the dynamical system has a maximal compact
invariant set (in particular, if there is the compact global attractor),
then the above properties hold for this set.
8.
Stationary points of dissipative ﬂows
As we have remarked earlier, it was of interest to determine the ex-
istence of ﬁxed points for the Poincar´e map associated with nonau-
tonomous FDE with τ-periodic dependence on t.
As a consequence,
of some results which will be stated below, we can state the following
result (see Hale and Lopes (1973)).
Theorem 11 : 1) If an autonomous RFDE or NFDE with D0 expo-
nentially stable is point dissipative, then there is an equilibrium point.
2) If a nonautonomous RFDE or NFDE with periodic coeﬃcients and
D0 exponentially stable is point dissipative, then there is a ﬁxed point of
the Poincar´e map.
There is an example of Jones and Yorke (1969) in R3 of an ODE for
which all solutions are bounded and yet there is no equilibrium point.

History Of Delay Equations
25
This says that some type of dissipation is necessary to obtain the con-
clusion in (0.1). Notice that part (2) has no restriction on the delay as in
the results mentioned previously of Jones (1965) and Yoshizawa (1966).
We now describe the asymptotic ﬁxed point theorem that is used to
prove the above result. We remark that the motivation for this ﬁxed
point theorem came form the above problem.
Suppose that X is a Banach space. The Kuratowski measure α(B) of
noncompactness of a bounded set B in X is deﬁned by
α(B) = inf{d : B has a ﬁnite cover of diameter < d}.
A map T : X →X is said to be an α-contraction if there is a constant
k ∈[0, 1) such that, for any bounded set B in X, we have α(TB)≤kα(B).
The following result was discovered independently and with diﬀerent
proofs by Nussbaum (1972), Hale and Lopes (1973).
Theorem 12 : If X is a Banach space and T : X →X is an α-
contraction which is compact dissipative, then there is a ﬁxed point of
T.
We need a few remarks to see why Theorem 19 is a consequence of
Theorem 20. In Theorem 19, it is assumed only that the Poincar´e is
point dissiaptive and in Theorem 20, compact dissipative is assumed.
We have remarked earlier that point dissipative for RFDE implies the
existence of the commpact global attractor and, therefore, the system
must be compact dissipative. For NFDE with an exponentially stable D0
operator, Massatt (1983) proved that point dissipativeness is equivalent
to compact dissipativeness. The proof is nontrivial and uses dissipative-
ness in two spaces.
It is not known if point dissipative is equivalent to compact dissipative
for α-contractiing maps.
Final Remarks We have only touched upon a few of the topics in
FDE due to limited space. However, the results presented set the stage
for much research in the last 35 years - especially, the development of
the qualitative theory, stability of the ﬂow on the attractor with respect
to the vector ﬁeld as well as detailed investigation of the ﬂow on the
attractor for speciﬁc types of equations that occur frequently in the
applications.
We can only refer to the reader to the books of Diekmann, van Gils,
Lunel and Walther (1991), Hale and Lunel (1993), Kolmanovski and

(1996) for partial diﬀerential equations with delay, Hino, Murakami and
Naito (1991), Hino, Naito, Minh and Shin (2002) for RFDE with inﬁnite
delay and the lectures on abstract evolutionary functional diﬀerential
equations at this workshop.

Introduction
In applications, the future behavior of many phenomena are assumed
to be described by the solutions of an ordinary diﬀerential equation.
Implicit in this assumption is that the future behavior is uniquely de-
termined by the present and independent of the past.
In diﬀerential
diﬀerence equations, or more generally functional diﬀerential equations,
the past exerts its inﬂuence in a signiﬁcant manner upon the future.
Many models are better represented by functional diﬀerential equations,
than by ordinary diﬀerential equations.
Example 1 A retarded functional diﬀerential equation. Imagine a bio-
logical population composed of adult and juvenile individuals. Let N(t)
denote the density of adults at time t. Assume that the length of the
juvenile period is exactly h units of time for each individual. Assume
that adults produce oﬀspring at a per capita rate α and that their proba-
bility per unit of time of dying is µ. Assume that a newborn survives the
juvenile period with probability ρ and put t = αρ. Then the dynamics of
N can be described by the diﬀerential equation
dN
dt (t) = −µN(t) + rN(t −h)
(1.1)
which involves a nonlocal term, rN(t−h) meaning that newborns become
adults with some delay. So the time variation of the population density
N involves the current as well as the past values of N. Such equations

are called Retarded Functional Diﬀerential Equations (RFDE) or, alter-
natively, Delay Equations.
Equation ( 1.1) describes the changes in N.
To determine a solution
past time t = 0, we need to prescribe the value of N at time −h, and we
can see that it is not enough to give the value at the point −h, since the
following example agree that this condition is not enough to determine
completely the solution.

(1.2)
coincide at t = 0.
In fact, all over the interval [0, h] we have the same problem: in order
to integrate the equation past some time t ∈[0, h], we need to prescribe
the value N(t −h). So we have to prescribe a function on an interval
of length h. The most convenient (though not the most natural from
a biological point of view) manner to do this is to prescribe N on the
interval [−h, 0] and then to use ( 1.1) for t ≥0. So we supplement ( 1.1)
by
N(θ) = ϕ(θ) for −h ≤θ ≤0
where ϕ is a given function. Explicitly, we then have for t ∈[0, h]
N(t) = ϕ(0) exp(−µt) + r
 t
0
exp(−µ(t −τ))ϕ(τ −h)dτ.
Using this expression we can give an expression for N on the interval
[h, 2h], etc.
Thus the method of steps and elementary theory of ordinary diﬀer-
ential equations provide us with a very simple existence and uniqueness
proof in this example.
Remarks 1) For any continuous function ϕ deﬁned on [−h, 0], there
is a unique solution x of (1.2) on [−h, ∞], denoted x(ϕ).
2) The solution x(ϕ) has a continuous time derivative for t > 0, but not
at t = 0 unless ϕ(θ) has a left hand derivative at θ = 0 and
dϕ
dt (0) = −µϕ(0) + rϕ(−h).
The solution x(ϕ) is smoother than the initial data.
3) For a given ϕ on [−h, 0], the solution x(ϕ)(t) of (1.2) need not be
deﬁned for t ≤−h. In fact, if x(ϕ)(t) is deﬁned for t ≤−h, say x(ϕ)(t)

is deﬁned for t ≥−h −ε, ε > 0, then ϕ(θ) must have a continuous ﬁrst
derivative for θ ∈]−ε, 0[.
A more general form of a delay diﬀerential equation is as follows:
dx
dt = F(t, x(t), x(t −r)).

A general initial value problem
Given r > 0, denote C ([a, b] , Rn), the Banach space of continuous
functions mapping the interval [a, b] into Rn with the topology of uniform
convergence. If [a, b] = [−r, 0], we let C = C ([−r, 0] , Rn) and designate
the norm of an element ϕ in C by |ϕ| =
sup
−r≤θ≤0
|ϕ(θ)|.
Let σ ∈R,
A > 0 and x ∈C ([σ −r, σ + A] , Rn), then for any t ∈[σ, σ + A], we let
xt ∈C, be deﬁned by
xt(θ) = x(t + θ), for −r ≤θ ≤0.
Let f: R×C →Rn be a given function. A functional diﬀerential equation
is given by the following relation
 dx
dt (t) = f(t, xt). for t ≥σ
and xσ = ϕ.
(2.3)
Deﬁnition 7 x is said to be a solution
of ( 2.3) if there are σ ∈R,
A > 0 such that x ∈C ([σ −r, σ + A] , Rn) and x satisﬁes ( 2.3) for
t ∈[σ, σ + A] . In such a case we say that x is a solution of ( 2.3) on
[σ −r, σ + A] for a given σ ∈R and a given ϕ ∈C we say that x =
x(σ, ϕ), is a solution of ( 2.3) with initial value at σ or simply a solution
of ( 2.3) through (σ, ϕ) if there is an A > 0 such that x(σ, ϕ) is a solution
of ( 2.3) on [σ −r, σ + A] and xσ(σ, ϕ) = ϕ.
Equation (2.3) is a very general type of equation and includes diﬀ-
erential-diﬀerence equations of the type
dx
dt (t) = f(t, x(t), x(t −r(t)))
for 0 ≤r(t) ≤r
as well as

If

in which L is linear in ϕ and (t, ϕ) →L(t, ϕ), we say that the equation
is a linear delay diﬀerential equation, it is called homogeneous if h ≡0.
If f(t, ϕ) = g(ϕ), equation (2.3) is an autonomous one.
Lemma 1 [12] Let σ ∈R and ϕ ∈C be given and f be continuous on
the product R × C. Then, ﬁnding a solution of equation ( 2.3) through
(σ, ϕ) is equivalent to solving:
x(t) = ϕ(0) +

t ≥σ and xσ = ϕ.
2.1
Existence
Lemma 2 [12] If x ∈C ([σ −r, σ + α] , Rn), then, xt is a continuous
function of t for t ∈[σ, σ + α] .
Proof. Since x is continuous on [σ −r, σ + α], it is uniformly contin-
uous and thus ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0, such that |x(t) −x(s)| < ε if |t −s| < δ.
Consequently for t, s in [σ, σ + α], |t −s| < δ, we have |x(t + θ)−
x(s + θ)| < ε, ∀θ ∈[−r, 0].
Theorem 1 [12] Let D be an open subset of R × C and f:D →Rn be
continuous. For any (σ, ϕ) ∈D, there exists a solution of equation ( 2.3)
through (σ, ϕ).
Proposition 3 If f is at most aﬃne i.e. |f(t, φ| ≤a |φ|+b with a, b > 0,
then there exists a global solution i.e. ∀ϕ, the solution x(σ, ϕ) is deﬁned
on [α, ∞[ .
Proof. Let ϕ ∈C, and assume that the solution is deﬁned only on
[α, β[. By integrating the equation (2.3), one has
x(t) = ϕ(0) +

f(s, xs)ds

and gives that the solution is uniformly continuous on [0, β[ and this
implies that lim
t→β |xt(., ϕ)| exists and is ﬁnite, note it xβ.
Let us consider the following delay diﬀerential equation
 dy
dt = f(t, yt) for t ≥β
yβ = xβ ∈C
this last equation has at least one solution on [β, β + ε] for some ε > 0,
and equation (2.3) has at least one solution deﬁned on [0, β + ε] , which
contradicts the maximality of the solution.
Corollary 2 If f is lipschitzian with respect to the second variable, then
it satisﬁes the property in the proposition below.
2.2
Uniqueness
Theorem 3 [12] Let D be an open subset of R × C and suppose that
f : D →Rn be continuous and f(t, ϕ) be lipschitzian with respect to ϕ
in every compact subset of D. If (σ, ϕ) ∈D, then equation ( 2.3) has a
unique solution passing through (σ, ϕ).
Proof. Consider Iα, Bβ as deﬁned in the proof of theorem . and
suppose x and y be two solutions of (2.3) on [σ −r, σ + α] with xσ =
ϕ = yσ. Then
x(t) −y(t) =
 t
σ(f(s, xs) −f(s, ys))ds.
t ≥σ
xσ −yσ = 0
Let k be the Lipschitz constant of f(t, ϕ) in a compact subset containing
the trajectories (t, xt) and (t, yt), t ∈Iα. Choose α such that kα < 1.
Then, for t ∈Iα one has:
|x(t) −y(t)| ≤
 t
σ
k |xs −ys| ds ≤kα sup
σ≤s≤t
|xs −ys| .
And this implies that x(t) = y(t) for t ∈Iα.
The uniqueness may not hold if the function is not locally lipschitzian.
For this, let us consider the following counterexamples:
1) There may be two distinct solutions of (2.3) deﬁned on (−∞, ∞)
and they coincide on (0, ∞) . The following example was given by A.

36
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Hausrath. Let r = 1, f(s) = 0, 0 ≤s ≤1, f(s) = −3 ( 3√s −1)2 , s > 1,
and consider the equation
dx
dt (t) = f (|xt|) .
The function x ≡0 is a solution of this equation on (−∞, ∞) . Also, the
function x(t) = −t3, t < 0, and x(t) =≡0, t ≥0, dx
dt (t) = −3t2. In fact,
since x ≤1 for t ≥−1, it is clear that x satisﬁes the equation for t ≥0.
Since x is monotone decreasing for t ≤0, |xt| = x(t−1) = −(t−1)3 and
dx
dt (t) = −3t2 It is easy to verify that
−3t2 = f((t −1)3)
for t < 0.
2)
d
dtx(t) = x(t −σ(x(t)))
(2.4)
where σ : R →[0, 1] is smooth, σ′(0) ̸= 0 and σ(0) = 1.
Note that the right hand side of (2.4) can be written as G(ϕ) =
ϕ(−σ(ϕ(0)) for ϕ ∈C([−1, 0] , R) and G is not locally lipschitz in a
neighborhood of zero . In fact assume that there exist positive constants
k and ρ such that
|G(ϕ1) −G(ϕ2)| ≤k |ϕ1 −ϕ2| for |ϕ1| , |ϕ2| < ρ
Let ϕ(θ) = ϵ(−1+
√
1 + θ), for θ ∈[−1, 0] , where ϵ is a positive constant
such that |ϕ| < ρ . Let x ∈[−1, 0] such that |ϕ| + |x| < ρ, then
|G(ϕ + x) −G(ϕ)| ≤k |x|
which implies
ϵ

1 −σ(x) + x
 ≤k |x| and

ϵ(σ(x) −1)
x

1 −σ(x)
 ≤(1 + k).
Letting x approaches zero, we obtain a contradiction.
Therefore the
right hand side of equation (2.4) is not locally lipschitz near zero. The
uniqueness has been proved for lipschitzian initial data ϕ, see [26] How-
ever , the standard argument for uniqueness can not be applied in this
example.
The equation

d
dtx(t) = −ax(t −σ(x(t)))

d

arrhythmias.

(2.5)
Then equation (2.5) has two solutions namely
x1(t) = t + t2
4 and x2(t) = t, for t ∈[0, 1] .
In fact one has t −x1(t) = −t2
4 . and t −x2(t) = 0, it follows that
x′
1(t) = 1 + t
2 = ϕ(t −x1(t)) and
x′
2(t) = 1 = ϕ(t −x2(t)) for t ∈[0, 1] .
2.3
Continuation of solutions
Deﬁnition 8 Suppose f in equation ( 2.3) is continuous. If x is a so-
lution of equation ( 2.3) on an interval [σ, a] , a > σ, we say x is a
continuation of x if there is a b > a such that x is deﬁned on [σ −r, b] ,
coincides with x on [σ −r, a] , and satisﬁes Equation ( 2.3) on [σ, b] . A
solution x is noncontinuable if no such continuation exists; that is the
interval [σ, a] is the maximal interval of existence of the solution x.
Theorem 4 Furthermore on the hypotheses of the precedent theorem,
if f is a bounded function, then equation ( 2.3) has a maximal solution
deﬁned on [−r, β[ with
if β < ∞=⇒lim
t→β |xt(., ϕ)| = ∞.

38
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Proof. By steps, we can integrate the equation (2.3), let [−r, β[ , be
the maximal interval on which x(., ϕ) is deﬁned.
Assume that
lim
t→β |xt(., ϕ)| < ∞then there exists N such that . |xt(., ϕ)| ≤N, ∀t ∈
[0, β[ , with dx
dt = f(t, xt) and from the boundedness of f, we have
sup
t∈[0,β[

dx
dt (t)
 < ∞,
then x is uniformly continuous on [0, β[ . So, lim
t→β |xt(., ϕ)| exists, which
we denote by xβ. Let ψ ∈C( [−r, β[ , Rn) deﬁned by ψ = xβ, under the
existence theorem, there exists ε > 0 such that the equation
 dy
dt = f(t, yt) for t ≥β
yβ = xβ ∈C
has at least one solution on [β, β + ε] , the recollement of x and y gives
a solution deﬁned on [α, β + ε] , which contradicts the maximality of x.
Theorem 5 [12]Suppose Ωbe an open set in R × C, f : Ω→Rn be
globally lipschitz and completely continuous: that is, f is continuous
and takes closed bounded sets of Ωinto bounded sets of Rn, and x is
a noncontinuable solution of equation ( 2.3) on [σ −r, b] . Then, for any
closed bounded set U in R×C, U in Ω, there is a tU such that (t, xt) /∈U
for tU ≤t < b.
We now consider the existence of solutions of (2.3) for all t ≥−r. The
following lemma is needed before we proceed in that direction.
2.4
Dependence on initial values and parameters
Theorem 6 Let D be an open subset of R×C and suppose that f : D →
Rn be continuous and f(t, ϕ) be lipschitzian with respect to ϕ in every
compact subset of D. If (σ, ϕ) ∈D, then, the application ϕ →xt(., ϕ) is
continuous lipschitz.
Proof. From the corollary 2 and the fact that f is lipschitzian with
respect to the second variable
|f(t, ϕ| ≤k |ϕ| + |f(t, 0).|
Let ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈C, and x(.,ϕ1), x(.,ϕ2) the associated solutions, one has

By the Gronwall’s lemma, one has
|x(t, ϕ1) −x(t, ϕ2)| ≤|ϕ1 −ϕ2| exp (kt)
We shall ﬁrst prove the following lemma, which will be used subse-
quently.
Lemma 3 [22] Let f ∈C (J × Cρ, Rn). For t ∈J and φ ∈Cρ, we put
G(t, r) = max
∥φ∥≤r ∥f(t, φ)∥.
Suppose that r∗(t, t0, 0) is the maximal solution of
du
dt = G(t, u(t))
through (t0, 0).Then, if x(t, t0, φ0) is any solution of
dx
dt (t) = f(t, xt)
with φ0 as an initial value at t = t0. Then, we have :
∥xt(t0, φ0) −φ0∥≤r∗(t, t0, 0)
on the common interval of existence of x(t, t0, φ0) and r∗(t, t0, 0).
Theorem 7 [22] Let f ∈C (J × Cρ, Rn) and for t ∈J, ϕ, φ ∈C1
∥f(t, ϕ) −f(t, φ)∥≤g(t, ∥ϕ −φ∥)
where g ∈C (J × [0, 2ρ] , R+). Assume that u(t) ≡0 is the only solution
of the scalar equation
du
dt = g(t, u(t))
through (t0, 0).
Suppose ﬁnally that the solutions u(t, t0, u0) through
every point (t0, u0) exist for t ≥t0 and are continuous with respect to
the initial values (t0, u0). Then, the solutions x(t0, φ0) of equation ( 2.3)
are unique and continuous with respect to the initial values (t0, φ0).
Using the arguments of the precedent theorems, we can prove the
following theorem on dependence on parameters. We merely state.

Theorem 8 [22]Let f ∈C (J × Cρ × Rm, Rn) and, for µ = µ0 let
x0(t) = x0(t0, φ0, µ0)(t) be a solution of
dx
dt (t) = f(t, xt, µ0),
with an initial function φ0 at t0 existing for t ≥t0 . Assume that
lim
µ→µ0 f(t, φ, µ) = f(t, φ, µ0)
uniformly in (t,φ),
and for t ∈J, ϕ, φ ∈C, µ ∈Rm
∥f(t, ϕ, µ) −f(t, φ, µ)∥≤k ∥ϕ −φ∥,
Then, ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that for every µ satisfying |µ −µ0| < δ (ε),
the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt (t) = f(t, xt, µ)
admits a unique solution x(t) = x(t0, φ0, µ)(t) deﬁned on some interval
[t0, t0 + a] such that ∥x(t) −x0(t)∥< ε for t ∈[t0, t0 + a].
2.5
Diﬀerentiability of solutions
In precedent section suﬃcient conditions were given to ensure that
the solution x(σ, ϕ, f) on a (2.3) depends continuously on (σ, ϕ, f). In
this section some results are given on the diﬀerentiability with respect
to (σ, ϕ, f).
If Ωis an open set in R × C, let Cp(Ω, Rn), p ≥0 designate the space
of functions taking Ωinto Rn that have bounded continuous derivatives
up through order p with respect to ϕ in Ω.
Theorem 9 [12]If f ∈Cp(Ω, Rn), p ≥1, then the solution x(σ, ϕ, f) of
the ( 2.3) through (σ, ϕ)
is unique and continuously diﬀerentiable with
respect to (ϕ, f) for t in any compact set in the domain of deﬁnition of
x(σ, ϕ, f). Furthermore, for each t ≥σ, the derivative of x with respect to
ϕ, Dϕx(σ, ϕ, f)(t) is a linear operator from C to Rn, Dϕx(σ, ϕ, f)(σ) =
I, the identity, and Dϕx(σ, ϕ, f)ψ(t) for each ψ in C satisﬁes the linear
variational equation
y′(t) = Dϕf(t, xt(σ, ϕ, f)yt.
(2.6)
Also, for each t ≥σ, Dfx(σ, ϕ, f)(t) is a linear operator from Cp(Ω, Rn)
into Rn, Dfx(σ, ϕ, f)(σ) = 0, and Dfx(σ, ϕ, f)g(t) for each g in Cp
(Ω, Rn) satisﬁes the nonhomogeneous variation equation
z′(t) = Dϕf(t, xt(σ, ϕ, f)zt + g(t, xt(σ, ϕ, f)).

η is left-hand continuous on (−r, 0).

Existence and uniqueness of solutions
In this section we consider existence and uniqueness of solutions for
the problems (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), (1.4). We ﬁrst prove some estimates
which will be useful later.
Lemma 1.1 Let x(t) = x(t; φ, f) be a solution of (1.3), (1.4) on [0, ∞).
Then we have the estimate

estimates
|x(t + θ)| ≤|φ(0)| + ℓ

Therefore we have

The estimate (1.8) now follows from Gronwall’s inequality.
Uniqueness of solutions is an immediate consequence of Lemma 1.1.

Proposition 1.2 For any φ ∈C and any f ∈L1
loc(0, ∞; Cn) there exists
exactly one solution of problem (1.3), (1.4) on [0, ∞).
Proof. A continuous function [−r, ∞) →Cn is a solution of (1.3), (1.4)
if and only if the restriction of x to any interval [0, T], T > 0, is a ﬁxed
point of the operator TT deﬁned by

the function ˜y is deﬁned by ˜y(t) = φ(t) for −r ≤t ≤0 and ˜y(t) = y(t)
for 0 < t ≤T.
We choose a negative constant γ < −ℓand supply
C0(0, T; Cn) with the equivalent norm
∥y∥γ = sup

y ∈C0(0, T; Cn).
It is clear that TT C0(0, T; Cn) ⊂C0(0, T; Cn). For y, z ∈C0(0, T; Cn)

By choice of γ we have 0 < −ℓ/γ < 1, i.e., TT is a contraction on
C0(0, T; Cn). Let y(·, T) be the unique ﬁxed point of TT on C0(0, T; Cn).
It is clear that there exists exactly one function x : [−r, ∞) →Cn such
that x(t) = φ(t) for −r ≤t ≤0 and x(t) = y(t, T) for 0 ≤t ≤T and
any T > 0.
Proposition 1.3 For any T > 0 the mapping σ : C × L1(0, T; Cn) →
C(0, T; C) deﬁned by σ(φ, f)(t) = xt(φ, f), 0 ≤t ≤T, is bounded and
linear.
Proof. Boundedness of σ is an obvious consequence of (1.8).

The Laplace-transform of solutions. The
fundamental matrix
Throughout this section we consider the homogenous problem (1.1),
(1.2). In this case inequality (1.8) implies
|x(t; φ)| ≤∥φ∥eℓt,

exists at least for Re λ > ℓ, the integral converging absolutely in this
half plane. Similarly inequality (1.9) together with equation (1.1) shows
that also ˙x(t) has a Laplace-transform at least in Re λ > ℓgiven by
λˆx(λ) −φ(0)1.
Taking Laplace-transforms on both sides of equation

Note that the elements of ∆(λ) and therefore also det ∆(λ) are entire
functions. The same is true for p(λ; φ). Therefore the zeros of det ∆(λ)
are isolated on C and consequently the elements of ∆−1(λ) only can
have poles in C. The Laplace-transform ˆx(λ) therefore is a meromorphic
function in C.
Theorem 1.5 ∆−1(λ) is the Laplace-transform for a function Y (t),
which is locally absolutely continuous on [0, ∞). The Laplace-integral
for Y (t) is absolutely convergent in some half plane Re λ > β. More-

Also the Laplace-integrals for hj(t), j = 1, 2, . . . , are absolutely conver-

Absolute convergence of the Laplace-

rest of the proof follows from standard results on Laplace-transforms of
convolutions (cf. Theorem A.7).
Proof of Theorem 1.5. In order to show that ∆−1(λ) is a Laplace-

By Lemma 1.6 each of the functions ˆh(λ)j is a Laplace-transform with

Interchanging the order of integration is justiﬁed by Fubini’s theorem,
because |h1| ∗|hj−1| = O(tj−1) as t →∞, which in turn is a con-

Setting

Therefore, we have convergence of the series (1.14) if we choose α0 > β.

the series being absolutely convergent. Moreover, the Laplace-integral
for H(t) is absolutely convergent for Re λ > β (note that α0 could be

get |hj+1(t)| ≤a(at)j/j!, j = 0, 1, . . . . This proves uniform convergence

The precise abscissa of absolute convergence for the Laplace-integral
of Y (t) will be determined later (see Theorem 1.21 and Deﬁnition 1.19).
We next relate Y (t) to equation (1.1).

˙Y (t) = L(Yt)
a.e. for t ≥0,
Y (0) = I
and
Y (t) = 0
for −r ≤t < 0.
(1.18)
Since the columns of Yt are in C for t ≥r, the function Y (t) is con-
tinuously diﬀerentiable for t ≥r and equation (1.18) holds everywhere
on [r, ∞).
Proof of Theorem 1.7. a) From the identity
I = ∆−1(λ)∆(λ) = ∆−1(λ) −∆−1(λ)ˆh(λ)

we get using Lemma 1.6 and Theorem 1.5

Since η is discontinuous on an at most countable set, we get the assertion

If Yi(t), i = 1, 2, are two solutions of (1.18), then the columns of
Y1(t)−Y2(t) are solutions of the homogeneous equation (1.1) with φ = 0.
Consequently we have Y1(t) ≡Y2(t).

function H(t). As before we get (1.16). We decided to use Theorem A.9
for the proof of Theorem 1.5, because this in addition provided us an
explicit representation of Y (t) in terms of the matrix η.

Deﬁnition 1.8 The matrix ∆(λ) and the function det ∆(λ) are called

Y (t) is called the fundamental matrix of

Smooth initial functions
In case of an ordinary linear autonomous diﬀerential equation the
derivatives of solutions are again solutions of the equation. This is in
general not true in case of functional diﬀerential equations. A solution
of (1.1) is continuously diﬀerentiable on [0, ∞), but not necessarily dif-
ferentiable at 0, even if the initial function is continously diﬀerentiable
on [−r, 0].
Theorem 1.9 Let x(t; φ) be a solution of equation (1.1). Then x(t; φ)
has a continuous derivative on [−r, ∞) if and only if
(i) φ ∈C1([−r, 0], Cn),
(ii) ˙φ(0) = L(φ).
Moreover, if conditions (i) and (ii) hold, then
˙x(t; φ) = x(t; ˙φ),

This shows that x(t; φ) has a continuous derivative on [0, ∞). On the
other hand relation (1.26) shows that
y(t) = x(t; ˙φ)
a.e. on [0, ∞).
Since solutions of equation (1.8) are continuous on [−r, ∞), this proves
that x(t; φ) has a continuous derivative on [−r, ∞) and
˙x(t; φ) = x(t; ˙φ),
t ≥−r.
Now suppose that ˙x(t; φ) exists on [−r, ∞) and is continuous. This
implies φ ∈C1([−r, 0], Rn), of course. By continuity of ˙x(t; φ) at t = 0
we get ˙φ(0) = ˙x(0−; φ) = ˙x(0+; φ) = L(φ).
Remarks.
1. Conditions (i) and (ii) characterize the domain of the
inﬁnitesimal generator A corresponding to the solution semigroup T(t),
t ≥0, associated with equation (1.1) (see Theorem 1.23).
2. Since Aφ = ˙φ for φ ∈dom A, relation (1.24) means
AT(t)φ = T(t)Aφ,
t ≥0, φ ∈dom A,
which is well known for C0-semigroups.

We next turn to the nonhomogeneous problem (1.3), (1.4). If is suﬃ-

Therefore the Laplace-transforms of x(t) = x(t; 0, f(·, t1)) and ˙x(t) ex-
ist, the Laplace-integrals converging absolutely for Re λ > ℓ. Taking
Laplace-transforms on both sides of equation (1.29) we get
ˆx(λ) = ∆−1(λ) ˆf(λ; t1),
(1.30)
where ˆf(λ; t1) =

x(t) =

Y (t −τ)f(τ; t1) dτ,
t ≥0.
Since x(t; 0, f(·, t1)) = x(t; 0, f) for 0 ≤t ≤t1 and t1 > 0 was arbitrary,
we have proved the following theorem:
Theorem 1.13 For any φ ∈C and f ∈L1
loc(0, ∞; Cn), the solution of
problem (1.3), (1.4) is given by
x(t; φ, f) = x(t; φ) +
 t
0
Y (t −τ)f(τ) dτ,
t ≥0.
(1.31)
Remark. Theorem 1.7, b) implies that, for any a ∈Cn, the function
x(t; a) = Y (t)a, t ≥−r, is the unique solution of
˙x(t) = L(xt)
a.e. on t ≥0,
x(0) = a
and
x(t) = 0
for −r ≤t < 0.
(1.32)
Therefore formula (1.28) can be viewed as the variation of constants
formula for the nonhomogeneous problem
˙x(t) = L(xt) + f(t)
a.e. on t ≥0,
x(0) = a
and
x(t) = 0
for −r ≤t < 0,
(1.33)
where a = φ(0) and f(t) = L(φt), t ≥0.
Formula (1.28) also shows that the solution x(t; φ) is the sum of two
functions. One is the solution of (1.32) with a = φ(0) and therefore is
inﬂuenced only by φ(0), the other is the solution of (1.33) with a = 0
and f(t) = L(φt) and depends only on the past history φ |[−r,0).
1.6
The Spectrum
As we have seen in Section 1.3 the Laplace-integral for any solution
x(t) = x(t; φ) of (1.1), (1.2) is absolutely convergent for Re λ > ℓ(see
Proposition 1.4). Therefore the complex inversion formula (cf. Theo-
rem A.10) is applicable for any γ > ℓand gives

We shall show in the next section that instead of taking γ > ℓin (1.34)
we can choose any γ > sup{Re λ | ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) has a pole at λ}. Since
the poles of ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) occur under the zeros of det ∆(λ), we shall
investigate ﬁrst the location of these zeros.
Deﬁnition 1.14 The set σ(L) = {λ ∈C | det ∆(λ) = 0} is called the
spectrum of equation (1.1) and ρ(L) = C \ σ(L) is the resolvent set
of equation (1.1).
We ﬁrst state some basic facts about σ(L):
Proposition 1.15 a) σ(L) is non-empty and all points of σ(L) are iso-
lated in C. If σ(L) is ﬁnite, then det ∆(λ) is a polynomial in λ of degree
n.
b) If λ0 ∈σ(L)is a zero of det ∆(λ) with multiplicity k0, then λ0 is pole
of some order κ0 for ∆−1(λ) (i.e., λ0 is pole of at least one element of
∆−1(λ) and κ0 is the maximal order occuring). Moreover, we have
0 < κ0 ≤k0.
c) There exists a constant ρ > 0 such that (see the shaded areas in
Figure 1)
σ(L) ⊂{λ | Re λ ≥0 and |λ| ≤ρ} ∪{λ | Re λ < 0 and |λ|ern Re λ ≤ρ}.

Autonomous Functional Diﬀerential Equations
61
Proof.
a) Since det ∆(λ) is an entire function, the elements of σ(L)
are isolated points and zeros of ﬁnite multiplicity. Let λ0 ∈σ(L) be
a zero of multiplicity k0. From ∆−1(λ) =
1
det ∆(λ)adj∆(λ) it is clear
that λ0 is a pole of order κ0 ≤k0, because the elements of adj∆(λ) are
entire functions. We have to prove that λ0 is indeed a pole for ∆−1(λ).
Suppose that ∆−1(λ) is holomorphic at λ0. Then this is also true for
det ∆−1(λ) and det ∆(λ) det ∆−1(λ).
This leads to the contradiction
0 = det ∆(λ0) det ∆−1(λ0) = limλ→λ0 det ∆(λ) det ∆−1(λ) = 1.
b) We may write
det ∆(λ) = λn + αn−1(λ)λn−1 + · · · + α1(λ)λ + α0(λ),
(1.35)
where each αk(λ) is a ﬁnite sum of products of at most n of the functions
 0
−reλθdηij(θ), i, j = 1, . . . , n. The estimate (1.11) therefore implies that
there exists a constant δ > 0 such that
|αk(λ)| ≤

δ
for Re λ ≥0,
e−rn Re λδ
for Re λ < 0,
(1.36)
k = 0, . . . , n −1. Therefore we have the estimates

k=1 ρ−k = 1/δ, then
| det ∆(λ)| > 0. If we set λ = µ + iν, µ, ν real, then we have

c) It remains to prove the result for ﬁnite σ(L). Suppose that σ(L) is
empty or ﬁnite. Using (1.36) and the representation (1.35) for det ∆(λ)
we get
| det ∆(λ)| ≤

|λ|n + · · · + |λ| + 1

ern|λ|
for λ ∈C, which shows that det ∆(λ) is a function of exponential type
(see Deﬁnition B.1).
Therefore the assumption on σ(L) implies (cf.
Theorem B.7)
det ∆(λ) = p(λ)eαλ,
where p(λ) is a polynomial of degree ≥0 and α ∈C. Taking absolute
values we get
eRe(αλ) = | det ∆(λ)|
|p(λ)|

This together with (1.36) implies

for Re λ ≥0 and |λ| suﬃciently large. With σ = arg α we choose λk =
keiζk where ζk = −σ + π/2 or ζk = −σ −π/2 such that Re(αλk) = 0
and Re λk ≥0. For k →∞we see that (1.37) is only possible if p(λ)
is a polynomial of degree n. Therefore σ(L) is not empty. Suppose α is
not real. Then (1.37), for λ = iω, ω real, gives
e−ω Im α ≤

The right-hand side of this inequality is bounded for |ω| ≥n0, n0 suﬃ-
ciently large, whereas the left-hand side is not. Thus α has to be real.
But (1.37) implies that
lim
ρ→∞eαρ =

|pn|,
where pn ̸= 0 is the coeﬃcient of λn in p(λ). Thus we have α = 0 and
pn = 1.
Deﬁne the matrix η0 = (η0

In view of Proposition 1.15, a), the question arises if det ∆(λ) = det(λI−
A0) provided σ(L) is ﬁnite.
We can prove this under an additional
assumption on η:

Autonomous Functional Diﬀerential Equations
63
Proposition 1.16 Assume that there exists a δ > 0 such that η0(θ) =
η0(−δ) for θ ∈[−δ, 0]. If σ(L) is ﬁnite, then
det ∆(λ) = det(λI −A0).
Proof. The coeﬃcients αj(λ) in (1.35) can be written as
αj(λ) = aj + βj(λ),
j = 0, . . . , n −1,
(1.38)
where the aj are the coeﬃcients of det(λI −A0) and the βj(λ) are ﬁnite
sums of ﬁnite products involving elements of A0 and of
 0

In each product at least one factor is of the form

(1.39)
From
q(λ) = βn−1(λ)λn−1 + · · · + β1(λ)λ + β0(λ) = det ∆(λ) −det(λI −A0)
we see that q(λ) is a polynomial of degree ≤n −1. On the other hand
the estimate (1.39) implies that, for a constant K > 0,
|q(ρ)| ≤Ke−ρδρn−1
for ρ ≥1.
This implies that q(λ) is the zero polynomial.
An immediate and important consequence of Proposition 1.15, c),
and the fact that σ(L) cannot have an accumulation point in C is the
following result:
Corollary 1.17 For any α ∈R the set
σ(L) ∩{λ ∈C | Re λ ≥α}
is ﬁnite.
We shall need the following estimates:
Lemma 1.18 Let α ∈R be given. Then the following is true:
a) There exist positive constants K = K(α) and β = β(α) such that
|∆−1(λ)| ≤K
|λ|
for |λ| ≥β and Re λ ≥α.
b) There exists a positive constant M = M(α) such that
|p(λ; φ)| ≤M∥φ∥
for Re λ ≥α and φ ∈C.

Consequently, φ →ˆx(λ; φ) = ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) deﬁnes a bounded linear
functional C →Cn for all λ ̸∈σ(L).
Proof.
a) The estimate (1.36) shows that for some constant σ0 =
σ0(α) > 0 we have |αk(λ)| ≤σ0 for Re λ ≥α and k = 0, . . . , n−1. Then
| det ∆(λ)| ≥|λ|n

for Re λ ≥α.
Therefore there is a constant β = β(σ0) such that
| det ∆(λ)| ≥1

for Re λ ≥α and |λ| ≥β.
From (1.11) we infer that there exists a constant K = K(α) such that
|adj∆(λ)| ≤K
2 |λ|n−1
for Re λ ≥α and |λ| ≥β.
Therefore we have
|∆−1(λ)| ≤K
|λ|
for Re λ ≥α and |λ| ≥β.
b) Indeed,
|p(λ; φ)| ≤∥φ∥+ ℓ∥e0(λ) ∗φ∥

is called the exponential type of the solution x(t; φ) of (1.1), (1.2).
The names for ωL and ωL,φ will be justiﬁed later (see Corollary 1.22).
It is clear that ωL,φ ≤ωL for all φ ∈C.

By (1.43) and (1.44) also

(γ) eλt∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) dλ exists and equals x(t; φ)
for t > 0. This proves (1.42).
In the proof concerning Y (t) we have to choose γ0 > β, where β is
the number appearing in Theorem 1.5.
We now are able to prove that the numbers ωL and ωL,φ determine
the exponential growth of Y (t) and x(t; φ), respectively.
Theorem 1.21 a) The number ωL is the smallest number such that for
any ε > 0 there exists a constant K = K(ε) ≥1 such that
|Y (t)| ≤Ke(ωL+ε)t
for t ≥0.
(1.45)
b) The number ωL,φ is the smallest number such that for any ε > 0
there exists a constant ˜K = ˜K(ε) ≥1 such that for any ψ ∈C with
ωL,ψ ≤ωL,φ
|x(t; ψ)| ≤˜K∥ψ∥e(ωL,φ+ε)t
for t ≥0.
(1.46)
There always exists a φ ∈C such that ωL,φ = ωL.
Proof.
Again we just prove b). We show ﬁrst that ωL,φ cannot be
replaced by a smaller number. Indeed, assume that (1.46) is true for
a γ < ωL,φ. Then, for ε = (ωL,φ −γ)/2 we have γ + ε < ωL,φ and
|x(t; φ)| ≤˜K(ε)∥φ∥e(γ+ε)t, t ≥0, which implies that the Laplace-integral
for x(t; φ) converges absolutely for Re λ > γ, a contradiction to the
deﬁnition of ωL,φ.
We now choose a ψ ∈C with ωL,ψ ≤ωL,φ. For ε > 0 we set ωL,φ+ε = γ
and get from (1.42)

serve that (λ −ωL,φ)−1ψ(0) is the Laplace-transform of eωL,φtψ(0) and
−(λ −ωL,φ)−1L(e0(λ) ∗ψ) is the Laplace-transform of the convolution
eωL,φt∗L(ψt) (see Lemma 1.10). All Laplace-integrals are converging ab-
solutely for Re λ > ωL,φ. For eωL,φt this is trivial and for the convolution
it is valid because it is true for both factors. Therefore we have

Since x(t; ψ) = I1 + I2, the desired result follows from (1.47) and (1.48).

An easy calculation shows that x(t) = eλ0tb is a nontrivial solution of
equation (1.1) if and only if det ∆(λ0) = 0 and b is a nonzero solution of
∆(λ0)b = 0. Therefore, for any λ0 ∈σ(L), we have at least one solution
whose exponential type is Re λ0 (note that L(eλ0t) = (λ −λ0)−1).
Corollary 1.22 We have

t ln |Y (t)| = ωL
and, for any φ ∈C,
lim sup

t ln |x(t; φ)| = ωL,φ.
The proof of this corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.21.
1.7
The solution semigroup
For any t ≥0 we deﬁne the operator T(t) : C →C by
T(t)φ = xt(φ),
φ ∈C.
From Proposition 1.3 (for f ≡0) we see that T(t) is a bounded linear
operator. Since xt+s(φ) = xt(xs(φ)) for t, s ≥0, we also have
T(t + s) = T(t)T(s),
t, s ≥0,
i.e., the family T =

T(t)

t≥0 is a semigroup. Since x(t; φ) is uniformly
continuous on intervals [−r, T], T ≥−r, it is clear that
∥xt(φ) −φ∥=
sup
−r≤θ≤0
|x(t + θ; φ) −φ(θ)| →0
as t ↓0,
which proves that S is a C0-semigroup.
Theorem 1.23 a) The inﬁnitesimal generator A of S is given by
dom A = {φ ∈C1(−r, 0; Cn) | φ′(0) = L(φ)},
Aφ = φ′,
φ ∈dom A.
(1.49)
b) The spectrum σ(A) of A is all point spectrum and is given by
σ(A) = σ(L) = {λ ∈C | det ∆(λ) = 0}.
c) The resolvent operator of A is given by

The function ψλ is in C1(−r, 0; Cn). We have to choose ψλ(0) such that

This equation can be solved for ψλ(0) if and only if det ∆(λ) ̸= 0. In
this case we have
ψλ(0) = ∆(λ)−1p(λ; φ) = ˆx(λ; φ).
From Lemma 1.18, b) we see that φ →ψλ(0) deﬁnes a bounded linear
functional C →Cn.
This implies that φ →ψλ is a bounded linear
operator C →C. Therefore we have shown that λ ∈σ(A) if and only if
det ∆(λ) = 0. Moreover, λ ∈σ(A) implies that λI −A is not injective
((λI−A)ψ = 0, ψ ∈dom A, is equivalent to ψ(θ) = ψ(0)eλθ, −r ≤θ ≤0,
and ∆(λ)ψ(0) = 0). Thus parts b) and c) are proved.
It remains to prove that A is the inﬁnitesimal generator of T . For
the moment let B denote the inﬁnitesimal generator of T . Then we have

Since λ0 can be a pole of ˆx(λ; φ) of order at most κ0 (observe that

theorem.
Theorem 2.4 Let K(λ) be an n × n-matrix which is holomorphic in a

(iii) Mρ(λ), ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ, is an mρ × mρ-matrix, which is holomorphic
in U with det Mρ(λ) ̸= 0 in U,
(iv) the numbers ℓ, mρ, dρ are uniquely determined by properties (i) –
(iii).
Proof. The power series expansion of K(λ) around 0 has the following
form:
K(λ) = λn1H(λ),
H0 ̸= 0, n1 ≥0,
where H(λ) = ∞
j=0 λjHj.
Case 1.
Assume that det H0 ̸= 0. In this case we have F(λ) ≡G(λ) ≡I, ℓ= 1,
d1 = n1, m1 = n, because
K(λ) = λn1H(λ)
satisﬁes already (i)–(iii).
Case 2.
Assume that det H0 = 0. Let m1 = rank H0. From H0 ̸= 0 and det H0 =

0 < m1 < n.

If det H(2)

and proceed as above in Case 2.
In a ﬁnite number of steps we arrive at M(λ) as given in the theorem.
It remains to prove (iv). In order to do this we have to introduce the
notion of determinantal divisors for a holomorphic matrix.
For an n × n-matrix N(λ) which is holomorphic in a neighborhood U
of zero we introduce the numbers βν(N), ν = 1, . . . , n, as follows:
(i) Any ν × ν-minor of N(λ) has the form
λβν(N)q(λ),
λ ∈U,
where q(λ) is holomorphic in U.
(ii) There exists at least one ν × ν-minor of N(λ) such that q(0) ̸= 0.
Since a (ν + 1) × (ν + 1)-minor is a linear combination of ν × ν-minors
(Laplace expansion theorem for determinants), we have
βν+1(N) ≥βν(N),
ν = 1, . . . , n −1.
The following lemma shows that equivalence transformations of the
form appearing in Theorem 2.4 leave the numbers βν invariant.

ν = 1, . . . , n.
Proof. If K

βν(K) ≥βν(M).
Proof for (iv) of Theorem 2.4. From Lemma 2.5 we conclude that

From this it is clear that the numbers mρ, dρ are uniquely determined
by the numbers β1, . . . , βn. Indeed, we have to proceed as follows:
Step 1.
Given β1, . . . , βn, compute the sequence
β2 −β1 ≤β3 −β2 ≤· · · ≤βn −βn−1.
The numbers m1, . . . , mℓ−1 are those indices, where a strict inequality
occurs in this sequence,
βmρ+1 −βmρ > βmρ −βmρ−1,
ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ−1
(the number of strict inequalities in the above sequence is ℓ−1). The
number mℓis given by n −ℓ−1
ρ=1 mρ.
Step 2.
The numbers dρ are given by (m0 := 0)
dρ = βk −βk−1,
k = mρ−1 + 1, . . . , mρ,
ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ−1,
dℓ= βk −βk−1,
k = mℓ−1 + 1, . . . , n.
Since the numbers ℓ, dρ, mρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ, are uniquely determined
by β1, . . . , βn, which in turn are uniquely determined by the equivalence
class of K(λ) (with respect to equivalence transforms satisfying (ii) of
Theorem 2.4), we have proved (iv).
Remark. The polynomials δν(λ) := λβν, ν = 1, . . . , n, are called the
determinantal divisors of K(λ) at λ = 0, whereas the polynomials
ε1(λ) ≡1,
εν(λ) = λβν−βν−1,
ν = 2, . . . , n,
are the elementary divisors of K(λ) at λ = 0. From the relations
between the numbers βν we conclude that
δν | δν+1
and
εν | εν+1,
ν = 1, . . . , n −1.

(ii) ˜Hk(λ0) = ˜Fk(λ0) ˜Gk(λ0) for all k = 1, 2, . . . .
Proof. The proof is obvious if we compute the Laurent series expansions
on both sides of H(λ) = F(λ)G(λ) around λ0. One also has to observe
that the coeﬃcient matrix of λ−µ+j−1 is the block appearing in the j-th
diagonal of ˜Fk(λ0) etc.
For the proof of Theorem 2.4 we only need Lemma 2.6 for µ = ν = 0.
Note that in this case

The general form of Lemma 2.6 will be needed below.
We now compute rank ˜Bk(λ0) in several steps. Let M(λ) be the matrix
obtained from B(λ) according to Theorem 2.4 (with λ replaced by λ−λ0
of course). Then according to Lemma 2.6 we have

The latter equation follows from the special form of M(λ). Furthermore,

Remarks. 1. That dim Pλ0 = k0 was ﬁrst proved in [24]. The presen-

holomorphic matrices see [14].
2. The results presented above are true whenever Proposition 2.1 is true
and λ0 is a zero of ﬁnite multiplicity of det ∆(λ).
The results of this section can also be interpreted for the solution
semigroup T and its inﬁnitesimal generator A.
Theorem 2.10 Let ψ ∈C and λ0 ∈σ(A) be given.
a) The following statements are equivalent:
(i) ψ ∈range(A −λ0I)k.
(ii) The equation
˜∆k(λ0)˜bk = −˜pk(λ0; ψ) = −col

(2.4)

(iii) There exist vectors b0, . . . , bk−1 ∈Cn such that the function

(2.5)
is in dom Ak (for the deﬁnition of ej see (1.10)).
b) If ψ ∈range(A −λ0I)k, then ψ = (A −λ0I)kφ for any φ which is
given by (2.5), where ˜bk = col(b0, . . . , bk−1) is a solution of (2.4).
Proof. An easy calculation shows that for φ given by (2.5) we have
˙φ −λ0φ =

From (2.6) we get ˙φ(0) = λ0b0 + b1. Therefore we have φ ∈dom A if
and only if
k−1

j=0

j!∆(j)(λ0)bj = −pk−1(λ0; ψ).

In this case equation (2.6) just means

Analogously we see that (A −λ0I)φ ∈dom A if and only if

j!∆(j)(λ0)bj+1 = −pk−2(λ0; ψ).
(2.8)

(2.9)
Moreover, we have
χ := (A −λ0I)k−1φ = e0(λ0)bk−1 + e0(λ0) ∗ψ.
For χ we get ˙χ = λ0χ+ψ, ˙χ(0) = λ0bk−1+ψ(0) and L(χ) = −∆(λ0)bk−1+
λ0bk−1 −p0(λ0; ψ) + ψ(0).
Therefore χ is in dom A if and only if
∆(λ0)bk−1 = −p0(λ0; ψ). This proves φ ∈dom Ak if and only if (2.9)
holds also for i = k−1, i.e., if and only if (2.4) is satisﬁed. Moreover, we

84

have (A −λ0I)χ = (A −λ0I)kφ in this case. Thus we have established
that (iii) is equivalent to (ii) and that (iii) implies (i).
Assume that ψ ∈range(A −λ0I)k, i.e., ψ = (A −λ0I)kφ for some
φ ∈dom Ak. Then φ is solution of the diﬀerential equation
 d

kφ = ψ.
This implies that φ is given by (2.5). Since φ ∈dom Ak, the vector ˜bk
solves (2.4). This proves that (i) implies (iii).
Corollary 2.11 Let φ ∈C and λ0 ∈σ(A) be given. Then we have
φ ∈ker(A −λ0I)k
if and only if
φ =

j=0
ej(λ0)bj
with ˜∆k(λ0)˜bk = 0.
Proof. The result follows immediately from Theorem 2.10, b), for ψ =
0.
The proof of Proposition 2.3, b), for general k, shows that dim ker(A−
λ0I)k = dim ker ˜∆k(λ0). Therefore Corollary 2.9 gives also the dimen-
sion of ker(A −λ0I)k, k = 1, 2, . . . . From Proposition 2.3 we see that
Pλ0 = ker(A −λ0I)k,
k = κ0, κ0 + 1, . . . .
(2.10)
We call a subspace Z of Pλ0 cyclic with respect to A, if there exists
a basis φ0, . . . , φk−1 of Z (k = dim Z) such that
Aφ0 = λ0φ0,
Aφj = λ0φj + φj−1,
j = 1, . . . , k −1.
From the results given above it is possible to determine the decomposi-
tion of Pλ0 into a direct sum of subspaces cyclic with respect to A.
Theorem 2.12 Let λ0 ∈σ(L) and let ℓ, dρ and mρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ, be the

By deﬁnition of the φ(ℓ)

In the next step we observe

Continuing in this way we see that α(ρ)
j,i = 0 for ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ, j =

proves that dim Zρ,j = dρ.
Of special interest are the extreme cases, i.e., all cyclic subspaces of
Pλ0 are of dimension one resp. Pλ0 itself is cyclic.
Proposition 2.13 Let k0 be the multiplicity of λ0 as a root of det ∆(λ).
a) The following statements are equivalent:
(1) All subspaces cyclic with respect to A of Pλ0 are one-dimensional.
(2) One of the following two conditions is satisﬁed:
(i) k0 < n and rank ∆′(λ0) = n −k0.
(ii) k0 = n, ∆(λ0) = 0 and rank ∆′(λ0) = n.
(3) κ0 = 1 (κ0 is the order of the pole of ∆−1(λ) at λ0).
b) The following statements are equivalent:
(1) Pλ0 is cyclic with respect to A.
(2) We have
rank ∆(λ0) = n −1.
(2.12)
(3) κ0 = k0.

Proof.
a) All cyclic subspaces to be of dimension 1 is equivalent to
dρ ≤1 for all ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ. In view of 0 ≤d1 < d2 < · · · < dℓthis is
equivalent to either
(i′) ℓ= 2
and
d1 = 0, d2 = 1,
or
(ii′) ℓ= 1
and
d1 = 1.
In case of (i′) the matrix M(λ) in Theorem 2.4 is given by M(λ) =
diag

M1(λ), (λ −λ0)M2(λ)

. From m1d1 + m2d2 = k0 and m1 + m2 = n
we immediately get m2 = k0 and m1 = n −k0. Therefore condition (i′)
implies condition (i), because k0 < n and rank ∆(λ0) = rank M(λ0) =
m1 = n −k0 in this case.
If on the other hand (i) is true, then the numbers βk deﬁned in the
proof of Theorem 2.4 are given by
β1 = · · · = βk0 = 0,
βk0+1 ≥1
and
βn = k0.
This shows m1 = k0 and d1 = 0.
Since βm1 < · · · < βn (observe
0 ≤d1 < d2 · · · < dℓ), we must have
βn−k0+i = i,
i = 1, . . . , n.
This implies ℓ= 2, m2 = n −k0 and d2 = 1, i.e., (i′) holds.
In case of (ii′) the matrix M(λ) is given by M(λ) = (λ −λ0)M1(λ)
which shows that k0 = n, M(λ0) = 0 and rank M1(λ0) = n.
From
M(λ0) = F(λ0)∆(λ0)G(λ0) we get that also ∆(λ0) = 0. But then we
have ∆(λ) = (λ −λ0)∆1(λ). Observing ∆1(λ0) = ∆′(λ0) and M1(λ0) =
F(λ0)∆′(λ0)G(λ0) we see that rank ∆′(λ0) = n. Thus we have shown
that (ii′) implies (ii).
If on the other hand (ii) is true, then βn = n because of rank ∆′(λ0) =
n and d1 > 0 because of ∆(λ0) = 0. In this case we have β1 < · · · < βn,
which together with βn = n implies
βi = i,
i = 1, . . . , n.
This shows ℓ= 1 and d1 = 1, i.e., (ii′) holds.
Since κ0 = dℓ(see Theorem 2.8), conditions (i′) or (ii′) imply κ0 = 1.
If on the other hand κ0 = 1, then dℓ= 1, which implies either ℓ= 1,
d1 = 1, i.e., (ii′), or ℓ= 2, d1 = 0 and d2 = 1, i.e., (i′).
b) Pλ0 is cyclic if and only if
mℓ= 1
and
dℓ= k0 (= dim Pλ0).
(2.13)

This implies ℓ−1
ρ=1 mρdρ = 0 which is equivalent to either ℓ= 1 or ℓ= 2
and d1 = 0. In the ﬁrst case we have n = m1 = 1, i.e., ∆(λ) is scalar
with ∆(λ0) = 0. In the second case we get m1 = n −m2 = n −1. In
both cases we have rank M(λ0) = rank ∆(λ0) = n −1.
Suppose conversely that rank ∆(λ0) = n −1. For n = 1 this means
β1 = βn > 0 and consequently ℓ= 1, m1 = 1 and d1 = k0 (observe
k0 = m1d1 in this case). For n > 1 we get
β1 = · · · = βn−1 = 0
and
βn = k0.
This implies ℓ= 2, m1 = n −1, d1 = 0, m2 = 1 and d2 = k0.
If (2.13) holds, then κ0 = dℓ= k0. If conversely κ0 = k0, then dℓ= k0.
This and ℓ
ρ=1 mρdρ = k0 imply mℓ= 1, i.e., (2.13) holds.

Proposition 2.14 If λ0 is a root of multiplicity k0 of det ∆(λ) as given
in (2.15) then equation (2.14) has at least one solution
y(t) = p(t)eλ0t,
t ∈R,
where p(t) is a polynomial of degree k0 −1.
Proof.
Obviously we have rank ∆(λ0) = n −1 for any zero λ0 of
det ∆(λ0). According to Proposition 2.13, b) we have κ0 = k0. Therefore
the equation ˜∆k0(λ0)˜bk0 = 0 has a solution ˜bk0 = col(b0, . . . , bk0−1) with
bk0−1 ̸= 0. Indeed, if bk0−1 = 0 for all solutions of this equation, then
all solutions of this equation satisfy ˜∆k(λ0)˜bk = 0 for some k < k0, i.e.,
Pλ0 = ker(A −λ0I)k for some k < k0 = κ0, a contradiction to (2.10).
The vector bk0−1 ̸= 0 satisﬁes ∆(λ0)bk0−1 = 0.
The special form of
the matrix ∆(λ0) implies that the ﬁrst component of bk0−1 is nonzero
(otherwise we would have bk0−1 = 0). Thus we have shown that the ﬁrst
component x1(t) of x(t) = eλ0t k0−1

Projections onto eigenspaces
In this sections we shall deﬁne continuous projections πλ0 : C →Pλ0,
λ0 ∈σ(L), such that C = range πλ0 ⊕ker πλ0 is a decomposition of C,
where the subspaces are invariant with respect to equation (1.1) (resp.
the solution semigroup T ). The following result will give the motivation
for the deﬁnition of πλ0.
Proposition 2.15 Let λ0 ∈σ(L) be given and assume that the function
g(λ) is holomorphic at λ0. Then the function
x(t) = Res
λ=λ0 eλt∆−1(λ)g(λ),

is an generalized eigenfunction of (1.1) corresponding to λ0 and the
function
θ →Res
λ=λ0 eλθ∆−1(λ)g(λ),
−r ≤θ ≤0,
is in Pλ0.
Proof. As usual let κ0 denote the order of the pole of ∆−1(λ) at λ0.
Then the function eλt∆−1(λ)g(λ) has at most a pole of order ≤κ0 at
λ0. From the expansions
∆−1(λ) =

t ≥−r,
where
cj = D−j−1g0 + · · · + D−κ0gκ0−j−1,

This can be written as
˜cκ0 = ˜Dκ0˜gκ0,
(2.16)
where ˜cκ0 = col(c0, . . . , cκ0−1) ∈Cnκ0, ˜gκ0 = col(gκ0−1, . . . , g0) ∈Cnκ0

Since we have ∆(λ)∆−1(λ) ≡I in a neighborhood of λ0, we get from
Lemma 2.6 (observe that the matrices appearing in the main and the
upper diagonals of ˜∆κ0 ˜Dκ0 are the coeﬃcient matrices of λ−κ0, . . . , λ−1
in the series expansion ∆(λ)∆−1(λ) ≡I around λ0 which are all zero,
of course)
˜∆κ0 ˜Dκ0 = 0.
(2.18)
This together with (2.16) implies
˜∆κ0˜cκ0 = 0,
which in view of Proposition 2.1 proves the result.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
If we take g(λ) = p(λ; φ), then ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is the Laplace-transform
of x(t; φ) (see Theorem 1.4, b)). We deﬁne πλ0 : C →Pλ0 by
πλ0φ = Res
λ=λ0 e0(λ)∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ),
φ ∈C.
This can also be written as
πλ0φ =

e0(λ)∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) dλ,
(2.19)
where Γ is any positively oriented circle around λ0 such that there is no
other element of σ(L) on Γ or in its interior.
Lemma 2.16 Let λ0 ∈σ(L) and φ ∈C be given. Then we have

πλ0xt(φ)

(θ) = Res
λ=λ0 eλ(t+θ)∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ),
−r ≤θ ≤0, t ≥0.
Proof. Fix t ≥0 and deﬁne y(s) = x(s; xt(φ)) = x(t + s; φ), s ≥0.
According to the deﬁnition of πλ0 we have

πλ0xt(φ)

(θ) = Res
λ=λ0 eλθ∆−1(λ)p(λ; xt(φ)),

λ=λ0 eλθ∆−1(λ)p(λ; xt(φ)) = Res
λ=λ0 eλ(t+θ)∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ),

For λ0 ∈σ(L), deﬁne the subspace Qλ0 by
Qλ0 = ker πλ0.
Theorem 2.17 Let λ0 ∈σ(L) be given.
a) πλ0 is a continuous projection C →Pλ0, i.e., π2
λ0 = πλ0 and range πλ0 =
Pλ0.
b) The subspace Pλ0 is invariant with respect to the solution semigroup
T in the sense that for any φ ∈Pλ0 the solution x(t; φ) can be extended

to (−∞, ∞) and xt(φ) ∈Pλ0 for t ∈R. The subspace Qλ0 is positively
invariant with respect to T . Moreover, we have
C = Pλ0 ⊕Qλ0.
(2.20)
c) The subspace Qλ0 is characterized as
Qλ0 = {φ ∈C | ˆx(λ) = ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is holomorphic at λ0}.
d) We have
Qλ0 = range(A −λ0I)k
for k = κ0, κ0 + 1, . . . ,
and range(A −λ0I)k ⫌Qλ0 for k = 0, . . . , κ0 −1.
Proof. a) It is obvious that πλ0 is linear. In order to prove boundedness
we ﬁx Γ in (2.19). By continuity of ∆−1(λ) on Γ there exists a constant
K > 0 such that
∥e0(λ)∆−1(λ)∥≤K
for λ ∈Γ.
From Lemma 1.18, b), we get, for a constant M > 0,
|p(λ; φ)| ≤M∥φ∥
for λ ∈Γ.
Therefore we have (ρ = radius of Γ)
∥πλ0φ∥≤2πρKM∥φ∥,
φ ∈C.
In order to prove range πλ0 = Pλ0 we choose a φ ∈Pλ0. φ is given as
φ = κ0−1
j=0 ej(λ0)bj. Then
ˆx(λ; φ) =

b) For φ ∈Pλ0, φ = κ0−1

This equation is also true for t < 0.
Fix t < 0 and deﬁne y(s) =

e−λτx(τ; φ) dτ + eλtˆx(λ; φ).
Since the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is entire, we get
Res
λ=λ0 eλθ∆−1(λ)p(λ; xt(φ)) = Res
λ=λ0 eλ(t+θ)∆−1p(λ; φ),
−r ≤θ ≤0.
Using this we get as in the case t ≥0 that πλ0xt(φ) = xt(φ).
In order to prove positive invariance of Qλ0 we use c), which is proved
below. Since ˆx(λ; φ) = ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) for φ ∈Qλ0 is holomorphic at λ0,
we get
Res
λ=λ0 eλ(t+θ)∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) = 0
for all t ≥0 and −r ≤θ ≤0.
This implies πλ0xt(φ) = 0 for all t ≥0, i.e., xt(φ) ∈Qλ0, t ≥0.
The representation (2.20) follows from C = range πλ0 ⊕range(I −πλ0).
c) If ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is holomorphic at λ0, then obviously πλ0φ = 0, i.e.,
φ ∈Qλ0. Assume now that ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) has a pole of order κ, 0 <
κ ≤κ0, at λ0. Then the Laurent series of ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is of the form
(λ −λ0)−κq−κ + (λ −λ0)−κ+1q−κ+1 + · · ·
with q−κ ̸= 0. This implies
πλ0φ = Res
λ=λ0 e0(λ)∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) = eκ−1(λ0)q−κ + · · · + e0(λ0)q−1 ̸≡0,

It is easy to see that φ ∈dom A implies that x(t; φ) is continuously

φ ∈dom Ak implies that x(t; φ) is k-times continuously diﬀerentiable on
[−r, ∞) and x(k)(t; φ) = x(t; φ(k)). Taking Laplace-transforms we get

If ψ ∈Qλ0, then q(λ) = ∆−1(λ)p(λ; ψ) is holomorphic at λ0. There-

this implies ψ ∈"∞

Remark.
The above result shows that the projection πλ0xt(φ, f) is
formally obtained from (1.28) and (1.31) by applying the projection πλ0
and observing that πλ0Yt = Dt, t ≥0. Furthermore, equation (2.27)
for f ≡0 allows to deﬁne the continuation of z(t) =

negative t.
Since Pλ0 is invariant with respect to the solution semigroup T and is
ﬁnite dimensional, the restriction of T to Pλ0 is generated by a bounded
linear operator, i.e., is the solution semigroup of an ordinary diﬀerential
equation, which we shall compute below.
Let ˜bν

Then we have Φλ0 = κ0−1
j=0 ej(λ0)Φj and ˜Φκ0 = col (Φ0, . . . , Φκ0−1).
For φ ∈Pλ0 let a ∈Ck0 be the coordinate vector of φ with respect to
the basis φ(1), . . . , φ(k0), i.e.,
φ = Φλ0a =

θ = 0). This implies cj = Φja, j = 0, . . . , κ0 −1, or equivalently
˜Φκ0a = ˜Dκ0 ˜pκ0.
(2.28)
Note that rank ˜Φκ0 = k0, so that (2.28) has a unique solution.
From Pλ0 = ker(A −λ0I)κ0 and (A −λ0I)κ0Aφ = (A −λ0I)κ0+1φ +

Exponential dichotomy of the state space
According to Corollary 1.17 the set
Λα = {λ ∈σ(L) | Re λ ≥α}
(2.31)
is ﬁnite for any α ∈R. Let λ1, . . . , λN be the elements in Λα and denote
by ki the multiplicity of λi, i = 1, . . . , N. We set

and, for φ ∈PΛα, y(t) ∈Ck1+···+kN by
xt(φ) = ΦΛαy(t),
t ∈R,
(2.33)
then y(t) solves
˙y(t) = BΛαy(t),
t ∈R,
ΦΛαy(0) = φ.
From Corollary 1.17 it also follows that there exists a γ > 0 such that
Re λ ≤α −2γ
for all λ ∈σ(L) \ Λα.
This implies (see Deﬁnition 1.19) that
ωL,φ ≤α −2γ
for all φ ∈QΛα.
Let φ ∈QΛα be such that ωL,φ = maxψ∈QΛα ωL,ψ. Then according to
Theorem 1.21, b) there exists a constant K = K(α, γ) ≥1 such that
|x(t; ψ)| ≤K∥ψ∥e(ωL,φ+γ)t ≤K∥ψ∥e(α−γ)t,
t ≥0, ψ ∈QΛα.
This implies (with ˜K = K max(1, e−(α−γ)r))
∥xt(ψ)∥≤˜K∥ψ∥e(α−γ)t,
ψ ∈QΛα, t ≥0.
The only eigenvalues of BΛα are λ1, . . . , λN. Therefore, for any γ > 0,
there exists a K1 ≥1 such that
|y(t)| ≤K1|y(0)|e(α−γ)t,
t ≤0,
(2.34)
where y(t) is deﬁned in (2.33). If we deﬁne the norm on Ck1+···+kN by
|z| = ∥Φαz∥, then (2.34) is equivalent to
∥xt(φ)∥≤K1∥φ∥e(α−γ)t,
φ ∈PΛα, t ≤0.
Thus we have proved the following theorem:
Theorem 2.21 For α ∈R let Λα and QΛα, PΛα be deﬁned by (2.31) and
(2.32), respectively. Furthermore, deﬁne the projection πΛα : C →PΛα

Then there exist constants γ > 0 and K = K(α, γ) ≥1 such that, for

t ≤0,

Autonomous Functional Diﬀerential Equations

In many cases Theorem 2.21 allows to reduce a problem for functional
diﬀerential equations to a problem for ordinary diﬀerential equations. As
an example we prove below a characterization of stability resp. asymp-
totic stability for equations (1.1) which parallels the corresponding result
for ordinary diﬀerential equations.
Deﬁnition 2.22 a) Equation (1.1) is called stable if and only if there
exists a constant K ≥1 such that, for all φ ∈C,
∥xt(φ)∥≤K∥φ∥,
t ≥0.
b) Equation (1.1) is called asymptotically stable if and only if it is
stable and
lim
t→∞∥xt(φ)∥= 0
for all φ ∈C.
c) Equation (1.1) is called exponentially stable if there exist constants
K ≥1 and β > 0 such that, for all φ ∈C,
∥xt(φ)∥≤K∥φ∥e−βt,
t ≥0.
Theorem 2.23 a) Equation (1.1) is stable if and only if for all eigen-
values λ0 ∈σ(L) the following two conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) Re λ0 ≤0.
(ii) If Re λ0 = 0 then all subspaces of Pλ0 which are cyclic with respect
to A are one-dimensional, i.e., either
k0 < n
and
rank ∆(λ0) = n −k0
or
k0 = n,
∆(λ0) = 0
and
rank ∆′(λ0) = n
(k0 is the multiplicity of λ0).
In case of the scalar n-th order equation (2.14) condition (ii) can be
replaced by
(ii′) Re λ0 = 0 and λ0 is a simple root of det ∆(λ).
b) Equation (1.1) is asymptotically stable if and only if it is exponentially
stable, which is the case if and only if condition (i) is satisﬁed.
Proof.
We choose α = 0 in Theorem 2.21. If all eigenvalues satisfy
condition (i), then Λ0 = ∅, i.e., (I −πΛ0)xt(φ) = xt(φ), t ≥0, and

104
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
the inequality (2.36) implies exponential stability. If on the other hand
(1.1) is asymptotically stable, then (i) must hold. Indeed, if Re λ0 is
an eigenvalue, then there exists a solution of the form beλ0t with b ̸= 0
satisfying ∆(λ0)b = 0. Asymptotic stability implies Re λ0 < 0.
If Λ0 ̸= ∅and (ii) holds, then there is a ﬁnite number of eigenvalues on
the imaginary axis. The solution with initial function φ ∈Pλ0 is bounded
on t ≥0 if and only if all cyclic subspaces of Pλ0 are one-dimensional.
Then the result on stability follows immediately from Proposition 2.13,
a).

with φ ∈Q. Obviously we have
Q =

Let φ ∈Q be given. Then Theorem 2.21 implies that for any α ∈R

following deﬁnition:
5Note that P itself is invariant in the sense of Theorem 2.17, b).

Small solutions and Completeness
105
Deﬁnition 3.1 A solution x(t; φ) of problem (1.1), (1.2) is called a
small solution if and only if x(·; φ) ̸≡0 on [−r, ∞) and
lim
t→∞eβtx(t; φ) = 0
for all β ∈R.
From the considerations before Deﬁnition 3.1 and the obvious fact
that the Laplace-transform of a small solution is an entire function it
follows that Q is the subspace of initial values for small solutions of
equation (1.1). It is easy to see that there exist equations with Q ̸= ∅.
Take for instance
˙x(t) = Ax(t −1),
t ≥0,
with an n × n-matrix A such that A ̸= 0 and A2 = 0 (which implies
n ≥2). We choose
φ(θ) = 1
2Ab + bθ,
−r ≤θ ≤0,
where Ab ̸= 0. Note that φ(θ) ̸= 0 on [−r, 0], because φ(θ0) = 0 would
imply Ab = −1
2θ0b. But A does not have nonzero eigenvalues and Ab ̸=
0. So neither θ0 < 0 nor θ0 = 0 is possible. On [0, 1] the solution is given
by
x(t; φ) = φ(0) +
 t

Aφ(τ −1) dτ = 1
2Ab(t −1)2,

Ax(τ −1; φ) dτ

(τ −2)2dτ = 0,

This implies x(t; φ) = 0 for t ≥1 and consequently φ ∈Q.
The main result of this section is that all small solutions of equations
of the form (1.1) behave like the solution constructed in the example
above.
Theorem 3.2 Let φ ∈C, φ ̸= 0, be given. Then the following is true:
a) x(t; φ) is a small solution of equation (1.1) if and only if there exists
a t1 > −r such that x(t; φ) = 0 for all t ≥t1.

proof of the estimate (1.40))
|p(λ; φ)| ≤

1 + ℓre|λ|r
∥φ∥,
λ ∈C.
Thus the functions adj ∆(λ)p(λ; φ) and det ∆(λ) are entire functions of
exponential type. Since the quotient ∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is also entire, it is
also of exponential type by Proposition B.2.
By Lemma 1.18 we have the estimate

|ω| + 1,

which shows that ˆx(iω; φ) = ∆−1(iω)p(iω; φ) is square integrable on R.
An application of Theorem B.6 proves the result in case ˆx(λ; φ) ̸≡0. If
ˆx(λ; φ) ≡0, then x(t; φ) ≡0 on t ≥0 by Theorem A.1.
b) Theorem B.6 applied to ˆx(λ; φ) gives also a precise characterization
of the minimal interval which contains the support of x(t; φ), i.e., of

tφ > 0, in case ˆx(λ; φ) ̸≡0. Since we want to characterize tφ also for
small solutions with tφ < 0, we have to investigate the Laplace-transform
of y(t) = x(t −r; φ), t ≥0. An easy calculation shows that

Since ˆx(λ; φ) is an entire function of exponential type, the same is true
for ˆy(λ). Moreover, ˆy(λ) ̸≡0, because φ ̸≡0. Since x(t; φ) is a small
solution, the function y(t) has compact support on [0, ∞). Theorem B.6
implies that y(t) = x(t −r; φ) = 0 for t ≥t0, where

The number t0 cannot be replaced by a smaller one. This proves
tφ = t0 −r = lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln |∆−1(−ρ)q(−ρ; φ)|.
In the remaining part of the proof we show that the exponential type
ξ of det ∆(−ρ) can be split oﬀin the formula for tφ. We shall need the
following estimates:
| det ∆(iω)| = O(|ω|n)
as |ω| →∞,
|adj ∆(iω)| ≤O(|ω|n−1)
as |ω| →∞,
|q(iω; φ)| ≤O(|ω|)
as |ω| →∞.
The ﬁrst two estimates are immediate consequences of (1.11) for Re λ =
0 and the deﬁnition of ∆(λ). The third estimate follows from
|q(iω; φ)| ≤

Completeness of generalized eigenfunctions
The subspace Q of initial functions for small solutions of equation (1.1)
is of central importance for the problem of completeness of generalized
eigenfunctions of equation (1.1) in C.
Deﬁnition 3.3 We say that the generalized eigenfunctions of equation
(1.1) are complete in C if and only if
P = C,
i.e., for any φ ∈C there exists a sequence ψn, n = 1, 2, . . . , such that
each ψn is a ﬁnite sum of generalized eigenfunctions of equation (1.1)
and ∥φ −ψn∥→0 as n →∞.
The following result on ker T(t) is easy to prove:
Proposition 3.4 Let
ξ = lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln | det ∆(−ρ)| and σ = lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln | adj ∆(−ρ)|.
Then we have
ker T(t) = Q
for all t ≥σ −ξ.
Proof. If φ ∈ker T(t1) for a t1 ≥0, then T(t)φ = T(t−t1)T(t1)φ = 0 for
all t ≥t1, i.e., x(t; φ) is a small solution of equation (1.1) and therefore we
have φ ∈Q. On the other hand, from (3.2) it is obvious that Q ⊂ker T(t)
for t ≥σ −ξ.
An analogous result on the range of T(t) is much more diﬃcult to
prove:
Theorem 3.5 Let ξ and σ be deﬁned as in Proposition 3.4. Then we
have
range T(t) = P
for all t ≥σ −ξ.
(3.4)
For a proof of this theorem we refer to [12, Section 7.8] and the lit-
erature quoted there. The proof is based on duality theory for equation
(1.1) and the fact that the existence of small solutions to the equation
which corresponds to the adjoint semigroup can be characterized in the
same way as for (1.1). Moreover, in [12] it is proved that α = σ −ξ is
the exact number such that (3.4) holds for t ≥α.
An immediate consequence of Theorem 3.5 is the following character-
ization of completeness:
Corollary 3.6 The eigenfunctions of (1.1) are complete in C if and
only if Q = {0}, which in turn is equivalent to ξ = nr.

Degenerate delay equations
4.1
A necessary and suﬃcient condition
In this section we restrict ourselves to degenerate equations of type
(1.1) and refer for non-autonomous equations to [18] for results and
literature.
L. Weiss considered in his 1967 paper [30] controllability
and in particular null-controllability for linear control systems with time
delay in the state equation. For ODE-systems a necessary and suﬃcient
condition for null-controllability is that a certain matrix – the so called
controllability Grammian – has full rank. For delay systems of retarded
type this condition is only suﬃcient. The proof of necessity would require
that the solutions of the delay equation at any time t ≥0 span all of Rn,
a property which for ODE-systems clearly is satisﬁed. Simple examples
(see for instance [10, p. 41]) show that there exist non-autonomous linear
scalar equations such that all solutions are zero after some ﬁxed time-
interval. L. Weiss posed the question if an analogous phenomenon is
also possible for equations of the form
˙x(t) = A0x(t) + A1x(t −r)
More precisely, the question is, if there exists a t1 > 0 and a vector
q ∈Rn, q ̸= 0, such that qTx(t; φ) = 0 for all solutions of the diﬀerence-
diﬀerential equation and all t ≥t1.
In this chapter we only present a few important fact on degenerate
systems and refer to [18], [19] for further results, for references and
constructions of degenerate systems.
Some parts of the treatment of
the degeneracy problem parallel the investigations of small solutions
in Section 10.
For the rest of the chapter we assume that the delay
equations we consider have complex valued right-hand sides.
Deﬁnition 4.1 System (1.1) is called degenerate if and only if there
exists a vector q ∈Cn \ {0} such that6
lim
t→∞q∗eγtx(t; φ) = 0
for all γ ∈R and all φ ∈C.
(4.1)
If this condition holds, we call system (1.1) degenerate with respect
to q.
A ﬁrst result is the following:
6For a vector a ∈Cn resp. a matrix A ∈Cn×n the conjugate transposed is denoted by a∗
resp. by A∗.

Degenerate delay equations

Proposition 4.2 System (1.1) is degenerate with respect to q ∈Cn\{0}
if and only if
q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ)
is entire for all φ ∈C.
(4.2)
If this condition holds, then there exists a t1 > 0 such that q∗x(t; φ) = 0
for all φ ∈C and all t ≥t1. The smallest t1 with this properties is called
the degeneracy time of system (1.1).
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that (4.1) holds and ﬁx φ ∈C. For any γ ∈R we
have
 ∞
0
e−γtq∗x(t; φ)
 dt =
 ∞
0
e(−γ+1)te−tq∗x(t; φ)

In view of (4.1) there exists an M > 0 with e(−γ+1)t|q∗x(t; φ)| ≤M,
t ≥0. This implies
 ∞
0
e−γtq∗(t; φ)
 dt ≤M.
Thus we have shown that the Laplace-integral for q∗x(t; φ) converges
absolutely for all λ ∈C, i.e., q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is entire.
Next assume that (4.2) holds. We cannot have q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) ≡0
for all φ ∈C. Assume that this is the case. Then we have q∗x(t; φ) = 0
for all t ≥0, which for t = 0 implies q = 0, a contradiction. Choose
φ ∈C such that q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) ̸≡0.
From Lemma 1.18 with α = 0 we get the estimate
q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ)
 ≤|q|const.
|λ|
∥φ∥
for Re λ ≥0 and |λ| suﬃciently large. This proves that q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ)
is square-integrable on λ = iω, ω ∈R. Then the Paley-Wiener theorem
(see Theorem B.6) implies that there exists a tφ > 0 such that
q∗x(t; φ) = 0
for t ≥tφ.
The number tφ is given by
tφ = lim sup

Thus we have established that
0 < tφ ≤(n −1)r + r −ξ = nr −ξ
for all φ ∈C.
The proof of Proposition 4.2 provides also an estimate for the degen-
eracy time:
0 < t1 ≤nr.
(4.3)
The following result will be improved below (see Corollary 4.5):
Corollary 4.3 If ξ = nr, then the equation (1.1) cannot be degenerate.
Proof. If system (1.1) is degenerate then (4.3) shows that ξ < nr.
In case equation (1.1) has the form
˙x(t) =

Ajx(t −hj),
0 = h0 < · · · < hm = r,
(4.4)
then the condition of the corollary is equivalent to
det Am ̸= 0.
The result of Proposition 4.2 has the disadvantage that it refers to
all initial functions φ ∈C. In the following theorem we eliminate this
shortcoming.

Degenerate delay equations
113
Theorem 4.4 (Kappel [18]) Let q ∈Cn\{0} be given. Then equation
(1.1) is degenerate with respect to q if and only if
q∗∆−1(λ)
is entire.
(4.5)
Proof. In view of Proposition 4.2 it is clear that (4.5) is suﬃcient. In
order to prove necessity let us assume that q∗∆−1(λ) is not entire. Then
there exists a λ0 ∈σ(L) such that λ0 is a pole also of q∗∆−1(λ). Choose
a function g(λ) which is holomorphic at λ0 and satisﬁes g(λ0) ̸= 0. Then
q∗∆−1(λ)g(λ) has a pole at λ0. Proposition 2.15 implies that
x(t) := Res
λ=λ0 eλt∆−1(λ)g(λ),
t ∈R,
is a generalized eigenfunction corresponding to λ0. From
q∗x(t) := Res
λ=λ0 eλtq∗∆−1(λ)g(λ),
t ∈R,
we see that q∗x(t) is not identically zero, because eλtq∗∆−1(λ)g(λ) has a
pole at λ0. Since q∗x(t) is real analytic it cannot have an accumulation
point in R of zeros. Consequently q∗x(t) cannot be zero for t ≥t1. Thus
equation (1.1) is not degenerate.
Corollary 4.5 a) Let q ∈Cn \ {0} be given. Then equation (1.1) is
degenerate with respect to q if and only if there exists a t1 > 0 such that7
q∗Y (t) = 0
for t ≥t1.
(4.6)
b) If ξ ≥(n −1)r then equation (1.1) is not degenerate.
Proof. Suppose (4.6) is true. For φ ∈C we have (see Theorem 1.11)
x(t; φ) = Y (t)φ(0) +
 t
0
Y (t −τ)L(φτ) dτ,
t ≥0.
Using (4.6) we get for t ≥t1 + r
q∗x(t; φ) =
 t
t−t1
q∗Y (t −τ)L(φτ) dτ = 0,
because we have τ + θ > t −t1 −r ≥0, −r ≤θ ≤0, and consequently
φτ = 0 for τ ∈(t −t1, t].
If on the other hand equation (1.1) is degenerate with respect to
q, then according to Theorem 4.4 we have that q∗∆−1(λ) is entire.
7Y (·) denotes the fundamental matrix solution of (1.1).

114
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
But q∗∆−1(λ) is of exponential type and square-integrable on λ = iω,
ω ∈R. If q∗∆−1(λ) ≡0 then we have q∗Y (t) = 0 a.e. on [0, ∞). By
continuity of Y (t) we get q∗= q∗Y (0) = 0, a contradiction.
There-
fore we can apply the Paley-Wiener theorem and get q∗Y (t) = 0 for
t ≥td = lim supρ→∞(1/ρ) ln
q∗∆−1(−ρ)
.
The number td cannot be
replaced by a smaller one. As in the proof for Theorem 3.2 we see that
td = lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln
q∗adj ∆(−ρ)
 −ξ.
In order to prove b) we assume that ξ ≥(n −1)r. Since
lim sup
ρ→∞(1/ρ) ln |q∗adj ∆(−ρ)| ≤(n −1)r,
we get the estimate td ≤(n−1)r−(n−1)r = 0. This implies q∗Y (t) = 0,
t ≥−r.
Taking t = 0 we get q = 0, i.e., system (1.1) cannot be
degenerate with respect to any q ∈Cn \ {0}.
Theorem 4.4 is the starting point for various constructions leading to
degenerate functional diﬀerential equations of the form (4.5) (see [19]).
The next result shows that degeneracy is in fact a property of the gen-
eralized eigenspaces of system (1.1).
Proposition 4.6 System (1.1) is degenerate with respect to q ∈Cn\{0}
if and only if
q∗φ(θ) = 0,
−r ≤θ ≤0,
for all φ ∈P =
!
λ∈σ(L)
Pλ
(4.7)
or, equivalently,
q∗x(t; φ) ≡0
for all φ ∈P.
Proof. Note that t →x(t; φ) is analytic on R. Therefore condition(4.7)
is equivalent to the following: For all φ ∈P there exists a sequence
(tn)n∈N ⊂R which has an accumulation point on R and
q∗x(tn; φ) = 0, n = 1, 2, . . . .
Therefore we only have to prove suﬃciency of condition (4.7). Assume
that equation (1.1) is not degenerate with respect to q. Then there exist
a ψ ∈C and a sequence (tn)n∈N ⊂[0, ∞) with tn →∞such that
q∗x(tn; ψ) ̸= 0,
n = 1, 2, . . . .
By (4.7) we see that ψ /∈P.
Furthermore the function q∗ˆx(λ; ψ) =
q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; ψ) cannot be the Laplace-transform of a function with

Degenerate delay equations
115
bounded support. Assume that q∗ˆx(λ; ψ) has a pole at λ0. It is clear
that λ0 ∈σ(L). As in the proof of Theorem 2.17, c), we conclude that
q∗Res
λ=λ0 eλt∆−1(λ)p(λ; ψ) ̸≡0
on R.
Since this function is real analytic it cannot have an accumulation point
of zeros in R. Therefore ψ(θ) = Resλ=λ0 eλθ∆−1(λ)p(λ; ψ), −r ≤θ ≤
0, is a function in Pλ0 such that q∗x(˜tn; ψ) ̸= 0, n = 1, 2, . . . , for a
sequence (˜tn)n∈N ⊂[0, ∞) with ˜tn →∞, which is a contradiction to
(4.7). Thus we have shown that q∗ˆx(t; φ) = q∗∆−1(λ)p(λ; φ) is entire.
From Proposition 4.2 we conclude that system (1.1) is degenerate with
respect to q.
Proposition 4.6 and the characterization of small solutions as given
in Theorem 3.2 show that the degeneracy time depends on the small
solutions only.
Proposition 4.7 Let system (1.1) be degenerate with respect to q ∈
Cn \{0} and denote by td the degeneracy time of system (1.1). Then the
following is true:
a) We have
0 < td ≤lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln
q∗adj ∆(−ρ)
 −ξ.
b) If det ∆(λ) is a polynomial in λ only, then
0 < td ≤lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln
q∗adj ∆(−ρ)
.
Proof. Let ﬁrst φ ∈P ⊕Q and set φ = φP + φQ, φP ∈P, φQ ∈Q.
Then we have q∗x(t; φP ) = 0 for t ≥0, because q∗x(t; ψ) ≡0 for all
ψ ∈P. Consequently
q∗x(t; φ) = q∗x(t; φQ)
for t ≥−r.
We investigate the function y(t) = q∗x(t −r; φQ),
t ≥0. As in the
proof of Theorem 3.2 we see that
q∗x(t; φQ) = 0
for t ≥lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln
q∗adj ∆(−ρ)
 −ξ.
Next choose φ ∈C = P ⊕Q. Then φ = limk→∞(φk + ψk), where
φk ∈P, ψk ∈Q, k = 1, 2, . . . .
Since q∗x(t; φk + ψk) = 0 for t ≥
lim supρ→∞(1/ρ) ln |q∗adj ∆(−ρ)| −ξ, k = 1, 2, . . . , we get also
q∗x(t; φ) = 0
for t ≥lim sup
ρ→∞(1/ρ) ln |q∗adj ∆(−ρ)| −ξ.
It is obvious that ξ = lim supρ→∞(1/ρ) ln | det ∆(−ρ)| = 0 in case that
det ∆(λ) is a polynomial in λ only.

A necessary condition for degeneracy
In this section we ﬁrst prove a necessary condition for degeneracy of
delay equations in terms of a speciﬁc factorization of the characteristic
function. Then we explain the meaning of this necessary condition for
the structure of the degenerate delay equation. We can only prove these
results for diﬀerence-diﬀerential equations with a ﬁnite number of com-
mensurate delays. We start with diﬀerence-diﬀerential equations with a
ﬁnite number of delays:
˙x(t) =

j=0
Ajx(t −hj),
0 = h0 < · · · < hm = r.
(4.8)
View R as an (inﬁnite dimensional) vector space of the ﬁeld Q of rational
numbers and denote by K the positive cone generated by8 h1, . . . , hm.
Let ˜r1, . . . , ˜rk ∈K be linearly independent elements which also generate
K. Then we have
hj =

i=1
αj,i˜ri,
j = 1, . . . , m,
where αj,i ∈Q, αj,i ≥0, j = 1, . . . , m, i = 1, . . . , k. Denote by α the
least common multiple o the denominators of the αj,i’s. Then also the
elements ri = α˜ri, i = 1, . . . , k, generate K and are linearly independent.
We have

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
We have the following claim:
If system (4.10) is degenerate with respect to q, then pj(λ, µ) ̸≡0
for at least one j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(4.11)
In order to prove the claim suppose that p1 ≡· · · ≡pn ≡0. This implies
q∗(λI −A(µ))−1 ≡0 and – taking µ = e−λh –
q∗∆−1(λ) ≡0
in C.
This implies q = 0, a contradiction.
We shall need the following lemma on greatest common divisors of
polynomials in C[λ, µ].
Lemma 4.8 Let p, q ∈C[λ, µ] \ {0} and let d be a greatest common
divisor. We assume that
(i) q(λ, µ) = λκ + ˜q(λ, µ) with λ-degree ˜q < κ,
(ii) ∂p(λ, µ)/∂µ ̸≡0 and
(iii) p(λ, µ)
q(λ, µ) is entire.
Then we have ∂d/∂µ ̸≡0, i.e., d really depends on µ.
Proof.
Because of assumption (i) the function q

λ, e−λh
has inﬁ-
nitely many diﬀerent zeros λ1, λ2, . . . (see [2]). By assumption (ii) also
p

λ, e−λh
has at least the zeros λ1, λ2, . . . . From Lemma D.1 with
m = 2 we see that there exist R1, R2 ∈C[λ, µ] and a w ∈C[λ] such that
p(λ, µ)R1(λ, µ) + q(λ, µ)R2(λ, µ) = w(λ)d(λ, µ).
If d does not depend on µ, d = d(λ), then the last equation implies
w(λν)d(λν) = 0,
ν = 1, 2, . . . ,
which is not possible. Note that d ̸≡0 because p ̸≡0 and q ̸≡0. Then
d must depend on µ.
Theorem 4.9 (Zverkin [32]) Assume that system (4.10) is degener-
ate. Then there exists a monic polynomial s0 ∈C[λ] with degree s0 ≥1
such that
det(λI −A(µ)) = s0(λ)s1(λ, µ)
with some monic polynomial s1 ∈C[λ, µ]. Consequently we also have
∆(λ) = s0(λ)s1(λ, e−λh).

Degenerate delay equations
119
Proof. We follow the algebraic proof given in [18]. If p0(λµ) = det(λI −
A(µ)) does not depend on µ, then there is nothing to be proved. Assume
that ∂p0/∂µ ̸≡0. According to the claim (4.11) we have pj0 ̸≡0 for
some j0 ∈{1, . . . , n}. Since, by Theorem 4.4, q∗∆−1(λ) is entire for
some q ∈Cn \ {0}, we can apply Lemma 4.8 and get
p0(λ, µ) = d(λ, µ)s0(λ, µ) and pj0(λ, µ) = d(λ, µ)sj0(λ, µ),
where d is a greatest common divisor of p0 and pj0. Moreover we have
∂d/∂µ ̸≡0.
Since pj0(λ, e−λh)/p0(λ, e−λh) = sj0(λ, e−λh)/s0(λ, e−λh) is entire,
Lemma 4.8 implies that in case ∂s0/∂µ ̸≡0 there exists a greatest com-
mon divisor ˜d of sj0 and s0 with ∂˜d/∂µ ̸≡0. But then d ˜d would be a
common divisor of pj0 and p0, a contradiction with the deﬁnition of d
because ˜d is non-constant. Thus we have ∂s0/∂µ ≡0, i.e., s0 ∈C[λ].
4.3
Coordinate transformations with delays
Theorem D.5 states that corresponding to a factorization of the char-
acteristic polynomial χA(λ, µ) of a matrix A(µ) ∈Cn×n[µ] we can trans-
form A by a similarity transform with a unimodular matrix to a block-
triangular form. In this section we want to investigate the meaning of
this transformation for the delay equation (4.10) corresponding to A.
Deﬁnition 4.10 Let S(µ) = S0+· · ·+Sk′µk′ be a unimodular matrix in
Cn×n[µ] with inverse S−1(µ) = T0+· · ·+Tkµk. For x, y ∈C(−∞, ∞; Cn)
we deﬁne the linear mappings π, π−1 : C(−∞, ∞; Cn) →C(−∞, ∞; Cn)
by
(πx)(t) = T0 + · · · + Tkx(t −kh) and
(π−1y)(t) = S0 + · · · + Sk′y(t −k′h),
t ∈R.
(4.12)
If we deﬁne the shift σ : C(−∞, ∞; Cn) →C(−∞, ∞; Cn) by (σx)(t) =
x(t −h), t ∈R, then(4.12) can also be written as
πx = S−1(σ)x,
π−1y = S(σ)y,
x, y ∈C(−∞, ∞; Cn).
From this it is also clear that π and π−1 are indeed inverses of each
other.
Let A, ˜A ∈Cn×n[µ] be given with
˜A = S−1AS,
where S ∈Cn×n[µ] is unimodular and let π, π−1 be the mappings deﬁned
by (4.12) Furthermore let

and
˙y(t) =


(t) =: ˜L(yt)
(4.14)
be the delay systems corresponding to A resp. ˜A. Then we have the
following result:
Proposition 4.11 a) If x ∈C(−∞, ∞; Cn) solves (4.13) for t ≥t0,
then y = πx solves (4.14) at least for t ≥t0 + kh.
b) Let L1 resp. L2 denote the subspaces of C(−∞, ∞; Cn) consisting of
all x resp. y which are solutions of (4.13) resp. (4.14) on R. Then π
maps L1 one-to-one onto L2.
Proof. a) let x ∈C(−∞, ∞; Cn) be a solution of (4.13) for t ≥t0, i.e.,
x is diﬀerentiable for t ≥t0 and
˙x(t) =

A(σ)x

(t),
t ≥t0.
Set y(t) = T0x(t) + · · · + Tkx(t −kh). Then it is easy to see that y is
diﬀerentiable at least for t ≥t0 + kh and
˙y(t) =


(t) =

t ≥t0 + kh.
b) In view of part a) of the theorem it is clear that πL1 ⊂L2. For y ∈L2
we have x = π−1y ∈L1 and πx = y, i.e., πL1 = L2.

ˆ∆k(λ0) = ˜Tk(λ0) ˜∆k(λ0) ˜Sk(λ0).
(4.16)
From ˜∆k(λ0)˜bk = 0 and (4.16) we get
ˆ∆k(λ0)ˆck = ˜Tk(λ0) ˜∆k(λ0) ˜Sk(λ0) ˜Tk(λ0)˜bk.

Thus we have shown that πXk(λ0) ⊂˜Xk(λ0). Taking π−1 instead of
π we obtain π−1 ˜Xk(λ0) ⊂Xk(λ0).

Remark.
Let [−r, 0] resp. [−˜r, 0] denote the delay interval for sys-
tem (4.13) resp. (4.14). By Corollary 2.11 we see that ker(λ0I −A) =
{x |[−r,0]| x ∈Xk(λ0)} and ker(λ0I −˜
A) = {y |[−˜r,0]| y ∈˜Xk(λ0)}. We
also have seen in Section 7 that
Pλ0 = ker(λ0I −A)k,
˜Pλ0 = ker(λ0I −˜

P = %
λ0∈σ(L) Pλ0, ˜P = %
λ0∈σ(L) ˜Pλ0, as follows:
πφ = πx(·; φ) |[−˜r,0] .
Then it is clear that π maps P one-to-one onto ˜P.
The result of
Lemma 4.13 implies that π also maps ker(λ0I −A)k one-to-one onto
ker(λ0I −˜
A)k, k = 1, 2, . . . .
The next result states that a coordinate transform with delays given
by a unimodular matrix does not change the structure of the generalized
eigenspaces as given in Theorem 2.12.
Theorem 4.14 Let ˜A(µ) = S−1(µ)A(µ)S(µ) with a unimodular matrix
S ∈Cn×n[µ].
For λ0 ∈σ(L) = σ(˜L) denote by Pλ0 resp. ˜Pλ0 the
generalized eigenspace of system (4.13) resp. of (4.14).
Then there exist uniquely determined numbers ℓ≥1, dρ, mρ with
mρ > 0, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ, satisfying 0 ≤d1 < · · · < dℓsuch that
Pλ0 =

where the subspaces Zρ,j of Pλ0 resp. ˜Zρ,j of ˜Pλ0 satisfy
(i) dim Zρ,j = dim ˜Zρ,j = dρ, j = 1, . . . , mρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ,
(ii) Zρ,j is A-cyclic and ˜Zρ,j is ˜
A-cyclic, j = 1, . . . , mρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ.
Moreover, we can take
˜Zρ,j = πZρ,j,
j = 1, . . . , mρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ.
Proof. From Lemma 2.5 and the proof for part (iv) of Theorem 2.4 we
see that the numbers ℓ, mρ, dρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ℓ, which exist according to
Theorem 2.4 for ∆(λ) = λI −A(e−λh) resp. for ˜∆(λ) = λI −˜A(e−λh) at
λ0 are the same. This establishes the decomposition (4.17).
Using the facts that the action of A and of ˜
A is diﬀerentiation, that π
and π commute with diﬀerentiation and that ˙x(·; φ) = x(·; ˙φ) for φ ∈Pλ0
(see Theorem 1.9) we get, for φ ∈Pλ0,

Remark. It is easy to see (but tedious to formulate) that all results
presented in this section hold also with appropriate notational changes
for the case of non-commensurate delays.
4.4
The structure of degenerate systems with
commensurate delays
The necessary condition for degeneracy of systems with commensurate
delays given in Zverkin’s theorem together with the triangularization
theorem for polynomial matrices over the ring C[µ] (see Theorem D.5)
suggest that degenerate systems with commensurate delays can be trans-
formed to a system which consists of two coupled subsystems, where
one of these subsystems is degenerate and has a polynomial of λ only as
its characteristic function. Loosely speaking, degenerate systems with
commensurate delays are those which are similar (under transformations
with delays) to ordinary diﬀerential equations. The precise statement is
the following:
Theorem 4.15 Assume that system (4.13) is degenerate with respect to
q ∈Cn \ {0} and that in the factorization
χA(λ, µ) = p1(λ, µ)p2(λ)
with monic and relatively prime polynomials the polynomial p1 does not
contain a non-trivial factor independent of µ. Then there exists a uni-
modular matrix S ∈Cn×n[µ] such that
˜A = S−1AS =

A1
A1,2
0
A2
 
with A1 ∈Cn1×n1[µ], A2 ∈Cn2×n2[µ], where n1 = λ– degree p1, n2 =
degree p2 > 0, and
χA1 = p1,
χA2 = p2.

Degenerate delay equations
125
Moreover, the delay system corresponding to A2(µ) is degenerate with
respect to a q2 ∈Cn2 \ {0}, whereas the delay system corresponding to
A1(µ) is not degenerate.
Proof.
Without restriction of generality we can assume that q =
col(0, q2) with q2 = col(1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈Cn2. Otherwise we choose a in-
vertible matrix T ∈Cn×n such that q∗T = (0, q∗
2) and replace A(µ) by
T −1A(µ)T.
By Zverkin’s result it is clear that n2 > 0. According to Theorem D.5
there exists a unimodular matrix S ∈Cn×n[µ] such that ˜A(µ) has the
properties given in the theorem. Since p1(λ, µ) does not contain a non-
trivial factor which depends in λ only, the delay system corresponding
to A1(µ) cannot be degenerate.
It remains to prove that we can choose S such that the delay system
corresponding to A2(µ) is degenerate with respect to q2. According to
Theorem 4.4 the function q∗∆−1(λ) is entire. This implies that also

The matrix

λI −˜A(µ)

Since the matrix (4.18) is entire, we see that also q∗W1(λ) is entire.
Suppose that q∗U(µ) ̸≡0. Then we see that at least one rj0(λ, µ) in the
representation
q∗U(µ)

λI −A1(µ)
−1 =

p1(λ, µ)

r1(λ, µ), . . . , rn1(λ, µ)

is not identically zero. As in the proof of Theorem 4.9 we see that
rj0(λ, µ) = sj0(λ, µ)d(λ, µ),
p1(λ, µ) = s0(λ)d(λ, µ).

126
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
From λ – degree rj0 < λ – degree p1 we conclude that degree s0 > 0. But
then p1(λ, µ) has a non-trivial factor depending on λ only, which con-
tradicts the assumption made on p1. This proves that
q∗U

e−λh
≡0.
Consequently we get

(4.19)
We have q∗V (e−λh) ̸≡0. Otherwise we would have q∗S(e−λh) ˜∆−1(λ) ≡
0, which implies q = 0, a contradiction.
Let v(µ) be the (n1 + 1)-st row of V (µ), i.e., q∗V (µ) = v(µ). This
and q∗U(µ) ≡0 imply that (0, . . . , 0, v(µ)) is the (n1 +1)-st row of S(µ).
Set v(µ) =

v1(µ), . . . , vn2(µ)

and let w be a greatest common divisor
of v1, . . . , vn2. Then S(µ) = w(µ) ˜S(µ) and det S(µ) ∈C \ {0} imply
w = α ∈C \ {0}.
Under this condition we can ﬁnd a unimodular matrix P ∈Cn2×n2[µ]
which has v as its ﬁrst row,
P(µ) =



Using the special form of q2 we obtain
q∗V (µ) = v(µ) = q∗

This implies

λI −A2(µ)
−1P −1(µ) = q∗V (µ)

lar matrix T(µ) = S(µ) diag(I, P −1(µ)), then the matrix T −1(µ)A(µ)T(µ)

Laplace-transforms

Appendix: A
Laplace-Transforms
In this appendix we collect some results on Laplace-transforms. With a few excep-
tions we do not provide proofs, but refer to the standard literature (see for instance
[7]).
Let f be in L1
loc(0, ∞; C) and λ ∈C. Then the Laplace-integral of f at λ is
deﬁned by
 ∞
0
e−λtf(t) dt = lim
ω→∞
 ω
0
e−λtf(t) dt.
(A.1)
We say that the Laplace-integral for f converges at λ if the limit in (A.1) exists,
converges absolutely at λ if limω→∞
 ω
0 e−t Re λ|f(t)| dt exists and converges uniformly
on a set D ⊂C if the limit in (A.1) exists uniformly for λ ∈D.
If the Laplace-integral for f converges absolutely at λ0, so it also does in Re λ ≥λ0.
Therefore the domain of absolute convergence of the Laplace-integral is an open or
closed right half plane. We deﬁne the abscissa of absolute convergence by
σa(f) = inf{σ ∈R |The Laplace-integral for f is
absolutely convergent at σ}.
If the Laplace-integral converges at λ0, then it is uniformly convergent in any sector
{λ ∈C | | arg(λ −λ0)| ≤ε},
0 ≤ε < π/2.
In particular it converges in Re λ > Re λ0. Therefore the domain of convergence of
the Laplace-integral is an open right half plane plus a subset of the boundary. We
deﬁne the abscissa of convergence by
σc(f) = inf{σ ∈R | The Laplace-integral for f converges at σ}.
It is clear that
−∞≤σc ≤σa ≤∞.
All cases, except equality everywhere, are possible for these inequalities.
By the
uniform convergence of the Laplace-integral in sectors the function
ˆf(λ) =
 ∞
0
e−λtf(t) dt,
Re λ > σc(f),
is holomorphic in the half plane Re λ > σc(f). We shall also use the notation L(f) =
ˆf. The derivatives of ˆf are given by
dj ˆf
dλj (λ) = (−1)j
 ∞
0
e−λttjf(t) dt,
Re λ > σc(f).
ˆf is called the Laplace-transform of f. Frequently we shall denote by ˆf or L(f)
also the function obtained by analytic continuation.
Of fundamental importance is the following uniqueness result:
Theorem A.1 Let ˆf and ˆg be Laplace-transforms of functions f and g, respectively.
If ˆf = ˆg in some right half plane, then f(t) = g(t) a.e. on t ≥0.

128
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
It is clear that taking Laplace-transforms is a linear operation. We next collect
results on the behavior of the Laplace-transform with respect to integration, diﬀer-
entiation and convolution.
Theorem A.2 Let f ∈L1
loc(0, ∞; C) with σc(f) < ∞and set g(t) =
 t
0 f(τ) dτ, t ≥
0. Assume that the Laplace-integral for f is convergent at λ0 ∈R. Then the Laplace-
integral for g converges in Re λ > 0 if λ0 = 0 and in {λ ∈C | Re λ > λ0} ∪{λ0} if
λ0 > 0. Moreover,
ˆg(λ) = 1
λ
ˆf(λ)
and
g(t) =

O(1)
if λ0 = 0,
o

eλ0t
if λ0 > 0
as t →∞.
Theorem A.3 Let f be locally absolutely continuous on t ≥0 and suppose that
σc( ˙f) < ∞. Then σc(f) ≤σc( ˙f) and
L( ˙f)(λ) = λL(f)(λ) −f(0).
Moreover, for any real λ0, where the Laplace-integral for ˙f converges, we have
f(t) = o

eλ0t
as t →∞.
Proposition A.4 Let fi ∈L1
loc(0, ∞; C), i = 1, 2, be given.
Then the integral
 t
0 f1(t −τ)f2(τ) dτ exists a.e. on t ≥0 and the function f deﬁned by this integral,
where it exists, and by f(t) = 0 otherwise is in L1
loc(0, ∞; C).
The function f whose existence is guaranteed by the above proposition is called the
convolution of f1 and f2, f = f1 ∗f2.
The operation “ ∗” is commutative and
associative. We shall need the following results on smoothness of f1 ∗f2.
Theorem A.5 Let fi ∈L1
loc(0, ∞; C), i = 1, 2, be given. If f1 is bounded on bounded
intervals or if f1 and f2 are in L2
loc(0, ∞; C), then f = f1 ∗f2 is continuous on t ≥0.
Theorem A.6 Let f1 be locally absolutely continuous on t ≥0 and f2 be in L1
loc(0, ∞; C).
Then f = f1 ∗f2 is locally absolutely continuous on t ≥0 and
˙f = ˙f1 ∗f2 + f1(0)f2
a.e. on t ≥0.
Concerning Laplace-transforms of convolutions we have:
Theorem A.7 Let fi ∈L1
loc(0, ∞; C), i = 1, 2, be given and suppose that σa(f1) ≤x0
and σa(f2) ≤x0. Then σa(f1 ∗f2) ≤x0 and
L(f1 ∗f2) = L(f1)L(f2).
If a function ˆf(λ) is holomorphic in some right half plane, then it is of interest to
know if it is a Laplace-transform.
Theorem A.8 Let ˆf be holomorphic in Re λ > x1 and assume that
(i) for any ε > 0 and any δ > 0 there exists a K > 0 such that
| ˆf(λ)| ≤ε
for Re λ ≥x1 + δ and |λ| ≥K,

Entire Functions
In this appendix we quote some facts on entire functions, which are used in the
section on small solutions. As standard references we cite [5, 23].
Deﬁnition B.1 A function f : C →C is called an entire function of exponential
type if and only if f is holomorphic in C and there exist constants α, β ≥0 such that
|f(λ)| ≤αeβ|λ|
for all λ ∈C.
The number
τf = lim sup
ρ→∞
1
ρ ln M(ρ),
where M(ρ) = max|λ|=ρ |f(λ)|, is called the exponential type of f.

It is trivial that the sum and the product of two entire functions of exponential
type are again such functions. Less trivial is the result on quotients:
Proposition B.2 If f and g are entire functions of exponential type, then f/g is
also an entire function of exponential type provided it is entire.
For a proof of this proposition see for instance [23, p. 24].
A detailed description of the growth behavior of an entire function of exponential
type at inﬁnity given by the indicator function:
Deﬁnition B.3 Let f be an entire function of exponential type. The function hf :
[0, 2π] →R deﬁned by
hf(θ) = lim sup
ρ→∞

ρ ln |f(ρeiθ)|
is called the indicator function of f.
For a detailed representation of the general properties of indicator functions see
for instance [23, Ch. 1, Sect. 15] or [5, Ch. 5]. We just mention the following result:
Proposition B.4 Let f be an entire function of exponential type. If f ̸≡0, then hf
is ﬁnite and continuous.
If we have information on the behavior of f on a vertical line, we obtain a very
precise information on the indicator function.
For our purpose very useful is the
following result (cf. [23, p. 243] or [5, p. 116]):
Theorem B.5 Let f ̸≡0 be a function of exponential type. If

and, for θ in a dense subset of [π/2, 3π/2],
hf(θ) = lim

ρ ln |f(ρeiθ)|.
The function ln+ is deﬁned by ln+ ξ = max(0, ln ξ), ξ > 0. Condition (B.1) can be
replaced by (see [23, p. 251])

(B.2)
Of fundamental importance for us is the following characterization of those entire
functions of exponential type which are two-sided Laplace-transforms of functions
with compact support.
Theorem B.6 (Paley-Wiener) Let f ̸≡0 be an entire function of exponential type.
Then the following two statements are equivalent:
(i) There exist constants H′, H ∈R with −H′ < H and a square-integrable F with
support in [−H′, H] such that
f(λ) =

Moreover, if we take H′ = hf(0) and H = hf(π), then the interval [−H′, H] cannot
be replaced by a smaller one.
For a proof of this theorem see [23, p. 387], [5, p. 103] or [7, Vol. III, pp. 238, 241].
Finally, Hadamard’s factorization theorem assumes the following form for functions
of exponential type (see [23, p. 24] or [5, p. 22]):
Theorem B.7 Let f be an entire function of exponential type and let (an) be the
ﬁnite or inﬁnite sequence of nonzero zeros of f. Moreover, assume that λ = 0 is a
zero of multiplicity m. Then there exist numbers α, β ∈C such that

An Unsymmetric Fubini Theorem
For the convenience of the reader we state in this appendix the unsymmetric Fubini
theorem of [6].
In the following it is always assumed that functions which are of
bounded variation on bounded intervals are normalized by the requirement to be
right-hand continuous.
Theorem C.1 Assume that the functions k : R →R, s : R →R and p : R × R →R
satisfy:
a) k is of bounded variation on bounded intervals.
b) s is Borel measurable on R.
c) p is Borel measurable on R × R and, for k-almost all σ ∈R, the function p(σ, ·) is
of bounded variation on bounded intervals.

Results on Polynomial Rings and Modules
over Polynomial Rings
In this appendix we present the basic deﬁnitions and results concerning the theory
of polynomial rings and modules over polynomial rings.
We give proofs for those
results where a proof is not available in the literature in the form needed here.
We denote by C[λ1, . . . , λm] the ring of polynomials in the indeterminates λ1, . . .
. . . , λm, m ≥1, over the ﬁeld C. The ring C[λ] is a Euclidean ring and consequently
also a principal ideal domain.
The rings C[λ1, . . . , λm] with m ≥2 are not even
principal ideal domains, but unique factorization domains. Therefore the concepts
”greatest common divisor” and ”least common multiple” are well deﬁned in all of
these rings. If r1, r2 are polynomial in C[λ], then there exists a greatest common
divisor d ∈C[λ] which can be computed by the Euclidean algorithm. Moreover there
exist polynomials R1, R2 ∈C[λ] with
d = r1R1 + r2R2.
This result in C[λ] has the following analogue in the rings C[λ1, . . . , λm], m ≥2:
Lemma D.1 Let r1, r2 ∈C[λ1, . . . , λm], m ≥2, be given and let d be a greatest
common divisor of r1, r2. Then there exist polynomials R1, R2 ∈C[λ1, . . . , λm] and
a polynomial w ∈C[λ1, . . . , λm−1] such that
r1(λ1, . . . , λm)R1(λ1, . . . , λm) + r2(λ1, . . . , λm)R2(λ1, . . . , λm)
= w(λ1, . . . , λm−1)d(λ1, . . . , λm).
A proof of this result can be found in [29].
Next we state some deﬁnitions and results concerning module theory. As general
references for module theory we quote [1], [3], [4], [16], [27].
Let M be an additive, commutative group and R a commutative ring with multi-
plicative unit 1. Then M (more precisely (M, R)) is called a module over R if and
only if there is a scalar multiplication (r, x) ∈R × M →rx ∈M satisfying
r(x1 + x2) = rx1 + rx2,
r ∈R, x1, x2 ∈M,
(r1 + r2)x = r1x + r2x,
r1, r2 ∈R, x ∈M, and
1 · x = x,
x ∈M.
The modules which are most similar to vector spaces are the free modules. A module
M over R is called a free module if and only if there exists a basis e1, . . . , en ∈M
for M, i.e., every element x ∈M has a unique representation x = α1e1 + · · · + αnen,
αi ∈R, i = 1, . . . , n, and α1e1 + · · · + αnen = 0 implies α1 = · · · = αn = 0 (linear
independence).
The modules Cn[λ1, . . . , λn] are free modules, a basis being e1 =

col(1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , col(0, . . . , 0, 1) (canonical basis). A set U is called a submodule
of M if and only if it is again a module over R, i.e., for α1, α2 ∈R and x1, x2 ∈U we
have also α1x1 + α2x2 ∈U.
We shall need results on the modules M = Cn[λ1, . . . , λm] over the ring R =
C[λ1, . . . , λm].
The module Cn[λ, . . . , λm] consists of all n-vectors col(x1, . . . , xn)
with xi ∈C[λ1, . . . , λm], i = 1, . . . , n. The module Cn[λ] is special among the modules
Cn[λ1, . . . , λm] by the following property:
Lemma D.2 Every submodule of C[λ] is a free module.
This result in fact is valid for free modules over principal ideal domains (see [16, p. 78]
or [27, p. 109]).
An important question in module theory is the following: If X is a submodule
of M, does there exist another submodule Y of M such that M = X ⊕Y ?
We
know that the answer is ”yes” for vector spaces. But even for the module Cn[λ] the
answer in general is ”no”. However we have also a positive result. In order to state
this result we need a deﬁnition. For a1, . . . , ak ∈Cn[λ] let S = span(a1, . . . , ak) =
{α1a1 + · · · + αkak | αi ∈C[λ], i = 1, . . . , k}. Obviously S is a submodule of Cn[λ],
the submodule generated by a1, . . . , ak.
Proposition D.3 Let A ∈Cn×n[λ] (i.e., A is an n × n-matrix with elements in
C[λ]). Then there exists a submodule X of Cn[λ] such that
Cn[λ] = ker A ⊕X.
We can take X = span(x1, . . . , xk) for any elements x1, . . . , xk ∈Cn[λ] such that
Ax1, . . . , Axk is a basis for range A.
This result is a special case of the corresponding result for epimorphisms where the
range is a free submodule (see [27, p. 108]). Note that by Lemma D.2 the submodule
range A is a free module. Take a basis y1, . . . , yk of range A and elements x1, . . . , xk ∈
Cn[λ] with yi = Axi, i = 1, . . . , k. Observe that x1, . . . , xk are linearly independent,
because otherwise also y1, . . . , yk would be linearly dependent and could not be a
basis for range A.
For matrices A ∈Cn×n[µ1, . . . , µm] we deﬁne the characteristic polynomial χA ∈
C[λ, µ1, . . . , µm] by
χA(λ, µ1, . . . , µm) = det

λI −A(µ1, . . . , µm)

.
For A ∈Cn×n[µ1, . . . , µm] and p ∈C[λ, µ1, . . . , µm] we set (with some abuse of
notation)
p(A) = p(A, µ1, . . . , µm) ∈Cn×n[µ1, . . . , µm].
Then as in vector space theory we have (see for instance [27, p. 246])
Theorem D.4 (Cayley-Hamilton) For every matrix A ∈Cn×n[µ1, . . . , µm], m ≥
1, we have
χA(A) = 0.
On the basis of Proposition D.3 we can prove the following result on block-
triangularization of matrices in Cn×n[µ]:
Theorem D.5 ([19, Theorem 2.1]) Let A ∈Cn×n[µ] be given and assume that
χA = p1p2,

134
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
where p1, p2 ∈C[λ, µ] are relatively prime (i.e., 1 is a greatest common divisor) and
monic (i.e., the coeﬃcient of the largest power of λ is 1). Set ni = degree pi and
assume ni > 0, i = 1, 2. Then there exists a unimodular matrix S ∈Cn×n[µ] (i.e.,
det S(µ) ≡c ∈C \ {0} or, equivalently, also S−1(µ) ∈Cn×n[µ]) such that
˜A = S−1AS =
A1
A1,2
0
A2
 
∈Cn×n[µ],
χAi = pi,
i = 1, 2.
In general we cannot ﬁnd S such that A1,2 = 0.
Proof.
We set C = p1(A) and choose a basis ˜e1, . . . , ˜er of ker C (observe that
ker C is a free module), where 0 < r < n. Choose ˜er+1, . . . ˜en ∈Cn[µ] such that
C˜er+1, . . . , C˜en is a basis for range C. Then according to Proposition D.3 we have
Cn[µ] = ker C ⊕span

˜er+1, . . . , ˜en

.
Note that as in vector space theory all bases of Cn[µ] have the same number of
elements.
Let x ∈ker C, i.e., we have Cx = 0. Since A and C commute, this implies CAx =
ACx = 0, i.e., Ax ∈ker C. Consequently ker C is A-invariant. Let S ∈Cn×n[µ]
denote the matrix corresponding to the change of bases e1, . . . , en →˜e1, . . . , ˜en and
denote by ˜A the representation of the endomorphism x →Ax with respect to the
basis ˜e1, . . . , ˜en. Then we have ˜A = S−1AS. In view of the invariance of ker C with
respect to this endomorphism we see that ˜A must have the form given in the theorem.
It remains to prove χA1 = p1. Then χA = χA1χA2 automatically implies χA2 = p2.
Let C(µ) denote the ﬁeld of rational functions of µ with coeﬃcients in C and Cn(µ)
the vector space of all n-vectors with elements in C(µ). Then we can view A and C
also as matrices in Cn×n(µ). Let x ∈Cn(µ) with Cx = 0 be given. We can write x as
x = 1
s ˜x,
s ∈C(µ), ˜x ∈Cn[µ],
where s is the least common multiple of the denominators of the coordinates of x.
Then Cx = 0 also implies C˜x = 0, i.e.,
˜x =

i=1
αi˜ei,
αi ∈C[µ], i = 1, . . . , r.
This implies x = r


αi/s

˜ei. We conclude that ˜e1, . . . , ˜er is also a basis for ker C
in C(µ). But then vector space theory implies χA1 = p1.
That in general we have A1,2 ̸= 0 is demonstrated by the following example. Let
A =
µ

with χA(λ, µ) = (λ −µ)λ, p1(λ, µ) = λ −µ, p2(λ, µ) = λ. From
˜A =

A1,2

A2
 
and χA1 = λ −µ, χA2 = λ we conclude that A1 = (µ) and A2 = (0). Assume that
we can choose a unimodular S ∈C2[µ] such that A1,2 = (0) and set
S =

(D.4)
Case 1: t1,1 = 0.
Equation (D.4) implies µ = 0, a contradiction.
Case 2: s1,2µ + s2,2 = 0.
Then equations (D.1) and (D.2) are satisﬁed. Assume that s1,1µ + s2,1 = 0. Then
(D.4) implies µ = 0, which is impossible. Thus we have s1,1µ + s2,1 ̸= 0. From (D.3)
we then get t2,1 = 0, i.e., we have
S−1 =
t1,1
t1,2
0
t2,2
 
.
Consequently we have s2,1 = 0. But this and s1,2µ + s2,2 = 0 imply s2,2 = 0, so that
det S(µ) ≡0.
Thus we have shown that neither case is possible, i.e., we never can get A1,2 = 0.
Analogously we can see that A cannot be transformed to diag(0, µ).
The result of Theorem D.5 does not carry over to Cn[µ1, . . . , µm] in case m ≥2.
The following example was given in [21]. Let
A(µ, ν) =
µ2
µν
µν
ν2
 
∈C2×2[µ, ν]
be given. Then we have χA(λ, µ, ν) = λ

λ −µ2 −ν2
=: p1(λ, µ, ν)p2(λ, µ, ν). We
have p1(A) = A and ker p1(A) = span

col(ν, −µ)

. Assume that there exists a free
submodule X = span

col(α, β)

such that
C2[µ.ν] = ker p1(A) ⊕X.
This implies that the vectors col(1, 0) and col(0, 1) (which constitute a basis for
C2[µ.ν]) are linear combinations of col(ν, −µ) and col(α, β), i.e., there exist poly-
nomials pi, qi ∈C[µ, ν], i = 1, 2, such that
1 = νp1 + αp2,
(D.5)
0 = −µp1 + βp2,
(D.6)
0 = νq1 + αq2,
(D.7)
1 = −µq1 + βq2.
(D.8)
From (D.6) we see that µ divides βp2.

136
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Case 1: µ | p2.
This implies p2 = µ˜p2, ˜p2 ∈C[µ, ν], and in view of (D.6) µ(−p1 + β˜p2) = 0. Conse-
quently we have p1 = β˜p2. Then (D.5) implies
1 = ˜p2(νβ + µα),
which is impossible.
Case 2: µ | β.
In this case we have β = µ˜β, ˜β ∈C[µ, ν], and get from (D.8)
1 = µ(−q1 + ˜βq2),
which again is impossible.
Thus we have shown that ker p1(A) is not a direct summand in C2[µ, ν]. For p2
we have
p2(A) =
−ν2
µν
µν
−µ2
 
and ker p2(A) = span

col(µ, ν)

. Analogously as above we prove that also ker p2(A)
is not a direct summand of C2[µ, ν].

in which X0 is the matrix-valued function deﬁned by
X0(θ) = 0, for θ < 0; X0(0) = IdRn
and TL(t) is the semigroup associated with the homogeneous equation
on the space C = C ([−r, 0] , Rn).
Formula (1.2) indicates that TL(t)
is evaluated at X0 although this function (only considering the column
vectors) is not continuous and so is not in the space where the semigroup
is deﬁned. In the literature, this odd fact is discretely overlooked by

using the expression ”formal”. One should note that a rigorous variation
of constants formula exists: it is enough to use the fundamental solution
U(t) instead of TL(t)X0. In terms of U(t), the solution x reads
x(t) =
 t

U(t −s)f(s)ds
The shortcoming of the above formula is that it is not expressed at the
level of the phase space of the equation, which makes it diﬃcult to use
in the study of dynamical features of the solutions. The inconvenience
caused by this apparent inconsistency is particularly visible when deal-
ing with semilinear equations and stability or bifurcation issues. A ﬁrst
step in the direction of resolving this inconsistency was made by Chow
and Mallet-Paret In a later work (1980, not published), Arino proposed
a solution close to the one proposed in , that is, to work in the space
C1 instead of C. These approaches are in fact very close to one which
emerged a few years later, ﬁrst, in a completely diﬀerent context, that
is, the theory of integrated semigroups. We will come to this theory last
part of this chapter, it will be discussed and used in diﬀerent context
by M.Adimy and K.Ezzinbi in the third part of this book . Recently,
Maniar, Rhandi et al .use extrapolation theory to discuss the same
problem.
Another approach burgeoned in the mid-eighties (1984-85)
within a group of ﬁve people, Ph.Clement, O.Diekmann, M.Gyllenberg,
H.J.A.M.Heijmans and H.R.Thieme (1985), that is, the approach of em-
bedding the problem set in a larger space containing not only continuous
functions but also such functions as X0, a space intermediary between
the space C and its bidual.
This approach was not new, a thorough
study of the relationships between the dual and the adjoint semigroups
has been performed by
E.Hille and R.S.Phillips(1957), and a number
of important results are to be found in their book. It seems that it had
been reviviﬁed by H.Amann in a completely diﬀerent context. In the
next section, We will now give a very short summary of dual semigroups
and we will show how it can be used to provide a rigorous variation of
constants formula in the case of delay diﬀerential equations.The last sec-
tion of this chapter will be devoted to show how the theory of integrated
semigroups can be used to provide a rigorous variation of constants for-
mula. An important consequence of both of these theories is to give new
and interesting perspectives of DDE.

2.1
Duality and semigroups
Let A be the inﬁnitesimal generator of a C0-semi-group (T(t))t≥0 in
a Banach space X.
T ∗(t) is a semigroup on the dual space X∗of X. In the general case
T ∗(t) is not strongly continuous. It is strongly continuous when X is
reﬂexive. Following Hille and Phillips (1957)[21], we deﬁne
X⊙=
0
x∗∈X∗: lim
t→0 ∥T ∗(t)x∗−x∗∥= 0
1
(2.3)
X⊙(pronunciated as X −sun) is the space of strong continuity of T ∗(t).
It is a closed subspace of X∗. One can determine X⊙in terms of A∗. In
fact, we have ([21]):
X⊙= D(A∗)
(2.4)
(this is the closure with respect to the strong topology of X∗, this result
shows that X⊙⊇D(A∗)).
The restriction of T ∗(t) to X⊙, denoted
T ⊙(t), is a strongly continuous semigroup of linear bounded operators
on the space X⊙.
The inﬁnitesimal generator of T ⊙(t) is the operator denoted A⊙, which
is the restriction of A∗, to the domain
D(A⊙) =
&
x∗∈D(A∗) : A∗x∗∈X⊙'
D(A⊙) is weak* dense in X∗.One can repeat the construction starting
from X⊙and T ⊙(t), that is, we can the space X⊙∗from thee injection of
X⊙in X∗, we have X⊙∗contains X∗∗, with continuous injection. Since
X∗∗
contains X , X can be considedred as subspace of X⊙∗, and, in
addition X is a closed subspace of X⊙∗. By the same operations as above
we deﬁne X⊙⊙
X⊙⊙=
0
x⊙∗∈X⊙∗: lim
t→0
22T ⊙∗(t)x⊙∗−x⊙∗22 = 0
1
(2.5)
and T ⊙⊙(t) is the restriction of T ⊙∗(t) to X⊙⊙.
Deﬁnition: X is called sun-reﬂexive with respect to A if and only if
X = X⊙⊙.
remark 1 This equality should be understood as identiﬁcation : we no-
tice earlier that X can be identiﬁed to a closed subspace of X⊙∗. In the
case of sun-reﬂexivity this space X⊙⊙.
In the sun-reﬂexive case, we have: A⊙⊙= A and T ⊙⊙(t) = T(t).

2.1.1
The variation of constant formula:.
Given
a Ba-
nach space X , an operator A0 which is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a
C0−semigroup T0(t) We assume that X is sun reﬂexive with respect to
A0.Let be B ∈£(X⊙∗).
We consider the following equation
dx
dt = A0x(t) + Bx(t).
(2.6)
B is a perturbation of A0. At ﬁrst sight this pertubation doesnt make
sense since B takes values in a space bigger than X. The only way to
make it meaningful is to look for x(t) in a bigger space in fact in the
space X⊙∗. Assuming that x(t) lies in this space, one can write equation
(2.6) in the form
x(t) = T0(t)x0 +
 t
0
T ⊙∗
0 (t −s)Bx(s)ds
(2.7)
where x(0) = x0.
Using a method of successive approximations, one can show that the
equation (2.7) has each initial value x0 one and only one x(t) deﬁned
for all t ≥0. We denote T(t)x0 = x(t). T(t) is a semi-group strongly
continuous in X⊙∗.
We will now show that T(t) is a C0−semigroup on X. The proof goes
through the next lemma:
Lemma 18 Let f : [0, +∞[ →X⊙∗be norm-continuous. Then,
t →
 t

T ⊙∗
0 (t −s)f(s)ds

Theorem 1 Given
a Banach space X , an operator A0 which is the
inﬁnitesimal generator of a C0−semigroup T0(t) We assume that X is
sun reﬂexive with respect to A0.Let be B ∈L(X⊙∗). Then, equation2.7
has, for each x0 in X, a unique solution deﬁned on [0, +∞[ with values
in X, continuous and such that x(0) = x0. The map T(t)x0 = x(t) is
continuous on X.
Theorem 2 Under the same assumptions as the above theorem, let A
be the inﬁnitesimal generator of T(t). Then, we have
D(A) =

Variation Of Constant Formula Using
Integrated Semigroups Theory
In [4], [5], and [8] an approach has been developed, based on the
theory of integrated semigroups, for establishing a variation of constants
formula for functional diﬀerential equations in ﬁnite dimensional spaces.
This approach will be discussed in this section to obtain the variation of
constant formula for the following delay diﬀerential equations:
 dx
dt (t) = L(xt) + f(t),
t ≥0,
x0 = ϕ = C ([−r, 0] , Rn) ,
(3.10)
where xt denotes, as usual, the function deﬁned on [−r, 0] by xt(θ) =
x(t + θ), −R ≤θ ≤0, L is a continuous linear functional from C :=
C ([−r, 0] , Rn) into Rn and f is a function from [0, +∞[ into Rn. The
initial value problem associated with equation (3.10) is : given ϕ ∈C,

150
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
to ﬁnd a continuous function x : [−R, h[ →Rn, h > 0, diﬀerentiable on
[0, h[, satisfying equation (3.10) on [0, h[ .
We know that the solutions of the linear autonomous retarded func-
tional diﬀerential equation
 dx
dt (t) = L(xt), t ≥0,
x0 = ϕ,
(3.11)
in Rn, deﬁne a strongly continuous translation semigroup (T(t))t≥0 in
the space C := C ([−r, 0] , Rn) . The initial value problem associated with
equation (3.10) can be written formally as an integral equation
xt = T(t)ϕ +

T(t −s)X0f(s)ds, for t ≥0,
where X0 denotes the function deﬁned by X0(θ) = 0 if θ < 0 and
X0(0) = IdRn.
The expression T(·)X0 in the integral is not strictly deﬁned, since
X0 is not in C and T(·) acts on C. In this paper, we prove that the
semigroup (T(t))t≥0 associated to equation (3.10) can be extended to the
space C ⊕⟨X0⟩, where ⟨X0⟩= {X0c, c ∈Rn and (X0c) (θ) = X0(θ)c}
as an integrated semigroup of operators and we derive its consequences
regarding the nonhomogeneous linear equation (3.10) and the nonlinear
equation

Notations and basic results
We start by giving some basic terminology, deﬁnitions, and results
that will be needed in the sequel. The following deﬁnitions are due to
Arendt.
Deﬁnition 20 [9] Let X be a Banach space.
A family (S(t))t≥0 of
bounded linear operators S(t) on X is called an integrated semigroup if
the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) S(0) = 0;
(ii) for any x ∈X, S(t)x is a continuous function of t ≥0 with values
in X;
(iii) for any t, s ≥0
S(s)S(t) =

Deﬁnition 21 [9] An integrated semigroup (S(t))t≥0 is called exponen-
tially bounded, if there exist constants M ≥0 and ω ∈IR such that
∥S(t)∥≤Meωt for all t ≥0.
Moreover (S(t))t≥0 is called non-degenerate, if S(t)x = 0, for all t ≥0,
implies that x = 0.
If (S(t))t≥0 is an integrated semigroup exponentially bounded, then
the Laplace transform R(λ) := λ
 +∞

e−λtS(t)dt exists for all λ with
ℜe(λ) > ω, but R(λ) is injective if and only if (S(t))t≥0 is non-degenerate.
In this case R(λ) satisﬁes the following expression
R(λ) −R(µ) = (µ −λ)R(λ)R(µ),
and there exists a unique operator A satisfying (ω, +∞) ⊂ρ(A) (the
resolvent set of A) such that
R(λ) = (λI −A)−1, for all ℜe(λ) > ω.
The operator A is called the generator of (S(t))t≥0.
We have the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 22 [9] An operator A is called a generator of an integrated
semigroup, if there exists ω ∈IR such that ]ω, +∞[ ⊂ρ(A), and there ex-
ists a strongly continuous exponentially bounded family (S(t))t≥0 of lin-

An important special case is when the integrated semigroup is locally
Lipschitz, continuous..
Deﬁnition 23 [9]An integrated semigroup (S(t))t≥0 is called locally Lip-
schitz continuous if, for all τ > 0, there exists a constant k(τ) > 0 such
that
∥S(t) −S(s)∥≤k(τ) |t −s| , for all t, s ∈[0, τ] .
From [9], we know that every locally Lipschitz continuous integrated
semigroup is exponentially bounded.

152
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Deﬁnition 24 [9] We say that a linear operator A satisﬁes the Hille-
Yosida (HY ) condition, if there exists M > 0 and ω ∈IR such that
]ω, +∞[ ⊂ρ(A) and
sup

≤M.
The following theorem shows that the Hille-Yosida condition charac-
terizes generators of locally Lipschitz continuous integrated semigroups.
Theorem 3 [9] The following assertions are equivalent.
(i) A is the generator of a non-degenerate, locally Lipschitz continuous
integrated semigroup,
(ii)A satisﬁes the (HY ) condition .
In the sequel, we give some results for the existence of particulars
solutions of the following Cauchy problem
 du
dt (t) = Au(t) + f(t),
t ≥0,
u(0) = x ∈X,
(3.13)
where A satisﬁes the (HY ) condition.
Deﬁnition 25 [32] Given f ∈L1
loc(0, +∞; X) and x ∈X, we say that
u : [0, +∞[ →X is an integral solution of the equation ( 3.13) if the
following assertions are true
(i) u ∈C( [0, +∞[ ; X)

From this deﬁnition, we deduce that for an integral solution u, we

and f : [0, +∞[ →X is a continuous function. Then the problem ( 3.13)

The variation of constant formula
Let L be a linear bounded operator from C into Rn.
We consider
the linear functional diﬀerential equation (3.11). The following result is
known.
Theorem 5 [48]The operator Aϕ = ϕ′ with domain
D(A) =
&
ϕ ∈C1([−r, 0] ; Rn),
ϕ′(0) = L(ϕ)

is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup (T(t))t≥0
on C satisfying the translation property
(T(t)ϕ) (θ) =
3
ϕ(t + θ)
if t + θ ≤0
(T(t + θ)ϕ) (0) if t + θ > 0,
t ≥0, θ ∈[−r, 0] , ϕ ∈C.
Furthermore, for each ϕ ∈C, deﬁne x : [−r, +∞[ →Rn by
x(t) =
3
ϕ(t)
if t ∈[−r, 0]
(T(t)ϕ) (0) if t > 0.
Then x is the unique solution of ( 3.11) and T(t)ϕ = xt, for t ≥0.
For each complex number λ, we deﬁne the bounded linear operator
Lλ : Rn →Rn by
Lλ(c) = L(eλ.c),
for c ∈Rn,
where eλ.c : [−r, 0] →Rn is deﬁned by

Theorem 6 The continuous extension 5A of the operator A to the space
C ⊕⟨Xo⟩, deﬁned by
D( 5A) = C1 ([−r, 0] , Rn) , and 5Aϕ = ϕ′ + X0(L(ϕ) −ϕ′(0)),

It suﬃces to show that 5A satisﬁes the (HY ) condition .
By the Hille-Yosida theorem, there exists ω ∈lR, such that:
ρ(A) ⊃(ω, +∞)
sup
n∈N,λ>ω
{(λ −ω)n∥R(λ, A)n∥} < +∞
where R(λ, A) = (λI −A)−1 . In particular, for λ > ω, ∆(λ) is invertible
on L(Rn).
We need the following lemma.
Lemma 24 For λ > ω,
(i) D( 5A) = D(A) ⊕

eλ·∆−1(λ)c

,
for every (ϕ, c) ∈C × Rn.
Proof of lemma. We consider the following operator
l : D( 5A) →Rn
ψ →l(ψ) = ψ′(0) −L(ψ).
Let 5ψ ∈D( 5A) and λ > ω. If we put ψ = 5ψ −eλ·∆(λ)−1l( 5ψ), then we
deduce that ψ ∈Ker(l) = D(A), and the decomposition 5ψ = ψ + eλ.a,
with a ∈Rn, is unique.
Let 5ϕ ∈C ⊕⟨X0⟩, 5ϕ = ϕ + X0c. We look for 5ψ ∈D( 5A), such that
(λI −5A) 5ψ = 5ϕ.
5ψ can be written as 5ψ = ψ + eλ·a, where ψ ∈D(A) and a ∈Rn.
We have
(λI −5A)(ψ + eλ·a) = ϕ + X0c.
This equation splits into two
3
(λI −A)ψ = ϕ
∆(λ)a = c.

It follows that for λ > ω, (λI −5A)−1 exists and
(λI −5A)−1(ϕ + X0c) = (λI −A)−1ϕ + eλ·∆(λ)−1c.
Repeating this procedure, we have for every n ≥1
R(λ, 5A)n(ϕ + Xoc) = R(λ, A)nϕ + R(λ, A)n−1 

This completes the proof of the lemma.
On the other hand, one has

Without loss of generality, we can assume that λ > 0, in this case, we
have

sup
n∈N,λ>ω0
222(λ −ω0)n R(λ, 5A)n222 < ∞, where ω0 = max(∥L∥, ω).
We conclude by theorem 3, that 5A is the generator of a locally Lipschitz

(3.16)
Proof. It suﬃces to show that the function u deﬁned by

(3.17)
is an integral solution of equation (3.15).
Let x be the solution of (3.10), such that x0 = ϕ.
By using the relation

It follows that

We obtain that u is an integral solution of (3.15).

We know that equation (3.18) has one and only one solution x which

Substituting f(t, xt) for f(t) in formula 3.16, equation (3.18) can be

We deduce the following result.

Appendix
In this section, we prove that the integrated semigroup (S(t))t≥0 as-

S0(t −s)X0L(T(s)ϕ)ds,
t ≥0 and ϕ ∈C.
Proof.
For every function ϕ ∈C, consider the nonhomogenuous
Cauchy problem
 du
dt (t) = 5A0u(t) + h(t), for t ≥0
u(0) = 0,
(3.21)
where h : [0, +∞[ →C ⊕⟨X0⟩is given by
h(t) = ϕ + X0(L(S(t)ϕ).
In view of corollary 9 , 5A0 satisﬁes the (HY ) condition. Hence, by
theorem 4 the nonhomogeneous Cauchy problem (3.21) has an integral
solution u given by
u(t) = d

On the other hand, we have

This implies that

By applying

Hence, the function t →S(t)ϕ is an integral solution of (3.21).

Remark: 1) All results of this section can be obtained if we consider

2) The approach developed in the ﬁrst section, based on a certain
class of weakly * continuous semigroups on a dual Banach space (see
Clement et al.) ([27]), for the study of delay diﬀerential equations in

because we do not have necessarily C⊙⊙≃C.

Introduction
1.1
Statement of the Problem:
Consider the family of equations:
G(α, x) = 0
(1.1)
where
x ∈X , α ∈Λ, G : Λ × X →X ; X is a Banach space; Λ
is a topological space of parameters. Suppose that equation (1.1) has
for each α, a root translated to the origin x = 0, qualiﬁed as a trivial
solution, that we have G(α, 0) = 0
for each α ∈Λ.
The problem here is to determine non trivial solutions of (1.1).
Deﬁnition 26 We say that (α0, 0) is a bifurcating point of solutions of
( 1.1) if each neighborhood of (α0, 0) in Λ × X contains a point (α, x)
satisfying x ̸= 0 and G(α, x) = 0.
Deﬁnition 27 A bifurcation branch emanating from (α0, 0) is a map
b deﬁned from the interval I = [0, a[ ⊂IR into Λ × X such that b :
s →b(s) = (α(s), x(s)) satisfying x(s) ̸= 0 for s ̸= 0, lim
s→0x(s) = 0,
lim
s→0α(s) = α0,and G(α(s), x(s)) = 0.
- The graph of the map b is also called the bifurcating branch (or
branch of bifurcation).
- Λ × {0} is the trivial branch.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
- A bifurcation method is any method that could be used to exhibit
a branch of bifurcation for a family of equations.
Bifurcation theory studies persistence and exchange of qualitative
properties of dynamical systems under continuous perturbations. A typ-
ical case, which we will present here, is the case of systems depending
continuously on a single parameter. We will deal with retarded diﬀer-
ential equations of the form
dx(t)
dt
= F(α, xt)
(1.2)
with F : R × C →Rn, F of class C2 and F(α, 0) = 0 ∀α ∈R and C =
C([−r, 0] , Rn) the space of continuous functions from [−r, 0] into Rn. As
usual, xt is the function deﬁned from [−r, 0] into Rn by xt(θ) = x(t+θ)
, r ≥0 (r could be inﬁnite ).
We will be concerned with the nature of the equilibrium point 0 (stable
or unstable) with respect to the values of the parameter α. What happens
if at such a point α0, we observe a change in the stability (that is to say,
a transition from stability to instability when the system crosses the
value of the parameter α0).
Such a change may in fact correspond to important changes of the
dynamics.
Examples of systems depending on a parameter are abundant in physics,
chemistry, biology and...etc. Parameters can be the temperature, resis-
tance, reaction rate or the mortality rate, the birth rate, etc. Under
small variations of the parameter, such systems may lose stability, more
pecisely, the ”trivial” equilibrium may lose stability, and restabilize near
another equilibrium or a closed orbit or a larger attractor. The tran-
sition can be continuous, gentle and smooth, with the new equilibrium
state emerging in the vicinity of the ”trivial” one, or it can be of a dis-
continuous nature, with the new equilibrium being far from the ”trivial”
one. The ﬁrst case corresponds to a local bifurcation, the second one is
a global bifurcation.
In local bifurcations, one can distinguish two types of bifurcations:
I) the system leaves its equilibrium state and reaches a new ﬁxed
equilibrium state.
II) the system goes from an equilibrium state to an invariant sub-
set made generally of several equilibriums and curves connecting them,
closed orbits, or tori, etc. The most elementary situation is the Hopf
bifurcation, characterized by the onset of a closed orbit, starting near
the trivial equilibrium, which is the phase portrait of a periodic solution
with period close to some ﬁxed number (Hopf 1942).
In this course, we will restrict our attention to Hopf bifurcation.

Introduction to Hopf Bifurcation theory DDE
163
Deﬁnition 28 (α0, 0) ∈R × C is said to be a Hopf bifurcation point
for equation ( 1.2) if every neighbourhood of this point in R×C contains
a point (α, ϕ), with ϕ ̸= 0 such that ϕ is the initial data of a periodic
solution, with period near a ﬁxed positive number, of equation ( 1.2) for
the value of the parameter α.
We will now make the following assumptions:
(H0) F is of class Ck, for k ≥2, F(α, 0) = 0 for each α, and the map
(α, ϕ) →Dk
ϕF(α, ϕ) sends bounded sets into bounded sets.
(H1) The characteristic equation
det∆(α, λ) := λId −DϕF(α, 0) exp(λ(.)Id)
(1.3)
of the linearized equation of (1.2) around the equilibrium v = 0 :
dv(t)
dt
= DϕF(α, 0)vt
(1.4)
has in α = α0 ≥0 a simple imaginary root λ0 = λ(α0) = i , all the
others roots λ satisfy λ ̸= mλ0 for m = 0, ±2, ±3, ±4, ...
((H1) implies notably that the root λ0 lies on a branch of roots λ =
λ(α) of equation (1.3), of class Ck−1)
(H2) λ(α) being the branch of roots passing through λ0, we have
∂
dαℜeλ(α) |α=α0̸= 0
(1.5)
Theorem 1 Under the assumptions (H0), (H1) and (H2), there exist
constants R, δ > 0, and η > 0 and functions α(c), ω(c) and a periodic
function with period ω(c), u∗(c), such that a) All of these functions are of
class C1 with respect to c, for c ∈[0, R[,α(0) = α0, ω(0) = ω0, u∗(0) = 0
; b) u∗(c) is a periodic solution of ( 1.2), for the parameter value equal
α(c) and period ω(c); c) For | α −α0 |< δ and | ω −2π |< η, any ω−
periodic solution p, with ∥p∥< R, of ( 1.2) for the parameter value α,
there exists c ∈[0, R[ such α = α(c), ω = ω(c) and p is, up to a phase
shift, equal to u∗(c).
1.2
History of the problem
1.2.1
The Case of ODEs:.
A bifurcation result similar to
theorem1 was ﬁrst established by Hopf (Hopf (1942), Absweigung einer
periodischen l¨osung eines diﬀerential systems. Berichen Math. Phys.
Ki. S¨ach. Akad. Wiss Leipzig 94, 1-22) in the case of ODE, assuming
that the function is analytic with respect to both the state variable and
the parameter. Hopf obtained α(c), ω(c) and u∗(c) analytic in c at 0.

164
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In the seventies, Hsu and Kazarinoﬀ, Poore, Marsden and McCracken
(1976) and others discuss in their works the computation of important
features of the Hopf bifurcation, especially the direction of bifurcation
and dynamical aspects (stability, attractiveness, etc), both from theo-
retical and numerical standpoints. A very important new achievement
was the proof by Alexander and Yorke of what is known as the global
Hopf bifurcation theorem, which roughly speaking describes the extent
of the branch. The theory was also extended towards allowing further
degeneracies (more than two eigenvalues crossing theimaginary axis, or
multiplicity higher than one, etc) leading notably to the development
of the generalized Hopf bifurcation theory (Bernfeld et al (1980, 1982),
Negrini and Salvadori (1978), M.L. Hbid (Th`ese de Doctorat 1987)).
After the work done in the seventies, one might consider that the
Hopf bifurcation theory for ODEs is essentially closed (proof of theorem
of existence of periodic solutions, computation of direction of bifurcation,
estimation of elements of bifurcation, stability of the bifurcating branch).
1.2.2
The case of Delay Equations:.
- Chafee in 1971 was
the ﬁrst to prove the local Hopf bifurcation theorem for DDE. Chafee’s
theorem gives both existence and stability: for this, it is necessary to
make further assumptions in addition to the extension of the conditions
stated in the Hopf bifurcation theorem for ODEs. The ﬁrst proof of a
stricto sensu extension of the Hopf bifurcation theorem to DDE is at-
tributed, in historical notes of Hale’s book, to Chow and Mallet-Paret
(1974). It is probably right to say that the machinery, at the functional
analytic level, that was necessary for such an extension, was there, ready
to be used, by the beginning of the seventies, and was indeed used in-
dependently by several groups, here and there. I will now quote some
of the work done starting in the mid-seventies. This list should not be
considered exhaustive in whatever way:
- Hale in his book (1977) gives a proof of the theorem (1), based on
some of his earlier work in the case of ODE.
- Chow and Mallet-Paret (1978) use the averaging method to deter-
mine the stability and the amplitude of the bifurcating periodic orbit.
- Arino (1980 ) (not published) discusses one of the issues entailed
by DDEs, namely a lack of regularity when the parameter is the delay.
This problem shows up notably in the ﬁxed point formulation for the
determination of periodic solutions. The method elaborated in Arino
(1980) goes through the adaptation of the implicit function theorem.
- Schumacher(1982) proves the Hopf bifurcation theorem for a strongly
continuous nonlinear semigroup deﬁned in a closed subset of a Banach
space.

Introduction to Hopf Bifurcation theory DDE
165
- Stech (1985) uses the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and gen-
eralizes a proof given by De Oliveira and Hale (1980) in the case of
ODEs to inﬁnite delay diﬀerential equations. He also gives a compu-
tational scheme of bifurcation elements via an asymptotic expansion of
the bifurcation function.
- Staﬀans (1987) shows the theorem in a case analogous to Stech’s in
the case of neutral functional diﬀerential equations. His method is based
on the Lyapunov -Schmidt reduction method.
- Diekmann and van Gils (1990) reformulate the problem as an integral
equation. Using the theory of perturbation by duality, these authors
prove a centre manifold theorem for DDE and deduce the existence of
bifurcating periodic solutions via a reduction on centre manifold.
- Adimy (1991) proves the Hopf bifurcation theorem using the inte-
grated semigroup theory.
- Talibi (1992) uses an approximation method to obtain the existence
of periodic solutions.
- M.L. Hbid (1993) uses a reduction principle to a centre manifold,
the Lyapunov direct method and the Poincar´e procedure to prove the
theorem.
- T.Faria and L.Magalhaes (1995) extend the normal form theory to
DDE and apply the theory to Hopf bifurcations of such equations.
In a more recent past, the Hopf bifurcation theory has been considered
in the case of functional partial diﬀerential equations, delay diﬀerential
equations in inﬁnite dimensional spaces. This subject will be presented
in T.Faria’s lectures. The theory has also been extended to the case of
diﬀerential equations with state-dependent delay.
The following statement of the local Hopf bifurcation theorem is given
by J.Hale
Theorem 2 (J.K. Hale, Theory of functional diﬀerential equations, 1977)
Suppose F(α, φ) has continuous ﬁrst and second derivatives with respect
to α, φ, F(α, 0) = 0 for all α, and Hypothesis (H1) and (H2) are sat-
isﬁed.
Then there are constants a0 > 0, α0 > 0, δ0 > 0, functions
α(a) ∈R, ω(a) ∈R, and an ω(a)−periodic function x∗(a), with all
functions being continuously diﬀerentiable in a for |a| < a0, such that
x∗(a) is a solution of equation ( 1.2) with
x∗
0(a)Nα = Φα(a)y∗(a),
x∗
0(a)Qα = z∗
0(a)
(1.6)
where y∗(a) = (a, 0)T + o(|a|), z∗
0(a) = o(|a|) as |a| →0. Furthermore,
for |α| near 0 and |ω −2π| < δ0, every ω−periodic solution of equation
( 1.2) with |xt| < δ0 must be of the type exact for a translation in phase.

166
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The approach we want to illustrate is based on two steps: ﬁrst, a
reduction to a centre manifold, where the DDE reduces to an ODE; then,
the study of the bifurcation of periodic solutions on the reduced system.
For the reduction, we have followed the approach of Diekmann and van
Gils (1991), which itself is an adaptation to DDE of a method originally
proposed by Vanderbauwhede in the context of ODE. Once reduction
has been obtained, one has the problem of investigating the dynamics
near a critical point: nonlinearities play a crucial role there, and the
diﬃculty lies in the fact that the nonlinearities are only known implicitly.
The method we present here consists in computing a Lyapunov function
using the Poincar´e procedure.

Bifurcation: The Case Of Ode
Before discussing the behavior of the reduced ordinary diﬀerential
system (3.28), let us recall the framework of the generalized Hopf bifur-

For every ρ0 ∈[0, a[ , θ0 ∈R, the orbit of (2.7) passing through

a ∈[0, a[ and µ are suﬃciently small, then for any µ ∈]−µ, µ[ and
c ∈[0, a[ the solution of (2.11) exists in[0, 2π]. This solution will be

Let us ﬁrst very brieﬂy draw the perspective of the center manifold
theorem. Consider a general nonlinear DDE
dx
dt = f(p, xt),
in which p represents a parameter (possibly, a vector). Assuming that
f(p, 0) = 0
for all p in a given region, the local behavior of the solutions near 0 is

which can itself be described in terms of the characteristic equation
(providing the eigenvalues of the inﬁnitesimal generator of the linear
equation)
det(λI −Dϕf(p, 0)(exp(λ.) ⊗I)) = 0.
In the hyperbolic case, that is to say, as long as the equation has no
root with zero real part, solutions which remain close enough to the
origin either approach the origin at +∞or escape from the origin. In
particular, no periodic solution can be found in the vicinity of the origin
in this situation. This scenario, well known in the case of ODE, has been
extended to many inﬁnitely dimensional cases, including DDE. It is a
consequence of the so-called saddle-point theorem which can be found,
for example, in Hale’s books on DDE. We are concerned here with the
non hyperbolic case, that is, the situation that arises when for some
p = π⊙∗
c , the characteristic equation has a root with zero real part.
Amongst the rich variety of cases, we choose one of the two simplest
ones: we assume that at p0, the characteristic equation has a pair of
imaginary roots, each simple, and no other multiple of these numbers
(including 0) is a root of the equation.
To be more speciﬁc, we will consider the following example, the scalar
delay diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = f(b, ε, xt),
(3.14)
where
f(b, ε, ϕ) = −bϕ(−1) + ε(ϕ(−1))3 + o(ϕ3),
b and ε are two real parameters, b > 0, b >> |ε| . The vector of parame-
ters is p = (b, ε). Equation (3.14) is an example of equations that has
been considered by many authors. An example of such an equation is
the logistic delay equation in the case of an odd nonlinearity
dx
dt = x(t)1 −x(t −1)
1 + x(t −1)

If y is a solution of (3.18) on an interval ]−∞, σ + 1[ then we let yt for
each t ∈(−∞, σ) designate the element of E∗deﬁned by
yt(s) = y(s + t) for 0 ≤s ≤1.
We know that if x is a solution of (3.15) on τ −1 < t < +∞and y is a
solution of (3.18) on (−∞, σ + 1) with σ > τ, then (yt, xt) is a constant
on [τ, σ].

3.2
The center manifold theorem
Here, we go through the derivation of the centre manifold made by
Diekmann and van Gils. There is part of the method which is general
and follows in fact the approach by Vanderbauwhede, and part which
is implicated by the delay: essentially, the treatment of the variation of
constant formula using the sun-star extension. I will ﬁrst state the basic
problem, taking a general equation:
dx
dt = Lxt + F(xt)
(3.21)
We assume that F is smooth, F(0) = 0, DF(0) = 0. Moreover, I assume
that the linear part L has only a stable and a center part, which leads
to a decomposition of the state space
E = EC ⊕ES
which corresponds to
I = πC + πS.
Using the variation of constants formula, equation (3.21) reads as
xt = T(t)ϕ +

T ⊙∗(t −s)F(xs)ds
which decomposes onto the subspaces Ec and Es as follows

πST ⊙∗(t −s)F(xs)ds.

Introduction to Hopf Bifurcation theory DDE

Letting σ →−∞, the term TS(t −σ) (xσ)S approaches 0, while the
integral has a limit, which yields an expression where the projection ϕS
has been eliminated
πS(xt) =

In fact, the above formulas are not correct, the projector πC is deﬁned
on E, thus it is necessary to extend it to the space EC in order to use it in
the above expressions. The fact that it can be done in some natural way
is proved in the paper by Diekmann and van Gils, who use the following
formula, (with the notation π⊙∗

Note that π⊙∗

fact, it has the same range as πC. In order to set up the full equation for
the center manifold, there are still two steps: 1) localizing the equation
using a truncation; 2) choosing a suitable state space in which the ﬁxed
point problem deﬁned by (3.24) makes sense.

We may observe that the right hand side of the above formula is equal
to P0ϕ, which, on the other hand, can be represented in terms of the
formal dual product using formula (3.23). Therefore, we have
π⊙∗
c (0, ϕ) = (ψ1, ϕ)ϕ1 + (ψ2, ϕ)ϕ2, such that ϕ(0) = 0.
Since the space IE0 = {ϕ ∈E, ϕ(0) = 0} is dense in L1([−1, 0], R), the
above formula holds for any (0, ϕ) ∈E⊙∗. Combining the above two
results, we deduce that for any (β, h) ∈E⊙∗we have :
π⊙∗
c (β, h) = (ψ1, (β, h))ϕ1 + (ψ2, (β, h))ϕ2,
where <, > is the extension of the formal dual product given by formula
(3.17).The proof of Proposition 33 is complete.
The spectrum σ(A) is a pure point spectrum. Ec is a two dimensional
space on which T ⊙∗(t) can be extended to a group on R. Moreover the

there exists a positive constant k = k(β) such that

For υ ∈]0, −γ[, we deﬁne G from BCν(R, R2 × IE) × (R2 × Ec) into

Deﬁnition 33 [33] The centre manifold Wc is the image of the map

then equation (3.33) may be written in the form:

A natural candidate to be the principal part of system (3.39) is the
system
Proposition 30 The origin z = 0 of ( 3.40) is 3-asymptotically stable
if ε > 0 (3-completely-unstable if ε < 0).
Before we proceed to the proof of proposition 4.2, let us derive its
consequences on equation (3.14).
Corollary 5 The origin of equation ( 3.14).is asymptotically stable if
ε > 0 and unstable if ε < 0.
Proof of Corollary 5
Equation (3.39) is a perturbation of order o(∥z ∥3) of equation (3.40).
Therefore, it enjoys the same stability properties as equation (3.40),
when the latter is either 3-asymptotically stable or 3-completely unsta-
ble. Since equation (3.39) is the reduced equation of equation (3.14) on
the centre manifold we deduce from the fundamental centre manifold
theorem that the two equations have the same stability properties, that
is the origin of (3.14).is asymptotically stable if ε > 0 and unstable if
ε < 0.
Proof of Proposition 4.2
Proving that the origin of (3.40) is 3-asymptotically stable (resp.
3-
completely-unstable) is equivalent to determining a Lyapunov function
F of the form
F(z1, z2) = z2

We observe that G4 (ε) < 0 if ε > 0 and G4 (ε) > 0 if ε < 0. This means
that system (3.40) is 3-asymptotically stable if ε > 0 and 3-completely

Remark 4.2
System (3.39) is a perturbation of system (3.40).
From Proposition
30 and generalized Hopf bifurcation theorem, Theorem 3, we can only
concude that system (3.39) has no more than one periodic solution.
Because the linear part of this system is independant of the parameter
ε, the condition given in terms of the sign of α (µ) Gh (see Theorem 3)
is not fulﬁled.

In the last section, f′′(0) = 0.
If we use the method developed before. The presence of a quadratic
term in equation (4.47) creates an additional diﬃculty compared to the
situation dealt with in the last section, also in several other works where
it is assumed that the nonlinearity is odd. The determination of the
Lyapunov function leads us to give an explicit approximation of the
homogeneous part of degree two of the local center manifold near zero
associated to equation (4.47) for the value γ = π
2 .
It is also possible to extend the procedure to compute a center mani-
fold for a general autonomous functional diﬀerential equation.

Approximation of a local center manifold
Let us now brieﬂy describe what the local center manifold theorem
tells us. For the most recent and satisfactory presentation of this result,
we refer to Diekmann and van Gils [33]. So, equation (4.47) has a local
center manifold

that Dh(0) = 0, and of course h(0) = 0. The Taylor expansion of h near

The ﬁrst property of a center manifold is that it is invariant with respect
to the original semiﬂow. So, if z is a solution of equation (3.19), then,
the function t −→Φz (t)+h (z (t)) is a solution of equation (4.47). This,
in particular, implies that it veriﬁes the translation property, for each
t ∈[0, 1] and θ ∈[−1, −t] (ie : t + θ ≤0),
Φ (θ) z (t) + h (z (t)) (θ) = Φ (t + θ) ξ + h (ξ) (t + θ) .

By diﬀerentiating equation (4.53) with respect to t and rearranging

(4.55)
On the other hand, the local semi ﬂow t −→Φz (t) + h (z (t)) generated
by the delay equation (4.47) with γ = π
2 on the center manifold is
diﬀerentiable at t = 0. So,

Then, if we note that g2 (x) = αx2, conditions (4.50) and (4.51) follow
respectively from (4.57) and (4.58).
Remark We already know that (a, b, c) are unique as coeﬃcients of
the quadratic part of the Taylor expansion of h. However, it is not ob-
vious from the beginning that the system of equations (4.50) and (4.51)
they satisfy determines these coeﬃcients in a unique way. The following
proposition provides us with uniqueness of the solution of that system
of equations.
Proposition 32 The solution of the ordinary diﬀerential equation ( 4.50)
with the boundary conditions ( 4.51) is unique.

where
S (θ) =

Proof : By virtue of proposition 33, it follows that, if β = 0, the
system (4.62) is 3-asymptotically stable if G3 (ε, α) < 0 ( in other words
if (ε, α) ∈S1). Hence, by the generalized Hopf bifurcation theorem 3,
there exists r0 = r0 (ε, α) > 0 and
β0 = β0 (ε, α) > 0 such that the
system (4.48) has exactly one periodic solution in B (0, r0) if
Reλ (β, α, ε) G3 (ε, α) < 0,
(4.68)
where Reλ (β, α, ε) is the real part of the two eigenvalues of the linear
part of (4.62) . However, Reλ (β, α, ε) = 1
2µ0πβ, then, relation (4.68) is
equivalent to βG3 (ε, α) < 0,which completes the proof of the ﬁrst asser-
tion .
The proof of the second assertion is similar. In fact, by theorem 3, there
exists r0 = r0 (ε, α) > 0 and β0 = β0 (ε, α) > 0 such that the system
(4.48) has no periodic solution in B (0, r0) if Reλ (β, α, ε) G3 (ε, α) >
0.However, sign (Reλ (β, α, ε)) = sign (β) ,which yields the second as-
sertion.
In conclusion, we can state as a corollary the following immediate
consequences of theorem 9 regarding the direction of bifurcation.
Corollary 10 Assume that hypothesis (H) is satisﬁed. Then, the bifur-
cation of nontrivial periodic solutions of (4.47) arising from γ = π
2 is
i) subcritical if ε < 0 and |α| is small enough.
ii) supercritical if either ε < 0 and |α| is larger than some value, or
ε < 0 and for all α.
Thus, the quadratic term pushes the bifurcation to the right, no mat-
ter its sign is. Subcriticality is caused by the cubic term and occurs only
when the coeﬃcient of this term is negative and large enough in absolute
value.
Similar computations have been performed in the case γ < 0 (that is,
positive feedback). There is little change in the formulae, for example,
bifurcation occurs at γ = −3π
2 . The results on the direction of bifurca-
tion are as follows : the quadratic term acts in the same way as in the
negative feedback case, while the cubic term has an opposite eﬀect.

Introduction
Normal forms theory is one of the most powerful tools in the study
of nonlinear dynamical systems, in particular, for stability and bifurca-
tion analysis. In the context of ﬁnite-dimensional ordinary diﬀerential
equations (ODEs), this theory can be traced back to the work done a
hundred years ago by Poincar´e [14]. The basic idea of normal form con-
sists of employing successive, near-identity, nonlinear transformations,
which leads us to a diﬀerential equation in a simpler form, qualitatively
equivalent to the original system in the vicinity of a ﬁxed equilibrium
point, thus hopefully greatly simplifying the dynamical analysis.

Concerning functional diﬀerential equations (FDEs), the principal dif-
ﬁculty in developing normal form theory is the fact that the phase space
is not ﬁnite dimensional. The ﬁrst work in this direction, in such a way
to overcome this diﬃculty, is due to T. Faria et al. [44]. In that paper,
the authors have considered an FDE as an abstract ODE in an adequate
inﬁnite-dimensional phase space which was ﬁrst presented in the work
of Chow and Mallet-Paret [30]. This inﬁnite dimensional ODE is then
handled in a similar way as in the ﬁnite dimensional case, and through
a recursive process of nonlinear transformations, the authors in [44] suc-
ceeded to a simpler inﬁnite dimensional ODE so deﬁned as normal form
of the original FDE. One of [44]′s proposal is that, for fear of loosing
the explicit relationships between the coeﬃcients in the normal form ob-
tained and the coeﬃcients in the original FDE, their method provides

194
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
us an eﬃcient algorithm for approximating normal forms for an FDE
directly without computing beforehand a local center manifold near the
singularity. However, by expliciting steps of the algorithm given in [4],
we will show that the known of Taylor coeﬃcients of the center mani-
fold is necessary for the algorithm to go on. This point of view will be
presented in detail later.
The issue of this chapter is to present a new, eﬃcient and algorithmic
formulation of the problem of computing local center manifolds and nor-
mal forms associated to an FDE. The problem have been considered in
the previous papers [2] and [1], but only in approximating local center
manifold associated to an FDE with special singularities (namely Hopf
and Bogdanov-Takens singularities). In this work, we are concerned with
FDEs having a general singularity. We assume that the existence of a
local center manifold is ensured by ﬁnitely many eigenvalues with zero
real part.The result generalizes singularities considered in both of the
works [2] and [1]. Our motivations for this work are two folds. First, we
derive an algorithmic scheme which allows us, by means of a recursive
procedure, to compute at each step the term of order k ≥2 of the Taylor
expansion of a local center manifold : In fact, we prove that the coef-
ﬁcients of the homogeneous part of degree k of a local center manifold
satisfy an initial value problem in ﬁnite dimension, whose parameters
depend only on terms of the same order in the considered FDE and the
terms of lower order of a local center manifold already computed. Note
that the computation of Taylor expansion is, in most cases, the only in-
formation that can be extracted at the expense of nontrivial algorithmic
procedures. Secondly, we present an algorithm which provides us, in a
recursive way, with the normal form of an FDE. This is accomplished in
three steps. In the ﬁrst step we consider the reduced system on a known
local center manifold for which an algorithmic scheme is developed. This
gives us idea about information needed from a local center manifold in
order to compute terms of the normal form for the reduced system. This
allows, in the second step, a simpler scheme that greatly saves compu-
tational times and computation memory. Finally, in the third step we
present a direct computing scheme of normal forms for FDEs (in the
sense of the deﬁnition given in [44]).
The chapter is organized as follows: The preliminary section 2 pro-
vides us with elementary notions and a background about the theory of
FDEs (for more details see [58]). In section 3, we state a result which
gives us an analytic characterization of a local center manifold. This
characterization is then explored to derive a computational scheme of a
local center manifold, and we consider some applications of the compu-
tation of center manifolds to the special cases of the Hopf singularity and

Bogdanov Takens singularity respectively.We reminder the reader that
a concrete example relatedb to the Hopf singularity had been discussed
in the last chapter. An example related to the Bogdanov Taknes singu-
larity is given in the end of this section.. Section 4 details the normal
form construction for both of the reduced system and the original FDE.
2.
Notations and background
In this section, we refer the reader to [53] for notations and general
results on the theory of FDEs in ﬁnite dimension spaces. Let r ≥0
and n ∈N. We denote by C = C ([−r, 0] , Rn) the Banach space of
continuous functions from [−r, 0] to Rn endowed with the supremum
norm ∥φ∥=
sup
θ∈[−r,0]
|φ (θ)| , for φ ∈C. If u is a continuous function
taking [σ −r, σ + a] into Rn, then we denote by ut the element of C
deﬁned by ut (θ) = u (t + θ) , for every θ ∈[−r, 0] and t ∈[σ, σ + a] .
Our main concern throughout this paper is with the autonomous FDE
of the form
du (t)
dt
= Lut + f (ut)
(2.1)
where L is a bounded linear operator from C into Rnand f is a suf-
ﬁciently smooth function mapping C into Rn such that f (0) = 0 and
Df (0) = 0 (Df denotes the Fr´echet derivative of f). A solution u =
u (φ) of (1) through a point φ in C is a continuous function taking
[−r, a) , into Rn such that x0 = φ and satisfying (1) for t in (0, a) . Note
that the Riesz representation allows us to represent the operator L as
L (φ) =
 0
−r
dη (θ) φ (θ)
where η is an n × n matrix valued function of bounded variation
in
θ ∈[−r, 0].
Together with (1) , we consider the linearized equation near zero
du (t)
dt
= Lut
(2.2)
If we denote by u (., φ) the unique solution of equation (2.2) with initial
function φ at zero, then equation (2.2) determines a C0-semigroup of
bounded linear operators given by
T (t) φ = ut (., φ) ,
for t ≥0
where u is the solution of (2.2) with u0 = φ. Denote by A the inﬁnites-
imal generator of (T (t))t≥0 . It is known that the spectrum σ (A) of A

196
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
coincides with its point spectrum σp (A) and it consists of those λ ∈C
which satisfy the characteristic equation
p (λ) = det∆(λ) = 0
(2.3)
where ∆(λ) = λIRn −
 0
−r eλθdη (θ) .
Let m ∈N be the number of solutions of (2.3) with zero real part,
counting their multiplicities. Denote by Λ = {λi, i = 1, ..., m} this set
of eigenvalues. Throughout this paper, we assume that the following
hypothesis holds:
(H)
Λ ̸= ∅.
Using the formal adjoint theory of Hale [53], the phase space C is de-
composed by Λ as
C = PΛ ⊕QΛ,
where PΛ is the m dimensional generalized eigenspace associated to ele-
ments of Λ and QΛ is its unique T (t) invariant complement subspace in
C. If we denote by Φ = (φ1, φ2, ...., φm) a basis of PΛ, the subspace PΛ
is then written as
PΛ = {Φx : x ∈Rm} .
Moreover, according to the hypothesis (H) , there exists a matrix B of
the form
B =

(2.4)
with σi ∈{0, 1} such that the semi-ﬂow generated by (2.2) restricted to
PΛ is a linear ODE whose matrix is exactly B. To explicit the subspace
QΛ and the projection operator associated with the above decomposition
of C we need to deﬁne the so called adjoint bilinear form as
⟨ψ, ϕ⟩= ψ (0) ϕ (0) −

ψ (s −θ) dη (θ) ϕ (s) ds, for ϕ ∈C and ψ ∈C∗
(2.5)
where C∗= C ([0, r] , Rn∗) and Rn∗is the n-dimensional space of
row vectors.
With the this bilinear form we can compute the basis
Ψ = col (ψ1, ψ2, ...., ψm) of the dual space P ∗
Λ in C∗such that ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩=
(⟨ψi, φj⟩)0≤i,j≤m = IRn. and, the subspace QΛ is given in a compact
form:
QΛ = {φ ∈C : ⟨Ψ, φ⟩= col(⟨ψ1, φ⟩, ...., ⟨ψm, φ⟩) = 0} .

Now consider the nonlinear equation (2.1) . Using the variation of con-
stants formula given in [53], a solution of (2.1) is given by
ut = T (t) u0 +
 t
0
T (t −s) X0f (us) ds,
for t ≥0
where X0 = X0 (θ) is deﬁned by
X0 (θ) =
3
IRn
for θ = 0
0
for θ ∈[−r, 0[
According to the decomposition of C endowed by the set Λ of eigen-
values, the solution ut given above may be decomposed as ut = Φx (t) +
y (t) , where x (t) is an element of Rm and y (t) ∈QΛ. It is important
to observe that in general y (t) does not satisfy the translation property
(ie y (t) (θ) = y (t + θ) (0)).
By the use of a ﬁxed point theorem, the authors in [53] have considered
equation (2.1) for which they proved that, under hypothesis (H) , we
have the existence of a local center manifold. This tool allows us to
give a complete description of the local dynamics of equation (2.1) near
the steady state: more precisely, the behavior of orbits of (2.1) in C
can be completely described by the restriction of the ﬂow to a local
center manifold associated with Λ, which is necessarily an m-dimensional
ODE. Note that the lack of uniqueness makes local center manifolds
hard to determine. However, fortunately, the uniqueness of the Taylor
expansion of these manifolds is ensured. After computing the Taylor
expansion of a center manifold up to an order k, the nonlinear term of
the reduced system can be explicitly computed up to the order k + 1.
The classical deﬁnition of a local center manifold associated with the set
Λ of eigenvalues in the imaginary axis is given as:
Deﬁnition 34 : Given a C1map h from Rm into QΛ, the graph of h is
said to be a local center manifold associated with equation (1) if and only
if h (0) = 0, Dh (0) = 0 and there exists a neighborhood V of zero in Rm
such that, for each z ∈V, there exists δ = δ (ξ) > 0 and the solution x
of (2.1) with initial data Φz + h (z) exists on the interval ]−δ −r, δ[ and
it is given by
ut = Φx (t) + h (x (t)) , for t ∈[0, δ[ ,
where x (t) is the unique solution of the ordinary diﬀerential equation

with B is the matrix deﬁned in (2.4) . The ODE (2.6) is said to be the
reduced system of (2.1).
Geometrically speaking, a local center manifold is the graph of a given
function mapping a neighborhood of zero in PΛ into QΛ which is tangent
to PΛ and locally invariant under the semi-ﬂow generated by equation
(2.1) .
In [44], the authors have presented a method for computing normal
forms for FDEs.
To develop a normal form theory for FDEs, it was
necessary, in the ﬁrst step, to enlarge the phase space C in such a way
that (2.1) is written as an abstract ODE. The adequate phase space
for this situation is the one introduced in [55] and used in [28] for the
application of averaging methods to FDEs. It is exactly the space BC
of the functions from [−r, 0] into Rn uniformly continuous on [−r, 0[
and with a jump discontinuity at 0. In terms of the function X0 deﬁned
previously, an element ψ ∈BC can be written as ψ = φ + X0α where
φ ∈C and α ∈Rn. Also, if we identify the space BC to C × Rn then it
can be endowed with the norm
∥φ + X0α∥BC = ∥φ∥C + ∥α∥Rn
to be a Banach space. The abstract ODE in BC associated with the
FDE (2.1) can be written in the form
du (t)
dt
= 5Au (t) + X0f (u (t))
(2.7)
where 5Aφ = φ′+X0 [Lφ −φ′ (0)] with D

5A

= C1. The bilinear form in
C∗×C deﬁned in (2.5) can be extended in a natural way to C∗×BC by
⟨Ψ, X0⟩= Ψ (0) , and consequently, we can deﬁne the projection operator
π : BC −→PΛ such that
π (φ + X0α) = Φ [⟨Ψ, φ⟩+ Ψ (0) α]
for every φ ∈C and α ∈Rn
leading to the decomposition
BC = PΛ ⊕Ker (π)
Let u be a solution of (2.7). According to the above decomposition of
BC, the solution u can be written
u (t) = Φx (t) + y (t)

In applications, we are particularly interested in obtaining normal
forms for equations giving the ﬂow on local center manifolds. In the
context of FDEs, typical equations to be considered for the computation
of normal forms read as
•x = Bx + Ψ (0) f (Φx + h (x)) ,
(2.9)
where h is a local center manifold.
3.
Computational scheme of a local center
manifold
In this section, we derive, at ﬁrst, necessary and suﬃcient analytic
conditions on a given function h under which its graph is a local center
manifold of (2.1). This will be exploited in the second step to develop
the computational scheme of terms in the Taylor expansion of h.
Theorem 1 Let h be a map from Rm into QΛ with h (0) = 0 and
Dh (0) = 0. A necessary and suﬃcient conditions on the graph of h to
be a local center manifold of equation (2.1) is that there exists a neigh-
borhood V of zero in Rm such that, for each z ∈V, we have
∂
∂θ (h (z)) (θ)
=

∂h (z)
∂z
(θ)

[Bz + Ψ (0) f (Φz + h (z))]
+Φ (θ) Ψ (0) f (Φz + h (z)) .
(3.10)
and
∂h (z)
∂θ
(0) = Lh (z) + f (Φz + h (z)) ,
(3.11)
where z (t) is the unique solution of (2.6) .
Proof. Necessity : If h is a local center manifold of equation (2.1),
then, there exists a neighborhood V of zero in R2 such that, for each

200
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ξ ∈V, there exists δ = δ (ξ) > 0 such that the solution of (2.1) with
initial data Φξ + h (ξ) exists on the interval ]−δ −r, δ[ and it is given by
xt = Φz (t) + h (z (t)) , for t ∈]−δ, δ[ .
The relations
Φ (θ) z (t) + h (z (t)) (θ) = Φ (t + θ) ξ + h (ξ) (t + θ) , for t + θ ≤0 and 0 ≤t < δ,
(3.12)
and
Φ (θ) z (t) + h (z (t)) (θ) = Φ (0) z (t + θ) + h (z (t + θ)) (0) ,
for t + θ ≥0 and 0 ≤t < δ
(3.13)
are immediately deduced from the translation property of the semi-ﬂow
t −→xt = Φz (t) + h (z (t)) generated by equation (2.1) in a local center
manifold. Moreover, this semi-ﬂow has a backward extension to ]−δ, 0].
Then, it follows from (3.13) that
L (Φξ + h (ξ)) + f (Φξ + h (ξ))
=
ΦBξ + ∂h (ξ)
∂θ
(0) ,
(3.14)
so, by using the proporety LΦξ = ΦBξ, the relation (3.11) follows
immediately.
On the other hand, for t > 0, by diﬀerentiating relation (3.12) with
respect to t, we get
Φ (t + θ) Bξ + ∂
∂θ (h (ξ)) (t + θ) =

Φ (θ) + ∂h (z (t))

[Bξ + Ψ (0) f (Φξ + h (ξ))]
+Φ (θ) [Ψ (0) f (Φξ + h (ξ))] .
(3.15)
Suﬃciency : From the formulae (3.12) and (3.13) , one can see that
there exists a continuous function y : ]δ −r, δ[ −→Rn such that
yt = Φz (t) + h (z (t)) , for t ∈]−δ, δ[ .

Letting ξ = z (t) and θ = 0 in (3.15) and substituting ∂

d

(3.17)
where L and D are bounded linear operators from C into Rn; F and G
are suﬃciently smooth functions mapping C into Rn such that F (0) =
G (0) = 0 and F ′ (0) = G′ (0) = 0 ( F ′ and G′ denote the Frechet
derivative of F and G respectively ), the analytic characterization of a

Formulation of the scheme
Now we are in position to derive our algorithmic scheme for approxi-
mating a local center manifold associated with (2.1) . To this end consider
the analytic characterization given in the above Theorem. Without loss
of generality we can assume that h and f can be written respectively in
the form:
h (z) =

j≥2
hj (z)
(3.18)
and
f (φ) =

j≥2
fj (φ)
(3.19)
The term hj (z) denotes the homogeneous part of degree j with respect
to z of h.
In the sequel of this work we adopt the following notation : for j ∈N
and Y a normed space, V m
j
(Y ) denotes the space of homogeneous poly-
nomials of degree j in m variables z = (z1, z2, . . . , zm) with coeﬃcients
in Y. In other words
V m
j
(Y ) =




|q|=j

where |q| = m
i=1 qi. Moreover, we denote by Dm
j the set of parameters
deﬁned as

q = (q1, q2, . . . , qm) ∈Nm : |q| =


i=1

endowed with the following order : for q = (q1, q2, . . . , qm) and p =
(p1, p2, . . . , pm) in Dm
j , we have p < q if the ﬁrst non-zero diﬀerence
p1 −q1, p2 −q2, . . . , pm −qm is positive. Hence, the space Dm
j reads

where j = card

and q(m,j,1) < q(m,j,2) < · · · < q(m,j,j).
The goal now is to develop our algorithmic scheme for computing, in
a recursive way, the polynomial (hj)j≥2 . We will show that at the step
k ≥2, the term hk ∈V m
k (QΛ) is computed from the terms of lower
orders already computed (ie (hj)2≤j≤k−1 ) and from the terms of lower
order of f.

203
Fix k ∈N. Assume that steps of order 2, ...., k −1 are already per-
formed (ie the terms (hj)2≤j≤k−1 are known). By dropping the parame-
ters k and m in the above notation for simplicity of formulae, the space
Dm
k is written as
Dm

and as a consequence the space V m

where Hi ∈V m

to z of H (z) = f (Φz + h (z)) . An exact formula of Hi is given by the
following proposition :
Proposition 34 Under the standing hypothesis (H), it follows that

h = 0 results in
H (z) = f (Φz) + Df (Φz) h (z) +

Finally comparing the same order terms of (3.22) yields us the result of
the proposition.
Remark 3 Fk (z) (θ) is an element of V m

where F k

clear relationship between Fk (z) and the terms of h (already computed)
as well as the terms of the nonlinearity f of the original FED
In the same way as above, by comparing the k-order terms of (3.11),
we obtain

(3.24)

leads

where

So, by substituting the above expression of Xk into the relation (3.27),
it follows that the vector Xk (0) is a solution of the linear system

the terms f2, · · · · · · , fk of f.
Remark 5 It is noted that the matrix Bk need not to be nonsingular.
So, in order to compute the initial data Xk (0) of the problem (2.1) , we
should take into account the abstract condition Xk ∈(QΛ)k . The only
way to do that is the formal adjoint theory deﬁned in the preliminary
section. More precisely, a solution of (3.33) must satisfy

As a consequence, the vector Xk (0) should be a solution of a system of
two systems

(3.35)
Finally, one can see that equation (3.35) is all what can be extracted
from the coeﬃcients of hk. That’s why, our interest will be focused in
the well posedness of problem (3.35) . The following result provides us
with the complete scheme of computing the homogeneous part of degree
k of a local center manifold.
Theorem 3 Let

ak
i

i=1,··· ,k be the family of the coeﬃcients of the graph
representation of any local center manifold associated with equation (2.1) ,
in the basis

zqi
i=1,··· ,k of the polynomials of degree k with coeﬃcient
in QΛ. Then, the

ak
i

i=1,··· ,k are uniquely determined by the equation
(3.35) , in which the F k are given by ( 3.23), Ek by ( 3.31) and Bk by
( 3.30).
Proof.
In view of the above computations, one can see that if

ak
i

i=1,··· ,k is such a family of coeﬃcients then, it satisﬁes equation
(3.35).
What remains to be seen is that equation (3.35) leads to a
unique set of coeﬃcients that is, no additional information or equation
is necessary for the computation the k-th term in the Taylor expansion
of h. To this end, it is suﬃcient to prove that Y k ≡0 is the unique
solution of the problem





dY k (θ)
dθ
=
AkY k (θ) , for θ ∈[−r, 0]
BkY k (0) = 0
and
CkY k (0) = 0.
(3.36)
In other words, it suﬃces to prove that Y k (0) = 0 is the unique solution
of the two systems
BkY k (0) = 0 and
CkY k (0) = 0.
(3.37)
So, we have to prove that the kernel of the bloc matrix

Bk
Ck

is exactly
zero. To this end, we distinguish two cases: In the ﬁrst case we assume
that µi /∈Λ for all i ∈
&
1, 2, ..., k
'
. Fix i ∈
&
1, 2, ..., k
'
. Since ℜe


=

208
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
0, then, the characteristic matrix ∆

µi
is nonsingular. So, in view of
the form (3.30) of the matrix Bk, it follows that Ker (Bk) = {0} . Or
Ker


Bk
Ck

= Ker (Bk) ∩Ker (Ck) = {0} .
This implies that Y k (0) = 0 and thus Y k ≡0 is the unique solution
of the problem (3.36) . In the second case we assume that for all i in a
subset Jk ⊂
&
1, 2, ..., k
'
, the value µi coincides with an element of Λ.
To conclude the proof of the theorem we need the following lemma.
Lemma 28 Assume that for i ∈Jk ⊂
&
1, 2, ..., k
'
, µi coincides with an
element of Λ. Then, there exist a nonsingular nk × nk matrix Dk such
that the boundary condition (3.37) can be written as
DkY k (0) = 0,
where Dk is a matrix that can be constructed by mixing terms of Bk and
those of Ck.
Proof. Consider the mapping α : Jk ∋i −→α (i) ∈{1, 2, ...., m} ,
such that λα(i) = µi. Then φα(i) (θ) = exp

θµi
and
6
ψα(i), φα(i)
7
= 1.
When n = 1 (the scalar case), we have ∆

µi
= 0 for i ∈Jk. So, if
we denote by Dk the matrix obtained from Bk and Ck by replacing
the rows i ∈Jk of Bk with the rows (i + α (i)) ∈
&
1, 2, ...., mk
'
of Ck
respectively. Then it is easy to see that Dk is invertible.
Thus, the
boundary conditions (3.37) is equivalent to DkY k (0) = 0. In the non-
scalar case (n > 1) , it is diﬃcult to guess exactly the rows that we should
eliminate from the matrix Bk and the ones that we can bring from the
matrix Ck in order to build the invertible matrix Dk. But it is easy to
prove that the kernel of the block matrix

Bk
Ck

is reduced to zero. In
fact, let b = col

b1, b2, ...., bk
an element of Cnk such that Bkb = 0 and
Ckb = 0. In an induction procedure, we will show that bi = 0 for all
i ∈
&
1, 2, ...., k

. In view of (3.32) and (3.34) , it follows that b1 satisﬁes

b1 = 0

Note that µi is a complex element with zero real part. So, by virtue

=nk and consequently, by the use of elementary linear algebra tools, one
can build a matrix Dk satisfying the lemma. This achieves the proof.
Remark 6 In the same way as above, one can prove that the problem
(3.35) can be written as





dXk (θ)
dθ
=
AkXk (θ) + F k (θ) , for θ ∈[−r, 0]
DkXk (0) = Rk
(3.39)
where Dk is the matrix given in the above lemma and Rk is a complex
vector whose components are a mixing of those of the vectors Ek and
Nk. In conclusion, the problem of computing terms of a local center
manifold can be formulated in resolving a sequence of ﬁnite dimensional
ODEs. This formulation makes the problem of computing coeﬃcients of
a local center manifold in suitable form easy to manipulate in symbolic
or numerical computations.

the study of qualitative structure of the ﬂow on the center manifold,
the authors need more precise information about a center manifold. In
particular, they need to know its Taylor expansion up to the second
order terms. It is a singularly perturbed delay equation given by

If r = 1 and λ = 0, then, the characteristic equation associated to (3.42)
is

The above equation has zero as a double root and the remaining roots
have a negative real part. This ensures the existence of a two dimensional
center manifold associated to the equation (3.42) with (r, λ) = (1, 0)

Computational scheme of Normal Forms
In this section, we present an algorithm for computing normal forms
for FDEs. In the context of ODEs, the key idea is based on comput-
ing a change of variables that allows us to transform the original ODE
into an equation with a simpler analytic expression. In this section, we

214
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
will be concerned with developing, in an algorithmic way, the notion of
normal forms for FDEs of the form (2.1) . Our approach is shared out
in two shutters. In the ﬁrst subsection, we assume that a local center
manifold is known and we deal with developing, in conventional way, a
computational scheme of normal form for the ODE (2.9) representing
the restriction of the semi-ﬂow generated by (2.1). In the second subsec-
tion, we deal with the equation (2.1) as an abstract inﬁnite dimensional
ODE of the form (2.8) ; our method consists in elaborating a scheme
of computing nonlinear transformations that greatly simplify the (2.8) ,
and we will show that this scheme leads us to simpler inﬁnite dimen-
sional ODE which coincides with the normal form of (2.1) (in the sense
of deﬁnition presented in [44]).
4.1
Normal form construction of the reduced
system
Let h be a mapping from Rm into QΛ whose graph is a local center
manifold associated with the equation (2.1) . In the previous section, we
have elaborated an algorithmic procedure allowing us to compute at any
order k the terms of the Taylor expansion of h. Note that, in general, it is
the most information that can extracted from h with the impossibility of
obtaining the closed form. Without loss of generality h may be assumed
in the form
h =

i≥2
hi.
The ﬂow of the FDE (2.1), on this local center manifold is described by
the following m-dimensional ODE
•x = Bx + G (x) ,
(4.44)
where G (x) = Ψ (0) H (x) . If we assume that (hi)i≥2 are already com-
puted, then terms of the ODE (4.44) are known at any order. In other
words, if G = 
i≥2 Gi then Gi is known for all i ≥2 once (hi)i≥2 are
founded.
Consider a nonlinear transformation of the form
x = x + V (x)
(4.45)
where V be a mapping from Rm into Rm such that V (0) = 0, DV (0) =
0. Assume that the eﬀects of the above change of variables on the reduced
system (4.46) is of the form
•
x = Bx + F (x) .
(4.46)

Approximating center manifolds and normal forms for FDE
215
Our main goal now is to develop an algorithmic scheme providing us
with adequate nonlinear transformations V that transform (2.6) into
a simpler equation (4.46) (ie. the nonlinearity F is simpler than H).
Without loss of generality, we put
V =

i≥2
Vi and F =

i≥2
Fi.
In the sequel, we will deal with developing a the recursive eﬃcient ap-
proach for computing the kth order normal form Fk and the kth order
nonlinear transformation Vk in terms of (Gi)2≤i≤k as well as the terms
(Fi)2≤i≤k−1 already computed. We start by the following Deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 35 Let j ≥2. We denote by M1
j the operator deﬁned by

M1
j p

(x) = Dp (x) Bx −Bp (x) ,
for all p ∈V m
j
(Rm) .
The operators M1
j , deﬁned above, are exactly the Lie brackets that
appear in computing normal forms for ﬁnite dimensional ODEs. It is
well known that the space V m

(Rm) may be decomposed as
V m

(4.47)
where the complementary space Im

Let P j be the projection associated with the above decomposition. If
we choose bases for Im

M1

, then, each element q of

Theorem 4 Fix k ≥2. Then, the recursive formula for computing the
coeﬃcients of the normal form associated to the decomposition (4.47) is
given by

the above equation as

Finally comparing terms degree k in the above equation yields the for-
mula (4.48). This achieves the proof of the Theorem.
The formula (3.23) given in the above theorem can be rewritten in a
compact form
Fk = 5Gk −M1

(4.49)
where

Then, by virtue of (4.49) and (4.47), one can compute an adequate
nonlinear transformation Vk such that
M1
kVk = P k 5Gk,
(4.50)
and which leads us to
Fk =

I −P k
5Gk.
(4.51)
In other words, we can ﬁnd a change of variables that aﬀect the reduced
system by taking away nonlinear terms (called non resonant terms) that
are in the range subspaces Im

M1


and conserving only terms (called
resonant terms) that are in the complementary subspace Im

M1

c .
Remark 7 It has been observed that the subspace Im

M1
k
c is not
uniquely determined. Moreover, according to the equations (4.50) and
(4.51) , one can note that the nonlinear transformation Vk depends on
the choice of Im

M1
k
c. Consequently the normal forms are not unique.
In applications, we choose a suitable complementary space to the situa-
tion to be handled.

Approximating center manifolds and normal forms for FDE

Remark 8 In view of the above Theorem, it is noted that the kth order
term Fk of the normal form depends upon the known of (Fj)2≤j≤k−1 and
the results (Vj)2≤j≤k as well as (Gj)2≤j≤k−1 . However, it has observed
from the Proposition (34) that the homogeneous polynomial Gj can be
given in terms of (hi)2≤i≤j−1 . Hence, in order to present the complete
scheme for computing normal forms for (2.6) , we must take into ac-
count the algorithm developed in section 3 and which provides us with
homogeneous parts of the mapping h. As a consequence, the complete
scheme for computing normal forms for (2.6) should be a combination
of the formulae (3.21) , (3.39) and (3.23) .
In order to save computational time and computer memory, the follow-
ing Theorem illustrates another approach that combines center manifold
and normal forms schemes into one step to simultaneously obtain a com-
pact form illustrating the close relationship between the normal forms
F, the associated nonlinear transformations V, a local center manifold h
and the coeﬃcients of the original FDE (2.1) .
Theorem 5 Eﬀect the reduced system (2.9) with a nonlinear transfor-
mation of the form (4.45) . So, if x is a solution of the equation ( 2.1)
then F and V satisfy
DV (x) Bx−BV (x) = Ψ (0) f

Φ [x + V (x)] + 5h (x)

−DV (x) F (x)−F (x) (4.52)
and
D5h (x) B−5A15h (x) = (I −π) X0f

Φ [x + V (x)] + 5h (x)

−D5h (x) F (x) ,
(4.53)
where 5h (x) = h (x + V (x)) .
Proof. Substituting the nonlinear transformation (4.45) into (2.6)
results in
[I + DV (x)]
•
x = Bx + BV (x) + 5f1 (x) ,
where 5f1 (x) = Ψ (0) f

Φ [x + V (x)] + 5h (x)

. So, in view of (FN1) it
follows that
[I + DV (x)] [Bx + F (x)] = Bx + BV (x) + 5f1 (x) ,
which can be rearranged as
DV (x) Bx −BV (x) = 5f1 (x) −DV (x) F (x) −F (x) .
This gives the relation (4.52) . To prove (4.53) , we need the following
lemma:

218
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Lemma 30 Let h be a map from Rm into QΛ with h (0) = 0 and
Dh (0) = 0. A necessary and suﬃcient conditions on the graph of h to
be a local center manifold of equation (2.1) is that there exists a neigh-
borhood V of zero in Rm such that
Dh (z) Bz −5A1h (z) = (I −π) X0f (Φz + h (z)) −Dh (z) Ψ (0) f (Φz + h (z))
for z ∈V
(4.54)
Proof.
Substituting the nonlinear transformation (4.45) into the
equation (4.54) satisﬁed by h results in
Dh (x + V (x))

Bx + BV (x) + 5f1 (x)

−5A1h (x + V (x)) = 5f2 (x)
with 5f2 (x) = (I −π) X0f

Φ [x + V (x)] + 5h (x)

. So, by the aid of the
formula (4.52) already proved, the above equation reads
Dh (x + V (x)) [I + DV (x)] [Bx + F (x)] −5A1h (x + V (x)) = 5f2 (x) ,
which is equivalent to
D5h (x) B −5A15h (x) = 5f2 (x) −D5h (x) F (x) .
This achieves the proof of the theorem.
In general, the closed form solutions of (4.53) cannot be founded.
Thus, approximate solutions may be assumed in the form of
5h =

then, comparing the same order in the equations (4.52) and (4.53) in the

that the lower order terms in V and 5h are already computed, then, in
order to compute an adequate nonlinear transformation Vk that greatly
simpliﬁes the reduced system, we proceed in the following way: We con-
sider the equation (4.55) , then, by the aid of a decomposition of the

Remark 9 One can ask a question about the usefulness of the second
equation (4.56) of the scheme. In fact, once H1
k is known, the equation
(4.56) will be needed for computing the kth order term 5hk which allows
us to pass to the next step k + 1 where the computation of the (k + 1)th
order normal form Fk+1 and the (k + 1)th order nonlinear transforma-
tion as well as 5hk+1. In conclusion, solving equation (4.56) is necessary
for passing from a step to step.
Let us now consider the equation (4.56) . In view of the deﬁnition of
5h and the formula (4.57) one can easily observe that 5hk and H2
k are
respectively elements of V m

In conclusion, we claim that the sequence of equations (4.55) and
(4.61) is all what we need for computing normal formes for the reduced
system (2.6) at any order.
Remark 10 In the work [44], the authors have been concerned with
solving, at each step, equations similar to (4.55) and (4.56) . In view of
the diﬃculties entailed by the operator 5A1 in the deﬁnition of M2
j (j ≥2),
the authors in [44] have been restricted to the study of the spectrum of
5A1. And under non resonance conditions, the authors in [44] proved that
M2
j is nonsingular for all j ≥2. However, their derivation does not
allow them to compute or at least approximate the inverse of
M2

contrast, the previous result provides us with a suitable form of (4.56)
which lends itself to numerical or symbolic computations by means of a
recursive process.

Normal form construction for FDEs
In this subsection, we will be concerned with equation (2.1) , for which
an algorithmic scheme for computing normal forms is derived. In view
of the preliminary section, it is known that equation (2.1) can viewed as
an inﬁnite dimensional ODE given by
 •x
=
Bx + f
1 (x, y)
•y
=
5A1y + f
2 (x, y)
(4.62)

222

where f
1 (x, y) = Ψ (0) f (Φx + y) and f
2 (x, y) = (I −π) X0f (Φx + y) .
Eﬀecting the equation (4.62) with nonlinear transformations of the form
3
x
=
x + V 1 (x)
y
=
y + V 2 (x)
(4.63)
results in
 •
x
=
Bx + g1 (x, y)
•
y
=
5A1y + g2 (x, y)
(4.64)
Our goal in the sequel is to develop an iterative procedure for ﬁnd-
ing adequate transformations V 1 and V 2 that greatly simplify equation
(4.62) . As has been deﬁned in [44], the transformed equation (4.64) as-
sociated to that change of variables is called normal form of (2.1). We
ﬁrst start by stating the following Theorem that illustrates us how, the
above change of variables (4.63) , aﬀects equation (4.62) .
Theorem 7 Eﬀecting the equation (4.62) with the change of variables
(4.45) results in equation of the form(4.64) with g1 and g2 satisfying


−DV 2 (x) g1 (x, y)−

(4.66)
Proof. First, diﬀerentiating the relations of (4.63) results in
 •x
=

I + DV 1 (x)
 •
x
•y
=
•
y + DV 2 (x)
•
x
So, assuming that the change of variables (4.45) transforms equation
(4.62) into equation of the form (FN2) yields
 •x
=

I + DV 1 (x)
 
Bx + g1 (x, y)

•y
=

5A1y + g2 (x, y)

+ DV 2 (x)

Bx + g1 (x, y)

Finally combining the above formula with (4.62) and (4.63) yields equa-
tions (4.65) and (4.66) . This ends the proof of the Theorem.
A conventional approach for computing normal forms consists in ﬁnd-
ing adequate nonlinear transformations V 1 and V 2 that provide us, by
substituting them into equation (4.62) , with a simpler form of the both

223
of g1 and g2. In general, however, the closed form of V 1 and V 2 respec-
tively solutions of (4.65) and (4.66) cannot be founded. Thus, approxi-
mate solutions may be assumed in the form of
V 1 =


Our task is then reduced only to the computation terms of the Taylor

And thus g2
k (x, 0) = 0. To be explicit, we state the following deﬁnition,
similar to the one given in [44], of normal forms for (2.1):
Deﬁnition 36 The normal form for (2.1) (or equation (2.7)) relative
to the decomposition (4.47) is an equation of the form

Now, with the aid of the previous Deﬁnition, we are in position to
state the following Theorem summarizing the results for the new recur-
sive and computationally eﬃcient approach, providing us with terms of
the normal form for FDEs at any order and the associated nonlinear
transformations:
Theorem 9 Consider an FDE of the form (2.1) with non hyperbolic
steady state satisfying the hypothesis (H) . If we consider (2.1) as an
inﬁnite dimensional ODE of the form (2.8) , then there exists formal

the normal form (in the usual sense for ODEs) of the reduced system of
(2.1) on this invariant manifold is given by the m-dimensional ODE
•
x = Bx + g1 (x, 0) .
(4.75)

Proof: After what was done before the statement, one can see that
the ﬁrst part of the Theorem is a direct consequence of properties of the
operators M1
k and M2
k stated in the previous subsection combined with
the equations (4.71) , (4.65) , (4.73) . Let us to prove the second part of
the Theorem. This will be done in two steps: First, substituting y = 0
into (4.69) results in

So, if we observe that
H1
i (x) = Ψ (0) fi (Φx)
for i ≥2
then, it follows that
g1
k (x, 0) = Fk (x) .
As a consequence, the equation (4.75) is exactly the normal form of the
reduced system of (2.1) in the local center manifold considered. In the
second step, we need to show that y = 0 provides us with this center
manifold. To this end we need the following lemma:
Lemma 31 The equation y = 0 yields the equation of a local invariant
center manifold of (2.1) .
Proof: Substituting y = 0 in the change of variables (4.63) yields
3
x
=
x + V 1 (x)
y

V 2 (x) .
(4.76)
So, by applying the implicit functions Theorem to the above equation,
one can prove the existence of a function h mapping a neighborhood V
of zero in Rm into Ker (π) such that y = l (x) . This implies that
V 2 (x) = 5l (x) = l

(4.77)
In the other hand, it is known that V 2 (x) is a solution of (4.66) . This
reads

x + V 1 (x) , V 2 (x)

So, by virtue of (4.77), the above equation can be written as

To
achieve the proof of the Lemma, we should prove that the kth parts 5lk (x)
and 5hk (x) respectively of 5l (x) and 5h (x) coincide for all k ≥2. This will
be done is a recursive way: In one hand, for k = 2, it is noted that 5l2 (x)
and 5h2 (x) are respectively solutions of


(x) = (I −π) X0f2 (x)
and

M2


(x) = (I −π) X0f2 (x), and since the operator is nonsingu-
lar then it follows that 5l2 (x) = 5h2 (x) . In the other hand, Assuming that
5li (x) = 5hi (x) for 2 ≤i ≤k −1 results in
H2
k (x) = Gk (x) ,
where Gk (x) is the homogeneous part of degree k of the function G (x)
deﬁned above.
Thus, combining (4.78) and (4.56) leads to 5lk (x) =
5hk (x) . This ends the proof of the Theorem.

Introduction
The key idea of the normal form (n.f.) technique is to transform a
nonlinear diﬀerential equation into an equation with a simpler analytic
expression, called a normal form, which has the same qualitative behav-
iour of the original equation. In the framework of ordinary diﬀerential
equations (ODEs), this idea is very old, going back to the late XIX
century with the works of Poincar´e on Celestial Mechanics, and early
XX century with the works of Liapunov and Birkhoﬀ. More recently
(1970’s), Bibikov and Br’juno gave signiﬁcant contributions to the ﬁeld.
Before developing a normal form theory for delay diﬀerential equa-
tions (DDEs), a brief explanation of the method for ODEs is given.
Consider an autonomous nonlinear ODE in Rn with an equilibrium
at zero,
˙x(t) = Bx + f(x)
(1.1)
where B is an n × n constant matrix, f(0) = 0, Df(0) = 0 and f ∈
Ck(k ≥2). The application of the method of n.f. is of interest mostly
in the case of a non-hyperbolic equilibrium x = 0. In fact, if x = 0
is a hyperbolic equilibrium, i.e., all the eigenvalues of B have nonzero
real parts, the theorem of Hartman-Grobman assures that, around the
origin, Eq. (1.1) is topologically equivalent to the linearization ˙x = Bx.

f(x) =

j=2

j!fj(x) + o(|x|k),
where fj ∈V n
j (Rn) is the j-th Fr´echet derivative of f at zero. Here, we
use the notation V n
j (Y ) to denote the space of homogeneous polynomials
of degree j in n variables x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn, with coeﬃcients in Y ,
for Y a Banach space.
The method of n.f. consists of a recursive process of changes of
variables, such that, at each step j, 2 ≤j ≤k, all the nonrelevant terms
of order j are eliminated from the equation. At a step j, assume that
steps of orders 2, . . . , j −1 have already been performed, leading to
˙x = Bx + 1
2g2(x) + · · · +
1
(j −1)!gj−1(x) + 1
j!
˜fj(x) + h.o.t,
where
1
j! ˜fj(x) are the terms of order j obtained after the changes of
variables in previous steps, and h.o.t stands for higher order terms. A
change of variables of the form
x = ¯x + 1
j!Uj(¯x),
with
Uj ∈V n
j (Rn),
(1.2)
is then applied to the above equation, transforming it into
˙¯x = B¯x + 1
2g2(¯x) + · · · + 1
j!gj(¯x) + h.o.t,
¯x ∈Rn,
(1.3)
with the new terms of order j given by
gj = ˜fj −[B, Uj],
where [B, Uj] is the Lie bracket
[B, Uj](x) = DUj(x)Bx −BUj(x).
The operators associated with these changes of variables,
Mj : V n
j (Rn) →V n
j (Rn),
MjU = [B, U],
(1.4)
permit to write gj = ˜fj −MjUj. Hence, one can choose Uj in such a way
that
gj ∈Im (Mj)c,
228

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
where Im (Mj)c is a complementary space (in general not uniquely de-
termined) of Im (Mj). Let Pj : V n
j (Rn) →Im (Mj) be the canonical
projection associated with a decomposition
V n
j (Rn) = Im (Mj) ⊕Im (Mj)c.
(1.5)
In order to have
gj = ProjIm (Mj)c ˜fj = (I −Pj) ˜fj,
(1.6)
Uj must be chosen so that MjUj = Pj ˜fj, thus
Uj = (Mj)−1Pj ˜fj,
(1.7)
where (Mj)−1 is a right inverse of Mj, associated with a decomposition
V n
j (Rn) = Ker (Mj) ⊕Ker (Mj)c. For gj, Uj deﬁned by (1.6), (1.7),
Eq. (1.3) is called a normal form for Eq. (1.1), up to j order terms.
The terms 1
j!gj(x) ∈Im (Mj)c that cannot be eliminated from (1.1) are
called resonant terms of order j.
Consider now an equation (1.1) in the form
3
˙x
= Bx + f1(x, y)
˙y
= Cy + f2(x, y),
x ∈Rp, y ∈Rm,
(1.8)
where B is a p×p matrix, C is an m×m matrix, p+m = n, Re λ(B) =
0, Re λ(C) ̸= 0, f1 : Rn →Rp, f2 : Rn →Rm are Ck functions (k ≥2)
such that f1(0, 0) = 0, f2(0, 0) = 0, Df1(0, 0) = 0, Df2(0, 0) = 0. The
centre manifold theorem tells us that there is a centre manifold W c =
{(x, y) : y = h(x), x ∈V }, where V is a neighbourhood of 0 ∈Rp,
tangent at zero to the centre space Rp for the linearization of (1.8), and
that the qualitative behaviour of the ﬂow near zero is determined by its
behaviour on the centre manifold.
In order to apply the normal form procedure to the equation for the
ﬂow on the centre manifold of (1.8), there are two possible approaches.
We can actually compute recursively the function h(x) = 1
2h2(x) + · · ·
giving the equation of W c (see e.g. [24]), and therefore write the equation
for the ﬂow on such manifold:
˙x = Bx + f1(x, h(x)).
(1.9)
After this ﬁrst step, the method of n.f. described above is applied to
compute a n.f. for (1.9). This approach is not very eﬃcient, since it
requires to compute the centre manifold beforehand.
229

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Another procedure ([29,
Chapter 12]) is based on the idea that,
at each step j, a change of variables is used to project the original
equation (1.8) on the centre manifold and, simultaneously, to eliminate
the non-resonant terms of order j from the equation giving the ﬂow
on the centre manifold. This is achieved by considering a sequence of
change of variables
x = ¯x + 1
j!U1
j (¯x),
y = ¯y + 1
j!U2
j (¯x),
(1.10)
where U1
j ∈V p
j (Rp), U2
j ∈V p
j (Rm). Following the procedure described
above, where now the change of variables (1.2) is replaced by (1.10),
after steps j = 2, . . . , k Eq. (1.8) is transformed into an equation in the
form

, x ∈Rp, y ∈Rm,
(1.11)
where the new terms gj = (g1

j ) of orders j, j = 2, . . . , k, are given by
g1
j = ˜f1
j −M1

j U = [B, U], and
M2
j : V p
j (Rm) →V p
j (Rm),
(M2
j U)(x) = DU(x)Bx −CU(x).
(1.12)
Remark 1.1. This latter procedure provides a general setting to be
naturally extended to inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, such as the natural
phase space for a retarded functional diﬀerential equation (FDE) in Rn.
However, some diﬃculties arise in working in an inﬁnite-dimensional
phase space. First of all, it is not clear how to decompose the linear part
of an FDE in Rn so that it can be written as (1.8), where x ∈Rp ≡P, for
P the centre space for its linearization at zero, and y in a complementary
space P c for P. Note that the linearization of (1.8) is given by the system
3 ˙x= Bx
˙y= Cy,
x ∈Rp, y ∈Rm.
(1.13)
Clearly, a complementary space P c for P can be obtained by using the
formal adjoint theory for linear DDEs in Rn (cf. [58]), although this
is not suﬃcient to decompose a linear DDE into a decoupled system of
linear DDEs similar to (1.13). A second diﬃculty comes from the fact
that the operator M2
j in (1.12) will be deﬁned in an inﬁnite-dimensional
space V p
j (P c). Hence a decomposition similar to (1.5) is not obvious.
230

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Remark 1.2. For the sake of exposition, in general formal Taylor series
will be considered. Even if f is analytic, the function g = 1
2g2+ 1
3!g3+· · ·
in the n.f. is not necessarily analytic. However, in applications this is not
a problem, since we are mainly interested in applying n.f. to the study of
singularities with possible bifurcations that are generically determined
up to a ﬁnite jet.

Normal Forms for FDEs in Finite
Dimensional Spaces
In the next sections, we refer the reader to [58] for notation and
general results on the theory of retarded FDEs in ﬁnite dimensional
spaces.
Consider autonomous semilinear FDEs of retarded type in Rn (or
Cn) and with an equilibrium point at the origin,
˙u(t) = L(ut) + F(ut)
(t ≥0),
(2.1)
where r > 0, C := C([−r, 0]; Rn) is the Banach space of continuous
mappings from [−r, 0] to Rn equipped with the sup norm, ut ∈C is
deﬁned by ut(θ) = u(t+θ) for θ ∈[−r, 0], L : C →Rn is a bounded linear
operator, and F is a Ck function (k ≥2), with F(0) = 0, DF(0) = 0.
Consider also the linearized equation at zero,
˙u(t) = L(ut),
(2.2)
and its characteristic equation
det∆(λ) = 0,
∆(λ) := L(eλ·I) −λI,
where I is the n×n identity matrix. Let A be the inﬁnitesimal generator
for the C0-semigroup deﬁned by the ﬂow of (2.2),
A : D(A) ⊂C →C,
Aϕ = ˙ϕ,
where D(A) = {ϕ ∈C : ˙ϕ ∈C, ˙ϕ(0) = L(ϕ)}. We recall that A has only
the point spectrum, and
σ(A) = σP (A) = {λ ∈C : det∆(λ) = 0}.

Fix a nonempty ﬁnite set Λ = {λ1, . . . , λs} ⊂σ(A).
Using the
formal adjoint theory of Hale (see [58, Chapter 7]), the phase space C
is decomposed by Λ as
C = P ⊕Q,
where P is the generalized eigenspace associated with the eigenvalues
in Λ, Q = {ϕ ∈C : (ψ, ϕ) = 0 for all ψ ∈P ∗}, and the dual space
P ∗is the generalized eigenspace for A∗associated with the eigenvalues
in Λ.
For dual bases Φ and Ψ of P and P ∗respectively, such that
(Ψ, Φ) = Ip, p = dim P, there exists a p×p real matrix B with σ(B) = Λ,
that satisﬁes simultaneously ˙Φ = ΦB and −˙Ψ = BΨ.
2.2
The enlarged phase space
To develop a normal form theory for FDEs, ﬁrst it is necessary to
enlarge the phase space C in such a way that (2.1) is written as an
abstract ODE. An adequate phase space to accomplish this is the space
BC (see [30, 44, 45]) deﬁned by
BC := {ψ : [−r, 0] →Rn | ψ is continuous on [−r, 0), ∃lim
θ→0−ψ(θ) ∈Rn},
with the sup norm. The elements of BC have the form ψ = ϕ+X0α, ϕ ∈
C, α ∈Rn, where

(I is the n × n identity matrix),
so that BC is identiﬁed with C × Rn with the norm |ϕ + X0α| = |ϕ|C +
|α|Rn.
Let v(t) = ut ∈C. In BC, Eq. (2.1) takes the form
 dv
dt (0)= L(v) + F(v)
dv
dt (θ)= ˙v(θ),
for θ ∈[−r, 0),
232

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
with the notation dv
dθ(θ) = ˙v(θ), θ ∈[−r, 0]. Deﬁne an extension of the
inﬁnitesimal generator A, denoted by ˜A,
˜A : C1 ⊂BC →BC,
˜Aϕ = ˙ϕ + X0[L(ϕ) −˙ϕ(0)],
where D( ˜A) = C1 := {ϕ ∈C | ˙ϕ ∈C}. We then write (2.1) as
dv
dt = ˜Av + X0F(v),
(2.3)
which is the abstract ODE in BC associated with (2.1). In a natural
way, we also extend the duality (·, ·)C∗×C to a bilinear form on C∗×BC
by deﬁning
(ψ, X0α) = ψ(0)α,
ψ ∈C∗, α ∈Rn.
The canonical projection of C onto P associated with the decomposition
C = P ⊕Q, ϕ →ϕP = Φ(Ψ, ϕ), is therefore extended to a canonical
projection
π : BC →P,
π(ϕ+X0α) = Φ

(Ψ, ϕ)+Ψ(0)α

, ϕ ∈C, α ∈Rn. (2.4)
By using the deﬁnition of π and ˜A, and integration by parts, it is easy
to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 2.1. π is a continuous projection on BC that commutes with
˜A on D( ˜A) = C1.
Since π is a continuous projection, the decomposition C = P ⊕Q
yields a decomposition of BC by Λ as the topological direct sum
BC = P ⊕Ker π.
(2.5)
Writing v ∈C1 according to the above decomposition, v = Φx + y,
with x ∈Rp (p = dim P), y ∈C1 ∩Ker π = C1 ∩Q := Q1, and since
π ˜A = ˜Aπ in C1, (2.3) becomes
Φdx
dt + dy
dt = ˜AΦx + ˜Ay + πX0F(Φx + y) + (I −π)X0F(Φx + y)
= ˙Φx + ˜Ay + ΦΨ(0)F(Φx + y) + (I −π)X0F(Φx + y).
Therefore, Eq. (2.3) is decomposed as a system of abstract ODEs in
Rp × Ker π ≡BC, as

˙x = Bx + Ψ(0)F(Φx + y)
˙y = AQ1y + (I −π)X0F(Φx + y),
x ∈Rp, y ∈Q1,
(2.6)
where AQ1 is the restriction of ˜A to Q1 interpreted as an operator acting
in the Banach space Ker π.
233

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Note that the linear part of system (2.6) looks like (1.13), i.e., the
ﬁnite dimensional variable x and the inﬁnite dimensional variable y are
decoupled in the linear part of the equation. We also point out that
the enlarged phase space BC was used by Chow and Mallet-Paret [30]
to derive system (2.6). However, since the decomposition (2.5) was not
explicitly given in [30], the deﬁnition of the linear operator AQ1 in the
second equation of (2.6) was not adequate.
In fact, the spectrum of
AQ1 plays an important role in the construction of normal forms, so it
is crucial to restrict ˜A to a linear operator in the Banach space Ker π.
In this setting, we can prove [44] that
Lemma 2.2. σ(AQ1) = σP (AQ1) = σ(A) \ Λ.
2.3
Normal form construction
In applications, we are particularly interested in obtaining n.f. for
equations giving the ﬂow on centre manifolds. Therefore, and for the
sake of exposition, we turn our attention to the case where Λ is the set of
eigenvalues of A on the imaginary axis, Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ = 0} ̸= ∅.
The centre manifold theorem ([58, Chapter 10] and references therein)
assures that there is a p-dimensional invariant manifold for (2.1),
W c = {ϕ ∈C : ϕ = Φx + h(x), for x ∈V },
(2.7)
where V is a neighbourhood of 0 ∈Rp, which is tangent to the centre
space P for (2.2) at zero. From Eq. (2.6), we write the ODE for the
ﬂow on W c as
˙x = Bx + Ψ(0)F(Φx + h(x)),
x ∈V.
(2.8)
The goal now is to develop an algorithm of n.f. which aﬀects si-
multaneously the linearization of the centre manifold and reduces the
ODE (2.8) to a n.f., up to a ﬁnite order k. In fact, as we will mention,
we can consider any nonempty ﬁnite set Λ ⊂σ(A) for which there is
an invariant manifold tangent to P at zero, where P is the generalized
eigenspace of (2.2) associated with the eigenvalues in Λ. In this case, the
method described here is applied to compute a n.f. for the ODE giving
the ﬂow on such manifold.
Consider the formal Taylor expansion of F,

f2
j (x, y) = (I −π)X0Fj(Φx + y). (2.10)
As for autonomous ODEs in Rn, n.f. are obtained by a recursive
process of changes of variables. At a step j, the terms of order j ≥2 are
computed from the terms of the same order and from the terms of lower
orders already computed in previous steps. Assume that steps of orders
2, . . . , j −1 have already been performed, leading to

j ) the terms of order j in (x, y) obtained
after the previous transformations of variables. At step j, eﬀect a change
of variables that has the form
(x, y) = (¯x, ¯y) + 1

(2.11j)

With Uj = (U1

gj(x, y) = ˜fj(x, y) −MjUj(x),
so for y = 0 one can deﬁne
gj(x, o) = (I −Pj) ˜fj(x, 0),
(2.14)
where I is the identity operator on V p
j (Rp) × V p
j (Ker π) and Pj =
(P 1
j , P 2
j ) is the canonical projection of V p
j (Rp)×V p
j (Ker π) onto Im Mj.
The operators M1
j , deﬁned by the Lie brackets, are the operators
that appear in Section 1 for computing n.f. for ﬁnite-dimensional ODEs.
The inﬁnite-dimensional part in the transformation formulas is handled
through the operators M2
j . Clearly, the ranges of M1
j , M2
j contain ex-
actly the terms that can be removed from the equation, called non-
resonant terms. The remaining terms (resonant terms) are in general
not determined in a unique way, depending on the choices of comple-
mentary spaces Im (Mj)c for Im (Mj). We are particularly interested in
the situation of M2
j surjective and one-to-one, j ≥2.
Theorem 2.3. Assume that the operators M2
j , 2 ≤j ≤k, are one-
to-one and onto. Let (x, y) = Θ(¯x, ¯y) = (¯x, ¯y) + O(|¯x|k) be the change
of variables obtained after the sequence of transformations (2.11j), 2 ≤
j ≤k. Then, the local centre manifold W c for (2.1) deﬁned in (2.7) is
transformed into
W
c = {ϕ ∈C : ϕ = Φ¯x + h(¯x), for ¯x ∈V },
where V is a neighbourhood of 0 ∈Rp, with
h(¯x) = o(|¯x|k).

and the change (x, y) = Θ(¯x, ¯y) can be chosen so that (2.15) is in n.f.
(in the usual sense of n.f. for ODEs).

Proof. Let Eq. (2.6) be transformed into

˙¯y = AQ1 ¯y + k

(2.16)
through the change (x, y) = Θ(¯x, ¯y). Write h(x) = 1
2h2(x) + o(|x|2). For
y = h(x), from (2.16) we get
Dh(x) ˙x = AQ1(h(x)) + 1
2g2
2(x, h(x)) + O(|x|4).
Using again (2.16), we have
1
2Dh2(x)[Bx + O(|x|2)] + O(|x|3) = 1
2AQ1(h2(x)) + 1
2g2
2(x, 0) + O(|x|3).
From (2.14), we conclude that g2
2(x, 0) = 0, because M2
2 is onto. Hence
Dh2(x)Bx −AQ1(h2(x)) = 0,
that is, M2
2 h2 = 0. Since M2
2 is one-to-one, this implies that h2 = 0, and
thus y = o(|x|2). On the other hand, since the operators M1
j coincide
with the operators in the algorithm for computing n.f. for ODEs in Rp,
equation
˙¯x = B¯x + 1
2g1
2(¯x, 0) + h.o.t
is a n.f. for (2.8) up to second order terms. The rest of the proof follows
by induction.
Since A is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup, it is a
closed operator. This implies that the extension ˜A is also a closed oper-
ator. Note that the restriction AQ1 = ˜A|Q1 is an operator acting in the
Banach space Ker π, therefore AQ1 is also closed. Thus, it is straightfor-
ward to prove that M2
j , j ≥2, are closed operators in the Banach space
V p
j (Ker π), so M2
j are one-to-one and onto if and only if 0 ̸∈σ(M2
j ).
The spectra of the operators M2
j are given in the theorem below.
Theorem 2.4. With the above notations,
(i) σP (M2
j ) = {(q, ¯λ) −µ : µ ∈σ(A1
Q), q ∈Dj};
(ii) σ(M2
j ) = σP (M2
j ),
where: Dj = {q ∈Np
0 : |q| = j}; |q| = q1 + · · · + qp for q = (q1, . . . , qp);
¯λ = (λ1, . . . , λp) where λ1, . . . , λp are the eigenvalues in Λ, counting
multiplicities; (q, ¯λ) = q1λ1 + · · · + qpλp.
Proof. The complete proof of this theorem can be found in [44]. (See
also [45] for the situation of DDEs with parameters.) Here we give only
a sketch of the proof.
237

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
By adapting the algebraic arguments for ﬁnite ODEs in [29, Chap-
ter 12], one can prove (i). To prove (ii), it is suﬃcient to show that if
α ̸∈σP (M2
j ), then the operator αI −M2
j is surjective. In order to prove
this, consider the set Dj with the following order: for q = (q1, . . . , qp)
and ℓ= (ℓ1, . . . , ℓp) in Dj, we say that q < ℓif the ﬁrst non-zero diﬀer-
ence q1 −ℓ1, . . . , qp −ℓp is positive. In this order, (j, 0, . . . , 0) is the ﬁrst
element in Dj, and (0, . . . , 0, j) is the last element.
Let α ̸∈σP (M2
j ). From (i), we deduce that µq := (q, ¯λ)−α ∈ρ(AQ1)
for all q ∈Dj. Fix g = 
q∈Dj gqxq ∈V p
j (Ker π). By induction in Dj
ordered as above, for any q ∈Dj it is possible to construct
h(q) =

ℓ∈Dj
hℓxℓ
such that
[(αI −M2
j )h(q)]ℓ= gℓ
for
ℓ≤q.
For q the last element of Dj, we get (αI −M2
j )h(q) = g, proving that
αI −M2
j is surjective.
Corollary 2.5. The operators M2
j deﬁned in (2.13) are one-to-one and
onto if and only if
(q, ¯λ) ̸= µ,
for all µ ∈σ(A) \ Λ and q ∈Dj.
(2.17j)
Proof. From Theorem 2.4 and Lemma 2.2 it follows immediately that
0 ̸∈σP (M2
j ) = σ(M2
j ) if and only if (2.17j) holds.
Conditions (2.17j) are called non-resonance conditions of order j,
relative to the set Λ.
Theorem 2.6.
Let Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ = 0} ̸= ∅, and BC be
decomposed by Λ, BC ≡Rp × Ker π. Then, there is a formal change of
variables of the form
(x, y) = (¯x, ¯y) + O(|¯x|2),
such that:
(i) Eq. (2.9) is transformed into Eq. (2.12) where g2
j (¯x, 0) = 0, j ≥2;
(ii) a local centre manifold for this system at zero satisﬁes ¯y = 0;
(iii) the ﬂow on it is given by the ODE in Rp

(2.18)
which is in normal form (in the usual sense of n.f. for ODEs).
238

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Proof. For the choice Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ = 0}, clearly the non-
resonance conditions (2.17j) hold for any j ≥2. Therefore, Im (M2
j ) =
V p
j (Ker π) and Ker (M2
j ) = {0}, j ≥2. From (2.14), we can choose U2
j
such that g2
j (x, 0) = ˜f2
j (x, 0) −(M2
j U2
j )(x) = 0. Theorem 2.3 implies
that the centre manifold is given by equation ¯y = 0 (up to a certain
order k, if F is Ck-smooth), and that the ﬂow on this manifold is given
by (2.18), which is an ODE in n.f..
For other choices of ﬁnite nonempty sets Λ ⊂σ(A), this n.f. proce-
dure is justiﬁed if the non-resonance conditions hold.
Theorem 2.7. Let Λ ⊂σ(A) be a nonempty ﬁnite set. If the nonres-
onance conditions (2.17j) hold for j ≥2, the statements in the above
theorem are valid for the invariant manifold for (2.1) associated with Λ,
provided that this manifold exists.
Deﬁnition 2.8.
If the nonresonance conditions (2.17j), j ≥2, are
satisﬁed, Eq. (2.12) is said to be a normal form for Eq. (2.9) (or Eq.
(2.1)) relative to Λ if gj = (g1
j , g2
j ) are deﬁned by
gj(x, y) = ˜fj(x, y) −MjUj(x),
with Uj = (U1
j , U2
j ),
U2
j (x) = (M2
j )−1 ˜f2
j (x, 0)
and U1
j (j ≥2) are chosen according to the method of n. f. for ﬁnite
dimensional ODEs: i.e.,
g1
j (x, 0) = (I −P 1
j ) ˜f1
j (x, 0),
U1
j (x) = (M1
j )−1P 1
j ˜f1
j (x, 0), j ≥2,
where P 1
j : V p
j (Rp) →Im(M1
j ) is the canonical projection associated
with a decomposition V p
j (Rp) = Im(M1
j ) ⊕Im(M1
j )c, and (M1
j )−1 :
Im(M1
j ) →Ker (M1
j )c is the right inverse of M1
j for a decomposition
V p
j (Rp) = Ker (M1
j ) ⊕Ker (M1
j )c.
Remark 2.9. Note that P 1
j and (M1
j )−1 depend on the choices of com-
plementary spaces for Im (M1
j ) and Ker (M1
j ) in V p
j (Rp), respectively.
On the other hand, if F ∈Ck for some k ≥2, and the nonresonance
conditions of order j, 2 ≤j ≤k, hold, one can compute Eq. (2.16), a
n.f. relative to Λ up to k-order terms.
Remark 2.10. The terms g1
j (x, 0) in the n.f. are recursively computed
in terms of the coeﬃcients of the original FDE, according to the following
scheme: in the ﬁrst step (j = 2), we have ˜f1

compute g1
2(x, 0) = (I −P 1

Equations with parameters
For studying bifurcation problems, we need to consider situations
with parameters:
˙u(t) = L(α)(ut) + F(ut, α),
(2.20)
where α ∈V, V is a neighbourhood of zero in Rm, and L : V →
L(C; Rn), F : C × V →Rn are respectively Ck−1 and Ck functions,
k ≥2, F(0, α) = 0, D1F(0, α) = 0, for all α ∈V . As usual, L(C; Rn)
denotes the space of bounded linear operators from C to R, with the
operator norm. Introducing the parameter α as a variable by adding
˙α = 0, we write (2.20) as
˙u(t) = L0(ut) + (L(α) −L0)(ut) + F(ut, α)
( ˙α(t) = 0),
(2.21)
where L0 := L(0). Clearly the phase space for (2.21) is C([−r, 0]; Rn+m).
Its linearization around the origin is

˙u(t)
˙α(t)

=

L0(ut)
0

.
Note that the term (L(α) −L0)(ut) is no longer of the ﬁrst order, since
α is taken as a variable.
Consider a ﬁnite nonempty set Λ ⊂σ(A) such that 0 ∈Λ if 0 ∈
σ(A), and let C = P ⊕Q be decomposed by Λ. Writing the Taylor
expansions
L(α)(u) = L0u + L1(α)u + 1
2L2(α)u + · · ·
F(u, α) = 1
2F2(u, α) + 1
3!F3(u, α) + · · · ,
u ∈C, α ∈V,
the term of order j in the variables (u, α) for (2.21) is given by
1
(j −1)!Lj−1(α)u + 1
j!Fj(u, α).
240

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Therefore, the terms (2.10) for the equation (2.6) in BC read now as
f1
j (x, y, α) = Ψ(0)[jLj−1(α)(Φx + y) + Fj(Φx + y, α)],
f2
j (x, y, α) = (I −π)X0[jLj−1(α)(Φx + y) + Fj(Φx + y, α)].
(2.22)
The above procedure can now be applied to compute n.f. for (2.11). See
[45] for details.
2.5
More about normal forms for FDEs in Rn
In [99], the n.f. theory presented here was generalized to construct
n.f. for neutral FDEs of the form
d
dt

D(ut) −G(ut)

= L(ut) + F(ut),
(2.23)
where ut ∈C, D, L are bounded linear operators from C to Rn, with
Dφ = φ(0) −
 0
−r d[µ(θ)]φ(θ) and µ is non-atomic at zero, µ(0) = 0,
and G, F are Ck functions , k ≥2. Following the ideas above, in [99]
the inﬁnitesimal generator general A for the semigroup deﬁned by the
solutions of the linear equation
d
dtD(ut) = L(ut)
was naturally extended to
˜A : C1 ⊂BC →BC,
˜Aϕ = ˙ϕ + X0[L(ϕ) −D ˙ϕ],
(2.24)
where D( ˜A) = C1. Fix e.g. Λ as the set of eigenvalues of A on the
imaginary axis, and consider C = P ⊕Q and BC = P ⊕Ker π decom-
posed by Λ. Since the projection π in (2.4) still commutes in C1 with
the operator ˜A given by (2.24), in BC (2.23) is written as the abstract
ODE
˙v = ˜Av + X0[F(v) + G′(v)˙v],
and decomposition (2.5) yields

˙x = Bx + Ψ(0)[F(Φx + y) + G′(Φx + y)(Φ ˙x + ˙y)]
˙y = AQ1y + (I −π)X0[F(Φx + y) + G′(Φx + y)(Φ ˙x + ˙y)],
x ∈Rp, y ∈Q1,
where AQ1 is the restriction of ˜A to Q1 interpreted as an operator acting
in the Banach space Ker π. Deﬁne again the operators M1
j , M2
j by the
formal expression (2.13), where now ˜A is as in (2.24). Lemmas 2.1 and
2.2 are true in this framework. The method for computing n.f. on centre
241

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
manifolds (or other invariant manifolds) for neutral equations (2.23) is
then developed in [99] along the lines of the method for FDEs (2.1).
It would also be very important to generalize the above method to
construct n.f. around periodic orbits for autonomous retarded FDEs on
C = C([−r, 0]; Rn)
˙u(t) = f(ut),
(2.25)
with f ∈Ck(k ≥2).
Suppose that p(t) is an ω-periodic solution of
(2.25). Through the change u(t) = p(t) + x(t), (2.25) becomes
˙x(t) = L(t)xt + F(t, xt),
(2.26)
where L(t) = Df(pt) and F(t, ϕ) = f(pt + ϕ) −f(pt) −Df(pt) are
ω-periodic functions in t.
The major diﬃculty when trying to generalize the theory of n.f. to
an FDE of the form (2.26) is that its linear part is non-autonomous. In
[35], the theory was developed for the particular case of equations (2.26)
with autonomous linear part,
˙x(t) = Lxt + F(t, xt).
(2.27)
Clearly, condition L(t) ≡L is very restrictive. However, in this case, the
work in [35] provides a strong result.
Theorem 2.11. With the above notations, let Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ =
0} and assume Λ is nonempty. If the nonresonance conditions
(q, ¯λ) + ik ̸= µ,
for all µ ∈σ(A) \ Λ, k ∈Z, q ∈Dj, j ≥2
are satisﬁed, the normal form on the centre manifold for (2.27) coincides
with the normal form for the averaged equation
˙x(t) = Lxt + F0(xt),
where

To treat the general periodic case (2.26), it may be useful to use
the work of Hale and Weedermann [59], where a suitable system of co-
ordinates was established, and used to deduce a natural decomposition
of C. If the new coordinates allow us to decompose also the enlarged
phase space BC, then (2.26) can be written as an abstract ODE in BC.

Normal forms and Bifurcation Problems
In this section we illustrate the application of the method of n.f. to
the study of Bogdanov-Takens and Hopf bifurcations for general scalar
FDEs. In the framework of FDEs in Rn, n ≥2, with one or two discrete
delays, for other examples of applications of n.f. to bifurcation problems
see e.g. [38, 40, 41, 47, 57, 102, 103].
3.1
The Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation
We start by studying the Bogdanov-Takens singularity for a general
scalar FDE. In C = C([−r, 0]; R), consider
˙u(t) = L(α)ut + F(ut, α),
(3.1)
where α = (α1, α2) ∈V ⊂R2, V a neighbourhood of zero, L : V →
L(C; R) is C1, F : C × V →R is C2, F(0, α) = 0, D1F(0, α) = 0 for
α ∈V .
Let L(0) = L0. For the linearization at u = 0, α = 0, we assume:
(H1) λ = 0 is a double characteristic value of ˙u(t) = L0ut:
L0(1) = 0, L0(θ) = 1, L0(θ2) ̸= 0;
(H2) all other characteristic values of ˙u(t) = L0ut have non-zero real
parts
Above and throughout this section, we often abuse the notation and
write L0(ϕ(θ)) for L0(ϕ), ϕ ∈C.
With the notations in Section 2, ﬁx Λ = {0}, and let C = P ⊕Q,
BC = P ⊕Ker π be decomposed by Λ. Choose bases Φ and Ψ for the
the centre space P of ˙u(t) = L0ut, and for its dual P ∗:
P = span Φ,
Φ(θ) = (1, θ),
θ ∈[−r, 0],
P ∗= span Ψ,
Ψ(s) =

ψ1(0) −sψ2(0)
ψ2(0)

,
s ∈[0, r],
with (Ψ, Φ) = I if
ψ1(0) = L0(θ2/2)−2L0(θ3/3!),
ψ2(0) = −L0(θ2/2)−1.

Also, ˙Φ = ΦB, −˙Ψ = BΨ for

Thus, for α = 0 the 2-dimensional ODE on the centre manifold has a
Bogdanov-Takens singularity. Consequently its dynamics around u = 0
are generically determined by its quadratic terms [24, 29].
Consider the Taylor expansions
L(α) = L0 + L1(α) + O(|α|2),
F(u, α) = 1
2F2(u, α) + O(|u|3 + |α||u|2).
From Theorem 2.6 (see also Remark 2.9), we deduce that the n.f. up to
quadratic terms on the centre manifold of the origin near α = 0 is given
by
˙x = Bx + 1
2g1
2(x, 0, α) + h.o.t.,

and

λ2 =ψ1(0)L1(α)(1) + ψ2(0)L1(α)(θ).
(3.4)
We remark that the bifurcation parameters λ1, λ2 and the coeﬃcients
B1, B2 are explicitly computed in terms of the coeﬃcients in the original
equation (3.1). Also, the new bifurcating parameters λ1, λ2 are linearly
independent. We summarize the above computations in the following
result:
Theorem 3.1. For α small, the ﬂow on the centre manifold for (3.1) is
given by the n. f. (up to quadratic terms)

˙x1= x2 + h.o.t
˙x2= λ1x1 + λ2x2 + B1x2
1 + B2x1x2 + h.o.t,
(3.5)
where the coeﬃcients B1, B2 and the new bifurcating parameters λ1, λ2
are as in (3.3) and (3.4). Furthermore, if B1B2 ̸= 0, (3.5) exhibits a
generic Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation from u = 0, α = 0.
The bifurcation diagram for the ﬂow on the centre manifold depends
on the signs of B1, B2. For instance, let B1 < 0 and B2 > 0. Then in
245

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
the (λ1, λ2)-bifurcation diagram, the Hopf bifurcation curve H and the
homoclinic bifurcation curve HL lie in the region λ1 > 0, λ2 < 0, with H
to the left of HL, and both the homoclinic loop and the periodic orbit
are asymptotically stable. (See e.g. [24, 29]).
Example 3.2. Consider the scalar DDE
˙u(t) = a1u(t) −a2u(t −1) + au2(t) + bu(t)u(t −1) + cu2(t −1), (3.6)
where a1, a2, a, b, c ∈R. The characteristic equation for its linearization
at zero, ˙u(t) = a1u(t) −a2u(t −1), is given by
∆(λ) := λ −a1 + a2e−λ = 0.
One can check that λ = 0 is a double characteristic value, i.e., ∆(0) =
0, ∆′(0) = 0 and ∆′′(0) ̸= 0, if and only if a1 = a2 = 1.
Rescaling the parameters by setting α1 = a1 −1, α2 = a2 −1, α =
(α1, α2) ∈R2, (3.6) becomes
˙u(t) = u(t)−u(t−1)+α1u(t)−α2u(t−1)+au2(t)+bu(t)u(t−1)+cu2(t−1),
so it has the form (2.21), with the linear terms in (ut, α) ∈C × R2
given by L0(ut), and non-linear terms L1(α)(ut)+F(ut), where L0(ϕ) =
ϕ(0) −ϕ(−1), L1(α)(ϕ) = α1ϕ(0) −α2ϕ(−1) and F(ϕ) = aϕ2(0) +
bϕ(0)ϕ(−1) + cϕ(−1)2, for ϕ ∈C = C([−1, 0]; R).
Fix Λ = {0}, and consider dual basis Φ, Ψ as above. We get ψ1(0) =
2/3, ψ2(0) = 2 from (3.2), and F2(Φx, 0)/2 = (a+b+c)x2
1−(b+2c)x1x2+
cx2
2.
Applying formulas (3.3)-(3.4), we deduce that the ODE on the
centre manifold of the origin near α = 0 is given in n.f. by (3.5) with
B1 = 2(a + b + c),
B2 = 2
3(2a −b −4c)
λ1 = 2(α1 −α2),
λ2 = 2
3(α1 + 2α2).
3.2
Hopf bifurcation
We study the generic Hopf bifurcation for the general scalar case.
In the phase space C = C([−r, 0]; R), consider
˙u(t) = L(α)ut + F(ut, α),
(3.7)
where α ∈V , V a neighbourhood of zero in R, L : V →L(C; R) is C2,
and F : C × V →R is C3, F(0, α) = 0, D1F(0, α) = 0 for α ∈V .
246

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
For ˙u(t) = L(α)(ut), assume that:
(H1) there is a pair of simple characteristic roots γ(α)±iω(α) for ˙u(t) =
L(α)ut crossing transversely the imaginary axis at α = 0:
γ(0) = 0,
ω := ω(0) > 0,
γ′(0) ̸= 0
(Hopf condition);
(H2) for α = 0, there are no other characteristic roots with zero real
parts.
With the notations above, and using complex coordinates, C is
decomposed by Λ = {iω, −iω} as C = P ⊕Q, where the dual bases Φ, Ψ
for P, P ∗can be chosen as
P = span Φ,
Φ(θ) = (ϕ1(θ), ϕ2(θ)) = (eiωθ, e−iωθ),

Note that ˙Φ = ΦB, −˙Ψ = BΨ for
B =

Since B is a diagonal matrix, because of the use of complex coordinates,
the operators M1
j have a diagonal matrix representation in the canonical

V 3

The Hopf condition assures that a Hopf bifurcation occurs on a two

is determined up to cubic terms. Applying the method of n.f., we have

It remains to determine ProjS[(Dyf1

C →C be the bilinear symmetric form such that
F2(u, α) = F2(u, 0) = H2(u, u),
u ∈C
(i.e., F2(u, 0) is the quadratic form associated with H2(u, v)). Then,
(Dyf1

Deﬁne h = h(x)(θ) by h(x) = U2

h(x) = h20x2

where h20, h11, h02 ∈Q1. Using the deﬁnition of M2

Dxh(x)Bx −AQ1(h(x)) = (I −π)X0F2(Φx, 0),

˙h(x)(0) −L0h(x) = F2(Φx, 0),

From this system, we deduce
h02 = h20, h11 = h11, and two initial value problems (IVPs),

There is a pair of (simple) imaginary roots ±iω for (3.20) if and only if
a = aN and ω = ωN, where
aN = (−1)NωN,
ωN = π
2 + Nπ,
N ∈N0.
With α = a −aN, (3.19) is written as
˙u(t) = −aNu(t −1) + αu(t −1) + F(ut, α),
(3.21)
where F(v, α) = −(aN + α)v(0)v(−1). Set Λ = {iωN, −iωN}. For ψ(0)
as in (3.8), ψ1(0) = 1−iωN

N . Write the Taylor formulas
L(α)v = L0v + L1(α)v,
F(v, α) = 1
2F2(v, α) + 1
3!F3(v, α),
where L0(v) = −aNv(−1), L1(α)v = −αv(−1) and 1
2F2(v, α) = −aNv(0)
v(−1), F3(v, α) = −αv(0)v(−1). Applying Theorem 3.3, we obtain the
n.f. on the center manifold of the origin near a = aN given in polar
coordinates by Eq. (3.16), with
K1 =
aN
1 + a2
N
,
K2 =

5(1 + a2
N)[(−1)N −3ωn] < 0,
for
N ∈N0.
Thus, a generic Hopf bifurcation for (3.19) occurs from u = 0, a = aN.
Since K2 < 0 for all N ∈N0, the bifurcating periodic orbits are always
stable inside the centre manifold.
On the other hand, K1 > 0 if N
even, thus K1K2 < 0, and the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical. If N is
odd, K1 < 0, thus the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical. E.g., at the ﬁrst
bifurcating point a = a0 = π/2 (N = 0), we have Λ = {iπ/2, −iπ/2},
and
K1 =

4 + π2 > 0,
K2 = π(2 −3π)
5(4 + π2) < 0.

Normal Forms for FDEs in Hilbert Spaces
In the following, X is a real or complex Hilbert space with inner
product < ·, · > and C = C([−r, 0]; X) (r > 0) is the Banach space
of continuous maps from [−r, 0] to X with the sup norm.
In order
to simplify the notation, ﬁx R as the scalar ﬁeld.
Write ut ∈C for
ut(θ) = u(t + θ), −r ≤θ ≤0, and consider FDEs in X given in abstract
form as
˙u(t) = AT u(t) + L(ut) + F(ut)
(t ≥0),
(4.1)
where AT : D(AT ) ⊂X →X is a linear operator, L ∈L(C; X), i.e.,
L : C →X is a bounded linear operator, and F : C →X is a Ck
function (k ≥2) such that F(0) = 0, DF(0) = 0.
We are particularly interested in equations (4.1), since they include
reaction-diﬀusion (RD) equations with delays appearing in the reaction
terms. Equations involving both time delays and spatial diﬀusion have
been increasingly used in population dynamics, neural networks, disease
modelling, and other ﬁelds.
A typical example of a RD-equation with delays is the so-called
logistic equation with delays and spatial diﬀusion. In the framework of
ODEs, consider the logistic equation ˙x = ax(1 −bx), where a is the
growth rate of the population and K = 1/b the “carrying capacity”.
Taking into account the maturation period r > 0 of the population, the
model becomes
˙x(t) = ax(t)[1 −bx(t −r)],
known as the Hutchinson equation. Translating the positive equilibrium
1/b to the origin and eﬀecting a scaling, y(t) = bx(t) −1, we get the
Wright equation (conf. Example 3.4)
˙y(t) = −ay(t −r)[1 + y(t)].
Considering also a spatial variable x ∈[0, 1], and diﬀusion terms, we
obtain the model
∂v
∂t (t, x) = d∂2v
∂x2 −av(t −r, x)[1 + v(t, x)],
t > 0, x ∈(0, 1),
to which boundary conditions, such as Neumann or Dirichlet conditions,
should be added. This RD-equation is often used as a model in popula-
tion dynamics, where v stands for the density of the population spread
over the interval [0, 1], d is the diﬀusion rate that measures the internal
migration of the population, and a, b, r have the same meaning as before.

4.1
Linear FDEs
For the linearized equation about the equilibrium zero
˙u(t) = AT u(t) + L(ut),
(4.2)
we assume in this section the following hypotheses (see [73, 77, 101, 104]):
(H1) AT generates a C0-semigroup of linear operators {T(t)}t≥0 on X;
(H2) T(t) is a compact operator for t > 0;
(H3) the eigenfunctions {βk}∞
k=1 of AT , with corresponding eigenvalues
{µk}∞
k=1, form an orthonormal basis for X;
(H4) the subspaces Bk of C, Bk := {ϕβk | ϕ ∈C([−r, 0]; R)}, satisfy
L(Bk) ⊂span{βk}, k ∈N.
For a straightforward generalization of these assumptions to equa-
tions (4.2) in Banach spaces see [101, Chapter 3]. For a weaker version
of (H4) see [36].
Hypothesis (H4) roughly requires that the operator L does not mix
the spatial variations described by eigenvectors βk of AT . This condition
is very restrictive in terms of applications, since it almost imposes that
L is a scalar multiplication. In Section 5 of the present text, normal
forms are developed for FDEs in Banach spaces without imposing (H3)-
(H4). Nevertheless, the situation where (H1)-(H4) hold will be studied
separately in this section since it provides a strong result: eventually
under additional conditions, for (4.1) it is possible to associate an FDE
in Rn, whose n.f. on invariant manifolds coincide with n.f. on invariant
manifolds for (4.1), up to some order. This allows us to apply to (4.1)
the n.f. method for FDEs in Rn described in Section 2 without further
computations.
As for retarded FDEs in Rn, we start by looking for solutions of the
linear equation (4.2) of the exponential type,
u(t) = eλty,
y ∈D(AT ).
Clearly u(t) as above is a non-trivial solution of (4.2) if and only if λ, y
satisfy the characteristic equation
∆(λ)y = 0,
λ ∈C, y ∈D(AT ) \ {0},
(4.3)
where the characteristic operator ∆(λ) is deﬁned by
∆(λ) : D(AT ) ⊂X →X,
∆(λ)y = λy −AT y −L(eλ·y).
254

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Let A be the inﬁnitesimal generator associated with the semiﬂow
of the linearized equation (4.2). It is well-known ([73, 77, 92, 101, 104])
that its eigenvalues are exactly the roots of the characteristic equation
(4.3), that the spectrum of A is reduced to the point spectrum and that,
for each α ∈R, the set σ(A) ∩{λ ∈C : Re λ ≥α} is ﬁnite.
Since (H4) states that L does not mix the modes of eigenvalues
of AT , and from (H3) X can be decomposed by {βk}∞
k=1, we deduce
that equation ∆(λ)y = 0 is equivalent to the sequence of characteristic
equations
λ −µk −Lk(eλ·) = 0
(k ∈N),
(4.4k)
where Lk : C([−r, 0]; R) →R are deﬁned by Lk(ψ)βk = L(ψβk), for
k ∈N.
Again, for the sake of applications, we ﬁx Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ =
0} ̸= ∅, and let P be the centre space for (4.2). Since Λ is a ﬁnite set,
there exists N ∈N, such that Λ = {λ ∈C : λ is a solution of (4.4k)
with Re λ = 0, for some k ∈{1, . . . , N}}.
We describe brieﬂy an adjoint theory for FDEs (4.2) as in [73, 77],
assuming the above hypotheses. The main idea is to relate the eigenval-
ues of the inﬁnitesimal generator A (in this case, only the elements of Λ)
with the eigenvalues of certain scalar FDEs. On Bk, the linear equation
˙u(t) = AT u(t) + L(ut) is equivalent to the FDE on R
˙z(t) = µkz(t) + Lkzt ,
(4.5k)
with characteristic equation given by (4.4k), k ∈N. With this identiﬁ-
cation, the standard adjoint theory for retarded FDEs can be used to
decompose C, in the following way. For 1 ≤k ≤N, deﬁne (·, ·)k as
the adjoint bilinear form on C([0, r]; R∗) × C([−r, 0]; R) associated with
(4.5k), and decompose C([−r, 0]; R) by Λk := {λ ∈C : λ satisﬁes (4.4k)
and Re λ = 0} as in Section 2.1 (see [58]):
C([−r, 0]; R) = Pk ⊕Qk ,
Pk = spanΦk ,
P ∗
k = spanΨk ,
(Ψk, Φk)k = I ,
dimPk = dimP ∗
k := mk , ˙Φk = ΦkBk ,
where Pk is the centre space for (4.5k) and Bk is an mk × mk constant
matrix. For each k ∈N, the projection Pk ⊕Qk →Pk, u →Φk(Ψk, u)k
induces a projection
C →Pkβk,
ϕ →Φk(Ψk, < ϕ(·), βk >)kβk.
We use the above decompositions to decompose C by Λ:
C = P ⊕Q ,
P = Im π ,
Q = Ker π,

4.2
Normal forms
As for retarded FDEs in Rn, we ﬁrst enlarge the phase space so
that (4.1) can be written as an abstract ODE, along the lines of Section
2. Denote by X0 the function deﬁned by X0(0) = I, X0(θ) = 0 , −r ≤
θ < 0, where I is the identity operator on X, and let
BC ≡C × X = {φ + X0α : φ ∈C, α ∈X}.
In BC, (4.1) reads as an abstract ODE,
d
dtv = ˜Av + X0F(v),
(4.6)
where ˜A is the extension of the inﬁnitesimal generator A deﬁned by
˜A : C1
0 ⊂BC −→BC
D( ˜A) = C1
0 := {φ ∈C : ˙φ ∈C, φ(0) ∈D(AT )}
˜Aφ = ˙φ + X0[L(φ) + AT φ(0) −˙φ(0)].
We further consider the extension of the projection π : C →P to BC,
still denoted by π, by deﬁning
π(X0α) =
N

k=1
ΦkΨk(0) < α, βk > βk,
α ∈X.
By using π, the enlarged space BC is decomposed by Λ as
BC = P ⊕Ker π,
with Q ⊂Ker π and P ⊂C1
0. One can prove that π is continuous and
commutes with ˜A in C1
0. For v ∈C1
0, using the above decomposition,
we write
v(t) =

with xk(t) ∈R, 1 ≤k ≤N, y ∈C1

Hence, Eq.
(4.6) is decomposed as a system of abstract ODEs on

Recall that the existence of a local centre manifold for (4.1) tangent
to P at zero was proven under (H1)-(H4) in [73], following the approach
in [77].
For (4.1) written in the form (4.7), it is possible to develop a normal
form theory for FDEs in X based on the theory in Section 2. Formally,
the operators M1

The associated FDE on RN

If we compare Eq. (4.7) with Eq. (2.6), it is natural to associate
an FDE in RN with the original FDE (4.1). In fact, formally we relate
(4.7) with the DDE in RN

However, the operators ˜A and π are deﬁned diﬀerently in (4.7) and (4.8).
On the other hand, in order to derive the linear terms in (4.8) from the
procedure in Section 2.2, the linearization of the original FDE in RN
(2.1) should have the form ˙u(t) = R(ut), with R ∈L(CN; RN) deﬁned
by
R(φ) = (µkφk(0) + Lk(φk))N

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
The relevance of this associated FDE in RN is summarized in the
next theorem.
Theorem 4.2. [37] Consider Eq. (4.1), and assume (H1)-(H4).
(i) if F is of class C2, then, for a suitable change of variables, the
n.f. on the centre manifold for both (4.1) and (4.11) is the same, up to
second order terms;
(ii) if F is of class C3, F(v) = 1
2!F2(v) + 1
3!F3(v) + o(|v|3), and
Proj span{β1,...,βN}DF2(u)(φβj) = 0 , for j ≥N+1, u ∈P, φ ∈C([−r, 0]; R), (H5)
then, for a suitable change of variables, the n.f. on the centre manifold
for both (4.1) and (4.11) are the same, up to third order terms.
Note that assumption (H5) can also be written as
< DF2(u)(φβj), βp >= 0 , for 1 ≤p ≤N, j > N and all u ∈P, φ ∈C([−r, 0]; R).
The proof of this theorem is based on the possibility of identifying
the operators M1
j , M2
j of the n.f.
algorithm for (4.1) with the corre-
sponding operators appearing in the computation of n.f. relative to Λ
for (4.11). The above result is not completely surprising. In fact, note
that (H4) can be interpreted as nonresonance conditions of ﬁrst order,
in the sense that it imposes nonresonances inside the linear part of the
equation, between L and the operator AT . Now recall that second or-
der terms of n.f. are computed by looking at second order terms in the
equation for x ∈RN. The cubic terms of n.f. are obtained by using not
only second and third order terms in the equation for x ∈RN, but also
second order terms in the equation for y ∈Ker π. Therefore, it is not
surprising to expect the quadratic terms in the n.f. for the ﬂow on the
centre manifold for both equations (4.1) and (4.11) to be the same. On
the other hand, it is natural to expect that additional nonresonance con-
ditions of second order should be imposed, in order to derive the same
result for cubic terms. The role of (H5) is to impose such nonresonance
conditions, between the second order terms of F and the eigenspaces for
AT . Of course, we could derive other nonresonance conditions between
the j-order terms (j ≤k −1) of F and the eigenspaces for AT , in order
to conclude that the n.f. on the centre manifold for both (4.1) and (4.11)
are the same up to k order terms. In the present framework, Theorem
4.2 is particularly relevant, since it enables us to reduce the computation
of n.f. for FDEs in Hilbert spaces X to the computation of n.f. for FDEs
in ﬁnite dimensional spaces. Moreover, even if (H5) fails, one can prove
259

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
[37] that the associated FDE by Λ (4.11) still carries much information
that can be used when computing n.f. for (4.1).
4.4
Applications to bifurcation problems
Population dynamics models involving memory and diﬀusion in one
spatial variable are often given by equations of the form
∂u(t, x)
∂t
= d∂2u(t, x)
∂x2
+ a(x)u(t, x) + b(x)u(t −r, x)
+ c0(x)u(t, x)u(t −r, x),
t > 0, x ∈(ℓ1, ℓ2),
with either Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions on [ℓ1, ℓ2] ⊂R,
and initial condition
u0 = ϕ ∈C = C([−r, 0]; X).
For the choice e.g. X = L2[ℓ1, ℓ2] , the problem is not well-posed,
since L2[ℓ1, ℓ2] is not a Banach algebra. However, the question of exis-
tence of solutions will not be addressed here, since that is not the aim
of the n.f. theory. In order to guarantee existence of solutions, there
are several approaches. One can restrict the state space to an appro-
priate space of functions invariant under products, e.g. X = C[ℓ1, ℓ2]
or X = W 2,2[ℓ1, ℓ2] [73, 77, 101].
Another possibility is to consider
a fractional power (AT )β of AT (0 < β < 1), and take as the Ba-
nach state space the fractional power space Xβ = D(Aβ), with norm
∥v∥β = ∥(AT )βv∥; and Cβ = C([−1, 0]; Xβ) as the phase space. This
theory is well established since the work of Henry [63].
See also [
[46, 54, 93, 94]. Another procedure is to consider X = L2[ℓ1, ℓ2], and re-
strict the space of initial conditions that are chosen in a natural “initial-
history” space [85, 86].
As an application, we shall consider the Wright equation with dif-
fusion. For an application of the n.f. theory to a 2-dimensional RD-
equation with two delays, see [40].
Example 4.3. Consider the Wright equation with diﬀusion and Neu-
mann conditions ([37, 73, 77, 104]):

The eigenvalues of AT = d∆are µk = −dk2, k ≥0, with corre-
sponding normalized eigenfunctions βk(x) =
cos(kx)
∥cos(kx)∥2,2 . One can easily
check that (H1)-(H4) hold. For the linearization of (4.13) about the equi-
librium u = 0, the characteristic equation is equivalent to the sequence
of characteristic equations
λ + ae−λ + dk2 = 0 , (k = 0, 1, . . . ).
(4.14k)
Yoshida [104] showed that for a < π/2, all roots have negative real
parts, thus the zero solution is asymptotically stable; for a = π/2 and
k = 0, there exists a unique pair of characteristic values on the imaginary
axis, ±iπ/2, that are simple roots, and that all the other characteristic
values of (4.14k), k ∈N0, have negative real parts. At the critical point
a = π/2, rescale the parameter by setting a = π/2 + α.
Since the
Hopf condition holds [104], i.e., there is a pair of eigenvalues crossing
transversely the imaginary axis at α = 0, a Hopf bifurcation occurs on
a 2-dimensional centre manifold.
Let Λ = {iπ/2, −iπ/2}.
With the above notations (except that
here k ∈N0 instead of k ∈N), N = 0, µ0 = 0, β0 =

Since
L(ψβ0) = −π
2 ψ(−1)β0, the operator L0 : C([−1, 0]; R) →R in (4.40),
corresponding to the eigenvalue µ0 = 0, is deﬁned by

with K1, K2 as in (3.22). Thus, a generic supercritical Hopf bifurcation

Normal Forms for FDEs in General Banach
Spaces
Consider again a semilinear FDE (4.1) in the phase space C :=
C([−r, 0]; X),
˙u(t) = AT u(t) + L(ut) + F(ut),
(5.1)
where now X is a general Banach space, AT : D(AT ) ⊂X →X is linear,
and F : C →X is Ck (k ≥2) with F(0) = 0, DF(0) = 0.
Before developing a normal form theory on an invariant manifold for
FDEs (5.1), it is necessary to establish two necessary technical tools: a
formal adjoint theory for linear equations, and the existence and smooth-
ness of centre manifolds for nonlinearly perturbed equations (5.1) ([43]).

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
5.1
Adjoint theory
Consider a linear FDE in C of the form
˙u(t) = AT u(t) + L(ut),
(5.2)
where AT , L are as in (5.1). In this section, we shall assume only the
following hypotheses:
(H1) AT generates a C0 semigroup of linear operators {T(t)}t≥0 on X;
(H2) T(t) is a compact operator for t > 0;
(H3) there exists a function η : [−r, 0] →L(X, X) of bounded variation
such that
L(ϕ) =
 0
−r
dη(θ)ϕ(θ),
ϕ ∈C.
Under (H1)-(H3), a complete formal adjoint theory was developed
in [43], and will be presented here, following some ideas in [16] and [92].
The adjoint theory for abstract FDEs was initiated in [92]. However, the
theory in [92] was quite incomplete and more hypotheses were assumed.
On the other hand, Arino and Sanchez [16] developed a complete formal
adjoint theory for equations ˙u(t) = L(ut). From the point of view of
the applications we have in mind, equations in the form (5.1) are more
interesting, since they include RD-equations with delays. In [16], the
authors worked only with characteristic values that are not in the es-
sential spectrum in order to obtain Fredholm operators, whereas in our
setting we will be dealing with compact operators. Note that, contrary
to the situation studied in Section 4, we are not imposing any conditions
which relate L with the eigenvalues for AT .
Consider the characteristic equation (4.3) for (5.2),
∆(λ)x = 0, x ∈D(AT ) \ {0}
(5.3)
where the characteristic operator ∆(λ) : D(AT ) ⊂X →X is deﬁned by
∆(λ)x = AT x + L(eλ·x) −λx.
We start by recalling the results in [92]. Consider the C0-semigroup
of linear operators {U(t)}t≥0, deﬁned by the mild solutions of (5.2) with
initial condition ϕ ∈C, U(t) : C →C, U(t)ϕ = ut(ϕ), and its inﬁnitesi-
mal generator A,
Aϕ = ˙ϕ,
D(A) = {ϕ ∈C : ˙ϕ ∈C, ϕ(0) ∈D(AT ), ˙ϕ(0) = AT ϕ(0) + L(ϕ)}.
263

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Travis and Webb [92] proved that U(t) is a compact operator for each
t > r and σ(A) = σP (A). From general results on C0-semigroups and
compact operators (see e.g. [84]), it follows that, for λ ∈σ(A),
C = Ker [(A −λI)m] ⊕Im [(A −λI)m],
(5.4)
where Im [(A −λI)m] is a closed subspace of C and Ker [(A −λI)m]
is the generalized eigenspace for A associated with λ, denoted as usual
by Mλ(A), with Mλ(A) ﬁnite dimensional. In particular, the ascent
and descent of A −λI are both equal to m, where m is the order of
λ as a pole of the resolvent R(λ; A) [90]. Our purpose now is to write
Im [(A −λI)m] in terms of a (formal) adjoint theory, in the sense that
a Fredholm alternative result should be established.
As seen in Section 4.1, λ is a characteristic value if and only λ is
an eigenvalue of A, and, in this case, there is x ∈D(AT ) \ {0} such that
u(t) = eλtx is a solution of (5.2). Thus,
Ker (A −λI) = {eλ·x : x ∈Ker ∆(λ)}.
(5.5)
We use the formal duality << ·, · >> in C∗× C introduced in [92]
as the bilinear form
<< α, ϕ >>=< α(0), ϕ(0) > −
 0
−r
 θ
0
< α(ξ −θ), dη(θ)ϕ(ξ) > dξ
where C∗:= C([0, r]; X∗), X∗is the dual of X, and < ·, · > is the usual
duality in X∗× X. Deﬁne the formal adjoint equation to (5.2) as
˙α(t) = −A∗
T α(t) −L∗(αt),
t ≤0,
(5.6)
where αt ∈C∗, αt(s) = α(t + s) for s ∈[0, r], A∗
T is the adjoint operator
for AT , L∗: C∗→X∗is given by L∗(α) =
 0
−r dη∗(θ)α(−θ), and η∗(θ)
is the adjoint for η(θ), η∗: [−r, 0] →L(X∗, X∗). Let A∗be the inﬁni-
tesimal generator associated with the ﬂow for (5.6). The operator A∗is
called the formal adjoint of A, since
<< A∗α, ϕ >>=<< α, Aϕ >> , for α ∈D(A∗), ϕ ∈D(A).
Inspired by the work of Hale [58,
Chapter 7] and [16], we now
introduce some auxiliary operators, that will be used ﬁrst of all to get an
explicit characterization of the null spaces and ranges for the operators
(A −λI)m and (A∗−λI)m. Let λ ∈C, j ∈N0, m ∈N, and deﬁne the

The proof of this theorem follows from direct computations, so it is
omitted. See [16, 58] for similar proofs.
We now establish some preliminary lemmas.
Lemma 5.2.
The characteristic operator ∆(λ) generates a compact
C0-semigroup of linear operators on X. Moreover, λ ∈σ(A) if and only
if 0 ∈σ(∆(λ)).
Proof. From (5.4), clearly λ ∈ρ(A) if and only if 0 is not an eigenvalue
of ∆(λ). On the other hand, ∆(λ) is the sum of AT , which generates
a compact C0-semigroup, with the bounded linear operator L0
λ −λI.
Hence, ∆(λ) generates a compact semigroup of linear operators on X
[84, p. 79]. This also implies that 0 ∈ρ(∆(λ)) iﬀ0 ̸∈σP (∆(λ)). Hence
λ ∈ρ(A) iﬀ0 ∈ρ(∆(λ)).
Lemma 5.3. Let λ ∈C and m ∈N. Then:
(i) if µ ∈ρ(∆(λ)), then µ ∈ρ(L(m)
λ
) and (L(m)
λ
−µI)−1 is a compact
operator;
265

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
(ii) Im (L(m)
λ
) is a closed subspace of Xm.
Proof. Let µ ∈ρ(∆(λ)). For m = 1, we have L(1)
λ
= ∆(λ), and from
Lemma 5.2 we conclude that this operator generates a compact C0-
semigroup. Thus, its resolvent R(∆(λ); µ) = [∆(λ)−µI]−1 is a compact
operator. The rest of the proof of (i) follows by induction. For the proof
of (ii), we use (i) and general spectral properties of compact operators.
See [43] for details.
Lemma 5.4. Let λ ∈C, m ∈N. Then,
dim Ker (L(m)
λ
) = dim Ker ((L(m)
λ
)∗)
(5.7)
Proof.
Let λ ∈σ(A).
From Lemma 5.2, 0 ∈σ(∆(λ)).
Fix any
µ ∈ρ(∆(λ)). From Lemma 5.3 we deduce that µ ∈ρ(L(m)
λ
). One can
prove that
Ker (L(m)
λ
) = Ker ((L(m)
λ
−µI)−1 + I
µ),
Ker ((L(m)
λ
)∗) = Ker ([(L(m)
λ
)∗−µI]−1 + I
µ).
(5.8)
where [(L(m)
λ
)∗−µI]−1 = [(L(m)
λ
−µI)−1]∗. Also from Lemma 5.3, we
have that (L(m)
λ
−µI)−1 is a compact operator, and from Schauder’s
theorem we conclude that its adjoint [(L(m)
λ
−µI)−1]∗is also a compact
operator. In particular,
dim Ker ((L(m)
λ
−µI)−1 + I
µ) = dim Ker ([(L(m)
λ
−µI)−1]∗+ I
µ). (5.9)
From (5.8) and (5.9), we obtain (5.7).
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.1 and Lemma 5.4, we
can now state the following:
Theorem 5.5. Let λ ∈C, m ∈N. Then,
dim Ker [(A −λI)m] = dim Ker [(A∗−λI)m].
In particular, σP (A) = σP (A∗), and for λ ∈σP (A),
dim Mλ(A) = dim Mλ(A∗),
and the ascents of both operators A −λI and A∗−λI are equal. That
is, if Mλ(A) = Ker [(A −λI)m], then Mλ(A∗) = Ker [(A∗−λI)m].
We are now in the position to state a “Fredholm alternative” result.
266

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Theorem 5.6. Let λ ∈σ(A), m ∈N. Then ψ ∈Im [(A −λI)m] if and
only if
<< α, ψ >>= 0
for all α ∈Ker [(A∗−λI)m].
Proof.
From Lemma 5.3, the ranges of L(m)
λ
are closed subspaces,
hence they coincide with the annihilator of the adjoint operator (L(m)
λ
)∗,
Im (L(m)
λ

From Theorem 5.1, ψ ∈Im [(A −λI)m] iﬀR(m)

ψ ∈Im [(A −λI)m] iﬀ

for all Y ∗∈Ker ((L(m)

By using the formal duality, for Y ∗= (y∗

proves that

ply that ψ ∈Ker [(A −λI)m] if and only if << α, ψ >>= 0 for all
α ∈Ker [(A∗−λI)m].
From the Fredholm alternative result in Theorem 5.6, we denote
Im [(A −λI)m] = Ker [(A∗−λI)m]⊥, where the orthogonality “⊥” is
relative to the formal duality << ·, · >>. For the particular case of m
being the ascent of A −λI, i.e., Ker [(A −λI)m] = Mλ(A), from (5.4)
we obtain the decomposition of the phase space C by λ ∈σ(A) given as
C = Pλ ⊕Qλ,
(5.10)
where Pλ := Mλ(A) and Qλ :=

Mλ(A∗)
⊥. It is straightforward to gen-
eralize this decomposition to a nonempty ﬁnite set Λ = {λ1, . . . , λs} ⊂
267

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
σ(A). For applications to bifurcation problems, we will as usual ﬁx
Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ = 0}. The decompositions (5.10), λ ∈Λ, yield a
decomposition of C by Λ as
C = P ⊕Q,
(5.11)
where
P = Mλ1(A) ⊕· · · ⊕Mλs(A)
Q =

P ∗⊥= {ϕ ∈C : << α, ϕ >>= 0, for all ∈P ∗}
and
P ∗= Mλ1(A∗) ⊕· · · ⊕Mλs(A∗).
Clearly P, Q are invariant subspaces under A and (5.2). One also proves
that for any m, r ∈N, if λ, µ ∈σ(A) and λ ̸= µ, then << α, ϕ >>= 0
for all α ∈Ker [(A∗−λI)m] and ϕ ∈Ker [(A −µI)r]. By using the
Fredholm alternative result, it is therefore possible to choose normalized
bases Φ, Ψ for P, P ∗,
Φ = (Φλ1, . . . , Φλs),
P = span Φ
Ψ =


Ψλ1

,
P ∗= span ΨΛ
where p = dim P = dim P ∗, such that << Ψ, Φ >>= Ip.
5.2
Normal forms on centre manifolds
Consider now Eq. (5.1), which can be interpreted as a perturbation
of (5.2), and assume that Λ = {λ ∈σ(A) : Re λ = 0} is nonempty. With
the above notations, P is the centre space for (5.2), and p = dim P.
Assuming F is a C1 function, in [69], the existence of a C1-smooth p-
dimensional centre manifold for (5.2) tangent to P at zero was proven.
The following centre manifold theorem states that actually the centre
manifold is Ck-smooth.
Theorem 5.7. [43, 69] For (5.1) with F a Ck (k ≥1) function, there is
a centre manifold Wc = {ϕ ∈C : ϕ = Φx + h(x), x ∈V }, where V is a
neighbourhood of 0 ∈Rp, and h : V →Q is a Ck-smooth function such
that h(0) = 0, Dh(0) = 0.
By using the decomposition (5.11), on Wc the ﬂow is given by the
ODE
˙x = Bx+ < Ψ(0), F(Φx + h(x)) >,
x ∈V,
where Φ, Ψ are normalized dual bases for bases of P, P ∗, and B is the
p × p matrix such that ˙Φ = ΦB, −˙Ψ = BΨ.
268

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Let Eq. (5.1) be written as the abstract ODE (4.6) in the enlarged
phase space BC introduced in Section 4. Recall the deﬁnition of the
extension ˜A of the inﬁnitesimal generator A. Deﬁne now an extension
of the canonical projection C = P ⊕Q →P,
π : BC →P,
π(ϕ + X0α) = Φ

<< Ψ, ϕ >> + < Ψ(0), α >

.
Again, π commutes with ˜A on C1
0 = D( ˜A). Hence BC is decomposed
by Λ as
BC = P ⊕Ker π.
(5.12)
For v(t) ∈C1
0 decomposed according to (5.12), v(t) = Φx(t) + y(t) with
x(t) =<< Ψ, v(t) >>∈Rp, y(t) = (I −π)v(t) ∈Ker π ∩C1
0 = Q∩C1
0 :=
Q1, Eq. (4.6) is equivalent to the system
3 ˙x = Bx+ < Ψ(0), F(Φx + y) >
˙y = AQ1y + (I −π)X0F(Φx + y)
(5.13)
where AQ1 = ˜A|Q1 is as in Section 4.
The algorithm of n.f. now follows along lines similar to the ones in
Section 2. Writing the formal Taylor expansion of F,
F(v) =

where now the terms of order j are given by

j = (I −π)X0F(Φx + y).
(5.14)
At each step j ≥2, a change of variables of the form
(x, y) = (¯x, ¯y) + 1

resonant terms of degree j vanish in the transformed equation. Formally,
the operators appearing in the n.f. process are still given by (2.13); how-
ever the operators π and AQ1 are as deﬁned in this subsection. Of course,
for these operators, results similar to the ones proven for the case of n.f.
for FDEs in Rn must be established. See [39] for complete proofs.

∂x2
+ kU(t, x)[1 −U(t −r, x)],
t > 0, x ∈(0, π),
(5.15)
where k > 0 and r > 0, we consider now Dirichlet conditions
U(t, 0) = U(t, π) = 0, t ≥0.
(5.16)
For (5.15) with Neumann conditions ∂U
∂x (0, t) = ∂U
∂x (π, t) = 0, t ≥0,
U(x, t) ≡1 is the unique positive steady state. In this case, the transla-
tion u = U −1 transforms (5.15) into

∂t
= ∂2u(x, t))
∂x2
−ku(x, t −r)[1 + u(x, t)],
t ≥0, x ∈(0, π),
already studied in Example 4.3.
Model (5.15)-(5.16) was ﬁrst studied by Green and Stech [50]. In
[50], it was proven that the equilibrium U = 0 is a global attractor of
all positive solutions if k ≤1; for k > 1, U = 0 becomes unstable, and
there is a unique positive spatially nonconstant equilibrium Uk, which is
locally stable if rk max{Uk(x) : x ∈[0, π]} < 1. This stability criterion
was improved to rk max{Uk(x) : x ∈[0, π]} < π/2 in [65]. In [23], the
authors showed that for k −1 > 0 small, there exists r(k) > 0 such
that Uk is locally stable if the delay r is less than r(k), and unstable for
r > r(k). They also proved that there is a sequence (rkn)n∈ν0 of Hopf
bifurcation points, where rk0 = r(k) is the ﬁrst bifurcation point.
The study of (5.15) is particularly diﬃcult when Dirichlet condi-
tions (5.16) are assumed. The main problem derives from the fact that,
since the equilibria Uk(x) are spatially nonconstant, the characteristic
equation associated with the linearization about Uk(x) is a second order
diﬀerential equation with nonconstant coeﬃcients, subject to constraints
given by the boundary conditions. In fact, the characteristic equation is
given by
∆(k, λ, r)y = 0,
y ∈H2
0 \ {0},
(5.17)
where
∆(k, λ, r) = D2 + k(1 −Uk) −ke−λrUk −λ,
with D2 =
∂2
∂x2 , X = L2[0, π], and H2
0 = H2
0[0, π] = {y ∈X | ˙y, ¨y ∈
X, y(0) = y(π) = 0}. In the next statement, we summarize the results
in [23].
270

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
Theorem 5.8.
[23] There exists a k∗> 1 such that for each ﬁxed
k ∈(1, k∗), the eigenvalue problem (5.17) has a solution (iν, r, y), with
ν ≥0, r > 0, y ∈H2
0 \ {0}, if and only if
ν = νk,
r = rkn, y = cyk (c ̸= 0),
n ∈N0,
where
νk = (k −1)hk,
with
hk →1
as
k →1+,
rkn = θk + 2nπ
νk
,
θk →π
2
as
k →1+,
yk →sin(·) in L2[0, π]
as
k →1+.
Furthermore, the characteristic values λ = iνk are simple roots of (5.17)
for r = rkn, and for k ∈(1, k∗) a Hopf bifurcation arises from the
equilibrium Uk as the delay r increases and crosses the critical points
r = rkn, n ∈N0.
In the above theorem, we emphasize that the stationary solutions
Uk, the eingenvalues iνk, −iνk, the eigenvectors yk, ¯yk, and the critical
values rkn, n ∈N0, are all known only implicitly.
The aim now is to determine the stability of the periodic solutions
near the positive steady state Uk arising from Hopf, as the delay crosses
rkn, n ∈N0. In [23] it was stated without proof that these periodic
solutions are stable on the centre manifold. The proof of this statement
was given in [42] by using n.f. techniques, where details of the results
below can be found.
Fix k > 1. Since we want to use the delay r as the bifurcating
parameter, it is convenient to normalize the delay by the time-scaling,
¯U(t, x) = U(rt, x), and choose C := C([−1, 0]; X) as the phase space.
After translating Uk to the origin, for u(t) = ¯U(t, ·) −Uk ∈X, (5.15)-
(5.16) are written in C as
˙u(t) = rD2u(t) + Lr(ut) + f(ut, r),
(t ≥0)
(5.18)
where for k > 1 ﬁxed we denote
Lr(ϕ) = rk[(1−Uk)ϕ(0)−Ukϕ(−1)],
f(ϕ, r) = −rkϕ(0)ϕ(−1),
ϕ ∈C.
The linearized equation around the equilibrium Uk is given by
˙u(t) = rD2u(t) + Lr(ut),
(5.19)
whose solution operator has inﬁnitesimal generator Ar deﬁned by
Arφ = ˙φ,
D(Ar) = {φ ∈C1([−r, 0]; X) : φ(0) ∈H2
0, ˙φ(0) = r[D2 + k(1 −Uk)]φ(0) −rkUkφ(−r)}.
271

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Due to the time-scaling, the characteristic equation for (5.19) becomes
∆(k, λ, r)y = 0,
y ∈H2
0 \ {0}
∆(k, λ, r) = r[D2 + k(1 −Uk) −ke−λUk] −λ.
(5.20)
We now describe brieﬂy the framework for the application of the
n.f. method. One must compute the n.f. for the 2-dimensional ODE
giving the ﬂow on the centre manifold for (5.18) at the bifurcating points
r = rkn, n ∈N0.
Let k > 1 and n ∈N0 be ﬁxed. For r = rkn, set Λ = Λk,n as the set
of eigenvalues on the imaginary axis,
Λ = {iλkn, −iλkn},
and decompose C = P ⊕Q and BC = P ⊕Ker π by Λ via the formal
adjoint theory in Section 5.1. Consider the scaling r = rkn + α, and
write (5.18) as
˙u(t) = rknD2u(t) + Lrknut + F(ut, α),
(5.21)

Normal Forms And Bifurcations For DDE
The application of the n.f. method to (5.22) leads to the following
result:
Theorem 5.9. [42] Let k, n be ﬁxed, with k ∈(1, k∗) and n ∈N0. The
n.f. up to cubic terms for the ﬂow on the centre manifold of the origin
near α = 0 is given in polar coordinates (ρ, ξ) by

Note that the coeﬃcients K1 = K1(k, n) and K2 = K2(k, n) depend
on k, n and are given in terms of the coeﬃcients of the original equation.
The ﬁrst equation of the system for both h20, h11 is a linear ODE that can
be easily solved. However, the second equation requires the resolution of
273

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
a PDE with non-constant coeﬃcients and Dirichlet boundary conditions
on [0, π]. Since the solutions cannot be explicitly computed, the signs
of the meaningful constants K1 and K2 have to determined by indirect
methods. This requires hard computations, whose conclusions we give
in the next theorem. Note that these results hold for k > 1 close to 1.
An interesting question is whether the results persist for large k > 1.
Theorem 5.10. [42] Fix k ∈(1, k∗) and n ∈N0. Then for 0 < k −
1 << 1, K1(k, n) > 0 and K2(k, n) < 0. Therefore a supercritical Hopf
bifurcations occurs at r = rkn, with stable non-trivial periodic solutions
on the centre manifold.

Introduction
This section is intended to motivate the interest in abstract diﬀer-
ential delay equations (DDE) by means of examples. When thinking
about extending functional diﬀerential equations from ﬁnite to inﬁnite
dimensions, one of the ﬁrst and main examples which comes to mind is
the case of evolution equations combining diﬀusion and delayed reaction.
This is the situation in the ﬁrst example that we are going to present,
which is a model proposed by A. Calsina and O. El Idrissi ([11]), which
joins spatial diﬀusion with demographic reaction.
But it is not the only situation one can think of: we also present
a second example which arises from a model of cell proliferation ﬁrst
introduced by M. Kimmel et al. in [24]. Several modiﬁed versions of
this model were proposed and studied later.
In most treatments, it
is viewed as an integro-diﬀerence equation and solved using a step-by-
step procedure ([2], [3], [36]). While this technique oﬀers the advantage
of allowing explicit integration in terms of the initial function, it has
also some deﬁciencies specially when looking at nonlinear perturbations

and dynamical features, which are better studied in the framework of
diﬀerential equations than in the one of integral equations.

A model of ﬁsh population dynamics with
spatial diﬀusion ([11])
Let us consider a ﬁsh population divided into two stages, young and
adults, distributed within the water column, which is represented by an
interval of the real line. A crucial assumption is that only the young-
sters may move in the water column randomly, their movement being
described by a diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The adults are structured by the
position they had when turning adult.
We introduce the following variables: t ∈R is the chronological time,
a ∈[0, l] is the age, where l < +∞is the age of maturity, and z ∈[0, z∗]
is the position in the water column, where z∗is the depth, oriented
positively from the water surface to the bottom. Then, the model is
formulated in terms of the following state variables:
i) u(a, t, z) is the density of young ﬁsh of age a, at depth z, at time
t.
ii) v(t, z) is the density of the adult population at depth z at time t.
iii) r(t) is the maximum available resource at time t.

In the above system:
The function k(z) represents the mixing coeﬃcient due to water
turbulence. It is continuous, positive on [0, z∗) and k(z∗) = 0.
The functions mi(r) are mortality rates for the young ﬁsh (i = 1)
and the adults (i = 2). They are smooth and decreasing with a
positive inﬁmum.
286

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
The function b = b(z, ξ) is the fertility rate of the adults combined
with a mixing process of the newborns throughout the water col-
umn: it can be for example that, for some physiological reason,
the eggs produced at any level have a density lower than the water
and go to the surface as a result of Archimedes law.
The function g(r) is smooth and decreasing and changes signs at
some critical value rc. It may be interpreted as the logistic which
would govern the dynamics of the resource in the absence of con-
sumption by ﬁsh.
L is a positive linear functional which gives the total potential pres-
sure of the ﬁsh on the resource, while the function h is a bounded
smooth and increasing function, with h(0) = 0, which models a
limiting eﬀect on resource accessibility caused by overcrowding.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Looking at the right hand side of the two equations in system (1.2), we
can see that each of them is made up of a combination of expressions
involving the values of the unknown functions v or r either at time t or
at some earlier time: the integral in the exponential term is expressed in
terms of the values of r over the interval [t−l, t] while the other integral
uses v(t −l, ζ). Under some reasonable assumptions on the coeﬃcients,
these quantities are smooth functions of v(t, .) or v(t −., .) and r(t −.).
It is in fact a delay diﬀerential equation deﬁned on a space of functions.
The diﬀerence with the initial formulation is that system (1.1) involves
partial derivatives with respect to z and so requires additional regularity
on the functions v and r to make sense.
Notice that (1.1) has been formulated from t = 0 while (1.2) only
holds for t > l. This means that if we were to solve the equation with
initial value given at t = 0, we could not do it using system (1.2). We
would have to use (1.1) to build up the solution on the interval [0, l] and
we would then be able to solve the equation for t > l by using (1.2).
On the other hand, we can always solve (1.2) directly, choosing a pair
of functions v0, r0 arbitrarily. Of course, in most cases, what we will
obtain is not a solution of (1.1). Only some of the solutions of (1.2) are
also solutions of (1.1).
So what is the point of looking at (1.2) when the problem to be solved
is (1.1)? There are at least two reasons: ﬁrst of all, the Cauchy problem
associated with system (1.2) is much simpler than the one for (1.1). It
is a system of delay diﬀerential equations: even if it is formulated in a
space of inﬁnite dimensions, it does not involve an unbounded opera-
tor and can be solved, at least theoretically, by setting up a ﬁxed point
problem which can be shown to be a strict contraction for time small
enough. The second and main reason is that real systems are normally
expected to converge asymptotically towards their attractor where the
transients entailed by a particular initial condition vanish: in this re-
spect, systems (1.1) and (1.2) are indistinguishable, while the study of
qualitative properties of (1.2) is, at least conceptually, easier than that
of a system of partial diﬀerential equations.
1.2
An abstract diﬀerential equation arising
from cell population dynamics
In the model elaborated by M. Kimmel et al. and reported in [24],
cells are classiﬁed according to some constituent which, after division
(by mitosis) is divided in some stochastic way between the two daughter
cells. The model considers the cells only at two distinct stages:
288

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
a) At mitosis, the number of cells going through mitosis (that is, the
mother cells), in some time interval [t1, t2], with a size in some
size interval [x1, x2], is determined in terms of a density function
m(t, x):
 t2
t1
 x2
x1
m(t, x) dtdx.
b) At the beginning of the cycle, just after division, the number of
cells born during the time interval [t1, t2], with a size in some size
interval [x1, x2] is determined in terms of a density function n(t, x):
 t2
t1
 x2
x1
n(t, x) dtdx.
The distribution of sizes from mother to daughter is modelled by a con-
ditional probability density, a function f(x, y) such that:
 x2
x1
f(x, y) dx
=
probability for a daughter cell born from a mother cell
of size y to have size between x1 and x2.
Other conditions on f include a support property: it is assumed that
there exist d1, d2, 0 < d1 < 1/2 < d2 < 1, such that
f(x, y) > 0 if and only if d1y < x < d2y.
The model is completed by two functions describing respectively:
1) The duration of a cycle in terms of the initial size
T = Ψ(x),
where Ψ is positive, decreasing, Ψ(+∞) > 0, continuously diﬀer-
entiable and such that infa≤x≤b |Ψ′(x)| > 0 on each interval [a, b],
0 < a ≤b < +∞.
2) The size at division in terms of the initial size
y = Φ(x),
where Φ is increasing, Φ(x) > x for x > 0, Φ is continuously
diﬀerentiable and such that infa≤x≤b Φ′(x) > 0 on each interval
[a, b], 0 < a ≤b < +∞.
289

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
From these basic assumptions, one can derive two fundamental equa-
tions relating the state functions n and m (see [24]). Eliminating m from
the two equations leads to
n(t, x) = 2
 +∞
0
f (x, Φ(y)) n (t −Ψ(y), y) dy.
(1.3)
The assumption on the support of f induces a support property for n;
that is, if we assume that n(s, x) = 0 for all x outside an interval [A1, A2],
0 < A1 ≤A2 < +∞, and s < t, then equation (1.3) yields:
n(t, x) = 0 for x < d1Φ(A1) or x > d2Φ(A2).
Assuming that
d1Φ′(0) > 1 and d2 lim sup
x→+∞
Φ(x)
x
< 1,
we deduce from the above remark that for any A1 > 0 small enough,
and A2 < +∞, large enough, the size interval [A1, A2] is invariant, that
is, all generations of cells born from cells with initial size in [A1, A2] will
have size at birth in the same interval. Note that for such cells the cell
cycle length is bounded above by the number
r = Ψ(A1).
(1.4)
Assuming all the above conditions hold, choosing A1, A2 as we just said,
r being given by formula (1.4), it was proved in [24] that equation (1.3)
yields a positive semigroup in the space
E = L1 ((−r, 0) × (A1, A2)) ,
that is, the one parameter family of maps which to any initial function
p ∈E associates the function denoted nt, t ≥0:
nt(θ, x) := n(t + θ, x) ,
−r ≤θ < 0 ,
x ∈(A1, A2),
with n0 = p, where n veriﬁes equation (1.3)) for all t ≥0, determines a
strongly continuous semigroup of positive operators on E ([84]) which,
moreover, are compact for t large enough.
As a brief comment on the original proof of this result, let us point
out that the right-hand side of (1.3) is explicitly determined in terms
of the initial function p, for all 0 < t < Ψ(A2). So, the solution can
be computed on the set (0, Ψ(A2)) × (A1, A2) by a straight integration
of the initial function. Then, taking nψ(A2) as a new initial function,
290

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
the solution can be computed on (Ψ(A2), 2Ψ(A2)) × (A1, A2); then, by
induction, it can be computed on each set (kΨ(A2), (k + 1)Ψ(A2)) ×
(A1, A2) for each k ≥1.
Note that the principle of integration of such equations is the same
as in the case of diﬀerence equations. Thus, computing the solutions is
almost a trivial task, the only not completely obvious thing being that
the function deﬁned by putting end to end the pieces corresponding to
each set (kΨ(A2), (k + 1)Ψ(A2))×(A1, A2) veriﬁes equation (1.3) for all
t > 0.
In [3], [4], [5], nonlinear extensions of equation (1.3) were introduced.
We will mention only one such model ([5]):
n(t, x) = 2λσ (N(t −τ))
 +∞
0
f (x, Φ(y)) n (t −Ψ(y), y) dy,
(1.5)
where
N(t) =

- t

.
dx,
(1.6)
N(t) represents the number of cells present at time t. The expression
λσ (N(t −τ)) models a control mechanism which can be interpreted as a
rate of defective division. This rate is shaped by the function σ, assumed
to be C1, and decreasing, 0 < σ(x) < 1; λ is a coeﬃcient of magnitude
0 < λ < 1. As λ increases from 0 to 1, σ being unchanged, stability
properties of equilibria of equation (1.5) may change. In [3], the case
τ = 0 was studied. It was proved that for λ less than some value, the
solutions converge to zero, while, above this value, zero loses its stability
and a new global equilibrium arises. In the case τ > 0, the problem is
far more complicated. In [5] some global results regarding the existence
of slowly oscillating periodic solutions were obtained, in very restricted
situations.
A reasonable conjecture is that these large oscillations are preceded
by small periodic oscillations taking place in the vicinity of the nontrivial
equilibrium, due to a local Hopf bifurcation.
One of the main motivations of our eﬀort in the direction of abstract
delay equations lies in the fact that we aimed at investigating the above
conjecture. For this purpose, the diﬀerence equation approach is not
well-suited.

1.3
From integro-diﬀerence to abstract delay
diﬀerential equations ([8])
1.3.1
The linear equation.
We will now derive two diﬀer-
ential equations from equation (1.3). The ﬁrst one leads to a partial
diﬀerential equation with retarded arguments, a retarded version of the
Lotka-Volterra equation of demography ([42]). The theory underlying
such an equation is the theory of abstract delay diﬀerential equations
with unbounded operators. Although it is probably the best framework
in the sense that it leads to the same semigroup as equation (1.3), it
involves a theory that is not available yet. The second one is a diﬀer-
ential equation with retarded arguments and a bounded operator. It
ﬁts into the framework within which the extension of the theory of de-
lay diﬀerential equations will be developed later ([58], [7]). The main
shortcoming of the second equation is that it leads to a dynamical sys-
tem much bigger than the one under study, one in which the solutions
of interest determine a proper subset. However, some of the dynamical
properties of the larger system also hold for the smaller one, for example,
stability and bifurcation of equilibria in the larger system reﬂect similar
properties for the smaller one. This fact amply justiﬁes in our view the
study of this system which, on the other hand, is much simpler than the
smaller one.
Retarded partial diﬀerential equation formulation of equa-
tion (1.3).– Consider a solution n of equation (1.3). Assume that n can
be diﬀerentiated with respect to time and size. We will use the notations
∂1n (resp. ∂2n) to denote the function obtained by taking the partial
derivative of n with respect to its ﬁrst variable (resp. the second one).
The computations we will perform are mostly formal. They could be
justiﬁed afterwards.
Taking the derivative with respect to t on both sides of equation (1.3),
we arrive at

from which we deduce the following expression for ∂1n:

f (x, Φ(y)) [n (t −Ψ(y), y) −n (−Ψ(y), y)] dy.

A very partial converse result in this respect is the following: if n is a

Assume that n(t, ·) is deﬁned on R (for example, n is a periodic solution
of (1.5)). In this case, n satisﬁes equation (1.14). Assuming f bounded
on bounded rectangles, we conclude that n is bounded and continuous
on each set [−T, T] × R+, (T > 0), which in particular implies that N
is locally Lipschitz continuous. Assuming moreover that f is C1, it is
possible to write the integral in equation (1.14) in the following way:

which implies that n is locally Lipschitz in t, uniformly in x, in other
words, there exists N, a negligible set of t-values, such that n(t, x) is
diﬀerentiable for all t not in N, and all x ∈(A1, A2). In conclusion, we
have the following
Lemma 32 If n is a solution of ( 1.5), deﬁned for every t in R, then n
is diﬀerentiable in t with ∂n/∂t continuous in R×R, satisfying equation
( 1.17).
Equation (1.17) is a nonlinear delay diﬀerential equation on the space
L1(A1, A2), with maximum delay equal to 2r + τ. As in the linear case,
it is obvious, by construction, that the solutions of the system (1.5)-(1.6)
are solutions of equation (1.17), but equation (1.17) has a much bigger
set of solutions than system (1.5)-(1.6). The motivation for embedding
the latter system into a bigger one is that the framework of diﬀerential
equations seems to be more suited to the study of dynamical features
such as stability than the framework of integral equations.
1.4
The linearized equation of equation (1.17)
near nontrivial steady-states
Equation (1.17) is the most complete of all the equations considered
here. It can be reduced to equation (1.11) by assuming that 2λσ(N) =
1.
If the delay τ = 0, we obtain the equation studied in [3].
Our
program regarding equation (1.17) is to start from the steady-states and
investigate their stability and the loss of stability in terms of λ. While
we already know from [3] that stability passes from a constant steady-
state to another one when τ = 0, we expect that in the delay case stable
oscillations may take place.
This fact has been shown under several
restrictions in [5]: existence of periodic slowly oscillating solutions has
been demonstrated for a range of values of the parameters. However, the
result is not explicitly related to any bifurcation of steady-state periodic
solution. We believe however that there is a strong possibility that such
a bifurcation occurs at these values of λ where some eigenvalues of the
linearized equation cross the imaginary axis (away from zero).

Exponential solutions of (1.20) .
The study of the
stability of n as a solution of equation (1.17) amounts to the study of
the growth rate of the semigroup associated to equation (1.20). In the
case of a compact or eventually compact semigroup, this amounts to
determining exponential solutions (exp zt)x. Then, the growth rate is
negative if sup Re z < 0, and it is positive if sup Re z > 0. Bifurcation
of equilibria occurs at the values of parameters where the growth rate
changes signs. It can be shown that the semigroup associated to equation
(1.20) is not eventually compact, but its restriction to the elements of

To abbreviate, we will call such an equation a spectral equation. Note
that the right-hand side of the above equation vanishes for z = 0. For
this value of z, every function p satisﬁes the equation. Equation (1.21)
is quite complicated.
We will not study it directly.
Instead, we will
now introduce the eigenvalue equation associated with the linearization
of equation (1.5). Then, we will show that both equations are partially
equivalent to each other.
Ideally, one could expect that this part of the spectrum is the part
brought up by the passage from the integral to the diﬀerential formu-
lation, and the remaining part of the spectrum reﬂects the spectrum
of the integral equation only. The spectral equation associated to the
linearization of equation (1.5) near n is

converse of this result.
Lemma 33 Denote σ1 (resp. σ2 ) the set of complex numbers z, z ̸= 0,
Re z ≥0, such that equation ( 1.21) (resp.)
( 1.22) ) has a nonzero
solution for the value z. Then, σ1 = σ2.

Moreover, for each z ∈σi, let N iz ( i = 1, 2) be the space of functions
p such that p is a solution of ( 1.21) (resp. ( 1.22) ) for the value z.
Then, N 1z = N 2z.
Proof.– For each z ̸= 0, we introduce the operators

dy,

Then equation (1.22) is
p(x) = e−zτn(x)Bz(p) + (Lzp) (x),
and equation (1.21) reads
p(x) = e−zτn(x)Bz(p) + (Lzq) (x),
where
q(x) = e−zτn(x)Bz(p) + (Lzp) (x).
We need only prove that p, a solution of (1.21) for some z ̸= 0, with
Re z ≥0, satisﬁes (1.22) for the same value of z. But this is equivalent
to proving p = q. Since we have
p(x) −q(x) = (Lz(p −q)) (x),
and the equation
p(x) = (Lzp) (x)
can be satisﬁed with p ̸= 0 only if Re z < 0, the Lemma follows.
We will now brieﬂy discuss equation (1.22).
For z = 0, equation (1.22) reduces to

which implies that

f (x, Φ(y)) e−zΨ(y)p(y) dy,
which can be satisﬁed with p ̸= 0 only if Re z < 0.
So, instability from nonzero roots crossing the imaginary axis can only
come from roots of equation (1.26). We have the following result:
For each λ > 0, equation (1.24) has a pair of nonzero roots crossing
the imaginary axis at each value τ = τk, where

1.5
Conclusion
The construction of a theory of delay diﬀerential equations in inﬁnite
dimensional spaces is motivated by the study of some integro-diﬀerence
equations arising in some models of cell population dynamics. The in-
troduction of a nonlinearity in these models to account for possible self-
regulating control mechanism of cell number suggested possible oscilla-
tions. The integro-diﬀerence nature of the model did not allow the use
of any known standard techniques to exhibit such oscillations.The ob-
servation that was made that this system (and its solutions) can in fact
be viewed as solutions of a larger system of delay diﬀerential equations
in an inﬁnite dimensional space led to the idea to extend this frame the
machinery for the study of stability that has been developed for delay
diﬀerential equations in ﬁnite dimensional spaces.
Let us conclude with a few comments about oscillations. Oscillation
with respect to time of the number of cells is a recognized fact in several
examples, among which is the production of red blood cells ([4], [17]).
This phenomenon can also be observed in cultured cells. It used to be a
common belief that such oscillations reﬂect the role of delays at various
stages of the life of cells. A lot of eﬀorts were made during the seventies
in the study of homogeneous nonstructured models with the goals of
ﬁrst proving existence of periodic oscillations, after that counting them
and looking at their stability and other properties. Amongst those who
contributed to these works let us mention [12], [22] and [41]. In contrast
to this, very little has been done in the case of structured models. One of
the reasons is that there is no general theory for the study of dynamical
properties of such equations. The theory on abstract D.D.E. that we
present here is a step in this direction.

The Cauchy Problem For An Abstract Linear
Delay Diﬀerential Equation
Our interest in functional diﬀerential equations in inﬁnite dimensions
stemmed from the study of the dynamical properties of such equations
303

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
and the remark we made at some point that it is possible to associate
to any of them a delay diﬀerential equation on an inﬁnite dimensional
vector space. We start with this theory for the linear and autonomous
case and this section is devoted to the resolution of the Cauchy problem.
We start setting up the general framework of the equations under
study. The notation C stands for the space C([−r, 0]; E) (r > 0) of the
continuous functions from the interval [−r, 0] into E, E being a real
Banach space, endowed with the sup norm
∥ϕ∥C :=
sup
θ∈[−r,0]
∥ϕ(θ)∥E.
Let L : C −→E be a bounded linear operator. We are considering the
following Cauchy problem for the delay equation deﬁned by the operator
L:
For each ϕ ∈C, to ﬁnd a function x ∈C([−r, +∞[; E), x ∈C1([0, +
∞[; E) such that the following relations hold
(CP)

x′(t)
=
L(xt) , for all t > 0
x0
=
ϕ
As usual, xt denotes the section at t of the function x, namely xt(θ) :=
x(t + θ), θ ∈[−r, 0]. The Cauchy problem is well-posed if it has one and
only one solution for each initial value ϕ.
2.1
Resolution of the Cauchy problem
There are several ways to solve problem (CP). The most elementary
one is to write the equation in integral form
x(t) = x(0) +

t ≥0.

which can be formulated as an abstract equation in a suitable framework.
To this end, for each α > 0 let us deﬁne
Eα
0 := {y ∈C([0, +∞); E) ; y(0) = 0 , ∥y∥α := sup
t≥0
e−αt∥y(t)∥E < +∞}
which is a Banach space with respect to the norm ∥· ∥α.
Let Q be the bounded linear operator deﬁned by
Q : E0

;
(Qy)(t) :=
 t

L(˜ys) ds
where ˜y is the extension by zero of function y to [−r, 0]. In terms of this
operator, equation (2.2) reads as:
(Id −Q)(y)(t) =
 t
0
L(ϕ0
s) ds.
The norm of Q on Eα
0 satisﬁes the following estimate
∥Qy∥α ≤∥L∥
α ∥y∥α
so, for α > ∥L∥, Q is a strict contraction. This implies that equation
(2.1) has one and only one solution deﬁned on [−r, +∞[. This proves
that the Cauchy problem (CP) is well-posed.
As usual, bearing in mind that the initial state is the function ϕ and
the state at time t is the function xt, we introduce the solution operator
T(t) deﬁned by
T(t)ϕ := xt
,
t > 0.
It is easy to check that the family {T(t)}t≥0 is a strongly continuous
semigroup of linear bounded operators on C. An obvious property of
this semigroup is that
[T(t)ϕ] (θ) =
3
ϕ(t + θ)
if
t + θ ≤0
[T(t + θ)ϕ] (0)
if
t + θ ≥0
that is, {T(t)}t≥0 is a translation semigroup.
Straightforward computation leads to the following operator as the
inﬁnitesimal generator of the semigroup:
Aϕ := ˙ϕ
(2.3)
with domain
D(A) = {ϕ ∈C1([−r, 0]; E) ; ˙ϕ(0) = L(ϕ)}.

Semigroup approach to the problem (CP)
Semigroups deﬁned on some functional space of the type F(J; E),
where J is an interval and F is some class of functions (continuous
functions, Lp functions, etc) and with inﬁnitesimal generator A deﬁned
by the derivative on J, have been investigated by several authors after
a pioneering work by A. Plant [34].
Extension of Plant’s results to
abstract delay diﬀerential equations can be found in [16] and in [73].
The following result is borrowed from [73].
Theorem 1 The operator A deﬁned by ( 2.3) with domain given by
( 2.4) is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup
{S(t)}t≥0 on C satisfying the translation property
(S(t)ϕ)(θ) =
3
ϕ(t + θ)
if
t + θ ≤0
(S(t + θ)ϕ)(0)
if
t + θ > 0
t > 0, θ ∈[−r, 0], ϕ ∈C. Furthermore, for each ϕ ∈C, deﬁne x :
[−r, +∞) −→E by
x(t) :=
3
ϕ(t)
if
t ∈[−r, 0]
(S(t)ϕ)(0)
if
t > 0.
Then x is the unique solution of (CP) and S(t)ϕ = xt, t > 0.
Remark 1.– The last part of the theorem states that in fact S(t) =
T(t), t ≥0, which we can assert as soon as we know that {S(t)}t≥0 and
{T(t)}t≥0 are both associated with the same inﬁnitesimal generator.
Proof.– In order to illustrate the type of computations and ideas in-
volved in delay equations, we will brieﬂy sketch the proof of the theorem.
First of all, we will check that A is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a
strongly continuous semigroup. Using the Lumer-Phillips version of the
Hille-Yosida theorem, we have to prove that:
i) A is a closed operator with a dense domain.
ii) The resolvent operator
R(λ, A) := (λI −A)−1
exists, for all real λ large enough and there exists a real constant
ω such that
∥(λI −A)−1∥≤

Lemma 34 For each λ ∈C, the operator Sλ is onto.
Proof.–
Let us consider the family of bounded linear operators {Σλ,k}k=1,2,... ⊂L(E)
deﬁned by
Σλ,k(z) := Sλ (χk ⊗z)
where
(χk ⊗z)(θ) := χk(θ)z

and {χk}k=1,2,... is the family of real functions deﬁned by

θ ∈[−r, 0].
It is easily seen that for each λ, the sequence of operators Σλ,k converges
in operator norm towards the identity. Therefore Σλ,k is invertible for k
large enough.

In terms of Σλ,k, we can build a right inverse of Sλ. To this end, let
us deﬁne Υλ,k ∈L(E, C) by

Υλ,k(b) := χk ⊗Σ−1
λ,k(b).
(2.9)
It holds that
Sλ ◦Υλ,k = IE
where IE is the identity operator on E. This proves our claim.
In terms of operators Lλ and Sλ, we have the following characteriza-
tion for λ to belong in the resolvent set of the operator A:
Proposition 37 A necessary and suﬃcient condition for λ ∈ρ(A) (re-
solvent set of A) is that the operator ∆(λ) deﬁned by

to obtain a convenient estimate for the norm of R(λ, A).
Straightforward computation shows that the operator Lλ is uniformly
bounded on each right half-plane of C (that is, on any set of the type
Ωa := {z ∈C ; Re z ≥a} for some a). So, there exists a0 ∈R such that
∆(λ) is invertible all over regions of the complex plane Ωa with a ≥a0.
Let us deﬁne
M :=
sup
Re λ≥a0
∥Lλ∥.
For any a ≥a0, we have
Re λ ≥a =⇒∥Lλ∥≤M.
So, if we take a > 0 and a ≥a0 large enough, we will have
λ ≥a =⇒∥Lλ∥
λ
< 1
and then
∥∆(λ)−1∥≤
1
λ −M .

We can also readily check the following estimate for Sλ(f)
∥Sλ(f)∥≤

∥f∥C.
Combining these estimates in formula (2.10) we obtain, for θ ∈[−r, 0]:

Since the quantity inside brackets is a convex combination of two ﬁxed

for
λ > ω.
Translation semigroup property.– It remains to check that the
semigroup {S(t)}t≥0 enjoys the translation property. To this end, for
each ϕ given in C, let us deﬁne the function
x(t) =
3
[S(t)ϕ] (0)
if
t ≥0
ϕ(t)
if
t ∈[−r, 0]
What we have to verify is that
S(t)ϕ = xt
,
t ≥0.
Note that the evaluation map ϕ →[S(t)ϕ] (0) is continuous and even
locally uniformly continuous with respect to t, so the map ϕ →xt is
continuous for each t ≥0, and in fact it is also locally uniformly contin-
uous with respect to t. From this remark it follows that we only have to
prove the property on a dense subset of initial values. It will extend by
continuity to all initial values.
So, from this point on, we assume that ϕ ∈D(A). Then, a basic
semigroup property ensures that S(t)ϕ ∈D(A) for all t ≥0. Therefore
309

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
we have that both t →[S(t)ϕ] (θ) and θ →[S(t)ϕ] (θ) are diﬀerentiable.
Given a pair (t, θ), t ≥0, θ ∈[−r, 0], the function
h →[S(t + h)ϕ] (θ −h)
makes sense as long as t + h ≥0 and θ −h ≤0, that is, h ≥max(−t, θ)
and can be diﬀerentiated on this domain. The derivative is equal to
 d
dtS(t + h)ϕ

(θ −h) −d
dθ [S(t + h)ϕ] (θ −h) = 0.
This implies that [S(t + h)ϕ] (θ −h) is a constant for each ﬁxed pair
(t, θ) and h ≥max(−t, θ).
We now consider two situations:
i) t + θ ≤0.
In this case, max(−t, θ) = −t. Giving h the values −t and 0, we
obtain
[S(t)ϕ] (θ) = ϕ(t + θ)
for
t + θ ≤0.
ii) t + θ ≥0.
This time, we give h the values θ and 0, which leads to
[S(t)ϕ] (θ) = [S(t + θ)ϕ] (0)
for
t + θ ≥0.
In both cases, we have [S(t)ϕ] (θ) = x(t + θ), according to the deﬁnition
of x, therefore, S(t)ϕ = xt, as desired.
2.3
Some results about the range of λI −A
In line with Proposition 37, we have the following results.
Lemma 35 For any λ ∈C, we have that f ∈R (λI −A) if and only if
Sλ(f) ∈R (λI −Lλ).
Proof.– It follows immediately from (2.6) and (2.7) combined. For-
mula (2.6) shows that the determination of ϕ such that (λI −A)ϕ = f
amounts to determining ϕ(0) and formula (2.7) gives a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for existence of ϕ(0) which is precisely the condition
stated in the lemma.
Lemma 36 The subspace R (λI −A) is closed in C if and only if the
subspace R (λI −Lλ) is closed in E.
Proof.– First we suppose that R (λI −Lλ) is a closed subspace of
E and let {ψn}n=1,2,... ⊂R (λI −A) be a convergent sequence with
ψ = limn→∞ψn.
310

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
From Lemma 35, we have that Sλ(ψn) ∈R (λI−Lλ) and then Sλ(ψ) ∈
R (λI−Lλ). Again Lemma 35 enables us to conclude that ψ ∈R (λI−A)
and so R(λI −A) is closed in C.
Now we are going to demonstrate the converse.
We assume that
R (λI−A) is closed and we want to show that it implies that R (λI−Lλ)
is closed.
To this end, we recall that Sλ is surjective and that in Lemma 34 we
have exhibited a family of right inverses. Select one such map Υλ,k as
deﬁned by (2.9).
Let {bn}n=1,2,... be a sequence in E such that the sequence {(λI −
Lλ)(bn)}n=1,2,... converges to some element e ∈E. Deﬁne the sequence
fn := Υλ,k [(λI −Lλ)(bn)]
,
n = 1, 2, . . .
By construction, we have Sλ(fn) ∈R (λI −Lλ). Therefore, in view of
Lemma 35, we have fn ∈R (λI −A) and Sλ(fn) = (λI −Lλ)(bn). We
have also
lim
n→∞Sλ(fn) = e
;
lim
n→∞fn = Υλ,k(e).
R (λI −A) being closed yields that Υλ,k(e) ∈R (λI −A). Lemma 35
again can be invoked to conclude that e = Sλ [Υλ,k(e)] ∈R(λI −Lλ).
The proof is complete.
3.
Formal Duality
In this section we present an extension of the formal duality theory
to D.D.E. in inﬁnite dimensional spaces. The presentation follows the
work made in [58].
Let us consider the space C∗:= C([0, r]; E∗) where E∗is the topolog-
ical dual space of E. We are going to deﬁne a continuous bilinear form
denoted << α, ϕ >> on the product C([0, r]; E∗) × C([−r, 0]; E) which
will be interpreted as a formal duality.
A function f : [0, r] −→E∗is called simple if there exist two ﬁnite
collections x∗

where χA is the characteristic function of A and Σ is the Borel algebra
on [0, r]. Denote S([0, r]; E∗) the space of simple functions.

Deﬁnition 37 For any α ∈S([0, r]; E∗) and ϕ ∈C([0, r]; E) we deﬁne

The value << α, ϕ >> is independent of the representation chosen for
α as a linear combination of characteristic functions.
Since
| << α, ϕ >> | ≤(1 + r∥L∥) ∥α∥∥ϕ∥
there exists a unique continuous extension of this bilinear form to the
completion of S([0, r]; E∗)×C([−r, 0]; E) where both spaces are equipped
with the sup norm.
We restrict our extension to the product C([0, r] : E∗) × C([−r, 0]; E)
and we call this the formal duality associated with the operator L.
It is interesting to specify the formal duality for α ∈C([0, r]) ⊗E∗.
Lemma 37 Let f ∈C([0, r]) and u∗∈E∗. We consider the function
f ⊗u∗∈C([0, r]; E∗) deﬁned by (f ⊗u∗) (s) := f(s)u∗, s ∈[0, r]. Then
<< f ⊗u∗, ϕ >>=< u∗, f(0)ϕ(0) > + < u∗, L

n=1,2,...
converges to f ⊗u∗.
312

3.1
The formal adjoint equation
Before proceeding to the construction of this equation let us remind
some well known results about the integral representation of bounded
linear operators deﬁned on C([−r, 0]; E). We refer to [14] for the general
theory.
Any bounded linear operator L : C([−r, 0]; E) −→E determines a
unique vector measure m : ˆΣ −→L(E; E∗∗) of bounded semivariation
and such that for all f ∈C([−r, 0]; E) we have
L(f) =

[−r,0]
fd m
where L(E; E∗∗) is the space of the bounded linear operators deﬁned
on E with values in E∗∗, E∗∗being the bidual of E, and ˆΣ the Borel
algebra on [−r, 0].
For each x∗∈E∗, there exists a vector measure mx∗: ˆΣ −→E∗
deﬁned by
< mx∗(A), x >:=< x∗, m(A)(x) >
;
A ∈ˆΣ , x ∈E
which satisﬁes

[−r,0]
fd mx∗=< x∗, L(f) >
;
∀x∗∈E∗.

Next we deﬁne the linear operator ˜L : S([0, r]; E∗) −→E∗for any f ∈
S([0, r]; E∗), f = p
i=1 x∗
i χAi by
˜L(f) :=
p

i=1

i (−Ai).
Lemma 38 If the vector measure m is of bounded variation, then ˜L is
continuous with respect to the sup norm in S([0, r]; E∗).
Proof.– Let f = p
i=1 x∗
i χAi be a simple function with ∥x∗
i ∥≤1,
i = 1, . . . , p. Then
∥˜L(f)∥
=

∥m(−Ai)∥≤v(m) ([−r, 0]) < +∞
where v(m) means the variation of m and we have used that

∥x∥≤1
| < mx∗
i (−Ai), x > |

sup
∥x∥≤1

Under this hypothesis, there exists a unique continuous extension ˜˜L
of the operator ˜L to the completion of S([0, r]; E∗) equipped with the
sup norm and we are able to deﬁne the formal adjoint operator of the
operator L.
Deﬁnition 38 The operator L∗is the restriction to the space C∗of the
extension operator ˜˜L.
Just as we did in the case of the formal duality, it is convenient to ob-
tain the expression of L∗for the elements in C([0, r])⊗E∗. Calculations
very similar to the ones above for Lemma 37 show that
Lemma 39 For each f ⊗u∗∈C([0, r]) ⊗E∗, L∗(f ⊗u∗) ∈E∗is the
linear form deﬁned by
< L∗(f ⊗u∗), u >:=< u∗, L( ˆf ⊗u) >
;
u ∈E
(3.3)
where ˆf(θ) := f(−θ).
314

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
For each f ∈C([−r, 0]), u ∈E, we have denoted by f ⊗u the element
of C([−r, 0]; E) deﬁned by
(f ⊗u)(θ) := f(θ)u
,
θ ∈[−r, 0].
In particular, for the functions ε(j)
λ
deﬁned by
ε(j)
λ (θ) := θj
j! eλθ
;
θ ∈[−r, 0] , j = 1, 2, . . .
(3.4)
we reach the result
< L∗(ˆε(j)
λ ⊗u∗), u >
=
< u∗, L(ε(j)
λ ⊗u) >
:=
< u∗, L(j)
λ (u) >=< (L(j)
λ )∗(u∗), u >
;
u ∈E
and then
L∗(ˆε(j)
λ ⊗u∗) = (L(j)
λ )∗(u∗).
The existence of the operator L∗allows us to deﬁne a new linear
functional diﬀerential equation associated with problem (CP).
Deﬁnition 39 The formal adjoint equation associated to (CP) is
˙α(s) = −L∗(αs)
;
s ≤0.
(3.5)
A function α ∈C(] −∞, r]; E∗) is a solution to the formal adjoint
equation if α ∈C1(] −∞, 0]; E∗) and satisﬁes (3.5) for all s ≤0.
It is easy to check that α(s) := e−λs ⊗x∗, s ≤0 is a solution of (3.5)
for all x∗∈N (L∗
λ −λI). Suppose that α(t) := f(t)x∗is a solution of
(3.5) on ] −∞, b] and that x(t) is a solution of (CP) on [a, +∞[, a < b.
Then << αt, xt >> is constant for all t ∈[a, b].
Indeed
<< αt, xt >>

But since

315

< α′(t), x(t) > + < L∗(αt), x(t) >= 0.
3.2
The operator A∗formal adjoint of A
In the sequel we assume that the vector measure m associated to L is
of bounded variation and L∗has been deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 40 We call the formal adjoint operator of A relative to the
formal duality, the operator A∗deﬁned by
A∗(α) := −˙α
with domain
D(A∗) := {α ∈C1([0, r]; E∗) ; ˙α(0) = −L∗(α)}.
A∗is linear and closed, with a dense domain contained in C∗.
From Lemma 37 and after an adequate integration by parts we obtain
for α := f ⊗x∗∈D(A∗):
<< α, Aϕ >>=<< A∗α, ϕ >>
;
∀ϕ ∈D(A).
Proposition 38 The spectra σ(A) and σ(A∗) of operators A and A∗
satisfy the equality
σ(A) = σ(A∗).
Proof.– The solution of (λI −A∗)ϕ = ψ with ψ ∈C∗is
ϕ(θ) = e−λθϕ(0) +
 θ
0
eλ(s−θ)ψ(s) ds
;
θ ∈[0, r]
where ϕ(0) is to be determined so that ϕ ∈D(A∗). We get to
(λI −Lλ∗) (ϕ(0)) = ψ(0) + L∗

 θ
0
eλ(s−θ)ψ(s) ds

.
The right hand side of the above formula is similar to the operator Sλ
deﬁned in (2.8), but let us notice that it is not the adjoint of Sλ. We
will denote it Sλ, that is,
Sλ(ψ) = ψ(0) + L∗

 θ
0
eλ(s−θ)ψ(s) ds

.
316

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
Since Sλ is onto, we conclude that λ ∈σ(A∗) if and only if λ ∈σ(Lλ∗).
We have seen above that λ ∈σ(A) if and only if λ ∈σ(Lλ) and it is
well known that σ(Lλ) = σ(Lλ∗) ([39]). Therefore the result follows.
Notice that
N (λI −A) = {ελ ⊗x ; x ∈N (λI −Lλ)}
N (µI −A∗) = {ε−µ ⊗x∗; x∗∈N (µI −Lµ∗)}.
Also, let us mention that if λ, µ are eigenvalues of A, A∗respectively,
and λ ̸= µ, then << α, ϕ >>= 0 for all α ∈N (µI −A∗), ϕ ∈N (λI −A).
Indeed,
<< A∗α, ϕ >>= µ << α, ϕ >>=<< α, Aϕ >>= λ << α, ϕ >>
therefore the condition λ ̸= µ implies that << α, ϕ >>= 0.
Proposition 39 The subspace R (λI −A∗) is closed in C∗if and only
if R (λI −A) is closed in C.
Proof.– Arguments similar to the ones used in the proofs of Lemmas
35 and 36 lead to
a) For any λ ∈C we have that α ∈R (λI −A∗) if and only if
Sλ(α) ∈R (λI −Lλ∗).
b) The subspace R (λI −A∗) is closed in C∗if and only if R (λI −Lλ∗)
is closed in E∗.
The proof is concluded by recalling the known result that R (λI −Lλ)
is a closed subspace in E if and only if R (λI −Lλ∗) is closed in E∗.

Application to the model of cell population
dynamics
We will now see how the theory developped in this section applies to
equation (1.20). To this end, it is convenient to express the equation
in a more general setting. First of all, there is a support property for
solutions of (1.5), namely, both the functions n and ∆n(t, ·) have their
support contained in some compact interval [A1, A2].
Therefore, the
integrals on the right-hand side of (1.20) are restricted to this interval.

Conclusion
The material presented in this section is mainly preparatory.
We
have now a formal dual product as well as a formal adjoint equation. In
the next section, we will use these notions in the study of the spectral
decomposition associated to abstract D.D.E. In as much as possible,
we follow the method elaborated by J. Hale in [74], [75] and others for
D.D.E. in ﬁnite dimensions. One of the problems when going from ﬁnite
to inﬁnite dimensions is that the representation of a linear functional
in the inﬁnite dimensional framework is not always possible, or at least
not at all as easy to use as in ﬁnite dimensions. First of all, it is in
general necessary to embed the equation in a much larger space with
no nice way to identify the original problem in the larger one. As a
result, it is in general impossible to describe the dual product to a large
extent. For most computations, however, it is suﬃcient to use it for
special functions in the formal dual space for which such a description
is feasible. A second crucial diﬀerence which will appear when dealing
with spectral decomposition is the lack of compactness in general D.D.E.

Linear Theory Of Abstract Functional
Diﬀerential Equations Of Retarded Type
Let us recall that the subject of this section is the abstract D.D.E.:
x′(t) = L(xt)
,
t > 0
(4.1)
where L : C −→E is a bounded linear operator and E is a Banach space.
We know that the Cauchy problem for (4.1) is well posed and the
general solution gives rise to a strongly continuous semigroup of bounded
linear operators.
We have associated to the problem a dual product
between C and C∗:= C([0, r] , E∗) and an adjoint equation.
One way to look at the dual product is to consider that it provides
a dynamic system of coordinates which allows, for example, to better
investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions and the stability of the
system. This goes through a decomposition of the state space C into the
sum of a stable and an unstable part, or more generally, the sum of the
most unstable and a more stable part.
Since we are in the inﬁnite dimensional case, there is a basic feature of
the semigroup in ﬁnite dimensions which will generally be lacking: the
eventual compactness of the semigroup. Eventual compactness reduces
the problem to the study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
generator, and in many situations all amounts to looking at the real
part of the roots of a characteristic equation. In the general situation,
not much could be said. However, in the applications we have in view,
320

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
it happens often that the most unstable part of the spectrum leads to
a decomposition of the state space and allows the same study as in
the case of eventual compactness. This is when the most unstable part
of the spectrum of the semigroup is non essential, a situation that has
been encountered by several authors in the study of population dynamics
models in the eighties ([42]).
The notion of essential/non essential spectrum however is a general
one which was introduced in the sixties in connection with the study of
partial diﬀerential equations. The next section presents a short survey
of the subject. It is based on a review paper [1].
4.1
Some spectral properties of C0-semigroups
We start considering a linear closed operator A with dense domain
D(A) ⊂E, E being a Banach space. The spectrum of A, denoted σ(A),
is the set of λ ∈C, such that λI −A is not boundedly invertible. The
complementary set in C, ρ(A) := C/σ(A) is the resolvent set. We refer
the reader to [15], [21], [77], [35], [37] for the general theory.
The spectrum of A can be subdivided into three disjoint subsets
σ(A) = σP (A) ∪σC(A) ∪σR(A)
where
i) σP (A) is the point spectrum, that is, the set of λ ∈C such that
λI −A is not injective;
ii) σC(A) is the continuous spectrum, that is, the set of λ ∈C such
that λI −A is injective and the range of λI −A, denoted by
R (λI −A), is not E, but is dense in E;
iii) σR(A) is the residual spectrum, that is, the set of λ ∈C such that
λI −A is injective and R (λI −A) is not dense in E.
There are other ways to divide the spectrum. We will in fact consider
another one, in addition to the one we have just given ([10]):
The essential spectrum of A, σe(A), is the set of λ ∈σ(A) such that
at least one of the following holds:
i) R (λI −A) is not closed.
ii) The generalized eigenspace associated to λ, N(λI−A) := ∪∞
m=1Ker
(λI −A)m is inﬁnite dimensional.
iii) λ is a limit point of σ(A).
321

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The complementary set, (σ\σe) (A) is called the non-essential spec-
trum.
There are relationships between the two partitions of σ(A). We refer
to Theorem 3 in [1] for some results on this issue.
Let B be a bounded linear operator on some Banach space E, i.e.
E ∈L(E) and let f : Ω⊂C −→C be an holomorphic function with
σ(B) ⊂Ω.
The spectral theorem states that f(B) can be deﬁned as a bounded
linear operator on E and also:
σ(f(B)) = f(σ(B)).
This theorem extends partially to the case of an unbounded linear op-
erator. If A is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a strongly continuous linear
semigroup {T(t)}t≥0 (that can be, with some abuse, viewed as a gen-
eralized exponential operator exp(tA)), then the point spectrum, the
residual spectrum as well as the non essential spectrum of A and T(t)
correspond to each other in the simplest way possible, namely,
σ∗
J(T(t)) =
0
etλ ; λ ∈σJ(A)
1
where J can be either P (the point spectrum) or R (the residual spec-
trum) or NE (the non-essential spectrum), and the notation σ∗indicates
that we are not counting 0 which might be a spectral value of T(t) (and
is indeed for t > 0 in the case of compact semigroups), while obviously
it cannot arise from the spectrum of A.
But no such relationship can be asserted in general for the continuous
spectrum or the essential spectrum. Examples of spectral values of the
semigroup (other than 0) which do not arise from the spectrum of the
generator can be found in the literature ([21]).
In this direction the
following partial result can be shown:
exp(tσe(A)) ⊂σe(T(t))
,
t > 0.
This fact can be used if some information about the essential spec-
trum of the semigroup is avalaible.
For example, if we know that it
is contained in the interior of the unit disk, for some t > 0. In this
case, either the whole spectrum of T(t) is located in the interior of the
unit disk, which provides exponential stability of the semigroup, or there
are spectral values of T(t) which exceed in magnitude, the ones in the
essential spectrum. These values are the ones which matter regarding
the stability issue: they are non essential and thus emanate from the
generator.
322

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
This result shows that it is important to have means to estimate
the essential spectrum of an operator and possibly also of a semigroup
of operators. We will now quote the few results known on this issue.
The crucial point here is that the generator does not help at all at this
point. Then we will proceed to the next step, that is to say, the spectral
decomposition associated with the non essential spectrum. We will see
that it works much the same as in ﬁnite dimensions.
We will end this section providing some estimates of the essential
spectrum.
Let B be a linear bounded operator deﬁned on the Banach space E.
The spectral radius of B is the number
r(B) :=
sup
λ∈σ(B)
|λ|.
There is a formula for the computation of the spectral radius which does
not use the spectrum:
r(B) = lim
n→∞∥Bn∥1/n.
Accordingly, the essential spectral radius of B is deﬁned by:
re(B) :=
sup
λ∈σe(B)
|λ|.
The computation of the essential spectral radius is a little more involved,
it has in fact to do with the distance of the operator to the set of compact
operators. Notice that for compact operators, the essential spectrum
reduces to {0}, thus the essential spectral radius is equal to 0. The
following formula was proved by R. Nussbaum ([32]). It uses the notion
of measure of noncompactness for sets and operators, which we recall in
the following.
Let U be a bounded subset of E. The measure of noncompactness of
U is the number α(U) deﬁned by:
α(U) := inf
3
ε > 0 ;
U can be covered by a ﬁnite number of
subsets of E of diameter less than ε.
4
In particular, the following is obvious: α(U) = 0 if and only if U has a
compact closure.
The above deﬁnition of measure of noncompactness can be extended
to bounded operators B ∈L(E):
α(B) := sup
3α(B(U))
α(U)
; U ⊂E bounded and α(U) ̸= 0
4
.
323

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
We can now state the formula for the essential spectral radius ([32]):
re(B) = lim
n→∞α(Bn)1/n.
Finally, the following quantity may also be of interest. The spectral
bound of a linear closed operator A, denoted s(A), is deﬁned by:
s(A) := sup {Re λ ; λ ∈σ(A)} .
Corresponding to the spectral radius of an operator is the growth
bound of a semigroup {T(t)}t≥0. It is the quantity ω0 deﬁned by:
ω0 :=
lim
t→+∞log ∥T(t)∥.
The connection between the growth bound and the spectral radius is
what the intuition suggests it should be, that is:
∀t > 0
,
r(T(t)) = eω0t.
Accordingly we can deﬁne the essential growth bound of the semigroup.
It is the quantity ω1 deﬁned by:
ω1 :=
lim
t→+∞log α [T(t)] .
We also have the expected relationship
re(T(t)) = eω1t.
The potential interest of the theory that will be presented next lies in
the following formula ([42]):
ω0 = max
-
ω1
,
sup
λ∈(σ\σe)(A)
Re λ
.
.
If we can compute or at least estimate ω1 and show that ω1 < ω0 or
ω1 < s(A), then the growth bound will be determined by the non-
essential spectrum of the generator.
4.2
Decomposition of the state space
C([−r, 0]; E)
Let σ(A), σe(A) be the spectrum and the essential spectrum respec-
tively of the inﬁnitesimal generator A of the semigroup {T(t)}t≥0 de-
ﬁned by the solutions to (4.1). From the general theory about operator
reduction for isolated points of the spectrum ([77], [42]), we obtain the
following theorem which yields the decomposition of C into a direct sum:
324

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
Theorem 2 Let λ ∈(σ\σe) (A). Then λ is an eigenvalue of A and for
some positive integer m we have
C = N (λI −A)m ⊕R (λI −A)m
where N (λI −A)m is the generalized eigenspace of A with respect to λ
and dim N (λI −A)m = q < +∞.
Moreover A is completely reduced by this decomposition, A restricted
to N (λI −A)m is bounded with spectrum {λ} and the subspaces N (λI −
A)m, R (λI −A)m are invariant under the semigroup {T(t)}t≥0.
The description of the fundamental solution matrix associated with
a ﬁnite dimensional invariant subspace done in [74] for problem (4.1) in
ﬁnite-dimensional spaces remains valid without essential modiﬁcations.
Some of the properties owe to translation semigroup features enjoyed by
abstract D.D.E. and are valid in a much more general context.
Let Φλ = (ϕ1, . . . , ϕq) be a basis for N (λI −A)m. There is a q × q
constant matrix Bλ such that ˙Φλ = ΦλBλ and λ is the unique eigenvalue
of Bλ. Therefore
Φλ(θ) = Φλ(0)eBλθ ,
θ ∈[−r, 0]
and also
T(t)Φλ = ΦλeBλt ,
t > 0.
Furthermore, if the initial value ϕ of (4.1) belongs to N (A −λI)m,
we have ϕ = Φλa for some q-vector a and the solution is deﬁned by
xt = T(t)ϕ = T(t)Φλa = ΦλeBλta ,
t > 0.
The same theory applies for a ﬁnite subset of (σ\σe) (A) and gives
a very clear description of the geometric behaviour of the solutions of
(4.1). We summarize these results in the following theorem.
Theorem 3 Suppose Λ = {λ1 . . . λs} is any ﬁnite subset of the non-
essential spectrum of A, (σ\σe) (A), and let ΦΛ := (Φλ1, . . . , Φλs), BΛ :=
diag (Bλ1, . . . , Bλs), where Φλj is a basis of the generalized eigenspace
associated to λj, N (λjI −A)mj, with dim N (λjI −A)mj = qj < +∞,
and Bλj is a constant matrix such that AΦλj = ΦλjBλj.
The only
eigenvalue of Bλj is λj, j = 1, . . . , s.
Moreover, let
PΛ := N (λ1I −A)m1 ⊕· · · ⊕N (λsI −A)ms.
Then there exists a subspace QΛ of C invariant under A and {T(t)}t≥0,
such that
C = PΛ ⊕QΛ
325

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
and the operator A is completely reduced by this decomposition. Fur-
thermore, for any initial value ϕ = ΦΛa where a is a constant vector of
dimension q1 + · · · + qs, the solution of the Cauchy problem associated
to ( 4.1) is deﬁned by
xt = T(t)ϕ = T(t)ΦΛa = ΦΛeBΛta ,
t ≥0.
We say that A is reduced by Λ.
4.3
A Fredholm alternative principle
What we want to do next is to use the formal duality presented in the
previous section to obtain an explicit characterization for the projection
operator on the subspace QΛ. The ﬁrst result is a Fredholm alternative
principle for the characterization of the range of λI −A.
Proposition 40 Let λ ∈(σ\σe) (A). Then, f ∈R (λI −A) if and only
if << α, f >>= 0 for all α = ε−λ ⊗x∗, with x∗∈N (λI −(Lλ)∗) where
(Lλ)∗is the adjoint of operator Lλ.
Proof.– Since λ ∈(σ\σe) (A), we have that R (λI −A) is closed,
so Lemma 36 gives that R (λI −Lλ) is closed in E. Therefore we can
identify an element in the range of λI −Lλ in terms of the null space
of the natural adjoint of this operator. Now, given f in C, Lemma 35
tells us that f ∈R (λI −A) if and only if Sλ(f) ∈R (λI −Lλ), which
holds if and only if < x∗, Sλ(f) >= 0 for all x∗∈N (λI −(Lλ)∗). But,
according to formula (3.2), we have < x∗, Sλ(f) >=<< ε−λ ⊗x∗, f >>,
which completes the proof of the proposition.
We can state Proposition 40 in a Fredholm alternative principle form:
Let λ ∈(σ\σe) (A). Then, the equation (λI −A)ψ = ϕ has a solution
if and only if << ελ ⊗x∗, ϕ >>= 0 for all x∗∈N (λI −(Lλ)∗).
4.4
Characterization of the subspace
R (λI −A)m for λ in (σ\σe) (A)
The fact that λ is non essential ensures that R (λI−A)m is closed with
a ﬁnite codimension, and there is an integer m0 such that R (λI −A)m
is the same for all m ≥m0. The computations we are going to present
now are similar to the ones performed in ﬁnite dimensions. In fact, those
computations are in some sense valid in general. But, in the case when
λ is an essential spectral value, the computation will not be conclusive.
The main point is that the equation which is originally set up in C will

reduce to an equation in the product space Em. In fact, the solution to

ing that each ϕ(k) satiﬁes the boundary condition ˙ϕ(k)(0) = L(ϕ(k)). By

However, the converse statement is of a bigger interest to us. We begin
its analysis proving the following proposition.
Proposition 41 Let λ ∈(σ\σe) (A). Then Lλ(m) is a Fredholm opera-
tor for each m = 1, 2, . . .
The proof is an immediate consequence of the two next lemmas.
Lemma 41 If λ ∈(σ\σe) (A), then λI −Lλ is a Fredholm operator.
Proof.– Since λ ∈(σ\σe) (A), from Lemma 36 we infer that R (λI −
Lλ) is a closed subspace in E. On the other hand, using Lemma 34
and Lemma 35, we can see that Sλ (R (λI −A)) = R (λI −Lλ) and
S−1
λ
(R (λI −Lλ)) = R (λI −A). Select a ﬁnite dimension vector space
M complementing R (λI −A) in C, which can be done since, by assump-
tion, R (λI −A) has a ﬁnite codimension.
From what precedes we deduce that Sλ(M) ∩R (λI −Lλ) = {0} and
Sλ(M)+R (λI −Lλ) = E. So, we have proved that R (λI −Lλ) is closed
with a ﬁnite codimension.
Finally, N (λI −A) is spanned by the functions ελ ⊗u with u ∈
N (λI −Lλ), then dim N (λI −Lλ) < +∞.
Therefore, λI −Lλ is a Fredholm operator.

A theory of linear DDE in inﬁnite dimensional spaces
where the operators ∗are in L(E), is a Fredholm operator.
Proof.– Fredholm operators can be characterized as follows: let F ∈
L(E). Then, F is Fredholm if and only there exist two operators D and
G in L(E) such that F ◦D = I + δ and G ◦F = I + γ, where δ and γ
are ﬁnite rank operators.
Assuming that the Aj, 1 ≤j ≤m, are Fredholm operators, we can
determine Dj, δj (resp. Gj, γj) in L(E) such that Aj ◦Dj = I +δj (resp.
Gj ◦Aj = I + γj), with the δj and the γj having a ﬁnite rank. Deﬁne
the following operator on Em:
D :=

The ﬁrst matrix U in the right-hand side is invertible and the second
one, ·, is a ﬁnite rank operator. Multiplying the above expression on
both sides by U−1 leads to
A(m)DU−1 = I + ∆U−1.
Obviously, ∆U−1 has a ﬁnite rank. Proceeding exactly the same way on
the left, we can also determine an operator 5G in L(Em) such that
5GA(m) = I + ˜∆
where ˜∆is a ﬁnite rank operator.
Therefore, A(m) is a Fredholm operator.

Characterization of the projection operator
onto the subspace QΛ
We recall the conclusion of Theorem 2, that is, for λ ∈(σ\σe) (A),
there exists a positive integer m for which a direct sum decomposition
of the following type holds:

We wish to ﬁnd a suitable coordinate system which serves in char-
acterizing the projection operator onto the subspace R (λI −A)m. To
this end, it is ﬁrst convenient to investigate the relationship between the

but in gen-
eral, even for Fredholm operators, we have p ̸= q. We now show that
q ≤p and next we will obtain some suﬃcient conditions for p = q.
Let Ψλ = (ψ1, . . . , ψq) be a basis for the subspace N (λI −A)m and
Ψ∗
λ = (α∗

p)T a basis for Kλ(m)∗, and make up the constant p × q
matrix M:
M :=<< Ψ∗
λ, Ψλ >>:= [<< α∗

(4.3)
If (λ1, . . . , λq)T ∈N (M), then << α∗, λ1ψ1 + · · · + λqψq >>= 0 for
all α∗in Kλ(m)∗and Proposition 42 implies that λ1ψ1 + · · · + λqψq ∈
R (λI −A)m. But we also have λ1ψ1 + · · · + λqψq ∈N (λI −A)m and
then λ1ψ1+· · ·+λqψq = 0. Therefore λi = 0, i = 1, . . . , q, N (M) = {0}.
Thus we conclude that M has rank q, implying that q ≤p.
In particular we can choose two new bases Φλ := (ϕ1, . . . , ϕq), Φ∗
λ :=
(ϕ∗
1, . . . , ϕ∗
p)T such that the constant p × q matrix satisﬁes
<< Φ∗

where δij is the Kronecker symbol.
We summarize all of this in a theorem:
Theorem 4 If λ ∈(σ\σe) (A), then dim N (λI −A)m ≤dim Kλ(m)∗
and there exist two bases Φλ = (ϕ1, . . . , ϕq), Φ∗
λ = (ϕ∗

subspaces N(λI −A)m and Kλ(m)∗respectively such that
<< Φ∗

Moreover, for each ϕ ∈C([−r, 0]; E) we have a unique decomposition
ϕ = ϕK + ϕI with ϕK ∈N (λI −A)m, ϕI ∈R (λI −A)m and <<
ϕ∗

Also ϕK = q

Next we relate the matrices Bλ, B∗

It is easy to check that for α = f ⊗u∗, f ∈C1([0, r]), u∗∈E∗and

Thus, for α ∈Kλ(m)∗and ϕ ∈D(A),
<< α, ˙ϕ >> + << ˙α, ϕ >>= 0.
Therefore

Notice that for p = q the last relation reduces to

Next we state some suﬃcient conditions to have p = q.
Lemma 43 If the formal duality is non degenerate then p = q.
Proof.– As usual, we say that the formal duality is non degenerate if
the equality << α, ϕ >>= 0, for all ϕ ∈C, implies that α = 0.

that p ≤q, so p = q.
The converse is not true in general. There are examples for ﬁnite di-

Let Λ = {λ1, . . . , λs} be a ﬁnite subset of non essential points of
σ(A) and consider the decomposition of the space C([−r, 0]; E) stated
in Theorem 3. We are now able to characterize the subspace QΛ by an
orthogonality relation associated with the formal duality.
To this end, we deﬁne

Next, let Φj, Φ∗

the matrix J of order (p1 + · · · + ps) × (q1 + · · · + qs),

QΛ = {ϕ ∈C ; << Φ∗

Moreover, any ϕ ∈C may be written as ϕ = ϕPΛ + ϕQΛ with <<

Conclusion
Several extensions of Hale’s theory of functional diﬀerential equations
to inﬁnite dimensions exist in the literature, starting from the one given
by C.C. Travis and G.F. Webb [94]. The main motivation is the study of
partial diﬀerential equations with ﬁnite or inﬁnite delay. In most cases,
the equation is of the form
x′(t) = Ax(t) +
 0
−r
dη(s)x(t + s)
where A generates a C0-semigroup on a Banach space X and dη is a
suitable restricted Stieltjes measure with values in L(X) (see [78], [79],
[38], to quote a few). Another important motivation is related to control
theory. Increasingly elaborate extensions of earlier work by C. Bernier
and A. Manitius, [9], [27], on attainability completeness or degeneracy,
to the case of partial diﬀerential equations with delays have been given
by S. Nakagiri [29], [30], [31]. The work done by S. Nakagiri includes
results on the spectral theory of such equations and the characterization
of some generalized eigenspaces in terms of the solutions of an adjoint
equation. Many of the considerations of this author are similar to ours.
The results diﬀer in that some restrictions are imposed by Nakagiri on
the measure, which takes the form
 0
−r
dη(s)ϕ(s) =

Aiϕ(−τi) +
 0
−r
D(s)ϕ(s) ds
with Ai ∈L(X), D ∈L1 ((−r, 0); L(X)). Moreover, it is assumed that
the space X is reﬂexive. In contrast, we make no hypotheses on the
functional term or on the space.

A Variation Of Constants Formula For An
Abstract Functional Diﬀerential Equation Of
Retarded Type
The aim of this section is to obtain a variation of constants formula
for an abstract linear nonhomogeneous retarded functional diﬀerential
equation. We will follow the work made in [7].
335

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
5.1
The nonhomogeneous problem
Let us consider the Cauchy problem for the nonhomogeneous retarded
functional equation:
(NH)
3
x′(t)
=
L(xt) + f(t) , t ≥0
x0
=
ϕ
where L : C([−r, 0]; E) −→E, (r > 0), is a bounded linear operator, E
is a Banach space, f : [0, τ ∗[−→E (τ ∗> 0) is a continuous function and
ϕ ∈C := C([−r, 0]; E).
A solution of this problem is a function x ∈C([−r, τ ∗[; E), x ∈
C1([0, τ ∗[; E) which satisﬁes (NH) for t ≥0.
Uniqueness of solution for (NH) follows immediately from that of the
homogeneous problem. Regarding the existence we observe that if xH is
a solution of (CP) and xP is a solution of the particular nonhomogeneous
problem
3
x′(t)
=
L(xt) + f(t) ;
t ≥0
x0
=
0
(5.1)
then x = xH + xP satisﬁes (NH). But we already know existence and
uniqueness of xH for each initial value ϕ ∈C([−r, 0]; E). Then it is
enough to prove the existence of xP .
Proposition 43 Given f ∈C([0, +∞[; E), there exists a unique func-
tion xP ∈C([−r, +∞[; E) ∩C1([0, +∞[; E) which satisﬁes ( 5.1) on
[0, +∞[.
Proof.– For each ﬁxed T > 0, let us consider the space
C0([0, T]; E) := {ϕ ∈C([0, T]; E) ; ϕ(0) = 0}
and the operator Π : [0, T] × C0([0, T]; E) −→C([−r, 0]; E) deﬁned by
Π(t, ϕ) :=
3
0 ,
if
t + θ < 0
ϕ(t + θ) ,
if
t + θ ≥0.
If we extend ϕ by zero to the interval [−r, T], it is easy to see that
Π(t, ϕ) = ϕt and then (5.1) is equivalent to the integral problem
x(t) =
 t

where K is the bounded linear operator deﬁned on C0([0, T]; E) by
Ku(t) =

L(Π(s, u)) ds.
It is enough to prove that I −K is invertible. Since
∥Ku∥C([0,T];E) ≤T∥L∥∥u∥C([0,T];E)
we obtain the following estimations for the iterates of K:
∥Kn∥≤∥L∥nT n
n!
;
n = 1, 2, . . .
and the result follows easily.
5.2
Semigroup deﬁned in L(E)
For each Φ ∈C([−r, 0]; L(E)), b ∈E, let Φ ⊗b ∈C([−r, 0]; E) be the
function deﬁned by
(Φ ⊗b) (θ) := Φ(θ)(b)
;
θ ∈[−r, 0]
and then consider the bounded linear operator
˜L : C([−r, 0]; L(E)) −→L(E)
˜L(Φ)(b) := L(Φ ⊗b).
Theorem 1 can be used to conclude that the Cauchy problem
3
V ′(t)
=
˜L(Vt)
;
t ≥0
V0
=
Φ
(5.2)
has a unique solution for each initial value Φ ∈C([−r, 0]; L(E)). Also,
this solution deﬁnes on C([−r, 0]; L(E)) a strongly continuous transla-
tion semigroup { ˜T(t)}t≥0 such that ˜T(t)Φ = Vt, t ≥0.
The inﬁnitesimal generator of this semigroup is
˜AΦ := ˙Φ
;
D( ˜A) := {Φ ∈C([−r, 0]; L(E)) ; ˙Φ(0) = ˜L(Φ)}.
Proposition 44 The semigroup {T(t)}t≥0 associated to the solution of
(CP) is related to the semigroup { ˜T(t)}t≥0 by

˜T(t)Φ

(θ)(b) = T(t) (Φ ⊗b) (θ)
;
∀b ∈E
;
θ ∈[−r, 0].
Proof.– Let {U(t)}t≥0 be the family of bounded linear operators deﬁned
in E by:
U(t)(b) := T(t) (Φ ⊗b) (0)
;
t ≥0.
337

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Since {T(t)}t≥0 is a translation semigroup, for t > 0, θ ∈[−r, 0], t + θ ≥
0, we have:
Ut(θ)(b) = T(t + θ) (Φ ⊗b) (0) = T(t) (Φ ⊗b) (θ)
and U = Φ in [−r, 0].
Also, for t > 0, θ ∈[−r, 0], t + θ ≤0,
Ut(θ)(b) = Φ(t + θ)(b) = (Φ ⊗b) (t + θ) = T(t) (Φ ⊗b) (θ).
Next, we look at the equation. We have
˜L(Ut)(b) = L(Ut ⊗b) = L (T(t) (Φ ⊗b))
;
t ≥0.
Now, let Φ ∈D( ˜A) be the initial value in problem (5.2) . It is easy to
prove that Φ ⊗b ∈D(A) for all b ∈E, and then
U′(t)(b) = T(t)A (Φ ⊗b) (0) = AT(t) (Φ ⊗b) (0) = L (T(t) (Φ ⊗b)) = ˜L(Ut)(b).
That is, the function U ∈C([0, +∞[; L(E)) satisﬁes (5.2). So, Ut =
˜T(t)Φ, by deﬁnition of the semigroup { ˜T(t)}t≥0 and uniqueness of the so-
lution of equation (5.2). Finally, by density of D( ˜A) in C([−r, 0]; L(E)),
equality extends to all Φ.
The proof of the proposition is complete.
5.3
The fundamental solution
Let e ∈E be given. We denote by xe(t) the unique solution of the
problem
3
x′(t)
=
L(yt) + e ; t ≥0
x0
=
0,
which, in integral form, reads as:
(xe)(t) =
 t
0
L(xe
s) ds + et
,
t ≥0.
(5.3)
We now deﬁne the fundamental solution of (NH).
Deﬁnition 41 The fundamental solution of problem (NH) is the family
of operators {U(t)}t≥0, U(t) : E −→E, deﬁned by
U(t)e := (xe)′(t)
;
t ≥0.
Observe that U(0) = I and U(t)e = L(xte) + e. Also, it is easy to prove
that for each e ∈E ﬁxed, the function t −→U(t)e is continuous in R+.
338

Lemma 46 For all t ≥0, we have U(t) ∈L(E).

We are now going to prove the continuity in R+ of the function t −→
U(t) and to this end we need to introduce another family of operators
which is related to the fundamental solution by integration.
More precisely, let {V(t)}t≥0 be the family of operators deﬁned by:
V(t) : E −→E
;
V(t)e := xe(t).
We have
V(t)e =

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The above inequality yields local Lipschitz continuity.
We extend V to the interval [−r, 0] by 0. Since V(0) = 0, local Lip-
schitz continuity is preserved. It also holds for the map t −→Vt from R+
into C([−r, 0]; L(E)). Therefore, the same holds for the map t −→˜L(Vt).
Observe that
xe
s(θ) = xe(s + θ) = V(s + θ)(e) = Vs(θ)e = (Vs ⊗e) (θ)
hence
L(xe
s) = L (Vs ⊗e) = ˜L (Vs) (e).
Substituting the right-hand side of the above formula for L(xe
s) in (5.3),
we arrive at
V(t) =
 t
0
˜L(Vs) ds + tI
;
t ≥0
(5.4)
from which, in view of local Lipschitz continuity of ˜L(Vt), we can con-
clude that V(t) is continuously diﬀerentiable for t ≥0 and it holds:
V′(t) = ˜L(Vt) + I
;
t ≥0.
(5.5)
An immediate consequence of Proposition 45 is the continuity of the
fundamental solution:
Corollary 6 The function t −→U(t) is continuous from R+ into L(E).
The fundamental solution satisﬁes a retarded equation which is for-
mally similar to (5.2). To see this, we extend by zero the fundamental
solution to the interval [−r, 0[. Since U(0) = I, the extension is not
continuous but we can deﬁne the sections of U(t).
These sections are related to V(t) by:
Vt(θ) = V(t + θ) =
 t+θ
0
U(s) ds =



0 ,
if
t + θ < 0

and therefore we can easily show:
Vt(θ) =
 t

Uτ(θ) dτ
;
t ≥0
;
θ ∈[−r, 0].
From (5.5) we conclude that the fundamental solution satisﬁes the Cauchy

5.4
The fundamental solution and the
nonhomogeneous problem
We keep the above notations and we are going to express the solu-
tion of the particular nonhomogeneous problem (5.1) in terms of the
fundamental solution.
Theorem 7 Let xP be the solution of ( 5.1). Then we have:
xP (t) =

U(t −s) (f(s)) ds
;
t ≥0.
Proof.– By arguments similar to those employed in Lemma 46, we can
prove the continuous dependence of xP upon the function f. Hence it
is enough to choose f ∈C1([0, T]; E), T > 0.
In this case we have

Observe that y is continuous in [−r, +∞[, since y(0) = 0, but we do
not assure the diﬀerentiability of y in t = 0.
We now prove that y satisﬁes the same equation as xP :

Finally, we can also express the solution of the homogeneous equation,

ϕ(0)
if

Changing the unknown function x into y, deﬁned by

we have that y satisﬁes the nonhomogeneous problem:

Rewriting ˜ϕ in the form

Comparing this representation with the solution of the homogeneous
Cauchy problem associated with a constant initial data, we conclude
that the ﬁrst term is the restriction of the semigroup {T(t)}t≥0 to the
constant functions.

Introduction
Let (X, |·|) be an inﬁnite dimensional Banach space and L(X) be the
space of bounded linear operators from X into X. Suppose that r > 0
is a given real number. C ([−r, 0] , X) denotes the space of continuous
functions from [−r, 0] to X with the uniform convergence topology and
we will use simply CX for C ([−r, 0] , X). For u ∈C ([−r, b] , X), b > 0
and t ∈[0, b], let ut denote the element of CX deﬁned by ut(θ) = u(t +
θ), −r ≤θ ≤0.
By an abstract semilinear functional diﬀerential equation on the space
X, we mean an evolution equation of the type
 du
dt (t) = A0u(t) + F(t, ut),
t ≥0,
u0 = ϕ,
(1.1)
where A0 : D(A0) ⊆X →X is a linear operator, F is a function
from [0, +∞) × CX into X and ϕ ∈CX are given.
The initial value
problem associated with (1.1) is the following : given ϕ ∈CX, to ﬁnd a

continuous function u : [−r, h) →X, h > 0, diﬀerentiable on [0, h) such
that u(t) ∈D(A0), for t ∈[0, h) and u satisﬁes the evolution equation
of (1.1) for t ∈[0, h) and u0 = ϕ.
It is well-known (see for example [94] and [96]) that the classical semi-
group theory ensures the well posedness of Problem (1.1) when A0 is the
inﬁnitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup of bounded linear operators
(T0(t))t≥0 in X or, equivalently when
(i) D(A0) = X,
(ii) there exist M0, ω0 ∈IR such that if λ > ω0
(λI −A0)−1 ∈L(X)
and
22(λ −ω0)n (λI −A0)−n22 ≤M0,
∀n ∈N.
In this case one can prove existence and uniqueness of a solution of (1.1),
for example by using the variation-of-constants formula ([94], [96])
u(t) =
3
T0(t)ϕ(0) +
 t
0 T0(t −s)F(s, us)ds,
if t ≥0,
ϕ(t),
if t ∈[−r, 0] ,
for every ϕ ∈CX.
For related results, see for example Travis and Webb [94], Webb [95],
Fitzgibbon [72], Kunish and Schappacher ([78], [79]), Memory ([82],
[83]), Wu [96], and the references therein. In all of the quoted papers,
A0 is an operator verifying (i) and (ii). In the applications, it is some-
times convenient to take initial functions with more restrictions. There
are many examples in concrete situations where evolution equations are
not densely deﬁned. Only hypothesis (ii) holds. One can refer for this
to [64] for more details. Non-density occurs, in many situations, from
restrictions made on the space where the equation is considered (for ex-
ample, periodic continuous functions, H¨older continuous functions) or
from boundary conditions (e.g., the space C1 with null value on the
boundary is non-dense in the space of continuous functions. Let us now
brieﬂy discuss the use of integrated semigroups. In the case where the
mapping F in Equation (1.1) is equal to zero, the problem can still be
handled by using the classical semigroups theory because A0 generates
a strongly continuous semigroup in the space D(A0). But, if F ̸= 0, it
is necessary to impose additional restrictions.
A case which is easily
handled is when F takes their values in D(A0). On the other hand, the
integrated semigroups theory allows the range of the operators F to be
any subset of X.

In the two examples given here, the operator A0 satisﬁes (ii) but
the domain D(A0) is not dense in X and so, A0 does not generate a
C0−semigroup. Of course, there are many other examples encountered
in the applications in which the operator A0 satisﬁes only (ii) (see [64]).
349

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
We will study here the abstract semilinear functional diﬀerential equa-
tion (1.1) in the case when the operator A0 satisﬁes only the Hille-Yosida
condition (ii). After providing some background materials in Section 2,
we proceed to establish the main results. A natural generalized notion
of solutions is provided in Section 3 by integral solutions. We derive a
variation-of-constants formula which allows us to transform the integral
solutions of the general equation to solutions of an abstract Volterra
integral equation. We prove the existence, uniqueness, regularity and
continuous dependence on the initial condition. These results give nat-
ural generalizations of results in [94] and [96]. In Section 4, we consider
the autonomous case. We prove that the solutions generate a nonlinear
strongly continuous semigroup, which satisﬁes a compactness property.
In the linear case, the solutions are shown to generate a locally Lipschitz
continuous integrated semigroup. In Section 5, we use a principle of lin-
earized stability for strongly continuous semigroups given by Desh and
Schappacher [65] (see also [87], [88] and [90]) to study, in the nonlin-
ear autonomous case, the stability of Equation (1.1). In Section 6, we
show in the linear autonomous case, the existence of a direct sum de-
composition of a state space into three subspaces : stable, unstable and
center, which are semigroup invariants. As a consequence of the results
established in Section 6, the existence of bounded, periodic and almost
periodic solutions is established in the sections 7 and 8. In the end, we
give some examples.

Basic results
In this section, we give a short review of the theory of integrated
semigroups and diﬀerential operators with non-dense domain. We start
with a few deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 42 [56] Let X be a Banach space. A family (S(t))t≥0 ⊂
L(X) is called an integrated semigroup if the following conditions are
satisﬁed :
(i) S(0) = 0;
(ii) for any x ∈X, S(t)x is a continuous function of t ≥0 with values
in X;
(iii) for any t, s ≥0
S(s)S(t) =
 s
0
(S(t + τ) −S(τ))dτ.
Deﬁnition 43 [56] An integrated semigroup (S(t))t≥0 is called expo-
nentially bounded, if there exist constants M ≥0 and ω ∈IR such that
∥S(t)∥≤Meωt
for t ≥0.
350

Basic theory of abstract DFE with non-dense domain
Moreover (S(t))t≥0 is called non-degenerate if S(t)x = 0, for all t ≥0,
implies that x = 0.
If (S(t))t≥0 is an integrated semigroup, exponentially bounded, then
the Laplace transform R(λ) := λ
 +∞
0
e−λtS(t)dt exists for all λ with
Re(λ) > ω. R(λ) is injective if and only if (S(t))t≥0 is non-degenerate.
R(λ) satisﬁes the following expression
R(λ) −R(µ) = (µ −λ)R(λ)R(µ),
and in the case when (S(t))t≥0 is non-degenerate, there exists a unique
operator A satisfying (ω, +∞) ⊂ρ(A) (the resolvent set of A) such that
R(λ) = (λI −A)−1, for all Re(λ) > ω.
This operator A is called the generator of (S(t))t≥0.
We have the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 44 [56] An operator A is called a generator of an inte-
grated semigroup, if there exists ω ∈IR such that (ω, +∞) ⊂ρ(A), and
there exists a strongly continuous exponentially bounded family (S(t))t≥0
of linear bounded operators such that S(0) = 0 and (λI −A)−1 =

remark 2 If an operator A is the generator of an integrated semigroup
(S(t))t≥0, then ∀λ ∈IR, A −λI is the generator of the integrated semi-
group (Sλ(t))t≥0 given by
Sλ(t) = e−λtS(t) + λ

Proposition 47 [56] Let A be the generator of an integrated semigroup
(S(t))t≥0. Then for all x ∈X and t ≥0,

Moreover, for all x ∈D(A), t ≥0

and
AS(t)x = S(t)Ax,
and
S(t)x = tx +
 t

S(s)Ax ds.
351

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Corollary 1 [56] Let A be the generator of an integrated semigroup
(S(t))t≥0. Then for all x ∈X and t ≥0 one has S(t)x ∈D(A).
Moreover, for x ∈X, S(·)x is right-sided diﬀerentiable in t ≥0 if and
only if S(t)x ∈D(A). In that case
S′(t)x = AS(t)x + x.
An important special case is when the integrated semigroup is locally
Lipschitz continuous (with respect to time).
Deﬁnition 45 [81] An integrated semigroup (S(t))t≥0 is called locally
Lipschitz continuous, if for all τ > 0 there exists a constant k(τ) > 0
such that
∥S(t) −S(s)∥≤k(τ) |t −s| , for all t, s ∈[0, τ] .
In this case, we know from [81], that (S(t))t≥0 is exponentially bounded.
Deﬁnition 46 [81] We say that a linear operator A satisﬁes the Hille-
Yosida condition (HY) if there exist M ≥0 and ω ∈IR such that
(ω, +∞) ⊂ρ(A) and
sup
&
(λ −ω)n 22(λI −A)−n22 , n ∈N, λ > ω
'
≤M.
(HY)
The following theorem shows that the Hille-Yosida condition charac-
terizes generators of locally Lipschitz continuous integrated semigroups.
Theorem 2 [81] The following assertions are equivalent.
(i) A is the generator of a locally Lipschitz continuous integrated semi-
group,
(ii) A satisﬁes the condition (HY).
In the sequel, we give some results for the existence of solutions of the
following Cauchy problem
 du
dt (t) = Au(t) + f(t),
t ≥0,
u(0) = x ∈X,
(2.1)
where A satisﬁes the condition (HY), without being densely deﬁned.
By a solution of Problem (2.1) on [0, T] where T > 0, we understand
a function u ∈C1 ([0, T] , X) satisfying u(t) ∈D(A) (t ∈[0, T]) such that
the two relations in (2.1) hold.
The following result is due to Da Prato and Sinestrari.
352

Basic theory of abstract DFE with non-dense domain
Theorem 3 [64] Let A : D(A) ⊆X →X be a linear operator, f :
[0, T] →X, x ∈D(A) such that
(a) A satisﬁes the condition (HY).
(b) f(t) = f(0) +
 t
0 g(s) ds for some Bochner-integrable function g.
(c) Ax + f(0) ∈D(A).
Then there exists a unique solution u of Problem ( 2.1) on the interval
[0, T], and for each t ∈[0, T]
|u(t)| ≤Meωt

|x| +
 t

e−ωs |f(s)| ds

.
In the case where x is not suﬃciently regular (that is, x is just in
D(A)) there may not exist a strong solution u(t) ∈X but, following the
work of Da Prato and Sinestrari [64], Problem (2.1) may still have an
integral solution.
Deﬁnition 47 [64] Given f ∈L1
loc(0, +∞; X) and x ∈X, we say that
u : [0, +∞) →X is an integral solution of ( 2.1) if the following asser-
tions are true
(i) u ∈C([0, +∞) ; X),
(ii)

for t ≥0,
(iii) u(t) = x + A
 t
0

 t

for t ≥0.
¿From this deﬁnition, we deduce that for an integral solution u, we
have u(t) ∈D(A), for all t > 0, because u(t) = lim

 t+h

u(s)ds ∈D(A). In particular, x ∈D(A) is a necessary condition
for the existence of an integral solution of (2.1).
Theorem 4 [61] Suppose that A satisﬁes the condition (HY), x ∈
D(A) and f : [0, +∞) →X is a continuous function. Then the problem
( 2.1) has a unique integral solution which is given by
u(t) = S′(t)x + d
dt
 t

S(t −s)f(s)ds, pour t ≥0,
where S(t) is the integrated semigroup generated by A.

Existence, uniqueness and regularity of
solutions
We restate the problem
 du
dt (t) = A0u(t) + F(t, ut),
t ≥0,
u0 = ϕ ∈CX,
(1.1)
where F : [0, T] × CX →X is a continuous function.
Throughout this work, we assume that A0 satisﬁes the Hille-Yosida con-
dition on X :
(HY) there exist M0 ≥0 and ω0 ∈IR such that (ω0, +∞) ⊂ρ(A0) and
sup
&
(λ −ω0)n 22(λI −A0)−n22 , n ∈N, λ > ω0
'
≤M0.
We know from Theorem 2 that A0 is the generator of a locally Lip-
schitz continuous integrated semigroup (S0 (t))t≥0 on X, (and (S0 (t))t≥0
is exponentially bounded).
In view of the remark following Deﬁnition 44, we will sometimes as-
sume without loss of generality that ω0 = 0.
Consider ﬁrst the linear Cauchy problem
3
u′(t) = A0u(t),
t ≥0,
u0 = ϕ ∈CX.
This problem can be reformulated as a special case of an abstract semi-
linear functional diﬀerential equation with delay. This is
3
u′(t) = (Aut) (0) ,
t ≥0,
u0 = ϕ,
where
3
D(A) =
&
ϕ ∈C1 ([−r, 0] , X) ;
ϕ(0) ∈D(A0),
ϕ′(0) = A0ϕ(0)
'
,
Aϕ = ϕ′.
We can show, by using the next result and Theorem 2, that the op-
erator A satisﬁes the condition (HY).

for t ≥0, θ ∈[−r, 0] and ϕ ∈CX.
Proof. It is easy to see that (S(t))t≥0 is an integrated semigroup on
CX.
Consider τ > 0, t, s ∈[0, τ] and ϕ ∈CX.
If t + θ ≥0 and s + θ ≥0, we have
(S (t) ϕ) (θ) −(S(s)ϕ)(θ) = S0(t + θ)ϕ(0) −S0(s + θ)ϕ(0).
It follows immediately that there exists a constant k := k(τ) > 0 such
that
|(S (t) ϕ) (θ) −(S(s)ϕ) (θ)| ≤k |t −s| |ϕ(0)| ,
because (S0(t))t≥0 is Lipschitz continuous on [0, τ].
If t + θ ≤0 and s + θ ≤0, we have
|(S (t) ϕ) (θ) −(S(s)ϕ) (θ)| = 0.
If t + θ ≥0 and s + θ ≤0, we obtain
(S (t) ϕ) (θ) −(S(s)ϕ) (θ) = S0(t + θ)ϕ(0) +

s+θ
ϕ(u)du,
then
|(S (t) ϕ) (θ) −(S(s)ϕ) (θ)| ≤k (t + θ) |ϕ(0)| −(s + θ) ∥ϕ∥,
This implies that
∥S (t) −S(s)∥≤(k + 1) |t −s| .
It may be concluded that (S(t))t≥0 is locally Lipschitz continuous.
In order to prove that A is the generator of (S(t))t≥0, we calculate
the spectrum and the resolvent operator of A.
Consider the equation
(λI −A) ϕ = ψ,
where ψ is given in CX , and we are looking for ϕ ∈D(A). The above
equation reads
λϕ(θ) −ϕ′(θ) = ψ(θ),
θ ∈[−r, 0] .

ϕ is in D(A) if ϕ(0) ∈D(A0) and ϕ′(0) = A0ϕ(0), that is
ϕ(0) ∈D(A0)
and
(λI −A0) ϕ(0) = ψ(0).
By assumption on A0, we know that (0, +∞) ⊂ρ(A0). So, for λ > 0,
the above equation has a solution
ϕ(0) = (λI −A0)−1 ψ(0).
Therefore, (0, +∞) ⊂ρ(A)

On the other hand, from the formula stated in Proposition 48, it is
clear that t →(S(t)ϕ) (θ) has at most exponential growth, not larger
than ω0 = 0. Therefore, one can deﬁned its Laplace transform, for each

So, A is related to (S(t))t≥0 by the formula which characterizes the inﬁn-
itesimal generator of an integrated semigroup. The proof of Proposition
48 is complete
Our next objective is to construct an integrated version of Problem
(1.1) using integrated semigroups. We need to extend the integrated
semigroup (S(t))t≥0 to the space 5CX = CX ⊕⟨X0⟩, where
⟨X0⟩= {X0c,
c ∈X and (X0c) (θ) = X0(θ)c} and X0 denotes the func-
tion deﬁned by X0(θ) = 0 if θ < 0 and X0(0) = IdX. We shall prove
that this extension determines a locally Lipschitz continuous integrated
semigroup on 5CX.

Proof. Using the same reasoning as in the proof of Proposition 48,
one can show that (5S(t))t≥0 is a locally Lipschitz continuous integrated
semigroup on 5CX.

(λI −5A)−1(ϕ + X0c) = (λI −A)−1ϕ + eλ·(λI −A0)−1c,
for every (ϕ, c) ∈CX × X .
Proof of the lemma. For the proof of (i), we consider the following
operator
l : D( 5A) →X
ϕ →l(ϕ) = A0ϕ(0) −ϕ′(0).
Let 5Ψ ∈D( 5A) and λ > 0. Setting Ψ = 5Ψ−eλ·(λI−A0)−1l(5Ψ), we deduce
that Ψ ∈Ker(l) = D(A), and the decomposition is clearly unique.

We are now able to state a ﬁrst result of existence and uniqueness of
solutions.
Theorem 5 Let F : [0, T] × CX →X be continuous and satisfy a Lip-
schitz condition
|F(t, ϕ) −F (t, ψ)| ≤L ∥ϕ −ψ∥,
t ∈[0, T] and ϕ, ψ ∈CX,
where L is a positive constant.
Then, for given ϕ ∈CX, such that

Proof. Using the results of Theorem 4, the proof of this theorem is
standard.
Since ϕ(0) ∈D(A0), we have ϕ ∈D(A), where A is the generator
of the integrated semigroup (S(t))t≥0 on CX. Then, we deduce from
Corollary 1 that S(·)ϕ is diﬀerentiable and (S′(t))t≥0 can be deﬁned to
be a C0-semigroup on D(A).
Let (yn)n∈N be a sequence of continuous functions deﬁned by

Consequently, the limit y := lim

(3.4)
The assumptions of Theorem 10 imply that ϕ ∈D( 5A), 5Aϕ+g(0) ∈D( 5A)
and g is continuously diﬀerentiable on [0, T].
Using Theorem 3, we

Furthermore, the operator A0 is closed. Then, we obtain u(t) ∈D(A0)
and
u′(t) = A0u(t) + F(t, ut), for t ∈[0, T] .
The second part of the theorem is a consequence of Corollary 6

The condition (3.5) is stronger than (HY).
We have the following result.
Theorem 11 Suppose that A0 satisﬁes ( 3.5) (non-densely deﬁned) on

u of Equation (1) on [0, T] is continuously diﬀerentiable on (r, T] and
satisﬁes
u(t) ∈D(A0), u′(t) ∈D(A0) and
u′(t) = A0u(t) + F(t, ut),
for t ∈(r, T] .

where +C is a suitable oriented path in the complex plan.
Let u be the integral solution on [0, T] of Equation (1), which exists
by virtu of Theorem 5, and consider the function g : [0, T] →X deﬁned
by g(t) = F(t, ut). We deduce from ([89], p.106) that
u(t) = eA0tϕ(0) +

Using (Theorem 3.4, [91]), we obtain that the function u is γ−H¨older
continuous on [ε, T] for each ε > 0 and γ ∈]0, 1[ . Hence, there exists
L1 ≥0 such that
∥ut −us∥≤L1 |t −s|γ ,
for t, s ∈(r, T] .
On the other hand, we have
|g(t) −g(s)| ≤L(|t −s|α + ∥ut −us∥),
for t, s ∈[0, T] .
Consequently, the function t ∈(r, T] →g(t) is locally H¨older continuous.
By virtue of (Theorem 4.4 and 4.5, [91]), we deduce that u is contin-
uously diﬀerentiable on (r, T] and satisﬁes
u(t) ∈D(A0), u′(t) ∈D(A0) and
u′(t) = A0u(t) + F(t, ut),
for t ∈(r, T]
We prove now the local existence of integral solutions of Problem (1.1)
under a locally Lipschitz condition on F.
Theorem 12 Suppose that F : [0, +∞) × CX →X is continuous and
satisﬁes the following locally Lipschitz condition : for each α > 0 there
exists a constant C0(α) > 0 such that if t ≥0, ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈CX and
∥ϕ1∥, ∥ϕ2∥≤α then
|F(t, ϕ1) −F(t, ϕ2)| ≤C0(α) ∥ϕ1 −ϕ2∥.

Moreover, u(t, ϕ) is a continuous function of ϕ, in the sense that if

Then, H is a strict contraction in Zϕ. So, H has one and only one ﬁxed

We have

Let
T0 = sup {s > 0 : ∥uσ(., ψ)∥≤α for σ ∈[0, s]} .

(3.6)
This implies that
∥us(., ψ)∥≤c(t)ε + α −1 < α, for all s ∈[0, T0] .
It follows that T0 cannot be the largest number s > 0 such that ∥uσ(., ψ)∥≤
α, for σ ∈[0, s] . Thus, T0 ≥t and t < Tψ. Furthermore, ∥us(., ψ)∥≤α,
for s ∈[0, t], then using the inequality (3.6) we deduce the dependence
continuous with the initial data. This completes the proof of Theorem
Theorem 13 Assume that F is continuously diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes
the following locally Lipschitz condition: for each α > 0 there exists a
constant C1(α) > 0 such that if ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈CX and ∥ϕ1∥, ∥ϕ2∥≤α then

|DϕF(t, ϕ1) −DϕF(t, ϕ2)| ≤C1(α) ∥ϕ1 −ϕ2∥.
Then, for given ϕ ∈C1

Moreover,

group on a Banach space (X, |·|), (A, D(A)) its generator, B a bounded

Assume that S′(t) : (D(A), |·|) →(D(A), |·|) is compact for each t > 0.
Then, for each t ∈(c, T + c], {Pλ(t), λ ∈Λ} is a precompact subset of
(D(A), |·|).
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of a fundamental result of
Travis and Webb [94]. Let H = {S′(t)x;
t ∈[c, T + c] , x ∈D(A), |x|
≤kN}, where k is the Lipschitz constant of S(·) on [0, T] and N is a
bound of B. Using the same reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 2.5 [94],
one can prove that H is precompact in (D(A), |·|). Hence, the convex
hull of H is precompact. On the other hand, we have, from Lemma 2

Proof. Let {ϕλ, λ ∈Λ} be a bounded subset of E and let t > r. For

Using a result of Kellermann [80], one can prove that the operator 5G
deﬁned in 5CX by

D( 5G) =
D( 5A),
5G
=
5A + 5L,
where 5A is deﬁned in Proposition 49, is the generator of a locally Lip-
schitz continuous integrated semigroup on 5CX, because 5A satisﬁes (HY)
and 5L ∈L(CX, 5CX).
Let us introduce the part G of 5G in CX, which is deﬁned by :

D(G) =

ϕ ∈D( 5G);
5Gϕ ∈CX

G (ϕ) =

It is easy to see that
G = P.
Then, P is the generator of a locally Lipschitz continuous integrated
semigroup (V (t))t≥0 on CX.

neous Cauchy problem

z(0)

(4.6)
where h : [0, +∞[ →5CX is given by
h(t) = ϕ + 5L(V (t)ϕ).
By Theorem 4, the nonhomogeneous Cauchy problem (4.6) has a unique

For each complex number λ, we deﬁne the linear operator

θ ∈[−r, 0] .
We will call λ a characteristic value of Equation (4.4) if there exists
x ∈D(A0)\{0} solving the characteristic equation ∆(λ)x = 0.
The
multiplicity of a characteristic value λ of Equation (4.4) is deﬁned as
dim Ker∆(λ).
We have the following result.
Corollary 18 There exits ω ∈IR, such that for λ > ω and c ∈X, one
has
(λI −5G)−1(X0c) = eλ·∆(λ)−1c.
Proof. We have, for λ > ω0

Then,

Hence the operator ∆(λ) is invertible for λ > ω.
Consider the equation
(λI −5G)(eλ·a) = X0c,
where c ∈X is given and we are looking for a ∈D(A0). This yields

Hence the name of fundamental integral solution.
The fundamental solution Z′(t) is deﬁned only for c ∈D(A0) and is

Principle of linearized stability

rium point of Equation (1.1) in the autonomous case, that is
 du
dt (t) = A0u(t) + F(ut),
t ≥0,
u0 = ϕ.
(5.1)
We make the following hypothesis :
F is continuously diﬀerentiable, F(0) = 0 and F is satisﬁes the Lipschitz
condition
|F(ϕ1) −F(ϕ2)| ≤L ∥ϕ1 −ϕ2∥, for all ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈CX,
where L is a positive constant.
Let T(t) : E →E, for t ≥0, be deﬁned by
T(t)(ϕ) = ut(., ϕ),
where u(., ϕ) is the unique integral solution of Equation (5.1) and
E =

ϕ ∈CX,
ϕ(0) ∈D(A0)

.
We know that the family (T(t))t≥0 is a nonlinear strongly continuous
semigroups of continuous operators on E.
Consider the linearized equation of (5.1) corresponding to the Fr´echet-
derivative DϕF(0) = F ′(0) at 0 :
 du
dt (t) = A0u(t) + F ′(0)ut,
t ≥0,
u0 = ϕ ∈CX,
(5.2)
and let (U′(t))t≥0 be the corresponding linear C0−semigroup on E.
Proposition 52 The Fr´echet-derivative at zero of the nonlinear semi-
group T(t), t ≥0, associated to Equation ( 5.1), is the linear semigroup
U′(t), t ≥0, associated to Equation ( 5.2).
Proof. It suﬃces to show that, for each ε > 0, there exists δ > 0
such that

an equilibrium of (V (t))t≥0 (i.e., V (t)x0 = x0, for all t ≥0). The
equilibrium x0 is called exponentially asymptotically stable if there ex-
ist δ > 0, µ > 0, k ≥1 such that
∥V (t)x −x0∥≤ke−µt ∥x −x0∥for all x ∈W with ∥x −x0∥≤δ and all t ≥0.
We have the following result.
Theorem 23 Suppose that the zero equilibrium of (U′(t))t≥0 is expo-
nentially asymptotically stable, then zero is exponentially asymptotically
stable equilibrium of (T(t))t≥0 .
The proof of this theorem is based on the following result.
Theorem 24 (Desh and Schappacher [65]) Let (V (t))t≥0 be a nonlinear
strongly continuous semigroup of type γ on a subset W of a Banach space
Y , i.e.
∥V (t)x1 −V (t)x2∥≤M′eγt ∥x1 −x2∥, for all x1, x2 ∈W
and assume that x0 ∈W is an equilibrium of (V (t))t≥0 such that V (t)
is Fr´echet-diﬀerentiable at x0 for each t ≥0, with Y (t) the Fr´echet-
derivative at x0 of V (t), t ≥0. Then, (Y (t))t≥0 is a strongly continuous
semigroup of bounded linear operators on Y. If the zero equilibrium of
(Y (t))t≥0 is exponentially asymptotically stable, then x0 is an exponen-
tially asymptotically stable equilibrium of (V (t))t≥0.

In this part, we show in the linear autonomous case (Equation (4.4)),
the existence of a direct sum decomposition of the state space
E =

ϕ ∈CX,
ϕ(0) ∈D(A0)

into three subspaces : stable, unstable and center, which are semigroup
invariants. We assume that the semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 on D(A0) is com-
pact. It follows from the compactness property of the semigroup U′(t),
for t > r, on E, the following results.
Corollary 25 [89] For each t > r, the spectrum σ(U′(t)) is a countable
set and is compact with the only possible accumulation point 0 and if
µ ̸= 0 ∈σ(U′(t)) then µ ∈Pσ(U′(t)), (where Pσ(U′(t)) denotes the
point spectrum).
383

Corollary 26 [89] There exists a real number δ such that ℜeλ ≤δ for
all λ ∈σ(B). Moreover, if β is a given real number then there exists only
a ﬁnite number of λ ∈Pσ(B) such that ℜeλ > β.
We can give now an exponential estimate for the semigroup solution.
Proposition 53 Assume that δ is a real number such that ℜeλ ≤δ for
all characteristic values of Equation ( 4.4). Then, for γ > 0 there exists
a constant k(γ) ≥1 such that
22U′(t)ϕ
22 ≤k(γ)e(δ+γ)t ∥ϕ∥,
for all t ≥0, ϕ ∈E.
Proof. Let ω1 be deﬁned by
ω1 := inf
3
ω ∈lR :
sup


e−ωt 22U′(t)

.
The compactness property of the semigroup (see [84]) implies that
ω1 = s1(B) := sup {ℜeλ :
λ ∈Pσ(B)} .
On the other hand, if λ ∈Pσ(B) then there exists ϕ ̸= 0 ∈D(B) such
that Bϕ = λϕ. This implies that
ϕ(θ) = eλtϕ(0)
and
ϕ′(0) = A0ϕ(0) −L(ϕ) with ϕ(0) ̸= 0.
Then, ∆(λ)ϕ(0) = 0. We deduce that λ is a characteristic value of
Equation (4.4).
We will prove now the existence of λ ∈Pσ(B) such that ℜeλ = s1(B).
Let (λn)n be a sequence in Pσ(B) such that ℜeλn →s1(B) as n →+∞.
Then, there exists β such that ℜeλn > β for n ≥n0 with n0 large
enough. From Corollary 26, we deduce that {λn : ℜeλn > β} is ﬁnite.
So, the sequence (ℜeλn)n is stationary.
Consequently, there exists n
such that ℜeλn = s1(B). This completes the proof of Proposition 53
The asymptotic behavior of solutions can be now completely obtained
by the characteristic equation.
Theorem 27 Let δ be the smallest real number such that if λ is a char-
acteristic value of Equation ( 4.4), then ℜeλ ≤δ. If δ < 0, then for all
ϕ ∈E, ∥U′(t)ϕ∥→0 as t →+∞. If δ = 0 then there exists ϕ ∈E\{0}
such that ∥U′(t)ϕ∥= ∥ϕ∥for all t ≥0. If δ > 0, then there exists ϕ ∈E
such that ∥U′(t)ϕ∥→+∞as t →+∞.
Proof. Assume that δ < 0, then we have ω1 = s1(B) < 0 and the
stability holds. If δ = 0, then there exists x ̸= 0 and a complex λ such
384

Basic theory of abstract DFE with non-dense domain
that ℜeλ = 0 and ∆(λ)x = 0. Then, λ ∈Pσ(B) and eλt ∈Pσ(U′(t)).
Consequently, there exists ϕ ̸= 0 such that
U′(t)ϕ = eλtϕ.
This implies that ∥U′(t)ϕ∥=
22eλtϕ
22 = ∥ϕ∥. Assume now that δ > 0.
Then, there exists x ̸= 0 and a complex λ such that ℜeλ = δ and
∆(λ)x = 0. Then, there exists ϕ ̸= 0 such that ∥U′(t)ϕ∥= eδt ∥ϕ∥→

Using the same argument as in [96], [section 3.3, Theorem 3.1], we
obtain the following result.
Theorem 28 Suppose that X is complex. Then, there exist three linear
subspaces of E denoted by S, US and CN, respectively, such that

Theorem 28 implies that, in the hyperbolic case the center subspace
CN is reduced to zero. Thus, we have the following result.
Corollary 29 If the semigroup (U′(t))t≥0 is hyperbolic, then the space

Proof. Theorem 28 implies that the space US is ﬁnite dimensional

⊆π(B(lR−)). Conversely, let ϕ ∈S and u(., ϕ) be the integral solution
of Equation (4.4) in S, which is bounded on lR−. Assume that there is
a t ∈(−∞, 0] such that ut(., ϕ) ̸= 0. Then, for any s ∈(−∞, t), we have
ut(., ϕ) = U′(t −s)us(., ϕ).
Thanks to Corollary 29 we have
∥ut(., ϕ)∥≤Me−γ(t−s) ∥us(., ϕ)∥,
s ≤t.
Since us(., ϕ) is bounded, we deduce that us(., ϕ) = 0. Therefore,

In the same manner, one can prove the same relations for B(lR+) and
B(lR).
Let f ∈B(lR−) and u = u(., ϕ, f) be a solution of Equation (7.2) in

Let u = u(., ϕUS, f) be deﬁned by (7.7) and let K : B(lR−) →B(lR−)

Therefore, K is a continuous linear operator on B(lR−), Kf satisﬁes

Existence of periodic or almost periodic
solutions
In this section, we are concerned with the existence of periodic (or
almost periodic) solutions of Equations (7.2) and (7.10).
As a consequence of the existence of a bounded solution we obtain
the following result.
Corollary 31 Assume that the semigroup (U′(t))t≥0 is hyperbolic. If
the function f is ω−periodic, then the bounded solution of Equation ( 7.2)
given by Theorem 30 is also ω−periodic.
Proof. Let u be the unique bounded solution of Equation (7.2). The
function u(. + ω) is also a bounded solution of Equation (7.2).
The
uniqueness property implies that u = u(.+ω). This completes the proof
of the corollary
We are concerned now with the existence of almost periodic solution
of Equation (7.2). We ﬁrst recall a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 51 A function g ∈B(lR) is said to be almost periodic if and
only if the set
{gσ : σ ∈lR} ,
where gσ is deﬁned by gσ(t) = g(t + σ), for t ∈lR, is relatively compact
in B(lR).
Theorem 32 Assume that the semigroup (U′(t))t≥0 is hyperbolic.
If
the function f is almost periodic, then the bounded solution of Equation
( 7.2) is also almost periodic.
391

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Proof. Let AP(lR) be the Banach space of almost periodic functions
from lR to X endowed with the uniform norm topology.

operator Q by

for t ∈lR.
Then, Q is a bounded linear operator from AP(lR) into B(lR). By a
sample computation, we obtain
(Qf)σ = Q (fσ) ,
for σ ∈lR.
By the continuity of the operator Q, we deduce that Q({fσ : σ ∈lR})
is relatively compact in B(lR). This implies that if the function f is
almost periodic, then the bounded solution of Equation (7.2) is also
almost periodic. This completes the proof of the theorem.
We are concerned now with the existence of almost periodic solutions
of Equation (7.10). We will assume the followings.
(H2) g is almost periodic in t uniformly in any compact set of CX. This
means that for each ε > 0 and any compact set K of CX there exists
lε > 0 such that every interval of length lε contains a number τ with the
property that
sup
t∈R,ϕ∈K
∥g(t + τ, ϕ) −g(t, ϕ)∥< ε.
We know from [63] that if the function g is almost periodic in t uniformly
in any compact set of CX and if v is an almost periodic function, then
the function t →g(t, vt) is also almost periodic.
(H3) ∥g(t, ϕ1) −g(t, ϕ2)∥≤K1 ∥ϕ1 −ϕ2∥,
t ∈lR, ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈CX.
We have the following result.
Proposition 55 Assume that the semigroup (U′(t))t≥0 is hyperbolic and
(H2), (H3) hold. Then, if in the assumption (H3) K1 is chosen small
enough, Equation ( 7.10) has a unique almost periodic solution.
Proof. Consider the operator H deﬁned on AP(lR) by
Hv = u,
where u is the unique almost periodic solution of Equation (7.2) with
f = g(., v.). We can see that there exists a positive constant K2 such
that
∥Hv1 −Hv2∥≤K1K2 ∥v1 −v2∥,
v1, v2 ∈AP(lR).
392

Basic theory of abstract DFE with non-dense domain
If K1 is chosen such that K1K2 < 1, then the map H is a strict contrac-
tion in AP(lR). So, H has a unique ﬁxed point in AP(lR). This gives an
almost periodic solution of Equation (7.10). This completes the proof of
the proposition

where T, l > 0, ϕ ∈CX := C ([−r, 0] , X) and X = C ([0, l] , IR) .
By setting U(t) = u(t, ·), Equation (9.1) reads

We have D(A0) = {u ∈C([0, l] , IR);
u(0) = 0} ̸= X. Moreover,

the solution u of Equation ( 9.2) is continuously diﬀerentiable on [0, T]×
[0, l] and is equal to the unique solution of Problem ( 9.1).
Proof. One can use Theorem 10 (all the assumptions of this theorem
are satisﬁed).

Using the results of Section 3, we obtain the following theorems (the

Basic theory and some results for examples
Proofs for most of the basic results presented in this part are found in
the monograph [57]. See also [105].
1.1
Semiﬂows of retarded functional diﬀerential
equations
Let h > 0, n ∈N. Let C denote the Banach space C([−h, 0], Rn), with
∥φ∥= max−h≤s≤0 |φ(s)|. The space C will serve as state space. For x :
R ⊃I →Rn and t ∈R with [t −h, t] ⊂I, the segment xt : [−h, 0] →Rn
is the shifted restriction of x to the initial interval [−h, 0],
xt(s) = x(t + s) for s ∈[−h, 0].
Autonomous retarded functional diﬀerential equations on C (RFDEs)
are equations of the form
˙x(t) = f(xt),
for a given map f : C ⊃U →Rn. In the sequel we shall assume that
U ⊂C is open and that f is locally Lipschitz continuous. Some results
require that f is continuously diﬀerentiable. Solutions x : [t0 −h, te) →
Rn, −∞< t0 < te ≤∞, of the previous RFDE are continuous, diﬀer-
entiable on (t0, te), and satisfy the RFDE for t0 < t < te. This implies

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
that their right derivative at t0 exists and equals f(xt0). Solutions on
(−∞, te) (including on R) are diﬀerentiable and satisfy the RFDE every-
where.
A maximal solution xφ : [t0 −h, te(φ)) →Rn of the initial value
problem (IVP)
˙x(t) = f(xt), x0 = φ ∈U,
is a solution of the RFDE which satisﬁes the initial condition and has
the property that any other solution of the same IVP is a restriction of
xφ.
Example. Let µ ∈R and a continuously diﬀerentiable function g :
R →R be given. The equation
˙x(t) = −µ x(t) + g(x(t −1))
(1.1)
is an RFDE, with h = 1, n = 1, and f(φ) = −µ φ(0) + g(φ(−1)) for all
φ ∈C. Solutions are easily found via the method of steps: For φ ∈C
given, evaluate successively the variation-of-constants formulae
x(t) = e−µ(t−n)x(n) +
 t
n
e−µ(t−s)f(x(s −1))ds,
for nonnegative integers n and n ≤t ≤n + 1, with x0 = φ. This yields
the maximal solution xφ : [−1, ∞) →R of the IVP for eq. (1.1). - If
g(0) = 0 then x : R ∋t →0 ∈R is a constant solution (equilibrium
solution). For µ > 0 and
ξ g(ξ) < 0 for all ξ ̸= 0
eq. (1.1) models a combination of delayed negative feedback and in-
stantaneous negative feedback with respect to the zero solution. The
condition
ξ g(ξ) > 0 for all ξ ̸= 0
corresponds to delayed positive (and instantaneous negative) feedback.
In case of negative feedback and µ ≥0, initial data with at most one
zero deﬁne slowly oscillating solutions, which have any two zeros spaced
at a distance larger than the delay h = 1.
How is slowly oscillating behaviour reﬂected in the state space C ? Seg-
ments xt of slowly oscillating solutions belong to the set S ⊂C \ {0} of

initial data with at most one change of sign. More precisely, φ ̸= 0, and
0 ≤φ, or φ ≤0, or there are j ∈{0, 1} and a ∈[−1, 0] so that
0 ≤(−1)jφ(t) on [−1, a], (−1)jφ(t) ≤0 on [a, 0].
The set S is positively invariant, i.e., for all φ ∈S and all t ≥0, xφ
t ∈S.
We have
cl S = S ∪{0},
and
(0, ∞) · S ⊂S
which says that S is a wedge.
It can be shown that S is homotopy
equivalent to the circle; S is not convex. See [240].
Let us call a solution eventually slowly oscillating if for some t its zeros
z ≥t are spaced at distances larger than the delay h = 1. The main
result of [177] establishes that in case µ ≥0, g bounded from below or
from above, and
g′(ξ) < 0 for all ξ ∈R
almost every initial function φ ∈C deﬁnes a solution which is eventually
slowly oscillating.
More precisely, the set R of data whose maximal
413

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
solutions are not eventually slowly oscillating is closed and a graph
T ⊃dom →Q
with respect to a decomposition of C into a closed subspace T of codi-
mension 2 and a 2-dimensional complementary subspace Q. This shows
that the set C \R of initial data of eventually slowly oscillating solutions
is open and dense in C.
Remark. For certain bounded but non-monotone functions g and for
certain µ > 0 there exist rapidly oscillating periodic solutions with at-
tracting orbits [116]. This means that for such g and µ the previous
statement is false.
Problem. Does the density result hold in case µ = 0 for all g which
satisfy the negative feedback condition ?
We shall see that in case of negative feedback slowly oscillating pe-
riodic solutions play a prominent role in the dynamics generated by
eq.(1.1). In a simple case, which was excluded from the considerations
up to here, they are easily found.
Exercises. Deﬁne and compute a ‘slowly oscillating periodic solution’
of eq. (1.1) for µ = 0 and the step function g = −sign. Then com-
pute a slowly oscillating periodic solution for a suitable smooth function
g which is positive and constant on some interval (−∞, −a] and linear
and decreasing on some interval [−b, ∞), 0 < b < a.
In case of positive feedback, the convex cones of nonnegative and non-
positive data are positively invariant. See [137].
Back to the general case. The maximal solutions of the IVP with
t0 = 0 deﬁne a continuous semiﬂow
F : Ω→U,
F(t, φ) = xφ
t
and
Ω= {(t, φ) ∈[0, ∞) × U : t < te(φ)}.
The domain Ωis open in [0, ∞) × U.
Recall the algebraic semiﬂow
properties
F(0, φ) = φ and
414

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
F(t, F(s, φ)) = F(t+s, φ) whenever φ ∈U, 0 ≤s < te(φ), 0 ≤t < te(F(s, φ)).
The solution maps Ft = F(t, ·), t ≥0, are deﬁned on the open sets
Ωt = {φ ∈U : (t, φ) ∈Ω}. For certain t > 0, Ωt may be empty.
Remark. A ﬂow does not exist in general, as there are no backward
solutions for nondiﬀerentiable initial data. Also, initially diﬀerent solu-
tions may become identical on some ray [t, ∞). Therefore solutions of
the backward IVP are in general not uniquely determined.
Example. Eq. (1.1) with g constant on a nontrivial interval I, initial
data φ ̸= ψ with range in I and φ(0) = ψ(0).
Before discussing diﬀerentiability with respect to initial data a look
at nonautonomous linear delay diﬀerential equations is convenient: Let
L : [t0, te) × C →Rn, t0 < te ≤∞, be continuous and assume all maps
L(t, ·) are linear. Solutions of the equation
˙y(t) = L(t, yt)
are deﬁned as before. Maximal solutions exist and are deﬁned on [t0 −
h, te).
Suppose f is continuously diﬀerentiable.
For a given maximal so-
lution x = xφ : [t0 −h, te(φ)) →Rn of an IVP associated with the
nonlinear RFDE above the variational equation along x is the previous
linear equation with
L(t, ψ) = Df(xt)ψ for t0 ≤t < te(φ), ψ ∈C.
Example.
Let g(0) = 0.
The variational equation along the zero
solution of eq. (1.1), or linearization at 0, is
˙v(t) = −µ v(t) + α v(t −1)
(1.2)
with α = g′(0).
In case f is continuously diﬀerentiable all solution operators Ft on non-
empty domains are continuously diﬀerentiable, and for all φ ∈Ωt, χ ∈C,
DFt(φ)χ = vφ,χ
t
with the maximal solution vφ,χ : [−h, te(φ)) →Rn of the IVP
˙v(s) = Df(F(s, φ))vs, v0 = χ.
415

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
On the open subset of Ωgiven by t > h the semiﬂow F is continuously
diﬀerentiable, with
D1F(t, φ)1 = ˙xφ
t .
I.e., for t > h the tangent vectors of the ﬂowline
[0, te(φ)) ∋t →F(t, φ) ∈U
exist and are given by the derivatives of the solution segments. Notice
that for 0 ≤t < h the solution segments are in general only continuous
and not diﬀerentiable.
1.2
Periodic orbits and Poincar´e return maps
Let a periodic solution x : R →Rn of the RFDE be given. Assume f is
continuously diﬀerentiable. Let p > h be a period of x, not necessarily
minimal. A transversal to the periodic orbit
o = {xt : t ∈[0, p]} ⊂U
at x0 = xp is a hyperplane H = x0 + L, with a closed subspace L of
codimension 1, so that
D1F(p, x0)1 /∈L = Tx0H.
Recall that L is the kernel of a continuous linear functional φ∗. The
relation F(t, φ) ∈H is equivalent to the equation
φ∗(F(t, φ) −x0) = 0.
An application of the Implicit Function Theorem close to the solution
(p, x0) yields an open neighbourhood N of x0 in C and a continuously
diﬀerentiable intersection map
τ : N →R
so that τ(x0) = p and
F(τ(φ), φ) ∈H for all φ ∈N.
The Poincar´e return map
P : H ∩N ∋φ →F(τ(φ), φ) ∈H
is continuously diﬀerentiable (with respect to the C1-submanifold struc-
tures on H ∩N and H).
416

Figure 10.3.
The derivatives DP(φ)χ, φ ∈H ∩N and χ ∈TφH = L, are given by
prφ ◦DFτ(φ)(φ)χ
where prφ : C →L is the projection along the (tangent) vector
η = D1F(τ(φ), φ)1 = ˙xφ
τ(φ) /∈L.
We have
prφψ = ψ −φ∗ψ
φ∗η η.

In particular,
DP(x0)χ = prx0DFp(x0)χ.

1.3
Compactness
Often the solution maps Ft, t ≥h, are compact in the sense that they
map bounded sets into sets with compact closure.
(F0 = idU is not
compact, due to dim C = ∞).
Example. Eq. (1.1) with g bounded from above or from below. Com-
pactness follows by means of the Ascoli-Arz`ela Theorem from simple
a-priori bounds on solutions and their derivatives.
Also Poincar´e maps are often compact. It follows that all these maps
are not diﬀeomorphisms. Therefore standard tools of dynamical systems
theory on ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds, which had originally been devel-
opped for diﬀeomorphisms only, e.g., local invariant manifolds, inclina-
tion lemmas, and the shadowing lemma associated with a hyperbolic set,
had to be generalized in a suitable way for diﬀerentiable, not necessarily
invertible maps in Banach spaces.
1.4
Global attractors
Consider a semiﬂow F : [0, ∞) × M →M on a complete metric space
M. A complete ﬂowline is a curve u : R →M so that
F(t, u(s)) = u(t + s) for all t ≥0, s ∈R.
A set I ⊂M is invariant if each x ∈I is a value of a complete ﬂowline
u with u(R) ⊂I. This is equivalent to
Ft(I) = I for all t > 0.
A (compact) global attractor A for F is a compact invariant set A ⊂M
which attracts bounded sets in the sense that for every bounded set
B ⊂M and for every open set V ⊃A there exists t ≥0 such that
F(s, B) ⊂V for all s ≥t.
Exercise. A global attractor contains each bounded set B ⊂M which
satisﬁes B ⊂F(t, B) for all t > 0.
It follows from the exercise that a global attractor A contains every
compact invariant set, and that it is uniquely determined. Furthermore,
A coincides with the set of all values of all bounded complete ﬂowlines.
Existence of global attractors is in some cases easy to verify. Consider
for example eq. (1) with µ > 0 and g : R →R injective and bounded.
418

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
Then all solution maps are injective, and F1 is compact. For r > 1 +
(sup |g|)/µ the open ball Cr in C with radius r > 0 and center 0 is
positively invariant under the semiﬂow and absorbs every ﬂowline in the
sense that for every φ ∈C there exists t ≥0 with F(s, φ) ∈Cr for all
s ≥t. The set
A =
+
t≥0
F(t, Cr)
is the global attractor [137].
1.5
Linear autonomous equations and spectral
decomposition
For L : C →Rn linear continuous, consider the RFDE
˙y(t) = Lyt.
The semiﬂow is now given by the C0-semigroup of solution operators
Tt : C ∋φ →yφ
t ∈C, t ≥0. The domain of its generator G : DG →C is
DG = {φ ∈C : φ continuously diﬀerentiable, ˙φ(0) = Lφ},
and Gφ = ˙φ. The solution behaviour is determined by the spectrum
of the generator. The solution operators are compact for t ≥h, and
the complexiﬁcation of G has compact resolvents. So the spectrum σ
of G consists of a countable number of isolated eigenvalues of ﬁnite
multiplicities, which are real or occur in complex conjugate pairs. The
Ansatz y(t) = eλt c for a solution leads to a characteristic equation for
the eigenvalues. Example: For eq. (1.2),
λ + µ −α e−λ = 0.
An important property is that any halfplane given by an equation
Re λ > β
for β ∈R contains at most a ﬁnite number of eigenvalues.
Examples. For eq. (1.2) with µ = 0, α < −π
2 (negative feedback),
there exist pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues with positive real part,
and there are no real eigenvalues. In case µ > 0 and α > 0 (positive
feedback) the eigenvalue with largest real part is positive and all other
eigenvalues form complex conjugate pairs.
419

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

420

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
Rapid growth of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues as Re λ →−∞
shows that G is not sectorial, and that the semigroup is not analytic.
The realiﬁed generalized eigenspaces associated with a real eigenvalue
or a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues are positively invariant under
the semigroup, as well as generalized eigenspaces C<β associated with
all eigenvalues in a left halfplane given by an equation
Re λ < β,
with β ∈R. On the ﬁnite-dimensional generalized eigenspace C≥β given
by the set σ≥β of all eigenvalues satisfying
Re λ ≥β
the semigroup induces a group of isomorphisms Tt,β = eBt, t ∈R, with a
linear vectorﬁeld B : C≥β →C≥β. The spectrum of B is σ≥β; generalized
eigenspaces of an eigenvalue with respect to G and B coincide. On the
complementary subspace C<β,
∥Ttφ∥≤k eβ t∥φ∥, t ≥0,
with k = k(L, β) ≥0.
The unstable, center, and stable subspaces Cu, Cc, Cs of G are the
realiﬁed generalized eigenspaces given by the sets σ>0, σ0, σ<0 of the
eigenvalues with positive, zero, and negative real part, respectively. Cu
consists of segments of solutions on the line which decay to 0 exponen-
tially as t →−∞and whose segments grow exponentially as t →∞.
Cc consists of segments of solutions with polynomial growth. Solutions
starting in Cs decay exponentially to 0 as t →∞. We have
C = Cu ⊕Cc ⊕Cs.
The semigroup is called hyperbolic is there are no eigenvalues on the
imaginary axis.
Examples of other spectral decompositions of C. Consider eq. (1.2).
In the case µ ≥0 and α < 0 (negative feedback), there is a leading pair of
eigenvalues, i.e., there exists β ∈R so that the sum of the multiplicities
of the eigenvalues with Re λ > β is 2. For convenience we choose β so
that there are no eigenvalues on β + iR. For the leading eigenvalues,
|Im λ| < π,
421

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
and all solutions with segments in the 2-dimensional space
C2 = C>β
are slowly oscillating. Solutions on the line with segments in realiﬁed
generalized eigenspaces associated with other complex conjugate pairs
of eigenvalues are not slowly oscillating.
Later we shall consider the
decomposition
C = C2 ⊕C2<
where C2< = C<β. We have
C2 ⊂S ∪{0}
and
S ∩C2< = ∅.
See [240].
Figure 10.6.
In the result from [177] on density of initial data for eventually slowly
oscillating solutions of the nonlinear eq. (1.2), we actually have T = C2<
and Q = C2, for the space T containing the domain dom of the map rep-
resenting the thin set R of segments of rapidly oscillating solutions and
for the target space Q of this map. Of course, C2< and C2 are here
deﬁned by the variational equation (1.2) along the zero solution of eq.
(1.1).
422

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
In the positive feedback case µ ≥0 and α > 0, with α suﬃciently
large, there are at least 3 eigenvalues in the open right halfplane. Choose
β > 0 so that the 3 eigenvalues with largest real parts satisfy β < Re λ,
and there are no eigenvalues on β + iR. The solutions on the line with
segments in
C3 = C>β
have at most 2 zeros in any interval of length h = 1, and they decay
to 0 as t →−∞faster than t →eβ t.
Later we shall consider the
decomposition
C = C3 ⊕C3<
where C3< = C<β. See [137].
Figure 10.7.
1.6
Local invariant manifolds for nonlinear
RFDEs
Assume f is continuously diﬀerentiable, and f(φ0) = 0. For simplicity,
φ0 = 0. Then the zero function on the line is a solution, and 0 ∈U is
a stationary point of the semiﬂow: F(t, 0) = 0 for all t ≥0. The linear
variational equation along the zero solution is given by
L = Df(0).
There exist open neighbourhoods Nu, Nc, Ns of 0 in the spaces Cu, Cc, Cs,
respectively, and continuously diﬀerentiable maps
wu : Nu →Cc ⊕Cs, wc : Nc →Cu ⊕Cs, ws : Ns →Cu ⊕Cc
with ﬁxed point 0 and zero derivatives at 0 whose graphs
W ∗= {χ + w∗(χ) : χ ∈N∗}
423

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
are locally positively invariant under the semiﬂow F. This means that
there is a neighbourhood N of 0 so that ﬂowlines starting in N ∩W ∗
remain in W ∗as long as they stay in N. The local unstable manifold W u
consists of segments of solutions x : (−∞, te) →Rn which decay to 0 ex-
ponentially as t →−∞. Conversely, all such solutions with all segments
in a neighbourhood of 0 in C have their segments in W u. All bounded
solutions on the line which remain suﬃciently small have all their seg-
ments in W c. All solutions which start in W s decay to 0 exponentially as
t →∞, and the segments of all solutions on [−h, ∞) which remain in a
neighbourhood of 0 and tend to 0 exponentially as t →∞belong to W s.
Figure 10.8.
In case all eigenvalues have negative real part, one obtains the Prin-
ciple of Linearized Stability, i.e., asymptotic stability of the linearized
equation implies the same for the equilibrium of the original nonlinear
equation.
The local unstable and stable manifolds are unique (in a certain sense)
while local center manifolds are not.
It is also possible to begin with a splitting of σ not at β = 0. Con-
sider again eq. (1.1) with µ > 0 and α > 0 suﬃciently large (positive
feedback), so that there are at least 3 eigenvalues in the open right half-
plane. Then there exists a 3-dimensional leading local unstable manifold
W3, i.e., a locally positively invariant C1-submanifold of C with
T0W3 = C3
which consists of segments of solutions on intervals (−∞, 0] which tend
to 0 as t →−∞faster than t →eβ t. See [137].

Remark: If a global attractor exists then local unstable manifolds and
their forward extensions by the semiﬂow belong to the global attractor.
1.7
Floquet multipliers of periodic orbits
Assume f is continuously diﬀerentiable, and let a periodic solution x :
R →Rn and a period p > h of x be given. The associated Floquet mul-
tipliers are the nonzero points in the spectrum (of the complexiﬁcation)
of the monodromy operator
M = D2F(p, x0).
They can be used to describe the behaviour of ﬂowlines close to the
periodic orbit
o = {xt : 0 ≤t ≤p}.
The number 1 is a Floquet multiplier; an eigenvector in C is
˙x0 = ˙xp = D1F(p, x0)1.
The periodic orbit is called hyperbolic if 1 is an eigenvalue with 1-
dimensional generalized eigenspace, and if there are no other Floquet
multipliers on the unit circle. In case of hyperbolicity and if there are
no Floquet multipliers outside the unit circle, the periodic orbit o is ex-
ponentially stable with asymptotic phase, which means in particular that
there are a neighbourhood N ⊂U of o, constants k ≥0, γ > 0, and a
function θ : N →R so that for all φ ∈N and all t ≥0,
∥F(t, φ) −xt+θ(φ)∥≤k e−γ t.
If there are Floquet multipliers outside the unit circle then the periodic
orbit is unstable.
425

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
If P is a Poincar´e return map on a transversal H = x0 +L and if x0 is
a ﬁxed point of P then the spectral properties of DP(x0) : L →L and
those of the monodromy operator are closely related, due to the formula
DP(x0) = prx0 ◦M|L.
The simplest case is that M is compact and hyperbolicity holds. Then
the Floquet multipliers λ ̸= 1 and their multiplicities coincide with the
eigenvalues of DP(x0) and their multiplicities. Without hyperbolicity, 1
becomes an eigenvalue of DP(x0) with a realiﬁed generalized eigenspace
of reduced dimension.
The compactness assumption can be relaxed.
In the most general
case, however, several natural questions concerning monodromy opera-
tors and Poincar´e maps seem not yet discussed in the literature, to the
best of my knowledge.
How can one obtain results about Floquet multipliers ? If µ = 0 and
if g is odd and bounded with |g′(0)| suﬃciently large then eq. (1.1) has
periodic solutions with rational periods [120]. In the negative feedback
case, one ﬁnds, among others, slowly oscillating periodic solutions of
minimal period 4, with the additional symmetry
x(t) = −x(t −2).
It follows that the associated monodromy operator has
V = D2F(2, x0)
as a root; the Floquet multipliers are squares of the eigenvalues of V .
For the latter, a characteristic equation is found in the following way:
Suppose
V φ = λφ, φ ̸= 0.
Then the segments v0, v1, v2 of the solution v = vx0,φ of the variational
equation along x satisfy
˙v2 = g′(x(1 + t))v1, ˙v1 = g′(t)v0
and
v2 = λ v0.
Substitute v0 = λ−1v2 in the last diﬀerential equation. Then (v2, v1)
satisﬁes
˙v2 = g′(x(1 + t))v1, ˙v1 = λ−1g′(x(t))v2
426

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations

and the nonlocal boundary conditions
v2(−1) = v1(0), v1(−1) = (v0(0) =)λ−1v2(0).
Using a fundamental matrix solution of the ODE system one ﬁnds that
a certain determinant, which depends on the parameter λ through the
fundamental matrix solution and through the boundary conditions, must
vanish. This is the desired characteristic equation. Though there is no
explicit formula and the dependence on the underlying periodic solution
x seems rather involved it was possible to make use of the characteristic
equation, ﬁrst in a proof of bifurcation from a continuum of period-4-
solutions of a one-parameter family of delay diﬀerential equations [238],
and later in the search for hyperbolic stable [43] and unstable [115]
period-4-solutions. The latter were used in the ﬁrst proof that chaotic
behaviour of slowly oscillating solution exists for certain smooth nonlin-
earities g of negative feedback type [153, 154]. See also [59, 60].
In recent work, more general characteristic equations for periodic so-
lutions with arbitrary rational periods were developped. A ﬁrst appli-
cation was to show that for certain µ > 0 and special nonlinearities g
of negative feedback type the orbits of some slowly oscillating periodic
solutions with minimal period 3 are hyperbolic and stable [211]. It is
planned to extend the method in order to establish that certain unsta-
ble rapidly oscillating periodic solutions of eq. (1.1) with µ > 0 and g
representing positive feedback are hyperbolic; the period in this case is
5/4.
In cases where period and delay are incommensurable characteristic
equations for Floquet multipliers seem unknown.
427

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Local invariant manifolds of continuously differentiable
maps in Banach spaces
We also need local invariant manifolds for continuously diﬀerentiable
maps f : E ⊃U →E on open subsets of Banach spaces (over R).
Suppose for simplicity that f(0) = 0, and that the (compact) spectrum
of the derivative Df(0) is the disjoint union of its compact parts outside,
on, and inside the unit circle. Then E is the direct sum of the associated
realiﬁed generalized eigenspaces Eu, Ec, Es, i.e., of the unstable, center,
and stable linear spaces, respectively. Assume
dim Eu < ∞, dim Ec < ∞.
The derivative Df(0) induces isomorphisms of the unstable and center
spaces and an endomorphism of the stable space. With respect to an
equivalent norm on E the isomorphism on the unstable space is an ex-
pansion and the map on the stable space is a contraction. There are
open neighbourhoods Nu, Nc, Ns of 0 in Eu, Ec, Es, respectively, and
continuously diﬀerentiable maps
wu : Nu →Ec ⊕Es, wc : Nc →Eu ⊕Es, ws : Ns →Eu ⊕Ec,
with w∗(0) = 0 and Dw∗(0) = 0, so that the local unstable, center, and
stable manifolds
W∗= {x + w∗(x) : x ∈N∗}
are locally positively invariant with respect to f and have further prop-
erties analogous to the locally invariant manifolds for the semiﬂow in-
troduced above.
Figure 10.11.
428

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
For example, Wu consists of endpoints of trajectories (xj)0
−∞of f which
tend to 0 as j →−∞, and there exist k ≥0 and q ∈(0, 1) so that
∥xj∥≤k q−j∥x0∥
along all such trajectories. Conversely, any trajectory (xj)0
−∞in some
neighbourhood of 0 in E which for j →−∞converges to 0 at a certain
rate belongs to Wu.
Using the equivalent norm one can construct Wu and Ws in such a way
that f induces a diﬀeomorphism from a convex open neighbourhood of
0 in Wu onto Wu and maps Ws into Ws. With respect to the new norm
the inverse diﬀeomorphism and the map induced on Ws are contractions.
See [103] for local unstable and stable manifolds, and compare the
results in the appendices in [137].
The latter contain a proof of the
following natural result on local center-stable manifolds, which to my
knowledge and surprise was not available elsewhere in the literature.
Theorem. There exist convex open bounded neighbourhoods Nsc of 0
in Ec ⊕Es, Nu of 0 in Eu, N of 0 in U, and a continuously diﬀerentiable
map wsc : Nsc →Eu with wsc(0) = 0, Dwsc(0) = 0, and wsc(Nsc) ⊂Nu
so that the set
Wsc = {z + wsc(z) : z ∈Nsc}
satisﬁes
f(Wsc ∩N) ⊂Wsc
and
∞
+
n=0
f−n(Nsc + Nu) ⊂Wsc.
The proof employs a method due to Vanderbauwhede and van Gils
[231].
The ﬁxed point 0 - and the linear map Df(0) - are called hyperbolic
if there is no spectrum on the unit circle. Then Ec = {0}.
In case of a semiﬂow F as before and a stationary point, say φ0 = 0
for simplicity, we have local invariant manifolds for the solution maps Ft
at the ﬁxed point 0 as well as for the semiﬂow.
Exercise. Show that local unstable and stable manifolds of solution
operators coincide with local unstable and stable manifolds for the semi-

ﬂow, respectively.
The situation for center manifolds is more subtle. There exist center
manifolds Wc for solution maps which are not locally positively invariant
under the semiﬂow [133].
Hyperbolic sets, shadowing, and chaotic trajectories of
continuously differentiable maps in Banach spaces
Let E denote a real Banach space. Consider an open set U ⊂E and a
continuously diﬀerentiable map f : U →E. A hyperbolic set H of f is
a positively invariant subset of U together with a uniformly continuous
and bounded projection-valued map pr : H →Lc(E, E) and constants
k ≥1, q ∈(0, 1) so that the unstable spaces Ex
u = pr(x) and the stable
spaces Ex
s = (id −pr)(x), x ∈H have the following properties:
Df(x)Ex
s ⊂Ef(x)
s
,
E = Df(x)Ex
u + Ef(x)
s
,
∥pr(fn(x)) ◦Dfn(x)v∥≥k−1q−n∥v∥for all n ∈N, v ∈Ex
u,
∥Dfn(x)v∥≤k qn∥v∥for all n ∈N, v ∈Ex
s .
Figure 10.12.
See [219, 220] and [149]. So the derivative maps stable spaces into stable
spaces, but not necessarily unstable spaces into unstable spaces. Con-
cerning subsequent unstable spaces it is only required that the projec-
tions of transported vectors grow, not the iterated vectors themselves.
This is weaker than in the classical deﬁnition for diﬀeomorphisms in
ﬁnite-dimensional spaces, and can be veriﬁed for certain Poincar´e re-
turn maps which do not have hyperbolic sets in the classical sense.
The triple (pr, k, q) is called hyperbolic structure.
430

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
For our hyperbolic sets the Shadowing Lemma remains valid in full
generality. It asserts that under a weak additional smoothness condition
on the map f, for a given hyperbolic set H and for every suﬃciently
small ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 so that each δ-pseudotrajectory (yn)∞
−∞in
H,
∥yn+1 −f(yn)∥< δ for all integers,
is accompanied by a unique trajectory (wn)∞
−∞of f,
∥wn −yn∥≤ϵ for all integers.
See [219, 149]. The shadowing trajectory does in general not belong to
H.
Figure 10.13.
Very roughly, the Shadowing Lemma makes it possible to establish com-
plicated trajectory behaviour by prescribing complicated pseudotrajec-
tories, provided the hyperbolic set H is rich enough for this.
A fundamental scenario going back to Poincar´e (1899, in the diﬀeo-
morphism case) for which one can ﬁnd a hyperbolic structure is the
following. Suppose f has a hyperbolic ﬁxed point p with local unstable
manifold Wu and local stable manifold Ws, and there is a homoclinic
trajectory (xn)∞
−∞, i.e.,
xn →p as |n| →∞,
x0 ̸= p. Assume also the transversality condition that there exists n0 ∈N
so that for all integers m < −n0 and n > n0, we have xm ∈Wu, xn ∈Ws,
and
Dfn−m(xm)TxmWu is a closed complement of TxmWs.

Figure 10.14.
Under these conditions the homoclinic loop
HL = {p} ∪{xn : n ∈Z}
is a hyperbolic set [220].
By the way, it is not excluded that eventually xn = p. This occurs,
e.g., for chaotic interval maps.
Figure 10.15.
By means of shadowing one can then prove that chaotic trajectories
close to the homoclinic loop HL exist. The precise statement of the
result requires preparations, including elementary facts from symbolic
dynamics. Let J ∈N. Consider the space of symbols ΣJ = {1, . . . , J}
with the discrete topology. The product space
SJ = (ΣJ)Z
432

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
of bi-inﬁnite sequences in the symbol space is compact, and the Bernoulli
shift σJ : SJ →SJ given by
σJ((an)n∈Z) = (an+1)n∈Z
is a homeomorphism with dense trajectories and inﬁnitely many periodic
orbits. This is a prototype of chaotic behaviour.
Let M ∈N be given and consider the compact subset SJM ⊂SJ
which consists of all symbol sequences composed of pieces of at least M
consecutive symbols 0, alternating with pieces of the form 12 . . . J. On
SJM, the Bernoulli shift induces a homeomorphism which still has dense
trajectories and inﬁnitely many periodic orbits.
As f may not be invertible, it can not be expected that on given
subsets V ⊂U the map f itself is conjugate to the homeomorphism σJM.
This diﬃculty is circumvented by the following construction. Consider
the set TfV of complete trajectories (wn)n∈Z ∈V Z of f in a given open
subset V ⊂U, equipped with the product topology from V Z. TfV is a
closed subset of V Z. The shift induced by f on its bi-inﬁnite trajectories
in V , i.e., the map
σfV : TfV ∋(wn)n∈Z →(wn+1)n∈Z ∈TfV
is a homeomorphism.
Theorem [220]. There exist positive integers J and M ≥2 and mutu-
ally disjoint open subsets V0, . . . , VJ of U with the following properties:
p ∈V0, HL ⊂EJ
0 Vj = V , and for every (wn)n∈Z ∈TfV ,
wn ∈V0 and wn+1 /∈V0 imply wn+1 ∈V1,
wn ∈Vj and j ∈{1, . . . , J −1} imply wn+1 ∈Vj+1,
wn ∈VJ implies wn+µ ∈V0 for all µ ∈{1, . . . , M}.
The map α : TfV →SJM given by
α((wn)n∈Z) = (an)n∈Z, an = j if and only if wn ∈Vj,
is a homeomorphism which conjugates the shifts σfV and σJM:
α ◦σfV = σJM ◦α.

Diﬀerential equations with state-dependent
delays
Modelling sometimes leads to equations of the form
˙x(t) = g(x(t −r(xt)))
with a map g : Rn ⊃dom →Rn and a delay functional r which is deﬁned
on some set of functions φ : [−h, 0] →Rn and has values in [0, h], for
some h > 0. Of course, more complicated versions occur also. E.g., the
right hand side may also depend on x(t) and on further delayed values
of x. - Let us see why the associated IVP does not ﬁt into the framework
presented before.
The diﬀerential equation with state-dependent delay rewritten as a
RFDE is
˙x(t) = f(xt)
with
f = g ◦ev ◦(id × (−r)),
where
r : U →[0, h]
is assumed to be deﬁned on a subset U ⊂C, and
ev : C × [−h, 0] →Rn
is the evaluation map given by
ev(φ, s) = φ(s).
The problem is that such f in general does not satisfy the previous
smoothness hypotheses, no matter how smooth g and r are. A ’reason’
for this may be seen in the fact that the middle composite ev is not
smooth: Lipschitz continuity of ev would imply Lipschitz continuity of
elements φ ∈C. Diﬀerentiability would imply that
D2ev(φ, s)1 = ˙φ
exists.
Therefore the existence and smoothness results designed for IVPs of
RFDEs on C are not applicable. If C is replaced with the smaller Banach
space C1 = C1([−h, 0], Rn) of continuously diﬀerentiable functions φ :
[−h, 0] →Rn, with the usual norm given by
∥φ∥1 = ∥φ∥+ ∥˙φ∥,
435

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
then the smoothness problem disappears since the restricted evaluation
map
Ev : C1 × [−h, 0] →Rn
is continuously diﬀerentiable, with
D1Ev(φ, s)χ = Ev(χ, s)
and
D2Ev(φ, s)1 = ˙φ(s).
So, for g and r : U →[0, h], U ⊂C1 open, both continuously diﬀeren-
tiable, the resulting map f : U →Rn is continuously diﬀerentiable.
However, if we now look for solutions of the IVP with initial values
in the open subset U ⊂C1, a new diﬃculty arises. Suppose this IVP
is well-posed. The maximal solution xφ : [−h, te(φ)) →Rn would have
continuously diﬀerentiable segments. Hence xφ itself would be continu-
ously diﬀerentiable, and the ﬂowline [0, te(φ)) ∋t →xφ
t ∈C1 would be
continuous. At t = 0 we get
˙φ(0) = ˙x(0) = f(x0) = f(φ),
which in general is not satisﬁed on open subsets of the space C1. (Notice
however that for f = p, p : C1 ∋φ →˙φ(0) ∈Rn the equation is trivially
satisﬁed on C1.)
In order to obtain a continuous semiﬂow - and diﬀerentiable solution
operators - for a reasonable class of RFDEs covering diﬀerential equa-
tions with state-dependent delays, it seems necessary to restrict the state
space further [247, 249]. What to do and what can be achieved will be
the topic of the last of these lectures.

Monotone feedback: The structure of
invariant sets and attractors
Consider eq. (1.1),
˙x(t) = −µx(t) + g(x(t −1)),
with µ ≥0 and with a continuously diﬀerentiable function g : R →R
which satisﬁes
g(0) = 0,
and either
g′(ξ) < 0 for all ξ ∈R
(negative feedback) or
g′(ξ) > 0 for all ξ ∈R
436

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
(positive feedback). The strict monotonicity properties are essential for
all results explained in this part. Assume also that g is bounded from
below or from above. Equations of this type arise in various applica-
tions, e.g., in neural network theory.
2.1
Negative feedback
Recall the positively invariant wedge
S = S ∪{0} ⊂C
of data with at most one change of sign, which contains all segments
of slowly oscillating solutions and absorbs the ﬂowlines of eventually
slowly oscillating solutions. Recall also that S contains the 2-dimensional
leading realiﬁed generalized eigenspace C2 of the linearization at 0, while
S ∩C2< = ∅.
Soon we shall use the decomposition
C = C2 ⊕C2<
as a co-ordinate system.
The semiﬂow F : [0, ∞) × C →C induces a continuous semiﬂow FS
on the complete metric space S, which has a compact global attractor
AS ⊂S. A compact global attractor A of F exists as well; in general, AS
is a proper subset of A. It may happen that AS = {0}. Example: µ = 0
and −1 < g′. If however µ ≥0 and −g′(0) is suﬃciently large then the
leading pair of eigenvalues is in the open right halfplane, and there exists
a leading 2-dimensional local unstable manifold W2 of the nonlinear eq.
(1.1) which is tangent to C2 at 0. W2 consists of segments of bounded
slowly oscillating solutions on the line, and is therefore contained in AS.
In the nontrivial case AS ̸= {0} the attractor AS has the following
properties [240, 250]. There exists a map
a : C2 ⊃DS →C2<
so that
AS = {φ + a(φ) : φ ∈DS}.
437

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
DS ⊂C2 is an open subset of C2 containing 0, and its boundary in
C2 is the trace of a simple closed continuously diﬀerentiable curve; the
closure DS is homeomorphic to the compact unit disk in the Euclidean
plane. The map a : DS →C2< is continuously diﬀerentiable. I.e., the
restriction to the interior is continuously diﬀerentiable, and each bound-
ary point has an open neighbourhood N in C2 so that the restriction
to N ∩int DS extends to a continuously diﬀerentiable map on N. The
manifold boundary
bd AS = AS \ {φ + a(φ) : φ ∈DS} = {φ + a(φ) : φ ∈∂DS}
of AS is the orbit of a slowly oscillating periodic solution. The semiﬂow
FS induces a ﬂow on AS, with solution maps continuously diﬀerentiable
on the interior part
{φ + a(φ) : φ ∈DS}
of AS. All ﬂowlines of the ﬂow except the trivial one are given by slowly
oscillating solutions on the line. The periodic orbits are nested, with
the stationary point 0 in the interior of each periodic orbit. The zeros
of the underlying periodic solutions are simple, and the minimal periods
are given by 3 successive zeros. The aperiodic orbits in AS \ {0} wind
around the stationary point 0 and are heteroclinic from one periodic
orbit to another, or are heteroclinic from 0 to a periodic orbit, or vice
versa.
Figure 10.17.
A tiny but basic ingredient of the proof is the following consideration.
The fact that AS is a graph with respect the decomposition of C above
means that the spectral projection p2 : C →C2 along C2< is injective on
AS. I.e., one needs
0 ̸= p2(φ −ψ) for φ ̸= ψ in AS.
438

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
As S does not intersect the nullspace C2< of p2, it is suﬃcient to have
AS −AS ⊂S ∪{0} = S.
The result in [177] yields that all ﬂowlines of F starting in the open
dense set C \ R converge to the disk AS as t →∞.
In [239] explicit conditions on µ and g are given so that the manifold
boundary is the only periodic orbit in AS, and
AS = A.
Graph representations of stable manifolds associated with periodic orbits
in AS have been obtained in [241].
2.2
Positive feedback
Let us describe in greater detail the results obtained in [137, 136, 242].
A ﬁrst remark is that all solution maps Ft are injective. The semiﬂow
is monotone with respect to the ordering on C given by the cone K of
nonnegative initial data. The positively invariant set
Σ = {φ ∈C : (xφ)−1(0) is unbounded}
separates the domain of absorption into the interior of the positively
invariant cone K from the domain of absorption into the interior of −K.
One of the ﬁrst results in [137] is that the separatrix Σ is a Lipschitz
graph over a closed hyperplane in C. So, we can speak of the parts of
C above and below Σ.
Figure 10.18.
It is not diﬃcult to show that in case µ > 0 and g bounded the
semiﬂow has a global attractor. However, in case µ = 0 every maximal
439

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
solution which starts in in the interior of K ∪(−K) is unbounded, and
thus a global attractor does not exist. So it is natural to look for sub-
stitutes of a global attractor which are present in all cases of interest.
These are the closure of the unstable set W U of all segments of solutions
on the line which decay to the stationary point 0 as t →−∞, and sub-
sets thereof.
Notice that in case a global attractor A exists, necessarily W U ⊂A
since for every ball B and for every t ≥0, W U ⊂F([t, ∞) × (W U ∩B)),
which implies that W U is contained in every neighbourhood of the com-
pact set A, yielding W U ⊂A = A and W U ⊂A.
If µ and g′(0) are such that only one eigenvalue of the generator of
the semigroup given by the variational equation along the zero solu-
tion has positive real part, and all other eigenvalues have negative real
part, then W U consists of 0 and of the segments of two solutions on the
line, one being positive and one negative. More structure appears when
the 3 leading eigenvalues have positive real part. This situation can be
characterized by an explicit inequality which involves µ, g′(0), and ele-
mentary functions only. Assume that this inequality holds. Consider
the decomposition
C = C3 ⊕C3<
and the associated leading 3-dimensional local unstable manifold W3 at
0. W3 is tangent to C3 at 0 and contained in W U. The forward extension
W = F([0, ∞) × W3)
of W3 is an invariant subset of W U. What can be said about the struc-
ture of the closed invariant set W?
In case µ > 0 two mild additional assumptions are needed. They are
related to the fact that the hypothesis about the eigenvalues implies
g′(0) > µ.
The ﬁrst additional assumption is
g(ξ)
ξ
< µ for ξ outside a bounded neighbourhood of 0.
This statement and the inequality before combined show that there exist
a smallest positive argument ξ+ where g and µ id intersect, and a largest
negative argument ξ−where g and µ id intersect. The second additional
assumption then is
g′(ξ−) < µ and g′(ξ+) < µ.
440

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
It follows that the variational equations along the constant solutions
given by ξ−, ξ+ deﬁne hyperbolic semigroups, with all associated eigen-
values in the open left halfplane.
Figure 10.19.
About the shape of W and the dynamics in W the following has been
proved. The set W is invariant, and the semiﬂow deﬁnes a continuous
ﬂow FW : R × W →W. For W and for the part W ∩Σ of the separatrix
Σ in W there are graph representations: There exist subspaces G2 ⊂G3
of C of dimensions 2 and 3, respectively, a complementary space G1
of G2 in G3, a closed complementary space E of G3 in C, a compact
set DΣ ⊂G2 and a closed set DW ⊂G3, and continuous mappings
w : DW →E and wΣ : DΣ →G1 ⊕E such that
W = {χ + w(χ) : χ ∈DW }, W ∩Σ = {χ + wΣ(χ) : χ ∈DΣ}.
Also,
DW = ∂DW ∪int DW , W = {χ + w(χ) : χ ∈int DW },
and the restriction of w to int DW is continuously diﬀerentiable. The
restriction of FW to R × W is continuously diﬀerentiable. The domain
DΣ is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk in the Euclidean plane, and
consists of the trace of a simple closed continuously diﬀerentiable curve
and its interior. The map wΣ is continuously diﬀerentiable (in the sense
explained above for the map a).
The set
o = (W ∩Σ) \ (W ∩Σ) = {χ + wΣ(χ) : χ ∈∂DΣ}
is a periodic orbit, and there is no other periodic orbit in W. The open
annulus (W ∩Σ) \ {0} consists of heteroclinic connections from 0 to o.
441

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
For every φ ∈W, FW (t, φ) →0 as t →−∞.
The further properties of W and the ﬂow FW are diﬀerent in the cases
µ > 0 and µ = 0.
For µ > 0, W is compact and contains the stationary points ξ−and
ξ+ in C given by the values ξ−and ξ+, respectively. For every φ ∈W,
ξ−≤φ ≤ξ+.
There exist homeomorphisms from W and from DW onto the closed unit
ball in R3, which send the manifold boundary
bd W = W \ W = {χ + w(χ) : χ ∈∂DW }
and ∂DW onto the unit sphere S2 ⊂R3. Consider χ−and χ+ given by
ξ−= χ−+ w(χ−) and ξ+ = χ+ + w(χ+). The set ∂DW \ {χ−, χ+} is
a 2-dimensional continuously diﬀerentiable submanifold of G3, and the
restriction of w to DW \ {χ−, χ+} is continuously diﬀerentiable. This
means that the restriction to int DW is continuously diﬀerentiable, and
that each boundary point except χ−, χ+ has an open neighbourhood
N in G3 so that the restriction of w to N ∩int DW extends to a con-
tinuously diﬀerentiable map on N. The points φ ∈W \ Σ above the
separatrix Σ form a connected set and satisfy FW (t, φ) →ξ+ as t →∞,
and all φ ∈W \ Σ below the separatrix Σ form a connected set and
satisfy FW (t, φ) →ξ−as t →∞. Finally, for every φ ∈bd W diﬀerent
from ξ−and ξ+, FW (t, φ) →o as t →−∞.
Combining some of the results stated above, one obtains for µ > 0
the following picture: W is a smooth solid spindle which is split by an
invariant disk in Σ into the basins of attraction towards the tips ξ−and
ξ+.
Figure 10.20.
442

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
In case µ = 0 the sets W and DW are unbounded. There exist home-
omorphisms from W and from DW onto the solid cylinder {z ∈R3 : z2
1 +
z2
2 ≤1} which send bd W and ∂DW onto the cylinder S1 × R ⊂R3. The
boundary ∂DW is a 2-dimensional continuously diﬀerentiable submani-
fold of G3, and w is continuously diﬀerentiable. The points φ ∈W \ Σ
above the separatrix Σ form a connected set and satisfy xφ(t) →∞as
t →∞, and the points φ ∈W \Σ below Σ form a connected set and sat-
isfy xφ(t) →−∞as t →∞. Finally, for every φ ∈bd W, FW (t, φ) →o
as t →−∞.
Figure 10.21.
We turn to aspects of the proof. The ﬁrst steps exploit the monotonic-
ity of the semiﬂow. Among others we obtain that in case µ > 0 the set
W is contained in the order interval between the stationary points ξ−
and ξ+, and that there are heteroclinic connections from 0 to ξ−and ξ+,
given by monotone solutions x : R →R.
A powerful tool for the investigation of ﬁner structures is a version
of the discrete Lyapunov functional V : C \ {0} →N0 ∪{∞} counting
sign changes of data φ ∈C, which was introduced by Mallet-Paret [171].
Related are a-priori estimates for the growth and decay of solutions with
segments in level sets and sublevel sets of V , which go back to [171] and
in a special case to [236, 237].
These tools are used to characterize
443

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
the invariant sets W \ {0} and (W ∩Σ) \ {0} as the sets of segments
xt of solutions x : R →R which decay to 0 as t →−∞and satisfy
V (xt) ≤2 for all t ∈R and V (xt) = 2 for all t ∈R, respectively.
Moreover, nontrivial diﬀerences of segments in W and W ∩Σ belong to
V −1({0, 2}) and V −1(2), respectively. The last facts make it possible to
introduce global coordinates on W and W ∩Σ. It is not diﬃcult to show
injectivity for the continuous linear evaluation map
Π2 : C ∋φ →(φ(0), φ(−1))tr ∈R2
on W ∩Σ, and injectivity on W for a continuous linear evaluation map
Π3 : C →R3. The map Π3 is given by
Π3φ = (φ(0), φ(−1), c(φ))tr
and
(p1φ)(t) =
1
1 + g′(0)e−λ c(φ)eλ t,
where p1 is the spectral projection onto the realiﬁed one-dimensional
generalized eigenspace C1 of the leading eigenvalue λ associated with
the linearization at 0. The inverse maps of the restrictions of Π2 and Π3
to W ∩Σ and W, respectively, turn out to be locally Lipschitz continuous.
The next step leads to the desired graph representation. Guided by
the results on negative feedback equations it seems natural to expect that
there exists a map from a subset of C3 = T0W3 into C3< which represents
W, and a map from a subset of the realiﬁed 2-dimensional generalized
eigenspace L of the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues next to λ into
the complementary space C1 ⊕C3< which represents W ∩Σ. A map of
the ﬁrst kind had been constructed for W by Ammar in case µ = 0 [11].
Our attempts to obtain the second map failed, however. Therefore we
abandoned the decomposition
C = C3 ⊕C3<, C3 = C1 ⊕L
as a framework for graph representations.
Instead, R3 ⊃Π3W and
R2 ⊃Π2(W ∩Σ) are embedded in a simple way as subspaces G3 ⊃G2
into C, so that representations by maps w and wΣ with domains in G3
and G2 and ranges in complements E of G3 in C and E ⊕G1 of G2
in C, G1 ⊂G3, become obvious. It is not hard to deduce that W is
given by the restriction of w to an open set, and that this restriction
is continuously diﬀerentiable.
On W, the semiﬂow extends to a ﬂow
FW : R × W →W, and FW is continuously diﬀerentiable on the mani-
fold R × W.
444

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
Phase plane techniques apply to the coordinate curves in R2 (or G2)
which correspond to ﬂowlines of FW in the invariant set W ∩Σ, and
yield the periodic orbit
o = (W ∩Σ) \ (W ∩Σ),
as well as the identiﬁcation of Π2(W ∩Σ) with the interior of the trace
Π2o. It follows that W ∩Σ is given by the restriction of wΣ to an open
subset of G2.
The investigation of the smoothness of the part W ∩Σ of the separa-
trix Σ in W and of the manifold boundary bd W = W \W begins with a
study of the stability of the periodic orbit o. We use the fact that there
is a heteroclinic ﬂowline in W ∩Σ from the stationary point 0 to the
orbit o, i.e., in the level set V −1(2), in order to show that precisely one
Floquet multiplier lies outside the unit circle. It also follows that the
center space of the monodromy operator M = D2F(ω, p0), p0 ∈o and
ω > 0 the minimal period, is at most 2-dimensional. The study of the
linearized stability of the periodic orbit o is closely related to earlier work
in [153] and to a-priori results on Floquet multipliers and eigenspaces
for general monotone cyclic feedback systems with delay which are due
to Mallet-Paret and Sell [176].
A ﬁrst idea how to show that the graph W ∩Σ ⊂V −1(2)∪{0} is con-
tinuously diﬀerentiable might be to consider the family of 2-dimensional
local invariant submanifolds with tangent space L at the stationary point
0 ∈C, and to look for a member formed by heteroclinics connecting 0
with the periodic orbit o. The approach in [137] is quite diﬀerent. We
consider a transversal Y of o at some point p0 ∈o and a Poincar´e return
map with domain in Y and ﬁxed point p0. It is shown that pieces of
W ∩Σ in Y are open sets in the transversal intersection of W with a
local center-stable manifold of the Poincar´e return map.
Figure 10.22.
Then we use the ﬂow FW to obtain continuous diﬀerentiability of the
set (W ∩Σ) \ {0}. Diﬀerentiability and continuity of the derivative at 0
445

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
and the relation
T0(W ∩Σ) = L
follow by other arguments which involve a-priori estimates and an incli-
nation lemma.
A technical detail of the approach just described concerns center-
stable manifolds Wcs and one-dimensional center manifolds Wc at ﬁxed
points of continuously diﬀerentiable maps. In case there is a forward
trajectory in Wcs \ Wc which converges to the ﬁxed point we construct
positively invariant open subsets of Wcs.
Figure 10.23.
Having established continuous diﬀerentiability of W ∩Σ it is then
shown in case µ > 0 that the set bd W \ {ξ−, ξ+}, i.e., the manifold
boundary without the stationary points ξ−, ξ+, coincides with the for-
ward semiﬂow extension of a local unstable manifold of the period map
Fω at a ﬁxed point p0 ∈o. For µ = 0 the full manifold boundary has
the same property. The long proof of these facts involves the charts Π2
and Π3 and uses most of the results obtained before.
The next step achieves the continuous diﬀerentiability of a piece of W
in a transversal H of the periodic orbit o. We construct a continuously
diﬀerentiable graph over an open set in a plane X12 ⊂H which extends
such a piece of W ∩H close to a point p0 ∈o ∩H beyond the boundary.
Using the ﬂow FW we then derive that W \ {ξ−, ξ+} and W ∩Σ are
continuously diﬀerentiable, in the sense stated before.
The ﬁnal steps lead to the topological description of W. In case µ > 0
the identiﬁcation of bd W \ {ξ−, ξ+} as forward extension of a local un-

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
stable manifold is used to deﬁne homeomorphisms from bd W onto the
unit sphere S2 ⊂R3.
Then a generalization due to Bing [29] of the
Schoenﬂiess theorem [210] from planar topology is employed to obtain
homeomorphisms from W onto the closed unit ball in R3. The applica-
tion of Bing’s theorem requires to identify the bounded component of
the complement of the set
Π3(bd W) ∼= S2
in R3 as the set Π3W, and to verify that Π3W is uniformly locally 1-
connected. This means that for every ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 so that
every closed curve in a subset of Π3W with diameter less than δ can
be continuously deformed to a point in a subset of Π3W with diameter
less than ϵ. We point out that the proof of this topological property
relies on the smoothness of the set W \ {ξ−, ξ+}, and involves subsets
of boundaries of neighbourhoods of 0, ξ−, ξ+ in W which are transver-
sal to the ﬂow FW . In order to construct these smooth boundaries we
have to go back to the variation-of-constants formula for RFDEs in the
framework of sun-dual and sun-star dual semigroups [57]. In case µ = 0
the construction of the desired homeomorphism from W onto the solid
cylinder is diﬀerent but uses Bing’s theorem as well.
What can be said about W close to the attracting stationary points
ξ−, ξ+? Consider ξ+. The inclusion
W ⊂ξ+ −K
implies that the tangent cone T0W is the singleton {0}; therefore W and
bd W are not smooth at ξ+.
Let C1+ denote the leading realiﬁed one-dimensional generalized
eigenspace associated with the variational equation along the solution
R ∋t →ξ+ ∈R. Analogously L+ is the realiﬁed 2-dimensional gener-
alized eigenspace of the next pair of eigenvalues, and C3<+ is given by
the remaining eigenvalues. We have
C1+ = R · η+
with η+ ∈C a segment of the associated positive decreasing exponential
solution of the variational equation.
In [242] the singularity ξ+ is described in terms of the outward tangent
cone T+bd W, deﬁned as the set of tangent vectors c′(0) ∈C of continu-
ously diﬀerentiable curves c : (−ϵ, 0] →C, ϵ > 0, in bd W ending at ξ+,
448

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
and in terms of the set LTP of limit points of tangent planes Tφbd W,
φ ̸= ξ+, as φ tends to ξ+. We prove
T+bd W = [0, ∞) · η+
and show that LTP coincides with the set of planes in C1+ ⊕L+ con-
taining C1+.
Figure 10.26.
Convergence of ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of C is here deﬁned by
the gap topology, which is given by the Hausdorﬀdistance of the com-
pact intersections of two such spaces with the unit sphere. The proofs
employ a-priori estimates and inclination lemmas.
For narrower classes of nonlinearities g and for the parameters µ > 0
and g′(0) > 0 in a certain smaller range than before, the periodic orbit
o is the only one of the semiﬂow, and the set W is in fact the global
attractor of F [136]. The ﬁrst and basic ingredient of the proof is the
uniqueness result. The equations covered include examples from neural
network theory.
Let us state some open problems.
Recall the question whether W ∩Σ can be represented by a smooth
map from a subset of L into the complementary space C1 ⊕C3<.
One may ask for diﬀeomorphisms instead of homeomorphisms from
DW onto the solid cylinder in case µ = 0, and from DW \{χ−, χ+}
onto the unit ball without its north and south poles in case µ > 0.
The assumption g′(ξ−) < µ, g′(ξ+) < µ, which makes the semi-
groups associated with the stationary points ξ−, ξ+ hyperbolic,
might be relaxed.

How is the global attractor organized in case W is a proper subset?
We add a few remarks about the last question. Let us ﬁrst consider sit-
uations where A is a subset of the order interval {φ ∈C : ξ−≤φ ≤ξ+}.
The segments of the solutions x : R →R with V (xt) = 2 for all t ∈R
may form, together with the stationary point 0, a smooth disk-like sub-
manifold A2 in A which extends W ∩Σ beyond o and contains at least
one additional periodic orbit, forming the manifold boundary of A2.
In this case, the unstable sets of the periodic orbits in A2 should be
analogues of bd W \ {ξ−, ξ+}, namely 2-dimensional invariant submani-
folds given by heteroclinic connections from the periodic orbit to ξ−and
ξ+. These submanifolds should subdivide the 3-dimensional subset A≤2
of A formed by 0 and the segments of all solutions x : R →R with
ξ−≤x(t) ≤ξ+ and V (xt) ≤2 for all t ∈R into invariant layers; a
section of A≤2 containing ξ−and ξ+ might have the structure shown by
a sliced onion.
Figure 10.27.
It may be the case that A = A≤2. If A is strictly larger than A≤2 then
we have to expect a ﬁnite number of analogues of the smooth disk A2,
given by higher even values of V , and a more complicated variety of
heteroclinic connections, between periodic orbits in the same disk, be-
tween periodic orbits in diﬀerent disks, from periodic orbits and 0 to ξ−
and ξ+, from 0 to periodic orbits and to ξ−and ξ+. Also connections
from periodic orbits to 0 become possible. A Morse decomposition of A
similar to the one constructed by Mallet-Paret [171] should be useful to
describe a part of these heteroclinic connections.
Suppose now that A is not conﬁned to the order interval {φ ∈C : ξ−≤
φ ≤ξ+}, and there are zeros ξ∗of g −µ id below ξ−and above ξ+ with
450

g′(ξ∗) > µ. One out of many possibilities is that the part of A in a certain
neighbourhood of a stationary point ξ∗∈C given by such a value ξ∗looks
just as we began to sketch it for the case A ⊂{φ ∈C : ξ−≤φ ≤ξ+}.

Chaotic motion
This part describes steps of the proof in [153, 154], which yields existence
of chaotic solution behaviour for eq. (1.1) with µ = 0,
˙x(t) = g(x(t −1)),
for functions g which satisfy the negative feedback condition. The result
in [154] was not the ﬁrst one about existence of chaotic solutions of delay
diﬀerential equations, but the ﬁrst concerning slowly oscillating solutions
of equations with smooth nonlinearities. The nonlinearities considered
have extrema. Recall that monotonicity implies that the attractor AS of
almost all solutions is a disk, which excludes complicated behaviour of
slowly oscillating solutions.
Nevertheless the proof begins with odd functions g which satisfy
g′(ξ) < 0 for all ξ ∈R. For a function of this type there is a slowly
oscillating periodic solution y : R →R with the symmetry
y(t) = −y(t −2)
and minimal period 4, whose orbit o ⊂C is unstable and hyperbolic,
with exactly one Floquet multiplier λ outside the unit circle [115]. This
multiplier is real and simple. It follows that the period map F4 has one-
dimensional local center and unstable manifolds at its ﬁxed point y0 = η.
We may assume y(−1) = 0 < ˙y(−1). The linear hyperplane
H = {φ ∈C : φ(−1) = 0}
451

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
is transversal to o at η. For an associated Poincar´e return map the ﬁxed
point η is hyperbolic with one-dimensional local unstable manifold Wu
and local stable manifold Ws of codimension 1 in H. Recall the abstract
result for maps in Banach spaces which guarantees chaotic trajectories in
a neighbourhood of a homoclinic loop. The plan is to verify the hypothe-
ses of this result for a modiﬁcation of the map P, whose trajectories all
translate into slowly oscillating solutions of a delay diﬀerential equation
as before, with a nonlinearity g∗of negative feedback type which coin-
cides with g in a neighbourhood of the interval y(R). The ﬁrst major
step is to ﬁnd such functions g∗so that there is a solution z : R →R
which is homoclinic with respect to o, i.e.,with
zt →o as |t| →∞, z0 /∈o.
This is done as follows.
y is increasing on the initial interval, and
y(0) = ∥η∥= max y.
Information about the eigenspace of the Floquet multiplier λ reveals
that Wu contains the segment z0 of a solution z : R →R of the original
equation with
z(0) > y(0)
so that for some ϵ > 0 and δ > 0,
z(t) > y(0) + ϵ on (−δ, 0], z(t) < y(0) + ϵ on (−∞, −δ).
The key to all is now a simple observation: Any modiﬁcation g∗of g
in the interval (y(0) + ϵ, ∞) preserves y and the restriction of z to the
interval
(−∞, −δ + 1]
as solutions, but aﬀects the forward continuation of z|(−∞, −δ + 1] as a
solution z∗: R →R of the new equation. Modiﬁcations g∗are designed
in such a way that the curves t →z∗
t intersect the hyperplane H close to
η at some t∗> −δ +1. These modiﬁcations look rather complicated and
have several extrema: 3 local maxima and 4 local minima. Intersections
can be achieved above and below the local stable manifold Ws, in a
carefully chosen convex open neighbourhood N ⊂H of η on which the
original map P is also a Poincar´e return map with respect to the modiﬁed
delay diﬀerential equation, and
P(N ∩Ws) ⊂N ∩Ws.
452

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
Figure 10.29.
Two such modiﬁcations g∗are connected by a one-parameter-family.
Continuity yields a member so that the intersection of the curve t →z∗
t
with H is on Ws, and the desired nonlinearity and homoclinic solution
are found.
Figure 10.30.
Now the map P is modiﬁed. The neighbourhood N has the prop-
erty that it contains a backward trajectory (z∗
tj)0
−∞∈Wu of P so that
P(z∗
t0) /∈N; z∗(t) = z(t) on (−∞, t0]. Choose a small closed ball B∗⊂N
centered at z∗
t0 = zt0 = ζ, with z∗
tj /∈B∗for j < 0 and so that one has an
intersection map on B∗which has the value t∗−t0 at ζ. Redeﬁne P on
int B∗using the previous intersection map, and keep P on N \ B∗un-

changed. Then the ﬁxed point η and the points z∗
tj, j ≤0, z∗
t∗, P j(z∗
t∗),
j ∈N, form a homoclinic loop of the new map P ∗.
Figure 10.31.
The previous construction is in fact carried out for families of one-
parameter-families of nonlinearities. This freedom is needed for the re-
maining part of the proof, which is to verify the transversality condition,
namely, that there exists n0 ∈N so that for all integers m < −n0 and
n > n0, the points φm and φn of the homoclinic trajectory of P ∗belong
to Wu and Ws, respectively, with
D(P ∗)n−m(φm)TφmWu ⊕TφmWs = H.
In our situation, codim Ws = 1.
In order to verify the direct sum
decomposition of H we therefore need a suitable criterion for a vector
in H not to be tangent to the local stable manifold Ws.
’Suitable’
means that the criterion should be suﬃciently explicit in terms of the
nonlinearity g∗and the periodic solution y so that it can actually be
applied. The ﬁrst step towards the transversality criterion concerns the
variational equation along y,
˙v(t) = g′(y(t −1))v(t −1)
and the monodromy operator M = DF4(η), η = y0. The monotonicity
of g on the range of y implies that the set S of data with at most
one change of sign is again positively invariant, and that solutions v :
[−1, ∞) →R starting in S are eventually slowly oscillating. The realiﬁed
generalized eigenspace C≥of the 2 leading Floquet multipliers on and
454

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
outside the unit circle is contained in S; dim C≥= 2. Let Z denote
the complementary subspace given by the remaining spectrum of M,
i.e., the linear stable space of M. Recall that the local stable manifold
Ws(η) of the period map F4 at η satisﬁes
TηWs(η) = Z.
Initial data in Z deﬁne solutions v : [−1, ∞) →R with segments in C\S.
So,
Z ∩S = ∅,
and if a solution v is eventually slowly oscillating then χ = v0 ∈C \ Z;
in other words, the initial value is transversal to Z. Here we have a ﬁrst
suﬃcient condition for transversality, but not yet for the right map and
only at a particular point of the local stable manifold. In a next step it
is shown that for any φ ∈Ws(η) and χ ∈C,
χ ∈C \ TφWs(η) if and only if vφ,χ is eventually slowly oscillating.
With regard to the proof, notice that for φ close to η the spaces TφWs(η)
and Z are close. Flowlines starting in Ws(η) converge to o as t →∞
with asymptotic phase. This yields that the coeﬃcient function in the
variational equation along xφ : [−1, ∞) →R, which is satisﬁed by vφ,χ,
approaches a shifted copy of the coeﬃcient function in the variational
equation along the periodic solution y. - The main tool used in the proof
is an inclination lemma in a non-hyperbolic situation.
The ﬁnal form of the criterion, for the Poincar´e map P, is that for
any φ ∈Ws and any χ ∈H,
χ ∈H \ TφWs
if and only if
for every pair of reals (a, b) ̸= (0, 0), the function
(0, ∞) ∋t →a ˙xφ(t) + b vφ,χ(t) ∈R is eventually slowly oscillating.
Notice that for t > 1 the function considered here satisﬁes the variational
equation along the solution xφ : [−1, ∞) →R. - The proof exploits the
relation between derivatives of the Poincar´e map and the period map,
and the asymptotic phase for ﬂowlines starting in Ws.
The last part of the proof that chaotic motion exists is the search for
a subclass of nonlinearities g∗so that for all nonzero
χ ∈D(P ∗)n(ζ)TζWu
455

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
and for all suﬃciently large integers n the suﬃcient condition in the pre-
vious ’transversality-by-oscillation’ criterion is fulﬁlled.
The nonlinearities for which the proof just described works look much
more complicated than the unimodal functions in versions of eq. (1.1)
with µ > 0 which are known from applications. A reason for this is that
g∗was chosen in such a way that the curve t →z∗
t through a point in Wu
close to η is driven far away from o and then returns to Ws within a short
interval of length approximately 3. In a more recent paper Lani-Wayda
was able to modify the method and obtain a result for nicer-looking uni-
modal nonlinearities [150].
Let us mention some open problems.
It has not yet been proved that the Mackey-Glass and Lasota-
Wazewska-Czyzewska equations generate chaotic ﬂowlines. These
are equations of the form (1.1) with µ > 0 and unimodal analytic
nonlinearities.
The result presented here establishes chaotic dynamics only in a
small, thin set in state space, in a ’Cantor dust’, whereas numeri-
cal experiments indicate that many if not almost all solutions are
complicated for a variety of nonlinearities.
Other recent results on chaotic solutions of delay diﬀerential equations
are due to Lani-Wayda [151] and Lani-Wayda and Szrednicki [152].
4.
Stable periodic orbits
In many cases the dynamics of nonlinear autonomous delay diﬀerential
equations is structured by periodic orbits. Existence of periodic orbits
has been shown by several methods, notably by means of the ejective
ﬁxed point principle, by Schauder’s theorem directly, by related index
and continuation arguments, and by more geometric arguments (planar
dynamics in the attractor of almost all solutions, Poincar´e-Bendixson
theorems). Much less could be achieved concerning stability and unique-
ness of periodic orbits.
Consider eq. (1.1),
˙x(t) = −µ x(t) + g(x(t −1)),
for µ ≥0 and nonlinearities g : R →R of negative feedback type which
are continuous or better. As in part 1, the method of steps yields max-
imal solutions x : [−1, ∞) →R of the associated IVP and a continuous
456

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
semiﬂow F.
Recall that, in some contrast to the preceding remarks, there are
special equations for which it is extremely easy to ﬁnd slowly oscillating
periodic solutions whose orbits in C seem very stable and attractive.
The underlying observation for this is the following. If g is constant
on some ray [β, ∞), β > 0 and if initial data φj ∈C, j = 1, 2, with
φj(t) ≥β coincide at t = 0 then the method of steps shows immediately
that the corresponding solutions coincide on [0, 1], and consequently for
all t ≥0. They depend only on the values g(β) and φ(0). It is then easy
to design nonlinearities g as above so that all segments xt of solutions
x = xφ starting at φ ≥β with φ(0) = β return after some time p > 0,
i.e., xp ≥β and x(p) = β. The segment xp is a ﬁxed point of the solution
map Fp and deﬁnes a periodic solution which has period p and is slowly
oscillating.
Figure 10.32.
Moreover, for every ψ ∈C close to φ = xp the solution xψ has segments
which after some time merge into the periodic orbit
o = {xt : t ∈R}.
457

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
This expresses extremely strong attraction towards the periodic orbit.
Poincar´e return maps on transversals to o are locally constant, the deriv-
ative at the ﬁxed point on o is zero, its spectrum is the singleton {0}
and the periodic orbit is hyperbolic.
What has just been said is strictly limited to equations where the non-
linearity g is constant on some interval. What happens if g is only close
to such a function but not constant on any nontrivial interval? The ap-
proach sketched above fails. The general results on existence mentioned
at the beginning may give existence, but nothing beyond. In the sequel
a rather elementary method from [243] is presented which in a sense ﬁlls
the gap between the easily accessible, detailed results in special cases
as before, and the little information for nonlinearities which are close
to these but not necessarily constant on any interval. The important
property is Lipschitz continuity, which in earlier work on eq. (1.1) has
not been exploited. (In case of related equations with state-dependent
delay, however, Lipschitz continuity always played a role.).
Fix µ > 0, b > a > 0. For β > 0 and ϵ > 0 consider nonlinearities in
the set N(β, ϵ) of continuous odd functions g : R →[−b, b] which satisfy
−a −ϵ < g(ξ) < −a + ϵ for all ξ ≥β.
For β and ϵ small, g ∈N(β, ϵ) is steep on (0, β), and close to −a sign on
[β, ∞).
When convenient the associated semiﬂow will be denoted by Fg.
Initial data will be taken from the closed convex sets
A(β) = {φ ∈C : φ(t) ≥β on [−1, 0], φ(0) = β}.
On A(β) a return map can be found for β and ϵ suﬃciently small.
Proposition. There exists w ∈(0, 1) such that for β, ϵ small and for
g ∈N(β, ϵ), φ ∈A(β) the solution xφ,g = xφ of eq. (1) is strictly below
−β on [w, w + 1]. Furthermore, there exists q = qg(φ) > w + 1 so that
xφ,g increases on (w + 1, q) and reaches the level −β at t = q.
The proof relies on the fact that on [β, ∞) and on (−∞, β] the func-
tion g is close to −a sign and a sign, respectively. Using this and the
variation-of-constants formula one sees that on (0, 1] solutions starting
in A(β) lie in a narrow tongue between 2 decreasing exponentials. The
method of steps yields sharp estimates of the solutions also on the next
intervals of unit length. Moreover, derivatives can be estimated with

suﬃcient accuracy.
The return map R = Rg : A(β) →A(β) is then given by
R(φ) = −Fg(qg(φ), φ).
Notice that g being odd any ﬁxed point φ of Rg deﬁnes a slowly oscil-
lating periodic solution x : R →R of eq. (1) with the symmetry
x(t) = −x(t + qg(φ)) for all t ∈R,
and minimal period p = 2q. Fixed points exist, due to Schauder’s the-
orem. However, our objective is more than mere existence. Notice that
up to here only continuity of the nonlinearities in eq. (1) has been used.
The next objective is to ﬁnd an upper estimate of the Lipschitz constant
L(R) = sup
φ̸=ψ
∥R(φ) −R(ψ)∥
∥φ −ψ∥
≤∞
of R. This is facilitated by a decomposition of R = Rg into the restriction
of Fg,1 to A(β), followed by the restriction of Fg,w to Fg,1(A(β)), and
ﬁnally followed by the map
Fg,1+w(A(β)) ∋ψ →−Fg(sg(ψ), ψ) ∈A(β)
where s = sg(ψ) is deﬁned by the equation
w + 1 + s = qg(φ)
for all
φ ∈A(β)
with
ψ = Fg,1+w(φ).
(Observe that for all φ ∈A(β) whose solutions coincide on [w, w +1] the
argument qg(φ) is the same - it depends only on the behaviour of the
solutions on [w, w + 1].)
The Lipschitz constant L(Rg) will be estimated by an expression
which involves the Lipschitz constant L(g) of g and the Lipschitz con-
stant
Lβ(g) = L(g|[β, ∞)).
Notice that for each g ∈N(β, ϵ), L(g) ≥a−ϵ
β
is large for β > 0 small.
On the other hand, each N(β, ϵ) contains Lipschitz continuous functions
g so that Lβ(g) is arbitrarily small. This will be exploited later.
We derive Lipschitz estimates of the composites of the return map Rg
for g ∈N(β, ϵ), with β and ϵ suﬃciently small.
460

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
Proposition. L(Fg,1|A(β)) ≤Lβ(g).
The proof is almost obvious from the facts that for φ, ψ in A(β) the
variation-of-constants formula says
Fg,1(φ)(t) −Fg,1(ψ)(t) = xφ,g(1 + t) −xψ,g(1 + t)
= 0 −0 +
 1+t
0
e−µ(1+t−s)(g(φ(s −1)) −g(ψ(s −1)))ds,
and that the arguments of g belong to [β, ∞). In the same way one ﬁnds
the next result.
Proposition. L(Fg,w|Fg,1(A(β))) ≤1 + w L(g).
The diﬀerence to the previous proposition is due to the fact that
arguments of Fg,w may diﬀer at t = 0, and traverse the interval [−β, β]
where g is steep. One time unit later large deviations of one solution
from another become possible.
Next we need an estimate of the Lipschitz constant of the intersection
map sg.
Proposition.
L(sg) ≤1 + eµ Lβ(g)
a −ϵ −β µ eµ
The proof begins with the fact that for ψ = Fg,w+1(φ) with φ ∈A(β)
there is an equation deﬁning qg(φ) and sg(ψ),
β = xφ,g(qg(φ)) = xφ,g(1 + w + sg(ψ)).
The last term is evaluated by the variation-of-constants formula on
[1 + w, 1 + w + sg(ψ)]. The resulting equation for sg(ψ) and for some
sg(ψ), ψ = Fg,1+w(φ), φ ∈A(β), are subtracted from each other. Further
elementary manipulations lead to the desired estimate.
Proposition.
L(Fg(sg(·), ·)|Fg,1+w(A(β))) ≤
L(sg) · [µ (1 −a
µ (1 −e−µ)) + max{b, a + ϵ}] + 1 + Lβ(g).
The proof uses the triangle inequality, the preceding proposition, and
arguments as in the proof of the estimate of L(Fg,w|Fg,1(A(β)).
461

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Notice that L(Fg(sg(·), ·)| . . .) is bounded in terms of Lβ(g) and con-
stants for β, ϵ small. So this term does not become large for suitable
g ∈N(β, ϵ).
The resulting estimate for the Lipschitz constant of the return map is
L(Rg) ≤Lβ(g) (1 + w L(g)) L(Fg(sg(·), ·)|Fg,1+w(A(β))).
A consequence is that there exist g ∈N(β, ϵ) so that Rg is a contraction.
Examples are found as follows. First ﬁx β and ϵ so that the smallness
hypothesis for the previous estimate of L(Rg) holds for all g ∈N(β, ϵ).
Then choose a Lipschitz continuous odd function g : [−β, β] →[−b, b]
which satisﬁes −a −ϵ < g(β) < −a + ϵ. Continue this function to an
odd map on R with values in (−a −ϵ, −a + ϵ) on (β, ∞) and Lβ(g) so
small that the bound for L(Rg) is less than 1.
Remarks. The small constant Lβ(g) compensates diverging solution
behaviour allowed by the factor 1 + w L(g), on the way of ﬂowlines back
to −A(β). The nonlinearities g for which Rg is a contraction are not
necessarily constant on any interval, not necessarily monotone, may not
have limits at inﬁnity, and may not be diﬀerentiable everywhere. The
negative feedback condition may be violated in (−β, β). The orbits of
the periodic solutions obtained from the ﬁxed points of the contracting
return maps attract all ﬂowlines starting in A(β); one can show that in
case g is continuously diﬀerentiable the periodic orbits are hyperbolic
and stable.
A disadvantage of the previous Lipschitz estimate of L(Rg) is that it
is not easy to verify for given analytic nonlinearities, which are steep
close to 0 and ﬂat away from 0, and which arise in applications, like,
e.g., the function
g = −tanh(γ·), γ > 0 large,
used in neural network theory. In [244] the approach described above
is reﬁned for nonlinearities g ∈N(β, ϵ) which are monotone close to
0. This involves sharp estimates of the divergent behaviour of ﬂowlines
one time unit after the underlying solutions traverse the interval [−β, β]
where g is monotone and steep. The improved Lipschitz estimates yield
contracting return maps (and hyperbolic stable periodic orbits) for the
scaled hyperbolic tangens above, for
g = −arctan(γ·), γ > 0 large,
and for other nonlinearities.
462

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
The sharpened estimates are obtained as follows. Let g ∈N(β, ϵ) be
given. The tongue containing xφ,g, φ ∈A(β), on [0, 1] is formed by the
solutions y> = y>,β,ϵ and y< = y<,β,ϵ of the IVPs
˙y = −µ y −a ± ϵ, y(0) = β.
Deﬁne w = w(β, ϵ) to be the argument where y> reaches the level y =
−β. For β not too large,
0 < w < 1.
Obviously,
xφ,g(t) ≤−β on [w, 1].
Let z< = z<,β,ϵ and z> = z>,β,ϵ denote the zeros of y< and y>, respec-
tively, and let
β−= β−,β,ϵ = y<(w) < −β.
Figure 10.35.
For β and ϵ small and g ∈N(β, ϵ) consider the return map Rg : A(β) →
A(β) and decompose it as before. The objective is to ﬁnd a better esti-
mate for the middle composite Fg,w|Fg,1(A(β)). Recall that a Lipschitz
continuous function g ∈N(β, ϵ) is almost everywhere diﬀerentiable. We
need the hypothesis that there is a set D ⊂R whose complement has
Lebesgue measure 0, with
g′(ξ) < 0 on D ∩(β−, β),
g′ decreasing on D ∩(β−, 0) and increasing on D ∩(0, β).

Remark.
The factors following L(g) replace the constant w in the
former estimate of L(Fg,w)|...). Notice that they vanish for ϵ = 0 ! This
indicates that L(Fg,w|...) may not be too large even if L(g) is large, for
β and ϵ small.
The proof of the proposition begins with the extension of g′ to a
function on (β−, β) which is decreasing on (β−, 0) and increasing on
(0, β).

Remark. It can be shown that the Lipschitz estimate of the proposi-
tion is optimal in the limit (β, ϵ) →(0, 0).
Continuing as in [243] one ﬁnds that for (β, ϵ) small and g ∈N(β, ϵ),
L(Rg) ≤Lβ(g) [4 + L(g) β ϵ 3µ
a2 ]
·[ 1 + eµ Lβ(g)
a −ϵ −µ β eµ · [µ (1 −a
µ (1 −e−µ)) + max{b, a + ϵ}] + 1 + Lβ(g)].
The middle factor comes from the estimate of the middle composite
Fg,w|.... Recall that for suitable g ∈N(β, ϵ), Lβ(g) is small.
How can one verify for given nonlinearities g that the upper bound
for L(Rg) is less than 1?
Let µ > 0 and an odd bounded Lipschitz
continuous function g : R →R be given so that g′ is negative and
increasing on the complement of a set of measure 0 in [0, ∞). Then g
has a limit −a ≤0 at +∞. Suppose a > 0, and consider the family of
functions
gγ = g(γ·), γ > 0.
Figure 10.38.
How can β = β(γ) and ϵ = ϵ(γ) be chosen so that gγ ∈N(β, ϵ) and
L(Rgγ) < 1, at least for large γ? We have Lβ(gγ) = γ Lγβ(g).
Proposition. Suppose there exists a function
β∗: (0, ∞) →(0, ∞)
so that for γ →∞,
β∗(γ) →0,
466

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
γ β∗(γ) →∞,
γ Lγβ∗(γ)(g) →0,
γ Lγβ∗(γ)(g) γ β∗(γ) [a + g(γ β∗(γ))] →0.
Then there exists γ∗> 0 so that for all γ > γ∗, Rgγ is a contraction.
In order to prove this one sets b = 2a. For every γ > 0, β > 0, and
ϵ = a + g(γ β), we have
gγ ∈N(β, ϵ).
The function gγ is Lipschitz continuous and satisﬁes the monotonicity
hypothesis required for the last proposition. Then the estimate of L(Rgγ)
has to be used.
Examples. Consider µ > 0 and g as before. Suppose in addition that
for some r > 3
2,
D ∩(0, ∞) ∋ξ →|ξrg′(ξ)|
is bounded.
Choose s ∈(−1, 0) with
1
1+s < r and 1 +
1
2+2s < r. Then the map
β∗: γ →γs
satisﬁes the hypotheses of the last proposition.
Special cases are given by g = −tanh, g = −arctan.
Remarks. A somewhat stronger result for one-parameter-families of
nonlinearities gγ which are at least continuously diﬀerentiable was ob-
tained earlier by Xie [255]. He proved that for γ large the orbits of given
periodic solutions are hyperbolic and stable. The proof is a study of
the leading Floquet multipliers and relies on very careful a-priori esti-
mates of periodic solutions. The hypotheses needed in [255] are that the
smooth function g has limits at inﬁnity, that g′ is Lebesgue integrable,
and that ξ g′(ξ) →0 as |ξ| →∞. I.e., no monotonicity properties of g′
are required, and the behaviour of g′ at inﬁnity is less restricted than in
the examples mentioned above.
In the approach described here the condition that the nonlinearities g
are odd is not essential. Variants of the method have also been applied
to systems of delay diﬀerential equations [246, 96] and to an equation
with state-dependent delay [245]. For the latter, no other method to
obtain stable periodic motion seems presently available.

State-dependent delays
Diﬀerential equations with state-dependent delay can often be written
in the form
˙x(t) = f(xt)
(5.1)
with a continuously diﬀerentiable map f : C1 ⊃U →Rn, U open. The
associated IVP is not well-posed on U, however. Continuous ﬂowlines
may in general only be expected for data in the subset
X = Xf = {φ ∈U : ˙φ(0) = f(φ)} ⊂C1.
Notice that X is a nonlinear version of the positively invariant domain
{φ ∈C1 : ˙φ(0) = Lφ}
of the generator G of the semigroup deﬁned by the linear autonomous
RFDE
˙y(t) = Lyt
on the larger space C, for L : C →Rn linear continuous. Notice also
that in case of a locally Lipschitz continuous map f∗: U∗→Rn, U∗⊂C
open, all solutions x : [−h, b) →Rn, h < b, of the RFDE
˙x(t) = f∗(xt)
satisfy
xt ∈Xf∗= {φ ∈U∗∩C1 : ˙φ(0) = f∗(φ)} for h ≤t < b.
I.e., the set Xf∗absorbs all ﬂowlines on intervals [−h, b) which are long
enough. In particular, Xf∗contains all segments of solutions on intervals
(−∞, b), b ≤∞- equilibria, periodic orbits, local unstable manifolds,
and the global attractor if the latter is present.
In order to have a semiﬂow on X with diﬀerentiability properties we
need that X is smooth. This requires an additional condition on f.
Proposition. Suppose X ̸= ∅and
(P1)
each derivative Df(φ), φ ∈U, has a continuous linear extension
Def(φ) : C →Rn.
Then X is a continuously diﬀerentiable submanifold of C1 with codi-
mension n.
468

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
The proof is easy. Consider the continuous linear map
p : C1 ∋φ →˙φ(0) ∈Rn.
Then
X = (p −f)−1(0).
It is enough to show that all derivatives D(p −f)(φ), φ ∈X, are surjec-
tive.
Proof of this for n = 1: By (P1), for some δ > 0,
Def(φ)Cδ ⊂(−1, 1).
There exists χ ∈C1 ∩Cδ with ˙χ(0) = 1. Hence
0 < ˙χ(0) −Df(φ)χ = D(p −f)(φ)χ,
R ⊂D(p −f)(φ)C1.
(The Implicit Function Theorem then yields that close to φ the set X is
given by a map from a subset of the nullspace N of D(p −f)(φ) into a
complement of N in C1.)
A solution of eq. (5.1) is deﬁned to be a continuously diﬀerentiable
map x : [t0 −h, te) →Rn, with t0 ∈R and t0 < te ≤∞, so that for
t0 ≤t < te, xt ∈U, and eq. (5.1) is satisﬁed. We also consider solutions
on unbounded intervals (−∞, te). Maximal solutions of IVPs are deﬁned
as in part I.
Theorem. Suppose (P1) holds, X ̸= ∅, and
(P2)
for each φ ∈U there exist a neighbourhood V (in C1) and L ≥0
so that
|f(ψ) −f(χ)| ≤L∥ψ −χ∥for all ψ ∈V, χ ∈V.
Then the maximal solutions xφ : [−h, te(φ)) →Rn of eq. (5.1) which
start at points φ ∈X deﬁne a continuous semiﬂow

t ∈X, Ω=

are continuously diﬀerentiable. For all φ ∈X, t ∈[0, te(φ)), and χ ∈

Comments.
Notice that the Lipschitz estimate in (P2) involves the smaller
norm ∥· ∥≤∥· ∥1 on the larger space C ⊃C1. Property (P2)
was used in [245] in a proof that for certain diﬀerential equations
with state-dependent delay stable periodic orbits exist. It is closely
related to the earlier idea of being locally almost Lipschitzian in
work of Mallet-Paret, Nussbaum, and Paraskevopoulos [175].
Property (P1) is a special case of a condition used in Krisztin’s
work on smooth unstable manifolds [132]. Almost the same prop-
erty occurred earlier [175], under the name almost Frechet diﬀer-
entiability.
Louihi, Hbid, and Arino [164] identiﬁed the set X as the domain
of a generator in the context of nonlinear semigroup theory, for
a class of diﬀerential equations with state-dependent delay. It is
mentioned in [164] that X is a Lipschitz manifold.
In [139] a
complete metric space analogous to X serves as a state space for
neutral functional diﬀerential equations.
Former results about solutions close to an equilibrium, like the
principle of linearized stability for diﬀerential equations with state-
dependent delay due to Cooke and Huang [48], or results on local
unstable manifolds [131, 132], had to be proven without knowledge
of linearizations at the equilibrium.
The diﬃculty was circum-
vented by means of an associated linear autonomous RFDE (a) on
the large space C. Eq. (a) is obtained heuristically, for certain
classes of diﬀerential equations with state-dependent delay: First
the delays are frozen at the given equilibrium φ, then the resulting
RFDE with constant delays is linearized. Examples show how eq.
(a) is related to the actual variational equation
˙v(t) = Df(φ)vt
for data in TφX ⊂C1: Eq. (a) is simply
˙v(t) = Def(φ)vt.
470

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
Also, for the semigroup (T(t))t≥0 on C associated with the last
RFDE and for its generator G,
TφX = dom(G)
and
DFt(φ)χ = T(t)χ
on
TφX.
The theorem yields continuously diﬀerentiable local invariant man-
ifolds
Wu, Wc, Ws
of the solution maps Ft at ﬁxed points; in particular, at stationary
points φ of the semiﬂow. In the last case the tangent spaces of
the local invariant manifolds at φ are the unstable, center, and
restricted stable spaces
Cu, Cc,
and
Cs ∩TφX
of the generator G, respectively. At a stationary point φ the local
unstable and stable manifolds Wu, Ws coincide with local unstable
and stable manifolds W u, W s of the semiﬂow F. An analogous
result for - suitable - center manifolds seems unknown.
Local unstable manifolds at stationary points of diﬀerential equa-
tions with state-dependent delay were found earlier by H. Krishnan
[131] and T. Krisztin [132], under the hypothesis that the associ-
ated linear autonomous RFDE (a) is hyperbolic. Hyperbolicity is
also necessary for a recent result of Arino and Sanchez [16] which
captures saddle point behaviour of solutions close to equilibrium
for a class of diﬀerential equations with state-dependent delay.
The essential part of the proof of our theorem is to solve the equation
x(t) = φ(0) +
 t
0
f(xs)ds, 0 ≤t ≤T,
x0 = φ ∈X,
by a continuously diﬀerentiable map
x : [−h, T] →Rn,
for φ ∈X given; x should also be continuously diﬀerentiable with respect
to φ. Is the Contraction Mapping Principle with parameters applicable?
How does the operator given by the ﬁxed point equation depend on φ?
We ﬁrst rewrite the ﬁxed point equation so that the dependence of the
471

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
integral on φ becomes explicit. For φ ∈C1 let ˆφ denote the continuously
diﬀerentiable extension to [−h, T] given by
ˆφ(t) = φ(0) + ˙φ(0)t on [0, T].
Set u = x −ˆφ. Then u belongs to the Banach space C1
0T of continuously
diﬀerentiable maps y : [−h, T] →Rn with
y(t) = 0 on [−h, 0];
the norm on C1
0T is given by
∥y∥C1
0T =

−h≤t≤T | ˙y(t)|.
u and ˆφ satisfy
u(t) + ˆφ(t) = φ(0) +
 t

f(us + ˆφs)ds
and
ˆφ(t) = φ(0) + ˙φ(0)t = φ(0) + t f(φ)
(since φ ∈X)

 t

f(φ)ds.
For u ∈C1
0T this yields the ﬁxed point equation
u(t) =
 t
0
(f(us + ˆφs) −f(φ))ds, 0 ≤t ≤T,
with parameter φ ∈X.
Now let some φ0 ∈X be given. For φ ∈X close to φ0, u ∈C1
0T small,
and 0 ≤t ≤T with T > 0 small, deﬁne
A(φ, u)(t)
by the right hand side of the last equation. The property (P2) is used to
show that the maps A(φ, ·) are contractions with respect to the norm on
C1
0T , with a contraction factor independent of φ: Let v = A(φ, u), v =
A(φ, u). For 0 ≤t ≤T,
|˙v(t) −˙v(t)| = |f(ut + ˆφt) −f(ut + ˆφt)| ≤L∥ut −ut∥
(due to (P2); L may be large!)
≤L max
0≤s≤T |u(s) −u(s)|.
472

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
We exploit the fact that the last term does not contain derivatives: For
0 ≤s ≤T,
|u(s) −u(s)| = |0 −0 +
 s
0
( ˙u(r) −˙u(r))dr| ≤T∥u −u∥C1
0T .
Hence
|˙v(t) −˙v(t)| ≤L T ∥u −u∥C1
0T .
Also,
|v(t) −v(t)| = |
 t
0
(f(us + ˆφs) −f(us + ˆφs))ds| ≤L T max
0≤s≤t ∥us −us∥
≤L T ∥u −u∥C1
0T .
(Property (P2) is not necessary here. Alternatively the local Lipschitz
continuity of f with respect to the norm on C1 can be used to ﬁnd a
suitable upper estimate.)
For 2 L T < 1 the map A(φ, ·) becomes a contraction. One ﬁnds a
closed ball which is mapped into itself by each map A(φ, ·). The formula
deﬁning A shows that A is continuously diﬀerentiable. It follows that for
each φ the ball contains a ﬁxed point uφ of A(φ, ·) which is continuously
diﬀerentiable with respect to φ. This completes the essential step in the
proof of the theorem.
We give an example which is based on elementary physics. Consider
an object on a line which attempts to regulate its position x(t) by echo.
The object emits a signal which is then reﬂected by an obstacle. The re-
ﬂected signal is detected and the signal running time is measured. From
this a position is computed (which is not necessarily the true position).
The computed position is followed by an acceleration towards a pre-
ferred position (e.g., an equilibrium position in a certain distance from
the obstacle).
Let c > 0 denote the speed of the signals, −w < 0 the position of the
obstacle, and µ > 0 a friction constant. The acceleration is given by a
function a : R →R; one may think of negative feedback:
a(0) = 0 and ξ a(ξ) < 0 for ξ ̸= 0.
Let x(t) denote the position of the object at time t, v(t) its velocity, p(t)
the computed position, and s(t) the running time of the signal which has
473

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
been emitted at time t −s(t) and whose reﬂection is detected at time t.
The model equations then are
˙x(t) = v(t)
˙v(t) = −µv(t) + a(p(t))
p(t) = c
2s(t) −w
c s(t) = x(t −s(t)) + x(t) + 2w
Here only solutions with
−w < x(t)
are considered. The formula deﬁning p(t) yields the true position if
x(t) = x(t −s(t)),
which holds at least at equilibria.
Let w+ > 0. Restrict attention further to bounded solutions with
−w < x(t) < w+
and
| ˙x(t)| < c.
Then necessarily
0 < s(t) ≤2w + 2w+
c
= h.
The model has not yet the form (3) considered in the theorem. In
order to reformulate the model, take h as just deﬁned, consider the
space
C1 = C1([−h, 0], R2),
and the open convex subset
U = {φ = (φ1, φ2) ∈C1 : −w < φ1(t) < w+, | ˙φ1(t)| < c for −h ≤t ≤0}.
Each φ ∈U determines a unique solution s = σ(φ) of
s = 1
c(φ1(−s) + φ1(0) + 2w),
as the right hand side of this ﬁxed point equation deﬁnes a contraction
on [0, h]. The Implicit Function Theorem shows that the resulting map
σ : U →[0, h]
is continuously diﬀerentiable. Elementary estimates imply that it is also
Lipschitz continuous with respect to the norm on C = C([−h, 0], R2).
474

Dynamics of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
I.e., an analogue of property (P2) holds.
Assume the response function a : R →R is continuously diﬀerentiable.
Then the map
f : U →R2
given by
f1(φ) = φ2(0),
and
f2(φ) = −µφ2(0) + a(c
2σ(φ) −w) = −µφ2(0) + a

is continuously diﬀerentiable and has property (P2), and for bounded
solutions as above the model can be rewritten in the form of eq. (5.1).
Veriﬁcation of property (P1). For each φ ∈U and all χ ∈C1,
Dσ(φ)χ = Ev1(χ1, −σ(φ)) + Ev1(χ1, 0)
Ev1( ˙φ1, −σ(φ)) −c
= χ1(−σ(φ)) + χ1(0)
˙φ1(−σ(φ)) −c
,
with the evaluation map
Ev1 : C1([−h, 0], R) × [−h, 0] ∋(ψ, t) →ψ(t) ∈R.
Each Ev1(·, t), t ∈[−h, 0], is the restriction of a continuous linear evalua-
tion functional on the space C([−h, 0], R). It follows that Dσ(φ) : C1 →
R has a continuous linear extension Deσ(φ) : C →R. The formula
Df2(φ)χ = −µEv1(χ2, 0) + Da(c
2σ(φ) −w)c
2Dσ(φ)χ
ﬁnally shows that f has property (P1).
Suppose
a(0) = 0.
Then φ = 0 is a stationary point, and
σ(0) = 2w
c .
The previous calculations show that the variational equation from the
theorem is the system
˙v1(t) = v2(t)
˙v2(t) = −µv2(t) + a′(0)v1(t −2w/c) + v1(t)
2
.
475

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Notice that the heuristic approach (freeze the delay, then linearize) yields
the very same system.
Back to general results. The semiﬂow F from the theorem is continu-
ously diﬀerentiable for t > h provided f satisﬁes (P1) and the condition
that
(P1∗)
the map U × C ∋(φ, χ) →Def(φ)χ ∈Rn is continuous.
Remarks.
Notice that continuous diﬀerentiability of the semiﬂow (for t > h)
is needed in order to have Poincar´e return maps for periodic orbits,
among others.
(P1) and (P1∗) imply (P2).
(P1∗) holds for the example.
The stronger condition that the map
U ∋φ →Def(φ) ∈L(C, Rn)
be continuous is not satisﬁed by the example.
The solution maps Ft are compact for t ≥h under certain other
hypotheses on f. The latter are satisﬁed by the example for suitable
functions a.
Further work, Open Problems.
For continuously diﬀerentiable center manifolds of the semiﬂow,
see the forthcoming survey article [107] and [134]. A ﬁrst Hopf
bifurcation theorem for diﬀerential equations with state-dependent
delay is due to M. Eichmann [62].
Can the approach be generalized so that one obtains higher order
derivatives for semiﬂows given by diﬀerential equations with state-
dependent delay?
For suitable parameters stable periodic motion far away from equi-
librium was established in [248].
A related but in several respects more complicated problem is the
description of the motion of two charged particles, which was ini-
tiated by R.D. Driver [61].

Introduction
Time delays of one type or another have been incorporated into biolog-
ical models to represent resource regeneration times, maturation periods,
feeding times, reaction times, etc. by many researchers. We refer to the
monographs of Cushing (1977a), Gopalsamy (1992), Kuang (1993) and
MacDonald (1978) for discussions of general delayed biological systems.
In general, delay diﬀerential equations exhibit much more complicated
dynamics than ordinary diﬀerential equations since a time delay could
cause a stable equilibrium to become unstable and cause the populations
to ﬂuctuate. In this survey, we shall review various delay diﬀerential
equations models arising from studying single species dynamics.
Let x(t) denote the population size at time t; let b and d denote the
birth rate and death rate, respectively, on the time interval [t, t + ∆t],
where ∆t > 0. Then
x(t + ∆t) −x(t) = bx(t)∆t −dx(t)∆t.
Dividing by ∆t and letting ∆t approach zero, we obtain

dx
dt = bx −dx = rx,
(1.1)
where r = b −d is the intrinsic growth rate of the population.
The
solution of equation (1.1) with an initial population x(0) = x0 is given
by
x(t) = x0ert.
(1.2)
The function (1.2) represents the traditional exponential growth if r > 0
or decay if r < 0 of a population. Such a population growth, due to
Malthus (1798), may be valid for a short period, but it cannot go on
forever. Taking the fact that resources are limited into account, Verhulst
(1836) proposed the logistic equation
dx
dt = rx

1 −x
K

,
(1.3)
where r(> 0) is the intrinsic growth rate and K(> 0) is the carrying ca-
pacity of the population. In model (1.3), when x is small the population
grows as in the Malthusian model (1.1); when x is large the members of
the species compete with each other for the limited resources. Solving
(1.3) by separating the variables, we obtain (x(0) = x0)
x(t) =
x0K
x0 −(x0 −K)e−rt .
(1.4)
If x0 < K, the population grows, approaching K asymptotically as
t →∞.
If x0 > K, the population decreases, again approaching K
asymptotically as t →∞. If x0 = K, the population remains in time at
x = K. In fact, x = K is called an equilibrium of equation (1.3). Thus,
the positive equilibrium x = K of the logistic equation (1.3) is globally
stable; that is, lim
t→∞x(t) = K for solution x(t) of (1.3) with any initial
value x(0) = x0.
2.
Hutchinson’s Equation
In the above logistic model it is assumed that the growth rate of a
population at any time t depends on the relative number of individuals
at that time. In practice, the process of reproduction is not instanta-
neous. For example, in Daphnia a large clutch presumably is determined
not by the concentration of unconsumed food available when the eggs
hatch, but by the amount of food available when the eggs were forming,
some time before they pass into the broad pouch. Between this time
of determination and the time of hatching many newly hatched animals
may have been liberated from the brood pouches of other Daphnia in

DDE in Single Species Dynamics

the culture, so increasing the population. In fact, in an extreme case all
the vacant spaces K −x might have been ﬁlled well before reproduction
stops. Hutchinson (1948) assumed egg formation to occur τ units of
time before hatching and proposed the following more realistic logistic
equation
dx
dt = rx(t)

1 −x(t −τ)
K

,
(2.1)
where r and K have the same meaning as in the logistic equation (1.3),
τ > 0 is a constant. Equation (2.1) is often referred to as the Hutchin-
son’s equation or delayed logistic equation.
2.1
Stability and Bifurcation
The initial value of equation (2.1) is given by
x(θ) = φ(θ) > 0,
θ ∈[−τ, 0],
where φ is continuous on [−τ, 0]. An equilibrium x = x∗of (2.1) is stable
if for any given ϵ > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that |φ(t) −x∗| ≤δ on [−τ, 0]
implies that all solutions x(t) of (2.1) with initial value φ on [−τ, 0]
satisfy |x(t) −x∗| < ϵ for all t ≥0. If in addition there is a δ0 > 0 such
that |φ(t) −x∗| ≤δ0 on [−τ, 0] implies lim
t→∞x(t) = x∗, then x∗is called
asymptotically stable.
Notice that equation (2.1) has equilibria x = 0 and x = K. Small
perturbations from x = 0 satisfy the linear equation dx
dt = rx, which
shows that x = 0 is unstable with exponential growth. We thus only
need to consider the stability of the positive equilibrium x = K. Let
X = x −K. Then,
dX
dt = −rX(t −τ) −r
K X(t)X(t −τ).
Thus, the linearized equation is
dX
dt = −rX(t −τ).
(2.2)
We look for solutions of the form X(t) = ceλt, where c is a constant and
the eigenvalues λ are solutions of the characteristic equation
λ + re−λτ = 0,
(2.3)
which is a transcendental equation. By the linearization theory, x = K is
asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues of (2.3) have negative real parts.

480
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Set λ = µ + iν. Separating the real and imaginary parts of the char-
acteristic equation (2.3), we obtain
µ + re−µτ cos ντ = 0,
ν −re−µτ sin ντ = 0.
(2.4)
Notice that when τ = 0, the characteristic equation (2.3) becomes λ+r =
0 and the eigenvalue λ = −r < 0 is a negative real number. We seek
conditions on τ such that Reλ changes from negative to positive. By the
continuity, if λ changes from −r to a value such that Reλ = µ > 0 when
τ increases, there must be some value of τ, say τ0, at which Reλ(τ0) =
µ(τ0) = 0. In other words, the characteristic equation (2.3) must have
a pair of purely imaginary roots ±iν0, ν0 = ν(τ0). Suppose such is the
case. Then we have
cos ν0τ = 0,
which implies that
νoτk = π
2 + 2kπ, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Noting that νo = r, we have
τk = π
2r + 2kπ
r , k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Therefore, when

Denote λ(τ) = µ(τ) + iν(τ) the root of equation (2.3) satisfying

(i) If 0 ≤rτ < π

of equation ( 2.1) is asymptotically stable.
(ii) If rτ > π
2 , then x = K is unstable.
(iii) When rτ = π

solutions bifurcate from x = K. The periodic solutions exist for
rτ > π

The above theorem can be illustrated by Fig. 11.1, where the solid
curves represent stability while the dashed lines indicate instability.
By (iii), the Hutchinson’s equation (2.1) can have periodic solutions
for a large range of values of rτ, the product of the birth rate r and
the delay τ. If T is the period then x(t + T) = x(t) for all t. Roughly
speaking, the stability of a periodic solution means that if a perturbation
is imposed the solution returns to the original periodic solution as t →∞
with possibly a phase shift. The period of the solution at the critical
delay value is 2π
ν0 (Hassard et al. (1981)), thus, it is 4τ (see Fig. 11.2).
Numerical simulations are given in Fig. 11.3.

(2.5)
By Theorem 1, we know that the zero solution of (2.5) is asymptotically
stable if α < π/2 and unstable if α > π/2. Wright (1955) showed that
the zero solution of (2.5) is globally stable if α < 3/2. Wright then
conjectured that the zero solution of (2.5) is globally stable if α < π/2,
which is still open.
Kakutani and Markus (1958) proved that all solutions of (2.5) oscil-
late if α > 1/e and do not oscillate if α < 1/e. Jones (1962a, 1962b)
studied the global existence of periodic solutions for α > π/2. For fur-
ther research on existence of non-constant periodic solutions, see Hadeler
and Tomiuk (1977), Hale and Verduyn Lunel (1993), Kaplan and York
(1975), Naussbaum (1974), Walther (1975), etc. See also Kuang (1993)
for further results and more references.
Recently, some attention has been paid to the study of equation (2.5)
when α = α(t) is a positive continuous function. For example, Sugie
(1992) showed that the zero solution of (2.5) with α = α(t) is uniformly
stable if there is a constant α0 > 0 such that
α(t) ≤α0 < 3
2 for all t ≥0.

Instantaneous Dominance
Consider a logistic equation with a discrete delay of the form
dx
dt = rx(t)[1 −a1x(t) −a2x(t −τ)],
(2.8)
where a1 and a2 are positive constants. There is a positive equilibrium
x∗=
1
a1+a2 , which is stable when there is no delay. Employing similar
arguments, one can prove the following results.
Theorem 2
(i) If a1 ≥a2, then the steady state x∗=
1
a1+a2 is as-
ymptotically stable for all delay τ ≥0.
(ii) If a1 < a2, then there is a critical value τ0 given by
τ0 =

such that x∗=

a1+a2 is asymptotically stable when τ ∈[0, τ0) and
unstable when τ > τ0. A Hopf bifurcation occurs at x∗when τ
passes through τ0.
The above result indicates that if a1 ≥a2, that is, if the instantaneous
term is dominant, then the steady state x∗=
1
a1+a2 is asymptotically
stable for all delay τ ≥0. In fact, we can show that it is asymptotically
stable for any initial value, that is, globally stable.
Theorem 3 If a1 > a2, then the steady state x∗=
1
a1+a2 of ( 2.8) is
globally stable.
Proof. Suppose x is a continuous function from [−τ, r) to R and
denote xt(θ) = x(t + θ), θ ∈[−τ, 0]. Choose a Lyapunov function of the
form

Recruitment Models
3.1
Nicholson’s Blowﬂies Model
The Hutchinson’s equation (2.1) can be used to explain several ex-
perimental situations, including Nicholson’s (1954) careful experimental
data of the Australian sheep-blowﬂy (Lucila cuprina). Over a period of
nearly two years Nicholson recorded the population of ﬂies and observed
a regular basic periodic oscillation of about 35-40 days. To apply the
Hutchinson’s equation (2.1), K is set by the food level available, τ is
approximately the time for a larva to mature into an adult. The only
unknown parameter is r, the intrinsic growth rate of the population. If
we take the observed period as 40 days, then the delay is about 9 days:
the actual delay is about 15 days.
To overcome the discrepancy in estimating the delay value, Gurney
et al. (1980) tried to modify Hutchinson’s equation. Notice that Nichol-
son’s data on blowﬂies consist primarily of observations of the time vari-
ation of adult population. Let x(t) denote the population of sexually
mature adults. Then the rate of change of x(t) is the instantaneous rate
of recruitment to the adult population R(t) minus the instantaneous
total death rate D(t) :
dx
dt = R(t) −D(t).
To express R(t) we have to consider the populations of all the various
stages in the life-history of the species concerned and make the following
assumptions:
(i) all eggs take exactly τ time units to develop into sexually mature
adults;

DDE in Single Species Dynamics
485
(ii) the rate at which the adult population produces eggs depends only
on its current size;
(iii) the probability of a given egg maturing into a viable adult depends
only on the number of competitors of the same age.
These imply that the rate of recruitment at time t + τ is a function
only of the instantaneous size of the adult population at time t. Assume
that the average per capita fecundity drops exponentially with increasing
population, thus
R(t + τ) = θ(x(t)) = Px(t) exp[−x(t)/x0],
where P is the maximum per capita daily egg production rate, x0 is the
size at which the blowﬂies population reproduces at its maximum rate,
and δ is the per capita daily adult death rate.
Assume that the per capita adult death rate has a time and density
independent value δ. The additional assumption that the total death rate
D(t) is a function only of the instantaneous size of the adult population
D(t) = φ(x(t)) = δx(t)
enables the entire population dynamics to be expressed in the delay
diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = Px(t −τ) exp

−x(t −τ)
x0

−δx(t).
(3.1)
There is a positive equilibrium
x∗= x0 ln(P/δ)
if the maximum possible per capita reproduction rate is greater than the
per capita death rate, that is, if P > δ. As in the Hutchinson’s equation,
there is a critical value of the time delay. The positive equilibrium is
stable when the delay is less the critical value, becomes unstable when
it is greater the value, and there are oscillations. Testing Nicholson’s
data, equation (3.1) not only provides self-sustaining limit cycles as the
Hutchinson’s equation did, but also gives an accurate measurement of
the delay value as 15 days. Gurney et al. (1980) showed that the ﬂuc-
tuations observed by Nicholson are quite clear, of limit-cycle type (see
Fig. 11.4). The period of the cycles is set mainly by the delay and adult
death rate. High values of Pτ and δτ will give large amplitude cycles.
Moving deeper into instability produces a number of successive dou-
blings of the repeated time until a region is reached where the solution
becomes aperiodic (chaotic). See Fig. 11.5.

3.2
Houseﬂies Model
To describe the oscillations of the adult numbers in laboratory popu-
lations of houseﬂies Musca domestica, Taylor and Sokal (1976) proposed
the delay equation
dx
dt = −dx(t) + bx(t −τ)[k −bzx(t −τ)],

and Sokal (1976).
where x(t) is the number of adults, d > 0 denotes the death rate of
adults, the time delay τ > 0 is the length of the developmental period
between oviposition and eclosion of adults. The number of eggs laid is
assumed to be proportional to the number of adults, so at time t−τ the
number of new eggs would be bx(t −τ), where b > 0 is the number of
eggs laid par adult. k −bzx(t −τ) represents the egg-to-adult survival
rate, where k > 0 is the maximum egg-adult survival rate, and z is the
reduction in survival produced by each additional egg. Notice that when
there is no time delay, i.e., τ = 0, then the equation becomes the familiar
logistic equation.
Though analytical analysis of equation (3.2) has never been carried
out, numerical simulations indicate that its dynamics are very similar
to that of the Nicholson’s blowﬂies equation (see Fig. 11.6). However,
unlike the Nicholson’s model, aperiodic oscillations have not been ob-
served.
3.3
Recruitment Models
Blythe et al.
(1982) proposed a general single species population
model with a time delay
dx
dt = R(x(t −τ)) −Dx(t),
(3.3)
where R and D represent the rates of recruitment to, and death rate
from, an adult population of size x, and τ > 0 is the maturation period.
For a linear analysis of the model, see Brauer and Castillo-Ch´avez (2001).

488
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
This equation could exhibit very complex dynamic behavior for some
functions R, such as R(x(t −τ)) = Px(t −τ) exp[−x(t −τ)/x0] in the
Nicholson’s blowﬂies equation. However, for some other functions, for
example
R(x(t −τ)) =
bx2(t −τ)
x(t −τ) + x0

1 −x(t −τ)
K

as in Beddington and May (1975), the time delay is not necessarily
destabilizing (see also Rodr´ıguez (1998)).
Freedman and Gopalsamy (1986) studied three classes of general sin-
gle species models with a single delay and established criteria for the
positive equilibrium to be globally stable independent of the length of
delay. See also Cao and Gard (1995), Karakostas et al. (1992).
4.
The Allee Eﬀect
The logistic equation was based on the assumption that the density
has a negative eﬀect on the per-capita growth rate.
However, some
species often cooperate among themselves in their search for food and
to escape from their predators. For example some species form hunt-
ing groups (packs, prides, etc.) to enable them to capture large prey.
Fish and birds often form schools and ﬂocks as a defense against their
predators. Some parasitic insects aggregate so that they can overcome
the defense mechanism of a host. A number of social species such as
ants, termites, bees, etc., have developed complex cooperative behavior
involving division of labor, altruism, etc.
Such cooperative processes
have a positive feedback inﬂuence since individuals have been provided
a greater chance to survive and reproduce as density increase. Aggrega-
tion and associated cooperative and social characteristics among mem-
bers of a species were extensively studied in animal populations by Allee
(1931), the phenomenon in which reproduction rates of individuals de-
crease when density drops below a certain critical level is now known as
the Allee eﬀect.
Gopalsamy and Ladas (1990) proposed a single species population
model exhibiting the Allee eﬀect in which the per capita growth rate is
a quadratic function of the density and is subject to time delays:
dx
dt = x(t)[a + bx(t −τ) −cx2(t −τ)],
(4.1)
where a > 0, c > 0, τ ≥0, and b are real constants. In the model, when
the density of the population is not small, the positive feedback eﬀects of
aggregation and cooperation are dominated by density-dependent stabi-
lizing negative feedback eﬀects due to intraspeciﬁc competition. In other

ciﬁc competition dominates at higher densities.
Equation (4.1) has a positive equilibrium

.
Gopalsamy and Ladas (1990) showed that under some restrictive as-
sumptions, the positive equilibrium is globally attractive (see Fig. 11.7).
If the delay is suﬃciently large, solutions of equation (4.1) oscillate about
the positive equilibrium. See also Cao and Gard (1995). The following
result is a corollary of the main results of Liz et al. (2003).
Theorem 4 If
τx∗(2cx∗−b) ≤3
2,
then the equilibrium x∗attracts all positive solutions of ( 4.1).
Ladas and Qian (1994) generalized (4.1) to the form
dx
dt = x(t)[a + bxp(t −τ) −cxq(t −τ)],
(4.2)
where p, q are positive constants, and discussed oscillation and global
attractivity in the solutions.

we can see that the average growth rate of a population is a linear
function of its density.
In experiments of bacteria cultures Daphnia
magna Smith (1963) found that the average growth rate (1/x)(dx/dt) is
not a linear function of the density. Smith argued that the per capita
growth rate of a population is proportional to the rate of food supply
not momentarily being used. This results in the model:
1

(5.1)
where F is the rate at which a population of biomass x consumes re-
sources, and T is the rate at which the population uses food when it is
at the equilibrium K. Note that F/T is not usually equal to x/K. It is
assumed that F depends on the density x (that is being maintained) and
dx/dt (the rate of change of the density) and takes the following form:
F = c1x + c2
dx

c1 > 0,
c2 ≥0.
When saturation is attained, dx/dt = 0, x = K and T = F. Thus,
T = c1K and equation (5.1) becomes

very similar to the Hutchinson’s model.

Regulation of Haematopoiesis
Haematopoiesis is the process by which primitive stem cells proliferate
and diﬀerentiate to produce mature blood cells. It is driven by highly
coordinated patterns of gene expression under the inﬂuence of growth
factors and hormones. The regulation of haematopoiesis is about the
formation of blood cell elements in the body.
White and red blood
cells are produced in the bone marrow from where they enter the blood
stream. The principal factor stimulating red blood cell product is the
hormone produced in the kidney, called erythropoiesis. About 90% of
the erythropoiesis is secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells when blood
is unable to deliver suﬃcient oxygen. When the level of oxygen in the
blood decreases this leads to a release of a substance, which in turn
causes an increase in the release of the blood elements from the marrow.
There is a feedback from the blood to the bone marrow. Abnormalities
in the feedback are considered as major suspects in causing periodic
haematopological disease.
6.1
Mackey-Glass Models
Let c(t) be the concentration of cells (the population species) in the
circulating blood with units cells/mm3. Assume that the cells are lost at
a rate proportional to their concentration, say, gc, where g has dimension
(day−1). After the reduction in cells in the blood stream there is about
a 6-day delay before the marrow releases further cells to replenish the
deﬁciency. Assume the ﬂux of cells into the blood stream depends on
the cell concentration at an earlier time, c(t −τ), where τ is the delay.

(6.1)
where λ, a, m, g and τ are positive constants. The numerical simulations
of equation (6.1) by Mackey and Glass (1977) (see also Mackey and
Milton (1988)) indicate that there is a cascading sequence of bifurcating
periodic solutions when the delay is increased (see Fig. 11.9). When the
delay is further increased the periodic solutions becomes aperiodic and
chaotic (see Fig. 11.10).

Wazewska-Czyzewska and Lasota Model
Another well-known model belongs to Wazewska-Czyzewska and La-
sota (1976) which takes the form
dN
dt = −µN(t) + pe−γN(t−τ),
(6.2)
where N(t) denotes the number of red-blood cells at time t, µ is the
probability of death of a red-blood cell, p and γ are positive constants
related to the production of red-blood cells per unit time and τ is the
time required to produce a red-blood cells. See also Arino and Kimmel
(1986).
Global attractivity in the Mackey-Glass model (6.1) and the Lasota-
Wazewska model (6.2) has been studied by Gopalsamy et al. (1990b),
Karakostas et al.
(1992), Kuang (1992) and Gy¨ori and Troﬁmchuk
(1999).
Liz et al.
(2002) study these models when the delay is inﬁ-
nite.
Other types of delay physiological models can be found in Mackey
and Milton (1988,1990) and Fowler and Mackey (2002).
7.
A Vector Disease Model
Let y(t) denote the infected host population and x(t) be the popu-
lation of uninfected human. Assume that the total host population is
constant and is scaled so that
x(t) + y(t) = 1.
The disease is transmitted to the host by an insect vector, assumed to
have a large and constant population, and by the host to that vector.
Within the vector there is an incubation period τ before the disease
agent can infect a host. So the population of vectors capable of infecting
the host is
z(t) = dy(t −τ).
where d is the infective rate of the vectors.
Infection of the host is
assumed to proceed at a rate (e) proportional to encounters between
uninfected host and vectors capable of transmitting the disease,
ex(t) · dy(t −τ) = by(t −τ)[1 −y(t)],
and recovery to proceed exponentially at a rate c. Thus, b is the contact
rate. Infection leads neither to death, immunity or isolation. Based on
these assumptions, Cooke (1978) proposed a delay model
dy
dt = by(t −τ)[1 −y(t)] −ay(t),
(7.1)
where a > 0 is the cure rate.

Numerical simulations for the vector disease equation (7.1).
When
a = 5.8, b = 4.8(a > b), the zero steady state u = 0 is asymptotically stable; When
a = 3.8, b = 4.8(a < b), the positive steady state u∗is asymptotically stable for all
delay values; here for both cases τ = 5.
Using the Liapunov functional method, he obtained the following re-
sults on global stability of the steady states.
Theorem 5
For the vector disease model ( 7.1), we have the following:
(i) If 0 < b ≤a, then the steady state solution u0 = 0 is asymptotically
stable and the set {φ ∈([−τ, 0], R) : 0 ≤φ(θ) ≤1 for
−τ ≤θ ≤
0} is a region of attraction.
(ii) If 0 ≤a < b, then the steady state solution u1 = (b −a)/b is
asymptotically stable and the set {φ ∈([−τ, 0], R) : 0 < φ(θ) ≤
1 for −τ ≤θ ≤0} is a region of attraction.
The stability results indicate that there is a threshold at b = a. If
b ≤a, then the proportion u of infectious individuals tends to zero as
t becomes large and the disease dies out. If b > a, the proportion of
infectious individuals tends to an endemic level u1 = (b −a)/b as t
becomes large. There is no non-constant periodic solutions in the region
0 ≤u ≤1. Numerical simulations are given in Fig. 11.11.
Busenberg and Cooke (1978) studied the existence of periodic solu-
tions in the vector-host model (7.1) when b = b(t) is a positive periodic
function.

Multiple Delays
Kitching (1977) pointed out that the life cycle of the Australian
blowﬂy Lucila cuprina has multiple time delay features which need to
be considered in modelling its population. Based on this observation,
Braddock and van den Driessche (1983) proposed the two delay logistic
equation (see also Gopalsamy (1990))
dx
dt = rx(t)[1 −a1x(t −τ1) −a2x(t −τ2)],
(8.1)
where r, a1, a2, τ1 and τ2 are positive constants. Other equations with
two delays appear in neurological models (B´elair and Campbell (1994)),
physiological models (Beuter et al. (1993)), medical models (B´elair et
al. (1995)), epidemiological models (Cooke and Yorke (1973)), etc. Very
rich dynamics have been observed in such equations (Hale and Huang
(1993), Mahaﬀy et al. (1995)).
Equation (8.1) has a positive equilibrium x∗= 1/(a1 +a2). Let x(t) =
x∗(1 + X(t)). Then (8.1) becomes
˙X(t) = −(1 + X(t))[A1X(t −τ1) + A2X(t −τ2)],
(8.2)
where A1 = ra1x∗, A2 = ra2x∗. The linearized equation of (8.2) at X = 0
is
˙X(t) = −A1X(t −τ1) −A2X(t −τ2).
Braddock and van den Driessche (1983) described some linear stability
regions for equation (8.1) and observed stable limit cycles when τ2/τ1 is
large. Gopalsamy (1990) obtained stability conditions for the positive
equilibrium. Using the results in Li et al. (1999), we can obtain the
following theorem on the stability and bifurcation of equation (8.1).
Theorem 6 If one of the following conditions is satisﬁed:
(i) A1 < A2 and τ1 > 0 such that

Volterra Integrodiﬀerential Equations
The Hutchinson’s equation (2.1) means that the regulatory eﬀect de-
pends on the population at a ﬁxed earlier time t −τ, rather than at
the present time t. In a more realistic model the delay eﬀect should
be an average over past populations. This results in an equation with
a distributed delay or an inﬁnite delay. The ﬁrst work using a logistic
equation with distributed delay was by Volterra (1934) with extensions
by Kostitzin (1939). In the 1930’s, many experiments were performed
with laboratory populations of some species of small organisms with
short generation time. Attempts to apply logistic models to these ex-
periments were often unsuccessful because populations died out. One of

DDE in Single Species Dynamics
497
the causes was the pollution of the closed environment by waste prod-
ucts and dead organisms. Volterra (1934) used an integral term or a
distributed delay term to examine a cumulative eﬀect in the death rate
of a species, depending on the population at all times from the start of
the experiment. The model is an integro-diﬀerential equation

where G(t), called the delay kernel, is a weighting factor which indi-
cates how much emphasis should be given to the size of the population
at earlier times to determine the present eﬀect on resource availability.
Usually the delay kernel is normalized so that
 ∞

G(u)du = 1.
In this way we ensure that for equation (9.1) the equilibrium of the
instantaneous logistic equation (1.3) remains an equilibrium in the pres-
ence of time delay. If G(u) is the Dirac function δ(τ −t), where

The average delay for the kernel is deﬁned as

It follows that if G(u) = δ(u −τ), then T = τ, the discrete delay. We
usually use the Gamma distribution delay kernel

(n −1)!
,
n = 1, 2, . . .
(9.2)
where α > 0 is a constant, n an integer, with the average delay T = n/α.
Two special cases,
G(u) = αe−αu (n = 1),
G(u) = α2ue−αu; (n = 2),
are called weak delay kernel and strong delay kernel, respectively. The
weak kernel qualitatively indicates that the maximum weighted response

of the growth rate is due to current population density while past den-
sities have (exponentially) decreasing inﬂuence. On the other hand the
strong kernel means that the maximum inﬂuence on growth rate re-
sponse at any time t is due to population density at the previous time
t −T (see Fig. 11.13).
The initial value for the integro-diﬀerential equation (9.1) is
x(θ) = φ(θ) ≥0, −∞< θ ≤0,
(9.3)
where φ(θ) is continuous on (−∞, 0]. Following Volterra (1931) or Miller
(1971), we can obtain existence, uniqueness, continuity and continuation
about solutions to such a kind of integro-diﬀerential equations.
An equilibrium x∗of equation (9.1) is called stable if given any ϵ > 0
there exists a δ = δ(ϵ) > 0 such that |φ(t) −x∗| ≤δ for t ∈(−∞, 0]
implies that any solution x(t) of (9.1) and (9.3) exists and satisﬁes |x(t)−
x∗| < ϵ for all t ≥0. If in addition there exists a constant δ0 > 0 such
that |φ(t) −x∗| ≤δ on (−∞, 0] implies lim
t→∞x(t) = x∗, then x∗is called
asymptotically stable.

dt = αx(t) −αy(t).
(9.6)
Notice that the positive equilibrium of system (9.6) is (x∗, y∗) = (K, K).
To determine the stability of (x∗, y∗), let X = x −x∗, Y = y −y∗. The
characteristic equation of the linearized system is given by
λ2 + αλ + αr = 0,
(9.7)
which has roots
λ1,2 = −α

Therefore, Reλ1,2 < 0, which implies that x∗= K is locally asymptoti-
cally stable.
In fact, x∗= K is globally stable. Rewrite (9.1) as follows:
dx
dt = −r
K x(t)(y(t) −y∗),
dy
dt = α(x(t) −x∗) −α(y(t) −y∗).

Since the positive quadrant is invariant, it follows that solutions of sys-
tem (9.8), and hence of (9.1), approach (x∗, y∗) as t →∞. Therefore,
x(t) →x∗as t →∞.
The above analysis can be summarized as the following theorem.
Theorem 7 The positive equilibrium x∗= K of the logistic equation
( 9.1) with a weak kernel is globally stable (see Fig. 11.14).

The steady state of the integrodiﬀerential equation (9.1) is globally
stable. Here r = 0.15, K = 1.00.
The result indicates that if the delay kernel is a weak kernel, the logis-
tic equation with distributed delay has properties similar to the instan-
taneous logistic equation. We shall see that the logistic equation with
a strong kernel exhibits richer dynamics similar to the logistic equation
with a constant delay.
9.2
Strong Kernel
Consider the logistic equation (9.1) with a strong kernel, i.e.,

Then equation (9.10) is equivalent to the system

dy
dt = αx(t) −αy(t),

(9.11)
which has a positive equilibrium (x∗, y∗, ϵ∗) = (K, K, K). Considering
the linearization of (9.11) at (x∗, y∗, z∗), we obtain the characteristic
equation
λ3 + a1λ2 + a2λ + a3 = 0,
(9.12)

DDE in Single Species Dynamics
501
where
a1 = 2α,
a2 = α2,
a3 = rα2.
The Routh-Hurwitz criterion says that all roots of the equation (9.12)
have negative real parts if and only if the following inequalities hold:
a1 > 0,
a3 > 0,
a1a2 −a3 > 0.
(9.13)
Clearly, a1 = 2α > 0, a3 = rα2 > 0. The last inequality becomes
α > r
2.
(9.14)
Thus, the equilibrium x∗= K is stable if α > r/2 and unstable if
α < r/2. Note that the average delay of the strong kernel is deﬁned as
T = 2/α. Inequality (9.14) then becomes
T < 4
r.
(9.15)
Therefore, the equilibrium x∗= K is stable for “short delays” (T < 4/r)
and is unstable for “long delays” (T > 4/r).
When T = T0 = 4/r, (9.12) has a negative real root λ1 = −r and a
pair of purely imaginary roots λ2,3 = ±i r
2. Denote by
λ(T) = µ(T) + iν(T)
the complex eigenvalue of (9.12) such that u(T0) = 0, ν(T0) = r/2. We
can verify that

T= 4

5r2 > 0.
(9.16)
The transversality condition (9.16) thus implies that system (9.11) and
hence equation (9.10) exhibits a Hopf bifurcation as the average delay
T passes through the critical value T0 = 4/r (Marsden and McKraeken
(1976)).
We thus have the following theorem regarding equation (9.10).
Theorem 8 The positive equilibrium x∗= K of equation ( 9.10) is as-
ymptotically stable if the average delay T = 2/α < 4/r and unstable if
T > 4/r. When T = 4/r, a Hopf bifurcation occurs at x∗= K and a
family of periodic solutions bifurcates from x∗= K, the period of the
bifurcating solutions is
π
ν0 =
2π
r , and the periodic solutions exist for
T > 4/r and are orbitally stable.
Thus, the logistic equation with a strong delay kernel, just like the
logistic equation with a discrete delay, exhibits a typical bifurcation
phenomenon. As the (average) delay is increased through a critical value
the positive equilibrium passes from stability to instability, accompanied
by the appearance of stable periodic solutions (see Fig. 11.15).

9.3
General Kernel
Now consider the stability of the equilibrium x∗= K for the integrod-
iﬀerential equation (9.1) with a general kernel. Let X = x −K. Then
(9.1) can be written as

(9.17)
and the characteristic equation takes the form

(9.18)
If all eigenvalues of the characteristic equation (9.18) have negative real
parts, then the solution X = 0 of (9.17), that is, the equilibrium x∗= K
of (9.1), is asymptotically stable.
Theorem 9 If

then x∗= K of ( 9.1) is asymptotically stable.

Proof. Since the roots of (9.18) coincide with the zeros of the function
g(λ) = λ + r
 ∞
0
G(s)e−λsds,
we may apply the argument principle to g(λ) along the contour Γ =
Γ(a, ε) that constitutes the boundary of the region
{λ| ε ≤Reλ ≤a, −a ≤Im ≤a, 0 < ε < a}.
Since the zeros of g(λ) are isolated, we may choose a and ε so that
no zeros of g(λ) lie on Γ. The argument principle now states that the
number of zeros of g(λ) contained in the region bounded by Γ is equal to
the number of times g(λ) wraps Γ around the origin as λ traverses Γ. (A
zero of g(λ) of multiplicity m is counted m times.) Thus, it suﬃces to
show for all small ε > 0 and all large a > r, that g(λ) does not encircle
0 as λ traverses Γ(a, ε).
Along the segment of Γ given by λ = a + iν, −a ≤µ ≤a, we have
g(a + iν) = a + iν + r
 ∞
0
G(s)e−(a+iν)sds.
Since a > 0, it follows that

 ∞

G(s)e−(a+iν)sds
 ≤
 ∞

G(s)ds = 1.
Because a > r, we may conclude that every real value assumed by g(λ)
along this segment must be positive. Along the segment of Γ given by
λ = µ + ia, ε ≤µ ≤a, we have
g(µ + ia) = µ + ia + r
 ∞
0
G(s)e−(µ+ia)sds.
A similar argument shows g(λ) to assume no real value along this path.
In fact, Img(µ + ia) is always positive here. Similarly, one can show
that Img(µ −ia) is negative along the segment λ = µ −ia, ε ≤µ ≤a.
By continuity, g(λ) must assume at least one positive real value (and no
negative values) as λ travels clockwise from ε + ia to ε −ia along Γ.
Finally, consider the path traced out as λ = ε + iν increases from
ε −ia to ε + ia. Under the assumption, Img(ε + iν) is seen to increase

It follows immediately that g(λ) assumes precisely one real value along
this last segment of Γ. Since no zero of g(λ) lies on Γ, that real value is
non-zero. Assuming it to be negative, g(λ) would have wrapped Γ once
about the origin, predicting exactly one zero λ0 of g(λ) inside the region
bounded by Γ. Since α and G are real, the zeros of g(λ) occur in complex
conjugate pairs, forcing λ0 to be real. This, however, is a contradiction
since the positivity of α shows g(λ) to have no real positive zeros. Thus,
the real value assumed by g(λ) along this last segment must be posi-
tive. Therefore, g(λ) does not encircle the origin. This completes the
proof.

Remarks
In studying the local stability of equation (9.1) with weak and strong
kernels, we applied the so-called linear chain trick to transform the scalar
intergrodiﬀerential equation into equivalent a system of ﬁrst order or-
dinary diﬀerential equations and obtained the characteristic equations
(9.7) and (9.12). It should be pointed out that these characteristic equa-
tions can be derived directly from the characteristic equation (9.18). If
G is a weak kernel, then (9.18) becomes
λ + r
 ∞

αe−(λ+α)sds = λ +

λ + α = 0,
which is equation (9.7). If G is a strong kernel, then (9.18) becomes

where a > 0, b ≥0, c ≥0, b+c ̸= 0. Stability and bifurcation of equation
(9.19) have been studied by many researchers. We refer to Miller (1966),
Cushing (1977a), MacDonald (1978) and references cited therein. See
Corollary 13.
It should be pointed out that bifurcations can occur in equation (9.19)
when other coeﬃcients (not necessarily the average delay) are chosen as
bifurcation parameters. For example, Landman (1980) showed that the
exists a positive a∗such that for a = a∗, a steady state becomes unstable
and oscillatory solutions bifurcate for a near a∗. See also Simpson (1980).
10.
Periodicity
If the environment is not temporally constant (e.g., seasonal eﬀects of
weather, food supplies, mating habits, etc.), then the parameters become
time dependent. It has been suggested by Nicholson (1933) that any
periodic change of climate tends to impose its period upon oscillations
of internal origin or to cause such oscillations to have a harmonic relation
to periodic climatic changes. Pianka (1974) discussed the relevance of
periodic environment to evolutionary theory.
10.1
Periodic Delay Models
Nisbet and Gurney (1976) considered a periodic delay logistic equa-
tion and carried out a numerical study of the inﬂuence of the periodicity
in r and K on the intrinsic oscillations of the equation such as those
caused by the time delay. Rosen (1987) noted the existence of a relation
between the period of the periodic carrying capacity and the delay of
the logistic equation. Zhang and Gopalsamy (1990) assumed that the
intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity are periodic functions
of a period ω and that the delay is an integer multiple of the period of
the environment. Namely, they considered the periodic delay diﬀerential
equation of the form
dx
dt = r(t)x(t)

1 −x(t −nω)
K(t)

,
(10.1)
where r(t + ω) = r(t), K(t + ω) = K(t) for all t ≥0. They proved the
following result on the existence of a unique positive periodic solution
of equation (10.1) which is globally attractive with respect to all other
positive solutions.

Then the periodic delay logistic equation ( 10.1) has a unique positive
solution x∗(t) and all other solutions of ( 10.1) corresponding to initial
conditions of the form
x(θ) = φ(θ) ≥0, φ(0) > 0; φ ∈C[−nω, 0]
satisfy
lim
t→∞|x(t) −x∗(t)| = 0.
(10.3)
Following the techniques of Zhang and Gopalsamy (1990), quite a few
papers have been produced by re-considering the delayed models which
appeared in the previous sections with the assumption that the coeﬃ-
cients are periodic. See, for example, the periodic Nicholson’s blowﬂies
model (3.1) (Saker and Agarwal (2002)), the periodic Allee eﬀect models
(4.1)(Lalli and Zhang (1994)) and (4.2) (Yan and Feng (2003)), the pe-
riodic food-limited model (5.3) (Gopalsamy et al. (1990a)), the periodic
Wazewska-Czyzewska and Lasota model (6.2) (Greaf et al. (1996)), etc.
In all these papers, the delays are assumed to be integral multiples of
periods of the environment. The coincidence degree theory (Gaines and
Mawhin (1977)) has also been used to establish the existence of peri-
odic solutions in periodic models with general periodic delays. However
uniqueness is not guaranteed and stability can be obtained only when
the delays are constant (Li (1998)).
Freedman and Wu (1992) considered the following single-species model
with a general periodic delay
dx
dt = x(t)[a(t) −b(t)x(t) + c(t)x(t −τ(t))],
(10.4)
where the net birth rate a(t) > 0, the self-inhibition rate b(t) > 0, the
reproduction rate c(t) ≥0, and the delay τ(t) ≥0 are continuously
diﬀerentiable, ω-periodic functions on (−∞, ∞). This model represents
the case that when the population size is small, growth is proportional
to the size, and when the population size is not so small, the positive
feedback is a(t) + c(t)x(t −τ(t)) while the negative feedback is b(t)x(t).
Such circumstance could arise when the resources are plentiful and the
reproduction at time t is by individuals of at least age τ(t) units of time.
Using ﬁxed point theorem and Razuminkin technique, they proved the
following theorem.
Theorem 11 Suppose that the equation
a(t) −b(t)K(t) + c(t)K(t −τ(t)) = 0
has a positive, ω-periodic, continuously diﬀerentiable solution K(t). Then
equation ( 10.4) has a positive ω-periodic solution Q(t). Moreover, if

b(t) > c(t)Q(t −τ(t))/Q(t) for all t ∈[0, ω], then Q(t) is globally as-
ymptotically stable with respect to positive solutions of ( 10.4).
Notice that in equation (10.4), b(t) has to be greater than zero. So
Theorem 11 does not apply to the periodic delay logistic equation

(10.5)
where τ(t) a positive periodic function. As Schley and Gourley (2000)
showed, the periodic delays can have either a stabilizing eﬀect or a desta-
bilizing one, depending on the frequency of the periodic perturbation.
It is still an open problem to study the dynamics, such as existence,
uniqueness and stability of periodic solutions and bifurcations, for the
periodic delay logistic equation (10.5).
10.2
Integrodiﬀerential Equations
Periodic logistic equations with distributed delay have been systemati-
cally studied in Cushing (1977a). Bardi and Schiaﬃno (1982) considered
the integrodiﬀerential equation (9.1) when the coeﬃcients are periodic,
that is,

where a > 0, b > 0, c ≥0 are ω-periodic continuous functions on R
and G ≥0 is a normalized kernel.
Let Cω = Cω(R, R) denote the
Banach space of all ω-periodic continuous functions endowed with the
usual supremum norm ∥x∥= sup |x(t)|. For a ∈Cω, deﬁne the average

Observe that an ω-periodic solution of (10.6) is a ﬁxed point of the
operator B : Γ →Cω deﬁned by

where Γ = {x ∈Cω :
⟨a −c(G ∗x)⟩> 0}. Since ⟨a⟩> 0, x(t) ≡0
belongs to Γ, that is, Γ is not empty. Deﬁne
u0(t) = (B0)(t).

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Claim I. If x1 and x2 belong to Γ with x1 ≤x2, then Bx2 ≤Bx1.
In fact, let αi(t) = a(t) −c(t)(G ∗xi)(t) and ui(t) = (Bxi)(t) for
t ∈R(i = 1, 2). Then α1(t) ≥α2(t). Since αi(t) = ˙ui(t)/ui(t) + b(t)ui(t),
we have ⟨αi⟩= ⟨bui⟩because ui(t)(i = 1, 2) are periodic.
Thus, we
deduce that ⟨bu1⟩≥⟨bu2⟩and for some t0 ∈R, u2(t0) ≤u1(t0). Setting
v(t) = u1(t) −u2(t), we have
˙v(t) ≥(α1(t) −b(t)(u1(t) + u2(t)))v(t),
which implies that v(t) ≥0 for all t ≥t0. By the periodicity of v(t), we
have Bx2 ≤Bx1.
Claim II. If v and c belong to Cω, then ⟨c(G ∗v)⟩= ⟨v(G ∗c)⟩.
In fact, if we deﬁne G(t) = 0 for t < 0, we have
⟨c(G ∗v)⟩

lim inf
t→∞(G ∗z)(t) ≥lim inf
t→∞z(t); lim sup
t→∞
(G ∗z)(t) ≤lim sup
t→∞

We only prove the ﬁrst inequality. Let l = lim inft→∞z(t). Choose
ϵ > 0 and pick tϵ such that z(t) > l −ϵ for any t > tϵ. If t > tϵ, we have

Hence,

which implies the ﬁrst inequality.
Claim IV. Let u ∈Γ and let v(t) > 0 be the solution of (10.6). Then
lim inf
t→∞(v(t) −u(t)) > 0 implies lim inf
t→∞((Bu)(t) −v(t)) > 0,
lim sup
t→∞
(v(t) −u(t)) < 0 implies lim sup
t→∞
(Bu)(t) −v(t)) < 0.

DDE in Single Species Dynamics

We prove the ﬁrst statement. Let w(t) = (Bu)(t), t ∈R. Then w(t)
is a solution of
˙w(t) = a(t)w(t) −b(t)w(t)2 −c(t)w(t)(G ∗u)(t)
while
˙v(t) = a(t)v(t) −b(t)v(t)2 −c(t)v(t)(G ∗v)(t).
Deﬁne z(t) = w(t) −v(t). Then
˙z(t)
=
(a(t) −b(t)w(t) −c(t)(G ∗u))z(t) + c(t)v(t)(G ∗(v −u))(t)
=
( ˙w(t)/w(t) −b(t)v(t))z(t) + c(t)v(t)(G ∗(v −u))(t).
Let l = lim inft→∞(v(t) −u(t)). Because of Claim III, there exists a
t0 ∈R, such that
˙z(t) > ( ˙w(t)/w(t) −b(t)v(t))z(t) + lc(t)v(t)/2
for all t > t0, that is,
z(t) > z(t0) exp{

where β =
˙w(t)/w(t) −b(t)v(t). Because
˙w(t)/w(t) is periodic and
its average is zero, b(t)v(t) is positive and bounded, we can see that
 t
t0 β(s)ds > γ1 −tγ2, where γ1 and γ2 > 0 are constants. Thus,
z(t) > γ3
 t
t0
exp((s −t)γ)ds = (γ3/γ)(1 −exp((t0 −t)γ2)),
where γ3 > 0 is a suitable constant. Then lim inft→∞z(t) ≥γ3/γ which
implies the ﬁrst statement.
Theorem 12 Suppose ⟨a⟩> 0. If
b(t) > (G ∗c)(t)
(10.7)
for any t ∈[0, ω], then equation ( 10.6) has a unique positive ω-periodic
solution x∗(t) which is globally asymptotically stable with respect to all
solutions of equation ( 10.6) under initial condition x(θ) = φ(θ), θ ∈
(−∞, 0], φ(0) > 0.
Proof. Since
˙u0(t)/u0(t) = a(t) −b(t)u0(t),
the periodicity of u0(t) and Claim II imply that ⟨a⟩= ⟨bu0⟩> ⟨c(G∗u0)⟩.
As u0 > 0, we have Bu0 ≤u0. Therefore, for any v ∈Cω satisfying

510
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
0 < v ≤u0, we have 0 < Bu0 ≤Bv ≤u0. Hence, the set Γ0 = {v ∈Cω :
0 < v ≤u0} ⊂Γ is invariant under B. Moreover,
Bu0 ≤Bv ≤u0 ⇒Bu0 ≤B2v ≤B2u0 ⇒B3u0 ≤B3v ≤B2u0
and by induction
B2n+1u0 ≤B2n+1v ≤B2nu0, B2n+1u0 ≤B2n+2v ≤B2n+2u0, n = 0, 1, 2, ...
Since 0 < B20 = Bu0, by Claim I, we know that {B2n+1u0} is in-
creasing and {B2nu0} is decreasing. Deﬁne
un(t) = (Bnu0)(t) = (Bun−1)(t).
Then
u−(t) = lim
n→∞u2n+1(t) and u+(t) = lim
n→∞u2n(t)
exist with 0 < u−(t) ≤u+(t). If we can show that u−(t) = u+(t) = u∗(t),
it is easy to see that u∗(t) is the unique ﬁxed point of B. By the deﬁnition,
we have
˙un(t) = (a(t) −c(t)(G ∗un−1)(t))un(t) −b(t)un(t)2.
By the monotonicity and uniform boundedness of {un} we have the
L2−convergence of both u2n+1 and u2n and their derivatives. Taking
the limits, we have
˙u−(t) = (a(t) −c(t)(G ∗u+)(t))u−(t) −b(t)u−(t)2,
˙u+(t) = (a(t) −c(t)(G ∗u−)(t))u+(t) −b(t)u+(t)2.
Dividing them by u−(t) and u+(t) respectively, we have
⟨a −c(G ∗u+) −bu−⟩= ⟨a −c(G ∗u−) −bu+⟩
followed by the fact that ln u+ and ln u−are periodic. Let v(t) = u+(t)−
u−(t). Then we have ⟨c(G ∗v)⟩= ⟨bv⟩. Now by Claim II we have ⟨c(G ∗
v)⟩= ⟨v(G ∗c)⟩. Hence, ⟨v(b −G ∗c)⟩= 0, which implies that v ≡0 by
the assumption (10.7). Therefore, u∗(t) is a unique periodic solution of
the equation (10.6).
To prove the global stability, ﬁrst we show that any solution v(t) of
equation (10.6) satisﬁes lim inft→∞v(t) > 0. In fact, we have
˙v(t) < a(t)v(t) −b(t)v(t)2
and
lim sup
t→∞
(v(t) −(Bu)(t)) ≤0.

DDE in Single Species Dynamics
511
Choose ϵ > 0 so that u(t) = u0(t) + ϵ ∈Γ. By Claim IV we have
lim inf
t→∞(v(t) −(Bu)(t)) ≥ϵ.
Since (Bu)(t) is strictly positive and periodic, we have lim inft→∞v(t) >
0. Thus, by Claim III, lim inft→∞(u0(t) −v(t)) > 0 and by induction,
lim inf
t→∞(v(t) −(B2n+1u0)(t)) > 0, lim sup
t→∞
(v(t) −(B2nu0)(t)) < 0.
Given ε > 0, choose n such that
u∗(t) −ε < (B2n+1u0)(t) < (B2nu0)(t) < u∗(t) + ε.
Since (B2n+1u0)(t) < v(t) < (B2nu0)(t) for large t, it follows that the
sequence {Bju} tends to u∗uniformly as j →∞.
If a, b and c are real positive constants, then condition (10.7) becomes
b > c. This is the main result in Miller (1966).
Corollary 13 If b > c and G satisﬁes the above assumptions, then the
positive equilibrium x∗= a/(b + c) of equation ( 9.19) (with constant
coeﬃcient) is globally stable with respect to positive solutions of ( 9.19).
For other related work on periodic logistic equations with distributed
delay, we refer to Bardi (1983), Cohen and Rosenblat (1982), Cushing
(1977a), Karakostas (1982) and the references therein.
11.
State-Dependent Delays
Let x(t) denote the size of a population at time t. Assume that the
number of births is a function of the population size only. The birth
rate is thus density dependent but not age dependent. Assume that the
lifespan L of individuals in the population is variable and is a function of
the current population size. If we take into account the crowding eﬀects,
then L(·) is a decreasing function of the population size.
Since the population size x(t) is equal to the total number of living
individuals, we have (B´elair (1991))
x(t) =
 t
t−L[x(t)]
b(x(s))ds.
(11.1)
Diﬀerentiating with respect to the time t on both sides of equation
(11.1) leads to a state-dependent delay model of the form
dx
dt =
b(x(t)) −b(x(t −L[x(t)])
1 −L′[x(t)] b(x(t −L[x(t)]).

Note that state-dependent delay equation (11.2) is not equivalent to
the integral equation (11.1). It is clear that every solution of (11.1) is
a solution of (11.2) but the reverse is not true. In fact, any constant
function is a solution of (11.2) but clearly it may not necessarily be a
solution of (11.1). The asymptotic behavior of the solutions of (11.2)
has been studied by B´elair (1991). See also Cooke and Huang (1996).
State-dependent delay models have also been introduced by Kirk et
al. (1970) to model the control of the bone marrow stem cell population
which supplies the circulating red blood cell population. See also Mackey
and Milton (1990).

(11.3)
has similar dynamics to the Hutchinson’s model (2.1).
Choose r =
0.15, K = 1.00 as in Fig. 11.3 for the Hutchinson’s model (2.1) and
τ(x) = a + bx2. We observe stability of the equilibrium x = K = 1 for
small amplitude of τ(x) and oscillations about the equilibrium for large
amplitude of τ(x) (see Fig. 11.16).
Recently, great attention has been paid on the study of state-dependent
delay equations. Consider
εx′(t) = −x(t) + f(x(t −r(x(t))))

the following theorem.
Theorem 14 Assume that f and r satisfy (H1)-(H2) or (H1′)-(H2′).
Suppose that f is in C1 near 0 and f′(0) = −k < −1. Let ν0, π/2 < ν0 <

Then for each λ > λ0 the equation

has an SOP solution xλ(t) such that −B < xλ(t) < A for all t.

Diﬀusive Models with Delay
Diﬀusion is a phenomenon by which a group of particles, for example
animals, bacteria, cells, chemicals and so on, spreads as a whole ac-
cording to the irregular motion of each particle. When this microscopic
irregular movement results in some macroscopic regular motion of the
group, the phenomenon is a diﬀusion process. In terms of randomness,
diﬀusion is deﬁned to be a basically irreversible phenomenon by which
particles spread out within a given space according to individual random
motion.

Fisher Equation
Let u(x, t) represent the population density at location x and time t
and the source term f represents the birth-death process. With the logis-
tic population growth f = ru(1−u/K) where r is the linear reproduction
rate and K the carrying capacity of the population, the one-dimensional
scalar reaction-diﬀusion equation takes the form (Fisher (1937) and Kol-
mogorov et al. (1937))

a < x < b, 0 ≤t < ∞,
(12.1)
which is called the Fisher equation or diﬀusive logistic equation. Fisher
(1937) proposed the model to investigate the spread of an advantageous
gene in a population.
Recall that for the spatially uniform logistic equation
∂u



,
the equilibrium u = 0 is unstable while the positive equilibrium u = K is
globally stable. How does the introduction of the diﬀusion aﬀect these
conclusions?
The answer depends on the domain and the boundary
conditions. (a) In a ﬁnite domain with zero-ﬂux (Neumann) boundary
conditions, the conclusions still hold (Fife (1979) and Britton (1986)).
(b) Under the Dirichlet conditions, u = K is no longer a solution to the
problem. In this case the behaviour of solutions depends on the size of
the domain. When the domain is small, u = 0 is asymptotically stable,
but it losses its stability when the domain exceeds a certain size and a
non-trivial steady-state solution becomes asymptotically stable. (c) In
an inﬁnite domain the Fisher equation has travelling wave solutions (see
Figure 11.17).

Recently, researchers have studied the combined eﬀects of diﬀusion
and various delays on the dynamics of the models mentioned in previous
sections. For example, for the food-limited model (5.3) with diﬀusion,
Gourley and Chaplain (2002) considered the case when the delay is ﬁnite.

DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Feng and Lu (2003) assumed that the time delay in an integral multiple
of the period of the environment and considered the existence of periodic
solutions. Davidson and Gourley (2001) studied the model with inﬁnite
delay, and Gourley and So (2002) investigated the dynamics when the
delay is nonlocal.

∂u
∂t = d∆u −τu(x, t) + βτu(x, t −1) exp[−u(x, t −1)]

of the equation. Some numerical and bifurcation analysis of this model
has been carried out by So, Wu and Yang (1999) and So and Zou (2001).

Introduction
Consider the following inhomogeneous non-autonomous retarded dif-
ferential equation
(IRDE)

x′(t)
=
Ax(t) + L(t)xt + f(t),
t ≥s,
x(τ)
=
ϕ(τ −s),
τ ∈[s −r, s],
where A is a linear (unbounded) operator on a Banach space E, (L(t))t≥0
is a family of bounded linear operators from the space C([−r, 0], E)
into E, f : IR+ −→E, and xt is the function deﬁned on [−r, 0] by
xt(θ) = x(t + θ), θ ∈[−r, 0].
The equation (IRDE) has attracted many authors, and has been
treated by using diﬀerent techniques and methods, we cite, for instance,
[1, 3, 44, 63, 64, 105, 226, 227, 253]. In these papers, it has been stud-
ied the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous autonomous retarded dif-
ferential equations (IRDE) (L(t) ≡L).
It has been also studied the
asymptotic behaviour and the regularity properties of the solutions of
homogeneous retarded equations (HRDE) (f ≡0) as well as the asymp-
totic behaviour of the solutions of the inhomogeneous equations with
respect to the inhomogeneous term f.
To proﬁt from the big development of the semigroup theory and its
tools (as the perturbation technique), many authors thought to trans-
form the retarded equation (IRDE) to an abstract Cauchy problem (un-

The ﬁrst remark that one can do is that X0 := D(A) = {0}×C([−r, 0], E)
̸= X, which means that the operator A is not densely deﬁned. One re-
marks also that the ranges of the perturbation operators B(t), t ≥0,
and the values of the inhomogeneous term

, t ≥0, are not in
X0. Hence, one cannot use the standard theory of semigroups to solve
neither the perturbation problem (CP)0 nor the inhomogeneous Cauchy
problem (CP)f.
H. R. Thieme [224], has showed the existence of mild solutions of the
inhomogeneous autonomous Cauchy problem (CP)f, and then the ones
of the inhomogeneous autonomous retarded equations, by the introduc-
tion of a new variation of constants formula.
To study the well-posedness of the homogeneous non-autonomous re-
tarded diﬀerential equations (HRDE), A. Rhandi [199] has proposed the
use of the so-called extrapolation theory, introduced by R. Nagel [63].
Using the extrapolation theory, we have also treated, with A. Rhandi,
[178] the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous autonomous retarded
equations and, together with A. B´atkai, [17], we studied the regular-
ity of the solutions to the homogeneous autonomous equations. With B.
Amir [8, 9, 10], also using the extrapolation theory, we have studied the
asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the inhomogeneous autonomous
retarded equations. Usually by the extrapolation theory, G. G¨uhring,
F. R¨abiger and R. Schnaubelt have studied [55, 92, 94, 93] the well-
posedness and the asymptotic behaviour of the general inhomogeneous
non-autonomous retarded equations (IRDE).
Our contribution in this book consists in the study of the well-
posedeness, the regularity and the asymptotic behaviour of the solu-

tions of the homogeneous non-autonomous retarded diﬀerential equa-
tions (HRDE), using the extrapolation theory. Our document is orga-
nized as follows:
In section 2, we recall some deﬁnitions and important results from the
extrapolation theory. More precisely, we deﬁne the extrapolation spaces
and the extrapolated semigroups for Hille-Yosida operators, introduced
by R. Nagel [63], and present some of their important properties. At
the end, we present a perturbation of Hille-Yosida operators result, the
result is shown in [187, 199].
Section 3 is devoted to the application of the above abstract results, to
study the homogeneous non-autonomous retarded diﬀerential equations
(HRDE). We study the existence of solutions, and that these solutions
are given by Dyson-Phillips expansions and satisfy variation of constants
formulas. These last results will be crucial to study the regularity and
the asymptotic properties of these solutions.

Preliminaries
In this section we introduce the extrapolation spaces and extrapolated
semigroups and give all needed abstract results of the extrapolation the-
ory, e.g., perturbation results. For more details we refer to the book
[63] and [17, 186]. The extrapolation theory was introduced by R. Nagel
[63, 186], and was successfully used in these last years for many purposes,
see e.g., [6], [8], [92], [178], [186], [190], [199], [200] and [201].
We recall that a linear operator (A, D(A)) on a Banach space X is
called a Hille-Yosida operator if there are constants M ≥1 and w ∈R
such that
(w, ∞) ⊂ρ(A) and ∥(λ−w)nR(λ, A)n∥≤M
for all λ > w and n ∈N.
(2.1)
From the Hille-Yosida theorem, we have (cf. [109, Thm. 12.2.4]) the fol-
lowing result.
Proposition 1 Let (A, D(A)) be a Hille-Yosida operator on a Banach
space X. Then, the part (A0, D(A0)) of A in X0 := (D(A), ∥· ∥) given
The regularity results, presented in this section, have been also shown
by many authors, using alternative diﬀerent techniques, see, e.g., [1],
[105], [226], [227] and [253], but the results concerning the asymptotic
behaviour are in our knowledge new.

generates a C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 on X0. Moreover, we have ρ(A) =
ρ(A0) and (λ−A0)−1 is the restriction of (λ−A)−1 to X0 for λ ∈ρ(A).
Notice that Hille-Yosida operators on reﬂexive Banach spaces are
densely deﬁned.
Proposition 2 Let (A, D(A)) be a Hille-Yosida operator on a reﬂexive
Banach space X. Then D(A) is dense in X and hence A generates a
C0-semigroup .
As an immediate consequence of Proposition 2, we have
Corollary 3 Let (A, D(A)) be the generator of a C0-semigroup (T(t))t≥0
on a reﬂexive Banach space X.
Then (A∗, D(A∗)) generates the C0-
semigroup (T ∗(t))t≥0 on X∗.
From now on, (A, D(A)) will be a Hille-Yosida operator on a Banach
space X. We deﬁne on X0 the norm
∥x∥−1 := ∥R(λ0, A0)x∥,
x ∈X0,
for a ﬁxed λ0 > ω. From the resolvent equation it is easy to see that
diﬀerent λ ∈ρ(A) yield equivalent norms. The completion X−1 of X0
with respect to ∥· ∥−1 is called the extrapolation space. The extrapolated
semigroup (T−1(t))t≥0 is the unique continuous extension of (T0(t))t≥0
to X−1, since
∥T0(t)x∥−1 = ∥T0(t)R(λ0, A0)x∥≤Meωt∥x∥−1,
t ≥0, x ∈X0.
It is strongly continuous and we denote by (A−1, D(A−1)) its generator.
We have the following properties (see [186, Prop. 1.3, Thm. 1.4]).
Theorem 4 We have the following:
(a) ∥T−1(t)∥L(X−1) = ∥T0(t)∥L(X0), t ≥0.
(b) D(A−1) = X0.
(c) A−1 : X0 →X−1 is the unique continuous extension of A0.
(d) X is continuously embedded in X−1 and R(λ, A−1) is an extension
of R(λ, A) for λ ∈ρ(A−1) = ρ(A).

(e) A0 and A are the parts of A−1 in X0 and X, respectively.
(f) R(λ0, A−1)X0 = D(A0).
The following result, concerning the convolutions of (T−1(t))t≥0 and
X-valued locally integrable functions, is one of the fundamental results
of the extrapolation theory, and is the key to show the next theorem.
For the proof, see [63].

The function [0, +∞) ∋t −→

We end this section by a non-autonomous perturbation result of Hille-
Yosida operators, due to A. Rhandi [199]. For the aim of this document,
we need only a particular version of this result.
First, recall that a family (U(t, s))t≥s≥0 of bounded linear operators
on X is called evolution family if
(a) U(t, r)U(r, s) = U(t, s) and U(s, s) = Id for t ≥r ≥s ≥0 and
(b) {(t, s) : t ≥s ≥0} ∋(t, s) →U(t, s)x is continuous for all x ∈X.
Consider now a perturbation family B(·) ∈Cb(R+, Ls(X0, X)), i.e.,
B(t) ∈L(X0, X) for all t ≥0, and t −→B(t)x is a bounded continuous
function on IR+ for all x ∈X0.
For all t ≥0, let C(t) denote the part of the perturbed operator
A + B(t) in X0. By deﬁnition, the operator C(t) is deﬁned by
C(t) = A + B(t),
D(C(t)) = {x ∈D(A) : Ax + B(t)x ∈X0}.
The proof of the following perturbation result relies on the fundamen-
tal Proposition 5.

converges in the uniform operator topology of L(X0) uniformly on com-
pact subsets of {(t, s) : t ≥s ≥0} and deﬁnes an evolution family on
X0, satisfying
∥U(t, s)∥≤Me(ω+Mc)(t−s)
(2.5)
for t ≥s ≥0 and c := supτ≥0 ∥B(τ)∥L(X0,X).
In addition, (U(t, s))t≥s≥0 satisﬁes the variation of constants formula
U(t, s)x = T0(t−s)x+
 t
s
T−1(t−σ)B(σ)U(σ, s)x dσ,
x ∈X0, t ≥s ≥0.
(2.6)
Moreover, if t −→B(t)x is diﬀerentiable on IR+ for all x ∈X0 then,
for all x ∈D(C(s)), t −→U(t, s)x is diﬀerentiable on [s, ∞), U(t, s)x ∈
D(C(t)) and
d
dtU(t, s)x = (A + B(t))U(t, s)x
for all t ≥s.
In this case we say that the evolution family is generated by the family
(C(t), D(C(t)))t≥0.
In the autonomous case, B(t) ≡B, the operator
C = A + B,
D(C) = {x ∈D(A) : Ax + Bx ∈X0}
(2.7)
generates a C0-semigroup (S(t))t≥0, see [187, Thm. 4.1.5]. From Theo-

Homogeneous Retarded Diﬀerential
Equations
In this section we apply the extrapolation results from the previous
section to solve the homogeneous retarded diﬀerential equations
(HRDE)
 x′(t) = Ax(t) + L(t)xt,
t ≥s,
xs = ϕ,
and study the regularity and the asymptotic behaviour of their solutions.
Here, A is a Hille-Yosida operator on a Banach space E.
Let S :=
(S0(t))t≥0 the C0-semigroup generated by the part of A in E0 := D(A),
and (S−1(t))t≥0 its extrapolated semigroup.
(L(t))t≥0 is a family of
bounded linear operators from Cr := C([−r, 0], E0) to E.
By a (classical) solution of (HRDE), we design a continuously dif-
ferentiable function x : [−r, +∞) −→E0, which satisﬁes the equation
(HRDE), and by a mild solution a continuous function x : [−r, +∞) −→
E0, satisfying
x(t) =

an equivalent Cauchy problem on the product Banach space X := E×Cr

Before showing the equivalence of (HRDE) and (CP)0, we study the
well-posedness of the last Cauchy problem (CP)0. To do this, we write
the operator A(t) as the sum of the operator

As we have remarked at the introduction, X0 := D(A) = {0} × Cr which
means that the operator A is not densely deﬁned. For this reason, we
propose to use the extrapolation theory to study the well-posedness of
the Cauchy problem (CP)0.
To this purpose, we need to show that the operator A is of Hille-
Yosida. This result has been shown in [199] when A generates a C0-
semigroup.
Lemma 7 The operator A is of Hille-Yosida and

(3.2)
for all τ ∈[−r, 0], y ∈E, g ∈Cr and n ≥1.
Proof. From the equation (λ −A)( 0
ϕ1 ) = ( y
g ) on the space X, we
have
ϕ1(τ) = eλτϕ1(0) +
 0
τ
eλ(τ−σ)g(σ) dσ,
τ ∈[−r, 0],
and
Aϕ1(0) −ϕ′

We conclude that
ϕ1(τ) = eλτR(λ, A)[y + g(0)] +
 0
τ
eλ(τ−σ)g(σ) dσ,
τ ∈[−r, 0].
It is clear that the function ϕ1 belongs to Cr, and the relation (3.2) is
satisﬁed for n = 1. By induction, we obtain
ϕn(τ) =

Since A is a Hille-Yosida operator, it follows that

and it generates a C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0, by Proposition 1. It is clear
then that the operator

In the following proposition, we give the correspondence between the
mild solutions of the retarded equation (HRDE) and those of the Cauchy
problem (CP)0.
Proposition 9 Let ϕ ∈Cr and s ≥0, we have:

is the mild solution of (HRDE), i.e., x satisﬁes (3.1).
Moreover, it
satisﬁes
U(t, s)ϕ = xt(·, s, ϕ),

Proof. Let τ ∈[−r, 0] and ϕ ∈Cr. From the extrapolation results, the
variation of constants formula (3.7) and the deﬁnition of (T0(t))t≥0, we
have

x(t, s, ϕ) :=

Hence,
x(t, s, ϕ) = S0(t −s)ϕ(0) +
 t−s

S−1(t −σ)L(σ)U(σ, s)ϕdσ.
From the equality (3.12), one can obtain easily the relation (3.11).
Thus, this implies that x(·, s, ϕ) satisﬁes (3.1), and the assertion (i) is
proved. The assertion (ii) can also be deduced from the above relations.
In the particular case of autonomous retarded diﬀerential equations,
i.e. L(t) = L for all t ≥0, we have the following theorem. The part (a)
has been obtained also by many authors, e.g., [1], [63], [105] and [253].

generates a strongly continuous C0-semigroup T := (T(t))t≥0 on the
space Cr.
Moreover, one has:
(i) the solution x of (HRDE) is given by
x(t) :=

ϕ(t),
−r ≤t ≤0,
T(t)ϕ(0),
t ≥0.
(3.13)
(ii) If x is the solution of (HRDE), the semigroup T is given by
T(t)ϕ = xt
for all ϕ ∈Cr and t ≥0.
(b) The semigroup T is also given by the Dyson-Phillips series
T(t) =

for all ϕ ∈Cr and n ≥1, t ≥0.
Proof. The part of A + B in X0 = {0} × Cr is the operator given by
(A + B)/X0 =

.
From Section 2, the operator (A + B)/X0 generates a C0-semigroup T :=
(T (t))t≥0. Hence, from the form of (A + B)/X0, one can see that the
operator (AL, D(AL)) generates also a C0-semigroup T := (T(t))t≥0 on
Cr, and
T (t) =

From this and Lemma 7, one can see easily as in the non-autonomous
case that

 t

T0(t −s)eλ·λR(λ, A)LTn−1(s)ϕ ds,

Thus, we obtain the relation (3.14). The assertions (i)-(ii) are particular
cases of Proposition 9.
The Dyson-Phillips series obtained in the above theorem will be now
used to study the regularity properties of the semigroup T solution of the
retarded equation (HRDE). As, the terms Tn of the series, see (3.14),
are convolutions between the extrapolated semigroup (S−1(t))t≥0 and
E-valued functions, to get our aim, we need the following results.
Lemma 11 [17] Let G ∈C(IR+, Ls(Cr)). Then,
(i)
If {t : t > 0} ∋t →S0(t) ∈L(E0) is continuous (or S is
immediately norm continuous) then {t : t > 0} ∋t −→
 t
0 S−1(t −
s)LG(s) ds ∈L(Cr, E0) is continuous.
(ii) If the operator S0(t) is compact for all t > 0 (or S is immediately
compact) then the operator
 t
0
S−1(t −s)LG(s) ds
deﬁned from Cr to E0 is compact for all t ≥0.
Now, we can announce the following regularity results, showed also,
for instance, in [1], [63] and [253].
Theorem 12 (i) If S is immediately norm continuous then {t : t >
r} ∋t →T(t) ∈L(Cr) is also a continuous function.
(ii) If S is immediately compact then T(t) is also compact for all t > r.

Extrapolation theory for DDE
533
Proof. By the deﬁnition of the semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 it is easy to
show that t →T0(t) is norm continuous for t > r if we consider (i), and
that the operator T0(t) is compact for all t > r in the case of (ii).
Assume that S is immediately norm continuous. From the relations
(3.14) and Lemma 11 (i), the function IR+ ∋t →Tn(t) ∈L(Cr) is
continuous for all n ≥1. We have seen in Theorem 10 that
T(t) =
∞

n=0
Tn(t) = T0(t) +
∞

n=1
Tn(t),
t ≥0,
(3.15)
and that this series converge in L(Cr) uniformly in compact intervals of
IR+. Hence, the assertion (i) is obtained.
Treat now the assertion (ii). Let t > 0 and n ≥1. From Lemma 11,
we have that
 t+θ
0
S−1(t + θ −s)LTn−1(s) ds
is a compact operator from Cr to E0 for all t + θ ≥0, and then Tn(t)(θ)
is also a compact operator from Cr to E0 for all θ ∈[−r, 0].
By [63, Theorem II.4.29], we have also that S is immediately norm
continuous. Hence, by Lemma 11 (i), the set of functions {θ →
 t+θ
0
S−1(t+
θ−s)LTn−1(s)ϕ ds
ϕ in some bounded set of Cr} is equicontinuous, and
then the subset {θ →Tn(t)(θ)
ϕ in some bounded set of Cr} of Cr is
equicontinuous.
The compactness of Tn(t) for all t > 0 and n ≥1
follows ﬁnally from Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Consequently, as the series
(3.15) converges in the uniform operator topology of Cr, we obtain the
second assertion.
We end this section by studying the robustness of the asymptotic be-
haviour of the solutions to non-autonomous retarded equation (HRDE)
with respect to the term retard.
More precisely, we show that the
solution of (HRDE) IR+ ∋t −→x(t) has the same asymptotic be-
haviour, e.g., boundedness, asymptotic almost periodicity, as the map
IR+ ∋t −→S0(t)ϕ(0).
First, let us recall the following deﬁnitions:
For a function f ∈BUC(IR+, X0), the space of bounded and uni-
formly continuous functions from IR+ into X0, the set of all translates,
called the hull of f, is H(f) := {f(· + t) : t ∈IR+}.
The function f is said to be asymptotically almost periodic if H(f) is
relatively compact in BUC(IR+, X0), and Eberlein weakly asymptotically
almost periodic if H(f) is weakly relatively compact in BUC(IR+, X0),
see [129] for more details.

534
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
A closed subspace E of BUC(IR+, X0) is said to be translation bi-
invariant if for all t ≥0
f ∈E ⇐⇒f(· + t) ∈E,
and operator invariant if M ◦f ∈E for every f ∈E and M ∈L(X0),
where M ◦f is deﬁned by (M ◦f)(t) = M(f(t)), t ≥0.
The closed subspace E is said to be homogeneous if it is translation
bi-invariant and operator invariant.
For our purpose, we assume that:
(H1) the C0-semigroup (S0(t))t≥0 is of contraction,
(H2) there exist s0 ≥0 and a constant 0 ≤q < 1 such that
 ∞
0
||L(s + t)T0(t)ϕ||dt ≤q||ϕ|| for all ϕ ∈Cr and s ≥s0.
(3.16)
Under the above hypotheses, we have the following results.
Proposition 13 (i) For all ϕ ∈Cr, n ∈N and t ≥s ≥s0
 +∞
s
∥L(σ)Un(σ, s)ϕ∥dσ ≤qn+1∥ϕ∥
(3.17)
and
∥Un(t, s)ϕ∥≤qn∥ϕ∥.
(3.18)
(ii) The series (3.8) converges uniformly on all the set {(t, s) : t ≥s ≥
s0}. Moreover, the evolution family (U(t, s))t≥s≥0 is uniformly bounded
and
||U(t, s)|| ≤
1
1 −q
for all t ≥s ≥s0.
Proof.
Let ϕ ∈Cr and t ≥s ≥s0. For n = 0, the estimate (3.17) is only
our assumption (3.16). Suppose now that the estimate holds for n −1.
From the relation (3.8), by using Fubini’s theorem we have

Hence, from (H1), the inequality (3.16) and the induction hypothesis

s
||L(σ)Un(σ, s)ϕ||dσ ≤q
 t
s
∥L(τ)Un−1(τ, s)ϕ||dτ

and this gives the estimate (3.17).
The inequality (3.18) follows also from (H1), the relation (3.8) and
the ﬁrst estimate (3.17).
The assertion (ii) follows then by this estimate (3.18).
In the above proposition we obtain the boundedness of the evolution
family (U(t, s))t≥s≥0, and thus from (3.13), the boundedness of the mild
solution of (HRDE) is also obtained. To obtain the asymptotic almost
periodicity, and other asymptotic properties of this mild solution we
need the following Lemma.
Lemma 14 Let g ∈L1(IR+, E). If t −→T0(t)ϕ belongs to E for all
ϕ ∈Cr then the function
IR+ ∋t −→T0 ∗g(t) := lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)g(τ)dτ
belongs to E.
Proof. For g ∈L1(IR+, E), since (T0(t))t≥0 is bounded, it is clear that
!!!! lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)g(τ)dτ
!!!! ≤C∥g∥L1,

536
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
which implies that for every g ∈L1(IR+, E), T0∗g ∈BC(IR+, Cr) and the
linear operator g −→T0∗g is bounded from L1(IR+, E) into BC(IR+, Cr),
the space of all bounded continuous functions. By this boundedness, the
linearity and the density, it is suﬃcient to show this result for simple
functions. Let g := 1(a,b) ⊗x, b ≥a ≥0, x ∈E and t ≥0. We have,
T0 ∗g(t + b) = lim
λ→∞
 b
a
T0(t + b −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)x dτ
= T0(t) lim
λ→∞
 b
a
T0(b −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)x dτ.
Hence, since E is translation bi-invariant and t −→T0(t)ϕ belongs to
E for every ϕ ∈Cr, we conclude that T0 ∗g(·) ∈E, and this achieve the
proof.
We can now state the following main asymptotic behaviour result.
Theorem 15 Assume that (H1) and (H2) hold. If t −→T0(t)ϕ be-
longs to E for all ϕ ∈Cr, and the condition ( 3.16) is satisﬁed then, the
Cr-valued function IR+ ∋t −→xt+s(·, s, ϕ) is also in E for all ϕ ∈Cr
and s ≥0, where x(·, s, ϕ) is the mild solution of (HRDE).
Proof. From Proposition 9 and the relation (3.11), we have
xt+s(·, s, ϕ) = T0(t)ϕ+ lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −σ)eλ·λR(λ, A)L(s + σ)U(s + σ, s)ϕ dσ,
t ≥0.
(3.19)
As t −→T0(t)ϕ belongs to E, it is suﬃcient to that the function f from
IR+ to Cr
f(t) := lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −σ)eλ·λR(λ, A)L(s + σ)U(s + σ, s)ϕ dσ,
t ≥0
belongs to E as well. Furthermore, by Lemma 14, it is suﬃcient to show
that the function g(·) := L(·+ s)U(·+ s, s)ϕ belongs to L1(IR+, E), and
this follows from (3.8) and the estimate (3.17) for all s ≥s0. Hence,
the function IR+ ∋t −→xt+s(·, s, ϕ) = U(t + s, s)ϕ belongs to E for all
s ≥s0 and ϕ ∈Cr.
For all s ≥0 and t ≥0, one can write
U(t + s0 + s, s)ϕ = U(t + s + s0, s + s0)U(s + s0, s)ϕ.
As s + s0 ≥s0, then as shown above t −→U(t + s0 + s, s + s0)ϕ belongs
to E and by the translation bi-invariance of E, t −→xt+s(·, s, ϕ) =
U(t + s, s)ϕ belongs to E. This achieves the proof.

537
The C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 is given in terms of the C0-semigroup
(S0(t))t≥0, then we can hope that they have the same asymptotic be-
haviour. In the following lemma, we present some particular commune
asymptotic behaviours to these two semigroups.
Lemma 16 Let ϕ ∈Cr. Assume that the map IR+ ∋t −→S0(t)ϕ(0) is
(1) vanishing at inﬁnity, or
(2) asymptotically almost periodic, or
(3) uniformly ergodic, i.e., the limit lim
α→0+ α

t→+∞
1
t
 t
0
eiθsS0(·+
s)ϕ(0) ds exists in BUC(IR+, E0) for all θ ∈IR.
Then, the function IR+ ∋t −→T0(t)ϕ has the same property in
BUC(IR+, Cr).
Proof.
As (S0(t))t≥0 is a contraction semigroup, we have for all t > r and
θ ∈[−r, 0]
∥(T0(t)ϕ)(θ)∥= ∥S0(t + θ)ϕ(0)∥= ∥S0(r + θ)S0(t −r)ϕ(0)∥
≤∥S0(t −r)ϕ(0)∥.
If one has (1), then ∥T0(t)ϕ∥−→0, when t →∞.
Assume now that we have (2). By the deﬁnition of asymptotic almost
periodicity, see [7], for every ε > 0 there is l(ε) > 0 and K ≥0 such that
each interval of length l(ε) contains a τ for which this inequality
||S0(t + τ)ϕ(0) −S0(t)ϕ(0)|| ≤ε
holds for all t, t + τ ≥K. Let now t > K + r. Then, one has
∥(T0(t + τ)ϕ)(θ) −(T0(t)ϕ)(θ)∥= ∥S0(t + θ + τ)ϕ(0) −S0(t + θ)ϕ(0)∥
≤∥S0(t −r + τ)ϕ(0) −S0(t −r)ϕ(0)∥
< ε
for all θ ∈[−r, 0],
and this means that T0(·)ϕ is asymptotically almost periodic.
The assertions (3) and (4) can be showed by the same technique.
As the classes of functions (1)-(4) are particular homogeneous closed
subspaces of BUC(IR+, Cr), see [22], by Theorem 15 and Lemma 16, we
have the following corollary.
Corollary 17 Assume that (H1) and (H2) hold and that for all ϕ ∈Cr
the function

538
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
IR+ ∋t −→S0(t)ϕ(0) belongs to one of the classes (1)-(4) of Lemma
16. Then, for all ϕ ∈Cr, the mild solution x(·, 0, ϕ) of (HRDE) belongs
to the same class.

Introduction
Consider the following inhomogeneous non-autonomous retarded dif-
ferential equation
(IRDE)

x′(t)
=
Ax(t) + L(t)xt + f(t),
t ≥s,
x(τ)
=
ϕ(τ −s),
τ ∈[s −r, s],
where A is a linear (unbounded) operator on a Banach space E, (L(t))t≥0
is a family of bounded linear operators from the space C([−r, 0], E)
into E, f : IR+ −→E, and xt is the function deﬁned on [−r, 0] by
xt(θ) = x(t + θ), θ ∈[−r, 0].
The equation (IRDE) has attracted many authors, and has been
treated by using diﬀerent techniques and methods, we cite, for instance,
[1, 3, 44, 63, 64, 105, 226, 227, 253]. In these papers, it has been stud-
ied the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous autonomous retarded dif-
ferential equations (IRDE) (L(t) ≡L).
It has been also studied the
asymptotic behaviour and the regularity properties of the solutions of
homogeneous retarded equations (HRDE) (f ≡0) as well as the asymp-
totic behaviour of the solutions of the inhomogeneous equations with
respect to the inhomogeneous term f.
To proﬁt from the big development of the semigroup theory and its
tools (as the perturbation technique), many authors thought to trans-
form the retarded equation (IRDE) to an abstract Cauchy problem (un-

The ﬁrst remark that one can do is that X0 := D(A) = {0}×C([−r, 0], E)

marks also that the ranges of the perturbation operators B(t), t ≥0,

, t ≥0, are not in
X0. Hence, one cannot use the standard theory of semigroups to solve
neither the perturbation problem (CP)0 nor the inhomogeneous Cauchy
problem (CP)f.
H. R. Thieme [224], has showed the existence of mild solutions of the
inhomogeneous autonomous Cauchy problem (CP)f, and then the ones
of the inhomogeneous autonomous retarded equations, by the introduc-
tion of a new variation of constants formula.
To study the well-posedness of the homogeneous non-autonomous re-
tarded diﬀerential equations (HRDE), A. Rhandi [199] has proposed the
use of the so-called extrapolation theory, introduced by R. Nagel [63].
Using the extrapolation theory, we have also treated, with A. Rhandi,
[178] the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous autonomous retarded
equations and, together with A. B´atkai, [17], we studied the regular-
ity of the solutions to the homogeneous autonomous equations. With B.
Amir [8, 9, 10], also using the extrapolation theory, we have studied the
asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the inhomogeneous autonomous
retarded equations. Usually by the extrapolation theory, G. G¨uhring,
F. R¨abiger and R. Schnaubelt have studied [55, 92, 94, 93] the well-
posedness and the asymptotic behaviour of the general inhomogeneous
non-autonomous retarded equations (IRDE).
Our contribution in this book consists in the study of the well-
posedeness, the regularity and the asymptotic behaviour of the solu-

tions of the homogeneous non-autonomous retarded diﬀerential equa-
tions (HRDE), using the extrapolation theory. Our document is orga-
nized as follows:
In section 2, we recall some deﬁnitions and important results from the
extrapolation theory. More precisely, we deﬁne the extrapolation spaces
and the extrapolated semigroups for Hille-Yosida operators, introduced
by R. Nagel [63], and present some of their important properties. At
the end, we present a perturbation of Hille-Yosida operators result, the
result is shown in [187, 199].
Section 3 is devoted to the application of the above abstract results, to
study the homogeneous non-autonomous retarded diﬀerential equations
(HRDE). We study the existence of solutions, and that these solutions
are given by Dyson-Phillips expansions and satisfy variation of constants
formulas. These last results will be crucial to study the regularity and
the asymptotic properties of these solutions.

Preliminaries
In this section we introduce the extrapolation spaces and extrapolated
semigroups and give all needed abstract results of the extrapolation the-
ory, e.g., perturbation results. For more details we refer to the book
[63] and [17, 186]. The extrapolation theory was introduced by R. Nagel
[63, 186], and was successfully used in these last years for many purposes,
see e.g., [6], [8], [92], [178], [186], [190], [199], [200] and [201].
We recall that a linear operator (A, D(A)) on a Banach space X is
called a Hille-Yosida operator if there are constants M ≥1 and w ∈R
such that
(w, ∞) ⊂ρ(A) and ∥(λ−w)nR(λ, A)n∥≤M
for all λ > w and n ∈N.
(2.1)
From the Hille-Yosida theorem, we have (cf. [109, Thm. 12.2.4]) the fol-
lowing result.
Proposition 1 Let (A, D(A)) be a Hille-Yosida operator on a Banach
space X. Then, the part (A0, D(A0)) of A in X0 := (D(A), ∥· ∥) given
The regularity results, presented in this section, have been also shown
by many authors, using alternative diﬀerent techniques, see, e.g., [1],
[105], [226], [227] and [253], but the results concerning the asymptotic
behaviour are in our knowledge new.

generates a C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 on X0. Moreover, we have ρ(A) =
ρ(A0) and (λ−A0)−1 is the restriction of (λ−A)−1 to X0 for λ ∈ρ(A).
Notice that Hille-Yosida operators on reﬂexive Banach spaces are
densely deﬁned.
Proposition 2 Let (A, D(A)) be a Hille-Yosida operator on a reﬂexive
Banach space X. Then D(A) is dense in X and hence A generates a
C0-semigroup .
As an immediate consequence of Proposition 2, we have
Corollary 3 Let (A, D(A)) be the generator of a C0-semigroup (T(t))t≥0
on a reﬂexive Banach space X.
Then (A∗, D(A∗)) generates the C0-
semigroup (T ∗(t))t≥0 on X∗.
From now on, (A, D(A)) will be a Hille-Yosida operator on a Banach
space X. We deﬁne on X0 the norm
∥x∥−1 := ∥R(λ0, A0)x∥,
x ∈X0,
for a ﬁxed λ0 > ω. From the resolvent equation it is easy to see that
diﬀerent λ ∈ρ(A) yield equivalent norms. The completion X−1 of X0
with respect to ∥· ∥−1 is called the extrapolation space. The extrapolated
semigroup (T−1(t))t≥0 is the unique continuous extension of (T0(t))t≥0
to X−1, since
∥T0(t)x∥−1 = ∥T0(t)R(λ0, A0)x∥≤Meωt∥x∥−1,
t ≥0, x ∈X0.
It is strongly continuous and we denote by (A−1, D(A−1)) its generator.
We have the following properties (see [186, Prop. 1.3, Thm. 1.4]).
Theorem 4 We have the following:
(a) ∥T−1(t)∥L(X−1) = ∥T0(t)∥L(X0), t ≥0.
(b) D(A−1) = X0.
(c) A−1 : X0 →X−1 is the unique continuous extension of A0.
(d) X is continuously embedded in X−1 and R(λ, A−1) is an extension
of R(λ, A) for λ ∈ρ(A−1) = ρ(A).

(e) A0 and A are the parts of A−1 in X0 and X, respectively.
(f) R(λ0, A−1)X0 = D(A0).
The following result, concerning the convolutions of (T−1(t))t≥0 and
X-valued locally integrable functions, is one of the fundamental results
of the extrapolation theory, and is the key to show the next theorem.
For the proof, see [63].

(ii)
The function [0, +∞) ∋t −→

We end this section by a non-autonomous perturbation result of Hille-
Yosida operators, due to A. Rhandi [199]. For the aim of this document,
we need only a particular version of this result.
First, recall that a family (U(t, s))t≥s≥0 of bounded linear operators
on X is called evolution family if
(a) U(t, r)U(r, s) = U(t, s) and U(s, s) = Id for t ≥r ≥s ≥0 and
(b) {(t, s) : t ≥s ≥0} ∋(t, s) →U(t, s)x is continuous for all x ∈X.
Consider now a perturbation family B(·) ∈Cb(R+, Ls(X0, X)), i.e.,
B(t) ∈L(X0, X) for all t ≥0, and t −→B(t)x is a bounded continuous
function on IR+ for all x ∈X0.
For all t ≥0, let C(t) denote the part of the perturbed operator
A + B(t) in X0. By deﬁnition, the operator C(t) is deﬁned by
C(t) = A + B(t),
D(C(t)) = {x ∈D(A) : Ax + B(t)x ∈X0}.
The proof of the following perturbation result relies on the fundamen-
tal Proposition 5.

converges in the uniform operator topology of L(X0) uniformly on com-
pact subsets of {(t, s) : t ≥s ≥0} and deﬁnes an evolution family on
X0, satisfying
∥U(t, s)∥≤Me(ω+Mc)(t−s)
(2.5)
for t ≥s ≥0 and c := supτ≥0 ∥B(τ)∥L(X0,X).
In addition, (U(t, s))t≥s≥0 satisﬁes the variation of constants formula
U(t, s)x = T0(t−s)x+
 t
s
T−1(t−σ)B(σ)U(σ, s)x dσ,
x ∈X0, t ≥s ≥0.
(2.6)
Moreover, if t −→B(t)x is diﬀerentiable on IR+ for all x ∈X0 then,
for all x ∈D(C(s)), t −→U(t, s)x is diﬀerentiable on [s, ∞), U(t, s)x ∈
D(C(t)) and
d
dtU(t, s)x = (A + B(t))U(t, s)x
for all t ≥s.
In this case we say that the evolution family is generated by the family
(C(t), D(C(t)))t≥0.
In the autonomous case, B(t) ≡B, the operator
C = A + B,
D(C) = {x ∈D(A) : Ax + Bx ∈X0}
(2.7)
generates a C0-semigroup (S(t))t≥0, see [187, Thm. 4.1.5]. From Theo-

Homogeneous Retarded Diﬀerential
Equations
In this section we apply the extrapolation results from the previous
section to solve the homogeneous retarded diﬀerential equations
(HRDE)
 x′(t) = Ax(t) + L(t)xt,
t ≥s,
xs = ϕ,
and study the regularity and the asymptotic behaviour of their solutions.
Here, A is a Hille-Yosida operator on a Banach space E.
Let S :=
(S0(t))t≥0 the C0-semigroup generated by the part of A in E0 := D(A),
and (S−1(t))t≥0 its extrapolated semigroup.
(L(t))t≥0 is a family of
bounded linear operators from Cr := C([−r, 0], E0) to E.
By a (classical) solution of (HRDE), we design a continuously dif-
ferentiable function x : [−r, +∞) −→E0, which satisﬁes the equation
(HRDE), and by a mild solution a continuous function x : [−r, +∞) −→
E0, satisfying
x(t) =

To get the purpose of this section, we associate to the equation (HRDE)
an equivalent Cauchy problem on the product Banach space X := E×Cr

0ϕ := ϕ

Before showing the equivalence of (HRDE) and (CP)0, we study the
well-posedness of the last Cauchy problem (CP)0. To do this, we write
the operator A(t) as the sum of the operator
A :=

As we have remarked at the introduction, X0 := D(A) = {0} × Cr which
means that the operator A is not densely deﬁned. For this reason, we
propose to use the extrapolation theory to study the well-posedness of
the Cauchy problem (CP)0.
To this purpose, we need to show that the operator A is of Hille-
Yosida. This result has been shown in [199] when A generates a C0-
semigroup.
Lemma 7 The operator A is of Hille-Yosida and
R (λ, A)n ( y

for all τ ∈[−r, 0], y ∈E, g ∈Cr and n ≥1.
Proof. From the equation (λ −A)( 0
ϕ1 ) = ( y
g ) on the space X, we
have
ϕ1(τ) = eλτϕ1(0) +
 0
τ
eλ(τ−σ)g(σ) dσ,
τ ∈[−r, 0],
and
Aϕ1(0) −ϕ′
1(0) = y.
We conclude that
ϕ1(τ) = eλτR(λ, A)[y + g(0)] +
 0
τ
eλ(τ−σ)g(σ) dσ,
τ ∈[−r, 0].
It is clear that the function ϕ1 belongs to Cr, and the relation (3.2) is
satisﬁed for n = 1. By induction, we obtain
ϕn(τ) =
n−1

Since A is a Hille-Yosida operator, it follows that

and it generates a C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0, by Proposition 1. It is clear
then that the operator

it is given by
(T0(t)ϕ) (θ) =

To study now the existence of classical solution of (HRDE), we assume:

, ϕ ∈Cr, are continuously dif-
ferentiable. Thus, by the perturbation result, Theorem 6, the family of
the parts of operators (A + B(t)) in X0 generates an evolution family

From the equality (3.12), one can obtain easily the relation (3.11).

proved. The assertion (ii) can also be deduced from the above relations.
In the particular case of autonomous retarded diﬀerential equations,

φ ∈C1([−r, 0], E0) : φ(0) ∈D(A); ϕ′(0) = Aϕ(0) + Lϕ

.
From Section 2, the operator (A + B)/X0 generates a C0-semigroup T :=
(T (t))t≥0. Hence, from the form of (A + B)/X0, one can see that the
operator (AL, D(AL)) generates also a C0-semigroup T := (T(t))t≥0 on
Cr, and
T (t) =

Moreover, T is given by the Dyson-Phillips series

From this and Lemma 7, one can see easily as in the non-autonomous
case that

T0(t −s)eλ·λR(λ, A)LTn−1(s)ϕ ds,

Thus, we obtain the relation (3.14). The assertions (i)-(ii) are particular
cases of Proposition 9.
The Dyson-Phillips series obtained in the above theorem will be now
used to study the regularity properties of the semigroup T solution of the
retarded equation (HRDE). As, the terms Tn of the series, see (3.14),
are convolutions between the extrapolated semigroup (S−1(t))t≥0 and
E-valued functions, to get our aim, we need the following results.
Lemma 11 [17] Let G ∈C(IR+, Ls(Cr)). Then,
(i)
If {t : t > 0} ∋t →S0(t) ∈L(E0) is continuous (or S is
immediately norm continuous) then {t : t > 0} ∋t −→
 t
0 S−1(t −
s)LG(s) ds ∈L(Cr, E0) is continuous.
(ii) If the operator S0(t) is compact for all t > 0 (or S is immediately
compact) then the operator
 t
0
S−1(t −s)LG(s) ds
deﬁned from Cr to E0 is compact for all t ≥0.
Now, we can announce the following regularity results, showed also,
for instance, in [1], [63] and [253].
Theorem 12 (i) If S is immediately norm continuous then {t : t >
r} ∋t →T(t) ∈L(Cr) is also a continuous function.
(ii) If S is immediately compact then T(t) is also compact for all t > r.

Proof. By the deﬁnition of the semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 it is easy to
show that t →T0(t) is norm continuous for t > r if we consider (i), and
that the operator T0(t) is compact for all t > r in the case of (ii).
Assume that S is immediately norm continuous. From the relations
(3.14) and Lemma 11 (i), the function IR+ ∋t →Tn(t) ∈L(Cr) is
continuous for all n ≥1. We have seen in Theorem 10 that
T(t) =
∞

n=0
Tn(t) = T0(t) +
∞

n=1
Tn(t),
t ≥0,
(3.15)
and that this series converge in L(Cr) uniformly in compact intervals of
IR+. Hence, the assertion (i) is obtained.
Treat now the assertion (ii). Let t > 0 and n ≥1. From Lemma 11,
we have that
 t+θ
0
S−1(t + θ −s)LTn−1(s) ds
is a compact operator from Cr to E0 for all t + θ ≥0, and then Tn(t)(θ)
is also a compact operator from Cr to E0 for all θ ∈[−r, 0].
By [63, Theorem II.4.29], we have also that S is immediately norm
continuous. Hence, by Lemma 11 (i), the set of functions {θ →
 t+θ
0
S−1(t+
θ−s)LTn−1(s)ϕ ds
ϕ in some bounded set of Cr} is equicontinuous, and
then the subset {θ →Tn(t)(θ)
ϕ in some bounded set of Cr} of Cr is
equicontinuous.
The compactness of Tn(t) for all t > 0 and n ≥1
follows ﬁnally from Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Consequently, as the series
(3.15) converges in the uniform operator topology of Cr, we obtain the
second assertion.
We end this section by studying the robustness of the asymptotic be-
haviour of the solutions to non-autonomous retarded equation (HRDE)
with respect to the term retard.
More precisely, we show that the
solution of (HRDE) IR+ ∋t −→x(t) has the same asymptotic be-
haviour, e.g., boundedness, asymptotic almost periodicity, as the map
IR+ ∋t −→S0(t)ϕ(0).
First, let us recall the following deﬁnitions:
For a function f ∈BUC(IR+, X0), the space of bounded and uni-
formly continuous functions from IR+ into X0, the set of all translates,
called the hull of f, is H(f) := {f(· + t) : t ∈IR+}.
The function f is said to be asymptotically almost periodic if H(f) is
relatively compact in BUC(IR+, X0), and Eberlein weakly asymptotically
almost periodic if H(f) is weakly relatively compact in BUC(IR+, X0),
see [129] for more details.

534
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
A closed subspace E of BUC(IR+, X0) is said to be translation bi-
invariant if for all t ≥0
f ∈E ⇐⇒f(· + t) ∈E,
and operator invariant if M ◦f ∈E for every f ∈E and M ∈L(X0),
where M ◦f is deﬁned by (M ◦f)(t) = M(f(t)), t ≥0.
The closed subspace E is said to be homogeneous if it is translation
bi-invariant and operator invariant.
For our purpose, we assume that:
(H1) the C0-semigroup (S0(t))t≥0 is of contraction,
(H2) there exist s0 ≥0 and a constant 0 ≤q < 1 such that
 ∞
0
||L(s + t)T0(t)ϕ||dt ≤q||ϕ|| for all ϕ ∈Cr and s ≥s0.
(3.16)
Under the above hypotheses, we have the following results.
Proposition 13 (i) For all ϕ ∈Cr, n ∈N and t ≥s ≥s0
 +∞
s
∥L(σ)Un(σ, s)ϕ∥dσ ≤qn+1∥ϕ∥
(3.17)
and
∥Un(t, s)ϕ∥≤qn∥ϕ∥.
(3.18)
(ii) The series (3.8) converges uniformly on all the set {(t, s) : t ≥s ≥
s0}. Moreover, the evolution family (U(t, s))t≥s≥0 is uniformly bounded
and
||U(t, s)|| ≤
1
1 −q
for all t ≥s ≥s0.
Proof.
Let ϕ ∈Cr and t ≥s ≥s0. For n = 0, the estimate (3.17) is only
our assumption (3.16). Suppose now that the estimate holds for n −1.
From the relation (3.8), by using Fubini’s theorem we have

Hence, from (H1), the inequality (3.16) and the induction hypothesis
 t
s
||L(σ)Un(σ, s)ϕ||dσ ≤q
 t
s
∥L(τ)Un−1(τ, s)ϕ||dτ

and this gives the estimate (3.17).
The inequality (3.18) follows also from (H1), the relation (3.8) and
the ﬁrst estimate (3.17).
The assertion (ii) follows then by this estimate (3.18).
In the above proposition we obtain the boundedness of the evolution
family (U(t, s))t≥s≥0, and thus from (3.13), the boundedness of the mild
solution of (HRDE) is also obtained. To obtain the asymptotic almost
periodicity, and other asymptotic properties of this mild solution we
need the following Lemma.
Lemma 14 Let g ∈L1(IR+, E). If t −→T0(t)ϕ belongs to E for all
ϕ ∈Cr then the function
IR+ ∋t −→T0 ∗g(t) := lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)g(τ)dτ
belongs to E.
Proof. For g ∈L1(IR+, E), since (T0(t))t≥0 is bounded, it is clear that
!!!! lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)g(τ)dτ
!!!! ≤C∥g∥L1,

536
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
which implies that for every g ∈L1(IR+, E), T0∗g ∈BC(IR+, Cr) and the
linear operator g −→T0∗g is bounded from L1(IR+, E) into BC(IR+, Cr),
the space of all bounded continuous functions. By this boundedness, the
linearity and the density, it is suﬃcient to show this result for simple
functions. Let g := 1(a,b) ⊗x, b ≥a ≥0, x ∈E and t ≥0. We have,
T0 ∗g(t + b) = lim
λ→∞
 b
a
T0(t + b −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)x dτ
= T0(t) lim
λ→∞
 b
a
T0(b −τ)eλ·λR(λ, A)x dτ.
Hence, since E is translation bi-invariant and t −→T0(t)ϕ belongs to
E for every ϕ ∈Cr, we conclude that T0 ∗g(·) ∈E, and this achieve the
proof.
We can now state the following main asymptotic behaviour result.
Theorem 15 Assume that (H1) and (H2) hold. If t −→T0(t)ϕ be-
longs to E for all ϕ ∈Cr, and the condition ( 3.16) is satisﬁed then, the
Cr-valued function IR+ ∋t −→xt+s(·, s, ϕ) is also in E for all ϕ ∈Cr
and s ≥0, where x(·, s, ϕ) is the mild solution of (HRDE).
Proof. From Proposition 9 and the relation (3.11), we have
xt+s(·, s, ϕ) = T0(t)ϕ+ lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −σ)eλ·λR(λ, A)L(s + σ)U(s + σ, s)ϕ dσ,
t ≥0.
(3.19)
As t −→T0(t)ϕ belongs to E, it is suﬃcient to that the function f from
IR+ to Cr
f(t) := lim
λ→∞
 t
0
T0(t −σ)eλ·λR(λ, A)L(s + σ)U(s + σ, s)ϕ dσ,
t ≥0
belongs to E as well. Furthermore, by Lemma 14, it is suﬃcient to show
that the function g(·) := L(·+ s)U(·+ s, s)ϕ belongs to L1(IR+, E), and
this follows from (3.8) and the estimate (3.17) for all s ≥s0. Hence,
the function IR+ ∋t −→xt+s(·, s, ϕ) = U(t + s, s)ϕ belongs to E for all
s ≥s0 and ϕ ∈Cr.
For all s ≥0 and t ≥0, one can write
U(t + s0 + s, s)ϕ = U(t + s + s0, s + s0)U(s + s0, s)ϕ.
As s + s0 ≥s0, then as shown above t −→U(t + s0 + s, s + s0)ϕ belongs
to E and by the translation bi-invariance of E, t −→xt+s(·, s, ϕ) =
U(t + s, s)ϕ belongs to E. This achieves the proof.

The C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 is given in terms of the C0-semigroup
(S0(t))t≥0, then we can hope that they have the same asymptotic be-
haviour. In the following lemma, we present some particular commune
asymptotic behaviours to these two semigroups.
Lemma 16 Let ϕ ∈Cr. Assume that the map IR+ ∋t −→S0(t)ϕ(0) is
(1) vanishing at inﬁnity, or
(2) asymptotically almost periodic, or
(3) uniformly ergodic, i.e., the limit lim
α→0+ α
 ∞
0
e−αsS0(·+s)ϕ(0) ds ex-
ists and deﬁnes an element of BUC(IR+, E0), or
(4) totally uniformly ergodic, i.e., the Ces´aro limit
lim
t→+∞
1
t
 t
0
eiθsS0(·+
s)ϕ(0) ds exists in BUC(IR+, E0) for all θ ∈IR.
Then, the function IR+ ∋t −→T0(t)ϕ has the same property in
BUC(IR+, Cr).
Proof.
As (S0(t))t≥0 is a contraction semigroup, we have for all t > r and
θ ∈[−r, 0]
∥(T0(t)ϕ)(θ)∥= ∥S0(t + θ)ϕ(0)∥= ∥S0(r + θ)S0(t −r)ϕ(0)∥
≤∥S0(t −r)ϕ(0)∥.
If one has (1), then ∥T0(t)ϕ∥−→0, when t →∞.
Assume now that we have (2). By the deﬁnition of asymptotic almost
periodicity, see [7], for every ε > 0 there is l(ε) > 0 and K ≥0 such that
each interval of length l(ε) contains a τ for which this inequality
||S0(t + τ)ϕ(0) −S0(t)ϕ(0)|| ≤ε
holds for all t, t + τ ≥K. Let now t > K + r. Then, one has
∥(T0(t + τ)ϕ)(θ) −(T0(t)ϕ)(θ)∥= ∥S0(t + θ + τ)ϕ(0) −S0(t + θ)ϕ(0)∥
≤∥S0(t −r + τ)ϕ(0) −S0(t −r)ϕ(0)∥
< ε
for all θ ∈[−r, 0],
and this means that T0(·)ϕ is asymptotically almost periodic.
The assertions (3) and (4) can be showed by the same technique.
As the classes of functions (1)-(4) are particular homogeneous closed
subspaces of BUC(IR+, Cr), see [22], by Theorem 15 and Lemma 16, we
have the following corollary.
Corollary 17 Assume that (H1) and (H2) hold and that for all ϕ ∈Cr
the function

538
DELAY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
IR+ ∋t −→S0(t)ϕ(0) belongs to one of the classes (1)-(4) of Lemma
16. Then, for all ϕ ∈Cr, the mild solution x(·, 0, ϕ) of (HRDE) belongs
to the same class.

is satisﬁed for a large s0.
For this example, the operator A is deﬁned on E by
Af = −∂
∂xf −αf,
D(A) = {g ∈W 1,1(0, ∞) : g(0) = 0},
and it generates the exponentially stable semigroup

a −t ≥0,

otherwise.
By the above corollary, the solutions of the partial retarded diﬀerential
equation (3.20) are asymptotically stable.
