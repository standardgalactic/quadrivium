The return statement
●
We use the return keyword to send back the result of the function instead of printing it 
out. Return allows us to assign the output of the function to a new variable.
 
 
def func2(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    return sum
s = func2(2, 3)
print(f'Sum:{s}')
●
A function that doesn't return explicitly, returns implicitly None.
●
The return statement exists a function.
●
A function can return more than one value and in that case it returns a tuple.
