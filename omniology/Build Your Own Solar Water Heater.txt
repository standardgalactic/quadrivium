Foreword 
The whole solar energy field is growing by as-
tonishing — and sometimes confusing — leaps 
and bounds. But we know this much for sure: 
that using the sun to heat domestic hot water is 
the most practical and least expensive applica-
tion of solar energy at this time. Heating water 
with the sun is incredibly simple; and although 
some experts try to make it seem otherwise, most 
of the techniques can be understood by any 7th 
grader. 
Besides, solar water heating isn't new. It's been 
going on for centuries. There were some pretty 
elaborate and sophisticated solar heaters around 
by the end of the 19th century, and in 1951 there 
were as many as 50,000 solar water heaters in 
Miami, Florida alone. People in Japan, Israel and 
Australia have been relying on them for years. So 
there's a good body of knowledge and experi-
ence to draw from. 
Build Your Own Solar Water Heater is strictly 
about solar water heating. Bruce Anderson, a re-
spected solar expert at Total Environmental Ac-
tion in New Hampshire says, "1 strongly believe 
people have to know as much as possible about 
a solar system before putting any money into it." 
He's right, and 1 hope this book helps fill that bill. 
What you should know from the start is that, 
yes, eventually solar power will be cheaper than 
fossil fuel, electricity, and probably even nuclear 
energy. After all, the most attractive thing about 
solar energy is that it's free. But the equipment 
needed to collect and store it is fairly expensive. 
And in spite of what a lot of people are saying, 
solar systems of all kinds are not likely to get 
cheaper. Granted, some manufacturing costs 
may go down, but the inflationary spiral will surely 
neutralize any possible savings. 
The sooner you invest in a solar energy sys-
tem, the earlier you'll be able to pay for it in fuel-
expense savings. And once you've paid it off, ex-
cept for incidental maintenance costs, it's all 
gravy from then on. 
The second thing you should know before you 
begin is that everything in this book works. It's 
not just theory. We've built it, or we've done it, or 
we've tested it. And we've made plenty of mis-
takes — ones you can avoid. We've also had a lot 
of success and have a pretty good idea of how 
much it all should cost you. 
Besides doing our own experimenting, we've 
explored what others have to say. We've been 
watching big industry as it begins to move into 
the solar field, and we've been keeping an eye on 
some of the "counter-culture" folks who have 
been there for some time, and whose funky in-
ventive work is often more promising than what's 
coming out of the big companies. 
All of the exploration boils down to this: If 
you're willing to do a lot of the installation work 
yourself, heating most of your hot water by the 
sun can be very economical. Even if you buy 
prefabricated components and hire a contractor 
to put them in, it may take somewhat longer to 
get your money back, but it will still be worthwhile 
in the long run. 
We'll offer easy-to-understand suggestions 
about very simple hot water systems at first, and 
gradually go on to describe more complex ones. 
But all of the designs will have three fundamental 
components: (1) the solar collector itself, which 
transforms the sun's rays into usable heat, (2) the 
transfer and storage system, which moves the 
heat from the collector to a place where it can be 
kept and protected for later use, and (3) a control 
system, either automatic or manual, which regu-
lates the whole heater — turning it on or off, 
speeding it up or slowing it down as the intensity 
of the sun and household demands dictate. 
You can pick and choose as you please, confi-
dent that if you understand the easy principles 
involved, and can adapt them to your home's 
structure, you're sure to end up with a solar water 
heater that not only works well and saves you 
vii 

money, but makes you feel as though you're 
somehow beating the system. That's the most 
fun of all. 
"There's no such thing as a free lunch," or so 
they say, but there can be free showers and 
baths. Stay in as long as you like, and don't worry 
about the gas, oil, or electric bill. Enjoy the fruits 
of a sunny day — even after dark. Solar hot water 
can cost little or nothing. 
And when you step into the shower, remember 
the remark that appears in the bottom comer of 
Steve Baer's Zomeworks blueprint for a simple 
solar hot water heater. He says, "Solar hot water 
gets you cleaner, makes you happier, rests your 
bones, cures impotence. If you don't believe it, 
ask someone who uses it." 
Maybe we won't go that far, but we can say this 
much: once your solar water heater is working, 
it's likely to become a curiosity, and you may 
become a local celebrity. People may want to visit 
and have a look. Be prepared for lots of questions 
and lots of small talk if you let them come. 
Whether or not you decide to invite them into the 
shower is entirely up to you.

CHAPTER 1 
Dollars and Sense 
Unless you're very rich — or very trusting — 
you'll want to sit down with a pencil and paper 
and do some "ciphering" before you decide if 
and how you're going to put a solar hot water 
system in your home. 
Various types of solar water heaters are at work 
right now, in all parts of the United States, saving 
people money. That's a pretty safe statement. But 
don't accept it on faith. If you can make some 
simple calculations you can get a fairly accurate 
picture of how much free hot water you can ex-
pect and how long it will take to get back your 
initial investment. Let's get some of the numbers 
out of the way before getting down to other de-
tails. 
Try to keep in mind that there are all kinds of 
variables in these figures. To keep ourselves 
honest, let's use very conservative efficiency fig-
ures and very high cost estimates for a theoreti-
cal hot water system that's fairly complex (see 
Figure 1). In other words, because we'll be using 
figures that are extreme, you may be able to do 
better than what you see here, just by building a 
simpler system, by finding cheaper parts, or by 
making your heater more efficient. 
How Much Hot Water Do 
We Use? 
Americans use — and waste — appalling 
amounts of hot water. People in other parts of the 
world just can't believe us. Motel owners in 
Europe complain bitterly about how tourists from 
the United States increase their fuel bills and 
overload their septic systems. We're spoiled. We 
squander water just the way we've squandered 
many of our other resources. 
John Murphy, in the Homeowner's Energy 
Guide, says that we use up hot water in approxi-
mately this way: Every time we take a shower we 
use about 10 gallons of hot water. Whenever we 
take a bath we use at least that much — often 
more. An average clothes washer uses 22 gallons 
of hot water per regular washing cycle, and an 
automatic dishwasher uses about 15 gallons — 
which, by the way, can be more hot water than it 
takes to wash dishes in the sink by hand. 
Each time we shave or wash our hands we use 
about 1/2 gallon of hot water, on the average. 
But what's really shocking is how much we waste 
just testing the temperature of our shower water 
— 1/2 to 2 gallons a test! We're literally pouring 
energy down the drain. (See Panel 1.) 
Figure 1. This simplified schematic diagram shows 
the three major components in a solar-operated hot 
water system: (1) the collectors themselves, (2) the 
pump, plumbing, storage tank and heat-exchanger 
coil, and (3) the differential thermostat that controls 
the whole system. 

All of this averages out to 2,500 gallons of hot 
water a month for a family of 5, or 30,000 gallons 
a year. That may be twice as much as we actually 
need, but it's what we're used to. This can he 
reduced of course, in any number of ways: by 
lowering the thermostat on the hot water heater, 
insulating hot water tanks and pipes, using cold 
water detergents and washing clothes in cold 
water, and — best of all — taking a shower with a 
friend. 
How Much Does 
Hot Water Cost Now? 
When you get a conventional hot water heater 
from the factory, the thermostat is normally pre-
set at 165 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a lot hotter 
than the water needs to be. Human skin can 
comfortably stand water temperatures in the 105 
to 115 degree range, and this is about the temp-
erature of the water that comes out of your 
shower head. 
To get water to this temperature we usually mix 
hot and cold water together, which should be 
enough to convince us that there's really no need 
for water that's as high as 165 degrees. We'd do 
just fine to turn the heater down to as low as 130°. 
(Below this setting we would have to run less cold 
water with hot, but we would run out of hot water 
much sooner.) 
Yet all indications are that most people don't 
— partly because they don't know they should, 
and partly because thermostats, particularly ones 
on older electric water heaters, are hard to find, 
much less get at. Because this is the case, let's 
use 165 degrees as a point of departure so we 
can do some arithmetic. 
PANEL 1 
WAYS FAMILIES CAN 
CONTROL HOT WATER OSAGE 
1. Showers instead of baths. Baths nor-
mally use more and hotter water. Showers 
should be short. Set a timer for a shower 
taker. If you install a water-saving shower 
head, you'll be using up to 40% less hot 
water. 
2. Shaving. Partially fill the basin with hot 
water rather than letting the faucet run. 
3. Dishwashing by hand. It may not be 
necessary to wash dishes three times a 
day. Washing once will save hot water, 
human energy, and time. Rinse dishes in a 
pan rather than under running water. 
4. Dishwasher, Wash full loads. Don't 
handwash before putting dishes in the 
dishwasher. 
5. Food disposal. Always use cold water. 
6. Leaky faucets. Fix them right away. One 
dripping hot water faucet can cost up to 
$ 15 extra per year if not repaired. 
7. Laundry, Wash full loads. Wash in hot 
water, but rinse in cold water. 
8. Stagger use of hot water. Eliminate heavy 
demand on your supply of hot water in a 
short period of time. 
9. Water heater. Shutting off the "quick-
recoveiy" element in an electric hot water 
heater will not save energy. Instead, turn 
the thermostat down. If away from home 
for extended periods of time, turn it down 
still further. Precautions should be taken 
to prevent pipes from freezing in winter. 
10. Insulation, Insulate the hot water heater 
with an extra 6" of fiberglass. This much 
insulation should pay for itself in just 2 to 
3 months.

The minute we start thinking about heat, we 
have to understand what a BTU is. "BTU" stands 
for British Thermal Unit, and a BTU is just a sim-
ple measuring unit for heat. One BTU is the 
amount of heat needed to raise the temperature 
of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. 
You may already know that. The problem comes 
when we have to convert pounds of water to gal-
lons — because we think of water in terms of gal-
lons, not pounds. A gallon of water weighs 8.33 
pounds, which means that it takes 8.33 BTU's to 
heat a gallon of water one degree. 
Now, the normal temperature of ground water 
in most parts of the world is around 55 degrees 
Fahrenheit, give or take a couple of degrees. 
Water from a well, spring, or even a municipal 
water main will probably be this cold when it 
comes into your house. 
if we want to raise the temperature of this water 
to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, we'll have to increase 
its temperature by 110 degrees (165 minus 55). 
if we then multiply 110 degrees temperature dif-
ference by 8.33 pounds — the weight of one 
gallon of water — we come up with a figure of 
916.30. 
110x8.33 = 916.30 BTU's 
This means that it takes over 900 BTU's to heat a 
single gallon of water to the temperature that the 
preset thermostat on the hot water heater is ask-
ing for. 
Over the course of a year the 30,000 gallons of 
hot water that our imaginary family of 5 uses 
would require 27,489,000 BTU's to heat (916.30 
X 30,000). Of course some of this heat is lost. It 
leaks out of the hot water tank and sneaks out of 
the plumbing every chance it gets on its way to 
the shower or dishwasher. So the 27.5 million 
BTU figure can't be accurate. It's pretty hard to 
say how much heat is actually lost, but estimating 
conservatively, we can safely guess that 2.5 mil-
lion BTU's are lost in a year's time. So the real 
heat requirement looks more like 30 million 
Bug's a year (Panel 2). 
Heating costs are most easily measured in 
terms of dollars per million BTU's. A million 
Bug's of electricity costs about $14.64 on the av-
erage in 1977. (That's figuring electricity at 50 a

If we can agree that 165 degrees is an unrea-
sonably high setting for a hot water heater, let's 
take a look at line 4 in the table shown here. This 
is the 140 degree setting — which may make 
more sense. 
These figures represent somewhere between 
15 and 25% of the family's total energy dollar. 
Taking it one giant step further, about 4% of the 
nation's energy consumption goes into heating 
domestic hot water (see Panel 3). 
How Much Energy Do You 
Need to Heat Your Water? 
Here's how to compute how much of an energy 
load you put on your hot water system now: 
Q = G X K X A T 
This standard formula looks pretty complicated, 
but it's simple once you understand what all the 
symbols stand for. 
Your family's BTU requirements for a day (Q) 
equals the number of gallons of hot water used in

a day (G) multiplied by the weight of water (8.33 
pounds per gallon — or K) times the difference 
between your incoming water supply and the 
chosen water temperature at the faucet (AT). 
The average American individual uses about 
20 gallons of hot water each day. The amount of 
water used in a household in one day can be eas-
ily Figured by multiplying the number of people in 
the family by 20 gallons. Let's stick with a family 
of 5, since that's where we started. So a family of 
5 uses 100 gallons of hot water every day.

FOR HEATING DOMESTIC HOT 
WATER AT 140 DEGREES F. 
Above 140° F. cold water is normally mixed with hot — 
unless you're doing laundry. So the cost figures in lines 1,

We have already figured out what AT is all 
about, if we subtract the temperature of the water 
coming into the heater (55 degrees) from the 
temperature of the heated water (140 degrees) 
we get the temperature differential — or AT — 
which is 85 degrees. So our equation looks like 
this: 
Q = 100 X 8.33 X 85 = 70,805 BTU's per day 
Again, what all this means is that for every 100 
gallons of hot water that you and yours use each 
day, your present system has to generate almost 
71,000 Bug's of heat. A system for a family of 4 
TABLE 1 
DAILY SUNSHINE ON A SOUTH-FACING ROOF 
will have to generate 56,664 BTU's per day 
(Panel 4). What you now need to figure out is 
what percentage of your total BTU requirements 
you will be able to generate with solar power 
(Tables 1 and 2). 
Table 1. This table gives you an idea of how many 
Bug's of solar energy fall on a square foot of surface 
in one hour. Note how the numbers vary from month 
to month and from one latitude to the next. On a hori-
zontal surface (0 degrees) the smallest amount of 
solar energy falls in December, and the greatest 
amount in June. But as the steepness of the roof in-
creases toward vertical (90 degrees) the figures 
change. Because solar collectors are traditionally 
mounted on rooftops, the angle of a south-facing roof 
is an important consideration.

TABLE 2 
MEAN PERCENTAGE OF POSSIBLE 
SUNSHINE FOR SELECTED LOCATIONS 
Table 2. The sun only shines a certain percentage of 
the time — mostly because of cloud cover. The figures 
in Table 2 give you a month-by-month reading of the 
percentage of possible sunshine in different cities 
across the U.S. In most cases the month with the least 
sunshine is January. This is when it becomes most 
difficult to generate enough heat from the sun to heat 
a large percentage of your domestic hot water. 

Here you need to stop and be very honest with 
yourself. Unless you live near the equator — 
where the sun is very strong all year long — it's 
unrealistic to even think about trying to make 
your solar water system 100% free of utility bills. 
There will be certain times during the year when 
you just can not collect or store that many BTU's 
from the sun, and will have to either rely on a 
conventional back-up system or go without hot 
water altogether. 
But it is realistic to think about being between 
50 and 90% independent of utility costs. In fact, 
75% efficiency might be a reasonable target to 
shoot for. Don't forget, once your system has 
finished paying for itself, you would be getting 
75% of your hot water for nothing. It also means 
that in the summer, and part of the spring and 
fall, you are getting 100% of your heated water for 
free, because 75% represents the yearly average. 
Statistics show, by the way, that we don't use any 
less hot water in the summer than we do during 
the colder months, so that's something else to 
keep in mind. 
Without getting into a lot of heavy mathemat-
ics at this time, we can say this much: It should be 
easy to get 50% efficiency with any reasonably 
designed solar system. But after that you get di-
minishing returns. It gets harder and harder to 
achieve higher efficiencies — especially during 
December, January and February here in the

northern hemisphere. And it will be almost im-
possible to get 100% during these months, even 
with a whole roof full of solar collectors. But with 
some careful planning and a little know-how, 75% 
annual efficiency is well within the realm of pos-
sibility in most parts of the country (Figure 2). 
How Many Collectors 
Will You Need? 
This is a very complicated question. There are as 
many oversimplified rules of thumb for answer-
ing it, as there are unbelievably complex formulas 
that try to include all of the different factors in-
volved. As you get further into the book, you will 
begin to see how intricate the variables become. 
For now, look at Table 3. It's an attempt to give 
you a rough idea of how many collectors you will 
need where you are. It lists 80 cities in the United 
Estates and Canada, but chances are good that 
your home town does not appear there. You'll 
have to find the city closest to you and use it as 
your reference. 
The table assumes that you have a roof on 
your house that faces south or close to south — 
within 20 degrees. If your roof faces more than 
20 degrees away from south you may need to 
add up to 50% more collector area. If the ridge of 
your home runs north and south so roofs face 
east and west, you may need as much as twice 
the collector area recommended in the table. 
(There's no law that says solar collectors have to 
be mounted on a roof. There may be some place 
else that's more convenient.) 
Notice as you study Table 3 that these are es-
timated summer and wintertime requirements 
for just one person. Look at Columbus, Ohio for 
example. A family of 4 there would need 4 times 
0.7 or 2.8 collectors (67.2 square feet) in the 
summer, and 4 times 3.1 or 12.4 collectors 
(297.6 square feet) in the winter to satisfy 90 to 
100% of their hot water load. You can average the 
two to get a reasonable estimate for year-round 
operation. 
You should round off the number of collectors 
once you have multiplied the factor in the table

Table 3. The numbers in Table 3 are the result of some 
fairly complex calculations. The table tells you how 
many solar collector panels would be needed per per-
son in different parts of the country in both summer 
and winter. The figures assume that a single solar col-
lector has 24 square feet of surface area — although 
not all solar collectors are this size. This recom-
mended number of collectors should satisfy 90 to 
100% of one person's hot water needs.

by the number of people in the family. If you av-
erage the summertime needs and the winter 
needs and end up with a figure of 3.3 collectors, 
plan on 3. If you calculate that you need 4.7 col-
lector panels, go to 5, and so on. 
Think about fewer collectors at first, rather than 
more. You can always add collectors later on if 
you feel you can increase your efficiency signif-
icantly. 
Your costs could be astronomical if you try to 
have enough collectors to supply 90 to 100% of 
your wintertime domestic hot water needs. But 
you can be pretty well assured that the number of 
collectors needed to give you 90 to 100% effi-
ciency in the summer will supply about 45 to 50% 
of your year-round needs, once everything is av-
eraged out. 
In other words, you're going to have to work 
out a compromise. You'll have to balance what 
your system can do in December — probably too 
little — against what it can do in June — probably 
more than enough. Whether you decide to be 
satisfied with an average efficiency of 45% or to 
try for 90% will depend mostly on how much 
money you would like to invest. Either way you'll 
be saving money in the long run. 
How Much Does a Solar 
Water System Cost? 
Let's discuss collectors first, since they might 
represent the largest expense. How much you will 
have to spend depends on a number of things: 
where you live, how many people there are in the 
family, how efficient you want your system to be, 
and whether you plan to buy pre-fabricated col-
lectors or build them yourself. (Chapter 5 gives 
you details on how to build your own collectors.) 
A typical "flat plate" collector — the kind used 
for solar water heating — is about 3 feet wide and 
8 feet long, though this can vary from manufac-
turer to manufacturer. (You might also decide — 
if you're making your own — that these dimen-
sions don't fit your situation.) 
In any case, the typical surface area of a collec-
tor is 24 square feet. (Not all collectors have 24 
square feet, remember.) If your calculations tell 
you that you're going to need two collectors, it's 
easy enough to figure out that you'll have 48 
square feet of collector surface. 
The cost of a ready-made solar collector is $ 10 
to $12 a square foot. Averaging this to $11 a 
square foot your cost for 2 collectors would be 
$528 (11 X 48). If you build your own collectors, 
on the other hand, you should be able to do it for 
$4 to $4.50 a square foot — even if you buy the 
most critical and hard-to-make component, the 
collector plate itself. (More on the collector plate 
in Chapter 3.) At $4.50 a square foot, the cost of 
2 collectors would be only $216. So it is worth-
while — and not that difficult — to build your 
own. 
What about other costs? There are all kinds of 
variables here too, but we can make a few gen-
eral assumptions. Let's say you're going to build 
the most sophisticated system recommended in 
this book, but let's also say that you're going to 
buy parts — other than the collectors — from a 
plumbing supply house instead of buying your 
whole system in a pre-fabricated "package" from 
a company that specializes in solar equipment. 
First, you'll need a storage tank — probably 
120 gallons — with a heat exchanger in it. The 
plumbing supplier or distributor should charge 
you about $290 for this. Next you'll need a circu-
lation pump — another $65; next, some ther-
mostatic controls. This sounds expensive, but it's 
not bad — about $40. You'll also need some 
plumbing — tubing, fittings, assorted valves and 
perhaps an expansion tank — along with some 
special anti-freeze. These shouldn't run more 
than $100. 
All told, these items should cost under $500 — 
$495 to be exact. (Remember now, these prices 
are for 1978.) In other words, if you do most of 
the work yourself, and buy directly, eliminating 
the middle-men who would be involved if you 
bought a "prefab" system, you should be able to 
put together an excellent solar water heater for as 
little as $750, allowing a few extra dollars for 
things like roofing cement, caulking compound, 
nails, screws, flashing and so forth ($495 plus 
$216 = $711). 
Will you wind up with an inferior system if you 
build it yourself? You shouldn't. The components 
will be the same or better than those in a pre-

fabricated package; you are just buying them at a 
cheaper rate. Will a pre-fabricated package last 
longer? Mot if you design your own carefully, use 
the best materials you can get for the money, and 
treat the system well. In fact, if you build it your-
self, you should know your system intimately, and 
should be able to do most of the maintenance 
work yourself. 
If you don't enjoy shopping around, and want 
to avoid the hassle of doing the work yourself, 
tack about 45% on to the plumbing costs listed 
above. This means that your system will cost 
somewhere between $1,200 and $2,000. Beyond 
that, you should add another $500 to $700 for 
installation. In short, your pre-fabricated system is 
going to cost $2,500 or more. To put it another 
way, having a contractor do the footwork and 
building for you will cost you about 3 times as 
much as doing it yourself. 
How Long Does it Take 
to Pay Off a Solar Water 
Heater? 
We have already figured out that it can cost a 
family of 5 about $348.43 a year to heat water to 
140 degrees Fahrenheit with electricity. If this 
same family could build a solar water heating 
system for $750 and that system were 75% effi-
cient, they would be saving $261.32 a year in 
electrical utility costs ($348.43 x .75 = $261.32). 
Dividing this figure into $750, we can compute 
that it will take 2.8 years to pay for the system 
(with inflation it may take even less time). 
If the family sp)ent $2,500 to have the system 
installed by someone else, it would take 9.5 years 
to pay it off. Let's keep in mind though, that elec-
tricity is the most expensive way to heat water. 
Fuel oil and natural gas are somewhat cheaper. 
(It would take 8.2 years to pay off a homemade 
system that was previously run entirely with oil, 
and 11.2 years to pay off the same system if it 
were fired by natural gas.) 
To summarize all this in less mathematical 
terms, an average family, with a system of aver-
age efficiency, barring any major breakdowns 
Million British Thermal Units 
Average Consumption Per Family. 
(graph 1. This graph, calculated by Paul Shippee of 
Colorado Sunworks, P.O. Box 455, Boulder, projects 
the costs of heating water with electricity, propane, 
and natural gas over the next several years. It also 
gives you an indication of how long it should take to 
pay for a solar water heater. Shippee's figures, al-
though they vary slightly, are very close to our own. 
and additional expenses, should be able to pay 
for its solar hot water heating system in 5 to 10 
years — which is what you really wanted to know 
in the beginning. 
Are There Other 
Considerations? 
Yes. When you come right down to it, there are 
two big reasons for putting in a solar water heat-
ing system: (1) It will save you money, and (2) the 
fuel you save will benefit society as a whole. Unfortunately our socie
doesn't seem to recognize this second benefit. 
The whole solar energy field screams for more 
special loans and grants for down-to-earth re-
search and development, and for tax incentives 
which would encourage consumers like you and 
rne to put solar systems in our homes. But these 
are very slow in coming. 
Incredible as it may seem, there are many 
places in the United States where installing a 
solar system actually raises a family's real estate 
10 

taxes. In some cases, this increased -tax offsets 
whatever they might be able to save in fuel costs. 
What this amounts to is that government is 
penalizing people for taking the bull by the horns 
and doing what they can to conserve the nation's 
energy. Wherever this happens, there's obviously 
something wrong with the system. Consult your 
local lister or tax assessor to find out where you 
will stand if you decide to change over to solar 
water heating. 
According to Arthur D. Little Associates, solar 
energy research specialists, manufacturing solar 
heating equipment is going to be big business by 
1985. That's terrific, but unfortunately right now 
there is still a need for more performance and 
maintenance standards in the industry. Some 
products simply have not been tested enough, 
and the manufacturers make overly optimistic 
claims about them. 
This is only part of the reason why fairly stan-
dard, tried-and-true plumbing and off-the-shelf 
collector components which you can understand 
and install yourself are the best investment. 
Semi-honest, fast-buck contractors are descend-
ing on the solar market like vultures. There have 
already been several lawsuits brought against 
such operators in Connecticut and elsewhere. 
Others, whose intentions are fine, still have a lot 
to learn about the field, and are likely to make 
mistakes as they cut corners and try to increase 
their profits. 
There have been horror stories in The Hew 
York Times about how solar hot water systems 
break down because of air locks in the water 
pipes, 
improper fittings, putting circulation 
pumps in backwards, faulty wiring, setting timers 
so that units worked only at night when there was 
no sun, and about leaks in pipes that froze be-
cause of poor insulation. Most of these could 
have been avoided had the installers had just a 
little more background and experience. 
A solar water system should have a minimum 
life expectancy of 20 years or more. If it's put 
together carefully with the highest quality materi-
als, if precautions are taken against corrosion 
and freezing, and if it's looked after as regularly as 
you would your car, there's no reason it shouldn't 
last a lifetime. After all, it has few moving parts, 
and anything that might wear out can be readily 
replaced. 
How can you afford the expense of converting 
to solar hot water? Home improvement loans for 
solar systems have been difficult to come by, not 
only because the field seems new and people are 
skeptical, but because there have been no ac-
cepted standards set up by agencies like the 
Federal Housing Authority and the Veteran's 
Administration. But as time goes on, and the 
energy pinch gets tighter, bankers should be-
come more and more sympathetic to loan re-
quests for solar installations. 
There are some proposals for federal tax cred-
its in the works now. If passed by Congress, these 
would assume up to 40% of the cost of a new 
solar system. But this legislation is still in the 
planning stages. Check later to see what results. 
In some states, as of June 1977, you could apply 
for a $400 federal grant toward installing a solar 
water heating system. Ten thousand grants will 
be awarded in all. The ten states that offer this 
program are: 
Connecticut 
Florida 
Maryland 
Massachusetts 
New Hampshire 
New Jersey 
Pennsylvania 
Rhode Island 
Vermont 
and parts of New York 
Check with your state energy office for more de-
tails. 
More federal and state money should be avail-
able soon as our demand for solar energy in-
creases. To stay abreast of what is available for

CHAPTER 2 
Some Words 
About the Sun 
Ancient and "primitive" peoples once wor-
shipped the sun as the ultimate giver-of-life. 
Some philosophers and serious futurists around 
today would say that we're coming back to that. 
Somewhere along the way we just got misled. 
For some reason that no one will ever explain 
fully, our universe is dotted with immense balls of 
energy which we have chosen to call "stars." If we 
consider the universe to be infinite, then it must 
follow that there is an infinite amount of energy 
out there. Our particular star — about which we 
circle every 365.25 days — is expected to keep 
burning for at least another 4 billion years. Al-
though our sun may be finite as an energy 
source, its end is nowhere in our sight. 
The sun is already 8 to 10 billion years old, as 
near as we can guess, and it has been staring us 
in the face ever since the beginning of Man's life. 
(It will probably still be there long after we've gone 
and something else has taken over this planet we 
think we own.) 
It's ironic that since the start the sun has been 
saying, "Here I am!" But our minds got distracted 
or somehow thrown out of whack because we've 
kept saying, "Don't bother me. Sun, I'm looking 
for energy." 
Once in a while someone would pause briefly 
as if to think, "Sun, you're a ball of energy today," 
and even go so far as to dream up ways to har-
ness some of the sun's radiation. Others of us 
have looked on with amused interest, but finally 
said, "That's cool, man, but coal (wood, oil, gas, 
nuclear) is cheaper and easier to get." 
Figure 3. The sun gives off rays of different wave 
lengths. Infrared rays, the ones that give us heat, have 
longer wave lengths. We are pelted less often with 
solar energy units — called "photons" — when the 
waves of solar energy are longer. Ultraviolet rays have 
shorter wave lengths, which means that more photons 
strike the earth at a more rapid rate. 
12 

The sun's energy is all around us ... 
everywhere. We just can't always see it. The sun 
moves through space — bringing us along on a 
gravitational leash — giving off power in all direc-
tions. We receive about 1/200 millionth of its 
total output at any given time. The energy origi-
nates in a process that we understand as "ther-
monuclear fusion," which is like the reaction that 
takes place in a hydrogen bomb. Solar scientists 
estimate that the temperature near the sun's core 
is 45 million degrees Fahrenheit, although it's 
several million degrees cooler than that on the 
solar "surface." 
Energy is "beamed" to us over a distance of 
roughly 93 million miles. The trip, at 186,000 
miles per second, takes just over 8 minutes. Each 
wavy beam of sunlight consists of tiny solar 
energy units called "photons," and these photons 
are being fired at us as though out of a super-
high-speed machine gun. When they hit us more 
frequently — because they come at us in shorter 
wave lengths — their energy is greater than when 
they strike us less often — having arrived in 
longer wave lengths. That's just another way of 
saying that shorter wave lengths mean more 
photon "bullets" and thus more power (Fig-
ure 3). 
Plants catch photons, but they're only as effi-
cient about it as they need to be — using about 1 
percent of what reaches them. Through the won-
der of photosynthesis they change these photons 
into chemical energy and then store it (Figure 4). 
We eat plants — or other animals that eat plant 
life — and also burn certain wood plants to get at 
some of the energy they have saved up. Yet the 
vast majority of plants die a natural death (with-
out being eaten), then decay and are com-
pressed by the weight of the generations that fol-
low. After millions of years they become fossil 
fuels — different forms of stored-up chemical 
energy from vegetation (Figure 5). 
The sun not only sets off the processes that 
create food and fuel, it also directly influences 
other "kinetic" energy sources, such as the 
winds, the tides, rain and thermal forces that 
we've only just begun to wonder how to use. 
The sun is at the heart of it all, but in the twen-
tieth century our civilization has become so 
complex and we've become so disoriented that 
we lose sight of this fact. It's as though we are 
Makes and

Figure 4. Photosynthesis is the chemical miracle that 
goes on all around us every day. Green plants, which 
contain chlorophyll, convert carbon dioxide and water 
into starches and sugars with the help of sunlight. 
Oxygen is a by-product. In a sense, the plant becomes 
a storage area for solar energy, and there are times 
when this energy is stored for millions of years. It gets 
released only when we burn fossil fuels. 
living off a dwindling savings account — chewing 
our nails at how fast it's going — while we ignore 
the steady income of energy that pours down on 
us every day. It's as though in searching out the 
remaining supplies of fossil fuels (because that's 
all we think we know how to do) we're wandering 
in the woods looking for this big stash of change 
that somebody has missed, while there are tons 
of pennies raining all around us. 
It's time to turn back to the sun. 
How Much Energy 
Do We Get From The Sun? 
The diameter of the sun is much larger than that 
of the earth — by about 110 times, in fact. One 
sun "g" would be equivalent to 28 earth "g's," 
which means we would weigh 28 times as much 
as we do now if we could somehow exist on the 
sun. Huge as it is, the sun is converting mass into 
energy at a rate of some 4.7 million tons per 
second and it doesn't seem to be getting much 
smaller (Figure 6). 
13 

Figure 5. All of the ecosystems on earth are depen-
dent on the sun. In comparison to our supplies of fos-
sil fuels, it is by far our largest natural resource. Solar 
energy is stored in fossil fuels, but that's not a very 
efficient means of storage because only a miniscule 
percentage of plant or animal life actually becomes 
coal, oil, or natural gas. 
Figure 6. The earth receives only about 1/200 mil-
lionth of the total energy of the sun. Even then, a large 
portion of solar radiation is reflected back into space 
by our atmosphere. But what does get through to us is 
more than enough to supply all of our energy needs. 
Our "furnace in the sky" shoots power into our 
atmosphere at a fairly consistent rate. This regu-
lar and dependable energy supply is called the 
solar constant, and it can be measured. Just one 
square foot of the outside of the earth's protective 
air layer gets a whopping average of 430 BTU's 
per hour (Figure 7). 
Energy expert Wilson Clark estimates that if all 
of the solar constant got through the atmo-
sphere, and if we could collect it at 100% effi-
ciency, an area the size of the United States 
would absorb enough energy in just 32 minutes 
to supply the world's complete energy needs for 
a year. 
That the atmosphere absorbs a large percen-
tage of solar radiation is good news as well as 
-bad. The shortest waves of solar radiation, ul-
traviolet rays, have the greatest energy content. 
Most of these are screened out by our all-
important ozone layer, making life on earth pos-
sible. If these rays were to reach us directly and in 
14 

Figure 7. The solar constant is the amount of solar 
energy that hits the outside of the earth's atmosphere. 
One square foot of surface that is perpendicular to the 
sun's rays in the outer atmosphere receives 430 BTU's 
per hour. This is usually written as 430 Btu/ft2/hr. A fig-
ure like this can be misleading because not all of this 
energy makes it through to the earth's surface. 
full force, we would all be sitting in a gigantic mi-
crowave oven that would cook us — and most 
living things around us — in short order. 
A lot of solar energy is reflected off, or ab-
sorbed by, our atmosphere and bounced back 
into outer space by clouds. But those solar rays 
that hit the earth on a very clear day are, for the 
most part, parallel to each other. When there is 
haze, cloud cover, smog or dust in the air, the 
parallel pattern is broken and the rays are de-
flected off in many different directions by these 
particles of water or dust in the atmosphere. This 
is why heat and light often seem to come at us 
from all parts of the sky. "Diffuse" radiation, as 
this is called, is still very strong and is useful to us 
if we have the right kind of solar collector (Fig-
ure 8). 
After most of the strongest and most harmful 
rays have been filtered out, and a large share of 
the sun's energy has been dissipated or turned 
away, the average solar intensity on the ground is 
still 1,400 BTU's per square foot per day. That's 
enough energy in a square mile to equal the 
productivity of a large hydro-electric power plant 
(Table 4). 
There have been all kinds of mind-boggling 
statistics to describe the amount of solar energy 
that falls on us. D.S. Halacy, Jr., in The Coming of 
Age of Solar Energy, says that man consumed 
90 trillion horse-power hours of energy in 1972, 
but that in that same year 1.5 million trillion 
Figure 8. Here's what happens to the solar constant 
once solar rays hit our atmosphere: (A) 5% is reflected 
off the earth itself. (B) 20% is reflected off the clouds, 
(C) 23% reaches the ground as diffuse sunlight, (D) 
25% is absorbed in the atmosphere, and (E) only 27% 
actually reaches us as direct parallel rays.

After Wilson Clark, Energy for Survival 
Table 4. This simple table shows the average amount 
of solar energy that falls in a square-mile area in 
selected parts of the United States. In this case, the 
energy is expressed as megawatts — 1,000 kilowatts. 
A typical modern electrical power plant only generates 
a few hundred megawatts a day. Some of the largest 
manage to put out 1,000 per day. 
15 

horse-power hours of solar energy fell on Mother 
Earth. In electrical terms that would mean that for 
every square foot of earth, there would have to be 
at least 1,000 watts generated each day. 
What may be more important for the purposes 
of collecting solar energy to heat water is that the 
sun comes to us in three different forms: {1) di-
rect parallel rays; (2) diffuse radiation, which 
comes to us from all directions after being 
glanced off clouds, dust or moisture particles in 
the air; and (3) reflected radiation, which has 
been bounced straight off some surface. 
Some ultraviolet rays do get through to us. We 
can't see these rays, but our skin can feel them 
after a couple of hours on a sunny beach. Visible 
sunlight, what we think of as brightness during 
the day, has much longer wave lengths, relatively 
speaking, than ultraviolet light. If we look through 
sunlight that has been bent into a rainbow by a 
prismatic effect in the air, we see that visible light 
consists of blue, green, yellow and red hues. In-
frared rays, which give us heat, have longer wave 
lengths still, and like ultraviolet rays they are invis-
ible to us.

Wave Length in Microns (Micron = Viooo Millimeter) 
Figure 9. This strange-looking curve represents the 
"solar spectrum." Nearly everything that happens on 
earth is dependent on this narrow range of solar radia-
tion. Visible sunlight, as you can see, is most common, 
and ultraviolet rays are screened out, for the most 
part, before they reach the ground. We can't see either 
ultraviolet rays or infrared light. (After Wilson Clark, 
Energy for Survival) 
Figure 9A. When light rays are passed through a 
prism and "refracted," we can see the colors red, 
orange, yellow, green, blue indigo and violet. This is 
visible sunlight. 
The sun's energy that actually reaches us is 
about 80% visible light, 4% ultraviolet light, and 
about 16% infrared (Figure 9, 9A). A very high 
percentage of this great energy can be captured 
by you and me if we have the right equipment. 
How Does Sunlight 
Hit the Earth? 
One of the things you will have to consider as you 
make decisions about your own involvement with 
solar energy, is the latitude of your home. You 
probably don't need to be told that the farther you 
go from the equator — that imaginary line that 
slices the globe into a top half and a bottom half 
— the weaker the sun's energy becomes. 
What many people don't realize is that the 
more horizontal lines — "parallels" of latitude — 
there are on the map between you and the 
equator, the farther sunlight has to travel to reach 
you, and the more energy is lost. The reason we 
can look at the sun at sunrise and sunset is that 
we're looking at it over the curvature of the earth. 
Much of the light is being absorbed by the at-
mosphere. At noon, when the sum is more over-
head, its rays have to pass through fewer fathoms 
of air before they reach our eyes (Figure 10). 
But it's not quite so simple as that. There are 
great differences in insolation from place to 
place along the same latitude. ("Insolation" is to 
sunlight what the measurement called "rainfall" 
16 

Figure 10. This diagram suggests how latitude has an 
effect on insolation. As we go further and further from 
the equator in either direction, sunlight has to pass 
through more and more of the atmosphere to reach 
us. By the time it reaches 45 degrees north or south, 
much of its force has been stolen by the atmosphere. 
is to rain.) These differences are the result of al-
titude, local climatic conditions, and seasonal 
changes (Table 5). 
Places with little rainfall tend to be good places 
to collect an abundance of solar energy — be-
cause there are few clouds. But dusty and windy 
places are bad because the particles in the air 
block a lot of rays. Locations near the sea are apt 
to have lower insolation than places at higher 
altitudes where clouds, haze and foggy condi-
tions are less likely to rob sunshine. (Places in 
Mew England may have as many as 10 cloud-
covered days in a row, giving them a year's total 
of 40% diffuse sunlight on the average. But the 
mile-high city of Denver, Colorado, even in 
Table 5. This is a list of United States Weather Service 
Stations currently recording sunshine. As you can see, 
they are still few and far between, but there will be 
more as more of us recognize the importance of solar 
energy.

January — the worst month for sun — will have 
67% direct radiation. See Table 6). 
The best area to collect sunlight is between 15 
and 35 degrees either north or south of the 
equator, because most of the radiation is quite 
direct and there are few clouds. (It's no accident 
that this is where the world's great deserts are.) 
Next best is 15 degrees immediately below and 
above the equator, except that here there are

the least amount of sunshine. Notice that Portland, 
Oregon is sunny only 19%of the time in January, while 
Denver has direct radiation 67% of the time. 
plenty of clouds and lots of humidity in the lower 
atmosphere. Once you get beyond 35 degrees 
north or south, there's a strong effect on insola-
tion caused by changes in the seasons. This may 
be the main reason why 75% of the world's popu-
lation lives below 40 degrees north latitude and 
above 40 degrees south latitude. Beyond these 
points winter really takes its toll (Figure 11). 
Remember, the sun's rays are hitting a curved 
surface — the side of our round earth. So the 
angle at which the sun's rays hit the earth gets 
lower the further we go from the equator. (If any 
receiving surface is tilted 45 degrees away from 
directly headed rays of sunlight, the intensity of 
radiation will be only 71%. If the surface is tipped

Ray AB Longer Than CD 
60% away from the source, the radiation drops 
way down to 50% (Figure 12). 
This is why as we move further north (or south) 
we have to plan carefully how we will orient a 
solar collector in relation to the sun. We want rays 
to hit the collector at close to right angles as 
much of the time as possible. At latitudes well 
above 35 degrees, a flat plate collector that's an-
gled properly should have no trouble heating 
water to 140 degrees for at least a few hours a 
day, even in winter. As latitudes get higher, solar 
Figure 11. For all practical purposes the sun's rays 
are parallel — until they get deflected by particles in 
the atmosphere. Ray AB in this diagram is weaker by 
the time it hits the ground than ray CD. This is not only 
because AB has to pass through more air, but because 
it hits the side of the earth at a flat angle instead of 
straight on. CD, on the other hand, hits the ground at 
right angles, so its effect is felt more strongly.

Horizontal Surface 
Figure 12. There is a tremendous difference between 
the energy that is received by a surface that is square 
to the sun's rays and one that Is at an angle. This Is 
why solar collectors that are far from the equator must 
be tilted to absorb the maximum amount of radiation 
for as many hours as possible during the day. 
collectors have to be tilted more and more to-
ward vertical, because at that point a horizontal 
collector will absorb next to nothing in the way of 
heat. 
How Do the Seasons 
Affect Insolation? 
explained was that the earth moves around the 
sun at an average speed of about 18.5 miles a 
second, and that on December 21 we are about 
89.8 million miles from the sun, but 95.9 million 
miles from the sun on June 21. (This is because 
the sun isn't always in the exact center of our 
orbit.) Our childish logic might have told us that it 
should be the other way around: if we were closer 
in December, it should be warmer then — sum-
mer! 
What we also may not have understood as very 
young children, but could grasp later on, was the 
fact that the earth's axis — about which we go 
"round and round" — is tilted 23.5 degrees from 
vertical. (What we may recall most vividly from 
those early astronomy lessons is that the earth's 
axis points directly at the north star.) This axial tilt 
— not our distance from the sun — is what 
causes changes in the seasons (Figure 13). 
As we spin once a day, 365.25 times, we move 
in a path around the sun one time. (One revolu-
tion accounts for a year of what we call "time," 
and the fact that each year has an extra quarter of 
a day explains why we need a leap year once 
every 4 years.) For some reason, as we get closer 
to the sun, our speed slows down slightly and 
then quickens again as we get further away. So 
Years ago our parents or some elementary 
school teacher taught us that the earth goes 
around and around and that the sun shines on us 
from 93 million miles away. This is why we have 
day and night. What they may or may not have 
Figure 13. The earth spins on a tipped axis as it moves 
around the sun. This is why we have changes in sea-
sons. On June 21, although we are actually further 
from the sun, we are tilted toward it — that's if we live 
in the northern hemisphere. On December 21, we are 
tipped away from the sun, so its rays don't hit us di-
rectly. 

we're not always orbiting the sun at the same 
precise rate of speed. 
On June 21 — the summer solstice — we in 
the northern half of the world are tilted most to-
ward the sun so it hits us most directly. This is the 
day when we receive sunlight for the longest 
amount of time. On December 21, we are tilted 
farthest away from the sun. Then we get the 
fewest hours of sunshine and those rays we do 
get hit us at a pretty flat angle. 
On March 21 and September 21 — the spring 
and fall equinoxes — there are equal amounts of 
sunlight and darkness. The Tropic of Cancer 
(23.5 degrees north), that weird parallel on the 
globe that seems out of spacing with the other 
latitude lines, marks the point where the sun is 
directly overhead at noon on June 21. The Tropic 
of Capricorn (23.5 degrees south) describes the 
same path that most direct sunlight takes in the 
Figure 14. The Tropic of Cancer indicates the north-
ernmost point on earth where the sun can be directly 
overhead. This happens on June 21. On December 21 
It is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn. This dia-
gram shows the seasonal relationships between the 
sun and the earth. The normally recommended angle 
for a fixed solar collector is your latitude plus 10 to 15 
degrees. 
southern hemisphere on December 21. When it 
is summer in the southern half of the world, of 
course, it is winter in the north (Figure 14). 
That's how things look, theoretically at least, 
from outer space. But here on earth we're look-
ing at it from the opposite end, which gives us a 
very different perspective. What we earth beings 
see is this: On June 21 the sun appears higher in 
the sky at noon than it does at any other time of 
the year. It is higher, in relation to the horizon, 
and this angle between the horizon and the sun is 
expressed as the sun's altitude (Figure 15). 
Figure 15. We see more of the sun In June than we do 
in December. In the summer It Is not only higher In the 
sky; it is there for more hours. 
Figure 15A. The sun's position relative to the horizon 
Is called its altitude. The sun's altitude is expressed In 
degrees, not In distance.

Figure 16. X marks the spot where the sun is directly 
overhead at four different times of year. 
The sun is at its lowest altitude on December 
21 — the winter solstice. On March and Sep-
tember 21 its position in the sky is midway be-
tween the other two extremes. We not only see 
less of the sun in December because it is around 
for fewer hours, its intensity is diminished be-
cause of its low altitude. This is why we have win-
ter (Figure 16). 
Don't be confused by insolation maps like the 
one in Figure 17. Here solar energy is being 
measured and described in "Langleys" rather 
than BTU's. The Weather Service is simply using 
the language of the metric system instead of the 
old English system. A Langley is the amount of 
heat it takes to heat one gram of water one de-
gree centigrade. To convert Langleys per day to 
BTU's just multiply the number of Langleys by 
3.69 (Table 7). 
One more thing to keep in mind: Langleys are 
measured on a horizontal surface at any weather 
Before you make a commitment to a solar heat-
ing system of any kind you should study how 
much sunlight falls on your area at all times of 
the year. Solar insolation maps that are even 
more accurate than U.S. Weather Service maps 
can be found in a book called World Distribution 
of Solar Radiation, by Smith, Duffie and Lof. For 
a copy of this title write to the University of Wis-
consin, Engineering Experiment Station, 1500 
Johnson Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, and 
send them a check for $6.00. You may also get 
more specific climatic information from your 
nearest Weather Service office. And The Old 
Farmer's Almanac, although not always precise, 
is another good source of general weather data 
(Figure 17). 
Figure 17. This map, similar to one from the U.S. 
Weather Service, shows the average annual insolation 
in the continental United States. The figures are in

Weather Service give a monthly breakdown of insola-

station, meaning that a solar collector' angled di-
rectly toward the sun could be expected to pick 
up a great deal more energy at most times of the 
year than the insolation map suggests (Graph 2). 
Before you decide whether or not a solar sys-
tem is feasible, learn all you can about your local 
weather idiosyncrasies — specifically how many 
cloud-free days there are each month or how 
smoggy it gets at various times of the year. 
(Smog reduces insolation by as much as 15 to 
20%.)

you, rather than try to collect weather data your-
self. Weather monitoring equipment is expensive, 
and your reading over the course of a year or two 
will probably not be as accurate as the long-

gathered.

least an admirer) to the extent that you realize

Harvesting Energy

heliochemical conversion, because solar energy 
is being changed over to stored chemical energy. 
Gathering energy through a man-made solar col-
lector involves a heliothermal change, because 
radiation is absorbed by a black surface and 
turned into heat. This process is very simple, very 
effective, and it is what Chapter 3 is all about. 
What Are Focusing 
Solar Collectors? 
The Greek word for sun is Helios. As we all know, 
much of our English language has evolved from 
the ancient Greek, and many English words have 
Greek parts. So any word that has the prefix 
helio- probably has something to do with the 
sun. 
A helioelectrical process is a way of convert-
ing sunlight to electricity — something we're just 
learning to do efficiently. Photosynthesis, men-
tioned in the last chapter, is an example of a 
Focusing collectors — or solar concentrators as 
they're sometimes called — redirect the sun's 
parallel rays to a specific focal point or "target." 
Figure 18. A focusing — or concentrating — collector 
changes the direction of parallel solar rays so they 
zero in on a given focal point. Double convex lenses, 
such as those in magnifying glasses, do this directly. A 
parabolic mirror, on the other hand, reflects concen-
trated rays back to a target in front of the reflector. 
Either way sunlight is intensified tremendously.

24 

Anybody who has ever lit a fire with a magnifying 
glass has used a solar concentrator. A magnify-
ing glass is actually a double convex lens, which 
bends parallel rays and makes them converge on 
a central point. The bead of light thrown by the 
glass can be made hot enough — by adjusting 
the height of the glass — to ignite paper or even 
light kindling (Figure 18). 
Another common type of focusing collector is 
a parabolic mirror, a bowl-shaped reflector that 
directs solar rays to a central target right in front 
of the mirror itself. A good silvered-glass mirror 
or polished metal surface shaped like the inside 
of a car's sealed beam headlight should reflect 
about 92% of the light that hits it and shoot it all to 
one spot. The advantage of any focusing collec-
tor is that it can generate tremendous temper-
ature — as high as several thousand degrees — 
because it intensifies radiation hundreds of times 
(Figure 18A). 
But there are serious disadvantages to focus-
ing collectors. First, they must point exactly to-
ward the sun or they won't work at all. This 
means that they either have to be moved by hand 
or be hooked up to a device called a heliostatic 
mount that tracks the sun all day long. Second, 
most solar concentrators can't focus diffuse light, 
making them almost worthless when there is 
Figure 18A. The problem with focusing collectors is 
that they rely on direct radiation. They also must al-
ways face the sun. When they don't, this is the result. 
Unless the orientation of the collector is perfect, rays 
bounce everywhere except against the target. 
Figure 18B. The difference between figures A and B is 
in the curvature of the reflecting surfaces. A is what is 
called a short-focus collector because the focal point 
Is close to the reflector. It doesn't need to face the sun 
as exactly as B, but its more rounded mirror makes it 
more difficult to build. B, the long-focus collector, Is 
easier to make, but harder to operate precisely. 
haze or cloud cover. Third, focusing collectors 
are expensive to buy and complicated to build. 
(Locating that precise focal point in front of the 
reflector calls for some tricky mathematics.) 
Fourth, it's no simple matter to run a stream of 
liquid through a small focal point to heat it, with-
out affecting the optics of the collector (Fig-
ure 18B). 
There are some collectors on the market that 
get around some of these problems. The Sun-
pak® solar collector from Owens-Illinois is a 
series of glass vacuum tubes mounted in front of 
a flat reflecting surface. In a way, it's sort of a 
cross between a concentrator and a flat plate col-
lector (see appendix). The Sunpak can absorb 
both parallel and diffuse light, and can accept 
radiation from many different angles, which 
means it doesn't have to move (Figure 19). 
Cylindrical collectors are long curved reflec-
tors that intensify sunlight at a ratio as high as 72 
to 1. These focus rays on a blackened fluid pipe 
that passes in front of the collector (Figure 20). 
They are easier to make than a spherical collec-
tor; they can be as long as you like; and they don't 
need to track the sun so exactly as other types of 
concentrating collectors. 
For the most part, though, focusing collectors 
have not yet proven practical for heating domes-
tic water in any quantity. 
25 


Integral Construction 
Figure 21. Most focusing collectors must be mounted 
on a sun-tracking mechanism like this, called a helio-
static mount. Flat plate collectors will work somewhat 
better if they are attached to such a device, but most 
people think the cost is too high to justify the added 
efficiency. 
Figure 22. The liquid-carrying channels and the ab-
sorber plate in a flat plate collector should be of the 
same material if possible. Tubing can be fastened to 
the plate in one of several ways, but it's important that 
there be a good thermal bond between the two. Heat is 
best conducted to fluid through a plate which has tub-
ing as an integral part of its structure.

But try turning the faucet down, so just a small 
stream of water runs through the hose. If you run 
the water slowly enough, and the sun is hot 
enough, lukewarm water will dribble out the other 
end of the hose for as long as the sun is strong. 
The slower the water is run, and the longer the 
hose is, the warmer the water will be. That's how 
flat plate collectors work — only better. 
Two things make the collector a more efficient 
heat trap than the garden hose: (1) The metal 
collector and its tubes can get much hotter than 
the plastic hose and the grass beneath it, and (2) 
the collector plate — sometimes called the ab-
sorber plate — is covered with glass to hold the 
heat in (Figure 23). 
Flat plate collectors normally operate at tem-
peratures much lower than focusing collectors — 
somewhere between 100 and 210 degrees 
Fahrenheit. But they should be able to withstand 
temperatures a good deal higher than this. Much 
of the heat that's received by the absorber plate is 
transferred to the fluid passing through. It might 
be anywhere from 130 to 210 degrees, depend-
ing on how fast it is flowing in the collector chan-
nels. 
One square foot of collector surface may ab-
sorb 700 BTU's of energy or more on a sunny 
day. A typical flow rate is about one gallon per 
hour for every square foot of absorber plate. So a 
24-square-foot collector in a pumped system 
should heat at least 24 gallons of water at least 
one degree in an hour's time — and probably 
more. 
The absorber plate itself is usually surrounded 
by a metal or wooden box which is enclosed on 
top by glass or some other form of "glazing." 
27 

1st Glazing 
Figure 23. This inexpensive solar water heater is de-
scribed by Farrington Daniels in Direct Use of the 
Sun's Energy. The 6-foot by 4-foot box sits in ground 
which has been dug out slightly. Polyethylene film is 
laid in the tray to hold water, and a black plastic sheet 
is laid over the top of the 2-inch deep water layer. A 
second wooden frame covered with a plastic like Ted¬ 
lar or Mylar fits snugly over the top of the first. The air 
space between the upper cover and the black plastic 
makes a good heat trap. Such a heater can heat 5 gal-
lons of water in about 3 hours. Once it Is heated, the 
water is syphoned out of the box. 
2nd Glazing 
(Optional) 
Absorber Plate 
with Tubing 
nsulation 
Figure 24. This is an exploded view of a flat plate col-
lector. The critical element is the absorber plate — in 
this case the tube-in-sheet type. The absorber is cov-
ered with one or more layers of glazing, and rests on a 
layer of insulation. All of these components are sur-
rounded by a box made of metal or wood. 
(This glazing might be fiberglass or plastic in-
stead of glass.) Under the absorber plate there is 
usually a layer of insulation to keep heat from es-
caping through the under side of the collector 
(Figure 24). 
The glazing allows visible short wave-length 
light to pass through to the absorber plate and 
prevents passing air currents from drawing off 
much of the collector's heat (Figure 25). But 
what's even more important is that the glazing 
keeps some longer wave-length radiation from 
escaping back into the atmosphere. It is this 
property of glass — and of some types of 
fiberglass 
and 
plastic 
— 
that 
creates 
a 
"greenhouse effect" inside the collector. 
Everybody knows what it's like to get into a 
closed car on a sunny day. The heat can be un-
bearable. Any enclosed space behind glass — 
whether it be the inside of a car, a greenhouse, or 
a solar collector — gathers and holds considera-
ble amounts of heat. Short wave-length sunlight 
comes through the glass and is either absorbed 
by, or reflected off walls, floors, car seats . . . or 
collector plates (Figure 26). 
Rays that are reradiated cannot pass back 
through the glass to the outside because their 
wave length is made longer once they hit some 
surface. In other words, a ray that's bounced off 
an absorber plate has longer wave lengths than it 
did before it hit. These longer-wave rays reflect 
off the inside of the glass and bounce back and 
forth inside the air space. In this way a little radia-
tion can become a lot of heat (Figure 27). 
So there are four factors that affect the amount 
of heat captured by a flat plate collector: (1) the 
solar intensity — "insolation," (2) the collector's 
orientation toward the sun, (3) the temperature of 
the air surrounding the collector — call the am-
bient air — and (4) the materials used in the col-
lector itself, specifically the quality of the glazing 
and the material selected for the key component, 
the absorber plate (Figure 28). 
Absorber plates are most commonly made of 
copper or aluminum, because these metals do a 
28 

Absorber Plate 
Insulation 
Figure 25. In cross-section a flat plate collector might 
look like this. The glazing keeps passing air currents 
from robbing heat from the absorber plate. If a collec-
tor is fairly airtight, the small amount of air beneath 
the glass should be quite hot. 
Figure 26-27. A flat plate collector works much like a 
greenhouse. Rays come through the glass, reflect off 
walls and the floor of the greenhouse, but can't es-
cape back to the atmosphere. When short wave-length 
rays hit the absorber plate, some of their energy may 
be reradiated back, but their intensity is weakened — 
meaning that the wave lengths are made longer. Be-
cause they can't pass back through the glazing, they 
hit the absorber again and again, giving the plate sev-
eral chances to absorb them. 
Figure 28. Basic solar water heaters like this have 
been used for more than 30 years in Japan. The lined 
tray is filled with water in the morning and left in the 
sun during the day. At night it is emptied and used by 
the family. In some cases a three-legged box which 
can be tilted toward the sun is used. Although this is 
more efficient, it obviously must be made watertight 
so it doesn't leak when tipped, 
29 

Figure 29. A very inexpensive commercial solar water 
heater is made by the Hitachi Company of Japan. It is 
really little more than a black polyvinyl water pillow on 
a wooden platform. The heater is mounted on a 
south-facing roof, and holds about 50 gallons of 
water. In the winter the black pillow is covered with a 
clear plastic canopy to allow more heat to collect. 
better job of conducting heat than, say, steel. 
(Silver is the best heat-conducting metal of all, 
but its price obviously makes it out of the ques-
tion.) Panels with plastic collector plates and no 
glazing, by the way, are designed only to heat 
swimming pool water a few degrees, and are in 
no way suitable for heating domestic hot water. 
They will disintegrate at the temperatures a 
domestic hot water heater must reach (Fig-
ure 29). 
How Efficient 
Are Flat Plate Collectors? 
The easiest way to understand solar collector ef-
ficiency is to think in reverse. Don't think so 
much about the water temperature as about the 
temperature of the collector itself. The whole sys-
tem is like a water-cooled engine in a car. When 
the circulating water — cooled by the car's 
radiator — keeps the engine running at a rea-
sonably cool temperature, everything is thought 
to be working efficiently. 
The same is true of the solar collector. If water 
or antifreeze fluid is running through the ab-
sorber plate fast enough to keep it cool, most of 
the heat is being transferred to the water and 
things are working fine. If the water runs too 
slowly, and the collector gets hot, there is obvi-
ously a lot of inefficient heat loss. 
In a sense, hot water is just a by-product of the 
cooling process. The trick then, is to regulate the 
flow so that more water is heated — even though 
its heated temperature is lower than it would be if 
the flow rate were slower. When this is the case — 
the absorber is being kept cool, and the water is 
hot — the collector is said to be in a healthy state 
of "equilibrium." 
The exact efficiency of a solar collector is fig-
ured by comparing the amount of energy that's 
actually absorbed by the plate to the amount of 
energy that's falling on the collector. A simple 
equation would look like this: 
efficiency = — 
energy falling 
If 1200 BTG's of energy a day fall on a square 
foot of collector surface, and the square foot of 
the absorber plate absorbs 700 BTU's, the equa-
tion becomes: 
If this seems pretty academic, it is. This is be-
cause as a homeowner, you probably have no 
way accurately to measure BTU's to come up 
with an exact percentage like this (Graph 3). 
Since a collector's efficiency relates directly to 
its running temperature there are ways to check 
out quickly how things are going. For example, if 
the glazing feels very hot to the touch, water may 
be circulating too slowly. If one collector in an 
array of panels if overheating — or even if part of 
a collector is hotter than another part — there 
may be blockage somewhere in the fluid pas-
sages. Usually this will be an air bubble, and air 
locks like this can be avoided with special plumb-
ing devices.

the roof rises 3 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal 
distance. This table can help you make conversions 
from one to the other. A 2-on-12 pitch is roughly 
equivalent to 10 degrees of steepness, while a 12-on-
12 pitch is equal to 45 degrees. On some solar homes 
roof pitch may be greater than 45 degrees. 
possible roof leakage and wind damage. A collec-
tor that gets mounted on a "prop" can act like a 
sail, exerting tremendous strain on itself, the roof, 
and its mounting, it would be no fun at all to 
come out your door one morning and find your 
expensive solar collectors shattered across the 
front lawn (Figure 43). 
The best compromise, if your roof is anywhere 
near the correct pitch, is to mount the collector 
panels flat, and either add more collectors or 
solar reflectors. In short, if your roof is much too 
flat, think about making tilt adjustments only if 
you're willing to build an exceptionally strong 
supporting structure for the panels. 
How Much Do Solar 
Reflectors Help? 
Reflector panels which bounce rays back onto a 
collector should reduce the amount of collector 
surface you need. In fact, a small collector can 
receive more radiation than a much bigger one if 
it's helped by properly arranged reflection sur-
faces. Good reflectors should boost the perfor-
mance of any flat plate collector by at least 25% 
(figure 44). 
Figure 43. When the ridge of a house runs north and 
south, it can be difficult to design a collector system 
that works well without having to use many panels on 
both the east and west roofs. A cheaper alternative 
might be to plan a simple addition with a shed roof 
that puts the collectors at just the right tilt.

reflector panels can be made to work in combination. 
Reflectors can increase the performance of flat plate 
collectors by 25% or more. It's best, of course, if the 
reflector is adjustable, so it can be moved to shed light 
on the collector at all times of the year.

Figure 31. A thermosyphon solar water heater uses a

the system. 
efficient, but it requires a thermostatic control 
mechanism to turn the pump off when the sun is 
too weak to give the collector energy. 
The upward flow of liquid through a solar panel 
can be directed in a couple of different ways. The 
tubing, which is integral with the plate itself, 
might be a single line that zig-zags across the 
absorber like a serpent. Experts refer to this as a 
series pattern. The advantage of this flow path is 
that the liquid takes a long route through the 
collector and gets quite hot. The plumbing in-
volved also is quite simple (Figure 32). 
In a parallel flow collector, fluid comes into 
the bottom of the panel through a single in-flow 
manifold, then is diverted through a number of 
parallel tubes for one pass across the collector 
plate, before it's re-collected again in the out-flow 
manifold (Figure 33). Most prefabricated tube-
in-sheet absorber plates are designed to use this 
flow pattern. Although liquid spends somewhat 
less time in the collector — and is heated less per 
pass as a result — more heat will be collected in a 
day's time. 
The third type of collector — the open-water 
type — has an absorber plate made of corru-
gated steel or aluminum roofing material. Open 
water collectors are called ticklers in the solar 
trade because water starts at the top of the panel 
and trickles down the open channels in the cor-
rugations. 
The best-known panel of this type is the 
Thomason collector, developed some years ago 
in Washington, D.C. The whole Thomason sys-
tem is well protected by patents, but the collector 
works very simply. Cold water is pumped to 
headers along the ridge of the house above the

est to put together and gets water hottest.

it's more complex, causes less pressure loss in the

collectors. It then seeps from carefully spaced 
holes in the header and runs slowly down the 
black metal absorber plate (Figures 34-35). 
At the bottom of the corrugated sheet there is a 
gutter to collect the water which has taken heat 
from the sun. This gutter runs into a pipe, which 
in turn, transports the water to the storage tank. 
Variations on the open-water collector include 
the "series dribble" system (Figure 36), which 
directs water back and forth across the collector 
plate, and the Shore system, which runs water 
between two sheets of blackened corrugated 
roofing. There is apt to be lots of evaporation 
from the open-water in a trickier and this can

the one designed by Thomason (top), starts at the top 
of the collector and runs to the bottom. The water Is 
heated as it runs down valleys in black corrugated 
roofing.

cause condensation on the underside of the glaz-
ing. The Shore collector, with its double layer of 
roofing, is better in this respect. 
Flat plate collectors, for the most part, are 
either ready-made or built at home. The 
homemade varieties are built from scratch or put 
together from a kit. Prefabricated collectors tend 
to be expensive, as we have already seen. If you're 
an amateur plumber, you may want to start at 
ground zero and make collectors entirely on your 
own. If not, you may opt to buy the collector plate 
but build the rest of the collector box yourself. It's 
simple, really. All you have to worry about is keep-
ing the collector box watertight (more on this in 
Chapter 5). The third option would be to build 
your collector completely from ready-made parts 
— available from several manufacturers. (See 
appendix.) 
Whatever you decide to do, build or buy collec-
tors that are small enough and light enough to be 
handled easily. Remember, there's a big differ-
ence between moving a panel on level ground 
and getting it into place up there on the roof. If 
the collector is too unwieldy, mounting it properly 
becomes a balancing act and a wrestling match 
all rolled into one.

CHAPTER 4 
bound to see more of this kind of municipal 
planning in the future. Are local building codes 
such that whoever built your house put in a 
strong rafter system to support the roof and the 
extra weight of solar panels? 
Designing Your 
Collector System 
As you get more and more tuned into the sun as 
a source of energy, you have to consider all the 
angles — literally. You should be aware of the rel-
ative angle of the sun to the horizon — at various 
times of day and at different times of year. It 
changes constantly, as you know. You also need 
to be conscious of how you, your dwelling, your 
landscaping and your solar collector system 
stand in relation to the sun. Here the angles be-
come critical. 
Spend some time taking an overall look at your 
home site, and plan the location of your solar 
collectors accordingly. They will probably be 
placed in one of three ways: (1) attached to an 
existing building — the roof of the house, maybe; 
(2) detached from the building — on the ground, 
perhaps; or (3) integrated with the building itself. 
Making the collectors part of the actual structure 
is tough, unless you build a new house or at least 
an addition. If you are starting a new home, you 
may want to consult an architect who can help 
design a house that is in itself a large solar collec-
tor (Figure 37). 
Here is a brief checklist of things to consider as 
you plan a new site or examine one you already 
have: 
1. Building Codes and Zoning Laws. Do you 
need a building permit just to install solar panels 
on your roof? Some places require it Can you do 
some selective cutting or pruning of trees on 
your lot to let in more sunlight? Some forward-
looking communities are now zoned with "sun 
rights," meaning that no one can block the sun's 
right-of-way to your house. Is yours? We're 
2. Solar Interference. What obstacles are 
there that could prevent the sun from shining on 
your collectors? Can they be removed? Take a 
long look (and a short look) in every direction 
sunlight could possibly come from, checking the 
height of the obstructions against the distance 
from the collectors (Figure 38). The best time to 
do this is in December when the sun is at its low-
est altitude in the sky. Ideally, the spot where you 
put collectors should have 6 to 8 hours of possi-
ble sunshine every day. 
Deciduous (broadleal) trees some distance 
from the house may not be such a problem as 
you think. The sun may pass above them in the 
summer, and come through them in winter

Figure 37. Most flat plate solar collectors are 
mounted on rooftops. Ground-mounted collectors 
have certain disadvantages, in that they get covered 
with snow, are more easily shaded, and can be harmed 
by vandals. Sometimes a roof is too flat to support col-
lectors faced properly toward the sun. When this is so, 
they have to be tilted at a better angle, and anchored 
very firmly so they don't shift in the wind. 
34 

Figure 38. As you plan your solar system, take a close 
look at the site. What about mountains, hills, trees and 
other buildings? Can they interfere with incoming 
solar radiation? If it's not possible for the sun to shine 
on your collectors for at least 6 hours a day, a solar 
system may be hard to justify. 
when there's no foliage. Evergreens, however, 
block more sunshine and cast the heaviest 
shadow. Some may have to be sacrificed. 
3. Determination of True South. Is there a 
way to mount your collectors to face directly at — 
or close to — true south? "True" south is marked 
by the position of the sun at solar noon — which 
shouldn't be confused with noon on the clock. 
When the sun is halfway between its position at 
sunrise and its position at sunset, it indicates true 
south. The easiest way to find true south is to 
consult a local map for the magnetic variation 
where you are. More on this shortly. 
4. Direction of Prevailing Winds. Will cold 
winds that blow across your solar collectors steal 
too much heat? Can they be sheltered from the 
wind but still be exposed to the sun? Can you 
build some sort of windscreen to protect your 
panels? 
Heat loss from a single square foot of collector 
averages 2.5 BTU's per hour when the temper-
ature difference between the inside of the panel 
and the outside is just one degree Fahrenheit. 
That's if the collector has no glazing. With one 
layer of glass the heat loss is 1.3 BTU's per 
square foot per hour, and with 2 layers it drops to 
0.7 BTU's per square foot per hour. Imagine what 
heat loss would be if the temperature difference 
were 120 degrees! And when there is wind, the 
"chill factor" increases heat loss by almost a de-
gree for every mile an hour of breeze. Keep that 
in mind. 
5. Snow Depth. Will snow cover your collec-
tors? Study the roof for a winter to see. Snow 
slides off roof-mounted solar collectors if the roof 
is steep enough, but it can drift and settle into the 
valleys where roofs come together. Collectors 
that are tucked into shaded corners like this can 
be obscured from the sunlight (Figure 39). 
Figure 39. Snow tends to drift and accumulate in roof 
valleys, so it's not a good idea to mount solar collec-
tors too close to where two or more roofs join. Study 
the sunlight patterns on your house at different times 
of day and at various times of year. Sometimes one 
part of a house will shade another. Obviously you'll 
want your collectors in the sunniest possible spot. 
35 

Ground-mounted collectors make little sense 
where it's very cold and there's lots of snow. Not 
only are they covered much of the time, they're 
usually far enough from the house that hot water 
has to travel a long way to reach the storage tank 
inside. Every inch of distance means potential 
heat loss — even if the pipes are insulated and 
buried in the ground. To make matters worse, 
panels that sit on the ground can be trip-over 
hazards and attractive targets for rock-throwing 
vandals. 
6. Aesthetics. Is your panel arrangement 
going to look tacky somehow? Don't forget a 
basic rule of human nature: If it doesn't "look 
right" you'll never be satisfied. 
Where Should Solar 
Collectors Be Pointed? 
Before orienting your solar collectors, get your'-
self oriented as accurately as you can. Use a 
compass to find magnetic north, keeping in mind 
that it is not exactly the same as "true" north. To 
know the "variation" between true north and 
magnetic north, either look at a recent G.S. map 
that shows the magnetic variation, or call the 
United States Coast Guard or the geography de-
partment at the nearest university. If you're sure 
there's no magnetic field nearby — such as a 
power plant or high-tension electrical lines — 
that could throw your compass off, make the ad-
justment for magnetic variation and find true 
north. True south, naturally, is 180 degrees from 
true north. In the southern hemisphere, of 
course, the directions are reversed. 
When you get to the point of aligning your 
solar panels, or designing a new roof to accomo-
date them, the word is, "Pretty close is close 
enough." Even if you face your collectors as 
much as 25 degrees out of perpendicular with a 
true north-south line, you still get over 90% of the 
possible radiation (Table 8). In other words, if 
your roof doesn't face exactly the right way, don't 
panic (Figures 40A, B, & C). 
Actually, being off by-15 degrees or so may be

to install in cabins and summer cottages, and should 
cost next to nothing. Some campers have discovered 
that a coil of black garden hose covered with 
polyethylene can provide a free hot shower on a sunny 
day. 
an advantage — especially if the deviation is to 
the southwest instead of toward the southeast. 
Morning sun in the east is often hampered by fog 
or haze, and air surrounding a collector is apt to 
be 15 degrees warmer in the afternoon when the 
sun is more westerly. We already know that 
warmer ambient air means less heat loss. 
Make a few trial runs with your collectors be-
fore you actually mount them on the roof. Prop 
them up on the ground at noon, angled so they 
cast the smallest possible shadow. Then run 
water through them by temporarily rigging up a 
garden hose. Later, for a more accurate orienta-
tion, make a simple block and dowel device like 
the one in Figure 41. Advice for mounting collec-
tors permanently on a roof comes up shortly.

Table 8. As you can see from this table, collector effi-
ciency doesn't fall off dramatically even if the panel is 
misaligned by as much as 20 degrees. If you have a 
choice, it is better to point collectors southwest by 15 
degrees or so than it is to point them southeast.

How Should a Solar 
Collector Be Tilted? 
Don't confuse orientation with tilt Orientation 
describes the direction the panel faces, while tilt 
describes its angle of inclination. Tilt is a little 
more touchy. Ideally the collector should be at 
right angles — 90 degrees — to incoming solar 
rays, but this can't happen all the time if the panel 
stays in a fixed position. After all, the difference 
between the sun's altitude in June and its altitude 
in December is 47 degrees. Keep in mind that 
whenever sunbeams hit a collector at less than a 
30-degree angle, the collector reflects off more 
radiation than it absorbs (Figure 42). 
In North America roof pitch seems to get flatter 
and flatter as you travel further south. This is ob-
viously because houses up north have more 
snowload in winter. Snow is a consideration for 
37 

Figure 41. Here is a simple method for setting solar 
collectors at the best possible orientation and tilt. The 
target block can be taped against the collector glazing 
as different positions are tried. To determine the best 
position for a permanent mounting, this should be 
done at solar noon —not noon on the clock. When the 
dowel casts no shadow on the target, alignment is as 
nearly perfect as possible. 
solar collectors, as we already know. If snow is to 
avalanche off a collector consistently, it must be 
tilted not less than 40 degrees from the horizon-
tal. 
An informal rule among architects is that roof 
pitch should be equivalent to the latitude of the 
homesite minus 10 degrees. (If you live at a 
latitude of 35 degrees North, your house might 
have a roof pitch of 25 degrees — although this 
formula is not hard and fast, especially with more 
modern homes.) Determine the actual roof pitch 
of your house either by going out on the roof with 
a long carpenter's level and a large protractor, or 
by referring back to the original blueprints to look 
up the roof pitch. (Table 9 will help you convert 
pitch in inches per foot — the indication on most 
blueprints — to degrees of steepness.) 
Most authorities agree that ideal collector pitch 
for solar space heating — not hot water heating 
Collector on Roof 
Figure 42. A flat plate collector is most efficient when 
it intercepts rays at right angles. Once it's mounted in 
place it's impossible to keep the collector perpendicu-
lar to incoming rays at all times. So a compromise 
position has to be found. The angle between the radia-
tion line and a line perpendicular to the collector is 
called the angle of incidence. As the angle of inci-
dence increases, the collector's efficiency decreases. 
— is the latitude of the home site plus 10 to 15 
degrees. In other words, if you live at 35 degrees 
N. your collectors should be tilted at 45 or 50 
degrees for winter solar space heating. (You can 
find your latitude, by the way, by looking at any 
road map.) As you go farther north, roofs need to 
be almost vertical. What all of this means is that 
the normal roof pitch is about 20.degrees off of 
the ideal tilt for maximum wintertime solar collec-
tion. 
Don't be disheartened. For heating water only 
— not living space, now — a solar collector tilt 
equal to your latitude is just about right, since 
we're trying to make hot water in summer as well 
as winter. To say it another way, solar water heat-
ing calls for a flatter tilt What you do have to de-
cide is whether you want to leave your collectors 
flush with the roof — at a slightly wrong angle for 
optimum efficiency, perhaps — or to make tilt 
adjustments. Experience has shown that it's bet-
ter in most cases to leave collectors flat on the 
roof, even if it means more panels. 
If you lift the top end of the panel many de-
grees off the roof you are leaving yourself open to

Table 9. Architects, contractors and solar engineers 
sometimes express roof pitch differently. Instead of 
stating the pitch In degrees they often think in terms of 
inches per foot. A three-on-twelve pitch means that 
the roof rises 3 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal 
distance. This table can help you make conversions 
from one to the other. A 2-on-12 pitch is roughly 
equivalent to 10 degrees of steepness, while a 12-on-
12 pitch is equal to 45 degrees. On some solar homes 
roof pitch may be greater than 45 degrees. 
possible roof leakage and wind damage. A collec-
tor that gets mounted on a "prop" can act like a 
sail, exerting tremendous strain on itself, the roof, 
and its mounting, it would be no fun at all to 
come out your door one morning and find your 
expensive solar collectors shattered across the 
front lawn (Figure 43). 
The best compromise, if your roof is anywhere 
near the correct pitch, is to mount the collector 
panels flat, and either add more collectors or 
solar reflectors. In short, if your roof is much too 
flat, think about making tilt adjustments only if 
you're willing to build an exceptionally strong 
supporting structure for the panels. 
How Much Do Solar 
Reflectors Help? 
Reflector panels which bounce rays back onto a 
collector should reduce the amount of collector 
surface you need. In fact, a small collector can 
receive more radiation than a much bigger one if 
it's helped by properly arranged reflection sur-
faces. Good reflectors should boost the perfor-
mance of any flat plate collector by at least 25% 
(figure 44). 
Figure 43. When the ridge of a house runs north and 
south, it can be difficult to design a collector system 
that works well without having to use many panels on 
both the east and west roofs. A cheaper alternative 
might be to plan a simple addition with a shed roof 
that puts the collectors at just the right tilt. 
Figure 44. Sometimes banks of solar collectors and 
reflector panels can be made to work in combination. 
Reflectors can increase the performance of flat plate 
collectors by 25% or more. It's best, of course, if the 
reflector is adjustable, so it can be moved to shed light 
on the collector at all times of the year. 
39 

To work best, reflectors should be mounted 
above collectors in winter — so they receive rays 
from a low angle and throw them back onto the 
absorber plate — and below collectors in sum-
mer when the radiation is coming from a much 
higher angle. 
Shiny aluminum mounted on plywood makes 
a fine reflector, but aluminum is fairly expensive 
and not easy to stick to wood. Glossy white 
enamel paint will work nearly as well. Best of all 
are aluminized Mylar sheets that reflect beauti-
fully and can be glued to plywood. 
If you decide to make moveable reflectors, 
build them to be sturdy. Overbuild them, in fact 
They're going to stick up in the wind and will 
need to be braced every which-way. If you hinge 
the top or the bottom of the reflector panel, buy 
the biggest, heaviest strap hinges you can find 
(Figure 45). 
Figure 45. Light comes off a reflector surface at 
exactly the same angle that it hits. In winter radiation 
comes from a lower angle than it does in the summer, 
so ideally a collector should have reflectors both 
above and below it. Reflector panels are apt to be very 
exposed and can take a tremendous beating from the 
wind. They should be well built, braced and guyed. 
When you get ready to adjust the angle of the 
reflector in relation to the collector, do it some-
time around noon. Remember that rays will re-
flect off it at an angle equal to the angle of the 
incoming rays. In other words, if radiation strikes 
the reflector at a 45-degree angle, it will also 
come off at a 45-degree angle, meaning that the 
reflector and the collector should be in a 90-
degree relationship. (Usually a relationship in the 
range of 90 to 105 degrees is acceptable — it 
doesn't have to be exact.) 
And remember what was said a few pages 
back: if solar rays hit a collector panel at less than 
30 degrees, most of the energy is being reflected 
off the collector glazing and wasted. Moveable re-
flectors then, can insure that sunlight hits the col-
lectors at a favorable angle all year long. Because 
there's no delicate plumbing attached to the re-
flector, it is a whole lot easier to adjust than the 
collector itself. 
Some reflector panels are designed to do dou-
ble duty as insulating covers that close over the 
collectors at night and on cold cloudy days. 
These can be made with styrofoam or urethane 
insulation, fastened to a plywood backing that is 
framed with 2 by 4's. (The waterproof adhesive 
that's used to stick modern wall panelling to old 
walls works great for fastening foam insulation to 
plywood, by the way. It comes in a tube that fits in 
a regular caulking gun, and is sold under many 
brand names.) 
Keep half an eye out for other natural or 
man-made reflecting surfaces around you. It may 
be possible to get reflected radiation, off a 
neighboring metal roof or a nearby pond, lake or 
swimming pool. And snow may be the greatest 
reflector of all, even though winter seems to con-
tradict the whole idea of increased collector effi-
ciency. 
Dr. Harry Thomason, the man who developed 
a solar heating system using the "trickling" col-
lector mentioned in the last chapter, tells of how 
astonished he was one cold snowy morning 
shortly after his solar home in Washington, D.C. 
was finished. He called his wife from the office for 
a routine check on how the system was working. 
To his surprise she reported that water coming 
off' the collectors was several degrees hotter than 
it had been the day before — when the temper-
ature of the outside air was a good deal warmer. 
40 

He thought she must be mistaken, and asked her 
to check again. She came back on the phone 
with the same report. He concluded that the col-
lectors were generating more heat because more 
photons were hitting them after reflecting off the 
snow. He was right. 
How Should Solar 
Collectors Be Mounted? 
If you plan to build your own collectors, you may 
want to go on to the next chapter first and then 
come back to this section. But before getting too 
specific about construction details, let's discuss 
some general things to consider when mounting 
solar collectors on a roof. 
It's obviously important to know the size of the 
collectors you're going to mount They'll proba-
bly be somewhere between 24 and 36 square 
feet in size. It's also important to know what 
they're all going to weigh. To be on the safe side, 
figure that a typical solar collector weighs be-
tween 2.5 and 3 pounds per square foot (If a col-
lector has two layers of glazing — and they're 
both glass — it could weigh somewhat more 
than this.) That means that a 24-square-foot 
panel with just one glazing — say 3 feet by 8 feet 
— will weigh about 75 pounds. A panel that is 32 
feet square should weigh about 100 pounds. 
(Glazing, by the way, especially if you use glass, 
should be installed only after everything else is in 
place on the roof.) 
Once you have figured the total weight of your 
collectors — by multiplying their total square 
footage by 3 pounds — take a quick look at your 
rafter or truss structure. Most rafters in northern 
areas are more than adequate to support the roof 
and the additional weight of solar collectors and a 
heavy snow load. But if you have any doubt, 
check with a local carpenter, contractor or build-
ing inspector. 
All he'll need to know is the length and size of 
the rafter beams ( 2 x 4, 2 x 6, 2 x 8, 2 x l0's 
or whatever), how far apart the rafters are spaced 
(12 inches, 16 inches, 24 inches, etc.), the total 
weight of the collectors, and the pitch and nature 
of the existing roof (shingles, metal, slate and so 
on). The inspector can tell you — possibly over 
the phone — if and how much additional rein-
forcement you'll need. 
What he's most likely to say is that the weight 
of the collectors is even lighter than a moderate 
to heavy snowload on your roof, and not to worry. 
If he does express some concern, making the 
roof strong enough may be just a matter of put-
ting in some extra support posts and tie beams, 
and "sistering" the rafters or trusses — beefing 
them up with some additional lumber. 
In some cases where a system is going to be 
installed at a very northerly latitude, collectors 
may be mounted vertically on a wall to be as-
sisted by reflection from snow. Wall-mounted col-
lectors can be quite efficient in wintertime, but 
almost worthless in summer unless they're 
rigged with a reflector. They should be fastened 
with enough support so their weight puts no 
strain on the piping that's coming and going 
from them. In other words, don't try to hang them 
by their own plumbing (Figure 46).

Hinged Reflector on Ground 
Figure 46. Some wall-mounted collectors work well in 
northern latitudes in winter. They accept the sunlight 
from a low altitude during the coldest months, but may 
need a reflector that can be elevated In summer if they 
are to receive enough radiation from a higher angle. 
Insulated reflectors can be designed to fold over the 
collector panels to protect them from cold and driving

As a matter of fact, any collector should be 
mounted as solidly as possible, so it has no 
chance to shift and snap a plumbing connection 
somewhere. This may mean toenailing through 
the collector box and into the roof, screwing the 
panels in place, or using heavy galvanized lag 
screws and angle brackets to anchor the panel. 
Either way, don't be timid about making the 
mounting as strong as you can (Figure 47). 
You'll also need to make sure the header pipes 
running to and from the collectors are absolutely 
level — as are the tops of the panels themselves. 
Otherwise there will not be even water flow 
through all the water channels in the collectors. 
This may call for some precision shimming in 
Aluminum Flashing 
Figure 47. The collector box — often made of 2x6's — 
is sometimes toenailed to the roof sheathing with 10-
penny or even 16-penny galvanized nails. Water must 
be kept out of the collector box so its top and sides 
should be protected by aluminum flashing. The out-
side of the wooden box itself should be painted with a 
high-quality exterior paint or wood preservative. Don't 
paint the inside because the paint may react poorly to 
heat, vaporize and fog the inside of the cover glazing. 
places, so bring along your level and maybe a few 
tapered cedar shingles. They shim better than 
anything else, as any carpenter will testify. 
Once the collectors are installed and fastened 
to a "fare-thee-well," they'll have to be made 
leakproof by adding bendable aluminum sheet-
ing called flashing. Begin flashing at the bottom 
of the collectors, work up along the sides, and 
then across the top. Be sure there's generous 
overlap at all the flashing joints. The upper piece 
always laps over the lower piece (Figure 48). 
Tuck the top piece of flashing under the first 
course of shingles (or other roofing material) 
above the top of the collectors. Any roofing nails 
that are driven through the aluminum flashing — 
and you should try to use as few nails as possible 
— should be smeared with asphalt roofing ce-
ment so water can't seep in past the nail heads. 
People sometimes ask if one type of roofing or 
roofing color is better than another around solar 
collectors. Some experts claim that a shiny metal 
roof reflects some light and encourages snow to 
slide off more easily. Others argue that a black 
asphalt paper or black shingled roof absorbs 
more radiation, melts snow, and raises the tem-
f)erature of the ambient air near the collector on a 
very still day. When you come right down to it, 
though, surrounding roof color and texture have 
very little effect on a collector's performance. 
Glass on collectors can be protected from hail, 
falling branches and rocks if you lay hardware 
cloth over the top. But avoid this if you can. It will 
reduce the collector's performance by about 7%. 
How you actually organize the collectors on the 
roof will depend a lot on their size, how many you 
have, how big the roof is, what is the most con-
venient way to make plumbing connections, and 
whatever obstructions there may be up there. For 
example, you may have to work around chim-
neys, vent pipes, stove pipes, dormers, and 
maybe even a TV antenna. These obstacles will 
have an effect on how you arrange the plumbing 
to move the fluid to and from the collectors. 
If your roof is simple and doesn't demand a 
fancy layout, you can take the most obvious ap-
proach —end feeding. In this case water goes in 
one end of the lower header and out the opposite 
end of the upper header pipe. Again, with this 
type of installation it's vital that the lower header

Figure 48. Installing flashing neatly and well is a tricky 
process. The aluminum material is easy to cut with 
tinsnips, but it will bend, dent and kink in all the wrong 
places unless you work with it carefully. Here is how to 
fit flashing around the top and bottom corners of the 
collector box. Remember that a top piece must always 
lap over a lower one. If you leave plenty of overlap, you 
can't go wrong. 
be horizontal. If the headers are going to serve 
several panels in a line, they must, of course, be 
straight as well. Little dips and humps in these 
pipes can cause all kinds of trouble as time goes 
on. 
The other option is to use center tee feeding. 
Here water is fed to the roof collectors at the 
center — between panels on either side. A "tee" 
fitting divides the flow of water to both sets of 
panels. The problem that can develop is that you 
get an uneven flow of water if the tee somehow 
diverts more water to one side than the other. 
(The tee is not a regulator, remember.) (Figure 
49, 49A.) 
To know if there is uneven water flow watch the 
temperature of the collectors on either side of the 
divide. When one gets a lot warmer to the touch 
than the other, it's not getting as much water cir-
culation. This dilemma is easy to prevent if you 
use a little foresight Install agate valve — like an 
in-line faucet — on either side of the tee, so you 
can regulate the amount of water flow. Turn one 
or both up or down to keep an equal amount of 
water feeding to either side. 
One last important thought before leaving this 
subject for something else: Leaving a collector 
stagnant in the sun — with no fluid running 
through it — is a sure way to destroy an expen-
sive piece of equipment When you get your col-
lectors installed and glazed, cover them with a 
tarp or some scrap pieces of plywood until they 
are fully plumbed, connected to the storage tank, 
and ready to operate. It'll save lots of grief later 
on. 
43 

Figure 49. These are the two most typical header ar-
rangements. End feeding brings water into the collec-
tors at one side and out the other. Another arrange-
ment splits water at a central "tee", sending it to panel 
arrays on either side. Some valves may have to be in-
stalled to keep the water flow equal on both sides. In 
cold climates, of course, the plumbing may not be ex-
posed as it appears in this illustration.

INSTALLING 
COLLECTOR PANELS 
This procedure is a little more intricate than ordinary mounting methods. 
This is because the top and bottom header boxes have outside pieces that 
require a bevel cut, which should be done on a table saw. Even so, the end 
result is neat, simple-looking, and relatively trouble-free. 
It will work on either new or old houses. If it's a new house, a layer of 
waterproof roofing — asphalt roofing paper, for example — should be laid on 
the roof sheathing first. Only a few inches of overlap are necessary, rather 
than the traditional half lap. The roof beneath the solar collectors must of 
course be waterproof, but it won't have to stand up to extreme weather 
exposure. On an old house that's being "retrofitted" to solar collectors, the 
panels can be laid right over the old shingles or other roofing. 
Before you start, you'll need a set of carpenter's staging brackets so you 
can work safely on the roof. These are common items that you should be 
able to rent locally. 
Figure 50 
1. The first step is to lay out the complete 
collector array on the roof, using a carpen-
ter's chalk line as in Figure 50. This Is to 
get everything centered, and to be sure 
that plans you've sketched on paper will 
work out in practice. On older houses the 
roof surface may not be perfectly true. If 
this is the case, the collectors may have to 
be shimmed to get them lined up properly. 
2. Now you must decide how you're going 
to Install the collector headers. Will they 
run above the roof, or will each panel be 
connected to an interior manifold running 
inside the attic under the roof sheathing? 
The first means few holes that have to be 
sealed and caulked. The second is easier 
to put together. The next few steps de-
scribe on-the-roof header construction in 
detail, but they also apply to collectors that 
are plumbed individually through the roof. 
45 

Figure 52 
3. Build the box that will house the top 
collector header, using a beveled 6 x 6 as 
shown in Figure 51. Screw it, along with 
the guide strip, to the roof with rustproof 
screws, making sure that both the box and 
the strip are perfectly horizontal. The 
plywood top of the box should be left off 
until the panels and headers are in place. 
4. Now add the left-side trim board as 
shown in Figure 52. This is just a 1 x 6 
angled at either end to match the bevel cut 
on the top and bottom pieces. 
5. A row of panels can now be laid in 
place. Start at the left side and work to the 
right, just laying the panels loosely on the 
roof. Next they should be butted against 
the guide strip, straightened and leveled 
(see Figure 53). A strip of wood can be 
tacked in place along the bottom of the 
panels to keep them from sliding down the 
roof. The individual boxes can be toe-nailed 
into the roof sheathing with 16-penny gal-
vanized nails, leaving 1/8 inch of space be-
tween collectors.

6. Next, the panels can be further fas-
tened in place using aluminum T-sections 
and long, gasketed lag screws. These will 
need to be at least 7 inches long. Run a 
double bead of phenoseal caulking down 
the edge of each collector box before the 
T-sections are screwed down. This caulk-
ing should seal the joints. 
7. Add the right-hand trim piece. 
8. Assemble the top header out of copper 
tubing. Solder all the joints carefully and 
test for leaks. All of this can be done on the 
ground. Connect the header to the panels 
on the roof with a union. See Figure 54. 
9. Screw the plywood top of the header 
box and finish the flashing as shown in 
Figure 54A. Stuff the box with fiberglass 
insulation before you close it. 
10. Build the bottom header box, fasten it 
to the roof horizontally, and build the Insu-
lated bottom header. Install them both, 
and stuff the box with fiberglass Insulation 
— once you've made sure the header itself 
is level and straight. See Figure 54B. 
11. Double check all lag screws and other 
fasteners to make sure the panels are held 
firmly in place. Caulk all joints thoroughly.

CHAPTER 5 
Building Solar 
Collectors 
If you can read a measuring tape, make a square 
saw cut, drive nails or screws, drill holes, and use 
a paint brush, you can build your own solar col-
lectors •— provided you buy the absorber plate 
itself. Making your own absorber gets fairly com-
plicated, and hardly seems worthwhile since 
there are several fine prefabricated plates on the 
market right now. Besides, you probably won't 
save much money building your own. 
Before you get started, there are four things to 
think about 
1. Select (or build) the collector plate carefully. 
It may be the most critical element in the whole 
system. 
2. Use galvanized nails and other waterproof 
fasteners in the collector box. Your panels will last 
many times longer if the hardware can't corrode. 
3. Learn to use a caulking gun if you don't al-
ready know how, and don't be afraid to use caulk-
ing liberally. Your collector will need to be 
waterproof. 
4. Use plenty of paint or wood preservative on 
the exterior wood parts of your collector. The 
longer you make them last, the longer your panel 
will survive. Well-treated wood should last a 
lifetime. But don't paint the inside of the collector 
box. Paint, creosote or Cuprinol will only vaporize 
in the intense heat and condense on the inside of 
the glazing. 
How Do You Judge the Worth 
of an Absorber Plate? 
Collector plates are usually made out of one of 
three materials: aluminum, copper, or steel. One 
of the ways to judge how well an absorber will 
perform is to examine the "thermal bond." Heat 
is transferred from the plate to the water by con-
duction. In other words, the best exchange is 
made because the two materials — fluid and 
metal — are in direct contact with each other. 
Heat can flow from a warm material to a cold 
material in any direction — up, down or sideways. 
In a collector other than a trickier it doesn't mat-
ter if the tubing in the absorber is above, below or 
within the collector plate itself. What does matter 
is that the tubing be bonded to the plate as 
closely as possible, so that direct contact is made 
along its entire length. To say it another way, a 
tube that's simply spot-soldered, tack-welded or 
wired to the collector plate will not have as good a 
thermal bond as a tube that's soldered all the way 
along. When it's soldered this way it's said to be 
"filleted." (See Figure 55.) Filleting is just one 
thing to look for. 
Another thing to examine is the material. 
Aluminum is cheaper than copper, but it doesn't 
conduct heat nearly so well. That is, copper 
doesn't need to absorb as much heat before it 
begins to transfer some of its warmth to the fluid 
in the channels. In areas where there is even a 
remote chance of freezing — practically every-
where in the continental United States — a mix-
ture of water and non-toxic antifreeze is normally 
run through the collector panels, as we'll see 
later. Most kinds of antifreeze react poorly with 
aluminum, causing the plate to corrode much 
more quickly than a copper one. Copper is 
corrosion-resistant. 
You also have to be a bit wary of steel. Hot 
water without anti-freeze corrodes steel very 
quickly, although chemicals in the antifreeze will 
allow the plate to last somewhat longer. Whatever 
the plate material is going to be, it should be the 
same as the tubing. They both must expand and 
49 

Figure 55. Solar radiation is changed to heat at the 
blackened absorber plate. The heat is then transferred 
to the fluid flowing inside the tubes. Here is where a 
good thermal bond is critical. Solder or welding 
should run along the entire length of the tubing so 
there's direct contact all the way. If not, heat will es-
cape. 
contract at the same rate, or the bond between 
them will be strained and eventually break. 
It's bad enough that steel can only be used in a 
"heat exchanger" system where there's an anti-
freeze solution. To make matters worse, you can't 
solder copper tubing to a steel collector plate be-
cause copper expands so much more than steel, 
and if you try to fasten galvanized pipe to a steel 
absorber plate by welding the two together, you 
won't get a good weld — even though you may 
get what welders call the "zinc shakes" from 
breathing the fumes while you try. 
Besides, most of the plumbing that transports 
the antifreeze mixture to and from the storage 
tank will probably be copper tubing, and connect-
ing galvanized pipe to copper pipe means you 
have to buy and install connector fittings. If the 
plate and tubing are already copper, you just 
need a simple soldered joint In short, a copper 
absorber plate is by far your best investment 
Some collector plates, like the one made by 
the Olin Company, are made with a "roll-bond" 
process. This procedure sneaks the liquid-carry-
ing channels right into the plate itself, making the 
absorber an even more efficient heat transmitter 
(iFigure 56, section "A"). At Olin, the tubing pat-
tern is laid out on one sheet of metal — in this 
case aluminum — and then a sandwich is made 
with a second sheet of aluminum. The two sheets 
are bonded together everywhere except where 
the channels are going to be. 
A special needle is stuck into the unbonded 
Figure 56. Keep referring to this sketch as you read 
Chapter 5. It shows several options for constructing a 
flat plate solar collector. 
Side A shows two layers of glass. Notice the spacing 
between them, and the spacing between the second 
layer and the absorber plate. The top cover rests on 
the top of the collector box. Its edge is held with an 
aluminum strip and sealed with caulking. The second 
layer of glass fits into a slot for support. In this case 
the absorber is a prefabricated plate manufactured 
with a "rollbond" process. Rigid duct insulation sup-
ports the absorber. 
The bottom of the box is plywood, and the sides are 
regular 2x6's. 
Side B shows an outer glazing of reinforced polyes-
ter and an inside glazing of Teflon plastic film. The film 
can be stapled to the inside of the support strip before 
the strip is nailed to the 2x6. Here the absorber is cop-
per with copper tubing. It sits on a 2-inch layer of duct 
insulation and a layer of Homesote — also a fine insu-
lation. 
50 

area and fluid is injected under tremendous pres-
sure. This great pressure forces the sheets apart 
where they're not stuck together, forming the 
tubes where liquid can flow. Other companies get 
similar results with other materials. 
Prefabricated absorber plates can run as high 
as $2.50 to $10.00 a square foot, and you have to 
shop cautiously because standards for commer-
cial manufacturers are not yet fixed. The best ab-
sorber plate we know of at this writing is the Ken-
necott Terralite copper absorber made in 
Lexington, Massachusetts (see appendix). 
Aside from being efficient, the Kennecott is 
cheaper than anything you could build from 
scratch. The plate itself, including the tubing, is 
very thin — about 1/4 inch — but totally ade-
quate. It withstands temperatures all the way from 
-30 degrees Fahrenheit to +300 degrees, and 
comes already precoated with flat black paint. 
What's most attractive about the Kennecott 
absorber is its price — $2 to $3.00 a Square foot, 
all plumbed and ready to go. At this rate a 3-foot 
by 8-foot plate will run about $60. Buying a pre-
made absorber at this price is by far the easiest 
and cheapest way to build a solar collector.

How Can You Build 
Your Own Absorber Plate? 
Some ambitious and highly-skilled types will 
surely choose to build their own absorbers. Sev-
eral good plans have been published lately, and 
even though they require a lot of picky labor, the 
final products work pretty well. 
One detailed set of instructions is put out by 
the Brace Research Institute near Montreal, the 
world-renowned center for studying intermediate 
technology. Their plans call for a sheet of gal-
vanized corrugated steel roofing riveted to a flat 
sheet that is slightly larger. The sides of the larger 
bottom sheet are crimped around the sides of the 
corrugated top sheet, and the ends are designed 
to accept short sections of galvanized pipe at 
either end. These pipes feed and drain the water

Figure 57. The drawing is taken from plans drawn up 
by the Brace Research Institute In Canada. The flat 
sheet Is riveted to the corrugated top sheet, and the 
rivets are then soldered to prevent leaks. The end cuts 
can be made quite accurately if you make a cardboard 
pattern and trace it onto the metal before you cut. The 
problem with this homemade absorber is that water 
doesn't always flow through it evenly. 
channels between the two metal surfaces (Fig-
ure 57). 
There are several other ways to build absorber 
plates with corrugated metal to make trickling 
collectors a la Thomason and Shore. Water can 
run either openly in the exposed corrugations or 
between the sheets (Figure 58). 
Both the Florida Energy Committee and the 
Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia 
have published excellent pamphlets on how to 
build solar collectors. The one from Florida is 
called How to Build a Solar Water Heater and 
costs $3.49. The Langley book, published by the 
G.S. Department of Commerce, is entitled An 
Inexpensive Solar Heating System for Homes. 
Its price is $4.25 (see bibliography). 
Each of these helpful booklets describes ways 
to bend 3/4-inch copper pipe into a series con-
51 

figuration across a copper sheet. The problem 
immediately apparent here is that bending pipe 
evenly for almost 180 degrees requires special 
skills and equipment And bonding it to the cop-
per sheet is a painstaking process that could only 
be done by someone with plenty of skill and ex-
perience. (It also looks like it would take miles of 
solder.) So it's not something we would recom-
mend to beginners, even though the directions 
are very complete. 
If you're a skilled plumber, and you do choose 
to make your own absorber plate using a series 
fluid-channel configuration, double the tubing 
back and forth across the plate leaving 4 to 6 
inches between the runs. The temptation wall be 
to space the channels closer than this to increase 
the distance fluid must travel through the panel. 
But studies show this only creates a bottleneck in 
the water flow. The absorber will not be more 
efficient with more closely spaced tubes. That 
only makes more friction in the pipes (Figure 59). 
If you decide to make an absorber plate with a 
parallel configuration of fluid channels, the spac-
ing between pipes still should be about 5 inches. 
The parallel riser tubes will want to be 3/8- to 
1/2-inch tubing, while the inlet and outlet man-
ifold pipes may have to be 3/4 inch in diameter 
to handle the load. (Risers in a thermosyphoning 
collector should be larger than 1/2 inch.) 
The advantage of parallel channels is that less 
friction is created in the collector. The problem is 
making leak-proof connections between the ris-
ers and the manifolds because they're of different 
sizes. This either means many expensive fittings if 
Figure 58. Do-it-yourself absorber plates are fre-
quently made of corrugated metal. As you can see, 
parallel water channels can be created in several dif-
ferent ways. 
Figure 59. If you plan to run a series of copper tubing 
across a copper plate to make your own absorber, 
you'll want to lay it out in a pattern something like this. 
The tubing should not double back on itself to be any 
closer than 6 inches. 
52 

you use copper, or some exact drilling and weld-
ing if you use steel or galvanized pipe. Dissimilar 
materials cannot be used. If you try, you'll only 
end up with "galvanic" corrosion at the joints. In 
any case, a parallel system of tubes should be 
assembled and thoroughly pressure tested be-
fore it's bonded to the plate itself. 
What About Painting 
the Absorber Plate? 
The absorber plate needs to be black to absorb 
much solar radiation, as you already know. There 
are special selective paints developed sp)ecifically 
for solar systems. These are expensive because 
they're so special, but they allow short wave radia-
tion to be absorbed by the plate, and at the same 
time retard reradiation of longer wave-length 
rays. Unfortunately some of these selective paints 
can't be easily applied at home, so we have to 
find substitutes. 
Shiny black paint, of course, reflects too many 
rays. And, some normal flat black enamels will 
not hold up well at the temperatures a solar col-
lector has to bear. They will crack, peel and chip, 
even if they're properly primed and applied to a 
clean, dry surface as the manufacturer recom-
mends. 
One alternative that's sometimes suggested is 
the anti-glare paint that's sprayed on aircraft 
right in front of the windshield. But this isn't the 
easiest thing in the world to find, naturally. Sears 
driveway coating, of all things, works pretty well if 
you use 2 coats and follow the application direc-
tions to the letter. 
Sherwin Williams, Rustoleum, and others 
make high-carbon, flat black paints that are more 
than satisfactory for absorber plate coatings. Two 
small cans will cover a 3-foot by 8-foot absorber 
plate easily. The very best paint — though it's 
somewhat expensive — is 3M Nextel Black Vel-
vet, which should be applied over Mextel gray 
primer. This is recommended above all others. 
Let's summarize what's been said so far: our 
best advice is to buy a precoated copper ab-
sorber plate and build your own collector box. 
How Do You Build 
the Collector Box? 
Anyone who can avoid hitting his thumb with a 
hammer can build a collector box. Usually it's 
nothing more than a simple frame made of 2 x 
6's. Doing it's like making a kid's sandbox, except 
that sometimes the wooden frame is covered 
with 1/8-inch aluminum angle pieces that are 
mitered at the corners. This isn't hard to do 
either. 
All you have to worry about is making the box 
as waterproof and dust-proof as you can. Any 
condensation that's allowed to build up on the 
glazing will cut down on the collector's efficiency. 
So will dust. If it collects on the collector plate it 
will absorb a lot of heat but have no way to con-
duct this heat to the liquid in the channels. So 
wetness and dust are the main reasons for using 
plenty of caulking and doing a careful job of 
flashing. 
It's best to use redwood, cedar or cypress 2 x 
6's, since spruce and pine will rot more quickly. It 
makes more sense, by the way, to use 2 x 6's 
than 2 x 4's because they are wide enough to 
allow at least an inch of space between the outer 
glazing and the absorber plate, plus room for in-
sulation beneath the plate. If the sides of the box 
are much higher than 6 inches, the absorber 
plate may be unnecessarily shaded when rays are 
hitting the box at a low angle (Figure 60). 
The bottom of the box can be 3/8-inch or 
1/2-inch plywood, and the plate itself can be 
supported by pieces of firring strip (often called 
striping), dowels, wires, or rigid insulation 
below the plate. The second layer of glazing (if 
you decide to use one) can either be fastened to 
a strip of wood at its edges or fit into slots that are 
rabbeted into the sides of the collector box. 
These slots should be cut with a table saw before 
the box is put together — if you hadn't already 
figured that out. And don't forget the holes for the 
inlet and outtake pipes. These should be as small 
as possible and sealed with caulking. 
The amount of airspace between the glazing 
and the absorber plate is not all that critical. One

show how everything in the collector panel might fit

an angle bracket and is caulked. Notice too how the 
fiberglass building insulation does not come in direct 
contact with the bottom of the absorber plate, but is 
protected by a layer of duct insulation. Resins in the 
fiberglass can vaporize in great heat and cloud the 
bottom of the glazing so less light can pass through. 
inch is just about right, even though experts find 
very little difference between 1/2 inch and 1 inch. 
This airspace does need to be sealed off as well 
as possible to keep dust from coming in and 
settling on the plate. So every joint should be 
caulked. And when you buy caulking, don't 
choose a cheap run-of-the-mill type. Silicone 
caulking is better than average; so is "pheno-
seal," an acrylic latex caulking; "Butylcaulk" is 
good, too. 
One of the things no one ever seems to men-
tion is venting for the collector box. This is im-
portant Make 3 or 4 small "weep" holes in the 
lower side of the box so the box can breathe. 
Those needn't be larger than 1/16 to 1/8 inch in 
diameter. If there's a slight airflow to and from 
the box and between the layers of glazing, there 
will be less chance of condensation on the cover 
plate. Incidentally, there's no point in trying to 
make the glazing seal perfectly airtight because 
the glazing material — whatever it is — will need 
to expand and contract a little, constantly break-
ing the seal (Figure 61). 
We already know that heat shouldn't be al-
lowed to escape through the bottom of the box. 
This is why there must be insulation beneath the 
absorber plate. Three to 4 inches is plenty. Don't 
use ordinary batts of home insulation alone. 
Regular fiberglass insulation has a resin "binder" 
which vaporizes if it's heated to around 300 de-
grees F. The vapors from this resin will waft up 
past the edges of the absorber plate and con-
dense on the underside of the glazing. There it 
will collect and look a little like maple syrup. This 
only blocks out light 
Put in a 1-inch layer of rigid fiberglass "duct" 
insulation — the kind without foil facing — im-
mediately below the absorber plate. This looks 
like yellow fiberboard, has no such resin binder, 
and can be bought at any plumbing and heating 
supply house. Then use insulation batts below it

waterproof and reasonably airtight.

the way — styrofoam or urethane — will soften, 
melt, shrink or disintegrate if it gets as hot as 200 
degrees F. Don't use it. 
One more thought while we're on the subject: 
Wood is fair insulation itself. If you choose to 
build the collector box of metal, make sure the 
edge of the absorber plate doesn't touch the 
metal sides of the box. If it does, lots of heat will 
be conducted through the sides of the box to the 
ambient air. This means that any metal box 
should be insulated along its sides as well as un-
derneath. 
How Should You 
Select Glazing? 
An absorber plate, no matter how good it is, can't 
make use of any radiation that doesn't get to it. 
So a glazing's ability to let light through is of 
number-one importance. To be really effective, a 
glazing material should be at least 88 to 92% 
translucent 
Most plastic glazings don't have the transmit¬ 
tance or heat-enduring properties of glass. In 
some cases, they get destroyed because ul-
traviolet rays break them down in a relatively 
short time. Others seem to hold up well enough, 
but certain ingredients in the plastic deflect rays 
sideways as they hit — rather than letting them 
straight through to the inside of the collector. 
Still, there are some notable exceptions, which 
make certain types of plastic even better than 
glass. Here are the four major types of glazing: 
atures" — a technician's way of saying that they'll 
bend and warp if they get too hot. Hard plastic is 
probably not a good bet for glazing in most cases 
(Figure 62). 
2. Films. This category includes polyethyl-
ene, Mylar, Tedlar, and clear Teflon — all thin 
plastics. Polyethylene, although it's easy to get 
and cheap, can't take a lot of heat either, and 
doesn't transmit light as well as some of the 
others. At best it will last a year, and most people 
find it unattractive on a "permanent" solar collec-
tor. 
Tedlar and Mylar are often mentioned in solar 
literature as fine glazing materials, but their worth 
is only marginal compared to glass and other 
things. They don't transmit all of the radiation 
they should to qualify as excellent solar glazing 
and they don't trap reradiated beams as well as 
glass. Mylar also degrades in the sun, though not 
nearly so fast as polyethylene. Tedlar has a life 
expectancy of about 6 years in most parts of the 
U.S., but it will gradually shrink in the heat, and 
shouldn't be stretched too tightly across the col-
lector box for just that reason. 
Teflon is excellent as an interior covering, but 
it only comes in a 1 -mil thickness, making it too 
thin for an exterior cover "plate." (Any film should 
be at least 4 mils thick to be useful as an outer 
glazing.) Teflon is every bit as expensive as glass, 
but it's easier to work with. And it's practically 
invisible, letting through 98% of the light that hits 
it. It comes in rolls, but it can't normally be found 
in the average hardware store. The best source 
for clear Teflon at the moment is the DuPont 
Company in Wilmington, Delaware (see appen-
dix). Order only as much as you need because 
it's quite expensive. 
1. Hard Plastics. These are a good deal 
lighter than glass, and are easier to cut and 
handle. You're probably familiar with plexiglass, 
the 
most commonly known of the hard, 
transparent plastics. There are also vinyls. These 
are inexpensive, but they can only be used as 
external cover plates — and only when there is a 
second layer of different glazing material (glass 
or Teflon) beneath them. This is because they 
have what's called low "deformation temper-
3. Glass. Glass comes in various strengths 
and grades. High-quality glass has a very low iron 
content, meaning that it reflects the least amount 
of light. Good glass should absorb only 3 to 4% of 
the radiation passing through it, whereas lower-
quality glass may absorb 6% or more. 
To judge the quality of a glass, look through it 
from its edge. The best glass will appear water 
clear or slightly bluish in hue. But poorer glass 
will have a greenish tinge. This may cost a good

Figure 62 (opposite). This exploded drawing is taken 
from plans for a solar collector prepared by Garden 
Way. The top Kalwall fiberglass glazing is held in place 
on the wooden frame by a box made of aluminum 
angle. Note how the glazing is supported every 3 feet 
by 2 strips of aluminum T-bar. These must be notched 
into the sides of the wooden box. The absorber is the 
Kennecott Terra-Light copper collector plate, and it's 
supported by thick duct insulation. Study the detail to 
see how a second layer of glazing can be added, mak-
ing the panel thicker. Detailed plans for complete 
solar hot water systems are available through Garden 
Way Publishing Company. 
deal less, but it won't transmit light as well and is 
less suitable. 
Most people choose to glaze solar collectors 
with single-strength glass, even though double-
strength may be better. "Tempered" glass is 
super, but it must be ordered to size and, has to 
be treated with kid gloves. If you chip an edge, a 
crack will develop in time. If you want to spend 
the money, you can even buy low-iron glass that 
is treated with an anti-reflective coating. AS.G. In-
dustries in Kingsport, Tennessee is a good 
source for special solar glazing (see appendix). 
4. Reinforced Polyesters. Most of us know 
these as fiberglass, even though the glass fibers 
are added mainly as strengtheners. Glassteel, a 
decent glazing, is a clear fiberglass laminated 
with Tedlar. Filon, manufactured in California, is 
that corrugated material you sometimes see serv-
ing as opaque skylight panels in barns, sheds and 
awnings. It transmits light exceptionally well, can 
be bought in flat rather than corrugated form, 
and is easy to find locally in many places. 
Reinforced polyesters are as good as glass in 
many ways — in some ways better. You can't see 
through them, but they have many of the same 
properties as glass. They're ideal for the do-it-
yourselfer because they don't crack or break 
under normal conditions, can be cut with a regu-
lar power saw, drilled, and even nailed. They also 
can't be shattered by hailstones or rocks. 
A fine "fiberglass" glazing is Kalwall Stun-lite 
Regular or Sun-lite Premium, made in Man-
chester, New Hampshire (see appendix). It's 88 to 
92% transparent to solar radiation and is recom-
mended in areas where winter temperatures av-
erage 30 degrees F. or below. Two layers of Kal-
wall can be used, but normally it's limited to the 
outer glazing where there's a film such as Teflon 
underneath. (The Kalwall company by the way, 
has excellent customer service.) 
In fact, all of the last 3 types of material can be 
used in various combinations if you choose to 
use a double glazing. You'd find very little differ-
ence in efficiency between them, but the very 
best combination would be a layer of low-iron 
glass above a layer of clear Teflon. Least efficient 
would be 2 layers of reinforced polyester. Some-
where in between would be a layer of fiberglass 
with a layer of Teflon, or 2 layers of glass. Take 
your choice. To be honest, all of these combina-
tions are actually very close in efficiency, and all 
should work out fine. 
How Should You Glaze 
Your Collector? 
One layer of glazing or two? That's the great de-
bate. There are plenty of arguments either way, 
and plenty of graphs to "prove" that one choice is 
better than the other. Most of these conflicting 
studies take all the factors — solar angle, climate, 
orientation, tilt, latitude and ambient temperature 
— into account. One thing, though, is pretty 
clear: If the temperature where you live is likely to 
fall below 0 degrees Fahrenheit at any time dur-
ing the year, you'd better use a double glazing. 
The second pane will surely help reduce heat 
losses to passing winter winds. 
It would seem that if two layers are better than 
one, 3 layers would be better still. Wrong. One 
layer of good glazing transmits about 92% of the 
radiation that hits it to the collector plate, but 2 
layers only lets through about 80%. After that, the 
law of diminishing returns takes over again. Each 
layer of glass or plastic absorbs some heat, 
shades the collector some, and reflects some 
radiation back to the atmosphere. A double glaz-
ing, with an air sandwich between the layers, acts 
like a thermalpane window to hold in heat and 
keep cold out. But 3 layers, in spite of what some 
claim, is likely to be less efficient than 2 — by a 
57 

lot. This is mainly because of the large reflection 
and absorption losses. 
The primary reason for glazing, remember, is 
to prevent loss of heat energy through convec-
tion. Air movement pulls heat away from the col-
lector plate in this case. The more airtight you 
can make the panel by sealing around the glass 
shield, the less air circulation there will be inside. 
But sealing and supporting the glazing are the 
most difficult problems. 
The external layer is usually a rigid material — 
either glass or reinforced polyester. This can 
simply be laid on top of the 2 x 6 collector box. It 
should be fastened with some sort of gasket ar-
rangement or caulked with an elastic caulking to 
prevent leaking and still allow for expansion (Fig-
ure 63). Caulking is easy enough to apply. It 
comes in a tube that fits into a caulking gun. With 
a little practice you can learn to squeeze the trig-
ger of the gun to run a nice even "bead" of seal-
ant to any surface the edge of the glass will be 
resting against 
Unfortunately, you can't have a long expanse 
of unsupported glass. Glass cracks or shatters 
under a lot of stress, but it's actually a very elastic 
material that will sag under its own weight if it's 
too long or too wide. In other words, don't try to 
cover a large collector with a single sheet of 
glass. 
The maximum size you can use is about 24 
inches by 72 inches, and that's pushing things. 
Aluminum " H " moldings offer one of the best 
Figure 63. Glass that has been gasketed with neoprene 
can be supported and joined with this kind of arrangement 
using aluminum angle. This way the glass will be slightly 
recessed in the collector box. 
Figure 64. Extruded aluminum "H" molding offers a 
simple way to join glass edge to edge. A bead of 
phenoseal caulking run In the molding channel will 
make a fairly good seal. Don't forget to allow room for 
the glass to expand. 
Notches for Tubing 
Figure 65. When there are several collectors to be 
mounted together, make a single framework divided 
into separate bays for the individual absorbers. The 
dividers will have to be drilled or notched for the tub-
ing that connects the panels. 
58 

ways to join panes of glass edge to edge (Figure 
64). If you're going to have many solar collectors 
together, it might be wise to build one large col-
lector box with dividers to house the individual 
absorber plates. This way you can glaze with 
larger sheets of fiberglass and shiplap your joints, 
sealing them with caulking (Figure 65). 
The inner layer of glazing can be either glass or 
plastic film. The film should be stretched be-
tween the sides of the collector box, pulled over a 
strip of wood and stapled before the wooden strip 
is nailed to the inner side of the box. If the inner 
layer is glass, the edge of the glazing might rest 
on wooden support strips, or be recessed into the 
sides of the box. The bite of the slot should be as 
deep as it can be, to support the glass as well as 
possible and still allow for expansion. Don't forget 
the inner glass will expand more than the outer 
layer because it's hotter in there. 
What About Spacing? 
There should be about 1/2 inch of space be-
tween layers of glazing and at least 3/4 of an inch 
to 1 inch of space between the inner glazing and 
the absorber plate. 
If you do choose glass as your outer collector 
covering, install it last — after the rest of the col-
lector assembly has been fastened to the roof 
and all the plumbing is in place. Then get some 
of those suction cup devices with handles on 
them that glass companies use when they carry 
p)late glass windows. Using them is the best way 
to lift glass onto a roof. They not only make the 
glass easier and safer to handle, they keep it from 
getting smudged with fingerprints. Obviously you 
want the glass to be as clean as possible once 
you get it on. And try not to let any foreign mate-
rial into the collector box while you're working. 
Once the glass is in place, you should have noth-
ing to worry about except covering the collectors 
until the rest of the plumbing is finished. 
When the whole system is in operation, you 
might want to go up on the roof once a year or so 
to admire your handywork. While you're there, 
squeegee off the glass to remove any oils that 
might have collected out of the polluted air. Dust 
may gather on the outer glass from time to time, 
too, but it won't slow the collector down notice-
ably. Rain will take care of it eventually, anyway.

CHAPTER 6 
Storing 
and Protecting 
Your Solar Energy 
We know how to collect energy from the sun. Our 
problem now is to store it effectively. Solar 
energy, as everyone knows, is not constant. We 
have seasonal changes and clouds, which nat-
urally affect the sun's intensity, and we also have 
night. One reason why heating domestic hot 
water with the sun makes so much sense is be-
cause water itself is such an excellent storage 
medium. In fact, if you're going to transport or 
store solar energy, using water — or at least a 
fluid containing water — is one of the best ways 
to do it. 
Earth, rocks and concrete are also fine storage 
mediums. But they're not as good as water — 
nor nearly so versatile. You see, every substance, 
whether it's a solid, liquid or gas, has a charac-
teristic called its specific heat. Its specific heat is 
the number of BTU's needed to change the tem-
perature of that substance 1 degree Fahrenheit. 
Water has a specific heat of "1," meaning that 
it takes 1 BTU to raise the temperature of 1 
pound of water 1 degree F. The specific heats of 
all other substances are measured against water. 
In fact, the whole concept of the British Thermal 
Unit (BUG) is based on the idea that water is the 
standard against which other things can be com-
pared. 
Water has a very stable disposition as far as 
temperature change is concerned. You can feel 
this if you wrap your hand around a glass of ice 
water or a cup of hot coffee. The warmth in your 
hand does very little to heat the cold water in the 
glass, and there is no way you could significantly 
reduce the temperature of the coffee — at, say, 
180 degrees — to 98.6 (your temperature) just 
by keeping your hand around the cup. Water is 
so common we take it for granted, but it's 
unique stuff because it is so stable. 
A non-toxic antifreeze like propylene glycol — 
which we'll need to discuss soon — has a specific 
heat of 0.6 BTU's per pound. Rocks, iron, con-
crete and many other solids need only about 0.2 
BTU's to raise their temperature 1 degree. So 
their specific heats are 0.2. It takes more BTU's to 
heat water (1.0 as compared to 0.2), but by the 
same token it takes more to cool it off (also 1). 
This is just another way of saying that more heat 
can be stored in a substance with a high specific 
heat than can be stored in one with a low specific 
heat. 
Even in this modem day and age, with all our 
technology, an insulated tank full of hot water is 
still one of the best ways to preserve many BTU's 
of energy. A single cubic foot of water can store 
62.5 BTU's of heat per degree Fahrenheit. Stone, 
by comparison, has a heat-holding capacity of 36 
BTU's per cubic foot per degree F. — a little over 
half that of water. But air — sometimes used as a 
medium to transfer solar energy — only holds 
0.018 BTU's per degree F. per cubic foot! 
What Should Your Storage Tank 
Do Besides Store Heat? 
Let's discuss some terms you'll want to be famil-
iar with as you design your solar heater: 
People who work with solar heating say that a 
system is down whenever the sun is not shining 
and all the stored solar energy has been used up. 
In other words, "down" means the system is just 
not producing. The down point is reached when 
hot water can't be taken from the storage tank 
any longer — because it's not hot enough. At this 
point we either go without a hot shower or have a 
set-up that allows a fuel-fired or electrical back-up 
system to kick in. 
Thermal lag describes the amount of time it 
takes to collect enough heat — once the sun is 
60 

shining again — to get water in the storage unit 
above the down point. (The "lag time" is how 
long it takes to make the system productive 
again.) The term carry-through, describes the 
amount of time without sunshine that a solar 
heating system can continue to function without 
help from any other heat source. A system with a 
long carry-through is probably very well insulated 
with an oversize storage capacity, as well as hav-
ing efficient collectors to feed the storage. Obvi-
ously we want any system to operate above its 
down point as much of the time as possible, as 
well as to have a brief thermal lag. 
You'll need a larger storage tank for a solar 
water heater than you probably now have for your 
conventional set up. It's smart to assume there 
will be fairly long periods when there's little or no 
solar energy coming in. The larger the tank, the 
less likely you're going to run out of solar hot 
water. 
Allow enough storage capacity to keep each 
member of the household in hot water for at least 
2 sunless days. (That sounds like a lot, but it's 
only 40 gallons a person, if you figure 20 gallons 
per person per day.) Two people can get away 
with an 80 gallon tank. But any more than 2 will 
need a 120 gallon tank. If you can afford it and 
have the space, always buy a larger tank than you 
think you'll need. 
If you live in a northern climate, be realistic. 
Think of your solar water heating system as a 
"preheater" for your regular hot water system, 
even though you'll be trying to provide enough 
hot water from the sun to keep the electric, oil or 
gas hot water heater from working most of the 
time. The two systems, old and new, should be 
connected — or "in line" as they say. As the 
solar-heated water leaves its own storage tank, it 
should pass through the conventional water 
heater, but be so hot that the thermostat in the 
heater registers no need for the heat to come on. 
But face it. There will be times when your back-
up system must come on, even if you have a 
huge storage capacity (Figure 66). 
It would be a mistake to buy a very large stor-
age tank with an electrical heating unit — called a 
"booster" — right in it. Because electricity will 
heat water so much faster than it can be heated 
in the solar panels, the electrical element will 
keep coming on before the collectors have had a 
Figure 66. Think of your solar water heater as a pre-
heater for your existing hot water system. The two sys-
tems should be connected in a series so that hot water 
flows through both tanks on its way to the house. 
Don't forget that the existing hot water tank will also 
store solar hot water. This is why it too should be insu-
lated every bit as well as the primary storage tank. 
Water in both tanks will be circulating much of the 
time. As the hottest water comes in contact with the 
walls of the tank, some of its heat can be radiated to 
the outside air. This is why there must be Insulation all 
around the tanks. 
chance to restore enough heat to the tank. In 
other words, the electric heater will interfere with 
the solar system, and throw into a tizzy any ther-
mostatic controls you may have. It's far better to 
have two tanks: one exclusively for the solar sys-
tem, and one for the back-up system, even 
though heated water will pass through both. 
It's quite possible that your system could be 
"down" if you washed a lot of lunch dishes and 
then a couple of your house guests decided to 
take long showers. The thermal lag — or recov-
ery time — would then depend on the capacity of 
your collectors. On a good bright day it's reason-
able to expect that the collectors can restore hot 
water in the tank at a rate of 1 gallon per square 
foot of collector surface per hour under ideal 
noontime conditions. So if you had two 24 
square foot collectors, you might anticipate up to 
48 gallons of new hot water in an hour's time. 
Warning: Water in solar storage can get too 
hot if it's sunny and you don't draw any water 
from the tank for several hours. Kids can scald

Float Type Air Vent

Figure 67. Here is a schematic diagram of a simple 
solar shower for a cabin or summer camp. No anti-
freeze is used, and there's no pump. Because this is a 
thermosyphoning system (see Chapter 8), the bottom 
of the storage tank — in this case an insulated 55-
gallon oil drum — must be at least a foot higher than 
the top of the solar collector. There must be a drain 
valve at the lowest point in the system so the plumbing 
can be emptied completely when it's not in use. 
Notice, too, that the vent pipe must be placed at the 
highest point in the system. If it's not, water will flow 
out of it. 
their hands if there's no water temperature reg-
ulator. Teach them to mix water at the tap when 
they wash. Turn on the cold first, and then the 
hot — gradually (Figure 67). 
How Should You 
Select a Tank? 
Spend some time shopping for your storage 
tank. They vary a lot in price, quality, and in the 
amount of insulation they have. Used tanks of 
various kinds may offer some attractive pos-
sibilities. Look for old water tanks or larger pro-
pane tanks if you can only spend a little money. 
The tank will need to stand a lot of pressure — 
as much as 60 pounds per square inch (psi). 
Sixty psi is normal in many homes and municipal 
systems. So check the tank's structure pretty 
thoroughly, particularly joints or welds you make 
yourself. 
The outside surface area of the tank is some-
thing to consider too. A spherical tank would be 
ideal because it has the least amount of surface, 
but nobody makes them so far as we know. A 
short squat cylinder has less surface area than a 
tall, skinny one. Ideally you should get the diame-
ter of the tank as close to the height as possible. 
In the case of hot water storage, convection 
becomes your worst enemy. It's a real heat thief. 
Because the hottest water in the tank always 
wants to rise, and the coldest water in the tank 
wants to settle to the bottom, the contents of the 
tank keep circulating as new water of differing 
temperatures passes in and out. As the water cir-
culates, the hottest water is continually exposed 
to the outside of the tank where its heat can be 
lost to the outside air (See Figure 66). If there's 
less surface area, of course, less water is exposed 
to the sides of the tank. 
Heat has a natural tendency to radiate from a 
hot place to a cold place. As a matter of fact, this 
is one of heat's major characteristics, regardless 
of where it's found. It will always travel from an 
area with the highest temperature to an area with 
the lowest temperature. And heat loss is "om-
nidirectional," meaning that it will escape in any 
direction it can. 
Stable as water is, heat wants to drift away from 
it, too. The purpose of wrapping extra insulation 
around the outside of a hot water tank, of course, 
is to block the heat's path of escape. It's also 
important to know that some radiated heat can 
be reflected back: at its source by using foil-faced 
insulation (as long as the foil faces in — toward 
the tank). 
If you live in a temperate climate where the 
temperature may fall below freezing during part 
of the year, you must circulate a mixture of water 
and non-toxic antifreeze through your collectors 
so the panels can never freeze. This mixture has 
to be kept separate from your regular water sup-
ply, naturally. 
This means that your system will have a loop of 
plumbing to run antifreeze fluid through the col-
62 

Figure 68. In climates where there is even a remote 
chance of freezing, or wherever there's very hard 
water, which can leave mineral deposits in the system, 
a fluid containing antifreeze and water must be circu-
lated through the solar collectors. Heat is given off 
from the collector loop through a coil of tubing called 
a heat exchanger. Although the heat exchanger may 
be right inside the solar storage tank, the two fluids 
never actually come in contact with each other. 
lectors, and a second layout of plumbing to run 
pure water from the supply line to the storage 
tank, through the back-up system and to the 
house itself. The first loop is usually called the 
collector loop; the second is called the hot water 
loop. Heat must be passed from one loop to the 
other at what's called a heat exchanger — a coil 
of tubing that's usually within the storage tank 
itself (Figure 68). 
Heat exchangers will be explained in detail later 
on, but for now let's just say that a large storage 
tank with a heat exchanger coil — or a second 
heat exchanging tank inside the larger outer one 
— are fairly easy items to find these days (see 
appendix). It's probably not a good idea, by the 
way, to buy an old tank and try to build in a heat 
exchanger coil yourself. Nearly always this turns 
out to be more expensive than buying a new one. 
Look for a tank-heat exchanger combination 
that's stone lined. The stone inhibits corrosion of 
the metal tank walls, even though it won't neces-
sarily help the tank hold heat more efficiently. A 
good one should last many years, and some even 
have a 10-year warranty. Glass-lined tanks, inci-
dentally, don't last as long as they should for this 
kind of a system (Figure 69). 
Cold Water from Source 
Figure 69. Heat exchangers can be located in chim-
neys, fireplaces and woodstoves so that water passing 
through them can pick up additional free heat. In this 
case, a coil is placed in the floor of the shower. The 
solar heated water from the shower head does double 
duty. It not only warms and washes the person in the 
shower, it contributes some of its heat to the cold 
water on its way to the storage tank. 
63 

Ford Products of Valley Cottage, New York 
(see appendix) makes fine stone-lined heat ex-
changer tanks that are guaranteed for 5 years 
and should last for 20. Their 120-gallon tank 
(Model TC-120) is just about ideal for a family of 
3 or more — in both price and storage capacity. 
Your solar water tank should be insulated as 
perfectly as possible. But don't forget that the 
conventional water heater is also holding hot 
water. It may be open to tremendous heat loss. 
Don't assume that your "insulated" electric water 
heater, for example, is insulated enough. It prob-
ably has only 1-1/2 inches of fiberglass insula-
tion. You will be wise to give it another 3-1/2 inch 
wrapping of foil-faced or kraft-faced insulation 
held in place with duct tape and staples. 
How Should You Install 
the Storage Tank? 
Water tanks are heavy. The water alone in a 
120-gallon tank weighs about half a ton. (A cubic 
foot of water weighs 62.5 pounds, and there are 
just a touch over 7.5 gallons to the cubic foot.) 
Naturally it would be dangerous to put a large 
tank in an attic or on some wooden floor that 
might not support it. This is why most solar stor-
age tanks wind up either in a basement or in a 
heated garage sitting on a concrete slab, 
Ideally the tank should be situated slightly away 
from walls and comers, so you can walk all the 
way around it. This will make repairs and installa-
tion of the rest of the system a whole lot simpler. 
If you don't have enough room to do this, plan 
things so that important valves, switches, gauges 
or connections are out front and easy to get at. 
At some point — we hope in the far-distant 
future — the storage tank is going to corrode 
through somewhere and spring an irreparable 
leak. (They all do sooner or later.) Don't forget to 
plan an escape route for the dead tank. It would 
be embarrassing to have to jackhammer out a 
basement wall just to get it out and get a new 
tank in. 
How Should You Insulate 
Your Storage Tank? 
Keeping heat in a hot water storage tank is like 
trying to keep a leaky inner tube pumped up. No 
matter how hard you try, you're constantly fight-
ing a losing battle. Some heat will always escape. 
How much insulation is enough? It's theoreti-
cally impossible to over-insulate a solar hot water 
system, but here are some minimums: There 
should be at least 3-1/2 inches of fiberglass insu-
lation — or its equivalent — behind the absorber 
plate in the solar collector, as we already know. 
There should be at least 1-1/2 inches of insula-
tion on all pipes in the system, and there should 
be at least 6 inches of insulation around the stor-
age tank. 
If you can afford to do more than this, so much 
the better. Protecting your solar-heated water 
with more-than-adequate insulation (that has 
been carefully installed) will reward you directly 
because your back-up system will come into play 
far less often. You should also have a basic un-
derstanding of how much heat leaks through 
various types of insulation. Here's how those 
things are computed: 
Every material has a measurable "C" value and 
an "R" value. The "C" value describes the con-
ductivity of an insulation. It tells us how many 
BTU's of heat will pass through a square foot of 
the material in an hour's time when the temper-
ature on one side of the material is 1 degree F. 
colder than on the other. You have no convenient 
way to measure C value, and you won't know 
what it is because it's rarely printed on the label of 
insulation packaging. 
But the "R" value — which will appear on the 
package — is something you can know about. 
The R value is dependent on the C value. R tells 
you the resistance of the insulating material to 
heat passing through it. In mathematical terms, R 
is the reciprocal of C. In other words, 
C = 1/R 
64 

For example, if you read that the R value of a 
particular insulation is 20, that means that l/20th 
(0.05) of a BTU of heat will pass through 1 
square foot of the material in 1 hour if the tem-
perature differential is 1 degree Fahrenheit. If the 
package says R-11, that means that 1/11th 
(0.09) of a BTU will pass through in the same 
amount of time, and so on. 
To put it another way, the greater the R value, 
the greater resistance the material has to the pas-
sage of heat. So an insulation layer with a high 
number — 20 for instance — is better protection 
than one with a low number like 4. Unfortunately, 
doubling or tripling the thickness at a material 
doesn't necessarily produce twice or three times 
the R factor. 
R value usually accounts for an inch thickness 
of whatever material we're talking about. One 
inch of fiberglass building insulation has an R 
value of 4. But 3-1/2 inches of the same material 
has a value of only R-11. Six inches jumps to 
R-19, and 12 inches all the way to R-38. 
Styrofoam is rated at R-4.2 per inch — a little 
better than fiberglass. But urethane foam is better 
— R-6.3 per inch. Wood (pine specifically) has an 
R value of only 1.2, but concrete, metal and stone 
are much worse insulators — R-0.08 (Figure 70). 
There's a third value to keep in the back of 
your mind. The "G" value is the total of all the 
heat resistances of all the materials surrounding 
the hot water — or any other heat source that's 
being insulated, for that matter. This includes the 
tank's metal sides, the insulation and the airspace 
if there is any. Again, G is a reciprocal of all the 
R's, 
U = 1/R 
Say the total R factor for one square foot of 
insulated tank comes to 20.2 (including the 
metal, airspace, 6 inches of fiberglass and some 
wood). The G value will be 1/20.2 or 0.049. (This 
means, to say it one more time, that 0.049 BTU's 
per square foot can escape from the tank when 
the temperature differential is 1 degree F.) 
If the water in the tank is 140 degrees and the 
temperature in your basement is, say, 60 de-
grees, the temperature differential is 80 degrees 
(140 - 60 = 80). Multiplying the G value times 
Total BTU's Lost (U X Sq. Ft. of Tank) 
Figure 70. Heat loss from a storage tank is continu-
ous, and it can happen in any direction. To insulate a 
tank as effectively as possible it's good to be familiar 
with the conductivity (C value) and the resistance (R 
value) of the various materials surrounding the water. 
To calculate total heat loss, you should also know the 
U value, which is the total of all the resistance in the 
insulating materials. 
the temperature difference (0.049 x 80) we get a 
heat loss per square foot of 3.9 BTU's per hour. 
If the total square footage of a 120-gallon hot 
water tank is around 50 square feet, then the total 
heat loss from the tank is 50 times 3.9 BTU's or 
195 BTU's per hour. This is a very round-about 
way of saying what was said originally, that no 
matter how well you insulate your tank, there is 
still going to be a certain amount of stored solar 
energy lost. 
Because heat tends to rise, insulation does the 
most good above the heat source. Any extra ma-
terial should be put at the top of the tank. Another 
way to insulate a tank very well is to build a 
65

plywood box around the tank and fill it with 
styrofoam beads (R-3.6 per inch) or the kind of 
cellulose insulation that gets blown into the walls 
of old houses. Blown cellulose has an R value of 
3.7 (Figure 71). 
Foamed-in-place insulation (R-5.2 per inch) is 
better still. It fills all the nooks and crannies 
around the tank, and it's just a matter of mixing 
two liquids together and pouring them into the 
box. The mixture will expand, foam and bubble 
like a witch's brew, and work its way into all the 
spaces between the tank and the plywood. A 
good source for this stuff is your local insulation 
contractor. 
These last two methods although they're quite 
good, have certain disadvantages too — not the 
least of which is that the tank is awfully hard to 
get at once the insulation is in place, in any case, 
take some of these thoughts and wage your own 
war with heat loss as best you can.

water tank is to build a plywood insulation bin around 
it. This can be filled with styrofoam beads, sheets of

What Types of Plumbing 
Should You Use? 
CHAPTER 7 
Building the 
Transfer System 
The energy transfer system in a solar water heat-
er is nothing more than good old fashioned 
plumbing. We move heat energy from the source 
(the absorber plate in the collector) to the storage 
area (the hot water tank) through pipes. This 
transfer system may be regulated in some cases 
by a control system, which usually takes the form 
of a pump, some valves and a differential ther-
mostat, but this is not nearly so complicated as it 
sounds. (All of these last things will be discussed 
in Chapter 9.) 
There is nothing fancy or exotic about the 
plumbing layout. If you've had any experience at 
all with measuring, cutting pipe, and soldering 
joints, you should be able to do all or most of the 
work yourself. 
Needless to say, you should plan as much as 
you can in advance. Remember the advice of the 
Wright Brothers, who said in effect, "If you get it 
right on paper before you start, it'll be right when 
it's built" 
If you're totally inexperienced, you can always 
consult a licensed plumber whenever your confi-
dence falters. For most plumbers, solar water 
heating is still something of a novelty. If you call 
one you know, he may be interested to learn 
about what you're doing. Who knows, you may 
even get some free advice — as we have from 
time to time. 
You may be very tempted to use plastic tubing 
because it produces very little in-line friction and 
because it's so easy to cut and install (also be-
cause some other sources will recommend that 
you use polyvinyl chloride — PVC — or chlori-
nated polyvinyl chloride plumbing that you can 
glue together). Don't. 
Plastic plumbing can't stand the heat in a 
high-performance solar water heater (although 
we do recommend plastic tubing for a solar sys-
tem to heat swimming p)Ool water — see Chapter 
10). Most of the joints and fittings will be fine until 
one blistering hot day when there's lots of sun. 
When the water temperature gets very high — 
.say 200 degrees — something will give out, and 
suddenly you'll have a serious leak and a major 
repair job. Sometime soon there will be plastic 
plumbing systems that can withstand these tem-
peratures, but they're not here yet. Stick with 
copper for now. 
Copper tubing comes in two basic forms. 
Normal household plumbing is usually made up 
of the first — rigid copper tube. You might want 
to use this if you're putting a solar hot water sys-
tem in a new house. It's straight, easy to work with 
and more attractive than the second type — if it's 
exposed to view. Rigid copper tubing is normally 
sold in 10- or 20-foot lengths. 
Soft: copper tubing is sold in coils, 15,30 or 60 
feet long. Use this if you're planning to retrofit an 
old house. It's much easier to thread through old 
walls and other tight places because it's flexible. 
And because it comes in such long pieces, you 
don't have to worry about making a joint in some 
hard-to-get-at spot. 
It's a good idea to be sure of the grade of 
tubing you're buying. The outside diameter 
(O.D.) is always 1/8 inch larger than the stated 
diameter. That is, 1-inch pipe is actually 1-1/8 
67 

inches in O.D. But the inside diameter varies, 
depending on the grade (Table 10). 
Type K has the thickest wall. It may last longer, 
but it will transport less fluid because the inside is 
smaller. The price is also exorbitant. Type L has 
medium thickness. Type M has the thinnest tube 
wall, but it's very difficult to find in soft copper 
rolls. In a simple solar water heater with natural 
water circulation, soft Type L tubing is usually 
recommended because of the corrosion factor 
with plain water. But if you're planning a forced 
circulation system, rigid Type M, the lower grade 
tubing, should be perfectly adequate because 
you'll be using a low corrosion heat transfer fluid 
— the antifreeze solution. 
The flow rate of liquid through a pipe is ex-
pressed in gallons per minute (gpm). Flow rate, 
of course, is reduced when there's lots of friction 
within the tube. (Plumbers use other terms to 
describe friction, by the way. They call it "pres-
sure drop" or "head loss.") 
Normal home plumbing rarely uses tubing 
that's less than 3/4 inch. That should be just 
about right for most forced circulation solar water 
heaters — although for a very long run or for a 
Courtesy George Daniels, Home Guide to Plumbing, Heating 
and Air Conditioning. 
Table 10. This table presents the actual dimensions of 
Type L — medium weight — copper tubing. Notice 
that the outside diameter is always Vs inch (0.125) 
larger than the stated diameter. This is often a source 
of confusion. 
thermosyphoning system (see chapter 8) 1 -inch 
pipe would be better. (Pressure drop in 100 feet 
of 3/4-inch copper pipe at a flow rate of 12 gal-
lons per minute is 15 pounds per square inch. 
But in a 1-inch pipe, equally long, with water flow-
ing through in at the same rate, the pressure drop 
is only 4.25 psi.) For a set up with a very large 
capacity you may want 1-1/2- or even 2-inch 
mains. 
Another important lesson in the general-
plumbing-information category: A lower flow rate 
reduces friction and thereby reduces pressure 
loss. So you'll want to find a happy medium. A 
typical flow rate through a solar water heating 
system is at the most 5 gallons per minute — 
relatively slow. If it's faster than one gallon per 
minute per collector, you're endangering the col-
lector by exposing the fluid channels to some-
thing called "erosion corrosion." By the same to-
ken, each collector should have a minimum, flow 
rate of 1/2 gallon per minute. 
How Should You Lay Out 
Your Plumbing? 
Again, sketch everything on paper before you 
make a move, reminding yourself that the run of 
plumbing between the collectors and the tank 
should be as short as possible. There are three 
very good reasons for this: (1) you want to elimi-
nate as much heat loss as you can, (2) you want 
to reduce friction in the pipes, and (3) you want to 
save the cost of tubing. 
The shortest distance between two points, as 
always, is a straight line. This goes for plumbing 
too. Try to use as few elbows and 45-degree an-
gles as you can. Friction in the pipes (head loss) 
will always be less if you make gradual direction 
changes instead of sharp ones (Figure 72). 
And, don't forget this basic rule of plumbing 
too: Put a boiler drain at the very lowest point in 
the system. Make everything flow downhill toward 
it, and don't leave any places where the tubing is 
level enough to "hide" water after the system has

been emptied. Standing water can freeze, burst a 
pipe or blow a joint apart. 
By the same token, it's important not to have 
level spots or sags in the lines where air bubbles 
can be trapped. When a tube gets "air locked" in 
this way, the water flow is slowed down or, in 
some cases, stopped altogether. If this happens 
in or near a collector, you can expect serious 
damage from overheating. 
The very highest point in the system — some-
where in the out-flow header above the topmost 
collector — should have a float-type air vent. This 
will allow air bubbles to escape and prevent water 
from being syphoned out of the collector too 
rapidly. It also allows air to come into the system 
when you're draining it. With no vent it would be 
like trying to let lemonade out of a drinking straw 
when you're holding your finger over the top. 
Liquid won't flow downward in a tube unless air 
can enter at the top. 
Your plumbing system also may need some 
sort of pressure relief. There will be times when 
you won't use hot water on a sunny day, and the 
fluid circulation will be very slow as a result. At 
times like this the fluid in the collector loop will 
expand, building up enough pressure to destroy 
a collector or some other part of the system. An 
expansion tank tapped into one of the lines will 
take up this overflow. In fact, the expansion tank's 
function is to keep consistent pressure in the sys-
tem at all times — normally about 15 psi. 
Don't forget that domestic hot water lines and 
collector-loop lines, which contain non-toxic an-
tifreeze, must be kept totally separate. As you 
make connections close to the water tank, the 
two lines may be near each other. You might 
want to color-code each circuit so there is no 
possibility of confusion at some later date. 
Working in an old house presents a problem 
for any new plumbing. Rather than try to run your 
tubing through existing walls, why not make hol-
low "posts" of 1 X 6 or 1 X 8 pine, which stand 
against a wall. These don't look bad if they're 
done well. They can be stuffed with fiberglass 
insulation and painted or papered to match the 
wall behind (Figure 73). 
Figure 73. There's no reason for solar plumbing to be 
exposed, even in an old house that's being retrofitted. 
Soft copper tubing can sometimes be threaded 
through existing walls. But where it can't be, make 
hollow wooden "posts" to disguise the pipes. These 
should be stuffed with insulation to prevent heat loss. 
It's a good idea generally, to run the feeder line to the 
collectors and the return line close together. It saves 
work in the long run. 
69 

And while we're on the subject of insulation, we 
should emphasize that every inch of plumbing, if 
possible, should be protected against heat loss. 
One of the easiest — and most efficient — ways 
to do this is to run your feeder line and your 
return line parallel and close together — about 2 
inches apart. Then wrap some ordinary fiberglass 
insulation around both pipes and staple it to itself. 
A more expensive but more pleasant-looking 
alternative would be to buy flexible foam pipe 
insulation. Vascocel is an excellent product 
which you can buy at almost any air conditioning 
or refrigeration outlet. Arma-Flex is another very 
good name (see appendix). 
Ready-made pipe insulation like this usually 
comes in 4-foot lengths and is slit end to end. 
You pull the insulation apart with your fingers, slip 
it over the pipe and stick it back together by 
wrapping it with waterproof tape. It's made to fit 
standard copper tubing exactly, so make sure 
you get the right size. 
Finally, whenever piping must pass through 
the roof or exterior walls, make "X" slits in the 
insulation instead of holes, push the pipe 
through, and then gently stuff the insulation back 
around the pipe. This should give you the least 
amount of heat loss at that point. 
How Do You Put 
the Plumbing Together? 
Connections between pieces of copper tubing 
are made with special fittings and solder, as 
everyone knows. Plumbers, fix-it men and do-it-
yourselfers call it "sweating" joints. Copper pipe, 
of course, is soft and easy to cut. You can use 
either a hacksaw or a small tube cutter which 
leaves you with a perfectly square end. 
To sweat a joint you'll need four things: (1) 
some steel wool or emery paper, (2) flux, which is 
a paste that looks like Vaseline, (3) solder wire, 
and (4) a heat source — usually a propane torch. 
These things can be found at any hardware store. 
It's best to use regular 95-5 lead-tin solder (the 
type without a flux core), and acid-type solder. 
Making a good leakproof joint is easy. Clean 
the end of the tube to be connected and the 
inside of the fitting thoroughly with the steel wool 
or emery paper. You just have to get the surfaces 
shiny. Don't sand them down too much or you'll 
destroy the tight fit. This should be done im-
mediately before you smear on the flux. (If you 
wait even as little time as an hour before solder-
ing, the surfaces will have time to oxidize again, 
and you may not get a true bond.) 
Use your finger to apply a generous film of flux 
to both surfaces, and fit the joint together. Now 
heat both the end of the tube and the fitting, 
while you touch the end of the solder wire to the 
joint. (Try not to get the flux so hot that it starts to 
sizzle.) Be sure to heat the connection thoroughly 
on both sides. 
When the temperature of the copper is right, 
the solder will suddenly melt and flow evenly into 
and around all sides of the joint. If you're doing 
this for the first time it may seem like magic to 
you, since the solder even flows uphill as a result 
of the strong capillary action created by the flux. If 
everything has gone well, you should have a per-
fectly watertight joint (Figure 74). 
Don't be stingy with solder. It's cheap, and if 
you drip a little on the floor you won't have lost 
that much. A drippy joint, where too much solder 
has been used, is better than one where there's 
too little — even though it may not look quite so 
professional. With practice you can learn to wipe 
the joint quickly with a rag before the solder has 
set up. But be careful at first not to burn yourself. 
One of the trickiest places to make plumbing 
connections is immediately under the roof. Here 
you have to work with the torch close to the raf-
ters and roofing — which can be a fire hazard. It 
might be a good plan to stick a piece of asbestos 
or aluminum flashing temporarily between the 
joint and the wood so you don't burn the house 
down with the propane torch. 
Automobile radiator hose and hose clamps, by 
the way, can get you out of some tight plumbing 
jams. These might be useful when you're making 
those connections through the roof to your 
header pipes (Figure 75). 
Once everything is together, you should test 
your system for leaks before you run any fluid 
through it. It's virtually impossible to solder or 
resolder lines that are filled with water. The water

Figure 74. Copper tubing can be cut with a hacksaw, 
but you'll do a neater job if you set the tube in a pre-
made "jig" first (a). A small tube cutter (b) is a fairly 
inexpensive tool, and is easy to use. It makes a perfect 
cut every time. Before a connection is made the out-
side of the tubing and the inside of the fitting have to 
be cleaned with steel wool or some fine abrasive pa-
per. This is done best with a rotary motion (c). After the 
flux is applied, the joint should be fitted together and 
heated. Don't try to heat the solder wire directly. It will 
melt into the joint whenever the copper has reached 
the right temperature. 
Figure 75. High-temperature rubber hose — car 
radiator hose — can help you make some of the more 
difficult connections in your system. One of the hard-
est places to solder is directly under the roof rafters. 
This is the easy way out, but use it as a last resort. 
Leaks can be a problem at these joints. An easy solu-
tion is to use threaded connections with Teflon pipe 
dope here. This stuff is normally used to seal joints in 
freon lines for refrigeration systems. (Radiator hose, 
of course, should be insulated like all of the other tub-
ing.) 
71 

cools the surfaces too much to allow the solder 
to flow properly. Nothing is more annoying than 
having to drain a whole system and start all over 
again if you discover one leak. 
The easiest way to test for leaks is to use air 
pressure. Thread a small "snifter valve" — a 
small fitting to which a hose can be attached — 
into a 1/8 inch tapping anywhere in the lines. 
(This can be done at any special tee that has a 
threaded hole to accept a gauge, thermometer or 
air vent fitting.) Attach the air pump hose to the 
snifter. Pump the lines full of air to a pressure of 
20 psi, and then paint each joint with a mixture of 
soap and water. Check every connection for air 
bubbles, and resolder any one that looks suspi-
cious. Once there are no air bubbles and the 
system has held 20 pounds of air pressure for an 
hour or so, everything is probably fine and you 
can remove the air pump. 
How do you fill the system for the first time? 
Rent or borrow a centrifugal pump, jet pump or 
sump pump. Open all the valves in the lines — if 
you have them — and connect the pump hose at 
the boiler drain in the base of the system. Once 
fluid has been pumped in and circulated through 
the system at a pressure of 15 to 20 psi, all valves 
can be closed gradually, and the hoses for the 
centrifugal pump removed. From then on, your 
regular pump (or the thermosyphoning effect) 
can handle the circulation (Figure 76). (More on 
regular circulation pumps in Chapter 9.) 
What About Antifreeze? 
Don't use ordinary — and poisonous — automo-
tive antifreeze. The very best antifreeze for solar 
collectors is something called "non-toxic propy-
lene glycol." You should be able to find it in any 
plumbing supply store. If not, order Sansol 60 
from Sunworks, Box 1004, Mew Haven, Connect-
icut 06508. (Also see appendix.) 
Five gallons should be more than enough for a 
two to three-collector system in a normal house. 
(You'll need just about 1/2 gallon of unmixed 
propylene glycol for each 24-square-foot collec-
Figure 76. When you're all finished your system might 
look something like this. Notice the drain at the bot-
tom of the system and the pressure relief at the top. 
tor.) Other special mixes come already blended 
to protect your collectors to at least - 3 4 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
Naturally the whole collector loop should be 
"flushed" every few years and the solution 
changed, just the way you would change the an-
tifreeze in your car's radiator. Propylene glycol is 
only effective for 2 to 3 years. If you use some 
other solution — specially earmarked for solar 
systems — read the label on the container to 
learn how often it should be changed. 
One last bit of advice: In spite of what the 
Wright Brothers said, plumbing doesn't always 
go exactly as planned — no matter how com-
plete your sketches are. (We all know what the 
poet Robert Burns said about the "best laid plans 
of mice and men ...") Be flexible. And if you get 
in a real snag, don't be too proud to ask an expert 
for help.

CHAPTER 8 
Free-Circulating 
Systems and 
Heat Exchangers 
Natural circulation solar hot water systems — 
thermosyphon systems, to use the more techni-
cal term —' have a lot of appeal for households 
that don't need very much hot water. We've 
touched on these a bit already. The real beauty of 
a free-circulating system is that it operates with 
no fuel or power costs — although it needs a 
back-up system, like any other sunpowered heat-
er, to come on whenever the weather's bad. 
Thermosyphoning solar hot water heaters are 
generally not as effective as forced circulators in 
providing a large and dependable hot water sup-
ply, but here are some of the very good reasons 
why people put them in: 
• Fluid circulation through the system occurs 
naturally, without help from a pump, and is com-
pletely self-regulating. As long as the collectors 
can pick up usable solar heat, the heater will keep 
operating. 
• At night, or whenever there's no sun, the circu-
lation stops automatically. This means that no 
electro-mechanical controls are needed to shut 
the pump off when the panels can't collect heat 
any longer. 
• Because a pump and thermostatic controls 
are not necessary, a free-circulating solar water 
heater is at least $200 less expensive to build 
than a forced circulator type. (A simple, direct 
thermosyphon system — including 50 square 
feet of collector, a 40- to 80-gallon storage tank 
and plumbing — should cost no more than $500 
if you do the installation work yourself.) Opera-
tion costs are all but eliminated, too, because no 
electricity is used. And only rarely is maintenance 
necessary. 
In a natural circulation system the storage tank 
must be located above the top of the collector 
panels. For a lot of people this means the tank 
doesn't have to be placed, as some have said, in 
the "cold, damp basement," but in the "warm, 
dry house where it should be anyway." This re-
duces heat loss from the tank itself — and from 
the plumbing — and can save extra dollars in in-
sulation costs. 
Assuming that there is room for a storage tank 
inside the house, the only considerations in many 
cases are, "Where do we put the collector 
panels?" and "Do we have a floor or rafter struc-
ture strong enough to support a heavy water 
tank?" 
How Do Thermosyphon 
Systems Work? 
A syphon, as any elementary science student and 
efficient gasoline thief knows, is a tube that 
transports liquid up and out of a container at one 
level to a second container at a lower level — all 
with the help of atmospheric pressure. As kids we 
made syphons just by sucking air out of a piece 
of hose or rubber tubing to create a vacuum and 
get the liquid flow started (Figure 77). 
In the most simple thermosyphoning solar 
water heater, the main body of water (the storage 
tank) is always located at the highest point in the 
system. Downward pressure from the tank dis-
places water in the cold water tube (which runs 
out near the base of the tank) and eventually 
forces it into the channels of the absorber plate, 
located in the collectors below. 
At the same time, the collectors are gathering 
radiation, changing it over to BTU's of heat that 
are, in turn, conducted to the water (or fluid) 
73

which should be placed at the top of the storage tank

passing through the absorber plate. So cold 
water goes into the bottom of the collector and 
hot water comes out the top (Figure 78). 
Heated water, remember, becomes lighter or 
less dense than cold water, so it rises into the 
tube that runs back to a point about 2/3 of the 
way up the side of the storage tank. The 
phenomenon that causes heated liquid to run 
upward in a tube — in this case from the collec-
tor back to the tank — is called natural convec-
tion, as you may recall. Heat then, plus a syphon-
ing effect, are the two keys to a free-circulating 
system (Figure 79). 
Meanwhile back at the tank, something called 
stratification is taking place. Water keeps cir-
culating slowly in the tank too, as we already 
know, but gradually colder water settles to the 
bottom of the tank while the hotter water remains 
near the top. So there are several different tem-
perature levels, as there must be in any hot water 
tank. This why we can draw hot water from the 
top, and why we can always be sure that cold 
water will run out of the lower line. 
But this stratification is also precisely why the 
tank must be above the collectors. If it were not, 
the system would run backwards at night when 
there was no heat from the sun. If there's nothing 
to keep the circulation going in the right direc-
tion, hot water will rise out of the tank and into the 
collectors, creating an awkward circumstance 
known as "reverse flow." Reverse flow not only 
takes hot water from the tank, it feeds cold water 
in, because the water will actually be cooled as it 
passes through uninsulated collectors at night. 
This is why the bottom of the tank should be at 
least a foot above the top of the collector. Two 
feet would be even better. 
It's been suggested from time to time that a 
thermosyphon system with a tank below the col-
lector could work if a check valve (which only 
permits water to run in one direction) were in-
stalled in one of the lines. This is a great idea in 
theory, but in a typical free-circulating system 
there's rarely enough pressure in the lines to 
allow the check valve to function properly. 
Figure 78. This simple demonstration, which you 
probably saw in the 5th grade, explains how the 
downward leg of a thermosyphoning solar water heat-
er works. If the tube is "evacuated" (air is taken out), 
and container 2 is below the bottom of container 1, 
normal atmospheric pressure will force water into the 
tube. As long as the tube stays filled with water, the 
upper container will drain. This is half of the reason 
why water (or antifreeze solution) will circulate nat-
urally in a thermosyphon. 
74 

In a house with a steep enough roof, a tank can 
be located above the roof-mounted panels — in 
the attic beneath the ridge pole. (There's advan-
tage in this if the attic is heated and well insulated, 
because there's less potential heat loss from the 
tank.) Many people in southern states have dis-
guised their tanks in false chimneys. Another 
possibility: If your house is higher than your ga-
rage, consider putting collectors on the garage 
roof and the tank somewhere higher in the 
house. If none of these locations is possible or 
practical, there's always the ground (Figure 80). 
There are some serious drawbacks to ther¬ 
mosyphoning solar water heaters, too: 
For one thing, the hot water-producing capac-
ity is considerably less than in a forced-
circulation system. Where water is pumped 
Figure 79. In any thermosyphoning water heating sys-
tem the base of the storage tank must be at least a foot 
above the top of the collector. This is to take advan-
tage of the syphoning effect, and to prevent reverse 
flow when there's no heat coming into the solar col-
lector panel. Notice how the tank is plumbed. Hot 
water can be drawn from the top of the tank, while 
cold water comes out the bottom. The gate valves are 
optional, though a good idea. But the boiler drain 
cock at the very bottom of the system is critical. Its 
purpose is to empty the lines during freezing weather. 
Hot Water to House 
Figure 80. Where it's not possible to put collectors on 
a roof and still have the storage tank higher, collectors 
can be mounted on the ground outside the house. The 
panels should be located as close to the exterior wall 
as possible to keep the plumbing lines short. If the 
tank contains a heat-exchanger coil so the heater can 
run during cold weather, the plumbing will have to be 
carefully insulated. Some people protect outside 
plumbing lines with electrical heat tapes. 
75 

through solar collectors, it's reasonable to expect 
as much as a gallon per square foot of collector 
surface per hour in ideal conditions, in a natural 
circulation system, if you're getting more than a 
gallon of hot water per square foot of collector 
per day, your system is working extraordinarily 
well. In other words, a thermosyphon system not 
only starts up slowly, it provides about 1/5 the 
volume of hot water, even though water that has 
been circulated naturally will be hotter than water 
that's been pumped through the collectors at a 
faster rate. 
A direct thermosyphon system, where no anti-
freeze is used, presents a problem other than the 
obvious one of freezing. Because there are no 
corrosion inhibitors circulating through the heat-
er, impurities in the water can eventually cause 
mineral deposits to build up in the absorber 
tubes and plumbing. 
Placing the storage tank above the collectors 
sometimes means structural problems, it's risky 
to have your hot water supply above your living 
space. Even if you reinforce a floor or attic well 
enough to be sure the whole works can't come 
crashing down on you in the middle of the night, 
a leaky tank in the attic can be a real pain in the 
neck. Repairing or replacing sheetrock and insu-
lation, and having to repaint walls and ceilings 
that have been ruined by water can cost more 
than any savings you might make by sticking with 
a thermosyphon system (Figure 81). 
Float-type Air Vent 
Figure 81. Some storage tanks for thermosyphoning 
systems can be installed in attics or even in false 
chimneys. This is a good way to preserve heat in the 
water — If the tank and the attic are well insulated. 
Don't forget that a 120 gallon water tank can weigh as 
much as half a ton, so be sure to beef up your roof and 
floor joist structure. 
A natural circulation system must of course be 
set up so there are no level spots in the lines 
where airlocks can form. All the tubing must 
slope either downward to the drain cock or up-
ward to the storage tank. There must also be an 
absolute minimum of friction within the plumb-
ing itself. In most cases this means using larger 
diameter and more expensive tubing — perhaps 
1 inch or even 1-1/2 inch tubing instead of the 
normal 3/4-inch soft copper. It also means allow-
ing more space for the plumbing — to eliminate 
any bends and 90-degree "ells" — and thereby 
minimizing resistance in the lines. 
Head loss — resistance in the pipes — is 
enemy number one to any free-circulation solar 
water heater. The place where there's likely to be 
the most friction is in the collector itself. Here the 
channels, either on or in the absorber plate, 
should be at least 3/4 inch in diameter. And there 
will be less resistance if the collector tubing is in a 
series rather than in a parallel configuration. 
What this means is that you almost have to build 
your own absorber. Most prefabricated absorber 
plates have parallel channels that are too small to 
allow easy water or fluid passage. 
And then there's freezing. The best rule of 
thumb for deciding whether you can safely install 
a direct thermosyphon system goes something 
like this: If citrus fruit cannot be grown success-
fully where you live, forget it! Even if you can 
76 

grow oranges in your back yard, you still may be 
taking a chance. This means that in most parts of 
the United States, thermosyphoning for solar hot 
water is impractical in a year-round home unless 
the system is set up with a heat exchanger. 
A heat exchanger is a reasonably simple and effi-
cient device that allows you to do a couple of 
things: (1) You can keep an antifreeze solution in 
a closed collector loop that is totally isolated from 
the domestic hot water supply in the storage 
tank, as we already know. (2) And because a heat 
exchanger permits two separate loops, your tank 
can hold whatever normal pressure exists in the 
home's regular water system (maybe 60 psi) 
while the collector loop can have considerably 
less pressure (say, 15 psi). 
Remember that heat always wants to travel 
from a hotter area to a colder place. While this 
tendency can cause troublesome heat loss from 
the storage tank, this same principle makes a 
heat exchanger possible. Heat can be passed 
Figure 82. In a counterflow heat exchanger, two 
liquids move past each other in opposite directions. 
Heat is transferred from one to the other through the 
metal barrier. If a coil of tubing is submerged in a 
water tank, heat is conducted out of the coil into the 
surrounding water, even though the water in the tank 
is not moving. 
from a fluid flowing on one side of a barrier to 
another liquid on the opposite side without the 
two ever touching each other (Figure 82). The 
idea is to give the separating wall between the two 
liquids as much surface area as possible, so that 
a maximum amount of heat can be transferred. 
The most common type of heat exchanger for 
a solar water heater — and probably the best — 
is a copper coil immersed right in the hot water 
storage tank. The longer the coil, the more sur-
face area it has, and the greater the opportunity 
for heat to pass out of the copper tubing into the 
water in the surrounding tank (see Figure 68). 
In any solar water heater, by the way, the sur-
face area of the heat-exchanger coil should be at 
least equal to 1/4 the total surface area of the 
tubing in the absorber plates of the collector 
panels — if the system is to be truly efficient. The 
coil in a typical 120-gallon-tank heat exchanger is 
more than adequate to support several 24 
square-foot collectors. 
You can also buy heat exchanger units that can 
be set up separately outside the hot water storage 
tank (Figure 83). In this case there must be an 
extra loop to circulate water from the tank, 
through the exchanger, and back to the tank by 
natural convection. This loop must be insulated, 
of course. 
Figure 83. It's possible to buy heat exchanger units 
that can be installed outside an existing hot water 
tank. This requires a separate loop to bring water from 
the tank to the exchanger and back to the tank. Nat-
urally this is not as efficient as an in-tank coil. Any 
separate unit like this should be heavily insulated. And 
so should the plumbing. 
77 

If a tank and ready-made heat exchanger 
combination seems like too big an investment, 
there are ways to build homemade heat exchan-
gers that can be used either with thermosyphon 
solar water heaters or forced-circulation systems. 
One of the simplest of these "homemade" 
heat exchangers can be made from salvaged 
junk. The design is by Steve Baer and his 
Zomeworks cohorts in New Mexico. It's no more 
than an old hot water tank that sits in a recycled 
55-gallon oil drum filled with a non-toxic anti-
freeze and water mixture. Heated fluid enters the 
55-gallon "jacket" surrounding the tank and heat 
is conducted to the water inside. In this plan (Fig-
ure 84), the hot-fluid intake for the jacket should 
be at least 9 inches below the top of the oil drum 
to insure good heat circulation within the jacket.

Hot Water 
Cold Water

Figure 84. Here is the Zomeworks heat exchanger. It's 
easy to make, efficient, and cheap. But it should be 
watched closely. If the wall of the tank ever corrodes 
through, the domestic hot water supply will be con-
taminated with antifreeze. Remove the insulation 
every once in a while to check on things. 
Figure 85. This is another homemade heat exchanger. 
If you wrap the copper tubing carefully and use lots of 
solder to sweat the copper to the tank, you will get a 
fairly good thermal bond. "Thermon" cement should 
work just as well as solder. Try not to let the copper 
tubing kink, and be sure to cover both the heat ex-
changer and the tank with insulation. What you see 
here is an example of a double-wall heat exchanger — 
because heat must pass through two barriers. 
Another alternative for an easy-to-make heat 
exchanger is to wrap about 50 feet of 3/8-inch or 
1/2-inch soft copper tubing around the lower 2/3 
of the storage tank. Keep the wraps close to-
gether and free of kinks. Then use plenty of sol-
der to make a good thermal bond between the 
tank and the tubing. Once the solder is in place, 
insulate the whole works. A heat exchanger like 
this can never be as good as an in-tank coil be-
cause there are two barriers the heat must pass 
through — the tubing itself and the wall of the 
tank (Figure 85). 
Whether you choose a free-circulating solar 
water heater or a forced-circulation system is, of 
course, your decision. Even though it has disad-
vantages, the attractiveness of a thermosyphon¬ 
ing system is its simplicity and its low operating 
costs, even with a heat exchanger. But don't 
make a choice until you've read the next chapter. 
78 

CHAPTER 9 
Forced-Circulation 
Systems 
To keep things simple, we'll divide the heater 
into its three major parts: (1) the collector loop, 
(2) the hot water loop, and (3) the thermostatic 
controls. Then, we'll trace the flow of antifreeze 
fluid from the storage tank (beginning at the very 
base of the collector loop), to the collectors and 
back through the heat-exchanger coil. Next, we'll 
follow the path of the water, beginning at the cold 
water supply, as it goes through the solar storage 
tank and existing hot water tank, to the house it-
self. Finally, we'll explain how the control system 
operates. 
Now let's talk about forced-circulation systems, 
specifically, in detail. Actually, we've been discus-
sing them all along, since much of what's been 
said so far leads up to the design in Figure 86. 
But remember that Figure 86 represents only a 
suggested system. It may be more elaborate (and 
costly) than you want, and it may not suit your 
house — either old or new — exactly. 
It's safe to say that you probably will have to 
make some minor modifications. For instance, 
you may decide, after reading the last chapter, 
that you don't need a circulation pump at all, in 
which case your system will not be "forced." 
Even if you decide that a thermosyphon system 
will work for you, you may choose to include 
some of the controls and other gadgets men-
tioned here. 
In many ways Figure 86 represents all of the 
best elements of sound solar water heating 
technology at the present time. At first glance it 
looks complicated and confusing, but it's not — 
once you break it down and understand what's 
going on. 
Each of the component parts — with the ex-
ception of the absorber plate and the special 
solar storage tank — is a standard, time-tested 
plumbing element that should be sitting on a 
shelf in your local plumbing supply outlet. 
There's no more need to lose sleep over the pos-
sibility of your system's failing than there's need 
to worry about a breakdown in your regular 
household plumbing. That's because basically a 
forced-circulation solar hot water heater is regu-
lar household plumbing. 
What's in the Collector 
Loop Besides a Pump? 
The whole collector loop (start #1, Figure 86) 
should consist of 3/4-inch Type L soft copper or 
Type M rigid copper. You'll also need standard 
3/4-inch sweat-type fittings, valves, threaded 
nipples, and other fixtures throughout. These 
should be joined together with high-grade 95-5 
solder which withstands heat better than regular 
50-50 solder. Any threads should be coated with 
Teflon pipe dope normally used in refrigerator 
tubing. Standard plumbing compound will dis-
solve in propylene gycol, and threaded joints will 
quickly leak. 
The lowest point in your system no doubt will 
be where the cold water tap leaves the solar stor-
age tank. Here there should be a short section of 
tubing and, of course, a boiler drain which can be 
used to empty the collector loop quickly. This is 
also where you will most likely fill the system with 
fluid for the first time, so use a drain cock with 
hose-connecting threads. 
Somewhere in the lower part of the loop — 
either before or after the pump — there should 
be a poppet-type pressure relief valve (like the 
Watts model #174A), set to "pop" at 30 psi (Fig-
ure 87). If this should blow for some reason, it 
will dump antifreeze fluid on the cellar floor, so it 
might not be a bad idea to keep a bucket under 
that valve so you can save any fluid that's re-
leased. 
79 

Figure 86. Don't be frightened by this diagram! It's not 
as complicated as it looks. Begin at any one of the 
three starting points and trace the system through 
slowly. The collector loop (#1), the hot water loop (#2) 
and the control system (#3) are all explained in the 
text. 
This pressure relief valve shouldn't cost more 
than $8. But keep in mind that the best ones are 
not adjustable, meaning that you'll have to buy 
one that's pre-set to release when there's 30 
pounds per square inch of pressure or more in 
the lines. This relief valve, by the way, might be 
only the first of several in your collector loop. Plan 
others for any high, points in the system up 
above. 
Also somewhere low in the loop — where you 
can get at it — there should be an expansion tank 
and an air purger (like Amtrol's #443) with an 
automatic air vent (like Amtrol's #701). Excellent 
expansion tanks are sold by Amtrol (model #15), 
Heliotrope General and others (see appendix). 
Don't spend more on one than about $22. 
Inside the expansion tank, where you can't see, 
there's an airproof rubber diaphragm with its 
edges fastened all around the sides of the tank. 
Pressurized air, pre-charged at 15 psi, is below 
the diaphragm, while fluid from the lines runs 
through the air purger above the tank. As the fluid 
heats and expands, the increased pressure from 
the expansion is taken up at the flexible dia-
phragm (Figure 88). 
This is how the system is able to maintain con-
stant pressure at 15 psi. To check on this you 
may want to put in an inexpensive pressure 
gauge ($5) somewhere near the expansion tank. 
An additional option might be to install in-line 
thermometers at various points in the loop so 
you can monitor what's going on with the tem-
80 

Figure 87. Here is a typical poppet-type pressure relief 
valve. A safety valve like this will blow when there's too 
much pressure in the lines, caused by water expan-
sion. The best pressure relief valves are spring-loaded 
and are not adjustable. You'll want ones that are pre-
set at the factory to release at 30 psi. 
Figure 88. When a fluid containing water is heated, it 
accumulates dissolved air, which can collect and form 
bubbles that block the liquid's flow inside the tubing. 
Above is a diaphragm-type expansion tank in combi-
nation with an air purger. The tank maintains constant 
pressure in the lines by taking up the fluid expansion. 
At the same time, more dense fluid flows through a 
lower passage in the air purger. Lighter fluid, contain-
ing air, moves through an upper channel. Here air is 
freed from the liquid, and released through an air vent. 
See the illustration of an air vent in Figure 90. 
perature. A tridicator, a gauge which measures 
temperature, pressure and altitude, is a more ex-
pensive possibility. If you buy one of these you'll 
be saving a tee fitting or two. 
Now the pump: The flow rate through a solar 
collector loop is normally very low — about 5 gal-
lons per minute — so you don't need a very 
strong pump. A 1/20- to 1/12-horse-power (HP) 
circulation pump with a cast iron housing should 
be more than powerful enough if everything else 
is set up properly (Figure 89). 
Whether you choose a 1/20 HP or a 1/12 HP 
model will depend on two factors: (1) how high 
you must pump fluid to the collectors, and (2) the 
amount of head loss in the loop. (Head loss is 
measured exactly with a "manometer," which 
you will have to rent or borrow from a plumber.) 
This rule may help your decision: Generally, if 
you're going to pump fluid to an elevation of 
two stories or less — and have fewer than 6 or 
7 collectors —the smaller pump, costing about 
$61, is adequate. Pumping to many collectors at 
3 stories or higher, you'll need the 1/12-HP 
pump, priced at about $69. 
In either case, be sure you buy a pump that 
won't be corroded by the antifreeze fluid. If some 
Figure 89. A circulating pump like this can be in-
stalled either horizontally or vertically, but it must 
never be put in upside down, or it will run backwards. 
Good pumps like this one have a variable speed ad-
justment, and two different motor speeds. Put isola-
tion valves on either side so the pump can be serviced 
without having to drain the whole collector loop. 
These valves come with the pump. 
81 

of the pumping parts are aluminum, for example, 
the pump will die an early death. As far as we 
know, the Grundfos Corporation of Clovis, 
California makes the best and most reasonably 
priced circulation pumps for our purposes here 
— their models UPS/UMS 20 and GP 26 (see 
appendix). They run on ordinary house current 
(115V AC). They also have a variable adjustment 
for flow control — which is controlled by a handy 
external adjustment — and 2 different motor 
speeds. (It's also a good idea to use the isolation 
valves that are provided. Put them on either side 
of the pump, so they can be closed off if you ever 
have to do some pump maintenance.) 
To keep warm fluid from rising out of the tank 
at night when the collectors are cold (this creates 
a reverse flow, remember), there should be a 
check valve somewhere in the lines. The little 
"flapper" in a check valve — which allows water 
to flow in just one direction — only works right 
when the valve is installed in a horizontal or near-
level line. The most convenient place to put a 
check might be on the same level with the pump. 
If you don't have a handy level stretch of line, put 
in a flow-control value, which can be installed 
vertically. 
So fluid comes out of the tank, past the drain 
valve, through the pressure relief valve, the ex-
pansion tank and the gauges, and is pumped 
through the check valve into the line of tubing 
leading to the collector. There it flows upward 
through the channels in the absorber plate and 
gets heated by solar radiation. 
The line coming out of the collectors should 
run level or even slightly uphill to a float-type 
vapor relief valve like the Amtrol #701 ($8 to 
$12), which releases trapped air (Figure 90). Any 
air bubbles in the lines that have not been 
"purged" at the expansion tank should rise to this 
air vent, displace the fluid next to the float, and 
escape out the top. This type of valve not only 
"bleeds" air out of the system, it also provides 
vacuum relief, letting air into the lines when you 
drain the system. But caution: Float-type air 
vents are delicate. If the highest point in your sys-
tem is outdoors and unprotected, the valve can 
be snapped off by snow and ice build-up on the 
roof. So protect it as best your can. 
From there it should be all downhill — literally. 
(Don't leave any hollows or dips in the return line 
Float Chamber 
Figure 90. A float-type air vent like this should be in-
stalled at all high points in the system. It works like 
this: when an air bubble from the line comes into the 
chamber, the water level is lowered. As a result, the 
float drops and opens the air valve. As the air escapes 
through the valve opening, the water level rises again, 
and the valve closes. The valve cap should be opened 
about 1/2 turn to permit air to escape. 
where air might be trapped.) The hot antifreeze 
and water mixture passes back down the line to 
the heat exchanger coil in the storage tank, runs 
through the coil (giving up most of its heat), and 
comes out cool again at the base of the tank. 
So we're right back where we started — ready 
to have a look at the separate heater loop. 
Cool, street-temperature or ground-temperature 
water (start #2, Figure 86) comes from outside 
the house through the cold-water supply line. As 
soon as it enters your system there should be a 
device known as a backflow preventer. This is 
nothing more than a double check valve with an 
atmospheric vent between the two checks. It 
doesn't allow water to run back out of your sys-
tem (Figure 91). 
If for some reason your tank or heat exchanger 
were to fail and there were a contaminating leak 
82 

Vent 
Figure 91. Here is what a backflow preventer looks 
like. It has two flapper discs — which don't allow water 
to pass back out of your system — and a vent. These 
devices are required by law in many places. 
between the two loops of the solar water heater, 
no poisonous antifreeze could escape into your 
well or the public water supply — although your 
house supply would be contaminated. Backflow 
preventers (like the Watts #9D) are required in 
many municipal systems, anyway. Even if it's not 
mandatory where you live, it's a good safety pre-
caution to have one. 
Once it has passed through the backflow pre-
venter the water should reach a tee. Here some 
will be diverted to supply the house with cold 
water, and some will move on toward a second 
tee. At this second intersection (Tee #2 in Figure 
86), part of the remaining water will be directed 
around the solar storage tank and the existing 
heating element to later be mixed with hot water 
coming out of the tanks. This by-pass meets the 
main hot water line at a tempering valve, which 
we'll approach in our discussion from the other 
direction. 
Water that's to be heated passes through an 
open gate valve and past the tank's boiler drain 
into the storage tank. (Cheaper stop-and-waste 
valves can be used instead of gate valves in the 
heater loop. These have the advantage of a small 
thumb-screw drain, but water has to follow an in-
direct path as it passes through a stop-and-waste 
valve, meaning there's lots of friction there. This 
much head loss is all right if there's plenty of 
normal pressure in the lines — 60 psi, for exam-
ple. But in the collector loop, which has only 15 
pounds of pressure, this much resistance in a 
valve will only cause the pump to work harder 
than it should have to. Fluid will flow straight 
through a gate valve, on the other hand, so use 
only gate valves in the collector loop.) 
once it's in the tank, the water circulates 
gently, picks up heat from the heat exchanger, 
gradually rises to the top of the tank and out the 
tube leading to the existing hot water heater 
where its temperature will be boosted if neces-
sary. This connection between the solar storage 
tank and the domestic hot water heater should 
also have a gate or stop-and-waste valve in case 
you need to shut down part of the system. 
If it's a sunny day, the water should have picked 
up enough heat so there's no need for the oil-
fired, gas or electric heating element to switch on. 
If not, the water will be heated some more to 
satisfy the heater's thermostat, be stored, and be 
drawn off as needed. When someone turns on 
hot water in a bathroom, very hot solar-heated 
water will move out of the heater tank toward the 
tempering valve, where it joins the cold water 
from the by-pass line. 
A tempering valve (like the Watts #70A) is 
nothing more than a mixer (Figure 92). It has a 
small spring-loaded adjusting knob on its top 
which permits you to regulate the temperature of 
the water going into the house hot water lines. By 
mixing hot and cold together, this little device — 
costing about $12 — will adjust water temper-
ature between 120 degrees and 160 degrees 
Fahrenheit, depending on where you set it. (Right 
Figure 92. A tempering valve like this one mixes hot 
and cold water before it goes into the house lines. The 
knob on the top lets you dial a desired temperature. To 
raise or lower the water temperature, anywhere be-
tween. 120 degrees and 160 degrees, just adjust the 
knob. 
83 

after the tempering valve is a good place for one 
of those in-line thermometers, so you can check 
on the water temperature at the valve. Some 
tempering valves have no precise temperature 
settings, just a little dial numbered from 1 to 10.) 
A tempering valve is a nice option — although 
it's not vital. It prevents too-hot water from even-
tually coming out of a faucet to burn kids' hands. 
It also keeps more heat in storage because hot 
water is being mixed close to the tank rather than 
at the faucet. 
After it's past the tempering valve, the solar-
heated water passes through normal channels 
until it reaches the shower head and then runs 
down your back, where it's yours to relish. 
How is All of This 
Controlled? 
You are the master controller because you set 
the temperatures and determine the pump speed 
(start #3, Figure 86). But when you're not around 
to oversee things — which is most of the time — 
a small electrical box with a differential thermo-
stat takes charge. Out of this box run 4 electrical 
lines. Line A plugs into a regular wall socket. 
line leads to a sensor in the collector's ab-
sorber plate. Line C goes to a sensor against the 
side of the solar hot water tank, and Line D leads 
to the pump. 
Electricity runs through the differential ther-
mostat to the wire leading to the thermistor sen-
sor on the absorber plate. This sensor should be 
located on the absorber as close to the outlet of 
the collector as possible, because its job is to 
know how hot the fluid is as it comes out of the 
panel. 
Meanwhile, there's a second sensor at the end 
of a second wire circuit. It has been installed in 
the sensor port, located part way up the side of 
the storage tank. This second sensor's job is to 
know the temperature of the water in storage. 
(Both end sensors should be mounted with sili-
cone fiberglass tape, or better still, liquid alumi-
num epoxy, so there's good thermal contact.) 
Each of these sensors — the one in the collec-
tor and the one in the tank — is about 4 inches 
Figure 93. Thermistor sensors look like this. They're 
about 4 Inches long and have a tiny electrical resistor 
in one end. This Inexpensive part is small, but it's criti-
cal to your solar water heater's control system. 
long and has a tiny electrical resistor in it (Figure 
93). When there's more heat in the resistor, 
there's more resistance to electricity passing 
through it. Likewise, when there's less heat, more 
electricity flows back through the return wire to 
the thermostat. This is how the thermostat 
"knows" the water temperature in both places. 
When the sensor in the collector tells the ther-
mostat that fluid there is, say, 10 degrees hotter 
than the fluid below in storage, the thermostat 
sends an impulse to the pump. As soon as the 
pump receives this electrical message, it comes 
on — circulating fluid through the collector loop. 
When the sensor mounted against the side of the 
storage tank says the temperature there is getting 
close to the temperature in the collector, the 
pump is instructed to turn off (Graph 4). 
In other words, the antifreeze-and-water fluid 
circulates whenever the temperature in the col-
lectors is hotter than the water storage temper-
ature by whatever preset amount you choose. (A 
10-degree temperature differential to start the 
pump, and a 3-degree differential to stop it, are 
typical settings.) That's how the control system 
works. It's pretty foolproof. 
A slightly more expensive variation on a simple 
differential thermostat has a feature that automat-
ically turns on the pump whenever the collector 
temperature gets lower than 36 degrees 
Fahrenheit. This causes warm fluid to circulate 
through the panels, to prevent snow build-up, 
until the collector temperature reaches 37.5 de-
grees. Then the pump shuts off again, because 
the collector is warm enough to melt any snow 
84 

Graph 4. The heavy lines in this graph chart two dif-
ferent temperatures in a solar hot water heater during 
a 24-hour period. One line represents the collector 
temperature, the other the temperature of the water in 
the storage tank. Here's how the day went: 
1. At about 8;30 in the morning the absorber plate in 
the collector got enough warmer than the tank water 
to allow the pump to turn on. 
2. Notice how the collector temperature took a quick 
dip as soon as circulating fluid started to cool it off. 
You can see that it recovered quickly. 
3. At about 5:00 that afternoon, the collector tem-
perature dropped to within a few degrees of the water 
in the tank, as the sun got lower in the sky. At this 
point the differential thermostat instructed the pump 
to shut off. 
4. Because there was no longer any fluid circulating 
to cool the panel, its temperature rose slightly. But 
there was not enough temperature differential (AT) to 
start the pump a second time. It stayed off for the rest 
of the night, as the collector cooled well below the 
temperature of the water in the tank. 
that lands on it. (A differential thermostat like this 
costs about $40, as compared to $35 for a regu-
lar one.) 
Another more sophisticated thermostat has an 
"automatic off which doesn't allow the pump to 
turn on if the temperature in the collectors falls 
below 80 degrees F. (This will prevent the system 
from fruitlessly trying to collect heat on a warm 
night after you've used up all your hot water in 
storage.) The same device can also be set to re-
fuse electricity to the pump whenever the storage 
temperature gets above, say, 160 degrees. 
Any of these differential thermostats should, of 
course, have a manual override. The cheapest 
and best ones come from companies like Rho 
Sigma and Heliotrope General, both of California 
(see appendix). 
The slower the fluid goes through the collector, 
you'll remember, the hotter it gets. But you 
should also recall an earlier lesson, that a collec-
tor is more efficient when more fluid is running 
through it at a faster rate. You can make your 
whole system more productive simply by adjust-
ing the speed of the pump. On a warm sunny 
day, you may set it to run faster; when there's 
haze, it should run slower. Your in-line ther-
mometers will help indicate what to do — if you 
decide that varying the flow rate is necessary at 
all. 
There are some special variable-speed pump 
and differential thermostat arrangements that 
coordinate with a "rheostat" unit. A rheostat 
works like a dimmer-switch for lights. When the 
collector sensor indicates lots of heat in the 
panels, the rheostat feeds more "juice" to the 
pump and circulation speeds up. When there's 
less heat in the collectors, the pump gets less 
electricity and slows down again. These are 
rather sophisticated and hard to hook up. Be-
sides, there are very few thoroughly tested sys-
tems of this type available at this time. One we do 
know about is made by Rho Sigma. Contact 
them for more details, if that seems like too 
much trouble, stick with manual speed control of 
your circulation pump — or none at all. 
That's all there is to it. It wasn't as complicated 
as you thought. We still bet there's no reason you 
can't put this whole thing together yourself, once 
you have the right parts. To be on the safe side, 
though, sketch your intended system on paper 
and show it to an experienced plumber. He'll be 
able to point out any obvious goofs and weak-
nesses immediately.

CHAPTER 10 
Solar-Heated 
Swimming Pools 
We've saved our discussion of solar-heated 
swimming pools for last — not because it's least 
{or most) important, but because it's different. 
On one hand, swimming pools are still consid-
ered luxury items, even in the minds of most 
affluent Americans. Domestic hot water, on the 
other hand, is something we take for granted in 
most homes in the United States. To put it 
another way, we see hot showers as one of life's 
necessities, but heated swimming pools as ex-
pensive frills. 
As we get more and more strapped by our 
dwindling supply of traditional energy sources, 
the public will disapprove more and more of 
burning precious fuels to heat pool water. Already 
legislatures in California, New York and Illinois 
lean quite specifically on pools that have gas-
powered heaters. And laws against nonessential 
consumption of fossil fuels will only get tougher 
as time goes on. 
If you already have a heated pool, or want one 
in the worst way, heating your water by the sun is 
an easy — and acceptable — way out. You see, 
you have two things working for you before you 
even start. In the first place, the pool itself is a 
natural solar collector. Second, it's a ready-made 
solar storage tank. 
When you come right down to it, what most 
people are trying to do with any pool heater is just 
raise the temperature of the water to about 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, and then keep it there. The 
idea, usually, is to extend the swimming season 
for several weeks during the spring and fall — 
and to be comfortable. In light of what we've al-
ready learned about solar potential, it doesn't 
seem that hard to collect enough free BTU's to 
heat a pool that much. And it isn't. 
On a bright sunny day in summer, a typical 
pool will gain 2 to 3 degrees of temperature on its 
own — without help from any artificial heating 
system, solar or otherwise. If the surrounding air 
temperature stays reasonably high at night, so 
there's not a lot of heat loss, the pool will con-
tinue to collect and store BTU's of solar energy 
during the day. This process will continue until 
the water is about 10 degrees warmer than the 
ambient air. At this point, it can't go any higher, 
because it reaches a state of equilibrium: it loses 
as much heat at night as it gains during the day. 
in other words, unless it has some kind of heating 
assistance — or some sort of insulating cover — 
the water in a swimming pool can almost never 
get warmer than 10 degrees above the surround-
ing air temperature. 
How Much Do Swimming 
Pool Covers Help? 
An opaque or transparent swimming pool cover 
— which will transmit solar radiation to the water 
— can give your pool another 10 degrees of 
natural storage capacity. This means that if a 
free-floating cover with pockets of trapped air is 
stretched over the pool at night (and whenever 
no one is swimming), we can expect the water 
temperature to stay at up to 20 degrees above 
the surrounding air (Figure 94). 
Insulating "pool blankets," as they're called, 
pass about 85 percent of the light that hits them 
through to the water. Some are even mounted on 
convenient reels, which let them be stretched out 
and rolled up again without a lot of hassle. Ideally, 
of course, a pool cover should be custom-fitted 
around the edges, so there's an absolute 
minimum of heat loss resulting from evapora-
tion, re-radiation and air convection. (A wall, 
hedge, fence, or wind screen around the perime-
ter of the pool, by the way, is another potential 
heat — and money — saver. This will help to 
keep passing wind from robbing heat from the 
water.) 
86 

Figure 94. A swimming pool is a natural solar collec-
tor and storage area. But we tend to take an easy-
come-easy-go attitude toward free solar heat, letting a 
lot of it escape back to the atmosphere. Air-filled pool 
covers, which let light through to the water, can hold 
heat in a pool and reduce the need for additional heat-
ing. The cover, or "blanket," should stay on the water 
whenever no one is swimming. That's why it's good to 
be able to spread and remove It easily. 
One of the finest insulating pool covers is 
manufactured by L.M. Bearing Associates, 12324 
Ventura Blvd., Studio City, California 91604. In 
the eastern United States the Dearing Solar Pool 
Blanket is distributed by the Sealed Air Corpora-
tion of Fairlawn, New Jersey 07410. There are 
also other fine pool covers. Ask a local swimming 
pool dealer what he recommends. 
There are also some bizarre and interesting al-
ternatives to covers, which have to be taken up 
and laid back down on a pool. One is plastic air-
filled "lily pads" that float on top of the water and 
hold the heat in. Then there are the many-
colored spheres that look like big ping-pong 
balls. In either case, you order enough of these to 
cover the whole surface of your pool. 
Then you can swim, and dive into the water, 
almost as if they weren't there. These balls seem 
a little freaky at first, but they're fun, provide pretty 
good insulation, and are no trouble at all once 
they're in place. (What's most astonishing about 
the balls is that once you get out of the pool, and 
let the water settle down, they will naturally line 
themselves up in perfectly straight rows and stay 
that way until the water is disturbed again — re-
gardless of the shape of the pool.) 
One thing more: Believe it or not, in many 
cases there is already a beautiful solar collector 
right next to the swimming pool. We're talking 
about the concrete deck. (Your feet know how 
hot this can get when the sun is strong.) If it were 
painted a dark color, it could collect an amazing 
amount of heat from the sun. 
Some homeowners have designed portions of 
their concrete slabs to drain back into the pool 
itself. In this case, water is pumped out of the 
pool and through the filter — as it normally is — 
but then gets sprayed gently and evenly onto the 
darkened deck surface. From there it flows slowly 
— and in an even film — back to the pool, pick-
ing up heat all the way. 
A small architectural engineering firm in Vermont has develop
these same lines. They see the whole pool deck 
as a flat-plate collector — literally. The 'steel-
reinforced concrete slab sits on top of gravel and 
is insulated against the ground by sheets of 
styrofoam. The top of the slab is painted black, 
deep green, or some other dark color that will 
absorb radiation (Figure 95). 
When the slab is warm enough, water is 
pumped out of the pool and diverted through a 
series of 1-inch plastic pipes imbedded in the 
concrete slab about 10 inches apart and 4 inches 
below the surface. Needless to say, the concrete 
isn't as efficient as a copper absorber plate, but 
it's more than enough to keep swimming pool 
water at 82 degrees throughout the season. 
Can Pool Water be Heated 
with Solar Collector Panels? 
For some reason, cheaper solar collectors de-
signed specifically for swimming pools are called 
"heating panels" rather than "collectors" — even 
though they work on the same principle. Regular 
collectors — the type we've been discussing 
throughout this book — can be used. But it's a 
little like taking a Ferrari to pick up a load of 2 x 
4's at the lumber yard. 
87 

Figure 95. Using a little imagination, designers at 
Parallax in Hinesburg, Vermont, have built a concrete 
pool deck that doubles as a flat plate collector. There 
are several features you should notice: 
1. The concrete slab sits on at least a foot of well-
compacted gravel or sand. 
2. The slab is "floating," which means that it's not 
firmly anchored to the ground anywhere. This is why 
the edges of the concrete "turn down," or get thicker. 
The turn-downs keep the deck from shifting. 
3. The insulation on the bottom of the slab is 1-1/2 
inch styrofoam. 
4. Between the insulation and the slab, there is a 
vapor barrier. This is no more than a sheet of poly-
ethylene. 
5. The slab is held together and reinforced with steel 
bars running in both directions — as well as #10 steel 
mesh. 
6. The water channels — 1 inch plastic pipes — sit 
about 4 inches below the surface of the deck, which is 
painted dark green. Filtered water is pumped through 
these channels before it returns to the pool. 
This type of solar pool heater is about 45% efficient — 
more than adequate to keep pool water warm. 
Section Through Solar Panel Showing Fluid Passages 
Figure 96. One of the best known and most success-
ful pool heating solar panels looks a little like a black 
windowshade. The water passages and headers are 
extruded right into the plastic, so the whole panel is a 
single piece. 
Large-capacity pool panels, unlike high-
performance collectors for domestic hot water, 
operate in the low-temperature range. Obviously 
there's a big difference between heating a fluid to 
160 degrees or higher on a winter day, and sim-
ply warming it to 82 degrees on an already-warm 
day. You don't need anything very fancy to make 
pool water tepid (Figure 96). 
Today the market is loaded with swimming 
pool panels. Some of them are good, and some 
not so good. Sometimes they're made of plastic, 
sometimes of rubber, and sometimes of metal. 
Most have no glazing because they work when 
the ambient air temperature is high and because 
water circulating through them doesn't need to 
get that hot. 
There are some problems with some of them: 
(Ultraviolet rays, for instance, can raise the dick-
ens with certain types of plastics that contain no 
ultraviolet inhibitors. And ozone will eventually 
break down certain components in rubber. After 
some of these cheaper panels have been used 
88 

for a while, they end up looking like a blackened 
potato chip — curled, warped, chipped and 
cracked. 
Watch out for aluminum panels, too. Chlori-
nated water corrodes aluminum very quickly. 
Again, copper is much safer. Some of the better 
panels have copper tubing covered by an 
aluminum absorber plate. They work fine for 
heating pool water, but, like all other pool panels, 
they'll never be suitable for domestic hot water 
applications (Figure 97). 
Be careful what you choose. There are too 
many questionable manufacturers in this new 
and lucrative field. In some parts of the country 
the Better Business Bureau is actually warning 
prospective buyers against fly-by-night installers 
and distributors of solar pool heaters — all of 
whom claim their products are made with the 
"right" materials. 
Check out the reputation of any company 
you're thinking of dealing with. Find out how long 
they've been in business, and see what kind of 
warranty they offer. And don't swallow any extrav-
agant claims like, "Our system will give you com-
fortable year-round swimming in any climate." 
That's an open invitation to a shady deal. 
One of the oldest and most respected names 
in pool heating systems is Fafco, located at 235 
Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025. 
Fafco has dealerships in many parts of the coun-
try. But Fafco is not the only one; there are plenty 
of other superior pool panel makers around, too 
(see appendix). 
A complete solar pool heating system — with 
panels — shouldn't cost more than $1000 to 
$1500, fully installed. (It could be less, of course, 
if you do your own plumbing.) So what can you 
expect from all this? In Florida, where it's sunny 
and warm most of the year, an extensive solar 
heating system for a 10,000 gallon pool — cost-
ing as much as $2500 —might keep the water at 
75 degrees even between October and April. 
Even there, some auxiliary heating might be 
needed to keep the water very warm. In short, if 
you live in Atlanta or points north, don't rely on 
the sun to keep your pool warm all winter. 
Formed Aluminum Cover 
Figure 97. Aluminum makes a fine inexpensive ab-
sorber plate, but aluminum tubing will corrode when 
it's in contact with chlorinated water. At least one 
manufacturer puts an aluminum absorber on top of 
copper tubing, which cannot corrode. This is an excel-
lent combination for a solar pool heater. 
How Are Solar Pool 
Heaters Set Up? 
The roof of a pool house or cabana makes an 
ideal location for solar heating panels — espe-
cially if the roof faces south. If there's a flat roof, 
or if you decide to mount panels on the ground, 
they will have to be tilted a few degrees to give 
you reasonable heating efficiency. You may want 
to build a rack that raises the tops of the panels 
so they face the sun at a better angle for your 
latitude — even though finding the exact angle is 
not critical. Any structure that supports the panels 
should be super-strong and anchored to the roof 
or ground so the wind can't budge it 
There should be no need to insulate either the 
water lines or the backs of the panels, but any 
nails, screws, bolts or lags that fasten the panels 
should be caulked to keep the roof from leaking. 
(A flat tar and gravel roof may have to be re-
fiinished in spots with hot tar.) It's particularly im-
portant to have the panels secure where the feed 
89 

line and return line to the pool attach, so no joints 
can be broken. 
How many panels will you need? That depends 
mostly on how big the pool is. The normal rule of 
thumb is to have a total panel surface equivalent 
to at least 1/2 the surface of the pool (that's if the 
panels face south or slightly southwest, and as-
suming that they're more or less properly tilted). 
If the panels face east or west, or if the panels are 
lying flat, you may need a panel array equal to 70 
to 75 percent of the pool surface. 
But experience has shown that this formula 
provides more heating capacity than you really 
need in most cases. Remember: Once you get 
your pool water to a comfortable temperature, 
the panels won't do much except balance off 
your nighttime heat losses. Less than 50 percent 
is usually enough panel area, although with fewer 
panels it may take as long as 4 or 5 days to heat 
the pool 10 degrees above the ambient air. But 
once you get there, this 10-degree gain should 
be easy to maintain during the summer, spring, 
and fall, especially if you have a pool cover. 
Pool heating panels, like all flat plate collectors, 
work best when there's lots of water running 
through them. If you keep the temperature differ-
ential between the pool and the water in the 
panels as small as possible — by running the sys-
tem a lot — it will be most efficient. Water should 
return to the pool from the panels no more than 
6 degrees warmer than the pool itself. If it's a lot 
hotter than this, you're not operating at max-
imum efficiency. 
Because a pool system must have a large cir-
culation capacity, and because pool panels oper-
ate at such high efficiency (70 to 80%), you may 
want to use 1-1/2- to 2-inch water mains. And be 
sure your pool pump is strong enough to keep a 
large supply of water going through the panels to 
keep them cool. Most pool pumps are more than 
adequate. 
As you plan your system, try to keep the lines 
between the pump and panels as short as possi-
ble. You don't need to worry that much about 
heat loss, the way you would with a domestic hot 
water system, but you are concerned with keep-
ing head loss at a minimum. The shorter the 
lines, the less resistance in the pipes. Here are 
some other hints to keep in the back of your 
mind: 
1. Make sure your unglazed panels are self-
draining. This is not so much to prevent freezing, 
as it's a fail-safe mechanism. If for some reason 
the pump should fail, water must automatically 
run out of the panels, eliminating any possibility 
of pressure build-up and damage to the system. 
Because there's no glazing, there's no danger of 
damage to the panel when there's no water in it 
Remember too that any self-draining system 
must have an air vent near its top or it will not 
drain. 
2. Keep your pool filter clean. Don't forget that 
you don't have a closed-circuit collector loop like 
the one in a domestic hot water heater. There's 
plenty of opportunity for debris to fall into the 
pool and work its way into the panels. Once there, 
it could destroy them. A fouled strainer and 
clogged filter can bog down the whole system, 
put unnecessary strain on the pump, and slow 
the progress of water through the panels. 
3. Use plastic plumbing. Polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) or chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) is 
much cheaper than comparable copper plumb-
ing. It can be cut in an ordinary carpenter's miter 
box, and be glued together with regular CPVC 
cement. Plastic pipe looses some of its strength 
at temperatures above 180 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and this is why it's not recommended for regular 
domestic hot water. But for a solar heater that 
operates well below 100 degrees most of the

90 

time, plastic will hold up fine. Valves and special 
fittings may have to be metal. When you put 
these in, you'll need special (but cheap) metal-
to-plastic and plastic-to-metal adapters (Fig-
ure 98). 
How Does a Solar 
Pool Heater Work? 
In a fairly sophisticated solar pool system, water is 
pumped out of the pool, through the strainer, and 
through the filter. After the filter it passes through 
a check valve. This check valve is more than just 
an option. Its purpose is to keep water that's 
draining out of the panels from back-washing the 
filter (Figure 99). 
Once it has passed through the one-way 
check, the pool water reaches a critical tee. This 
tee separates the upper panel loop from the ordi-
nary circulation loop. When the pool temperature 
is sufficiently warm — or when there's no sun to 
heat the panels — water circulates only through 
the filter loop. A gate valve in this lower loop, 
immediately after the tee, determines which way 
the water will flow (Figure 100). 
Whenever this gate valve is closed, water is 
forced upward through the panel loop to collect 
heat. When it's open, there's normal circulation 
through the lower loop. This gate valve can either 
Figure 99. An electronically controlled valve like this 
one makes an automatic solar pool heater possible. 
When there's heat in the panels, this valve is in-
structed to close. And when the pool water is hot 
enough, it opens again, circulating water only through 
the strainer and filter. (See appendix.) 
be operated manually or controlled by a differen-
tial thermostat such as the one mentioned in the 
last chapter (Figure 101, next page). 
Water moves up through the panels and 
comes out again — we hope a few degrees 
warmer than when it went in. Near the top of the 
Figure 100. Here is a more detailed look at the critical 
tee that separates the two circuits in a solar pool heat-
er. When the gate valve is closed, water is forced into 
the panel circuit. When the gate valve is open, water 
passes only through the lower loop. 
91 

Figure 101. A solar pool heater has two distinct water 
circuits: (1) the lower filter loop, where water circu-
lates all the time the pump Is operating, and (2) the 
upper panel circuit, where the water picks up heat. 
The gate valve — which can be operated manually or 
controlled by a differential thermostat — determines 
which route the water will take. Note that the thermos-
tat has no control over the pump, but that it can open 
or close the gate valve. The special sensor near the 
panels is Sensitive to both sunlight and heat. 
system it will pass through that same small, 
float-type air vent that appears in a forced circula-
tion domestic solar heater. The panels and panel 
loop will be draining and filling constantly, and 
the air vent will allow air to escape from the lines 
each time the upper loop is filling as well as let air 
into the lines when that loop is emptying. From 
the panels the heated water simply circulates 
through the rest of the upper loop, into the last 
part of the lower filter loop, and back to the pool 
again. 
The all-important gate valve is opened or 
closed depending on the temperature of the 
water and on the weather. Many people do it by 
hand. If you want a system that works automat-
ically, you can stick in a remote-control "sole-
noid" valve that can open and close at a com-
mand from a differential thermostat. 
A common circulation pump for a pool works 
constantly unless it's either switched off manually 
or controlled by a preset timer that shuts it off 
and turns it on again at certain times of day. So 
92 

the differential thermostat, which controls the 
upper loop, is not wired to the pump at all. The 
pump just keeps running. 
But a sensor in the line leading out of the pool 
to the strainer, measures the temperature of the 
pool water. If the sensor says the water's 82 de-
grees (or whatever temperature you want it to 
be), the solenoid-operated gate valve stays open 
and no water goes to the panels. 
When the pool temperature falls below 82, and 
a special sensor box near the panels indicates 
that the temperature and sunshine there is strong 
enough, the differential thermostat tells the gate 
valve to close, and water goes into the upper loop 
to be heated. Whenever the two sensor temper-
atures get within a few degrees of each other, the 
valve opens and the panels are by-passed. 
That's how it works. Simple. Enjoy. Oh, one 
last thing: Don't forget about the sun. It's always 
there, and when it shines, it's powerful and useful, 
as we've seen. It can also give you a wicked burn. 
So keep your shirt on. Especially when you're 
mounting panels.

Afterthoughts 
Everyone seems to be thinking, reading, writing 
and talking about solar energy these days. That's 
good. Mews about solar technology — like sex — 
pops up regularly in almost every newspaper and 
magazine in the country. It looks as though both 
sex and the sun are here to stay. And we can be 
thankful for both. 
But just about everything we pick up starts out 
the same way: "We have too many people . . . . 
We have this terrible energy crisis . . . . We've 
been in an 'our-energy-will-last-forever' frame of 
mind for too long, and so we're running out of 
fossil fuels . . . . We've got to find ways to use al-
ternative energy sources or we're all going to die 
(or at very least, drastically change our style of 
living).... The sun's the answer to all our woes." 
That's the bad-news approach — scare tactics 
followed by unrealistic promises and pie-in-the¬ 
sky predictions. Most of us already know that we 
have very little fuel left, and we're frightened 
enough already. So we don't need more of that. 
Our energy situation is scary, there's no doubt 
about it, but the idea that all of our energy needs 
can be served by the sun is mostly science fic-
tion. We'll have to keep exploring other things, 
too. 
The sun does seem to offer many kinds of 
possibilities. It's always there; it appears to be a 
boundless source of energy, and no one expects 
that it's going to disappear in the next several 
million years or so. In other words, it seems to be 
a perpetually renewable resource. 
What's even more encouraging is that we al-
ready know a great deal about how to harvest 
energy from the sun. But we still need to figure 
out ways to store it effectively for longer periods 
of time than we can now. That's the hang-up. As 
we all know, sunlight is not available all the time. 
So there are some basic and obvious problems, 
such as night, cloudy days, and air pollution that 
screens out useful rays. How do we carry over 
these sunless periods? We can't completely — 
not yet. So when the sun doesn't shine, we'll have 
to fall back on our old sources of energy, at least 
until fact and science fiction can be sorted out 
and 
some truly workable (and 
affordable) 
technology becomes a reality. 
Even so, there has been a lot of excitement 
about experimental solar homes in Colorado, 
Delaware, Washington, D.C., New Mexico, Cali-
fornia, M.I.T., and places abroad. You may have 
seen the stories. These courageous experiments 
hold great promise for our collective future. 
At this writing a "complete" solar home may 
be beyond the financial reach of most families in 
the United States, and there are only a handful of 
builders around who can tackle such a construc-
tion job. But everybody's learning fast, out of 
necessity, and more complete know-how is not 
that far down the road. 
"Plan ahead," as the sign says. If you're going 
to build a new home, design it to be flexible, so 
you can take advantage of some of the new solar 
technology that will be available soon. There are 
already lots of options open to you, but there are 
also some inherent disadvantages and limitations 
that go along with each types of system. 
Give some thought to simple "passive" solar 
systems as well as the more complicated 
mechanized ones. (A thick concrete wall, for 
example, if it's strategically placed, just sits there, 
collecting and storing solar heat during the day 
and giving it off to the living space in the house at 
night.) There's a wealth of helpful written material 
and practical hardware available right now, as the 
appendix shows. Probably the best book on the 
subject of solar home design is Donald Watson's 
best-selling Designing and Building a Solar 
House, also published by Garden Way. We rec-
ommend you get a copy.

Appendix 
The following is a list of manufacturers that have 
moved into the solar energy field as of October, 
1977. As the solar market grows, this list will be-
come less and less complete. For updates, more 
details on each of these components and/or sys-
tems, and for information about special features 
and options, installation requirements, mainte-
nance 
requirements, guarantees, warranties, 
manufacturers' technical services, availability, re-
gional applicability and prices, consult the Solar 
Age Catalog: A Guide to Solar Energy Knowl-
edge and Materials. It's published by SolarVision, 
Inc., P.O. Box 305, Dover, NJ 07801. The Solar 
Age Catalog's first edition, which appeared in 
September, 1977, is done by the same people 
who publish Solar Age magazine, perhaps the 
finest periodical dealing with practical application 
of solar energy. The price of their catalog is 
$8.50.

There's a bright day ahead in using the sun to 
heat our homes — even to make electricity. But you 
can harness that free energy right now to heat your 
home's water. And a quarter of most home fuel bills 
comes from heating water. 
Here is the book that tells and shows just how 
to plan, construct and install your own solar water 
heat system, one that will pay for itself in as little as 
eight years. After that your hot water is largely free! 
In warm climates or for a summer camp, a sim-
ple thermosyphon system will provide abundant hot 
water and for an outlay of $100 to $500. A full and 
automated system for deep snow country — to sup-
ply all not water in summer and much of it in winter 
— will cost under $2,000, or perhaps $700 more if 
you hire all the work done. 
Author Campbell and Consultant Taff, aided by 
special illustrations by Robert Vogel, cover all the 
areas of solar water heating, both home-
constructed and from manufactured components. 
The chapters cover: 
The dollars and cents in solar heat systems 
and the savings to be gained. 
How the sun "works," and thus how 
we must adapt to it. 
Chosing the right solar heat system 
for your house. 
Building your own collectors. 
Building the heat storage system. 
i3uilding the heat transfer system. 
Free-circulation systems and 
heat exchangers. 
Forced-circulation systems. 
Solar-heated swimming pools. 
Here is the book on solar water heating, cover-
ing the pros and cons of the several types — all fully 
tested and with cost evaluations, details for building 
and assembling. The book carried up-to-date 
product evaluations and manufacturer listings.
