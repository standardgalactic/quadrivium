To Dr. James Howard Cremin, who, along with his family, gave me a place

managed to keep his cool when I blew out half the electricity in his house 
one Christmas morning. Sorry about that.

A C K N O W L E D G M E N T S
There are a good number of people who deserve thanks for the help and 
support they provided either while or before this book was written, and there 
are still others whose help will come after the book is released. I would like to 
acknowledge all of them now.
Starting with my family, I’d like to thank Sumire, as always, for her 
support and encouragement throughout the project. The same thanks go 
to my mother, Dixie Angelina Burckel-Testa, who helped out with the initial 
proofreading of my earlier manuscripts and always lends a hand when she 
can. Thanks go out again to my auntie and uncle, Danica Lucia and David 
Zollars, for their continuous support and help (and for getting me into this 
book-writing business in the first place); and to round out the clan, thanks 
are due to my cousin and friend, Stephanie Garrabrant-Sierra, who tries to 
keep me on track whenever I am on the verge (or in the midst) of stumbling.
In the production of any book, editors are so very important, and I would 
like to thank my editor, David Brickner, who was, in addition to being full of 
good ideas for this book, a whole lot of fun to work with; Carthik Sharma, the 
technical editor, who kept everything I wrote by the book and pointed out a 
few easier ways of going about things (check out his blog, by the way, at 
http://ubuntu.wordpress.com); Megan Dunchak, who had the unenviable 
task of being the copyeditor for this what’s-a-publisher’s-template author—

Acknowledgments
and is cool enough to understand the value of a good D cell battery; and 
Riley Hoffman, who took a whole jumble of files, images, changes, and 
more changes and laid it all out, thus turning it into . . . well, a book.
Of course, as the folks at No Starch Press were the ones who actually pub-
lished this book, a great deal of thanks goes their way. Each one of them has 
been so helpful in many ways: Christina Samuell, who managed this whole 
project (and me in the process . . . yikes!); Leigh Poehler for all sorts of things, 
including confidence building, guidance, and answers to a lot of absolutely 
inane questions; Patricia Witkin for all her work getting the message out to the 
people, being a great email buddy, and turning me on to Haruki Murakami; 
and last but not, as the saying goes, least, William Pollock for not only taking a 
chance on the completely unknown writer that I was, but also for turning me 
on to a great pupuseria in San Mateo. Of course, San Mateo, California is a bit 
far off for a quick lunch now that I am in New Jersey, but . . .
Speaking of New Jersey, it wouldn’t be just of me to go on without men-
tioning a few of the people who have helped me out since my arrival here. I 
would like to thank my old friend David Lohrey, who in addition to being so 
happy to have me out here that he moved to Japan five months later, helped 
me get settled and acted as an ear while I was still going through culture 
shock; Jeff and Graciela Munsey, who helped make me feel at home here and 
so kindly came and looked after my beloved cat every day for two weeks while 
I was out of town; Grace Hsu (now a fellow black cat owner), for her help, 
thoughts, and timely commiseration; and Richard Roy, who helped make me 
feel a bit more at home in the Garden State and continues to keep an eye out 
for my survival in these parts.
Turning now to my friends and colleagues, let me thank Donald 
Hammang—cycle-pal, Windows expert, and keeper of the Great Saw; 
Sheldon Rudolph—lifelong friend, artist, composer, and my original 
compu-buddy from the Atari XL600 days; Steven Young—hiker, environ-
mentalist, birder, ultimate gadget-geek, and the inspiration for Linux Made 
Easy (not to mention the person who first brought Ubuntu to my attention); 
and Tracy Nakajima—my Mac connection and de facto life advisor. Thank 
you all very much. 
And although I am no longer in Japan, thanks are still due to the gang 
back there: my former colleagues Setsu Uesaka, Toshiko Takagi, James 
Porcaro, and Andrezej Kozlowski for their indirect and, at times, very direct 
help while I was writing this book; and Enryo Nagata, Masayasu Tsuchida, 
and Seiichi Mizuta for their time, help, vision, and continued kindness. 
Special thanks are also due to those people who provided me with support 
or helped direct me in ways they probably do not even realize—Dick Petrie, 
Kimberly Jo Burk, Peter and Cate Corvin-Brittin, Charlene Gawa, Leopi 
(Levy) Sanderson-Edmunds, and Olynxa Levy.
Finally, a special thanks to my sweet little black cat and dear feline friend, 
Muju, who, despite vociferously protesting as I spent her time writing this book, 
continues to listen to whatever I have to say and keeps me sane when I’m 
feeling down. Meow.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
My computing life began long ago in the 
Commodore/Atari days. No doubt inspired 
by Alan Alda’s television commercials at the 
time, I purchased my first machine, an Atari 
XL600 with a cassette drive for storage and 16KB of 
RAM—more than I thought I would ever need. Most 
of my time on that machine, I must admit, was spent 
playing cartridge-based games and transcribing pages and pages of machine 
code from the now-defunct magazine Antic to create even more games. 
Eventually, my interest in computers increased, especially after seeing my 
first (and actually the first) Macintosh at the UCLA bookstore. The very 
in-your-face nature of the Mac’s operating system caused me to become 
an operating system maniac. To date, I have worked with a lot of different 
operating systems, including Mac OS up to and including OS X, every 
Windows version from 3.1 to XP, and even IBM’s much forgotten OS/2.
Though tempted to join the Linux fray, I continued to steer away from it 
for a long time because I could not help but see it, as so many others do, as a 
system for never-seen-the-light-of-day-faced, late-night Dr. Pepper–drinking,

Introduction
Domino’s-pizza-eating compu-geeks. However, when I moved to Japan and 
was suddenly surrounded by machines loaded with Japanese versions of 
Windows, I encountered numerous problems, such as language constraints. 
Since everything, including Help files, was written in Japanese, I ended up 
using only a fraction of the full potential of most software. Then there were 
those annoying Windows-type problems, such as the constant freezes and 
restarts and the gradual system slowdowns, which were eventually only 
remedied by reinstalling the system. Getting the software I needed to do the 
things I wanted to do also took its toll on my wallet, and I began to rethink 
my initial resistance to Linux. With Linux’s multilingual support, system 
stability, and extensive and free software packages, there were plenty of 
incentives for me to get over my preconceived notions about the typical 
Linux user.
After a few failed attempts at getting Linux to work on the oddball, 
Frankenstein-like collection of junk that was my computer, I finally succeeded 
with a CD-based Knoppix distribution, which worked well enough to hook 
me in a little further. I moved on to Mandrake (now known as Mandriva) 
next, since that was claimed to be the most newbie-friendly version, and then 
tried out SuSE as well, which I found to be rather quirky. Eventually, I tried 
out Red Hat Linux and stuck to that because it just didn’t give me any grief; 
and I, like most others, do not want any more grief than necessary. 
I started off with my three desktop machines at work and home set up as 
dual-boot systems running both Linux and Windows, but I gradually found 
myself using only Linux. Although I had expected to encounter numerous 
limitations in Linux that would force me to return to Windows often, I instead 
found that I had actually increased my productivity. Other than lack of native 
support for Windows streaming media, I was actually able to do more due to 
the extensive software base that was now installed on my machine. Without 
having to fork out money that I could ill afford to spend, I was able to manip-
ulate my digital images, rip songs from CDs, create vector drawings, create 
PDF files, and do a variety of other things that I wasn’t able to do under 
Windows. It was only a matter of time before my dual-boot setups became 
full Linux-only setups. I ceased to be a Windows user.
Since those early Linux days, I have gone on to try out a number of 
other distributions including JAMD, Xandros, Damn Small Linux, and most 
recently Ubuntu. I am happy to report that things have continued to get 
easier and better, and those early frustrations I suffered trying to get things 
to work with this machine or that piece of hardware are becoming more and 
more a thing of the past. Best of all, with the advent of live CDs, which allow 
you to try Linux out before you actually install it, you don’t even have to take 
a leap of faith to get started. 
Who Is This Book For?
If you are standing in the aisle of your local bookstore reading this right 
now, you may well be wondering who this book is for. If you also happen 
to see my previous books, Linux for Non-Geeks and Linux Made Easy on the 

Introduction
3
same shelf (or have at least heard about them), you might also be wondering 
what the differences among these books are. These questions are reason-
able enough. To put it simply, there are two differences: the experience 
level of the target reader and the distribution covered in each book. Linux 
for Non-Geeks, based on Fedora Core 1, was my first book and was written 
with folks like my mother in mind—average computer users with some 
computer experience in the Windows or Mac worlds who had an interest 
in Linux but were afraid to give it a go. My second book, Linux Made Easy,
was based on Xandros 3 and was written at a more basic level for those 
who just wanted a free and easy way out of the grasping tentacles of the 
Microsoft empire. 
Ubuntu Linux for Non-Geeks, as you might imagine, is based on Ubuntu 
Linux, and like the original Linux for Non-Geeks, it targets readers who 
are interested in Linux but feel the need for a jumping-off point of sorts. 
Although there are some similarities with its predecessor, Ubuntu Linux for 
Non-Geeks is different in many ways. This is not only due to the inherent 
differences between the Debian-based Ubuntu and the RPM-based Fedora 
Core, but also due to the advances made by Linux as a whole. These advances 
have resulted in a system that is easier and more convenient to use than 
ever before. 
If you are familiar with computers, but unfamiliar with Linux, or 
somewhat familiar with Linux but not with Ubuntu, you are essentially the 
reader for whom I have written this book. So to avoid any misunderstanding 
on your part (and at the risk of being redundant), I must re-emphasize that 
this is not a book for seasoned geeks or power users. It is instead an intro-
ductory guide that will provide new users with some hands-on experience 
in order to get them up, running, and comfortable with the Ubuntu distri-
bution of Linux. 
Version Compatibility
This book was prepared for use with Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake) Desktop 
edition. Included with this book is a full working copy of that system on one 
CD, which functions not only as an install CD, but also as a live CD. This 
means that you can run Ubuntu directly off the CD without so much as 
touching your hard disk. You can thus give Ubuntu a try before making any 
hardware commitments. And since we’re talking hardware, it is also worth 
pointing out that running a live CD session gives you the chance to see if 
Ubuntu works with the hardware you’ve got.
If you like what you see and all the hardware seems to work, you can go 
ahead and install the full shebang on your computer . . . and using the same 
disk, no less (instructions included in Chapter 2). 
NOTE
The world of computers is exceedingly dynamic, and as such, there may be changes in 
the software or the links to the files for projects in this book after the book is released. I’ll 
post any such changes at www.edgy-penguins.org/ULFNG.

Introduction
Concept and Approach
As a language teacher, I have always enjoyed programming books, mathe-
matics books, and old-fashioned foreign language–learning texts because of 
their straightforward, skill-based orientation, one in which each chapter builds 
upon the skills acquired in the previous chapter. I have tried to organize this 
book in that manner so that you will never be called upon to do something 
that you have not already learned. I also like such books because they not 
only teach you how to do something, but they also provide you with the chance 
to put those morsels of knowledge into practice with exercises. I have there-
fore included several exercises, or projects, in this book so that you will have 
opportunities to apply your knowledge. This book will serve as a reference 
text and will also provide a dynamic learning experience so you can learn by 
doing, as they say.
The projects throughout this book have a secondary purpose as well: 
By working through them, you will properly configure and round out your 
Ubuntu system so that it can do anything you want it to do. By the time you 
finish with this book, your system will have all the bases covered. If that is still 
not enough to satisfy you, you will be happy to know that you will have access 
to even more—an unbelievably greater amount more—via the online Ubuntu 
repositories, which you will learn how to use in Chapter 5. If your interest is 
already piqued, take a look at these chapter descriptions:
Chapter 1: Becoming a Penguinista—Welcome to the World of Linux
What’s Linux? What’s Ubuntu? What’s a distribution? Can I . . .? Will 
my . . .? Chapter 1 holds the answers to these and many other questions 
you might have as it introduces you to the world of Linux and what it 
takes to get it up and running on your machine.
Chapter 2: Wading and Diving—Running and (If You Like) Installing Ubuntu
The Ubuntu Desktop CD that comes with this book works as both a live 
and an install CD. Chapter 2 tells you how to run a live Ubuntu session 
off the CD and, assuming you catch the Linux bug after doing that, how 
to install the full Ubuntu system on your hard disk as your sole operating 
system or in a dual-boot setup with Windows. 
Chapter 3: A New Place to Call Home—Getting to Know the Desktop
Regardless of whether you are an émigré from the Windows or Mac 
worlds, the Desktop is something you are already quite familiar with. 
Chapter 3 will point out the differences between Ubuntu’s GNOME 
desktop and the one on your previous operating system, and it will teach 
you a number of cool tricks you can use to customize the look and feel of 
things. A couple of nifty GNOME Easter eggs are also introduced.
Chapter 4: More Than Webbed Feet—The Internet, Linux Style
“Have computer, will cyber-travel” could well be the mantra of the 
Internet age, and that being the case, Chapter 4 is an indispensable 
part of your Ubuntu experience. In this chapter you will learn how to 

Introduction

connect to the Internet and set up wireless connections, and you will 
meet the various software entities that allow you to interact with the Web.
Chapter 5: Rounding Out the Bird—Downloading, Installing, and Updating 
Programs the Easy Way
Ubuntu comes bundled with most of the software you need, but there 
is still much more available out there, free and waiting on the Web. 
Chapter 5 teaches you how to easily download and install applications 
using Advanced Package Tool (APT) and Synaptic. System and applica-
tion updating is also covered.
Chapter 6: A Tidy Nest—File and Disk Handling in Ubuntu
From creating folders to copying files to browsing your system and net-
work, all things file management are covered in Chapter 6. You will also 
learn how to work with USB storage devices, burn data CDs and DVDs, 
deal with CD-RW disks and multisession CDs, and create space-saving 
compressed archives of file folders.
Chapter 7: Dressing Up the Bird—Customizing the Look and Feel of Your 
System
Tired of looking at the same old desktop? Feeling nostalgic for the desk-
top in your previous operating system? Chapter 7 tells you how you can 
beat the déjà vu blues by changing the look and feel of just about every 
visual element of your system.
Chapter 8: Simple Kitten Ways—Getting to Know the Linux Terminal and 
Command Line
Many people still shy away from Linux because they perceive it as a sys-
tem in which everything still needs to be done by typing commands. 
That perception is, as the saying goes, a load of squashed avocados. Still, 
there is a lot of cool stuff that can be done via the command Terminal, 
and Chapter 8 will tell you all about it as it tames your fears and piques 
your interest in commands. Really.
Chapter 9: Dining on Tarballs, Binaries, Java, and Even RPMs—More Ways 
to Install Programs
Ever wanted to compile your own application? Or maybe you’d like to 
convert an RPM to a DEB package? Or perhaps you’d just like to know 
how to run a Java application? In Chapter 9 you will learn how to do all 
these things, and you will even find out how you can run some Windows 
applications from within Linux.
Chapter 10: Gutenbird—Setting Up and Using Your Printer and Scanner
Just about everyone with a computer has or needs a printer, and Chapter 
10 tells you exactly how to get yours working with your new Linux system. 
Scanner usage and support are also discussed.
Chapter 11: Font Feathered Frenzy—Adding New Fonts to Your System
Whether you want to use the same fonts that your Windows-using friends 
are plugging into their documents or you just want to add a bit of flair to 
your own, Chapter 11 will tell you how to do it in Ubuntu.

Introduction
Chapter 12: Polyglot Penguins—Linux Speaks Your Language
Need to jot off a note in Urdu? Write a book in Korean? Send a letter in 
Chinese to your friend in Chengdu? All of the basics you need to know 
to read and write in just about any language in the world are provided in 
Chapter 12.
Chapter 13: Penguins Back at Work—Getting Down to Business in Linux
Work can be a drag, especially when there are so many other things you 
could be doing. Still, wearing the ol’ fingers to the bone is a part of life 
for just about everyone outside of a Jane Austen novel, so you’ll be glad 
to know that Linux is a very capable system in this regard. Chapter 13 
introduces you to the various productivity applications bundled with or 
available for your system.
Chapter 14: Brush-Wielding Penguins—Linux Does Art
Those of you with an artistic bent will find Chapter 14 especially useful. 
Working with your digital camera, modifying images, and building 
web albums are just some of the topic areas covered.    
Chapter 15: Tux Rocks—Music à la Linux
Chapter 15 is the music lover’s treasure trove. You will learn how to rip 
CDs, encode MP3 or Ogg Vorbis audio files, and even find out how to 
create your own mix-and-match audio CDs from those files. A number of 
audio ripping and playback applications are also covered.
Chapter 16: Pluggin’ In the Penguin—Ubuntu and Your iPod
Need I say more? Have an iPod? Want to use it in Ubuntu? Chapter 16 
tells you how.
Chapter 17: Couch Penguins—Video and DVD Playback in Ubuntu
Sitting in your dorm room trying to figure out how to play your DVD 
copy of The Baxter on your Ubuntu-ized computer? Just finished filming 
a video of your sibling talking while asleep and want to do some creative 
editing of the evidence? Chapter 17 covers these and other video-related 
topics.
Chapter 18: Defending the Nest—Security
Although Linux is about as safe and secure a system as you are likely 
to come across, some folks feel a bit more secure . . . well, feeling a bit 
more secure. Chapter 18 tells you how to add a few lines of defense to 
your system.
Appendix A: Ubuntu Desktop CDs for AMD64 and PowerPC Users
The CD bundled with this book is designed to work with i386 processors. 
It will also work with AMD64 processors, although not in 64-bit mode. 
Want to run Ubuntu with an AMD64 processor in 64-bit mode or on a 
PowerPC machine? It’s easy enough to do. Appendix A shows you how to 
download Ubuntu Desktop CD images and burn them to disk.

Introduction

Appendix B: Checking the Integrity of Downloaded ISOs
Once you’ve downloaded an ISO from the Internet, it’s best to check its 
integrity. You want to successfully install Ubuntu, don’t you? Appendix B 
shows you how to check the integrity of an ISO in Windows, Mac OS X, 
or Linux.
Appendix C: Resources
Are you crazy for Ubuntu and want to say so? Check out a forum. Do you 
have a hardware compatibility question? Some websites seem to have all 
the answers. Are you looking for free downloads or do you want to read 
up on the other Linux distributions? Appendix C is a great place to start.
How to Use This Book
It is possible, of course, to use this book as a mere reference text that you 
only consult when you have a problem to solve, but that would negate the 
basic concept behind its design. Instead, I recommend that you go through 
the entire book chapter by chapter, doing the projects along the way. This 
will give you a much broader understanding of how things are done (and of 
how you can get things done), and it will reduce the chance for anxiety, 
confusion, and worse yet, mistakes. 
It is best to read this book and complete its projects when you are relaxed 
and have time to spare. Nothing makes things go wrong more than working 
in a rush. And keep in mind that Linux and the projects in this book are fun, 
not just work exercises. The whole point of the Linux world, in my opinion, 
is that it offers all kinds of fun. So go ahead and enjoy it.
About the Conventions Used in This Book
There are only a few minor points worth noting about the conventions I have 
used here. I have put in bold type the items within your system that you need 
to click or directly manipulate in any way, such as buttons, tabs, and menus. 
Where words or phrases are defined, they have been set in italics. Any text 
that I ask you to input will be indicated by monospace font. I have also opted to 
use the more graphically suggestive term folder instead of directory—no doubt 
the legacy of my many years as a Mac user. 
About the Projects in This Book
The projects and other information in this book are primarily geared toward 
users who have installed Ubuntu using the CD that comes with this book. 
Most of the information also applies to Ubuntu live sessions run from the 
CD. You should note, however, that some projects and actions cannot be 
performed in live sessions, as they require write access to your hard disk, 
and this is not possible during live sessions.

Welcome to the World of Linux
Now we begin our project to get you up 
and running in the world of Linux. If you 
have already made the commitment and 
have Ubuntu installed on your machine, you 
are essentially ready to go. Others of you might have 
made the commitment psychologically, but have yet to 
act on that commitment. And some of you are probably reading these words 
in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering about Linux and about whether you 
should spend your money on this book or on a latté every morning for the 
next couple of weeks. For those in this last group, I can only say, “Get this 
book.” Save the wear and tear on your stomach and nerves.
In any case, the first thing we need to do is get you up to snuff on what 
this Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and 
what you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions 
along the way, and if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by 
the time you finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, 
your doubts will be gone and your questions, for the most part, will be 
answered. Anyway, until you are ready to make the commitment, you can

Chapter 1
still follow along, because the CD that comes with this book contains, in 
addition to the Ubuntu installer, a live Ubuntu environment—meaning 
that you can have a taste of the Ubuntu Linux experience without having to 
even touch what you’ve got on your hard drive. You can kick back, put your 
worries in check, and go with the flow.
What Is Linux?
Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is 
really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own, it 
can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. In order 
for it to do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide 
it. The OS takes an essentially well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk 
of a machine and educates it, at least enough so that it will understand what 
you want it to do. 
You already know of and have probably used at least one of the many 
operating systems that exist today. Windows, DOS, and the Mac OS are all 
such operating systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, however, different 
from these other operating systems, both in terms of its capabilities and its 
heritage. Linux was not created by a corporation or by some corporate 
wannabes out to make money. The Linux core, referred to as the kernel, was 
created by computer enthusiast Linus Torvalds, a Finn and a member of 
Finland’s Swedish ethnic minority, who wanted to create a better Unix-like 
system that would work on home computers, particularly his. 
Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the 
world, so to speak, and the Linux kernel, which communicates with the hard-
ware, and makes it accessible to the other applications and support libraries 
created by compu-geeks around the globe who work to make Linux better 
and more powerful. It is this combination of applications built around the 
core of the Linux kernel that is the essence of all Linux distributions today.
Linux has acquired many fans and followers since its creation in 1991. 
Such devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, 
reliable, free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, 
Linux is, on its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, 
and there are no windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and 
comfy once you are behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux 
is still strictly a black-screen, command line–driven operating system. I guess 
you could think of it as DOS on steroids, though a Linux purist will surely 
cringe at the thought. Sorry.
Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by 
typing commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things 
when Linux is used as a server), you don’t have to. It is fair to say that with 
the advent of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI, 
pronounced goo-ee) in 1984, users of other operating systems began suffering 
something akin to GUI envy. They began clamoring for a GUI to call their 
own. The final result was Windows, which gave DOS a GUI and eased many 
command-wary users into the Microsoft world. 
Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go 
graphical. Various GUIs (called window managers and desktop environments)

Becoming a Penguinista
11
and a subsystem with which to handle them (somewhat confusingly referred 
to as the X Window System) were developed by the community at large to bring 
about the change. The graphical desktop environment, GNOME, that is 
included in your Ubuntu distribution is one example of the fruit of that 
development.
About the Penguin
You may have been wondering about the penguin in the chapter title, so I 
might as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as 
the Linux mascot, and what has come to be thought of as the Linux penguin 
was designed by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see Figure 1-1). This explains 
not only the ornithological references and graphics throughout the book, but 
also why there are so many penguin icons in Linux distributions and so many 
programs that include penguin or Tux, such as TuxRacer, XPenguins, and 
Pingus. This, combined with the fact that Linux is a revolutionary OS, helps 
to explain why Linux users are sometimes referred to as Penguinistas.
Figure 1-1: Tux, the Linux mascot
Why Should I Use Linux?
People use Linux for different reasons. For many it is a matter of power, 
stability, multilingual capabilities, or even personal philosophy. However, for 
others, crass as it may sound, it is a matter of money. Just think for a moment 
about what it usually costs to get started with an operating system. Go to 
wherever it is you go to buy software, and take a walk down the aisles. Make a 
list in your head of all the things you want to buy and how much each costs: 
an office suite; a game or two; maybe a graphics program with which to make 
yourself look better in your digital photos; and a collection of all those firewall, 
antispam, antivirus, and anti-adware programs that you really need to protect 
yourself in the Windows world. Now do the math.
After you pick yourself up off the floor, you will understand that we are 
talking big bucks here. On the other hand, for the price of this book you will 
have all of the things you wanted and more in the Linux world. Despite the 

12
Chapter 1
worries that many people have, making the move to Linux means not only 
savings for you, but also more computing versatility. You will not be hamstrung 
at some point along the way because you don’t have this or that program 
when you need it most—you’ll have it all from the get-go, or else be able to 
download it easily . . . and at no cost!
You might counter with the fact that there are a lot of freeware applica-
tions out there for other operating systems, but c’mon, let’s face it—these 
are often rather limited in terms of their capabilities. The programs with a 
little more oomph are mostly shareware, and most shareware programs these 
days are limited in some way, or they only let you use them for a short time 
unless you are willing to pay for them. Sure, their costs are relatively low, but 
$25 here and $35 there eventually adds up to a considerable chunk of change. 
There is also the problem that some of these programs, unbeknownst to you, 
install backdoors, or keyloggers, or make your system a sudden garden of 
adware. Finally, at least in my experience, the majority of such programs 
are hardly worth the money asked. The only shareware programs I ever 
found worth buying were Lemke Software’s GraphicConverter and Plasq’s 
Comic Life, both for the Mac.
Is It All Just About Money?
While money is important to the average user, it is certainly not the only 
reason for taking the Linux plunge; there are a variety of other reasons as 
well. As I mentioned before, Linux is noted for its stability. Try running your 
present system for a month without restarting and see what happens. Linux 
has been known to run without a reboot for over a year without a hitch or 
decrease in performance. With its multilingual capabilities, Linux is also a 
perfect choice for language students or users in a multilingual environment. 
In addition, Linux is infinitely customizable: You can get your system to 
look and act the way you want it to without being wizarded to death. And 
then there are the applications that come with most Linux distributions. In 
addition to their wide variety, most are well up to industry snuff, with some, 
such as Evolution and the GIMP, being sources of envy for those outside 
the Linux world.
Finally, with the advent of Microsoft’s new Windows Vista system and its 
more demanding hardware requirements (especially if you want to take 
advantage of its most touted new features), you may find your present machine 
on the fast track to obsolescence. Turning it into a Linux machine will ensure 
it several more years of working life. Shame to put good hardware out to 
pasture so early, after all. 
But Is Linux Really Ready for the Desktop?
Despite the advances Linux has made in recent years, this question still 
pops up quite often, and that’s fair enough. But consider this: When 
you install a program on your present Windows system and get an error 
message saying that the program can’t run because some DLL file is 

Becoming a Penguinista
13
missing, or when you connect a piece of hardware and can’t get it to run, 
no one asks if that operating system is ready for the desktop. 
In my own experience, I have found no reason to doubt that Linux is 
ready. Sure, Linux has its occasional quirks, but so does every other operating 
system. Linux is ready and able. If my mother, hardly a computer wiz, can do 
the work she needs to do and can keep herself amused till the middle of the 
night using her Linux system (without blowing the whole thing up), then I 
think it’s pretty safe to say that you’ll do all right too. 
What Is a Distribution?
An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lot of different 
functions. And because there is no Linux corporation to package and 
distribute the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your 
computer in working order, along with the applications that you are likely to 
want, has fallen to a varied group of entities—companies, universities, user 
groups, and even private individuals. These entities create Linux system and 
application collections called distributions, or distros. You could bypass such 
distros and try to collect everything you’d need to set up a system all on your 
own, but you would undoubtedly lose your mind in the process. Most people, 
even the geekiest, opt for the distros. 
The majority of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience, 
basically consist of the same main elements: the core operating system 
(better known as the Linux kernel), some sort of installer program to get all 
the system parts and applications properly installed on your machine, the 
X Window System to provide graphical interface support, one or more 
graphical desktop environments, and a series of applications, such as word 
processors, audio players, and games, as well as all the files needed to make 
these things work.
There are, of course, a large number of distros. Some are geared toward 
specific audiences, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, program-
mers, system administrators, and specific language users. What makes each 
distro different is the specific software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, 
as well as other convenience features like the package, or application, instal-
lation mechanism, and the installer for the system itself. Some distros are 
especially appropriate for home users due to their ease of installation. Ubuntu, 
a relative newcomer to the Linux world, is one of these, joining other distros 
that have long been popular in the ease-of-use arena, such as Mandrake, SUSE, 
and Fedora Core. There are also many other new distros, like Xandros and 
Linspire, that are specifically geared toward making the transition for Windows 
users easier. While many of these entities charge for their distros, most also 
provide them free for download.
What Is Ubuntu?
Ubuntu is a completely free, easy-to-use, and extremely popular Linux distri-
bution that is geared toward the desktop user. It is one of the hottest Linux 
distros in the marketplace today. It is also one of the few Linux distros with 
what could be described as a social agenda behind it.

Chapter 1
Ubuntu was the brainchild of South African millionaire entrepreneur 
Mark Shuttleworth, who is probably better known for being one of the first 
space tourists—the first African in space, to be exact. Shuttleworth invested 
over $10 million starting up the Ubuntu Foundation based on his belief in 
free software and in order to fix what he describes as “bug #1”—Microsoft’s 
dominance of the desktop PC marketplace. As Shuttleworth states in his 
blog (available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth): 
I believe that free software brings us into a new era of technology, 
and holds the promise of universal access to the tools of the 
digital era. I drive Ubuntu because I would like to see that 
promise delivered as reality.
As you can see, it’s a vision thing.
Befitting the nationality and goals of the man who brought it into 
being, the word ubuntu comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu,
according to Wikipedia, is a concept meaning something along the lines 
of humanity toward others or I am because we are. If you’re interested, the 2005 
film In My Country, starring Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson, although 
not one of the greatest films ever produced, is on many levels a 100-minute 
examination of the concept of ubuntu.
Why Ubuntu Then?
With so many distros out there, you may wonder why you should opt for 
Ubuntu. Well, as they say, numbers don’t lie, and Ubuntu’s popularity is not 
without good cause. These traits are especially crowd pleasing:
Easy to install
It’s fair to say that most Linux distributions these days are pretty easy to 
install (and definitely easier and faster to install than Windows). Ubuntu 
is right in line with these improvements, and the fact that you can install 
it with only a few mouse clicks while running the live CD means it is pretty 
much ready to go whenever you are. 
Easy to use
Ubuntu is easy to use in that it is very Windows-like in operation, and yet 
it’s more Linux-like than other Windows user–oriented distributions.
DEB based
Ubuntu is based on the Debian distribution, which means that it utilizes 
Debian’s very convenient DEB package system for application handling 
and installation. The two preconfigured, graphical package installers that 
come with Ubuntu make installing applications even easier. There are so 
many packages available for Debian systems like Ubuntu that you are likely 
to find more software out there than you’ll ever know what to do with. 
Up to date
Some distros are updated at a snail’s pace, while others strive to be so 
cutting edge that they are often plagued with bugs. Ubuntu, with its 
reasonable six-month release cycle, tries to stay as up-to-date as possible, 
while at the same time making sure that things are not released before 
they are ready for prime time. In this way, you are ensured of having an 
up-to-date yet less buggy distro at your disposal.

15
Dependable and robust
I know these terms come across as mere hype, but after you smack Ubuntu 
around a bit, you come to understand what they mean. Knock things 
down and around, and they bounce right back—this is very important 
for beginners who often have a knack for screwing things up. Nothing 
turns a new user off more than a twitchy system that has to be velvet 
gloved all the time.
Desktop user–oriented
A lot of Linux distributions, although quite capable in the desktop arena, 
cater more to geeks and developers, taking up valuable disk space with a 
lot of junk you’ll probably never use. Ubuntu’s purpose is to grab desk-
top market share from the Redmond folks, so the needs of the common 
end user are always in mind. The result is that Ubuntu’s GNOME desk-
top environment is a very comfy place for the average desktop user to be.
Hardware Compatibility
Well, enough of this background babble; it’s time to get things rolling. If you 
haven’t installed Linux on your machine yet and are wondering whether you 
can, it is relatively safe to say that Ubuntu will run on most machines out 
there today. Of course, this statement comes with a major caveat: You just 
never know until you get up and running. There are so many minor parts 
to your machine that it is difficult to say whether each part will cooperate 
with your installation. Ignoring minor parts for the time being, there are 
video cards, sound chips, LAN cards, monitors, and so on, and they all need 
to be considered. 
Diving In
If you are going to buy a new machine on which to run Ubuntu, then it is 
reasonable enough to do a bit of worrying and check things out first, but if 
you are going to install it on the machine you have, I recommend just diving 
in. After all, you don’t really have to install anything the first time out. You 
have a live CD right here in this book, after all, so you can just pop that CD 
in your drive, boot up your machine, and, biff, bam, zowie, you’ll be up and 
running (or not) in a minute or two. If everything seems to be going as it 
should . . . well, your worries are over, and you can go ahead and install the 
system when you’re ready and willing. That is one of the Ubuntu advantages—
not only do all the essentials fit on a single CD (compared to four or more 
for other distros), but that CD is both a live operating environment and the 
installer! You can’t get much more convenient than that. 
When Research Is Required
If things don’t work out for you with the live CD, you can search the Web to see 
if you can identify what part of your hardware puzzle is causing your problems. 
(Or if you are looking to buy a machine on which to install Ubuntu, you can 
search for hardware that is supported by Linux.) Of course, before you can do 

16
Chapter 1
this, you need to know what models of hardware you have. You should know at 
least what motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, and video 
card you have if you want to be able to find out anything of value. Identifying 
your CPU and monitor should be easy enough, but the motherboard and 
video card may require a bit more searching. 
If you have no documentation that clearly states the make and model of 
these devices, you can find out most things you need to know from within 
Windows by going to the Windows Control Panel, double-clicking System,
and then clicking the Hardware tab in that window. Once in the Hardware 
tab, click the Device Manager button, and see what you can find about your 
system components there. Sometimes the information there is rather limited, 
so you might instead want to try out a shareware application such as HWiNFO 
(www.hwinfo.com) or Sandra (www.sisoftware.net) to get more useful details, 
such as the specifications of your motherboard or the supported video 
modes for your present setup (see Sandra in Figure 1-2).
Figure 1-2: Finding out your hardware details from within Windows with Sandra
Both HWiNFO and Sandra should give you the information you need 
about your motherboard, but if they don’t (or if you don’t feel like bothering 
with them), you can always just open up the case of your computer and look 
at your board. You needn’t worry about damaging anything because you don’t 
need to touch anything—so don’t. You may need a flashlight to find it, but 
the model name and number should be stamped on there somewhere, 

Becoming a Penguinista
17
either in the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example, 
says quite clearly in the middle of the board, AOpen MX46-533V. You should 
be looking for similar information.
Once you have all your information, you can do a variety of things to 
check out your hardware’s compatibility with Ubuntu. You can simply do a 
Yahoo! or Google search by entering your motherboard’s make and model 
plus the word Linux. This works for other hardware devices too. 
You can also post a question to the Ubuntu User Forums (at www
.ubuntuforums.org) or one of the other various Linux forums or mailing 
lists on the Web. A listing of some of these is provided in Appendix C at the 
end of this book. Just write that you are a newbie and want to know if anyone 
has had any experience using Ubuntu with the board (or other hardware) in 
question. You will probably get quite a few responses. Linux users are usually 
rather evangelical in terms of trying to draw in new Penguinistas.
Hardware Requirements
All worries about compatibility aside, there are some minimum hardware 
requirements that you will need to meet:
 A computer with an i386-based, AMD64, or PowerPC processor
 About 2 gigabytes (GB) of hard disk space, though having at least 10GB 
would be a bit more comfy
 Sufficient memory (RAM)
NOTE
The CD that comes with this book is designed to work on machines with i386-based 
processors (basically, all the Pentium chips, including Celeron, Xeon, and the new 
Core Duo, as well as processors from AMD). Though this CD will install Ubuntu on 
an AMD Athlon 64, it will only run in 32-bit mode. To make full use of your Athlon 64 
processor, you need to download the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. The included CD 
will not work on PowerPCs.
As for RAM, the official specs tell you that you need a minimum of 
128 megabytes (MB) to run Ubuntu. While you can no doubt get by with 
this, you’d get by much better with more. My basic rule of thumb, no matter 
what OS I am dealing with, is that you need the recommended (not the mini-
mum) memory plus at least 128MB. Regardless of what the official specs say, 
put in more. You won’t regret it. 
Saying that the more memory you have, the better, may sound a bit simple, 
and perhaps even cavalier, but trust me on this one. When you have too little 
memory, no matter what system you are running, weird things happen: Appli-
cations seem to take years to open, or don’t open at all; menus take forever 
to render their little icons; freezes and general system meltdowns just happen 
much more often. 
To be realistic and exceedingly honest, I would say that 256MB is the 
absolute minimum you want to have. I personally would recommend that 
you have at least 384MB of RAM in order for things to move smoothly and 
comfortably. It is such a waste to have a pretty speedy CPU and not be able 

18
Chapter 1
to appreciate it because its hands are tied by a lack of memory. It is sort of 
like trying to do jumping jacks in a broom closet. Sure, you could do it, but 
you would be all contorted, and you’d be smashing your hands into the 
walls every 1.4 seconds. 
Fortunately, it is pretty hard to find a machine with only 128MB of RAM 
these days, but if you do happen to have such a beastie, you can at least take 
solace in the fact that memory is relatively cheap, so go for it. 
Good News for Mac and AMD64 Users
It is again important to mention that the CD that comes with this book is 
designed to work on machines with i386-based processors, which pretty much 
covers the vast majority of PCs out there. If your machine has an AMD64, you 
will be glad to know that it will also work, albeit not in 64-bit mode. And if 
you’re a Mac user with a PowerPC architecture machine? Sorry, but no go. 
Fortunately there is good news for those of you who were a bit dis-
appointed by the content of that previous paragraph. Ubuntu is available 
in native AMD64 and PowerPC versions. Check Appendix A for information 
on how to get them. The information provided there will also be of use to 
i386 users who happen to lose or damage the disk that comes with this book.
Speaking Ubuntu
It’s worth noting that there are a lot of weird phrases you are bound to come 
across when dealing with Ubuntu, especially when searching for information 
on the Net. In particular, I am referring to four seemingly incongruous 
phrases: Warty Warthog, Hoary Hedgehog, Breezy Badger, and Dapper Drake.
These are the unlikely code names of each of the releases of Ubuntu since 
its first appearance in 2004. The important one for you to remember is that 
of the current release (the one on the CD that comes with this book): 
Dapper Drake. In the future, when you upgrade to the next release, you will 
be upgrading to Edgy Eft. Hmmm.
You are also likely to come across a few other variations of the Ubuntu 
theme. These are Kubuntu, a KDE-based version of Ubuntu; Edubuntu, a 
special version of Ubuntu designed for use in the classroom; and Xubuntu, 
which is a lightweight version of Ubuntu based on the XFCE desktop.
Where Do I Go from Here?
Now that you know more about the world of Linux and Ubuntu, and you’ve 
got your disk in hand, it’s time to get down to it. If you have already installed 
Ubuntu on your machine, just flip ahead to Chapter 3. If your machine is still 
Linuxless, though, it’s time to take it out for a spin and see if you like it. So 
for now, strap yourself down in front of that computer, clip on your spurs, 
and go straight to the next chapter. It’s time to become a Penguinista!

Running and (If You Like) Installing Ubuntu
As I have already mentioned, one of the 
great things about Ubuntu is that it comes 
on a live CD, which means that you can try it 
out before you install it . . . or never install it at 
all, if that’s what you prefer. Better yet is the fact that, 
unlike earlier editions of Ubuntu, you don’t need an 
additional installation CD if you do choose to install it—the Ubuntu Desktop 
CD functions as both a live and an install CD. And while in the good-better-
best swing of things, the best point of all is that installation from the live CD 
is actually much, much easier than any other installation process you’ve ever 
dealt with.
In this chapter, I will be covering the basics of starting up and running 
Ubuntu from the live CD, and then, assuming you’ve caught the Linux bug, 
the painless steps to installing the system on your hard disk. Let’s put this 
book to use and get Ubuntu up and running. . . .

Chapter 2
Going in for a Dip
To get a taste of what Ubuntu is all about (and to check out your hardware 
to see if it’s all comfy-cozy with Ubuntu), there is probably no better way to 
go than to run Ubuntu directly from the live CD. To do this, just place the 
Ubuntu Desktop CD in your disk drive and restart your machine. When the 
machine starts up again, it should boot up from the CD, and, after a bit of 
white text scrolls up the screen, you should see the first Ubuntu startup 
screen (Figure 2-1). If the screen does not appear, and your machine instead 
boots up into your usual operating system, then it is very likely that your 
machine’s BIOS needs to be changed so as to allow you to boot from CD. 
Figure 2-1: An Ubuntu live session startup screen
You can access your machine’s BIOS by restarting and then pressing 
whatever key the onscreen startup instructions assign to accessing the BIOS 
setup. This is usually DELETE or F1, but not all machines are the same. If the 
onscreen information passes by so fast that you miss it, you can check your 
user’s manual to see what the correct key is. Once you get into the BIOS 
setup, change the boot sequence so that your CD drive is first.
Once your machine does boot from the live CD, and you do see the 
Ubuntu live session startup screen shown in Figure 2-1, either press ENTER or 
just do nothing for about 30 seconds in order to continue. This will start up 
your Ubuntu in English with a US keyboard layout. Remember, your hard 
disk will go untouched, so rest easy—you’re not going to touch, let alone 
hurt, anything. 
If you would like your system to appear in a different language, press F2, 
select your language of choice using the cursor keys, and then press ENTER.
You can change the default keyboard layout by pressing F3 and then follow-
ing the same steps. Once you’re done, press ENTER to start up the system. 

Wading and Diving
21
NOTE
Special input mechanisms required for typing in certain languages (i.e., Chinese, 
Japanese, and Korean) are not supported in live CD sessions.
From then on out, it is strictly autopilot time for you—all you have to do 
is wait. There will be some scrolling white text now and then, and an occa-
sional period when things will go black for a few seconds, but eventually 
things will go totally graphical when the GNOME desktop environment 
begins its initialization process, and when that is done . . . well, you will be 
face to face with the Ubuntu desktop, meaning you’re ready to roll—but 
I’ll hold off on talking about that until Chapter 3.
Taking the Plunge—Installing Ubuntu
If you have already installed Ubuntu on your machine, are satisfied running 
it from the live CD, or still haven’t made up your mind what to do, you can 
skip right over the rest of this chapter and go on to the next one to get started 
working with the Ubuntu desktop. If, however, you haven’t installed Ubuntu 
yet and are ready and raring to do so, then you had better stay right where 
you are and read on. 
Single- or Dual-Boot Setup?
If you don’t already have Windows installed on your machine, you can skip 
right over this section. If, on the other hand, you do, then you are going to 
have to decide whether or not you want to keep it. 
It is possible to have both Windows and Linux installed on the same 
machine and for them to happily coexist. This is known as a dual-boot setup.
It has also become incredibly easy to set up such a system. I started out with 
a dual-boot setup; however, I eventually found that I used the Linux side of 
things exclusively. Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows 
system I didn’t use seemed a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just 
dumped the whole thing and went for a straight Linux-only setup. My feeling 
is that unless there is some application that you really need that is not avail-
able on the Linux side (probably some game), then go for the Linux-only 
setup and just forget about Windows. Linux has most of what you will need 
anyway, and because the applications in the OpenOffice.org office suite can 
read and write Microsoft Office files, you’ll still be able to collaborate with 
Windows users, if that is of concern to you.
You may be thinking that if you do as I suggest and dump your Windows 
system when you install Linux, you might have to reinstall Windows if you 
don’t like Linux or if you can’t get it installed properly. That would be a con-
siderable waste of time and energy, to be sure. However, believe it or not, 
there are advantages to my suggestion even if your no-go scenario turns out 
to be the case. 
You may have noticed that your Windows system, as you’ve used it over 
time, has gotten sort of gunked up—it is no longer the quick little kitten it 
used to be. Menus don’t pop open as quickly as they used to, things take 

22
Chapter 2
longer to start up than they did before, and you find yourself asking, “What 
the Sam Habberdack is that?!” all the time as mysterious things happen with 
increasing frequency. 
This is just the nature of the beast, and a very good way of getting things 
back to normal is to reinstall the whole thing. So even if you do decide to 
come back to Windows later, you’ll be doing yourself a favor, because it 
should run better than before. It’s a little more work up front, but in the 
long run, you’ll be a happier camper.
If, on the other hand, you opt for a dual-boot setup, from which you can 
run both Windows and Linux, you will have the best of both worlds. Starting 
up in either system is easy. When you start up your machine, you will be 
greeted by the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) screen, from which you 
can choose to continue booting up Linux or choose Windows in its stead. 
After that, bootup proceeds as normal for the system you selected. This 
setup works fine, so you needn’t worry.
So as you see, either way you decide to go, you can’t really go wrong. 
Just be sure to back up your important files before starting the installation; 
proceed with common sense, patience, and a positive attitude; and you’ll 
be fine. In short: Don’t worry.
Getting Ready for Action
There is less you need to do to prepare for an Ubuntu installation than for 
many other Linux distributions. Once you’ve decided whether or not you 
want to go the dual-boot route, all you really need to have on hand is your 
single Ubuntu Desktop disk and, for guidance and security, this book. The 
only mental energy you’ll probably need to expend is to come up with a user-
name and user password, just as you do for most other operating systems.
Usernames and User Passwords
Your username is something that you will be using quite a bit. You will input 
it every time you boot up your system, so be sure it is something you can live 
with, especially in terms of typing. It can be just your first name, or your initials, 
or whatever you want it to be. It must, however, begin with a lowercase letter, 
followed by numbers and/or other lowercase letters. Mine, for example, is 
simply rg, but you could use something like hope4u2pal, though that would 
get rather tiring to type at login day after day. Think of your fingers when 
deciding upon your username.
You also need to come up with a user password, which you will also need 
to type every time you log in. You will need to use it when you install new 
software or change certain system settings, as well. It should be a minimum 
of eight characters in length and consist of numbers and letters (upper- and 
lowercase) for improved security. You can, of course, get by with fewer char-
acters and only letters if you prefer. The installer will advise you if the pass-
word you enter is unacceptable, so don’t worry too much. Be sure to write it 
down and keep the paper you’ve written it on in a safe place so you don’t end 
up locking yourself out of your system.

Wading and Diving
23
NOTE
If you have experience working with other Linux distributions, you may be surprised 
to learn that the root account is disabled by default in Ubuntu. There is, therefore, 
no installation step for inputting a root password. You can check the website for this 
book (www.edgypenguins.org/ULFNG) to learn ways of getting around this setup. 
You can also set up a root password later at any time after the system is installed, so if 
having a root account is of importance to you, don’t worry.
Dual-Booters Take Note
If you are going to be creating a dual-boot setup, it is a good idea to first 
defragment your present Windows disk before moving on to installing 
Ubuntu. This will make the repartitioning phase of the installation process 
must faster and safer. 
You can do this while still running Windows by double-clicking My 
Computer, right-clicking the icon for your hard disk, and selecting Properties.
You can then defragment your hard disk (in Windows XP) by clicking the 
Tools tab in the Properties window and clicking the Defragment Now button. 
In Windows NT, you can do this by going to the Start menu and selecting 
Control Panel Administrative Tools Computer Management Disk
Defragmenter, while in Windows 98 and some other versions, you can do 
the same by selecting Programs System Tools Disk Defragmenter.
Doing the Deed
Well, now that we’ve covered all that prelim stuff, let’s get down to the actual 
Linux installation. Set this book on your lap so you can follow along, and 
then get ready for action. It’s time to do the deed!
Fortunately for you, the installation process is extremely easy, as there 
are very few steps in which you actually have to do anything. Most of what you 
will be doing is clicking buttons on your screen. Nothing hard about that, eh?
Of course, when you look at the directions and descriptions listed here, 
it may look like a long and cumbersome process. It is not. It will be over more 
quickly than you can imagine. As a beginner frequently referring to this text, 
you might take a bit longer, of course, but don’t worry. All in all, the whole 
process is faster and easier than that for Windows XP or Mac OS X. And keep 
in mind that with XP and OS X, you are installing the operating system with 
just a few bundled applications. In an Ubuntu installation, on the other hand, 
you are installing not only the operating system itself, but also most of the 
applications you will ever want or need to use. You will thus be getting a lot 
done in one fell swoop.
One more thing before we start. Some people approach installing a 
system with a good deal of trepidation. The process makes them nervous, as 
if the house is going to go up in smoke if they click the wrong thing some-
where along the line. Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As 
long as you have backed up your data, you will be okay. If you screw up the 
installation the first time out, so what? Just start over again. No harm done, 
as you have nothing to harm. Just make sure that you give yourself more time 

24
Chapter 2
than you need for the process. Don’t start installing one hour before you have 
to be at work or before you have to meet your friend downtown. Rushing 
makes people do weird things. Make things easy on yourself by giving yourself 
plenty of time and, as I mentioned before, by backing up any data you would 
mourn the loss of.
If you’re ready, here are the steps:
1.
Start ’er up
If you haven’t already done so, boot up your machine from 
the Ubuntu Desktop CD.
2.
Start the installation
Double-click the Install icon on the Ubuntu live 
desktop to start the installation. This will bring up the first page of the 
installation wizard (Figure 2-2). 
Figure 2-2: The opening installation wizard screen
3.
Welcome (choose language)
Choose the language you want to use dur-
ing and after the installation process, and then click the Forward button. 
No matter what language you choose, you will always have the option of 
booting up in English once the system is installed. You can also add sup-
port for other languages later.
4.
Where are you? (choose location)
The Ubuntu installer will select the 
default location for the installation language you have chosen. If your 
location is different, select the one appropriate for you by clicking 
directly on the wizard map (Figure 2-3). Once your selection is made, 
click Forward.

Figure 2-3: Choosing your geographic location in the Ubuntu installation wizard
5.
Keyboard layout
The default keyboard layout for the installation lan-
guage you have chosen will appear in the next wizard screen. If your key-
board layout is different, make the appropriate choice from the list. If 
you’re not sure you’ve made the right choice, you can double-check by 
typing a few words in the text box at the bottom of the window. Once 
you’ve done this, click Forward. If need be, you can add other keyboard 
layouts later, after the system is installed.
6.
Who are you?
On the next page of the installation wizard, you are asked 
to provide your real name, your login name, and a password. The wizard 
will automatically generate a name for your computer based on your user-
name (rg-laptop in my case), but you are free to change this to something 
else if you like (I changed mine to UbuntuAcer-RG). Once all of the fields 
are filled in, as mine are in Figure 2-4, click Forward.
7.
Select a disk
If your machine has more than one hard disk, or if you 
have another storage device attached to one of your USB ports, you will 
be asked on which disk you wish to perform the installation. Select your 
main hard disk, and then click Forward. If you do not have any other 
disks attached to your machine, this screen will not appear. 

26
Chapter 2
Figure 2-4: Providing your username, password, and computer name in the 
installation wizard
8.
Prepare disk space
What you are asked at this point depends on what 
you have on your machine. Assuming you have an operating system on 
the disk already, such as Windows, you will be asked whether you want to 
resize the master partition or erase the entire disk. If you want to create 
a dual-boot Windows/Ubuntu (or other Linux distro/Ubuntu) setup, 
choose the resize option. You can, if you like, resize the partition on 
which your present system exists by using the slider in the middle of 
the window (Figure 2-5). Once your selection is made, click Forward.
What happens next depends on the selection you’ve just made. If you 
chose to erase the entire disk, you will be immediately taken to the final 
page of the wizard, where you can begin the installation. If, however, you 
chose to resize the existing partition, the partitioner will begin the process 
of resizing that partition before delivering you to the final page of the 
wizard. The partitioning process can take a bit of time, so sit back, have 
a glass of Inca Cola, and watch a rerun of Green Acres while you wait. 
9.
Ready to install
The final page of the wizard (Figure 2-6) lists the 
details of your soon-to-be installed system and hard disk partition 
setup, along with a point-of-no-return warning. You’ve come this far, 
so you might as well go for it, even though there’s no turning back. 
Click Install.

Chapter 2
The partitioner will then do whatever writing to disk it must in order 
to finish the partitioning process, after which the installation itself will 
seamlessly begin, without any additional input necessary from you or 
anyone else. The progress of the installation will be indicated in a window 
like that in Figure 2-7 so that you don’t have to fret (and so you’ll know 
how much more time you have left to veg in front of the TV).
Figure 2-7: Keeping track of the progress of the
installation
10. Installation complete
As you can see in Figure 2-8, you’ve now come to 
the end of the first phase of the installation. You are given the option of 
either continuing to use the live CD or restarting the machine and run-
ning Ubuntu directly from your hard disk. Well, you didn’t go through 
all of this just to keep using the live CD, so let’s go for the second option 
by clicking the Restart now button, removing the live CD from your drive 
when it is automatically ejected, and pressing ENTER when prompted on 
screen to do so. Your machine will then restart.
Figure 2-8: A final warning before taking the plunge
After that . . . well, that’s basically it. You now have Ubuntu installed on 
your machine. Congratulations. After a few moments, you will see the login 
screen, so to find out what to do then, go on to the next chapter. See you 
there. Aloha.

Getting to Know the Desktop
Now Ubuntu is up and running, and you 
are ready and raring to go. If you are running 
Ubuntu from your hard disk, you will first see 
the login screen that will appear each and every time 
you boot up (Figure 3-1). There’s no need to keep the 
login screen waiting, so type your username, and press 
ENTER. After that, you will be prompted for your user 
password in the same screen, so type it, and press ENTER
again. Within moments, you will be face to face with 
your desktop in Ubuntu.

Figure 3-1: The Ubuntu login screen
Welcome to the GNOME Desktop
Ubuntu’s implementation of the GNOME desktop is shown in Figure 3-2, 
and as you can see, it isn’t all that different from what you might be used to 
in a Windows or Mac OS 9 environment, other than the fact that it has task-
bars, or panels, at both the top and the bottom of the screen. There are also 
no desktop icons, except when running a live session from the Desktop CD, 
in which case you’ll see a launcher to run the installation wizard (labeled 
Install) and a folder (labeled Examples), which contains a number of sample 
files. Among these is a video clip of Nelson Mandela discussing the meaning 
of ubuntu (the concept, not the distro). All in all, it is a very uncluttered place 
to be, and despite its superficial similarities to other OS desktop environments, 
things in the GNOME are different enough to be interesting. 
The main elements of the GNOME desktop are the panels at the top 
and bottom of the screen and the icons that appear upon those panels. 
The desktop itself, although empty at startup, does see its share of action, 
but I’ll come to that later. For now, I’ll focus on the two panels.
The Top Panel
Of the two GNOME Panels on your desktop, the top panel is basically where 
all the action is. As you can see, there are three menus and two icons at the 
left end of the panel, and a few icons and a clock/calendar at the other end 
(Figure 3-3). So that you understand what each of the panel items does, I will 
now briefly describe each of them, moving from left to right, as seems to be 
the fashion these days.

A New Place to Call Home
31
Figure 3-2: The GNOME desktop in Ubuntu
The Menus
At the far left of the top panel, you will find a set of three menus. These pro-
vide access to most of what your system has to offer in terms of applications, 
locations, and utilities. These include:
Applications menu
The access point to the majority of your applica-
tions, a software manager, and some system tools.
Places menu
Your system navigator, from which you can hide all open 
windows so as to expose the desktop, access your home folder, browse 
your computer’s filesystem and connected networks, and search for files 
on your hard disk.
System menu
The access point for your system preferences, software 
installer, and administration tools. This is also the place to go when you 
want to shut down or log out of your system.
Figure 3-3: The left and right sides of the top GNOME Panel

32
Chapter 3
The Icons (Left)
Immediately to the right of the three menus are a set of two launchers. When 
these icons are clicked, they launch the following applications:
Firefox
Your web browser
Ximian Evolution
The very popular Linux email program, scheduler, 
and task manager
The Icons (Right)
At the right side of the top panel are a series of icons that perform a variety 
of functions. Some of these are indicators, while some are applets that allow 
you to perform certain functions. These consist of:
Update Notification Tool
Tells you when there are system or applica-
tion updates and allows you to download and install the updates. Only 
appears when updates are available.
Battery (not shown)
Shows your current battery level. Only appears on 
laptops when charging or discharging the battery. 
Network
Lets you see your network status and configure your network 
devices. 
Wireless Signal Monitor
Shows the signal strength of your current 
wireless connection, if you have one, and allows you to switch from 
one wireless access point to another. 
Volume Control
A volume controller. Duh.
Calendar/Clock
Date and time, date and time, date and time. Just as 
you suspected.
Quit
Brings you to the logout screen, from which you can logout, shut 
down, restart, or switch users.
The Bottom Panel
The bottom panel, as you can see in Figure 3-4, is a much simpler affair, 
containing only the four items I will now briefly describe.
Figure 3-4: The bottom GNOME Panel
Show Desktop
A button that minimizes all open windows and allows 
you to see your desktop when it is obscured from view.
Window List
A list of windows or applications you have open, which is 
very similar to what happens in the Windows taskbar. 

A New Place to Call Home
33
Workspace Switcher
An application that allows you to switch between vir-
tual desktops. (I’ll talk about this more in “Virtual Desktops” on page 42.)
Trash
There is nothing mysterious about Trash . . . other than its rather 
Mac OS X–ish location on the panel.
The GNOME Panel is not a static thing. You can add launchers (respectively 
known as program shortcuts or aliases to Windows and Mac users), utilities, and 
even amusements to make it do almost anything you want it to—within limits, 
of course. In the various stages of this project, you will customize your panel 
to get some hands-on experience working with it and to make things more 
convenient for you as you make your way through the rest of this book. You 
are, of course, free to change any of the customizations I ask you to make 
(though you won’t have a say in the matter if you’re working in live session 
from the desktop CD, as you won’t be able to save your settings).
Each of the following subprojects is very simple. Most are only three-step, 
point-and-click procedures that you should be able to handle without any 
difficulty. 
3A-1: Adding Utility Buttons to the Panel
The GNOME Panel allows you to add a number of utility applets. Each of these 
has some specific function, such as tracking your stocks, telling you the weather, 
or performing some particular system-related function. To start out, let’s add 
a clearly useful utility to the top panel: the Force Quit button. The Force Quit 
button lets you quickly and easily deal with non-responding windows.
Yes, it does happen on occasion: A window suddenly refuses to do any-
thing. Regardless of what you want it to do or what it is supposed to be doing, 
it just sits there as if it is on strike (maybe it is). With just one click of the 
Force Quit button, your cursor becomes a powerful surgical instrument that 
will kill the window you click. You definitely don’t want to be without this 
button, so here’s how to add it to the panel:
1.
Right-click any open space on the top panel.
2.
From the popup menu, select Add to Panel, after which the Add to Panel 
window will appear.
3.
In that window, click Force Quit once to highlight it, as I’ve done in Fig-
ure 3-5. Click the Add button, and then click Close to finish the job.
To reinforce what you’ve just learned how to do, let’s add another utility 
to the panel: the Run Application panel applet. Once you start installing 
applications in Ubuntu, you will find that some of those applications do not 
automatically install program launchers in your Applications menu. This 
means that you have to open a Terminal window and type a command 
every time you want to run such programs, which can get old rather fast. 
The Run Application panel applet is one way around this problem. 
Project 3A: Customizing the GNOME Panel

34
Chapter 3
Figure 3-5: Adding launchers and utility applets to the GNOME Panel
To add the Run Application applet to the panel, just follow the same steps 
you used in adding the Force Quit button; but this time in step 3, highlight 
Run Application in the Add Launcher window instead of Force Quit.
NOTE
If you later decide not to keep the Run Application panel applet on the panel, or if you 
just prefer keyboard shortcuts to pointing and clicking, it is worth noting that you can 
also bring up the applet by pressing ALT-F2.
3A-2: Adding Amusing Applets to the Panel
The GNOME Panel not only allows you to add very functional utilities, but it 
allows you to add quite seemingly useless amusements as well. In this part of 
the project, we will be adding two such amusements: Geyes and a little fish 
called Wanda.
At first glance, Wanda does little more than bat her tail around and 
spurt out a bubble or two. However, if you click on her, a window pops up in 
which Wanda will spew out quotes and offbeat one-liners. 
To get a glimpse of Wanda in action, limited though that action may 
be, the steps are essentially the same as those in Project 3A-1 on page 33, 
but I’ll run through them one more time:
1.
Right-click any open space on the top panel.
2.
From the popup menu, select Add to Panel, after which the Add to Panel 
window will appear.
3.
In that window, click Fish once to highlight it, click the Add button, and 
then click Close.

A New Place to Call Home
35
Wanda will now appear on your panel, so go ahead and give her a click 
to see what she has to say.
Now you can add Geyes, which is a pair of eyes that follows your mouse 
cursor around as it moves about your desktop. Follow the same procedure, 
but click Geyes instead of Fish in step 3.
3A-3: Adding a Program Launcher to the Panel
Now let’s move on to something a bit more practical—adding program 
launchers to the panel. While it is very easy to run an application by navigating 
through the Application menu, there are no doubt some applications that you 
will be using frequently enough to want easy access to them. OpenOffice.org 
Writer is probably one of those.
Method 1
There are a number of different ways to add a launcher to the panel, but let’s 
start with the most conventional. To add a panel launcher for OpenOffice.org 
Writer, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click any open space within the top panel.
2.
Select Add to Panel in the popup menu to bring up the Add to Panel 
window.
3.
In that window, click the Application Launcher button.
4.
A new screen will then appear, showing the contents of the Application 
menu (Figure 3-6). Click the small arrow next to Office to expand that 
menu, and then scroll down and click OpenOffice.org Word Processor 
to highlight it.
5.
Click the Add button, and then click Close to complete the process.
Figure 3-6: Adding an application launcher to the GNOME Panel

36
Chapter 3
Method 2
There is another way to add program launchers to the panel, and it is actually 
a tad quicker. As an example, we’ll add a launcher for the OpenOffice.org 
spreadsheet program, Calc. Here are the steps:
1.
Go to the Applications menu, and navigate your way to (but do not click) 
Office OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet.
2.
With your cursor over OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet, right-click. 
3.
In the popup menu that then appears, select (that’s the usual ol’ left- 
click this time) Add this launcher to panel (Figure 3-7). The Calc launcher 
will then appear in the panel.
Figure 3-7: Another way to add application launchers to 
the panel
Method 3
Now that you’ve learned two ways to add application launchers to the panel, 
I might as well let you in on a third, even easier method. Just open a menu, 
select the item you want to add to the panel, and then drag it there. Well, it 
can’t get much easier than that, eh?
3A-4: Changing Panel Launcher Icons
With your two new program launchers now added to the panel, you may come 
to feel that it is rather difficult to distinguish one from the other. Fortunately, 
you can change the icon for any launcher quite easily. To learn how to do it, 
let’s address our immediate concerns with the two OpenOffice.org launchers. 
Here’s what we need to do:
1.
Right-click the first program launcher you added (Writer), and select 
Properties from the popup menu.
2.
In the Launcher Properties window, click the OpenOffice.org icon, 
which will bring up a Browse Icons window.
3.
In that window, scroll down until you find openofficeorg-20-writer.png,
and then click it once (Figure 3-8).

A New Place to Call Home
37
Figure 3-8: Selecting a new panel launcher icon
4.
Click the OK button in that window, which will close it. 
5.
You will then be back at the Launcher Properties window, which should 
now look like that in Figure 3-9. If so, click Close.
Figure 3-9: A Launcher Properties window
Once you have completed the transformation, follow essentially the 
same steps for the Calc launcher, but this time around you should select 
openofficeorg-20-calc.png as the icon in step 3.
3A-5: Adding a Drawer to the Panel
One of the features I quite like about the GNOME Panel is the drawer. The 
drawer is a little drop-down panel that acts as the perfect location to place 
launchers that you do not want to place in your GNOME Panel because 

38
Chapter 3
of space considerations. This is also a handy location to place launchers 
for applications that you must normally run by typing a command in a 
Terminal window or via the Launch Application window, such as those you 
compile yourself from source code or that are run via scripts. You’ll learn 
how to do this in Chapter 9. Of course, you can put anything you want 
there, including frequently used files. 
Adding a drawer to your panel is very easy, and is basically the same 
procedure that you used to add the Force Kill button to the panel. Here is 
all you need to do:
1.
Right-click any open space on the top panel.
2.
From the popup menu, select Add to Panel, after which the Add to Panel 
window will appear.
3.
In that window, click Drawer once to highlight it, and then click the 
Add button. Close the window by, quite logically, clicking Close.
3A-6: Adding Program Launchers to the Drawer
The drawer you’ve just added is, of course, empty at this stage, so let’s put it 
to good use by adding launchers for three useful, yet less glamorous, system 
utilities. These are System Monitor, which allows you to view your computer’s 
running applications and processes, memory and CPU usage, and storage 
device usage; Terminal, in which you can type and execute commands 
(slightly geeky, I admit, but very useful); and Synaptic Package Manager, 
which you can use to download and install applications. 
Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Right-click the drawer applet in the panel, and select Add to Drawer in 
the popup menu.
2.
In the Add to Drawer window that then appears (and looks and behaves 
exactly the same as the Add to Panel window), click the Application 
Launcher button. 
3.
In the next screen, click the small arrow next to Administration, scroll 
down and click Synaptic Package Manager to select it, and then click
Add. The Synaptic Package Manager launcher will now be loaded into 
the drawer.
4.
Add a launcher for the System Monitor by scrolling down a bit, clicking 
System Monitor, and then clicking Add.
5.
Scroll back up to the Accessories category, and click the small arrow 
next to it.
6.
Scroll down to Terminal, click it, and then click the Add button. You can 
now close the Add to Drawer window.
The three launchers should now be loaded in the drawer, so click the 
drawer to sneak a peek. Yours should look the same as mine in Figure 3-10.

A New Place to Call Home
39
Figure 3-10: Launchers in 
a GNOME Panel drawer
3A-7: Adding the Entire Contents of a Menu to the Panel
If you find that you use the applications in a particular submenu of your 
Applications, Places, or System menus a lot, you can opt to add the entire 
menu to the panel as either a menu or as a drawer in a manner similar to 
the one you used in Project 3A-3’s “Method 2” on page 36. To learn how 
to do this, let’s add the Games submenu to the panel as a menu, and the 
Sound & Video submenu as a drawer. Here is what you need to do:
1.
Add the Games menu to the panel by going to Applications Games and 
then right-clicking any of the launchers within that submenu.
2.
In the popup menu that appears, select Entire Menu Add this as menu 
to panel.
3.
Add the Sound & Video submenu to the panel as a drawer by going 
to Applications Sound & Video and then right-clicking any of the 
launchers you find there.
4.
In the popup menu, select Entire Menu Add this as drawer to panel.
You should now have two new launchers on your panel with icons 
matching those found in the Applications menu next to the relevant items. 
Click each of these new panel entries to see how they work.
3A-8: Moving Things Around on the Panel
Well, now we’ve added all we are going to be adding to the panel. It may 
seem a little messy up there right now, so let’s do a bit of housekeeping by 
moving things around. We will try to group things together somewhat 
thematically so as to make them easier to deal with. 
Fortunately, you can move panel launchers quite easily by right-clicking 
the launcher in question, selecting Move from the popup menu, and then 
dragging the launcher to the spot you want to place it. Once the launcher is 
where you want it to be, click the launcher once, and it will stay there.
To get some practice with this moving business, let’s move the launchers, 
menus, and drawers you added by placing them in the following order, from 
left to right: Applications, Places, System, Firefox, Mail, OpenOffice.org 
Writer, OpenOffice.org Calc, Sound & Video, Games, Drawer. Place the 

40
Chapter 3
remaining launchers at the right end of the panel, to the left of the update 
notification tool, in the following left-to-right order: Geyes, Wanda, Force 
Quit. Finally, place the Run Application panel applet by itself, midway 
between the two clusters of launchers.
When you’ve made all your changes, your panel should look pretty much 
like mine in Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-11: The GNOME Panel with the new launchers
More Panel Fun
In addition to the basic customization you did in Project 3A on page 33, you 
can do a lot more to change the look and feel of your panel. Of course, 
you can remove any of your launchers, drawers, or menus by right-clicking 
the item in question and then selecting Remove From Panel in the popup 
menu, but there are still more options. Most of these are available by right-
clicking any open space in the panel and then selecting Properties, which 
will bring up the Panel Properties window.
From this window you can change the position of the panel, alter its 
size, change its color, or make it transparent—very cool. You can also set the 
panel so that it will automatically disappear when you are not using it and 
have it reappear when you bring your mouse cursor into the area where the 
panel normally resides. Don’t feel afraid to play around and give things a 
try—that’s half the fun!
Now that you have learned about some of the cool and useful things you 
can do with your panel, let’s now move on to the topic of menus. A very 
nice feature of GNOME is that it allows you to edit its menus. You can add 
launchers, remove items, move items, and even change the icons that 
appear within the menus. All in all, you have a lot of control over things, 
but for this project, we’ll limit our work to two of these areas: changing 
icons and moving menu items.
3B-1: Changing Icons Within Menus
As you no doubt recall, one of the problems with the OpenOffice.org Writer 
and Calc launchers we added to the panel was that they shared rather similar 
icons. If you go to Applications Office, you will see that the icons for the 
various OpenOffice.org modules, although not the same, are a bit similar. 
Project 3B: Manipulating Menus

A New Place to Call Home
41
One might also argue that those icons are also rather frumpy, which may 
violate your personal sense of aesthetics as much as it does mine. To remedy 
this state of affairs, just follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the Applications menu, and select Edit Menus (or select 
Applications Accessories Alacarte Menu Editor).
2.
In the Alacarte Menu Editor window that then appears, click Office in the 
left pane. The contents of that menu will then appear in the right pane.
3.
In the right pane of the window, right-click OpenOffice.org Word Pro-
cessor, and then select Properties in the popup menu. An Entry Editor 
window will then appear.
4.
In that window, click the Icon button, and navigate to /usr/share/
icons/hicolor/48x48/apps in the Icon Selector window that then 
appears. 
5.
To make it easier on yourself when adding icons for the other Open-
Office.org modules, drag the apps button at the top of the Browse 
window to the left pane of the same window (Figure 3-12). From now on, 
you will be able to navigate directly to this folder by double-clicking that 
icon in the left pane.
Figure 3-12: Adding a folder to your list of places
6.
Scroll down to and click openoffice.org-20-writer.png, and then 
click Open.
7.
The new icon should now appear in the Entry Editor window. If so, 
click Close, and you will be able to see the change in the Alacarte Menu 
Editor window.

42
Chapter 3
8.
Repeat the process for each of the other OpenOffice.org icons, being 
sure to select the appropriate icons for each of the OpenOffice.org 
modules (openoffice.org-20-math for the Formula module, for example). 
Once you’re done, leave the Alacarte Menu Editor window open to con-
tinue work on Project 3B-2.
NOTE
There is no alternative icon for OpenOffice.org From Template, so you can skip 
that particular item. 
3B-2: Changing the Order of Icons Within Menus
While we still have everything open to the Office menu, let’s deal with what I 
consider to be another problem: the order of the items in the menu. While it 
is natural enough to have the email client Evolution at the top of the menu, 
it doesn’t make sense to have what is arguably the most commonly used 
OpenOffice.org module, Writer, way down there at the bottom of the menu.
Remedying this situation is easy. Just click the OpenOffice.org Word 
Processor icon in the right pane of the Alacarte Menu Editor window. 
Then click the up arrow on the right side of the window as many times as 
necessary until the Writer icon is right above the OpenOffice.org Database 
icon. Once you’re done, your Menu Editor window should look something 
like mine in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13: Managing menus with the Alacarte Menu Editor
Virtual Desktops
It is now time to discuss a rather unique and convenient feature of Linux: 
virtual desktops. Rather than listen to me babble on and on about this virtual 
desktop business, it is probably best to learn by just giving it a try. 

A New Place to Call Home
43
In your GNOME Panel, click the Wanda, OpenOffice.org Writer, and 
Firefox launchers. You will then have three windows open in your present 
desktop, or workspace. Now look at the Workspace Switcher to the right of 
the bottom panel. There should be four boxes, with the one on the left, your 
present workspace, in brown. Click one of the other grayed-out boxes, and 
all your open windows will suddenly disappear.
Actually, nothing has really disappeared—you are just viewing a new desk-
top. All your other windows are still open and running in the previous desktop. 
In this second desktop you can open something else: Go to the Applications
menu, and select Games AisleRiot Solitaire. The AisleRiot Solitaire card 
game will soon appear. 
You now have windows open in two different desktops, and you can switch 
back and forth between them. To do so, just go to the Workspace Switcher in 
your panel and click the first grayed box, which will take you to your original 
desktop. Once you’ve done that, the box for the workspace you were just in will 
gray, and you can then click that one to go back to your game desktop.
As you can imagine, this feature has some potential benefits for you, in 
addition to helping you avoid clutter. Just imagine that you are at work typing 
some long document in OpenOffice.org Writer. Eventually, you get tired and 
decide to goof off a bit by playing a game, such as Mines, for a while. To do 
this, you switch to another desktop where you open and play the game. A bit 
later, when you notice your boss making the rounds of the office, you simply 
switch back to the first desktop so that you look busy when he walks by and 
asks, “Keeping yourself busy, Boaz?” 
Phew!
By the way, you can also switch between virtual desktops by simulta-
neously pressing and holding CTRL-ALT and then pressing your left and right 
cursor keys to move to your targeted desktop.
Moving Running Applications Between Virtual Desktops
So what happens if, let’s say, you are running OpenOffice.org Writer in one 
workspace and the GIMP in another, but suddenly think that it would be 
handy to have them both running in the same workspace? Do you quit the 
GIMP and start it up again in the other desktop? Fortunately, things are 
much simpler than that, and there are actually two ways to get the job done.
The first of these ways is to right-click on the title bar of the window 
you want to move, and then select Move to Workspace Left or Move to 
Workspace Right. I find it less confusing to select Move to Another Workspace, 
and then select the workspace I want to move the window to by number: 
Workspace 1, Workspace 2, and so on. 
Another way to move a window from one workspace to another is via 
the Workspace Switcher on the bottom panel. Within the four boxes of the 
Workspace Switcher, each representing a different workspace, tiny icons will 
appear for each of the windows you have open in a given workspace. The 
icons, as you can see in Figure 3-14, will even resemble the shape of the 
actual windows themselves. You can use these icons to move windows from 
one workspace to another using a basic drag-and-drop maneuver. 

44
Chapter 3
Figure 3-14: The Workspace 
Switcher shows icons of windows 
you have open in each workspace.
For example, let’s say you want to move Firefox from workspace 2 to 
workspace 1. To do this, you would simply click the tiny icon within the 
second box of the Workspace Switcher, and drag it to the first box, after 
which the icon would appear there because the Firefox window itself would 
have moved there. 
Finally, if you like to keep your hands more on your keyboard than on 
your mouse, you can also move a window from workspace to workspace by 
using hotkeys. With the window you want to move active (on top of the pile, 
so to speak), press and hold SHIFT-CTRL-ALT, and then use the left and right 
cursor keys to move the window to the desired desktop.
Wanda Revisited—GNOME Easter Eggs
Well, now that we’ve finished with our work in this chapter, it’s time to goof 
around a bit by revisiting our precocious piscean pal, Wanda. Knowing what 
you now do about Wanda the Fish, you might find it odd for me to start 
talking about her again, but Wanda has a few more tricks beneath her fins. 
In fact, she is a good means by which to introduce two of GNOME’s most 
famous Easter eggs. Easter eggs, in case you don’t know, are hidden snippets 
of code that programmers seem to love to sneak into their programs. They 
are usually pretty useless things, but they can be found in all operating 
systems, numerous applications, and even on DVDs (to find out more 
about those, go to www.dvdeastereggs.com). 
A good example of an Easter egg is my first encounter with one on my 
first Mac, an ancient Mac SE with a whopping 2MB of RAM. On that machine, 
you could bring up an image (or was it a slideshow?) of the Mac SE develop-
ment team by pressing the seldom used debug key on the side of the machine 
and then typing G 41D89A. Pretty cool, I guess, but I would never ever have 
stumbled upon it had I not read about it in some magazine. 
As my example shows, accessing these Easter eggs usually requires some 
unusual maneuvers, ones that you would never perform in the normal 
course of things. To see a Wanda-related Easter egg in action, click the Run 
Application button you just added to the panel, type gegls from outer space
in the Command box, and then click Run. You will then see an odd little 
game of the Space Invaders genre, shown in Figure 3-15, in which Wanda 
defends our beloved planet from . . . well, gegls, I guess.
To try out the other Wanda Easter egg, open the Run Application panel 
applet again, but this time type free the fish, and then click Run. Wanda will 
now appear swimming around your desktop. If you then click directly on her, 
she will swim away and out of the picture . . . but she’ll be back. 

A New Place to Call Home
45
Figure 3-15: One of GNOME’s Wanda-related Easter eggs
To put an end to Wanda’s comings and goings, you will need to restart 
the GNOME Panel. There several rather inelegant ways of going about this, 
but for now we’ll do it by opening the Run Application panel applet again, 
typing killall gnome-panel, and then clicking Run. Your panels will disappear 
for a second or two but will shortly reappear. Wanda, however, will be gone.
Shutting Down
Now that you know your desktop environment so well, you may feel like 
calling it a day and shutting down your machine. To do so, just go to the 
System menu and select Log Out. Your screen will darken, and then a small 
window (Figure 3-16) will appear with six choices to choose from: Log Out, 
Lock Screen, Switch User, Hibernate, Restart, and Shut Down (Hibernate is 
not an option when running a live session from the Desktop CD). Click Shut 
Down, and the shutdown process will begin. If, however, nothing seems to 
happen within a few seconds of clicking OK, press CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE in 
unison, which will bring you to the login screen you saw at the beginning of 
the chapter (Figure 3-1). Once there, click Shut Down at the bottom of the 
screen. This will bring up a small window asking you if you are sure you want 
to shut down. Just click OK, and shutdown will commence.

46
Chapter 3
Figure 3-16: GNOME’s logout window
The actual shutdown will take a few seconds as the system closes its 
various services. When it is all done, the system should power down your 
computer as well, in which case you are done. On a few machines, however, 
the system cannot power down your machine. You will know if this is so in 
your case because all screen activity will come to an end. If you get to that 
point and nothing else happens for 15 seconds or so, then just power down 
the machine manually by pressing the power button. It is completely safe to 
do so at that point.

The Internet, Linux Style
These days, average home computer users 
spend more time surfing the Web and writ-
ing email messages than doing just about 
anything else. Even if you’re not much of a 
surfer, there are still numerous other applications that 
aren’t really Internet applications per se but that still 
make use of the Internet in some way, such as gathering song and album 
information when you rip audio CDs to create MP3 files. Having a computer 
that isn’t hooked up to the Internet is like buying a new Maserati and then 
refusing to take it out of the garage. 
Of course, how you connect to the Internet depends on your hardware 
and provider. There are a number of possibilities in this area, including 
high-speed local area networks (LANs), cable modems, and ADSL connec-
tions from phone companies. Most computers also have an internal 56Kb/s 
modem or can be connected to external dial-up modems for slower connec-
tions over regular phone lines. Depending on what you’ve got, setting things 
up on your system should prove a cinch in the case of LAN connections and 
any others that make use of your Ethernet port (such as cable modems), 

48
Chapter 4
possibly a bit more work in the case of wireless connections, and sometimes a 
bit of a challenge when it comes to the ol’ dial-up connections. In this chapter, 
you will learn how to set up these connections and learn a bit about what 
Linux has to offer in terms of the most commonly used Internet applications—
your web browser and email client.
Setting Up a High-Speed Connection
If you have a high-speed Internet connection from your cable television com-
pany, or if you are connected to the Internet by a LAN at your office, you are 
really in luck, because these setups are probably the easiest to deal with. Most 
likely, all you have to do is connect the Ethernet cable from the wall (if you 
are using a LAN) or from your cable modem to the port of the network card 
on your machine. If you’re using a wireless router, then the Ethernet cable 
will connect to the wide area network (WAN) port of your wireless router. 
After that, once you start up your machine, you should be ready to go with-
out any further settings to fool with. 
If you have a problem getting online, and you are trying to connect to via 
a LAN or cable modem, the problem could very likely be that your network 
card is not supported by Linux. This is relatively rare, but fortunately, easily 
remedied (by replacing it). 
The problem could also be that your network or service provider does 
not automatically assign addresses via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
(DHCP). DHCP is a means by which your Internet provider can automatically 
(dynamically) provide your system with the configuration information it 
needs in order to connect to the Internet. If your provider does not utilize 
DHCP, you will have to get the necessary information about settings from the 
network administrator or service provider and enter the settings yourself.
Setting Up a Cable or Ethernet Connection for Providers Not Utilizing DHCP
To input your cable or Ethernet settings yourself, first get the settings you 
need from your network administrator or Internet provider, and then 
perform the following steps:
1.
From the System menu, select Administration Networking.
2.
You will be prompted for your password at this point, so type it (that 
would simply be your user password), and click Continue.
3.
The Network Settings window (shown in Figure 4-1) will soon appear, 
and when it does, select Ethernet connection by clicking it once, and 
then click the Properties button.
4.
In the Interface Properties window that appears, make sure the box next 
to the words Enable this connection is checked, and then change the Con-
figuration selection from DHCP to Static IP address.

The three text boxes shown in Figure 4-2 will become active, thus allow-
ing you to enter the information provided to you by your Internet pro-
vider or network administrator. Once you’ve entered the settings, click 
the OK button.
Figure 4-2: Manually inputting network 
IP settings
6.
Once you return to the Network Settings window, make sure Ethernet 
connection is still selected, and then click the Activate button. 
7.
Once the Ethernet connection item in the main pane says it is active, you 
can click the OK button and start surfing away to your heart’s content. 
NOTE
If you are wondering what Internet protocol (IP) and domain name service (DNS) are 
all about, you can simply think of them in this way: the DNS translates the easy-to-
remember URLs that you have come to know, such as www.yahoo.com, into numerical, 
or IP, addresses that the Internet can understand. The address http://www.yahoo.com 
thus becomes http://216.109.118.68. You can type the numerical version into your 
browser later to see for yourself.

Chapter 4
Setting Up a Wireless Connection
Laptops have made the computer a more versatile tool. With the right 
wireless hardware, you can now surf the Web just about anywhere you can 
catch a wave, so to speak. Whether you happen to be at your breakfast table, 
on your backyard deck, in the library of your university, or at your local 
Starbucks, Port City Java, or Dunkin’ Donuts, you can now go online without 
having to physically hook up your computer to anything. Fortunately, the 
process of setting up wireless networking in Ubuntu is quite easy—little 
different than what you just read in “Setting Up a High-Speed Connection” 
on page 48. In fact, as I just mentioned, chances are that everything will just 
work from the get-go.
Hardware
If you lead a solely wired existence or are just inexperienced in this particular 
area, there are a few things worth knowing. To get started, you need to have 
the right hardware. If you just want to go wireless outside of the home, then 
all you need is a wireless network interface card (NIC). These are often built 
in to modern laptops, while for others they are usually add-ons in the form of 
cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot on the side of your computer (as seen 
on the right of Figure 4-3). 
Figure 4-3: All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface card
There are, however, also some NICs that plug into one of your machine’s 
USB ports or, in the case of desktop models, one of its PCI slots. While support 
for NICs of this type has improved through the last couple of years, there are 
still gaps, and some can be rather tricky to deal with. If you’re looking for a 
sure thing, Centrino IPW-2100 and IPW-2200 cards are definitely supported by 
Ubuntu. As for NICs of the built-in or PC card variety, you will find support 
much better, but even then you have to make sure, or at least hope, that the 
card you are using is Linux compatible. No matter what NIC you are won-
dering about, the easiest way to find out whether or not it will work is to just 
try it out. The Linux kernel now comes with several wireless drivers built in, 
and Ubuntu updates often provide new ones, so if you use a card that is 

More Than Webbed Feet
51
compatible with one of those drivers, things will be smooth sailing. If things 
don’t seem to work, check the Ubuntu forums to find a driver that is com-
patible or to see if anyone has experience with your particular card. 
If you want to set up a wireless system in your home or office, then you 
will also need to get a wireless access point (WAP), shown on the left of Fig-
ure 4-3. Fortunately, Linux compatibility is not really much of an issue in 
this department, because the access point doesn’t physically interface with 
your computer.
Unfortunately (for Linux users, anyway), there are a few WAPs that 
require you to use Internet Explorer to handle their setup chores. Because a 
Linux version of Internet Explorer does not exist, you will find yourself stuck 
unless you have a Mac or Windows machine somewhere else in the house to 
complete the job. Worse yet is the fact that some machines do not support 
browser-based settings at all. Instead, they require you to install special 
Windows software to do the job. When selecting hardware for your wireless 
setup, it is obviously best to stay clear of WAPs of this kind.
Activating Your Wireless Card
Setting up a Linux-compatible wireless PC card is actually relatively simple. 
First connect your WAP to your Internet source, and then turn on the WAP. 
Once it is up and running, plug your wireless NIC into the PCMCIA slot on 
your laptop, unless, of course, your NIC is built in, in which case you can 
forgo this step. Any LEDs on the external card will most likely light up at 
this time. 
If your WAP was on when you booted up your computer, and your wire-
less card was in place during bootup, you probably don’t need to do anything 
else to access the Internet. Otherwise, the only thing you will really have to 
do to get your card working is to configure it and then activate it. You can do 
this by performing the following steps:
1.
Go to the System menu, and select Administration Networking. After 
typing your password when prompted to do so, the Network Settings 
window will appear. 
2.
In that window, click Wireless connection to select it, and then click the 
Properties button. 
3.
When the Interface Properties window appears, check the box next to 
the words Enable this connection. If you are in a location where more than 
one wireless signal is available, you can select the one to which you want 
to connect from the drop-down menu button next to the words Network 
name (ESSID).
NOTE
Some WAPs employ an added level of security in the form of Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) or, more recently (and more securely), a WEP key. If the WAP to which you are 
trying to connect requires such a key, you can type it in the box next to the words WEP 
key. If you don’t know the key, then chances are you are not supposed to be making 
the connection in the first place.

52
Chapter 4
4.
Go down to the Connection Settings section of that window, and select 
DHCP, since most public hotspots and home WAPs are designed to 
utilize DHCP. You can then click the OK button. 
5.
Back at the Network Settings window, click the Activate button (first 
making sure that Wireless connection is still selected). 
6.
When the Wireless Connection selection says it’s active, click the OK
button to complete the deal.
The network connection indicator at the right end of your top panel 
will now show a small green icon to its right, indicating that you now have 
a wireless connection. If you click that icon, you can see the Connection 
Properties window for that connection, which will show, among other 
things, the signal strength of your connection, as you can see in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-4: Checking the signal 
strength of a wireless connection
Releasing and Renewing Your Wireless Connection
There will be times when you want to turn your wireless card off, such as 
when you use your laptop on an airplane, or when you just want to flush the 
IP address in your network settings (release) and update the settings with 
the IP address of a new network (renew), as you might when moving your 
laptop from one wireless hotspot to another without rebooting your computer.
This last point might seem a bit mysterious to you, so I will explain things 
briefly. When you boot up your computer, your wireless card (NIC) performs 
a scan of available networks (WAPs) in order to see which one it can connect 
to. Once it finds a network, it gathers an IP address from that network via 
DHCP in order to allow you to access the Internet. Utilizing release and renew 
allows you to change WAPs without having to reboot your computer or when 
your machine, for whatever reason, just can’t seem to make the change on 
its own. 
To turn off your wireless card or release the current IP address in 
your network settings, just follow the steps you used in “Activating Your 
Wireless Card” on page 51, but this time click the Deactivate button. To 
reactivate (or renew) the connection, just click the Activate button. All 
quite simple.

A Handier Way to Release, Renew, and Even Sniff
I try not to jump ahead of myself in this book, but this is one case where it is 
warranted. (Call it a preview of coming attractions if you like.) In Chapter 5 
you will be learning how to add new software to your system via an application 
called Synaptic. One item that you as a wireless user may well find useful is a 
handy little application called WiFi Radar. WiFi Radar, shown in Figure 4-5, 
shows you what wireless networks are available to you and what the signal 
strength of each of those networks is. WiFi Radar also allows you to connect 
(or at least try to connect) to whatever networks it finds that are willing 
(knowingly or not) to have you. By using WiFi Radar’s Connect and 
Disconnect buttons, you can also release and renew your network connec-
tions in a very simple fashion. 
Figure 4-5: Checking available wireless 
signals with WiFi Radar
All in all, WiFi Radar is a very handy tool, especially when you are on the 
road trying to freeload off a signal on which to send an email—not that I am 
advocating your doing such a thing, of course. Once you learn how to install 
software in Chapter 5, you can download and install WiFi Radar by doing a 
search for wifi-radar within Synaptic and then following the instructions for 
installing any application with that application.
Setting Up a Dial-Up Connection
Although much of the world is moving to high-speed Internet connections, 
many of you may still be using dial-up Internet connections, which means 
that you need to have a traditional dial-up modem to reach beyond your box 
to the outside world. In case you broadband surf-gods have forgotten, modems 
are those wonderful machines that whistle, chime, screech, and spit whenever 
you dial up your Internet provider. I suppose you could think of them as 
noisy telephones in need of a good burp.
The good news is that setting up your dial-up connection is a simple 
process that much resembles what I’ve covered thus far for other connection 
types. Now here comes the bad news—in the world of Linux, very few internal 
modems are supported. The main reason behind this compatibility problem 

54
Chapter 4
is that most built-in modems are software dependent, and the software they 
depend on is part of, or designed for, Windows. Such modems are thus 
called Winmodems.
Of course, the Linux community has been working on ways to deal with 
these Winmodem beasts so that they will work with Linux systems. Though 
support for the wide variety of Winmodem models out there is still rather 
spotty, things are better than before, so you might just luck out. My advice 
is to hold off on the wondering and worrying and just give your modem a 
try to see if it works. If it does, then you’re all set. If it doesn’t, well, then 
you’ve got some options open to you, but at least you haven’t done any 
damage to your system. 
With all that intro-babble out of the way, let’s get down to the steps for 
setting up your dial-up connection. First, get the setting information you 
need from your Internet provider. Most providers gear their operations to 
Windows and often Mac users, and very few offer Linux support, other than 
NeanderTech and a few others. Still, there is no technical reason for your 
Linux system not to work via their setup, so just nag and push them until they 
give you the information you want. After that, make sure your modem is 
connected to a live telephone connection—for example, the phone jack in 
your wall—and then do the following:
1.
Go to the System menu, and select Administration Networking. After 
typing your password when prompted to do so, the Network Settings 
window will appear. 
2.
In that window, click Modem connection to select it, and then click the 
Properties button. 
3.
When the Interface properties window appears, check the box next to 
the words Enable this connection.
4.
In the Internet Service Provider Data section of that window, type the 
dial-up connection phone number as given by your provider, and the 
dial prefix, if necessary, to dial out of your current phone system (some 
offices require that you first dial 9, for example, to make a call out of 
the office). 
5.
Type your username and password, as given by your provider, in the 
boxes in the Account data section of the window. 
6.
Click the Modem tab, and then select either Tones or Pulses in the Dial 
Type section of the window, depending on the type of dialing scheme you 
have for your telephone service. Most are tone dialers these days, so you 
can choose that if you’re not sure. You can generally figure it out your-
self by paying attention to the sounds made when you dial a call. If you 
hear a series of different tones—almost a melody that you can recognize—
then you have tone dialing. 
7.
Select Off or On in the Volume section of that tab, depending on 
whether or not you want to hear your modem doing its dialing. While 
testing things out, it is a good idea to select On so that you can hear 
what is (or is not) happening.

More Than Webbed Feet
55
8.
In the same tab, now click the Autodetect button. The system should 
then perform a scan of your ports as it looks for a live modem. Once it 
finds one, it will specify the correct port in the box labeled Modem port.
If it doesn’t find one, well . . . that’s not a particularly good omen in 
terms of the usability of your present modem, but you can still give it a 
try by picking a port on your own. Start out with /dev/modem, and if 
that doesn’t work after going through steps 9 and 10, try out the others 
one by one before finally opting for more dramatic measures.
9.
Once your modem port has been found (or you’ve chosen one on your 
own), click the OK button.
10. Back at the Network Settings window, make sure that Modem connec-
tion is still selected, and then click the Activate button. 
Once the steps are completed and assuming your modem and system 
are in loving compatibility, you should then hear your modem begin its 
dialing, spitting, and churning sequence as it makes the connection with 
your provider. Once it does, you can go on and start your browsing, emailing, 
or whatever else it is you do online. When you are ready to end your Internet 
session, click the Deactivate button to bring it all to a close.
Of course, in the future when you wish to connect to the Internet, you 
will not have to go through all of those setup steps. All you will have to do is 
click the Activate button, which makes things all the easier.
What to Do if Your Modem Isn’t Compatible
What I’ve just described is pretty much a best-case scenario. What happens, 
however, if your modem and Ubuntu do not see eye to eye? Well, there are a 
few options. My first, more radical suggestion, is to dump those extra movie 
channels from your cable service (nothing all that great on them anyway) 
and pay for cable Internet service instead. If that is not an option, then you 
have two ways to go. One is to try to geek around with your modem to see if 
you can get it to work. This is a slightly more complicated process, but there 
are instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto. If you are 
faint of heart or a novice user, you may find what the process entails to be a 
bit more than you’re willing to deal with. 
The simpler, although costlier, way to get your modem to work is to 
change your modem. In this case, changing to a true hardware modem. 
Hardware modems, in case you are not familiar with the term, are modems 
that are not software dependent and thus work with whatever system you 
happen to use with them. You can think of them as telephones without a 
handset.
Such modems come in two forms: internal and external. As for the 
internals, the USRobotics models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem 
(internal slot) and 56 PC Card Modem (PC card slot, for laptops) are true 
hardware modems that are easily available and are said to work. You can 

56
Chapter 4
check out the USRobotics site (www.usr.com) for more information on 
these models, though checking the Ubuntu forums for suggestions is 
always a good idea.
External Dial-Up Modems
Perhaps the safest of all solutions is to buy an external serial modem. An 
external modem sits in a box outside your computer, and it connects to the 
serial port in the back of the computer, which is usually the only connector 
with little prongs in it (see Figure 4-6). Because the modem doesn’t use your 
operating system to operate, it does not tie up system resources while it’s 
busy, which may result in a possible pickup in computer speed.
Figure 4-6: Serial port and connector
Most external serial modems should work with your system, or at least 
that is what most people will tell you. If you are worried and are looking for a 
sure thing, Zoom Telephonics (www.zoom.com) makes an external serial 
modem that is compatible with Linux, and they say so right on their website. 
The USRobotics 56K V.92 External Faxmodem is also said to work, though I 
haven’t tried out this model myself. 
If you find another model that you think will do the trick, before you 
commit to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo! or Google search with 
that modem’s make and model number, along with the word linux, and see 
what search results you get. Of course, you can also try out one of the Linux 
forums and ask about the modem make and model there. There are a lot of 
people in the same boat, so you are sure to get plenty of opinions and advice.
Firefox: Your Internet Browser
Now that you are connected to the Internet, you no doubt want to get down to 
some cyberspace discovery and exploration, and the most commonly used 
means of doing that is with a web browser. The default web browser in your 
Ubuntu system is Firefox, which is enjoying increasing popularity in not only 
the Linux world, but in the Windows and Mac worlds as well. Chances are you 

More Than Webbed Feet
57
are already a Firefox user, but if you are not, then you needn’t worry—things 
work more or less the same in all browsers. That being the case, you should 
be able to use Firefox’s basic features without any instruction. Of course, 
there are some features that do distinguish Firefox from its competition, so I 
will mention those.
Controlling Browser Window Clutter with Tabs
Usually when you click a link on a web page, the new page opens in the same 
window. On some pages, links are coded so that the new page opens in a new, 
separate window, or maybe you occasionally opt for opening a link in a new 
window by right-clicking the link and then selecting the Open Link in New 
Window option. This can be very useful; however, once you have more than a 
few browser windows open, it gets sort of hard to find what you’re looking for 
in all those open windows. It can also slow things down a bit.
This is where Firefox’s tab feature comes in handy. To see how it works, 
try it out yourself right here and now. Open your Firefox browser by click-
ing the launcher on the top GNOME Panel (or going to Applications  
Internet Firefox Web Browser); then Google the word nyckelharpa using 
Firefox’s handy search box, which is next to the word Go at the top-right 
corner of the browser window (see Figure 4-7). By default, Firefox will perform 
searches for keywords entered in the search box using Google. You can, if 
you like, select other search engines by clicking the G icon in the search 
box and then making your selection. Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo! are 
available, to name a few, and you can even add others. For now, however, 
let’s stick to Google for our present search, by typing nyckelharpa in that 
search box. Once you’ve finished typing, press the ENTER key, after which a 
page of Google results should appear in the main pain of the Firefox 
window. 
NOTE
While tabbed browsing is no longer as unique as it once was (Safari has the feature 
built in, though you have to enable it yourself, and Internet Explorer now has the same 
functionality available as a downloadable add-on), it is implemented and enabled by 
default in Firefox.
Figure 4-7: Performing a Google 
search from the Firefox search box
The top result should be the American Nyckelharpa Association, and 
you are now going to open that page in a new tab, rather than in the same or 
a new window. To do that, right-click the link, and in the popup menu that 
appears, select Open Link in New Tab. You can, if you prefer, make things 
a tad easier and dispense with the popup menu selection step by simply 

58
Chapter 4
clicking the link with both mouse buttons simultaneously or by holding down 
the CTRL key as you click the link. Either way, the new page will appear in a 
new tab, while your original page of search results remains, ready and 
waiting in the other tab (see Figure 4-8). I am pretty confident in saying 
that, once you get used to this feature, you will wonder how you ever got 
along without it.
Figure 4-8: A link opened in a new tab in Firefox
Other Firefox Features: Popup Manager
Firefox has a number of other useful features. One is its Popup Manager, 
which suppresses those annoying popup windows that often appear when 
you access a new web page. You can enable or disable this feature from the 
Preferences window (Edit Preferences) by clicking the Web Features icon 
in the left pane of that window and then checking or unchecking the box 
next to the words Block Popup Windows. You can also permit certain sites to 
provide popup windows (some popups are not only useful, but necessary 
for the correct functioning of a site) by clicking the Allowed Sites button 
next to that Block Popup Windows entry and inputting the URL for the site 
in question. 
One of the coolest things about Firefox is that it allows you to further 
expand its functionality by adding various extensions. These extensions 
include all sort of things; many are quite functional, while others are just 
plain fun and goofy. They range from blog-writing tools to image viewers. 
For this project, however, we will be installing a cool weather station of sorts, 
called Forecastfox, that allows you to view not only the current weather

conditions in your area (or any other area of your choosing), but also a two-
day local forecast, Doppler radar maps, and more—all from AccuWeather.com. 
All of this is available at the click of a button from the Status or Menu bars, or 
the Bookmarks or Navigation toolbars—your choice (Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-9: The Forecastfox extension installed in Firefox
4-1: Downloading and Installing the Forecastfox Extension
To get started with the process of installing any Firefox extension, you have 
to first, quite logically, find and download one. To do this, go to the Firefox 
Tools menu, and select Extensions. The Extensions window will then appear 
(Figure 4-10), showing you the extensions you already have installed, which 
at this point should be only one. To add more, click the Get More Extensions
link at the bottom-right corner of the window, which will bring your browser 
to the Firefox Add-ons site.
Figure 4-10: Seeing what extensions you have 
and getting more in Firefox
At this point, you would normally browse for things that seem of interest 
to you, check to make sure they don’t have any special requirements (such as 
Microsoft Windows—a few do), and then download and install the extension 
that has struck your fancy. In this case, we already know what we are going to 
install, so I’ll just tell you where to find it.
To find the Forecastfox extension, first try having a look at the Top 
Downloads section of the page, as it is often there. Otherwise do a search for 
it in the search box on the Extensions page. You might also just type the URL 
where it is currently residing: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/398. Once 
you’ve found it, click the Install Now link for that item, and then wait. Some-
times the download will take a bit of time, sometimes less. Either way, just be 
patient, and don’t keep clicking the link. The extension will be in the process 
of downloading even if seems as if nothing is happening, and when it is done, 
a window will appear telling you so (Figure 4-11). 

60
Chapter 4
Figure 4-11: Firefox seeks your permission 
before installing an extension
Once the window appears, all you have to do is click the Install Now
button. The Extensions window (previously seen in Figure 4-10) will then 
pop to the front of the currently open Firefox window and indicate the 
progress of the download. When the download is done, the new extension 
will be added to the list of extensions with a message telling you that 
Forecastfox will actually be installed once you restart Firefox. The implicit 
command thus being: restart Firefox. 
4-2: Setting Up the Forecastfox Extension
When Firefox first starts up after you’ve installed the Forecastfox extension, 
you will see the Forecastfox Options window (Figure 4-12). In that window, 
type your zip or postal code (or that of any other area for which you want 
weather information) in the text box next to the word Code. If you’re not 
sure what the zip or postal code for your desired locale is, click the Find 
Code button to select that location by name. 
Figure 4-12: The Forecastfox Options window

More Than Webbed Feet

In the Forecastfox Options window, you can also choose whether you 
want the temperatures shown in Fahrenheit or Celsius and where you want 
the information to appear in your browser window. The Status bar at the 
bottom of the browser window seems to be the least intrusive location, so that 
is what I’ve chosen. Of course, you are free to place it where you like. When 
you’re done, click the Apply button and then the OK button, and you’ll be 
on your way to intense meteorological entertainment. 
Email with Evolution
Evolution is the default email program in Ubuntu, and it could probably best 
be described as a better-groomed, spunkier clone of Microsoft Outlook (see 
Figure 4-13). It allows you to send and receive mail, make appointments, and 
keep a list of tasks. It can also filter junk mail, which is a necessity these days, 
and even synchronize with your PalmPilot, if you still have one of those. Also, 
if such things are important to you, it is a much more handsome program to 
look at than Outlook.
Figure 4-13: Ubuntu’s default email client—Evolution
To use Evolution, just click the email launcher on the top panel or go to 
the Applications menu and select Internet Evolution Mail. When you first 
run Evolution, you will be greeted by a setup wizard, so have the account 
details you received from your Internet service provider handy. These should 
consist of your POP host address for receiving mail, your SMTP host address 
for sending mail, and your mail password, which is very often different from 
your Internet logon password. Your mail password is not actually entered 
during the various wizard steps, so check the Remember this password check-
box when filling in the POP details. When you first connect to your mail 
server, you will be prompted for your mail password, so you can type it at 
that time, and you won’t have to deal with it again.

Chapter 4
An Email Alternative: Thunderbird
Evolution is, without a doubt, the most popular email software in the Linux 
world, but despite its obvious attractions and popularity, I have to say that I 
don’t much like it, though I can’t quite put a finger on the reason why. I just 
prefer the more straightforward Thunderbird for my email chores. In con-
trast to the multifunctional Evolution, Thunderbird (Figure 4-14) is a more 
mail-oriented program that is very straightforward to use, yet includes most 
of the most important email functions you’ve come to expect, such as junk 
mail filters. In fact, it is remarkably similar to Outlook Express in terms of 
appearance and handling. It also lacks the quirkiness that always seems to 
squirrel its way into Evolution in some form or another. The fact that Thunder-
bird is also available in both Mac and Windows versions means that you may 
already be familiar with it, or prepared to deal with it if you find it in use on 
another system you happen to be using. 
Figure 4-14: The Thunderbird email client
Thunderbird does not come bundled with Ubuntu, so if you would like 
to try it out, you will have to download it and install it yourself. Now that you 
have set up your machine to connect to the Internet, however, you can easily 
do this after going over the contents of Chapter 5 (okay, so I’m jumping the 
gun a bit again). Just do a Synaptic search for thunderbird, and then mark 
mozilla-thunderbird for installation. Once it is installed, you can then run it 
from the Applications menu by selecting Internet Thunderbird Mail Client.
As I mentioned, both Evolution and Thunderbird are equally capable 
and possess essentially the same features in terms of mail handling. The 
difference is primarily a look-and-feel matter. Why not try both Evolution 
and Thunderbird and see which you like better?
By the way, if you find that you prefer Thunderbird to Evolution, you can 
add a panel launcher for it so as to make things easier on yourself when you 
want to run the program. Just go to Applications Internet Thunderbird 

More Than Webbed Feet
63
Mail Client, right-click that entry, and then in the popup menu that appears, 
select Add this launcher to the panel. You can then remove the Evolution 
launcher, if you are so inclined. 
Other Internet Applications
What I’ve covered thus far in terms of Internet applications is just the tip of 
the iceberg (might as well use that worn-out phrase before there aren’t any 
icebergs left, right?). Ubuntu also comes with a couple of other Internet 
applications that you might want to consider. These include the Instant 
Messenger client called Gaim (Applications Internet Gaim Internet 
Messenger), which allows you to do use any one of your MSN/Windows 
Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), ICQ, 
Gadu-Gadu, Napster, GroupWise, IRC, or Jabber accounts . . . or all of them 
simultaneously. If you want to give Internet telephony a try, Ekiga Softphone 
(Applications Internet Ekiga Softphone) also comes bundled with your 
distribution, so you need not despair.
There are still more Internet applications that you might want to con-
sider downloading and installing after you’ve completed the next chapter. 
These include the two applications I’ve already mentioned in this chapter, 
WiFi Radar and Thunderbird, but there are a host of others. If this all sounds 
pretty enticing to you, get those fingers of yours flipping and move on to the 
next chapter—the mother lode awaits!

R O U N D I N G  O U T  T H E  B I R D
Downloading, Installing, and Updating Programs the Easy Way
One of the handiest things about Ubuntu 
is that it is equipped with a very simple-to-
use application installation mechanism. The 
engine, using the term loosely, behind this is a mech-
anism called Advanced Package Tool (APT), which 
allows you to easily download, install, update, and 
remove software packaged in DEB archives, or packages.
APT is a rather foolproof way of installing programs; nothing will go 
missing, since it automatically downloads and installs any files that the main 
application you are installing requires to run. Tracking down such files, called 
dependencies, proves to be a significant headache for most Linux users. The 
painful quest of finding and then installing this file or that, as well as any 
dependencies that those files themselves might have, has led to the missing 
dependency problem being referred to as dependency hell. APT makes that 
pretty much a thing of the past. 

66
Chapter 5
The one thing about APT that some people, especially beginners, might 
consider a problem is that it is a command-driven application. This means 
that you control it via commands in a command Terminal. Fortunately, 
Ubuntu has two different graphical front ends for APT that allow you to 
bypass the command line and make everything about as easy as you could 
hope it would be. 
As I mentioned, Ubuntu comes with two graphical front ends for APT: the 
simpler, though arguably more attractive, GNOME App Install; and the main 
application handling workhorse, Synaptic. Because Synaptic is the more full-
featured of the two applications, and because GNOME App Install also utilizes 
it for its settings chores, we’ll start things off with Synaptic. 
To get a look at Synaptic, go to the System menu, and select Adminis-
tration Synaptic Package Manager. Because APT installs things in your 
system in areas that are write protected (more on that topic in Chapter 6), 
you will be prompted for your password in a separate window before Synaptic 
actually appears. The password is just your usual user password (users of 
other Linux distros take note), so that should be easy enough to remember. 
Type your password when prompted to do so, and click Continue. Synaptic, 
shown in Figure 5-1, will soon appear.
Figure 5-1: Synaptic Package Manager
Although the Synaptic interface may seem rather simple at first glance, 
it is a very powerful program. It not only allows you to search for, download, 
and install applications, but it also allows you to find and install the less glam-
orous, but equally important, libraries and support files that you might need 
for use with other applications that come bundled with Ubuntu (such as MP3 
Project 5A: Installing Applications via Synaptic

Rounding Out the Bird
67
support), or those you install by other means. You can also use Synaptic to 
find other things such as fonts, foreign language localization files, and less 
common utilities, and to update the software you have installed on your 
system when such updates are available. 
Of course, if you don’t know what you’re looking for, you can browse 
through the packages available via Synaptic by clicking the Sections button at 
the bottom-left corner of the window, selecting a category of interest in the 
pane above that, and then clicking the name of a specific package in the top-
right pane, after which a description of that package will appear in the 
pane below. 
5A-1: Adding APT Repositories via Synaptic 
It is important to know that the packages that APT (and thus both Synaptic 
and GNOME App Install) searches for, downloads, and installs are located in 
a set of specific online repositories. These repositories are basically online 
servers in which a great number of applications, support files, and more are 
stored for use with your particular system. All of the files that originally come 
bundled with your system, including the system (kernel) itself, and updates, 
when available, are stored there.
Only the main application and update repositories are activated by default 
in Ubuntu, but the real gold mine of applications is located in what are called 
the universe and multiverse repositories. These repositories contain software that 
is prepared and maintained by the Ubuntu community, but not officially 
supported by Ubuntu. In order to really make your Synaptic experience (and 
your GNOME App Install experience, for that matter) worthwhile, and to 
follow along with future projects in this book, you will, therefore, need to 
activate the universe and multiverse repositories. 
To do this, go to the Synaptic Settings menu, and select Repositories.
When the Software Preferences window appears, you will see all of the repos-
itories that are currently activated (Figure 5-2). To activate the universe and 
multiverse repositories, scroll down the list of repositories in the main pane 
(under the word Channels), and then check the boxes for all of the entries 
followed by (Binary).
After you’ve done that, click the Add button, and once the Add Channel 
window appears, check the boxes next to Community maintained (Universe) and 
Non-free (Multiverse). After that, click the Add button to save your changes 
and close the window.
Once back at the Software Preferences window, click Close. A new win-
dow will then appear telling you that you will have to click the Reload button 
in order for your changes to take effect. Click the Close button in that window, 
and then click the Reload button in the main Synaptic window as you were 
just instructed to do. 
Synaptic will then begin downloading package lists from each of the 
repositories you just added to its package database. A window like that in 
Figure 5-3 will show the progress of the download and will disappear when 

68
Chapter 5
the process is complete. There will then be a brief period during which all 
of the panes in the main Synaptic window will be gray, but don’t worry; this 
is only temporary.
Figure 5-2: Synaptic’s repository list
NOTE
Because the contents of the various repositories change quite often, it is advisable to 
reload the repository lists by clicking the Reload button every time you take Synaptic out 
for a spin. 
Figure 5-3: Download progress indicator in Synaptic
Adding New Repositories to Synaptic
You don’t need to do it right now, and you may, in fact, never have to at all, 
but it is worth knowing that you can add new repositories to Synaptic. In 
fact, you will learn how to add one later in Chapter 9, but just for future 
reference, I will lay out the process here. It is basically the same as that for 
adding the universe and multiverse repositories, albeit it with a little twist.
To add a repository, just follow these steps: 
1.
Go to the Synaptic Settings menu, and select Repositories.
2.
In the Software Preferences window that then appears, click the Add
button.
3.
In the Add Channel window that then appears, click the Custom button.

4.
Yet another window will then appear. In the text box in that window, 
enter the APT line for the repository you want to add. For example, take 
a look at the following APT line for Wine, which you’ll learn about in 
Chapter 9 (you can add the line at that time, if you’re interested). 
deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main
5.
Once you’re done, click the Add Channel button in that window. The 
window will disappear, and the new repository will appear checked in 
the Software Preferences list.
The new repository, just like the universe and multiverse repositories, can 
be deactivated by simply unchecking the box below its entry in the Software 
Preferences window.
5A-2: Installing Monkey Bubble
Let’s start using Synaptic by installing a game called Monkey Bubble just to 
see how things work. What you will be doing is basically the standard method 
you would use to search for and install any package via Synaptic, so it is a 
process well worth remembering. Here are the steps:
1.
In the main Synaptic window, click the Search button.
2.
A Find window will appear. Be sure to select Description and Name in 
the Look In menu (to provide a more forgiving search), type monkey in the 
Search box, and then click the Search button.
3.
After a short period of time, a list of results will appear in the upper-right 
pane. Look for monkey-bubble, and click it once to select it. A description 
of that file will then appear in the bottom-right pane.
4.
Right-click that same entry, and select Mark for Installation in the popup 
menu that appears. 
5.
A window like the one in Figure 5-4 will open, telling you what is going 
to be installed. The libraries you will find there are the dependencies 
required for Monkey Bubble to run. Click Mark in that window. 
Figure 5-4: Synaptic lets you know what 
additional packages will be installed

70
Chapter 5
6.
You are now ready to roll, so just click the Apply button in the main Syn-
aptic window, after which yet another window (Summary) will appear, 
telling you what is going to be installed, what is going to be changed, and 
what is going to be left alone. 
7.
Click Apply in that Summary window, after which Synaptic will begin 
the installation process, showing you its progress in a separate window 
(very much like the progress window you saw in Figure 5-3, in fact). 
8.
When the installation is complete, a new window like that in Figure 5-5 
will appear to let you know. Click Close in that final window, and then wait 
until Synaptic snaps out of its temporary state of grayness, which signals 
the complete end of the installation process.
Figure 5-5: Synaptic lets you know when it’s done doing 
its thing.
You can now run Monkey Bubble (Figure 5-6) by going to the Applications
menu and selecting Games Monkey Bubble.

Installing the Flash Player Plugin for Firefox
To get a little more practice, let’s use Synaptic to install the Flash Player 
plugin for Firefox. Given the fact that more and more web pages out there 
contain significant amounts of Flash content, this installation will make your 
web surfing endeavors much . . . well, let’s just say less annoying, since you 
won’t have to repeatedly stare at messages such as “Additional plugins are 
required to display all the media on this page” or “Click here to download 
plugin” (an especially annoying message, since the click-to-install approach 
doesn’t seem to work—not yet anyway). 
To do the deed, click the Search button in the main Synaptic window, 
type flash in the small Find window that then appears, and then click Search
in that window. In the list of results that then appears, scroll down until you 
find libflash-mozplugin, and click it once to select it. Once you’ve done that, 
right-click that same entry, and select Mark for Installation in the popup 
menu that appears. Click Mark in the window that appears, click the Apply
button in the main Synaptic window, and then click Apply again in the 
Summary window that appears. 
When the installation is done, you can check things out to make sure that 
Flash is at work by opening Firefox (and, yes, you must restart it if it was open 
while you were installing the Flash plugin) and going to www.adobe.com/
products/flash/about. If you don’t see any of the annoying you-need-this-
click-here-to-install-that messages that I mentioned earlier, you can sit back 
and smile. Success has once again come your way. Hoola.
Removing Applications via Synaptic
To remove applications installed from a DEB package via Synaptic, GNOME 
App Install, or any other means, search for the application you wish to 
remove either by clicking the Search button and typing the name of the 
application you wish to remove, or by clicking the Status button in the bottom-
left corner of the Synaptic window, clicking Installed in the pane above that, 
and then scrolling through the list of installed packages that then appears in 
the top-right pane. Once you find the application in that list, right-click on its 
name, and select Mark for Complete Removal to remove the application and 
any setting or configuration files for that application. When the window that 
tells you what is going to be axed appears, check through it carefully so as to 
make sure you aren’t inadvertently uninstalling something you would mourn 
the loss of—like your whole desktop environment, for instance. Assuming 
everything looks okay, click the Apply button, after which the process will 
be the same as that for installing applications. 
Upgrading Applications via Synaptic
As I mentioned, you can also use Synaptic to upgrade applications installed 
in your system. To do this, click the Status button in the bottom-right corner 
of the Synaptic window. In the pane above that button, then click the entry 
Installed (Upgradeable), after which a list of the installed applications with 

72
Chapter 5
available upgrades will appear in the upper-right pane. Right-click on any 
application listed there that you would like to upgrade, and select Mark for 
Upgrade in the popup menu that then appears. Repeat the right-click 
procedure for any other application you want to upgrade, then click the 
Apply button. The procedure from then on out will be the same as that for 
installing packages.
While Synaptic is great for just about everything, when it comes to browsing 
to see what cool or handy applications are available for you, Ubuntu’s other 
APT front end, GNOME App Install, is probably a more satisfying way of 
going about things, due to its graphical nature. 
To get a feel for that application, make sure Synaptic is closed (you can’t 
run Syanptic and GNOME App Install at the same time), and then open 
GNOME App Install by going to the Applications menu and selecting Add/
Remove. The Add/Remove Applications window, shown in Figure 5-7, will 
then appear.
Figure 5-7: GNOME App Install
As you can see, items in GNOME App Install are categorized pretty much 
in the same manner as in the Ubuntu Applications menu itself. If you click 
any of the category icons in the left pane of the window, you will see a list of 
all the items available for that category in the top-right pane—installed items 
are checked, while those that are not installed are unchecked. Not surprisingly, 
you will find that the checked items within each category mirror those in the 
relevant submenu of the Applications menu.

73
5B-1: Selecting Applications for Installation 
GNOME App Install, like Synaptic, can install multiple applications simultane-
ously, so to give it a whirl, we’ll try installing a couple of applications that might 
be of interest to you. Before getting down to selecting the applications, how-
ever, be sure to check the two boxes located between the top- and bottom-right 
panels: the one next to the words Show unsupported applications and the one 
next to the words Show proprietary applications. Doing this will enable you to 
view everything that is available to you in the repositories you activated via 
Synaptic in Project 5A on page 66.
Now that all that there is to be seen can indeed be seen, let’s start out by 
selecting the very cool and decidedly useful address book application called 
Rubrica (shown in Figure 5-8). To select Rubrica, just click the Office category 
in the left pane of the Add/Remove Applications window, scroll down the list 
of available applications in the top-right pane, and check the box next to the 
words Rubrica Addressbook.
Figure 5-8: Rubrica—a very cool address book
Let’s also select a handy audio application called SoundConverter that 
converts audio files from one format to another—MP3 to Ogg Vorbis, for 
example (you’ll learn more about SoundConverter in Chapter 16). To select 
it for installation, click the Sound & Video category in the left pane of the 
window, scroll down in the top-right pane, and check the box next to the 
word SoundConverter.
NOTE
Be careful not to uncheck the boxes next to any of the already checked applications 
listed in GNOME App Install. Doing so will result in their being removed once you go on 
to Project 5B-2 on page 74.

74
Chapter 5
5B-2: Downloading and Installing Selected Applications
Once you’ve made your selections, click the OK button at the bottom of 
the Add/Remove Applications window. A new window, like that in Figure 5-9, 
will appear showing what you are about to install. Click Apply in that win-
dow, after which you will be prompted for your password, just as you were for 
Synaptic (and for the same reasons), so type your user password, and click 
Continue. GNOME App Install (APT, actually) will then begin the download 
and installation process, showing its progress via the same progress windows 
you saw when installing applications with Synaptic. 
Figure 5-9: GNOME App Install tells you what it is 
about to install.
When it’s done, GNOME App Install will close itself down, and you’ll be 
ready to run your new applications. You can run the applications by going to 
the Applications menu and then looking in the submenu that matches the 
category in which each application was located within GNOME App Install. 
That would be Office for Rubrica, and Sound & Video for SoundConverter, 
which you’ll learn more about in Chapter 16.
As you can see, installing applications via GNOME App Install is quite 
simple, and if you paid heed to my warning, you also know how easy it is to 
uninstall applications. Just check, and click Apply to install; uncheck, and 
click Apply to remove. Can’t get much easier than that, you have to admit.
Performing System Upgrades via the System Update 
Panel Applet
At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned that there were two graphical 
front ends for APT, but I must now admit that I understated things a bit—
there are actually three, though that third front end is strictly used for 

Rounding Out the Bird
75
updating your system. Before updating individual packages via Synaptic, 
therefore, it is probably a good idea to save yourself some time by first 
checking for available updates via the System Update panel applet. 
To perform the update, make sure that Synaptic and GNOME App Install 
are both closed (you just can’t run two APT front ends at the same time, as I 
told you), click the System Update panel applet, type your password when 
prompted for it, and press the Continue button. A Software Updates window 
(Figure 5-10) will then appear.
Figure 5-10: Upgrading packages en masse via 
the System Update panel applet
In that window, a list of all of the available updates will appear. You can 
scroll through that list and uncheck the box for any application you don’t 
want to upgrade, but if you don’t really know what you’re doing, you had 
better just leave it as is. Either way, once you’re ready, click the Install 
Updates button, after which the updates will be downloaded and installed, 
with the same windows you saw in Synaptic and GNOME App Install showing 
you the progress of the process. Once the installation is complete, you will be 
notified in a separate window. Click Close in that window, and then do the 
same in the Software Updates window. Depending on what you installed, 
another small window may appear telling you that you will have to restart 
your system in order for changes to take effect. If so, it is best to be obedient 
and reboot.

File and Disk Handling in Ubuntu
No matter which operating system you are 
using, you have to deal with files. Some 
people are very organized, placing every file 
in a logically named folder as soon as that file is saved 
for the very first time. Then there are people like me, 
who save everything to the desktop until it is so full of junk that they can no 
longer make out the wallpaper, and only at that point do they start organizing 
in earnest (if placing all of those files in a single folder called March17Cleanup 
can be called organizing). Ah.
Of course, files not only get stored on your hard disk, but they are also 
copied to and from CDs, DVDs, external hard disks, flash drives, and other 
storage media and devices. They are also often saved in archives, which are 
then compressed to reduce their spatial footprint, making them easier to 
send via email or to fit onto spatially challenged removable storage media.
With that intro, you may have already guessed that in this chapter I will 
be dealing with file handling in Ubuntu, particularly in relation to the Nautilus 
File Manager, which is at the heart of GNOME’s file-handling capabilities.

Chapter 6
Nautilus: Your File Manager
As I mentioned, the program that creates the file viewing and organizing 
interface in your system is called Nautilus, and it comes as part of the 
GNOME desktop environment. You may not have thought of an operating 
system’s file manager as a program before, but in fact, that is what it is. 
(The Windows file manager is called Windows Explorer.) To have a look 
at Nautilus, just go to the Places menu, and select Home Folder.
When Nautilus opens up to your home folder, you should find nothing 
the first time out other than a folder titled Desktop (shown in Figure 6-1), 
which, if double-clicked, will show everything you have stored there (a lot in 
my case; most likely nothing in yours). There is also another folder, called 
Examples, which is the same as the one that appears on the Desktop when 
running Ubuntu off the live CD. It contains sample files that give you an idea 
of what Ubuntu has in store for you, along with that Nelson Mandela video 
I mentioned in Chapter 3.
You can create additional folders and, of course, files to your heart’s con-
tent, so this rather spartan state of affairs is sure to change once you get down 
to really using your system. In fact, you will be creating a number of folders 
in Chapter 7, which will make everything look a bit more lived in.
Figure 6-1: The contents of your home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window
The Side Pane
Nautilus has a lot of interesting features that deserve mention, and the most 
obvious of these is the side pane, which appears at the left side of the window. 
The side pane allows you to view a variety of information via selectable views. 
You can make your choices by clicking the drop-down menu at the top of the 
side pane (Figure 6-2). 

A Tidy Nest
79
Figure 6-2: Selecting views 
for the Nautilus side pane
The default view in Ubuntu is Places, which is a sort of quick navigation 
tool. In Places you will find icons representing various data-storage locations 
available to your system, such as your home folder, desktop, full filesystem, any 
network shares you are connected to (more on that in a moment), and any 
removal storage media or devices you have in or connected to your system. 
Double-clicking any of these icons will show the contents of that location in 
the right panel of the Nautilus window.
There are, of course, other views, such as Tree, which provides you with 
an expandable hierarchal view of your filesystem, and History, which shows 
you where in your filesystem you have been most recently, much in the way 
the history function works in a web browser. There are still other views for 
you to choose from, a couple of which you will work with in Chapter 7. 
Now You See It; Now You Don’t
The side pane is a rather handy feature, but there may well be times when 
you would prefer to have more space to view the contents of your window 
and thus want to get rid of the pane temporarily. You can do this quite easily 
by going to the View menu of a Nautilus window and then deselecting Side 
Pane. The check mark next to that entry will then disappear, as will the side 
pane. To get it back, just return to the View menu, and select Side Pane
again. The check mark will then reappear, as will the side pane itself.
There is another way to hide the side pane that many people seem to 
stumble upon accidentally, usually resulting in a bit of unnecessary panic. 
If you look at the gray border at the right side of the side pane, you will notice 
that there is a small ribbed section in the center (see Figure 6-3). Clicking that 
ribbed section acts as a toggle to hide or show the side pane. The panic most 
users suffer is a result of the fact that when the side pane is hidden in this 
way, the Side Pane entry in the View menu is still checked, indicating the 
side pane is still in view, though your eyes tell you differently. 
So there it is—the side pane’s little secret. No, it’s not a particularly 
interesting secret, but one that should not only provide you with an added 
layer of convenience, but also some peace of mind.

File Handling in Nautilus
Since Nautilus is primarily a file manager, it only makes sense to get down to 
the business of using it at that level. Of course, most folks who use computers 
today are already familiar with the basics of drag-and-drop and a few other 
means of creating folders and copying, cutting, and moving files. But for those 
who are unfamiliar with one way or another of performing these essential 
procedures, I thought it best to spell it all out. If you find this all a bit redun-
dant, please bear with me for the good of the masses.
Creating, Naming, and Renaming Folders
Creating a folder is a simple enough task, and there are two ways of going 
about it. The easiest (in my opinion) is to right-click any empty space within a 
Nautilus window, and select Create Folder in the popup menu that appears. 
If you prefer using menus to right-clicking empty space, you can instead start 
things rolling by going to the Nautilus File menu, and selecting Create Folder.
Regardless of where you made your Create Folder selection, a new folder 
with the name untitled folder will appear in the Nautilus window. The name 
box of the folder will be highlighted and surrounded with a black box, which 
means that you can immediately give that folder a name by simply typing 
one—nothing to click or do other than that. Press ENTER or click any open 
space in the Nautilus window to complete the job.
If you later decide that the name you gave your folder needs some tweak-
ing or even a complete revision, you can rename it by right-clicking it and 
selecting Rename in the popup menu. Alternatively, you can click the folder 
once to highlight it, and then select Edit Rename. After that, you can type 
the new name for the folder and then press ENTER or click any open space 
in the Nautilus window to seal the deal.

Moving Files and Folders
Perhaps the easiest of all file manipulations you can perform in Nautilus is 
moving a file by means of drag-and-drop. I am pretty sure that anybody who 
has wielded a mouse is familiar with that particular move. There is another 
way of moving files and folders, however: cut and paste. 
The easiest way of doing this is to right-click the file (or folder) you want 
to move, and then select Cut from the popup menu (Edit Cut will also do 
the trick). At this point, it will seem as if nothing has happened, as the file 
will still be there, so don’t worry. After that, right-click any open space in the 
folder to which you wish to move the file, and then select Paste in the popup 
menu. The file will then disappear from its original location and appear in its 
new one. 
Can you use key combinations to do this, you ask? Sure. Simply follow 
the directions I just gave, but use CTRL-X to cut and CTRL-V to paste. 
Copying Files and Folders
Based on the instructions I just gave, you can pretty well imagine the methods 
for copying files and folders, as they are essentially a variation on the same 
theme. Just right-click the file you want to copy, select Copy from the popup 
menu, right-click any open space within the target location, and then select 
Paste. Keystroke-wise, that would be CTRL-C to copy and, as before, CTRL-V 
to paste.
It is also possible to copy folders and files via the wonders of drag-and-
drop, though this involves more hands than required for a simple drag-and-
drop move; fortunately, the two you have will do nicely. Just press and hold 
the CTRL key while you drag the file or folder you want to copy to the target 
location. Be sure to release the mouse button and then the CTRL key (releasing 
in the opposite order will not work), and you will find a copy of the file in its 
new location.
Navigating in Nautilus
Navigating through your various folders and subfolders in Nautilus is quite 
straightforward. In fact, all is conceptually pretty much the same as what you 
are accustomed to in Windows and Mac OS. You can simply move into and 
out of folders through a combination of double-clicking folders and clicking 
the Back, Forward, and Up buttons.
Tabbed Browsing in Nautilus
In addition to the hierarchal view option provided in the side pane, there is 
another handy feature that can make your navigation chores even easier: 
Nautilus’s tabbed browsing feature. These tabs (they look like buttons, actually) 
appear in the navigation bar for each folder you opened on the way to the 
one you are currently viewing. 

82
Chapter 6
Say, for example, that you have a folder called gooseberries inside a 
folder called Dalarna inside a folder called SwedeStuff inside a folder called 
NordicStuff, which itself is in your home folder. As you click your way to that 
gooseberries folder, starting with a double-click on the NordicStuff folder, 
Nautilus will display a tab for that folder . . . and any folder opened before it. 
Take a look at Figure 6-4 to see what I mean.
Figure 6-4: Tabbed navigation in Nautilus
As you can see, there is a tab button for each of the folders within the path 
from your home folder (mine, in this case) to your target: gooseberries. So 
what, right? Well, say you want to go back to the NordicStuff folder to open a 
file in which there’s some text that you want to copy and then paste into a 
doc within the gooseberries folder. Sounds like a minor pain, right? 
Well, rather than goof around with the Back button, you can instead 
simply click the NordicStuff tab button, and the contents of that folder will be 
there before you. Need to go back to gooseberries? Just click the gooseberries 
tab button. Back to SwedeStuff, you say? Just click the SwedeStuff tab button. 
All quite fantastisk!
Spelling It Out—Typing File Paths in Nautilus
If you prefer typing to clicking, you will be happy to know that you can navi-
gate to a folder by typing its path. Just go to the Go menu, and select Location,
or keyboard shortcut lovers can just press CTRL-L. A search box will then 
appear in the location bar (Figure 6-5), in which you can type the path to 
your target folder, and then press ENTER. In the case of my berried example, 
that path would be: /home/rg/NordicStuff/SwedeStuff/Dalarna/gooseberries.
Figure 6-5: Typing the path to your target folder
Bookmarks Within Nautilus
With all this clicking away to deeply buried subfolders, it is worth mentioning 
another very handy feature of Nautilus: bookmarks. Yes, Nautilus lets you 
bookmark folders to which you have navigated. While you are no doubt 
familiar with creating bookmarks for web pages that you frequent, you may 
be wondering why on earth you would want to create bookmarks within your 
filesystem. 

A Tidy Nest
83
Well, imagine that you have a folder that you need to use often, but it is 
even more buried away than my gooseberries folder in the previous section. 
Getting there would take an excessive number of mouse clicks, and all that 
clicking is bound to eventually give you a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
While that is great for your HMO, it is most decidedly not good for you. 
Instead of maiming yourself, you could click your way to that folder once, 
and then, in the Bookmarks menu of the Nautilus window, select Add 
Bookmark. After that, whenever you want to get back to that buried folder, 
you can just click the Bookmarks menu, and the folder will be right there 
waiting for you in the drop-down list. 
Another handy thing about Nautilus bookmarks is that they also appear 
in Save As dialog boxes, such as when you save an OpenOffice.org document 
or download a file via Firefox. In any Save As dialog box, just click the Save in 
folder button, and you will find your bookmarks.
Using Nautilus as a Network Browser
Another handy Nautilus feature is its ability to function as a network browser. 
You can, for example, see what networks and shares are available to you on 
your home or office network by going to the Places menu in the GNOME 
Panel and selecting Network Servers. You can do the same from within a 
Nautilus window by going to its Go menu and selecting Network. Icons for any 
networks or computers on that network would then appear in the Nautilus 
window, as you can see in the case of my own home setup in Figure 6-6. From 
that window, you can then double-click your way to a share that you have 
permission to access, such as the Shared Documents folder of a Windows 
machine or the public folders of a Mac. 
Figure 6-6: Network browsing in Nautilus
By the way, in case you are wondering what a share is, I’ll clear that up 
for you. Basically, a network share is a location on a computer, such as a folder, 
where other users on a network can access and save files. The Shared Docu-
ments folder on a Windows system is a good example. Other users on a network 
can copy files from and (usually) write files to the Shared Documents folder, 
whereas they cannot access any other part of the filesystem on that host 
machine..

84
Chapter 6
If the share you are trying to open requires a username and password, 
you will be asked for those in a new window (Figure 6-7). Note that in this 
case, the username and password you need to enter are those for the machine 
to which you are trying to connect—not the ones you’re using in Ubuntu 
(unless the usernames and/or passwords happen to be the same, of course). 
You can then copy files to and from that share as if it were a folder on your 
own hard disk.
Figure 6-7: Entering network usernames and 
passwords for the machine to which you’re trying 
to connect
In some cases, especially when trying to access shares on a Mac running 
OS X, the double-click method will not work. You will not be able to access 
any share on a particular machine, even though an icon for that machine 
appears in the Nautilus window. In such cases, double-click the icon for the 
machine you are tying to access, and then once open (to an empty window), 
go to the Go menu, and select Location. A text box will appear in the location 
bar (just like in Figure 6-5) with the location of the machine you are trying to 
access already listed. 
To that location, add a forward slash (/) followed by the username used 
on the target machine. For example, if the target machine is called cowboycats, 
and the username is mewtoyou, the location would be smb://cowboycats/
mewtoyou. You can also narrow things down to a particular folder on the 
machine, as long as you know the path to that folder, by adding to the path 
you’ve already typed, smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou/Documents, for example. 
NOTE
In case you are wondering, the smb at the head of that path means Samba, which is soft-
ware used by Unix-based systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X) in order to interact 
with Windows networks.
Once you’ve made your way to the folder you wish to browse on the 
networked machine you’ve connected to, it might be a good idea to use the 
bookmark function in Nautilus to bookmark that open share window. You 
can then easily access that share in the future by choosing the share’s name 
in the Nautilus Bookmarks menu. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself.

85
Using Nautilus as an FTP Client
Nautilus not only allows you to browse and mount shares on local networks, 
but it can also act as an FTP client, say for instance when you want to change 
the files for your website on a remote server. To do this, go to the Connect to 
Server window (File Connect to Server), and then select FTP (with login)
for Service Type. Then type the information provided by your website host, 
and click the Connect button. An FTP Network Share icon will then appear 
on the desktop and in the side pane. Double-click that icon, type your pass-
word (for that account—not the one for your Ubuntu system, unless it 
happens to be the same) when prompted to do so, and then you will be 
able to view and add to the files you have there. 
File and Folder Permissions Within Nautilus
As you make your way in the world of Ubuntu, you will find that occasionally 
you’ll come across files or folders emblazoned with emblems such as those 
shown in Figure 6-8. These emblems signify that the file or folder in question 
is in some way locked, either in terms of your being able to read it, being able 
to alter it, or both. These readability and alterability states of being are 
referred to as permissions.
Figure 6-8: Restricted permissions emblems in Nautilus
Now you may be (legitimately) wondering what the point of this 
permissions business is, so in order to help you understand, I will give you 
some examples of how it can be useful. Let’s say that you have some files that 
you don’t want your spouse or kids to see—some bad poetry or a Christmas 
shopping list, for example. By denying read permission to those files, or to a 
folder containing those files, no one would be able to sneak a peek unless 
they were savvy at changing permissions and had the permissions necessary 
to change permissions for those files or folders.
As another example, imagine you have a file that you have worked many 
hours on and have finally completed. To alleviate fears that you might acci-
dentally trash it in some way, you could deny write permissions. By doing this, 
you wouldn’t be able to do anything to that file without changing its permis-
sions. In fact, if you tried to move that file to the Trash, or even to the desktop 
or another folder, you would be greeted with a no-can-do message, such as 
the one shown in Figure 6-9. 

86
Chapter 6
Figure 6-9: Nautilus tells you when permissions 
restrict your freedom of movement.
Changing File and Folder Permissions in Nautilus
To change file or folder permissions in Nautilus, just right-click the file 
or folder in question, and then select Properties from the popup menu. 
Once the Properties window opens, click the Permissions tab, and you will 
see who the owner of the file or folder is and what you are allowed or not 
allowed to do with it (see Figure 6-10).
Figure 6-10: Changing permissions in a Nautilus 
Properties window
You might find this permissions business a bit confusing, but it is really 
quite simple to understand. As you can see in Figure 6-8, permissions can be 
granted or denied to the owner of the file or folder (you), to a specified group,
or to others (everybody else). These permissions are:
In general, you needn’t worry all that much about setting permissions 
for your own files, as you are really the only one who has access to your user 
account. One of the main exceptions to this is when you transfer files from 
Read
Permission to view the contents of a file or folder
Write
Permission to alter the contents of a file or folder
Execute
Permission to run a program or script

87
CD to your hard disk. In this case, the files will be write protected, meaning 
that you cannot alter the files until you change the permissions for them. You 
can change the permissions of such files in order to allow yourself to alter 
them by clicking the checkbox in the Owner row next to the word Write.
Once you are done, click the Close button, and you’ll be on your way.
Keeping Your Home Folder Private
Another exception to my you-don’t-need-to-worry-about-permissions claim, 
and a potentially important one at that, is the state of permissions for your 
home folder, particularly when other people have user accounts on your 
machine. In Ubuntu, when someone logs in to their own account on your 
computer, they can click their way to your user folder and view its contents. 
To remedy this situation—and thus protect the sanctity of your home 
folder, the privacy of its contents, and the peace of mind of its owner (you)—
you can change the permissions of your home folder. Here’s what you need 
to do:
1.
Open up a Nautilus window, and then double-click File System in the 
side pane. The contents of your entire hard disk will then appear in the 
right pane of the Nautilus window.
2.
Look for and then double-click the folder named home. When the con-
tents of the home folder you just clicked appear in the right pane, there 
should only be one folder there—your own home folder, which will have 
the same name as your own username. Mine, for example, is named rg. 
NOTE
The folder named home is not your home folder, but rather the folder that contains the 
home folders for each of the user accounts on your machine. 
3.
Right-click your home folder, and then select Properties in the 
popup menu.
4.
In the username Properties window (mine says rg Properties), click the 
Permissions tab.
5.
In the Permissions tab, uncheck all of the boxes except the three next 
to the word Owner. When you’re done, your window should look like 
mine in Figure 6-11. If so, click Close.
Reading Data CDs and DVDs
Dealing with data CDs and DVDs in Ubuntu is quite simple, as everything is 
automatic. To read a CD or DVD with data on it, rather than music or video, 
place the disk in your drive, and a CD or DVD icon (they look the same) will 
automatically appear on the desktop. A Nautilus window displaying the disk’s 
contents will also appear, after which you can copy files from the CD or 
DVD to your hard disk using standard drag-and-drop procedures. 
When you want to remove the CD or DVD, just close its Nautilus window, 
right-click the desktop icon for that disk, and in the popup menu, select Eject.
The disk will then be ejected automatically.

home folder for privacy
Burning Data CDs and DVDs
Burning data CDs and DVDs in GNOME is extremely easy. All you have to 
do is place a blank CD-R (CD-Recordable) or DVD (DVD-RW, DVD-R, and 
DVD-RW are all supported by Ubuntu) in your drive, making sure to select a 
media format supported by your drive, and a window will appear asking you 
what you want to do with the disk. Click the Burn Data CD button, or in the 
case of a blank DVD, the Make DVD button. Nautilus’s CD/DVD Creator 
window will then appear, which as you no doubt notice looks pretty similar to 
other Nautilus windows, save for the brown band below the location bar and 
the Write to Disc button (Figure 6-12).
Figure 6-12: A Nautilus CD/DVD Creator window with files ready to be burned to disk

A Tidy Nest
89
Once the CD/DVD Creator window is open, copying the files you want to 
burn to disk is pretty much a simple drag-and-drop maneuver. Just open a new 
Nautilus window, and drag the files you want to burn to disk from that window 
over to the CD/DVD Creator window. If you prefer to do things in a decidedly 
Windows-esque fashion, you can select the files you want to transfer to disk by 
clicking each file once, holding down the CTRL key while doing so, for multiple 
selections. If you want to select multiple consecutive files, you can click the first 
file in the group, press and hold SHIFT, and then click the last file in the group, 
automatically selecting all the files in between. Once you’ve made your selec-
tions, release the CTRL or SHIFT key, right-click any of the highlighted files, and 
select Copy in the popup menu. After that, go back to the CD/DVD Creator 
window, right-click any open space, and then select Paste in the popup menu.
It is probably worth mentioning that the files you copy to the CD/DVD 
Creator window are not actually copied. Instead, what you see in the Creator 
window are essentially aliases pointing to the original files in their original 
locations. Thus, if you move one of the files from its original location before 
burning the contents of the CD/DVD Creator window to disk, the file will 
automatically vanish from the window, and it will not be burned to disk when 
you finally get around to that step. This is not problematic, but it is some-
thing worth being aware of.
Once you have copied all of the files you want to burn to disk, click the 
Write to Disc button, after which a window (shown in Figure 6-13) will appear, 
telling you, among other things, how many megabytes of files you have selected 
to write to disk. In this window, you can give your disk a title and adjust the 
speed at which your disk will be burned (slower speed = fewer chances for 
errors), though you can just as well accept the defaults. 
Figure 6-13: Setting options before burning 
a CD or DVD
Once you are ready to burn the disk, just click the Write button, and the 
CD/DVD Creator will do its work. In some cases a warning window will appear 
telling you that some of your files may not be suitably named for Windows 
compatibility. Just click OK if you come face to face with such a window, unless 
you do intend to transfer the files to a Windows system, in which case, you 
had better go back and rename the files according to Windows naming 
conventions before you get down to the actual burning. In particular, avoid 

90
Chapter 6
special characters and diacritics (such as umlauts and accents), and do not 
use the following characters, which are reserved for Windows system 
functions: / : ? * '' < > |.
Once the burning gets under way, its progress will be shown in a new 
window, and then when the job is done, you will be asked what you would 
like to do next. Assuming you are done with your disk burning for the day, 
click Eject, and then click Close.
In case you are wondering, the disks you burn in Linux will be readable 
in other operating systems.
Dealing with CD-RW Disks
CD-RW disks are pretty much like CD-R disks except that they can be erased 
and then written to again. They are also quite a bit more expensive than CD-R 
disks and, generally, cannot handle faster burning speeds. 
Using CD-RW disks is much like working with CD-R disks. If the disk is 
blank, there is no difference in the process at all, which makes things quite 
simple. And, if the CD-RW disk already has data on it that you wish to replace 
with something else, the process is only slightly different. 
One of these differences is that Nautilus will treat your CD-RW disk as a 
regular data disk rather than a blank one. This means that when you pop 
your disk into the drive, a regular Nautilus window will automatically open, 
rather than a CD/DVD Creator window. 
To write to the disk, you will need to manually switch from the Nautilus 
window to a CD Creator window, which is easily done by selecting CD/DVD 
Creator in the Go menu of the Nautilus window opened for that disk. Once 
you’ve done this, the window will become a CD/DVD Creator window. Now 
drag the files you want to burn to CD to that window, and, once you are 
ready to burn, click the Write to Disc button. 
As is the case with regular CD-R disks or DVDs, a Write to Disc window 
will appear. When you click the Write button in that window with a used 
CD-RW disk in the drive, however, a slight difference occurs. At this point, 
a new window like that in Figure 6-14 will appear telling you that the disk 
seems to have files already written on it. Click the Erase Disc button in that 
window, and the CD/DVD Creator will erase the files already on the CD-RW 
and replace them with the new ones that you dragged to the CD/DVD Creator 
window. Not bad at all, eh?

Burning ISO Images to Disk
When you download Fedora Core or other Linux distributions from the 
Internet, you usually download them in the form of one or more disk images, 
which are commonly referred to as ISOs because such files end in the .iso 
extension. An ISO is an image of a CD’s file contents, which means that it is 
the CD minus the media itself. To put it another way, if CDs had souls, the 
ISO would be the soul of a CD; take away the CD’s metal and plastic, and the 
remaining data would be an ISO. 
As it is impossible to download a physical CD over the Internet, the 
bodiless ISOs are the next best thing. For example, to get a working copy of 
Ubuntu from the Web, you need to download an ISO, which you then burn 
onto a blank CD in order to give the images their bodies back, so to speak. 
In the process you create the working installation disk that you need to 
install Ubuntu. 
Fortunately, burning an ISO to disk is a pretty simple chore. Just open a 
Nautilus window, and locate the icon for the ISO file you want to burn to 
disk. Right-click the ISO file, and in the popup menu that appears, select 
Write to Disc. Once you do this, the Write to Disc window will appear; just 
click the Write button, and you’ll be on your way.
Duplicating Data CDs
Duplicating CDs and DVDs is also easily accomplished in Ubuntu. Just right-
click the desktop icon for the disk you want to copy, and then select Copy 
Disc in the popup menu. The Write to Disc window will then appear. Click 
the Write button in that window, and the Nautilus CD/DVD Creator will begin 
copying the contents of the disk as a disk image to your hard disk. This may 
take a bit of time, so don’t worry. When it is done, you will be prompted to 
insert a blank disk into your drive. Once you’ve done that, the Creator will 
begin copying the disk image to the blank disk. 
If you want to know how to duplicate audio CDs, hang on until you get 
to Chapter 15.
Burning Multisession CDs
If you are coming from the Windows environment, you are no doubt familiar 
with multisession CDs. These are CDs on which data is added one session at a 
time. For example, you burn a few files to disk today, add a few more to the 
disk tomorrow and a few more files the day after that. Each time you burn 
additional files to the same disk, you are adding a session, which explains the 
name multisession. If that explanation seems a bit obtuse, you can basically 
think of them working like floppy disks (albeit with considerably more storage 
capacity). While Nautilus can read and display the contents of such multi-
session disks, it cannot (yet) write multisession disks. To do that, you will 
need a different disk-burning application. I recommend GnomeBaker. 

92
Chapter 6
You can download and install GnomeBaker via Synaptic (search for 
gnomebaker). Once installed, you can run it from the Applications menu by 
selecting Sound & Video GnomeBaker.
To burn the first session to CD, insert a blank CD-R disk (just close or 
cancel any Nautilus windows that pop up in response), and then drag the 
files that you want to burn during the session to the bottom pane of the 
GnomeBaker window, under the Data Disk tab (Figure 6-15). You can drag 
files from the file browser in the top two panes of the GnomeBaker window, 
from a Nautilus window, or from the desktop.
Figure 6-15: Using GnomeBaker to create multisession disks
When you have all the files in place that you want to burn, click the 
Create Data Disk button at the bottom-right corner of the screen. A new 
window, Create Data CD, will appear. In that window, click the drop-down 
menu button next to the word Mode, and select tao instead of default. Once 
you’ve done that, click Start, and the burning process will begin. GnomeBaker 
will eject the disk when the burn is complete.
Burning Subsequent Sessions
To add a new session to a multisession disk, make sure that the bottom pane 
of the GnomeBaker window is empty (click the Clear button if it isn’t), and 
then insert the multisession disk into your drive. After your drive has finished 
its spinning and you have pushed the Navigator window for that disk out of 
the way, click the Import button above the bottom pane of the GnomeBaker 
window. A small window will appear asking you to select the drive where the 
multisession disk is located. You most likely only have one drive, so the correct 
device should already be displayed. If so, click OK.
The files burned in previous sessions will now appear in the bottom 
pane, and they are identified by a CD icon to the left of the filename. To add 
additional files to burn to the disk (thus creating a new session), just follow 
the procedures you used for burning the initial session.

USB Storage Devices
No chapter dealing with file handling and storage would be complete with-
out touching upon the topic of USB storage devices, so that is exactly where 
I will now turn. Unless you have been under a digital rock for the past few 
years, you are no doubt well familiar with USB devices. Your printer is very 
likely a USB device, as is your scanner. And although your digital camera is 
not a USB device in the traditional sense, chances are that every time you 
connect it to your computer in order to transfer photos, you are doing so via 
a USB connector. 
Among the most popular USB devices out there are those for file storage. 
These include external hard disks, flash memory card readers, and the tiny, 
finger-sized devices known as flash drives (Figure 6-16). Flash drives are 
especially popular today, and deservedly so: they are quite inexpensive; 
extremely handy when you need to transfer fairly large, but not gigantic, 
amounts of data from computer to computer (from work to home, for 
example); and pretty safe in terms of cross-platform (including Linux) 
compatibility.
Figure 6-16: USB storage devices
Putting USB Storage Devices to Work
Let’s start with some good news here by pointing out that working with USB 
storage devices is really easy. Just plug the device into one of the USB ports 
on your computer. The LED on the device will do a bit of blinking as the 
system reads what’s on it, and after that, a disk icon for that device will appear 
on your desktop. A few moments later, a Nautilus window will open, revealing 
the contents of the device. You can then copy files to and from the device 
using the drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste procedures I mentioned earlier 
in this chapter. 

94
Chapter 6
Once you are done and wish to remove the device, right-click its desktop 
icon, and select Unmount Volume in the popup menu. A progress bar will 
appear in a small window as the system writes the new data to the drive. When 
the process is complete, the contents of the Nautilus window should revert 
to a view of your home folder, and the desktop icon will be gone. You can 
then safely remove the device from the USB port.
Since I have been talking about file storage, it seems only fitting to wrap things 
up in this chapter by teaching you how to create and extract compressed files. 
In the Windows world, these are generally referred to as Zip files, while in the 
Linux world, tarball is the operative name. The Linux name, in case you’re 
wondering, comes from the application that is used to create the archive for 
such files, Tar.
Anyway, to get some of the hands-on stuff down, we’ll be creating a 
Windows/Linux/Mac–friendly Zip file, and then extracting it. We can get 
down to business by opening a Nautilus window and creating a couple of 
dummy files to work with. You can do this by going to the Nautilus File
menu and selecting Create Document Empty File. A new file will appear in 
the Nautilus window, with its name highlighted. You can now just type a 
name for the file, such as the one I’m using: dogwood. Now repeat the process 
to create a second file. I’ll be calling that one violet. Use something equally 
evocative for yours. 
Now that we have two files to work with, let’s start creating the compressed 
archive by following these steps: 
1.
Select the two files either by clicking your mouse to the side of the files, 
and then dragging the cursor (with the mouse button still pressed) over 
both files until they are highlighted, or by holding down the CTRL key 
and clicking on each file individually.
2.
Once both files are highlighted, right-click either one, and select 
Create Archive from the popup menu. 
3.
In the Create Archive window that then appears, type blossoms in the 
Archive text box, and then select .zip from the drop-down menu button 
to the right of that. Once everything looks like what I’ve set up in Fig-
ure 6-17, click the Create button, after which a compressed archive of 
your two files (blossoms.zip) will appear in your home folder.
Figure 6-17: Creating a compressed archive
Project 6: Creating and Extracting Compressed Files

A Tidy Nest
95
Now that you know how to put things together, let’s get back to work and 
learn the equally simple task of ripping it all apart—well, okay, extracting it. 
1.
Drag the original dogwood and violet files to the Trash to get them out 
of the way.
2.
Double-click the blossoms.zip file you’ve just created. A window showing 
the contents of the file will then appear (Figure 6-18). 
Figure 6-18: Extracting a compressed archive
3.
In that window, click the Extract button, after which another window, 
Extract, will appear. Click the Extract button in that window, and within 
a second (two at the most), you will find two new copies of dogwood and 
violet in your home folder.
Now you’ve created and extracted a compressed archive, which is in 
this case a Zip file. You can also create a compressed tarball in the future 
by following the same procedure (hopefully with real rather than dummy 
files), but when it’s time to select an archive type, select .tar.gz instead of 
.zip. Other than that single step, it is the same creation and extraction 
process.

Customizing the Look and Feel of Your System
Before entering the world of Linux, I had 
used just about every desktop operating 
system around. Despite the differences 
among them all, however, one thing that I even-
tually suffered from in each case was a kind of visual 
boredom. I suppose you might call it GUI fatigue. 
It wasn’t that I was tired of using a graphical interface; it was just that I couldn’t 
help but get sick of looking at the same old icons, window borders, and color 
schemes. Of course, there were some changes that could be made, but it just 
wasn’t possible to get around the basic look and feel without add-ons that 
demanded a price in terms of performance.
One of the features of Linux that pleased me to no end, and continues 
to do so, is that users can drastically change the look of things. I don’t mean 
just the icons and backgrounds, but everything, including the actual window 
borders and controls. Add to that the variety of graphical desktop environ-
ments and window managers available for Linux, and you have a totally 
customizable system. Is it any wonder that there are so many more Linux 

98
Chapter 7
desktop screenshots out there on the Web than for any other system? If you 
don’t believe me, just have a look at a site dedicated to Linux screenshots, 
www.lynucs.org, and click the Screenshots link.
You may not be as fickle as I am in terms of the look and feel of your 
system, but you can learn to use and enjoy all the graphical customization 
power that Linux offers you as you work through this chapter.
If you are reluctant to alter the look of your present setup, you can create a 
new user account and experiment with making the changes in this chapter 
when logged in to the new account. If you opt to go this route, your regular 
home environment will remain untouched because look-and-feel customi-
zations that are performed in one user account do not affect other user 
accounts. When you are all done with the project, you can then simply 
delete the new user account. Either way, it’s up to you.
To set up a new user account, follow these steps:
1.
Go to the System menu, and select Administration Users and Groups.
2.
When prompted for your password, type it, and then click Continue.
The Users and Groups window will open. 
3.
In the Users and Groups window, click the Add User button, which will 
bring up a User Account Editor window.
4.
Type a new username: graphika. In the Real Name field, you can type 
whatever you like; I used Graphics Lover in the example. Then move on 
down to the Password section of the window, skipping over Contact 
Information, and type an easy-to-remember user password in the two 
password boxes; in this case, the one you’re using for your present account 
will do just fine. Once you’ve done all this, your window should look more 
or less like that in Figure 7-1. 
5.
If everything looks fine and dandy, click OK to close the window and get 
back to the Users and Groups window, which will now list your new user 
account right below your current one (see Figure 7-2). 
Before using the graphika account, you need to give yourself user 
privileges to install software while logged in with it. Normally, this privilege 
is disabled by default on new user accounts, as you probably don’t want 
your kids, workmates, or anyone else with their own user account on your 
computer installing all sorts of weird stuff and screwing up your system 
settings.

Figure 7-2: The new user account displayed in the Users and 
Groups window 
To change the privileges for the graphika account, click the graphika
entry within the User list to highlight it. Once you’ve done that, click the 
Properties button. A new window, Settings for User graphika, will then 
appear. In that window, click the User privileges tab, and then check the 
box next to the words Executing system administration tasks (as shown in 
Figure 7-3). Once you’re done, click OK, and then exit the Users and 
Groups window by clicking OK again.

Chapter 7
Figure 7-3: Changing user account privileges
Logging In to Your New Account
To use this new account, go to the System menu and select Log Out (or just 
click the Logout button at the far-right corner of the top panel). When the 
logout window appears, click Log Out. After a few seconds, you will be back 
at the login screen. Type your new username in that window, and then press 
ENTER. After that type the new password for the account, and press ENTER
again. You will soon be at the desktop for your new user account.
Switching Users
It’s worth knowing that there is another way to switch users other than simply 
logging out of one account and into another. This alternative approach is 
logically referred to as switching users. Switching users differs from the logout/
login approach, in that you remain logged in to your original account while 
you log in to your other account (or while someone else with an account on 
your computer logs in to theirs). Going this route keeps all of the windows or 
applications you have open. These windows will not appear in the account 
you are switching to, but they will be there, conveniently waiting for you, 
when you switch back to the account from whence you came.
This is a good way to proceed if you plan to be switching back and forth 
between your two accounts. It is also a good approach when, say, your child 
needs to log in to his or her account for a moment to do a quick email check, 
burn a CD to play on the way to the beach, or print a file for school. When 
your child is done, you can quickly get back to what you were doing before 
without having to reopen files, web pages, or whatever else you happened to 
be dealing with at the time of the switch.

Dressing Up the Bird
101
You can switch users in much the same way you would using the logout/
login approach. After clicking the Quit button in the top panel, you can click 
Switch User instead of Log Out. You are then delivered to the login screen 
where you type the username and user password for the other account (each 
step followed by a press of the ENTER key), just as you would normally log in. 
To get back to your original user account after going the switch-user 
route, just click the Quit button at the right corner of the top panel, click 
Switch User (if you plan to return shortly to the new account) or Log Out
(if you don’t plan to return soon), and then once back at the login screen, 
type your original username, press ENTER, type your password, and press 
ENTER again. In the small window that then appears, click the Return to 
previous login button. 
Another window will appear, in which you must type the user password 
of the account you are returning to. Type your password, click Unlock, and 
you will be back at your original desktop, with everything as it was when you 
last saw it, open windows and all. Pretty cool.
Logging In to Another Account in a Separate Window
If switching back and forth between accounts seems like too much of a hassle 
to you, there is yet another, almost surreal, alternative—logging in to another 
account in a separate window while still in your regular user account.
This being-two-places-at-the-same-time approach requires a little bit of 
work up front, but it provides a lot of convenience in the long run, not only 
when going through Project 7B on page 102, but also whenever one of those 
“Hey ’rents, can I check my email for a second?” moments arises. To set 
things up so that you can do this, you need to install, set up, and use an 
application called Xnest. Here are the steps:
1.
Run Synaptic, do a search for xnest, and install it.
2.
Once Xnest is installed, close Synaptic, go to the Applications menu, and 
select Accessories Alacarte Menu Editor.
3.
When the Alacarte Menu Editor window appears, click System Tools in 
the left pane, and then check the box next to New Login in Nested Window
in the right pane. Click Close to finish.
After performing these steps, you can log in to your new account by 
going to the Applications menu and selecting System Tools New Login in 
Nested Window. An Xnest window will appear, and after a few seconds, the 
Ubuntu login screen will appear within that window. In that screen, type your 
new username (graphika, or whatever name you chose) and password as you 
would during any other login. Your new desktop will soon appear in the Xnest 
window (Figure 7-4). 
When you are done with your Xnest session, click the logout button at 
the far right of the top panel, and then click Logout in the set of choices that 
appears. The Xnest window will automatically close after you have been 
logged out of that session.

Whichever user account you’ve decided to play with, you are now ready for 
action. We are going to start off easy by just creating folders, but by the time 
we get to the end of the process, you will have created a much wilder, and, 
depending on how you look at things, gaudier desktop environment than 
you’ve ever seen before. All of this is in good fun, of course, and when you 
are done, you should be able to completely and confidently customize things 
the way you want on your own. So let’s go.
7B-1: Creating Folders
To get started, open your home folder. Unless you’ve been working on your 
own without me, there should be nothing there at this point except for the 
Examples folder, which I mentioned in Chapter 3, and a folder called Desktop, 
which basically contains any files, folders, and shortcuts to programs that you 
have put on your desktop. If you are anything like me, you will want to put an 
end to this rather empty state of affairs by creating some folders in which you 
can organize your files in the future. 
The first folder you will create will be for your documents, which you’ll 
call Documentia, though you can, of course, change the name later if you 
like. You can create a folder quite easily, much like you do in Windows, either 
by clicking the Nautilus File menu and then selecting Create Folder or by 
right-clicking in an empty space within the window and then selecting 
Create Folder from the popup menu. An untitled folder will appear. 
Project 7B: Customizing Your Desktop Environment

Dressing Up the Bird
103
Having a folder called untitled is, of course, a tad goofy, so you will want 
to change that. The text in the box below the folder will already be high-
lighted, so just type Documentia, and press ENTER. Once you have done that, 
the folder will show its new name.
Now you can repeat the process and create four more folders: Photos 
(for your photos, of course), Downloads (where you can dump any used 
files you will download along the way in this book), PDFs (for PDF files), 
and Music (for music files you will later learn to rip from music CDs with 
the program Sound Juicer). Once you have done all this, your home folder 
window should look like that in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: Adding folders to your home folder
7B-2: Adding Emblems to Folders
You must admit, things do indeed look a bit better than before, but this is 
just the beginning. To graphically remind yourself what each folder is for, 
you can add little folder-top icons called emblems. These can be added to 
any folder or file. For now, let’s add one to the Documentia folder by right-
clicking it and then, in the popup menu, selecting Properties. When the 
Properties window appears, click the Emblems tab and then scroll down until 
you see the emblem called Documents (Figure 7-6). Click the checkbox next 
to Documents, and then click the Close button. The emblem should now 
appear on your folder. 
Now, for additional practice, try adding the Sound emblem to your Music
folder. Just use the same steps as before, and substitute the appropriate items 
and entries.

104
Chapter 7
Figure 7-6: Choosing emblems for your folders
7B-3: Setting Window Backgrounds (and Emblems Again)
Once you’ve added those two emblems, your folders should look a bit 
spunkier. Nevertheless, the background of the Nautilus window is still white. 
You need not stand for that if you don’t want to; you can change it as well. 
To do so, just go to the menu bar of your home window, click the Edit menu, 
and select Backgrounds and Emblems. The Backgrounds and Emblems 
window will then appear (see Figure 7-7).
Figure 7-7: Choosing a background for your Nautilus window
From this window, you can drag any pattern into your home window, or 
into any other Nautilus window for that matter, and the pattern will then 
become the background for all your Nautilus windows. So, for experience’s 
sake, scroll down to find the pattern swatch called Manila Paper, and then 
drag it to the white space in the main pane of your home window. Once 
you’ve done that, the previously white window area will look like the wallpaper 

Dressing Up the Bird
105
in a lawyer’s office. Very nice, if you like that sort of thing. You can change 
it to a different background in the same way, of course, or you can go back 
to the default white by dragging the Reset swatch into the window.
NOTE
If you prefer to use an image of your own for the Nautilus window background, you 
can also do so quite easily. Just locate the image in a new Nautilus window, click it 
with both the left and right mouse buttons (or just the middle mouse button, if you have 
a three-button mouse), and then drag the image to any open space within the target 
window. When you release the buttons, select Set as Background in the popup menu 
that then appears.
In addition to the buttons for pattern and color swatches, there is a third 
button in the Backgrounds and Emblems window called Emblems. Clicking 
the Emblems button reveals all of the emblems you saw in Project 7B-2 on 
page 103, thus providing you with another way to add emblems to your 
folders. This method is far handier when adding emblems to several folders 
or files in the same go.
To see how this works, click the Emblems button. Then drag the Camera 
emblem onto your Photos folder, Package onto your Downloads folder, and
Special, for lack of a better choice, onto your PDFs folder. The selected 
emblems will then immediately appear on those folders. 
7B-4: Dolling Up the Side Pane (and Emblems Yet Again)
Now let’s change the look of the Nautilus side pane. Keeping the Backgrounds 
and Emblems window open (if you already closed it, open it again), click the 
Places menu button in the Nautilus side pane, and select Information.
You can add a different background pattern to the side pane now as well, 
but for practice let’s add a color instead. To do this, click the Colors button 
in the Backgrounds and Emblems window. The window will now be filled with 
swatches of color. Drag the Grapefruit swatch to your side pane, and it will 
turn from gray to, of all things, grapefruit (albeit a very dark and unusually 
colored grapefruit). You can also create a two-color gradation effect by 
adding yet another color. Drag the Mango swatch to the bottom of the side 
pane (but still within the pane), and you should have a grapefruit-to-mango, 
top-to-bottom gradation within the pane. Of course, if you are not pleased 
with this tropical color set, you can get back to your original default gray 
panel by dragging the Reset swatch onto the area. When you’re done, you 
can close the Backgrounds and Emblems window.
The side pane of your Nautilus window provides yet a third way to work 
with emblems. But before I let you in on this third, and last, way, you will 
need to add two more folders to your home folder. Create one folder and 
name it Finances, which you can use to store files dealing with your relative 
worth in the modern scheme of things, and then create another and call it 
MyFaves, where you can place . . . well, your favorite files. 
After you’ve created the new folders, go to the side pane, click the 
Information drop-down menu, and select Emblems. A list of emblems will 
appear within the side pane. Select the Money emblem, and drag it onto 
your Finances folder. Next, select the Favorite emblem, and drag it onto your 

106
Chapter 7
MyFaves folder. Your window should now look like that in Figure 7-8. Once 
you are done, go back to the drop-down menu and select Information to get 
everything back to relative normalcy again. 
Figure 7-8: Selecting emblems from the Nautilus side pane
Even if it’s not your cup of tea, you have to admit that your Nautilus 
window is definitely more colorful now. You can, of course, change it to 
look however you want it to, but I’ll ask you to hold off on that a little while 
longer, because you are going to be doing a some more playing around 
with it shortly.
7B-5: Changing the Desktop Background
Now that your home folder window is all gussied up (or gaudied up, depend-
ing on your aesthetic sense of things), you may feel that your desktop looks 
rather drab in comparison. 
Changing the desktop background (often called wallpaper) is easily 
achieved by right-clicking any open space on the desktop and selecting 
Change Desktop Background in the popup menu. This will bring up the 
Desktop Background Preferences window (see Figure 7-9).
Installing Additional Wallpapers
As you can see, the default wallpaper in Ubuntu is called Ubuntu Lagoon, but 
other than that there really isn’t much for you to choose from. To remedy the 
situation, you need to provide some images of your own. These could be 
photos from a digital camera, works of art you created on your computer, 
or just about anything you want to put there. In this case, however, you are 
going to venture out onto the Web to get and then install some wallpaper. 
A number of sites provide free desktop wallpaper, such as those for auto-
mobile manufacturers, singers, television shows, and so on.

Dressing Up the Bird
107
Figure 7-9: Changing your desktop 
background
Two sites specifically geared toward Linux users are www.kde-look.org 
and http://art.gnome.org, but for this chapter, I will be downloading some 
wallpaper from the Slovak LinuxOS.sk site. If you want to follow along using 
the same Tux-chases-the-Windows-varmints wallpaper that I use, go directly 
to the wallpaper image by pointing your web browser to www.linuxos.sk/
downloads/wallpapers/4.jpg. When the picture appears in the browser win-
dow, right-click it, and then select Save Image As. In the Save Image window, 
give it a unique name (4.jpg doesn’t tell you much, after all) or use the one I 
gave it, windowsroundup.jpg, and click Save. If you prefer, you can download 
any wallpaper you like from wherever you like, as long as it is in a supported 
format, such as BMP, PNG, or JPEG. It’s all up to you.
Once you’ve downloaded your wallpaper, place it in your Downloads 
folder. After that, you can install it by going to the Desktop Background 
Preferences window and clicking the Add Wallpaper button. In the Add 
Wallpaper window that then appears, navigate to your new wallpaper, click 
it once to highlight it, and then click Open. The wallpaper will then appear 
highlighted in the Desktop Background Preferences window and will soon 
thereafter appear on the desktop itself (Figure 7-10). Once it does, click 
Finish to complete the process.
Hiding the Bottom Panel
By the way, you may have noticed that you can barely see the panel at the 
bottom of the screen in Figure 7-10. This is because the panel obscured 
the bottom of the new wallpaper, which irritated me. I went to the Panel 
Properties window by right-clicking some empty space in the bottom panel and 
selecting Properties in the popup menu. In the Panel Properties window, 
I clicked the checkbox next to the word Autohide and then clicked Close. The 
autohide function works just like it does in Windows or Mac OS X—the panel 
stays out of view until you move your mouse into the general vicinity of where 
it should be. You can make the same change if you like, but that is an aesthetic 
matter that I will leave up to you. Ah, the sweet taste of artistic freedom.

7B-6: Downloading and Installing the Art Manager (GNOME Art) 
Searching the Internet for wallpaper to install can in itself be a rather fun 
adventure, but sometimes it can also feel like quite a chore. Fortunately for 
you, me, and all involved in such things, there is an even easier way: the Art 
Manager. The Art Manager, also known as GNOME Art, is a handy application 
that searches the art.gnome.org site, and downloads a list, with thumbnails, 
of all the wallpapers that are available there. It can also do this for the various 
window border, controls, and icon theme sets that you can use in the follow-
ing parts of this project. Using the thumbnailed lists, you can easily download 
and install whatever you want—all without ever placing a cursor in your web 
browser. Needless to say, the Art Manager is decidedly cool!
Unfortunately, the Art Manager is not installed by default; however, 
after having gone through Chapter 5, you know how easy it is to download 
and install applications like the Art Manager. All you have to do is run 
Synaptic, do a search for gnome-art, and then install it. 
You can then run Art Manager by selecting System Preferences Art 
Manager. The GNOME Art window will then appear with absolutely nothing 
in it. To put it to use, and relieve that emptiness, go to the Art menu, and 
select Backgrounds GNOME. (You can select All instead of GNOME if you 
like, but it will take longer to download the list of available wallpapers.)
Once your selection is made, the Art Manager will begin downloading a 
list of all that is available for you at the art.gnome.org site. When it’s done, 
you will see a list of thumbnails for you to choose from (Figure 7-11).

Dressing Up the Bird
109
Figure 7-11: Installing desktop wallpapers using the 
Art Manager 
You can now install a wallpaper by scrolling down until you find one that 
suits your fancy, clicking it once to highlight it, and then clicking the Install
button. Art Manager will then download it, install it, and then automatically 
open the Desktop and Background Preferences window so that you can 
immediately apply it to your desktop if you like. As I said before, it’s a very 
handy tool to have, especially since you’ll be using it more soon within this 
project.
7B-7: Changing Window Borders, Controls, and Icon Sets 
Now we get to my favorite part of this journey through the world of digital 
cosmetic surgery—changing the way window borders and controls look in 
GNOME. Let’s set about doing just that.
The procedure is really quite easy. Go to the System menu, and select 
Preferences Theme. The Theme Preferences window will open and show 
you a list of the themes that are installed on your system (see Figure 7-12). 
The default theme in Ubuntu is called Human, but, as you can see, there 
are many others as well.
To get the hang of things, have a look at each of the themes listed by 
clicking them one by one. The changes will take effect immediately. Just click-
ing on a theme will change your window borders, controls, and even, if you 
take a peek in your home folder, the icons. This is especially noticeable when 
you click Crux or Grand Canyon.
Each theme consists of a window border, a set of controls, and a collection 
of icons. This being the case, it is possible to mix and match these elements 
on your own. For example, let’s say that you like the look and color of the 
bubbly controls in Grand Canyon, but you prefer the window borders in Mist 
and the icons in Ocean Dream. Well, you needn’t despair, because you can 
create a custom theme consisting of these three different elements.

110
Chapter 7
Figure 7-12: Selecting a theme in GNOME
To create your own mix-and-match theme, just click the Theme Details
button in the Theme Preferences window. A new window will open, and you 
will find three tabs: Controls, Window Border, and Icons. From within each 
of these tabs you can select the components you prefer. First click the 
Controls tab, and select Grand Canyon. Then click the Window Border
tab, and select Mist. Finally, click the Icons tab, and select Sandy, which is 
the icon set for the Ocean Dream theme. 
Now keep the Theme Details window open, but open your home folder 
and take a look at what you’ve done. Hmm . . . not bad. But, perhaps you 
don’t really like the look of those Mist window borders all that much. To find 
something that suits you better, click the Window Border tab again, and 
scroll down until you see something you do like (Crux seems to do the trick 
for me), and click that. Better? Now that you are satisfied, you can click the 
Close button.
You will now be back at the Theme Preferences window, where you will 
notice that at the top of the list, there is a new theme entry called Custom 
Theme. If you want to save this new combination for later use, click the Save 
Theme button. Doing so will open a dialog box in which you can name your 
theme and write a brief comment about it. So, name your theme, write a 
comment if you like, and then click Save. Your new theme will now appear 
in alphabetical order within the theme list under the name you chose. 
Once that’s all done, your home folder window should look like that in 
Figure 7-13 (and take a look at your panel and Applications menu while 
you’re at it). Ah, trés cool!

If you are excited about this customization thing but you’re not satisfied with 
the theme choices included with the system, you can download and install 
still other window borders, controls, and icons. To show you how to do this, I 
will walk you through creating a faux Mac theme, which will look fairly simi-
lar to the standard Aqua theme of Mac OS X, as you can see in Figure 7-14.

Getting and Installing the Files You’ll Need 
To get the files you’ll need to do this, take the Art Manager for another ride. 
Once it is up and running, go to the Art menu, and select Backgrounds Other. Once the list of available wallpapers appears in the Art Manager 
window, scroll down until you find one called Real shoot, install it, and then 
apply it in the Desktop Background Preferences window, which will auto-
matically open. 
Now to get an appropriate window border for your new theme, go back 
to the Art menu, but this time select Desktop Themes Window Border.
Look for one called Hacked, and install it. When the Theme Preferences 
window automatically appears, click the Theme Details button, and click 
the Window Borders tab. In the list that appears in that tab, click Hacked.
Close the Theme Details and Desktop Background Preferences windows to 
complete the task.
Next get a set of matching application control widgets by going back to 
the Art Manager Art menu and selecting Desktop Themes Application.
When the list is downloaded, look for a file called Yattacier 3, and install it. 
In the Desktop Background Preferences window that then appears, click 
Theme Details as you did before—but this time around click the Control tab, 
and select Yattacier3 in the list within that tab.
To round things up, let’s add some new icons to the mix by going back to 
the Art Manager, heading to the Art menu, and selecting Desktop Themes Icon. Once the list is downloaded, look for and install Snow-Apple. After 
that it’s basically a repeat of the previous step, but this time around, click 
the Icons tab in the Theme Details window, and then select Snow Apple.
Finishing Touches
Well, things are certainly sort of Mac-ish now, but there is even more we can 
do to emphasize the effect. First, open a Nautilus window, click the Computer
button, and then drag the Filesystem icon to your desktop. This will create 
an alias of your hard disk there. Next, go to the bottom panel, and remove 
everything except Trash. After that, open the Preferences window for your 
bottom panel by right-clicking the area to the far right of Trash and selecting 
Properties in the popup menu. In the General tab of that window, uncheck 
Expand, and then increase the size of the panel to around 54 pixels. When 
you’re done, click Close, and then start adding launchers for the applica-
tions you use most. 
Finally, go to the top menu, and remove the three icons next to the System 
menu. After that, add a Window Selector applet, so that you have some way 
to navigate through your open windows. You might also want to change the 
background in your home folder, since the warm tones presently there no 
longer match your new cooler configuration.
The transformation is now complete, and if you followed along correctly, 
your desktop should look something like mine back in Figure 7-14. You can 
stick with your new OS X–ish theme, or switch to something else. For consis-
tency’s sake, I will switch back to Human now. By the way, if you do decide to 
keep the faux-Aqua theme, remember to click the Save Theme button in the 
Theme Preferences window and give the theme a name.

As you are already aware, unlike Windows, Mac OS X, or other Linux 
distributions, Ubuntu has a completely empty desktop upon installation. A 
lot of people advocate this approach because it discourages the permanent 
use of the desktop as a location to store files and program launchers. After 
all, as the argument goes, you don’t place your trash can or file cabinet on 
the desktop in your office, do you? 
All such logic aside, there are still many people who prefer to have their 
trash can, hard disk, and home folder on their desktops, thank you very 
much. If you are one of them, as I am, here’s what you need to do:
1.
Press ALT-F2 to bring up the Run Application window. This keyboard 
shortcut is the equivalent of clicking the Run Application panel applet 
that you placed on the panel in your original user account.
2.
Run the GNOME Configuration Editor by typing gconf-editor in that 
window and then pressing ENTER.
3.
When the Configuration Editor window appears, click the small arrow 
next to apps, scroll down to nautilus, and click the small arrow next 
to that.
4.
Click desktop in that expanded nautilus section, after which the options 
for that item will appear in the right pane of the window (Figure 7-15).
Figure 7-15: The Configuration Editor
5.
Check the boxes next to the items you would like to appear on the 
desktop. You have four unchecked choices to choose from: computer_
icon_visible (like My Computer in Windows), documents_icon_visible 
Project 7C: Placing Hard Disk and Trash Icons on the Desktop

114
Chapter 7
(to create a link to your Documents folder, if you have one), home_icon_
visible (for quick access to your home folder), and trash_icon_visible 
(for you-know-what). 
6.
When you’re done, close the Configuration Editor.
NOTE
Changes made in the way I just described will affect all user accounts. If you choose, 
for example, to show the trash can on the desktop for one user account, it will appear 
there for all others.
You may have noticed while working with the Art Manager that there is a 
menu selection (Art Other Themes) for something called Login Manager. 
The Login Manager is your login screen, also known as a greeter—the screen 
where you type your username and user password when you first log in to 
your system. The Login Manager is another thing that you can customize, 
but be forewarned that any changes you make will be system-wide, not just 
for you; whatever Login Manager theme you install and choose will be the 
Login Manager theme that everyone else with user accounts will see when 
they use the machine. Of course, if you are the only one using your machine, 
this point is moot.
7D-1: Downloading a Login Manager Theme
In order to try customizing the Login Manager, run the Art Manger, and 
select Art Other Themes Login Manager. Once you’ve done this, browse 
through the various themes in the list, and choose one or two that you want; 
I give you free rein on this one, but I’ll be choosing the theme called SVG 
Sakura, in case you want to follow along exactly. 
Unlike your other experiences with the Art Manager up to now, Login 
Manager themes can only be downloaded, and you have to do the installa-
tion yourself. That being the case, once you’ve made your selection, click the 
Download Only button. Once the download is complete, you will find the file 
in archive form, with a tar.gz ending, in your home folder, or any other folder 
you decided to save it to. You do not need to extract, or untar, the archived file.
7D-2: Installing Your New Login Manager Theme
Once you’ve downloaded a theme or two of your liking, you need to open 
the Login Screen Setup window. To do this, go to the System menu, and 
select Administration Login Window. A dialog box asking for your password 
will then open. Type the password for the account you are currently using, 
and click OK. The Login Window Preferences window will soon appear (see 
Figure 7-16), showing a thumbnailed list of the greeters available.
You can add the greeters you just downloaded to this list by dragging the 
files directly to the list. A small window will then appear, asking if you’re sure 
that you want to install the file you’ve just dragged to the list, and since you 
do want to install the file, click Install.

To select the greeter you wish to use, just click the round button next to 
its name in the list in the Login Window Preferences window, and then click 
the Close button. Of course, to see your greeter in action, you will have to log 
out first so you can log back in, but you needn’t restart or shut down the 
machine. You can then see your new greeter when the login screen appears 
(Figure 7-17), though yours may well be different.

Well, now you’ve changed just about all there is to change system-wise, but 
there is actually one more item that you can tinker with—your splash screen. 
In case you’re not familiar with the term splash screen, it’s the screen that 
appears when GNOME is starting up right after you log in but before you 
get to your desktop. The default screen, shown in Figure 7-18, is pleasant 
enough, but you can choose something a bit wilder or at least more colorful 
if you are so inclined.
Figure 7-18: The default Ubuntu splash screen
7E-1: Installing New Splash Screens
Ubuntu does not come with any alternative splash screens for you to play 
with, so in order to make changes, you first need to download and install 
some splash screens with which to work. This can be done quite easily by 
opening Art Manager (System Preferences Art Manager) and following 
these steps:
1.
Go to the Art menu, and select Other Themes Splash Screen. Art 
Manager will then download the available splash screens.
2.
Once the download is complete, scroll through the offerings, and select 
one that suits your fancy by clicking it once.
3.
After your selection has been made, click the Install button, after which 
Art Manager will download and install the file. When it’s done, the 
GNOME Splash Screen Preferences window will appear, showing the 
newly installed screen.
4.
Go back to the Art Manager, and repeat steps 2 and 3 to add a few more 
screen choices to your repertoire. 
5.
Once you have installed three or four splash screens, close Art Manager.

Enabling Automatic Login
While the Login Window Preferences window is open, it is as good a time as 
any to mention an option that may well be of interest to you. If you find it a 
bit of a drag to type your username and password every time you start up 
your machine, you’ll be happy to know that you can bypass the whole login 
process. If you share your machine with other users, of course, this isn’t 
something you’d want to do because anybody with access to your machine 
would thus have access to your user account. I also wouldn’t recommend 
doing so on a laptop, since they are more easily lost or stolen, thus leaving 
your data at risk to absolute strangers.
To enable automatic login, click the Security tab in the Login Window 
Preferences window, and then click the checkbox at the top of the page, next 
to the words Enable Automatic Login. After that, click the arrow at the right 
side of the drop-down menu, next to the word User, and select your username 
from the list. Once you’re done, click the Close button. The next time you 
start up your machine, you will bypass the login screen and be delivered 
directly to the desktop. 
7E-2: Selecting and Activating Splash Screens
When you have multiple splash screens installed on your system, you can 
select and then activate them via the GNOME Splash Screen Preferences 
window (Figure 7-19), which should already be open. When it isn’t, you can 
bring it up by going to the System menu and selecting Preferences Splash 
Screen.
Figure 7-19: Choosing a new login screen 
To select and then activate a splash screen, make your selection by click-
ing on the splash screen of your choice once, and then click the Activate
button. You will then see your splash screen in action when you next log in 
to your system.

Choosing a Screensaver
Screensavers used to be a must-have (and must-use) item for computer 
users who wanted to prevent damage (burn-in) to their monitors. Video 
display technology, however, has now advanced to the point where screen-
savers are no longer completely necessary. Nevertheless, screensavers are 
cool to look at, and one very nice thing about Ubuntu is that it comes with 
an unusually extensive collection of screensaver modules—nearly 200 of 
them! There are so many that you are sure to find at least a few you like. 
The screensaver settings are preconfigured to switch between modules 
randomly, changing the current module every few minutes. You can change 
these settings by going to your System menu and selecting Preferences  
Screensaver.
The Screensaver Preferences window, shown in Figure 7-20, allows you 
to do a variety of things, such as set the length of time between module 
changes and the length of idle time before the screensaver starts up. You 
can also opt to use only one screensaver module or no screensaver at all. 
In random mode, you can also omit the modules that you don’t like by 
unchecking the boxes next to the undesired modules’ names. This can 
be quite useful, especially if certain screensavers seem to tax the graphic 
capabilities of your machine.
Figure 7-20: Setting screensaver preferences
It’s time to bring this rather lengthy exercise in customization to a close. Now 
that you know how to do most of the things you might want to do in this area, 
you can return to your own user account and use what you’ve learned to make 
changes that suit your own tastes and desires.

If you’ve really gotten hooked on this customization thing, you’ll be happy 
to know that there are always more things you can bend to your will. In addi-
tion to being able to customize your system sounds, the splash screen that 
appears after you log in, and the system fonts that are displayed in your menus 
and folders, you can also play around with the many applications that allow 
customizations through the use of skins designed specifically for those apps. 
Perhaps the most notable of these customizable applications is Firefox, 
which you first met in Chapter 4. Firefox allows you to change the look of its 
buttons, application controls, and even background colors through the use 
of themes, some examples of which you can see in Figure 7-21. You will be glad 
to learn that downloading and installing these themes is a fairly straight-
forward process, so to finally wrap things up, I will end this chapter by 
providing you with the steps you need to follow:
1.
In Firefox, go to the Tools menu, and select Themes. The Firefox 
Themes window will then appear.
2.
In the bottom-right corner of that window, click the Get More 
Themes link.
3.
A new Firefox window listing available themes will then appear. Click 
any of the links to see a preview of that theme, or browse the available 
themes categorically by clicking the category links at the left side of 
the page.
4.
When you find a theme you like, click the Install Now link on the page 
for that theme.

A confirmation window will then appear, asking if you’re sure that you 
want to install the theme in question. Click OK.

Once the theme is downloaded and installed, it will appear in the list of 
available themes in the left pane of the Themes window (Figure 7-22). 
Select the theme you want to use by clicking it once, and then click the 
Use Theme button.

Getting to Know the Linux Terminal and Command Line
Many people shy away from Linux because 
they envision it as a system for compu-geeks, 
an environment in which you do everything 
the hard way—by command line. In this era 
of graphical interfaces, the idea of typing commands 
to get things done seems a dreadful throwback to 
the days of DOS, and that puts many people off—
especially those who remember what it was like in 
the “old days.”
This reaction is fair enough, but it is not really an accurate reflection of 
the reality of the Linux world. After all, most Linux users today utilize some 
sort of graphical interface. They can, and often do, achieve all that they hope 
to achieve through drop-down menus and mouse clicks alone. Many are 
able to survive quite happily without ever once opening their Terminal. 
The same could be true of you.

122
Chapter 8
Be that as it may, there is still much to be said for the power and conven-
ience of the command line. The fact that the command line can now be 
utilized within a graphical environment also makes it much less forbidding. 
The Terminal is just a tiny text-based island in a sea of graphical bodies (see 
Figure 8-1). Using the command line can be as pain-free as anything else you 
do on your system, and it can actually provide you with a little fun if you are 
willing to give it a try.
Figure 8-1: Putting the Terminal in perspective
Unfortunately, many guides to using the command line are written by 
hard-core command-line junkies, whose enthusiasm for what they see as a 
really good thing inadvertently makes what they write seem even more off-
putting to the recent Linux immigrant or wannabe. 
For your sake, I will try to curb my own enthusiasm so as not to scare 
you right back to Chapter 5 and the more comfortable world of Synaptic. I 
will also try to help you keep things in perspective by teaching you, whenever 
possible, to use the command line as a complement to the various graphical 
tools that you have at your disposal, rather than presenting it as the sole way 
of going about things. Of course, I am not going to cover every possible angle 
in this regard—just enough to give you some exposure and experience and, 
hopefully, make you feel at least a little more at ease with the command line. 
Who knows; could you actually come to think of using the command line 
as . . . fun? Well, I won’t get too carried away.

Simple Kitten Ways
123
Meet the Terminal
The Linux Command Terminal application in your Ubuntu system can 
be run by going to the Applications menu and selecting Accessories  
Terminal. When the Terminal opens, it will, in all its simplicity, look much 
like Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2: The Terminal application
As you can see, all it says is rg@RG-Vaio-on-Ubuntu:~$. In this case, the rg
is my username, RG-Vaio-on-Ubuntu is the name I gave my computer during 
installation, and the tilde (~) signifies that I am in my home folder. If it were 
to say ~/Music, for example, it would mean that I am currently in the Music 
folder within my home folder. Of course, all this will be different in your 
case, as your username and computer name will be different. If your user-
name is frog and your computer’s name is wetrock, for example, the command 
line will say frog@wetrock:~$. If all this is sounding rather obtuse to you, just 
think of it this way: username@computer_name:~$ in the Terminal is the equivalent 
of your home folder in Nautilus.
Typing in the Terminal is straightforward enough; you just type as you 
usually do. You can also delete and insert letters or phrases by using the DELETE
and BACKSPACE keys and the cursor keys. For practice, try the following:
1.
Type I like strawberries so very much.
2.
Change strawberries to cherries (because cherries are, in fact, so much 
better). Just use your left cursor key to move the cursor in front of the 
first s in strawberries.
3.
Tap your DELETE key as many times as necessary to erase the word 
strawberries (uh, that would be 12 times, methinks).
4.
Just type cherries, and then use your right cursor key to move the cursor 
back to the end of this meaningful sentence.
Now that you’ve completed this fascinating bit of typing practice, press 
the ENTER key. As you will almost immediately see, the Terminal’s response 
to your efforts thus far is merely a dismissive bash: I: command not found.
Although you’ve typed a string of text that has meaning to you, it means 
absolutely nothing to your system. In fact, the system was so shortsighted 

124
Chapter 8
that it could see nothing other than the first word you typed in the Terminal 
(I); and because I is not a valid command, the system had no idea what do to 
with it.
Shells
You may be wondering what this bash business is all about and why it is 
talking to you. Well, Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is one of the many shells that 
are used in Linux systems, and it’s the one that happens to come with your 
Ubuntu distro (and most others, for that matter). A shell is a program that 
interprets the commands you type into the Terminal and delivers them, so to 
speak, to your system so that it can act upon them. I like to think of it as a 
command-handling subsystem, for which the Terminal acts as a graphical 
front end. Some scripting languages, as you will find out in Project 8C on 
page 142, also have their own shells; but other than those few exceptions, 
you generally need not be unduly concerned with shells other than to know 
what they are and what people are talking about when referring to them.
Some Goofy, Yet Useful, Fun with the Command Terminal
A rather cool thing about typing in the command Terminal is that it has what 
you might call short-term memory. Try it out by typing the word cherry and 
then pressing ENTER. Ignoring the command-not-found message, go on and 
type vanilla, and press ENTER. Now type icecream, and press ENTER. So far, so 
dumb, right? Well, not really. Let’s type everything we’ve typed thus far again, 
but this time let’s do it with only one key. 
Huh?
Yes, just press the up cursor key once, and what do you see? That’s 
right—the last command you typed appears, which in this case would be 
icecream. Press the up cursor key again, and the command that you typed 
before that will appear—vanilla. One more time? Yes, cherry. And one more 
time for the grand finale . . . I like cherries so very much.
Considering what we have thus far, this may all seem a bit silly, but 
imagine that you’re not typing goofy little words and instead have to deal 
with considerably longer strings, such as a simple copy command (which 
you’ll learn about later in this chapter) like
cp Photos/mypics/stpierre/coastal/onthebeach1_27.jpg /home/frog/
photos_for_mom/stpierre
By typing that string, you are copying an image called onthebeach1_27.jpg 
from the coastal folder to another folder called stpierre. If you wanted to copy 
another photo in the coastal folder, onthebeach1_16.jpg, for instance, you 
could simply press the up arrow key once, use the left cursor key and DELETE
key to move over to and delete the 27, replace it with 16, and then use the 
right arrow key to get back to the end of the command. All in all, it would be 
much simpler and much faster. It would also help you avoid mistakes in 
typing. Not so dumb anymore, eh?

Simple Kitten Ways
125
Nontoxic Commands
As you now know, all of this typing is easy enough, but in order to actually do 
something useful with your Terminal, you need to type commands—and 
there are more of them than you could ever hope or need to know. To get 
you started, we will begin with some commands that are easy to understand, 
nontoxic, and completely kitten-friendly.
$ whoami
There is no command as easy, safe, or even as seemingly useless, as whoami.
Rather than help those with multiple-personality disorders discover who they 
are at any given moment, the whoami command simply tells you which user is 
currently logged in. Try it out by typing whoami after the $ and then pressing 
the ENTER key. Remember that commands are case sensitive, so type 
accordingly.
The Terminal will now tell you the username of the person currently 
logged in. If you are logged in as frog, you should get frog as the answer to 
your command.
$ finger
If you enjoyed discovering who you are with the whoami command, then you 
might enjoy finding out even more about yourself using the finger command. 
The finger command can be used in a number of ways, but a very simple one 
is finding out about a particular user. Try this out on yourself by typing finger
and then your username. In my case, that would be finger rg. Once you’ve 
typed the command, press ENTER and see what you get. You can see my 
results in Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3: Output from the finger command
As you can see, my login name is rg, my real name is Rickford Grant, my 
home directory is /home/rg, I am using the bash shell for typing my com-
mands, I have been logged on since Wed May 17 at 12:12 EDT, my computer 
was idle for 2 hours 53 minutes (I went out to buy a toaster oven, in case you 

126
Chapter 8
were wondering), and I have no mail or plan. It doesn’t tell you my social 
security number or my mother’s maiden name, but it is pretty cool, don’t you 
think?
I mentioned that the results said I had no plan, and you may well be 
wondering what that is all about, so I’ll fill you in. A .plan file is a small file 
kept in your home folder that other users see when they use the finger
command on you. Traditionally, a .plan file contained information about 
where you were going to be or what you were working on. These days, how-
ever, most people use them to leave odd little messages, quotations, or 
whatever, much as they do in email signatures. Take a look at Figure 8-4 to 
see what happens after I add a .plan file to my home folder. 
Figure 8-4: Output from the finger command with a plan
You can now see my plan, which is a quotation from Kurt Vonnegut’s
The Sirens of Titan (or Al Stewart’s song by the same name, for that matter), 
though you can put anything you want in your own. You will get the chance 
to create your own plan file in Project 8A on page 136, so if this all seems 
fun to you, just hang in there.
Before moving on, I should mention that you can also use the finger
command to do a little domestic espionage of sorts. Let’s say your child, 
Chris, has a user account on your machine. Chris, who wants your permission 
to go to the movies, claims to have been hard at work on the computer all 
day writing up a report for school. Having your doubts, you could type finger 
chris to see what the facts actually are. It may be a bit underhanded and rotten, 
but it works. It also works both ways, so others can check up on you as well. 
You can give it a try right now by seeing when the last time you logged in to 
your graphika account was. Just type finger graphika, and then press ENTER.
You can even use the finger command to find out facts about people on 
other systems, providing their network’s finger service is active and you know 
their email address. Typing something like finger username@hostname.com would 
do the trick. Kind of cool, but also kind of spooky, I suppose. 

Simple Kitten Ways
127
$ pwd
If you know who you are but aren’t exactly sure where you are, pwd (print 
working directory) should come in handy. The pwd command tells you 
exactly where the Terminal is in your directory tree. 
Let’s say, for example, that my Terminal is in my personal home directory 
(which is actually called rg) in the system’s home directory (which is actually 
called home, and which is where all the user account directories are located) 
when I use the pwd command; I would, after pressing the ENTER key, get /home/rg
printed to my Terminal. You should get similar results if you try it out. 
NOTE
The word print, in this case, has nothing to do with your printer; it merely means that 
the response will be printed to, or displayed in, the Terminal.
$ df
Another safe and easy, but much more useful, command is df (disk file-
system). The df command tells you how much disk space you have used, as 
well as how much space you still have available, on each of the partitions on 
your various mounted disks. Try it out by typing df and then pressing ENTER.
Your output should look something like that shown in Figure 8-5 (depending, 
of course, on the size of your mounted disks and how they are set up).
Figure 8-5: Output from the df command 
As you will notice, the sizes are given in kilobytes (KB) rather than the 
gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB) you are probably more used to, but there 
is a way around this. Many commands accept a flag, or option, to further fine-
tune how the command performs. These flags are written directly after the 
main command and are preceded by a space and a hyphen. 
In this case, you can try using the -h (human readable) flag to have your 
figures come out in the way you are most familiar with. Try this out by typing 
df -h on the command line and pressing ENTER. The output should now 
appear in a more familiar format (see Figure 8-6).

128
Chapter 8
Figure 8-6: Output from the df command with the -h flag
$ ls
Another harmless but handy command is ls (list directory contents). The 
ls command shows you what is in your current directory. This is the non-
graphical equivalent of double-clicking a folder in Nautilus to see what is 
inside. Try it out by typing ls and then pressing the ENTER key. 
If you’ve been following my commands so far, your results should list all 
of the folders in your home directory. You can also use the -R flag to show not 
only the list of files in the folder, but also what is within the subfolders. Of 
course, you should have no subfolders in any of the folders you created in 
Chapter 6, so you can hold off experimenting with this for a while. Instead, 
try typing ls -a to see your invisible, or hidden, files. 
$ sudo
When you ran Synaptic back in Chapter 5, you were first asked to input your 
password before you could run the program. The reason for this, as I men-
tioned then, is that Synaptic installs the files it downloads in various folders 
throughout your system, almost all of which are write protected. By supplying 
your password, you are telling your system that you, as holder of the pass-
word, have the right to allow Synaptic to do that.
The command version of that same password-giving process is the sudo
command. To perform an operation in a folder that is write protected, you 
would first type sudo and then the command you want to perform. For 
example, if you wanted to copy an icon image, let’s call it myicon.png, to 
the globally located and write-protected pixmaps folder (/usr/share/
pixmaps), you would type sudo cp myicon.png /usr/share/pixmaps.
After typing a command preceded by the sudo command and pressing 
ENTER, you will be prompted for your password. Once you type your password 
and press ENTER again, the command will be executed. I should mention that 
once you input your password, it will stay in memory for about 15 minutes. 
This means that you will not be prompted for your password when using the 
sudo command again within that time frame.

$ locate
In contrast to the seemingly lightweight commands you have learned so far, 
the locate command is really quite useful. In fact, you might well find it a 
much easier, faster, and more effective method of finding files than the 
graphical search tool in the Places menu. Using the command is quite easy: 
you simply type the command followed by a space and the name of the file you 
are searching for. 
Before you can use this command, though, you will need to create a 
database of filenames for locate to use. This is quite easily done by using 
the sudo command, which you just learned about, and then typing updatedb
(Whoa, Nellie! Yet another command!), followed by a tap on the ENTER key 
(that would be sudo updatedb). After you type your password when asked to do 
so, it will seem that nothing is happening for a while, but don’t worry. As long 
as the cursor in your Terminal is blinking, progress is being made, and when 
your user prompt returns, you will have successfully created the database file. 
After that, you can go on and use the locate command.
To take this new command out for a test drive, let’s look for the 
openofficeorg-20-writer.png file that we worked with in Chapter 3. Just type 
the following, and press ENTER:
locate openofficeorg-20-writer.png
Your results should look like those in Figure 8-7.

$ calendar
I’ll let you experiment with this one on your own. Just type calendar, and 
press ENTER to see the somewhat interesting results.
$ exit
The exit command is a simple one that allows you to exit the Terminal. Just 
type exit, and press ENTER. The Terminal window will close.

Chapter 8
Commands with Some Teeth
The simple commands you have tried so far are all of the safe-and-sane, 
fire marshal–approved variety; they merely print information to your 
Terminal. Now you are going to try to get some real tangible results from 
the commands you use. These commands are also essentially safe and sane 
if you follow my instructions.
$ mkdir
You have already learned how to create folders by means of menus and your 
mouse, but you can also do this using the command line. The command is 
mkdir (make directory), and it is easy as pie to use (though I’ve never been 
quite sure how pie is easy). 
To see how this command works, and to work with the commands that 
follow, use the mkdir command now to create a folder called command_exp 
(for command experiments). All you have to do is type mkdir command_exp in a 
new Terminal window, and press ENTER. The new folder should appear in 
your home folder, so go ahead and check to see if it is there by clicking the 
home icon on your desktop.
Okay, good, bra, bueno! Now let’s create another new folder within that 
new folder—a subfolder, if you will. We’ll call this one sub. So, just type 
mkdir command_exp/sub, and press ENTER. You can now go take a peek and 
see if the subfolder appears within the command_exp folder, if you like.
$ mv
The next command is the mv (move) command, but before we experiment 
with it, we need to create a dummy file—we need something to move, after 
all. We can do this by using another command—touch. To make the file, and 
let’s call it expfile.txt, go to the Terminal, type touch expfile.txt, and press 
ENTER. The new file will now appear in your home folder.
To move the file that you’ve just created, you will use the mv command, 
of course. Just type mv expfile.txt command_exp/sub (this tells the system which 
file to move and where to move it to), and press ENTER. The file will now be 
in your sub folder.
$ cd
Until now, you have been using the command line from your home folder. 
With the cd command, you can change your Terminal’s location to another 
folder. This is a very handy command that you will be using quite a lot when 
doing the other projects in this book. To take it out for a spin, let’s get inside 
the command_exp folder by typing cd command_exp and pressing ENTER. If 
you’ve done this correctly, the prompt in your Terminal should now read 
username@computer_name:~/command_exp$. If so, you can pat yourself on the back.
While you are there, you might as well try out the ls command with the 
-R (recursive) flag to see how that works. Just type ls -R, and press ENTER.
Your Terminal should now show that you have a subfolder there called sub 
and a file inside that subfolder called expfile.txt. 

Simple Kitten Ways
131
That is all you really want to do in there for now, so to get back to your 
home directory, just type cd, and press ENTER, which will take you back home, 
so to speak.
For future reference, it is worth noting a couple of other cd command 
shortcuts. If you are within a subfolder of a subfolder and want to move back 
a step, so to speak (from /home/rg/peas/pudding to /home/rg/peas, for 
example), you can do so by typing cd .. (with a space between cd and ..) and 
pressing ENTER. You can also type cd - (with a space between cd and -) in 
order to get back to a directory where you were previously (from /home/rg 
to /home/rg/peas/pudding, for example).
$ cp
Being fickle, as humans are by nature, you might decide that you not only 
want your expfile.txt file in the sub folder, but that you also want a copy in 
your home directory, where it was in the first place. To copy expfile.txt, you 
can use the cp (copy) command. 
To do this, the command needs to know where the file you want to 
copy is, what it is called, and where you want to copy it, which in this case 
is to your home folder. Normally you would type cp command_exp/sub/expfile 
.txt /home/username to do this, but if you recall my mention of it near the 
beginning of this chapter, you can abbreviate the /home/username portion of 
the command string to ~/, which means the same thing, and is an important 
tip to remember, as the tilde is frequently used in online instructions. As 
reducing wear and tear on the fingers is always a desirable goal, type the 
following command, and then press ENTER:
cp command_exp/sub/expfile.txt ~/ 
Be sure to put a space between the file you are copying and its destina-
tion (in this case, between the expfile.txt and ~/). 
Once you’ve done this, you should have two copies of expfile.txt, one in 
your home folder and one in your sub folder. Go have a look to see the fruit 
of your endeavors.
$ rm
When you were a kid, you may well have experienced the joy of building a 
castle out of LEGO bricks and then the even greater joy of tearing the whole 
thing down (preferably by hurling D cell batteries at it). We will now embark 
on a similar move. The first tool in this nostalgic endeavor is the rm (remove) 
command, with which we can trash files. 
The rm command, albeit very useful and easy to use, should be used with 
caution. Once you remove a file with this command, there is no going back—
the file will not be placed in the Trash; it is gone for good. 
To play it safe, let’s try out the rm command by getting rid of that new copy 
of expfile.txt that we just created in the home folder. The basic rm command 
structure consists of the command itself, rm, followed by the name of the file 

132
Chapter 8
that you wish to remove. In this case, you want to remove the file called 
expfile.txt located in your home folder. Assuming your Terminal shows you to 
be home, remove the file by typing rm expfile.txt followed by a tap on the 
ol’ ENTER key. The file will then be gone, and gone for good.
Now, double your pleasure by getting rid of the version of expfile.txt 
that is located in the subfolder sub. In this case, you need to specify where 
the file is because it isn’t in the folder that the Terminal is in. Just type 
rm command_exp/sub/expfile.txt, and then press ENTER. Oooh, very cool. 
Brings ya back, doesn’t it?
$ rmdir
You will now continue the fun with the rmdir (remove directory) command, 
which is a bigger and more powerful version of the rm command. 
The rmdir command, like the rm command, should be used with caution. 
There are no do-overs with rmdir. Once you remove a directory or folder with 
this command, it is gone for good.
To try this command, you can get rid of that sub folder you created. Type 
rmdir command_exp/sub, and press ENTER. The sub folder should now be gone. 
Finally, to round out the fun, use the rmdir command once more to get rid 
of the command_exp folder that we created earlier. You’ve probably got it 
down by now, but just in case you haven’t, type rmdir command_exp, and then 
press ENTER.
$ chmod
In Chapter 6, you learned how to change file permissions via the Nautilus 
interface. This is without a doubt the easiest way to go about such things, but 
when you have a folder full of files, perhaps copied to your hard disk from 
CD, that are write protected, it can be quite tiring to change the permissions 
of such files one by one. In this case, the command-line approach proves to 
be much easier to deal with.
The command for changing file permissions is chmod (change mode). To 
use it, just type the command followed by the permissions you want to extend 
to a file, and then the location of the file itself. For example, let’s say that you 
copied a JPEG file, mybirthday.jpg, from a CD to the personal subfolder within 
the Photos folder on your hard disk, and the file is write protected. To 
change the file so that you have write permissions (meaning that you can 
alter the file), you would type the following and then press ENTER:
chmod 744 ~/photos/personal/mybirthday.jpg 
To change the permissions of all the files and subfolders (and all the files 
within those subfolders) in one fell swoop, you can add the -R (recursive) flag 
to the chmod command. The command would thus be as follows: 
chmod -R 744 ~/photos/personal

Simple Kitten Ways
133
The number 744, by the way, extends read, write, and execute (run) 
permissions to you, the owner, but gives read-only rights to everyone else—
a pretty safe choice when in doubt. If you want to figure out permission 
numbers for yourself, it is pretty easy. You are basically dealing with three 
number positions, each of which has eight numerical possibilities (0–7). The 
left slot represents permissions for the owner; the center slot represents per-
missions for the group; and the third slot represents permissions for others.
The meanings of the numbers themselves are as follows:
Figure 8-8 points out the meaning of each of these numbers and what 
each number slot represents. In fact, if you don’t mind a bit of simple addi-
tion, things are even easier to understand. To start out with, remember that 
1 = execute, 2 = write, and 4 = read. Add any of those numbers together, and 
you get the other permissions combos. For example, 1 (execute) + 4 (read) = 5 
(read and execute). As you can see, permissions aren’t all that complicated. 
Figure 8-8: The meaning of permissions numbers
Now if you’re more of a letters than numbers sort of person, you’ll be 
happy to know that there is another way to change permissions that is prob-
ably even easier. In this approach, you only have to deal with two groups of 
letters and the symbols + and .
The first group consists of the following:
7
Read, write, and execute permissions
6
Read and write permissions
5
Read and execute permissions
4
Read-only permissions
3
Write and execute permissions
2
Write-only permissions
1
Execute-only permissions
0
No permissions
u
User (owner of the file)
g
Group (specified group of users)
o
Others (anyone who is not the user or a member of the group)
a
All (all of the above)
764
The owner can read,
write, and execute
The group can read and write,
but not execute
Others can only read

134
Chapter 8
The second group consists of:
You might already be able to figure out how this is all going to work, but 
I’ll spell it out just in case your intuition is worn out for the day. Let’s say you 
want to change the permissions of a file (butterhaters.txt, for example) so that 
all users on your machine can read and write to it. After opening a Terminal 
window, you can make the change by typing chmod a+rw butterhaters.txt and 
pressing ENTER.
Oops! Just remembered that you don’t want anyone changing the 
content of the file, eh? Well, to take back the write permissions for that file, 
you just need to type chmod a-w butterhaters.txt and then press ENTER. As you 
can see, the + gives permissions, while the - taketh away.
Much simpler, you’ve got to admit.
A Couple of Other Biters You’ll Be Using Soon
This is as good a place as any to introduce two more commands that you will 
be called upon to use in this chapter and elsewhere in the book: ln and tar.
You needn’t practice with these yet, as you will be using them very soon, but 
you might as well know what they are all about.
$ ln
The ln (link) command is used to create a link file that launches or activates 
another file located in a separate folder. This is very useful when trying to 
activate a file that is buried deep in the subfolder of a subfolder of a subfolder 
somewhere on your hard disk. The command is very often used with the -s
(symbolic) flag, which provides essentially the same thing as the shortcut 
you’ve come to know in Windows, or the alias on the Mac.
The easiest way to use the ln command is to first use the cd command to 
change the Terminal’s location to the folder where you want to place the 
link. Then you can type the ln command on the command line, followed by 
the path of the file you wish to link to. For example, let’s say that you want to 
put a link in your home folder for an OpenOffice.org Writer file of your 
autobiography called myLife.sxw. The file is pretty well buried in a nest of 
subfolders deep within your home folder: /home/username/Documentia/
personal/self/autobiography/myLife.sxw. To create the link, you would 
open a new Terminal window, type the following command string, and then 
press ENTER:
ln -s Documentia/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.sxw
Once you are finished, the link will appear in your home folder as an 
icon matching the original file in appearance, albeit sporting an arrow to 
signify that it is a link.
r

w

x

135
$ tar
In Chapter 6 you learned to create and extract archives, or tarballs, but did 
you know that you can also create and extract tarballs using the command 
line? The tar command is your key to doing this.
To create an archive, you would simply type tar –cvf, followed by the name 
the final tarball will be, and then the name of the folder or file you are trying 
to archive. For example, let’s say that you want to create an archive of your 
photos folder, and you want to call it pics4pals. In this case, you would type 
the following command, and then press ENTER:
tar –cvf pics4pals.tar photos
As you no doubt noticed, there are some flags after the tar command in 
that string. The c tells the tar program to create a new archive. The v tells the 
program to be verbose, or, in other words, to tell you what it is doing in the 
Terminal as it is doing it. Finally, the f tells the program that what follows is 
the file information.
If, after creating the archive, you suddenly remember that there is one 
more file you want to add to the mix, you can use the –r flag to append the 
archive. For example, to add a file called cranky.png to the archive, you 
would type the following and then press ENTER:
tar –rvf pics4pals.tar cranky.png
Of course, chances are that you will be doing more tarball extracting 
than creating, so you no doubt want to know how to do that. Fortunately, 
the process is pretty similar to what you use when creating the tarball. The 
main difference is in the first flag. Rather than using the tar command with 
the –c flag, you would instead use it with the -x flag, which tells the tar 
program to extract the specified archive. So if you want to extract a tarball 
called spicyfood.tar, type the following command, and press ENTER:
tar –xvf spicyfood.tar
What you have been doing thus far is creating and extracting archives, 
which are basically just collections of files. They are not, however, compressed. 
In fact, most tarballs you find will be compressed, and you can tell by the 
ending tar.gz. That gz means that the archive was compressed using the gzip 
program. Extracting a compressed tarball is just as easy as extracting a straight 
tar archive; all you have to do is add the –z flag, which tells your system to use 
the gzip program to decompress the archive. For example, if you want to 
extract a compressed tarball called goosedown.tar.gz, type the following 
command, and press ENTER:
tar –xzvf goosedown.tar.gz

136
Chapter 8
Well, now that you know how to decompress and extract a gzipped 
tarball, you probably want to know how to create one. This is, again, little 
different than creating the tar archive itself; you would just add the –z tag 
to tell the program to use gzip to compress the folder. For example, to 
create a compressed version of your Documentia folder, which we’ll call 
tightdocs.tar.gz, for example, you would type the following, and press ENTER:
tar –czvf tightdocs.tar.gz Documentia
It’s worth mentioning at this point that you may also come across some 
files compressed with the bzip program. Such files are recognizable by some 
variation on the .bz file extension. Dealing with these files should pose no 
problem, as the commands are almost identical to those for gzip. Just 
substitute –j for –z in the command string.
Compressing and Extracting Compressed Single Files
If you want to compress or decompress a single file, there is no real need 
to use the tar program at all, since its purpose is to create archives con-
sisting of several files. You can instead use the gzip and gunzip commands 
directly. For example, to compress a file called matilda.png, you would type 
gzip matilda.png, and press ENTER. The matilda.png file would then become 
matilda.jpg.gz. To decompress the file, you would type gunzip matilda.jpg.gz,
and press ENTER, after which the matilda.jpg file would be back to normal. 
So can you compress an archive you’ve already created with the tar
command? Sure. For example to compress the spicyfood.tar archive we men-
tioned before, you would type gzip spicyfood.tar, and voilà—you’ve got 
yourself a compressed spicyfood.tar.gz archive. Pretty cool, don’t you think?
Well, now that you have a bit of command experience, it’s time to get some 
practice and put all those commands to good use. In this project we start 
off easy by creating a .plan file, like I mentioned in the section “$ finger” on 
page 125. The actual .plan file is a hidden file (as you can see by the period 
before its name), which contains the plan or message that you add to that 
file. That message will appear in the output of someone’s Terminal when 
they use the finger command to find out more about you. You may not 
need such a .plan file, but it is an easy enough way to get started working a 
bit more with commands and the Terminal itself, so let’s give it a try.
To start out, we are going to open the Terminal-based Pico editor to 
create the .plan file. To do this, open a Terminal window, type pico .plan
(being sure to put a space between pico and .plan), and press ENTER. Your 
Terminal should now look a bit different, as you can see in Figure 8-9.
Project 8A: Creating a Plan

Simple Kitten Ways
137
Figure 8-9: The Pico editor
You will now be looking at your new, and totally empty, .plan file within 
the Pico editor. All you have to do now is type your plan or message. Once 
you’ve done that, press CTRL-X to exit the Pico editor, and it will ask you if 
you want to save your work. You do, so type Y, after which you will be pre-
sented with a set of save options. You have already named the file .plan, as 
you can see near the bottom of the screen, so all you have to do is press 
ENTER. You will be back at your now-familiar user prompt in the Terminal 
window.
To wrap things up, you want to change the permission of the new .plan 
file by typing chmod 644 .plan in the Terminal window and then pressing ENTER.
The .plan file should now be in your home folder and visible by all, so go on 
and test your work by typing finger username and pressing ENTER. The message 
you entered in your .plan file should now appear in the results in place of 
the no Plan you found there earlier. If you want to change the contents 
of your .plan file later on, just follow the same steps, and change the text 
when the .plan appears in the Pico editor.
NOTE
The name of the .plan file is preceded by a period, which means that it is a hidden file. 
Thus, if you take a look in your home folder, you will not be able to see the file unless 
you have checked the box next to the words Show hidden and backup files in the 
Nautilus Preferences window.
Now let’s get some more experience behind the Terminal by installing a 
simple, and admittedly kind of silly, oracle program called pyWings (see 
Figure 8-10). pyWings will give you cryptic guidance in response to whatever 
questions you may ask it. 
Project 8B: More Command Practice with pyWings

138
Chapter 8
Figure 8-10: Seeking wisdom from pyWings
To use pyWings, you type whatever your confusion is in the input box, 
click one of the concern icons on the left (self, another, world), one of the 
realm icons on the right (love, work, truth), and hit the big button that looks 
like half an eye. The oracle will then tell you what it has to say. As an example, 
I asked the oracle why I haven’t become rich yet, and I picked self as my 
concern and truth as the realm. Figure 8-11 shows the wisdom that was 
bestowed upon me.
Figure 8-11: PyWings bestows its wisdom
As you can see, the oracle told me, “Release is not necessarily freedom,” 
which I will interpret as one of those “dreams come true, not free” sort of 
pieces of advice. 
Great. 
pyWings was written in a programming language called Python, which 
actually creates scripts rather than true conventional programs. You will learn a 
little more about this distinction in Chapter 9, but one of the differences I can 

Simple Kitten Ways
139
mention right off the bat is that you don’t actually have to install pyWings; 
you are simply going to put it on your hard drive in your home folder and 
run it from there, more or less as is. 
8B-1: Getting pyWings 
You are just about ready to begin “installing” pyWings, but before you 
do, you’ve got to get it from the project’s home page at http://pywings
.sourceforge.net/download.html. Just scroll down the page to the section 
below the words Unix/Linux/X11, and click the HTTP link, which will get 
you the file pywings-1.0.1.tar.gz (.tar.gz tells you that this is a tarball—the 
Linux world’s answer to Zip files). Be sure to place the file in your home 
folder so that you can follow along easily.
8B-2: Creating a LocalApps Folder for pyWings
As I mentioned before, you will be installing the pyWings program locally in 
your home folder. Installing a program locally means that you are installing 
the program and all its support and data files in your home folder. This 
makes things a bit easier, but it also means that the program will not be 
available to other users. It also means that, if you’re not careful, you might 
inadvertently delete it. 
To make things a bit easier and safer for you, you are going to create a 
folder in your home folder in which to place pyWings and all other applica-
tions that you install locally on your machine in the future. You will, logically 
enough, call the folder LocalApps. 
Let’s make the folder by command, in order to get some more practice. 
Go to the Terminal, make sure you are in your home folder, type the fol-
lowing command, and then press ENTER:
mkdir LocalApps
8B-3: Extracting the pyWings Tarball
Now it is time to extract the tarball. You can do this by the double-click method 
you learned in Chapter 6, but since we’re working with the command line, 
let’s use that instead. 
To start out, we’re going to place the tarball in the same folder into 
which we extract its files. Usually this isn’t necessary because the contents 
of most tarballs are already packaged in a folder of their own. By double-
clicking the tarball to open it up in File Roller, you can see whether things 
are packed in a folder or simply as a group of files. In the case of pyWings, it 
is the latter, so follow these steps:
1.
Create a pywings folder by typing mkdir pywings and pressing ENTER.
2.
Move the pyWings tarball into that folder by typing mv pywings*.gz pywings
and pressing ENTER.

140
Chapter 8
You can see that in this step we used an asterisk (*) to save some wear 
and tear on our fingers. The asterisk is a wildcard character that in this 
case told your system to move any file beginning in pywings and ending in 
.gz. Fortunately we had only one item matching those criteria. 
3.
Move over to the new pywings folder by typing cd pywings and pressing 
ENTER.
4.
Now we get down to the process of extracting the tarball itself using the 
tar command. To do this, type tar –xzvf pywings*.gz, and press ENTER.
Again, notice that we used the asterisk to save ourselves some key-
strokes, though we could just as well have typed -1.0.1.tar in its stead.
5.
Finally, type cd, and press ENTER to bring the Terminal back to your 
home folder.
8B-4: Moving the pyWings Folder to Your LocalApps Folder
The extraction process is now complete. Before going on to running 
pyWings, however, let’s move it to the new LocalApps folder you created 
in Project 8B-2 on page 139. To do this, type the following command, and 
then press ENTER:
mv pywings LocalApps
8B-5: Running pyWings
Now that you have pyWings in place and ready for action, let’s start up the 
great oracle right now so that you can get a better perspective on how to 
deal with the aspects of life that trouble you. 
In the Terminal, make sure you are in your home directory, type 
LocalApps/pywings/pywings.py, and press ENTER.
If all went according to plan, pyWings should be up and running and 
will soon be making you a wiser person.
8B-6: Creating a Launchable Link for pyWings
The method of running pyWings that you’ve just used works well enough, 
but it is a pain in the posterior to open your Terminal and type that some-
what lengthy string every time you want to find out what fate has in store for 
you. Let’s find a way to make things easier in the future. 
To run an application from the Terminal, you generally type the name 
of that application or, to put it more precisely, the name of that program’s 
executable file; the application’s name thus acts as a sort of command. In 
order for your system to recognize that command, however, the command 
(the executable file, or a link to it) must be in a location where the system 
can find it. Whenever you run a command of any sort, your system checks a 
series of locations (most of which are bin folders, where executable files are 
located) to find that command. 

Simple Kitten Ways
141
You can easily find out where these locations are by typing echo $PATH in a 
new Terminal window and then pressing ENTER. As you will see, on your 
Ubuntu system, these locations are: 
If the command you typed is in one of those locations, the program, or 
script, will run. As you no doubt know, however, pyWings is not in any of 
those locations. It is in /home/username/LocalApps/pyWings and is thus, in 
a sense, out of your system’s sight.
To remedy this situation, you could add the path of your pyWings script 
to the list of paths that the system checks for run commands, so as to make 
the system aware of your new application’s existence. However, let’s try 
another method that I think is easier. What you will do is create a link to 
pyWings, a sort of launchable alias, in one of the locations your system does 
check for commands. 
To create this link, you will be using three commands: cd (to change 
directories), sudo (to give yourself write access to the destination folder), and 
ln -s (to create the link). 
1.
In the Terminal, type cd /usr/games, and press ENTER. This puts you in 
one of the folders your system searches when you enter commands.
2.
Type sudo ln -s /home/username/LocalApps/pyWings/pywings.py pywings, and 
press ENTER. (Note that there is a space between the words pywings.py
and pywings at the end of that command string.) 
The pywings at the end of that command string is the name that you 
are giving the link; the name of the link thus becomes the command you 
will use to run the application. If you type nothing, the link will be called 
pywings.py, which would mean three more keystrokes for you every time 
you wanted to start the program.
3.
Type your password when prompted to do so, and then press ENTER.
4.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
8B-7: Running pyWings Again
Now that you have created the link, you should be able to run the pyWings 
program much more easily. To try it out, quit pyWings (if it is still running), 
type pywings in the Terminal window, and press ENTER. Your personal 
pyWings oracle should appear again.
You’ve managed to cut down on the number of keystrokes required to 
run pyWings from the Terminal. However, if you are really into this pyWings 
thing and want to use it often, it will probably be handiest to add a launcher 
to your panel, a drawer, or the Applications menu. 
 /usr/local/bin
 /bin
 /usr/local/sbin
 /usr/bin
 /sbin
 /usr/bin/X11
 /usr/sbin
 /usr/games

Chapter 8
To add a pyWings panel launcher, for example, right-click any open 
space in the panel, and select Add to Panel. When the Add to Panel win-
dow appears, click the Custom Application Launcher button. In the Create 
Launcher window that appears, type pyWings in the Name section, anything 
you want in the Comment section (Your Obtuse Guru, for example), and, 
assuming you created a launchable link in Project 8B-6 on page 140, type 
pywings in the Comment section. For an icon, click the No Icon button, 
and then look around until you find an icon that suits your fancy. I like 
gnome-eog.png myself. Once you’ve made your selection, click OK in the 
Browse Icons window, and then click OK in the Create Launcher window.
8B-8: Adding Emblems to Your LocalApps Folder
Now that pyWings is successfully installed and working, it is probably a good 
idea to add an emblem to your new LocalApps folder so that you don’t inad-
vertently dump it in the Trash someday. You have already learned how to do 
this in Chapter 7, so I won’t give you the step-by-step instructions. 
If you would like to reinforce the skills you’ve put to use in the previous 
project, why not go a bit Continental, and try out Briscola—a simple, yet very 
traditional, Italian card game (see Figure 8-12). Unlike pyWings, which is a 
Python script, Briscola is a script of a different flavor, written in a scripting 
language called Tcl, which uses something called Tk to create its graphical 
interface.
Figure 8-12: Briscola
Project 8C: Command Practice Review with Briscola

Simple Kitten Ways
143
8C-1: Getting Briscola 
You are just about ready to begin “installing” Briscola, but before you do, 
you must get it. You can get Briscola by going to the project’s home page at 
www.rigacci.org/comp/software and downloading in the traditional manner, 
but since we’re working with commands, let’s instead get Briscola by using a 
new command: wget.
To do this, just open a Terminal window, type the following command 
string, and then press ENTER:
wget http://www.rigacci.org/comp/software/briscola/briscola-4.1.tar.gz 
In your Terminal window you will see wget in action as it connects to the 
site where Briscola is stored and then downloads the file. When it’s done, you 
will find the Briscola tarball in your home folder.
8C-2: Extracting the Briscola Tarball and Renaming the Briscola Folder
Extracting the Briscola tarball is essentially the same process as that for 
pyWings; however, Briscola is already packaged within its own folder, so you 
won’t have to create a special folder for it. 
Although I am sure you now know the drill, I’ll tell you again. Just open a 
Terminal window, type the following command, and press ENTER:
tar –xzvf briscola*.gz 
A new folder, Briscola-4.1, will now appear in your home folder with all 
of the Briscola files in it. To make things easier to deal with in the future, 
let’s shorten the name of the folder to simply briscola. We already know how 
to do this via the right-click method, but this time around let’s to do it via the 
command line. To do this, you use, perhaps surprisingly, the mv command 
followed by the name of the file whose name you are going to change, followed 
by the new name of the file.
Give it a go by typing the following command and pressing ENTER:
mv briscola-4.1 briscola
8C-3: Preparing the Briscola Script
Most applications that come in tarball form include a README file, which 
includes information on what you need to do in order to install and use the 
application. If you double-click the README file in the briscola folder in 
Nautilus, you will see that the “HOW TO START” section tells you to adjust the 
first line of the briscola.tk script to point it to your Tk shell, and to adjust the 
second line of the script to point to the directory where the various Briscola 
files are located. 

144
Chapter 8
To perform the adjustments as instructed in the README file, just follow 
these steps:
1.
Find the Tk shell, called Wish, by typing locate wish in the Terminal 
window and pressing ENTER, and then note the location given on a piece 
of paper. It should be /usr/bin/wish.
2.
Direct the Terminal to the briscola folder by typing cd briscola and 
pressing ENTER.
3.
Use the Pico editor, which we used in Project 8A on page 136, to edit 
the briscola.tk file by typing pico briscola.tk and pressing ENTER. The 
briscola.tk file will appear in the Pico editor in your Terminal window.
4.
Change the very first line of the briscola.tk file from #!/usr/local/bin/wish
to #!/usr/bin/wish.
5.
In the second line, change /usr/local/games/briscola to /usr/share/games/
briscola, which is where you will place Briscola in just a bit.
6.
Press CTRL-X on your keyboard.
7.
Type Y, and press ENTER to save your changes.
8.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
8C-4: Moving the Briscola Folder to a Global Location
We could move the briscola folder to the LocalApps folder and play it from 
there, as we did with pyWings, but this time around, let’s do things a bit 
differently by moving the whole thing to global territory. This not only keeps 
it safe from our obsessive housekeeping tendencies, but also allows all users 
on the same computer to play the game. We will need to use the sudo com-
mand to do this so that we can have write access in those protected folders. 
To do this, just type the following command in the Terminal window, 
and press ENTER:
sudo mv briscola /usr/share/games
When you are prompted for your password, type it, and press ENTER.
8C-5: Creating a Launchable Link for Briscola
Even though we’ve moved Briscola to a global location, we still can’t run it 
with a simple one-word command because the briscola.tk file itself is not in 
the system’s command search path. Just as we did for pyWings, we will now 
create a launchable link for Briscola to solve that problem. Here are the steps:
1.
In the Terminal, type cd /usr/games, and press ENTER.
2.
Now create the link by typing sudo ln -s /usr/share/games/briscola/
briscola.tk briscola, and press ENTER.
3.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
You can now easily run Briscola by typing briscola in the Terminal and 
pressing ENTER.

Simple Kitten Ways
145
Can I Do the Same Thing with pyWings?
Sure. If you want to move pyWings to a global location, just follow the same 
procedure for moving the pywings folder and creating the link as you did for 
Briscola, making the necessary substitutions, of course. You will have to remove 
the previously created pyWings link, though, by typing the following com-
mand and pressing ENTER:
sudo rm /usr/games/pywings
After that, move the pywings folder to global territory by typing 
sudo mv ~/LocalApps/pywings /usr/share/games/pywings, and pressing ENTER.
When prompted for your password, type it, and press ENTER. You can then 
create the launchable link by typing cd /usr/games, pressing ENTER, typing 
sudo ln -s /usr/share/games/pywings/pywings.py pywings, and pressing ENTER
once more.
Playing Briscola
As I already mentioned, Briscola is easy—about as easy a card game as there 
is. It is a trick-taking game, which means that you put out a card, then your 
opponent puts out a card, and the one who puts out the higher point-value 
card wins the hand, or trick. Points are awarded on the basis of the cards 
involved in that trick. The winner of the trick then goes on to lead the next 
trick, meaning that the winner puts out his or her card first the next time 
around. When all the cards are played, the points for each player are then 
tallied, and the player with the higher points wins. All much simpler to do 
than it is to describe.
The Cards and Their Rankings
Like many other Italian and Spanish games, Briscola is played with a 40-card 
deck, consisting of the following cards: K, Q, J, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and the Ace. 
Traditionally, it is played with either French-suited cards (hearts, diamonds, 
clubs, and spades) or Italian-suited cards (swords, coins, batons, and chalices), 
usually dependent upon the region in which it is played. In the software 
version you have just installed, you will be playing with French-suited cards 
in the regional pattern of Tuscany.
Unlike most card games you are probably familiar with, the ranking and 
point values of the cards in Briscola is somewhat different, as you can see in 
the following chart.
Ranking of Cards
Point Value
Ace
11
3
10
King
4
Queen
3
Jack
2
7, 6, 5, 4, 2
0

146
Chapter 8
While this ranking arrangement might seem odd, it is actually fairly 
common in card games from the southern and Catholic regions of Central 
Europe. With that bit of information in mind, it should all be pretty easy 
enough to fathom, taking a religious view, that God (Ace) and the Holy 
Trinity (3) rank higher than the quasi-mortal royals (K, Q, J) and their 
decidedly mortal subjects (7, 6, 5, 4, 2). The rankings are thus quite sensible, 
albeit slightly ironic, given that some religions frown upon playing cards, 
calling them “the devil’s tool.”
Game Play in Briscola
Once Briscola starts up, it will deal three cards to each player. It will then 
take the seventh card and place it face up under the downward-facing pile 
of undealt cards, known as the stock or talon. That seventh card is called the 
Briscola (from which the game gets its name), and it determines the trump 
suit for that particular game. This means that any card of the same suit as the 
Briscola will beat any card of any other suit, even one of a higher ranking. 
Of course, when you play a trump card against another trump card, the 
normal rankings of the cards come back into play. 
It is important to note at this point that unlike many other trick-taking 
games, you are neither required to follow the suit of the card led in a trick in 
Briscola, nor are you required to beat it if you can. This means that if your 
opponent plays a club card, you can play a card of any suit you like, even if 
you have a card that can beat it, all depending on your own strategy for 
ultimately winning the game.
Before getting started, it is a good idea to first go to the Options menu 
and select Show Score. This will allow you to know how you’re doing as you 
play. Once you’ve done that, you are ready for action, and as your computer 
opponent is always kind enough as to allow you to lead, you can begin by 
clicking the card you want to put into play. Your compu-opponent will then 
play its card. 
Once you’ve assessed the situation, click on one of the blank spaces in 
your hand, and the points for that trick will be displayed in the box labeled 
You (if you won the trick) or the box labeled Me (if the computer won the 
trick). Of course, if the trick only involved the 7, 6, 5, 4, or 2 cards, no points 
will appear, as those cards have no point value.

Customizing the Terminal
As you now well know, the Terminal is a very simple application in terms of 
looks. It doesn’t have to be, however, because you can spice things up a bit 
if you’re so inclined. Not only can you change the background and text 
colors in the Terminal, but you can even display one of your favorite photos 
as a background (as shown in Figure 8-13) or make the background trans-
parent . . . well, kind of transparent anyway. 

Simple Kitten Ways

Figure 8-13: A Terminal window with customized background and font colors
To change the Terminal background, go to the Terminal Edit menu, 
and select Current Profile. When the Editing Profile window appears, click 
the Effects tab, select Background image, and then click the Browse button 
to navigate your way to the image you want to use (Figure 8-14). Depending 
on the image you use for your background, you may find it rather difficult to 
see the text once your image appears in the Terminal. If so, try moving the 
slider under the words Shade transparent or image background in the Editing 
Profile window. If that still doesn’t do the trick, click the Colors tab, deselect 
Use colors from system theme, and then try some of the preset Foreground 
and Background combinations from the menu button next to the words 
Built-in schemes (I used White on Black in Figure 8-13).
Figure 8-14: Customizing the Terminal window

148
Chapter 8
If you just want to make the background transparent, select Transparent 
background, and drag the slider near the bottom of the Editing Profile 
window to the far left. You can also use the slider to adjust the shading of 
your background image if you choose to go that route.
NOTE
The transparency effect used in the Terminal is a pseudo-transparency, as it is really 
just a mirroring of the desktop image. You will thus find, if you have any icons on your 
desktop, that when you pass the transparent terminal across such icon-laden areas, 
those icons will not appear in the seemingly transparent Terminal window—all you 
will see is the desktop wallpaper or background color. 
Depending on the colors present in your background image or in your 
desktop wallpaper (if you’ve gone the transparent route), you may also want 
to change the font color for your Terminal to make things easier to see. To 
do this, click the Colors tab, deselect Use colors from system theme, and 
then make the appropriate font color selection.
Tabbed Shell Sessions in the Terminal
To wrap things up in this chapter, I thought I might mention one particularly 
convenient feature of the GNOME Terminal: tabs. Just as you can view 
multiple web pages in one Firefox web browser window through the use of 
tabs, tabs in the Terminal application allow you to have more than one shell 
session running at the same time without having more Terminal windows 
open (see Figure 8-15). This reduces the amount of desktop clutter and 
generally makes things easier to deal with. You can open a new tab within 
the Terminal by going to the Terminal File menu and selecting Open 
Tab Default.

More Ways to Install Programs
In the past few chapters, you learned how 
to install applications via Synaptic and run 
script-type applications from the command 
line, which gives you quite a variety of applications to 
choose from. It is now time, however, to expand your 
application-gathering repertoire even further. 
In this chapter you will learn how you can add applications to your 
system in four other ways: compiling applications from source, converting 
Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) packages for use in your Debian-based 
system environment, running binary tarballs and Java-based applications, 
and—say it ain’t so—even running some Windows applications. When you 
are done, you will have more options at your disposal than you’ll know what 
to do with . . . and that’s not a bad position to be in.

Chapter 9
Compiling Programs from Source
For the beginner, just the mention of compiling a program from source 
seems off-putting enough. The words compile and source seem to instill a sense 
of foreboding in the heart of the new user. That certainly was the case for 
me, anyway. 
However, this method of installing programs is a lot easier than it sounds. 
In fact, now that you have some experience using the Terminal and command 
line, it is just plain easy—a sort of one, two, three, and you’re done process.
Of course, you can live long and prosper without ever bothering to 
compile anything on your system. You can move along quite happily with 
your system as is, or you can just install programs by means of the very 
convenient Synaptic application, which you learned about in Chapter 5. 
So why would you want to bother compiling programs from source? 
Well, although there are a lot of DEB packages that Synaptic can ease into 
your system, not every bit of software in Linuxdom is available in that file 
format. Or perhaps you want the newest version of the software you have your 
eyes on, but the version available via Synaptic is a slightly older version. Of 
course, there is that good old human nature factor at play as well—there may 
well come a time when curiosity gets the better of you, and you will want to 
move just one step beyond the way you’ve grown accustomed to doing things. 
After working through this short project, you will be able to do just that, and 
I am sure you will find that your initial worries will have been for naught.
What Is Source?
In order to understand what source is, you should understand a bit about how 
a program actually gets from its primitive state on the programmer’s com-
puter to an up-and-running application on your machine. First the program-
mer writes a program in a programming language. You have probably heard 
of programming languages such as BASIC or C, and there are many others. 
What the programmer actually writes with such a language is a set of instruc-
tions called the source code, or source. Your computer, however, cannot actually 
understand any of that source on its own. It is as if the computer speaks 
ancient Greek, and the source code is all written in French. The computer 
therefore needs some sort of interpreter to help it out.
The various languages that programmers use are called high-level 
languages—they are relatively easy for programmers to read. The computer, 
on the other hand, only understands low-level languages, which are quite 
difficult for most mere mortal programmers to deal with. To convert the 
high-level language instructions to a low-level language, the computer 
needs some other program to translate. 
This can be done while a program is running, in which case the trans-
lator program is called an interpreter. Applications that run using an inter-
preter are usually scripts. The pyWings and Briscola applications in Chapter 8 
are examples of such script applications. 

Dining on Tarballs, Binaries, Java, and Even RPMs
151
The problem with such scripts is that they can be slower than most of the 
applications you’re familiar with because the computer must run an inter-
preter, interpret the source code, and run the actual application all at the 
same time. This is like having a French book translated into Greek by a live 
interpreter—very slow indeed. 
As an alternative, most programs use a compiler instead of an interpreter. 
A compiler translates the high-level source code into low-level machine code,
or object code, that the computer can understand before the application is 
actually run. Once this translation is done, the computer never has to bother 
with the high-level instructions again; it can merely read the translated ver-
sion each and every time it runs the program. This is like having a translated 
version of a foreign book that you can read any time you want to. Because 
computers can run compiled programs without simultaneously using an 
interpreter, compiled programs run faster than scripts. Most applications 
for all operating systems are, therefore, compiled.
Tarballs: The Containers of Source
Almost all source packages come in the form of tarballs (tarballs, DEBs, and 
even the RPMs, such as those used in Red Hat–based systems, are all referred 
to as packages, which is why the icon for such files looks like a little parcel-post 
box). As you learned in Chapters 6 and 8, tarballs consist of a group of files 
that have been archived into a single file, which is most often compressed to 
save disk space, much like Zip files on Windows systems or SIT (StuffIt) files 
on Macs. In Linux, the most common method of creating such archives is 
through the tar program, from which the tarball gets its name, while the com-
pression of that archive is usually accomplished by means of the gzip program. 
Compressed tar files, or tarballs, can thus be recognized by their file endings, 
which are .tar.gz, or when compressed with the bzip program, tar.bz2.
As you learned in Chapter 8, the files archived in tarballs can be extracted 
by using the command line, but to keep things easy in this chapter, you can just 
use the simple double-click method that you used in Chapter 6, if you prefer. 
The Basics
As I mentioned before, the process of compiling an application from source 
and then installing it is actually simple. Basically, after untarring the source 
tarball, you would use the following commands to accomplish the task:
./configure
To configure a makefile, which provides instructions for the 
make command
make
To translate the source code into object code that the computer 
can understand
sudo make install
To give yourself write privileges in protected folders 
and then install the application
make clean
To clean up the leftovers once the process is complete (to 
clean up the mess)
I know that sounds like a lot of commands, but as I always say, it is easier 
to actually do than it looks like on the page, so fear not.

Chapter 9
Installing the Tools You Need
Because Ubuntu is designed with the average computer user in mind, it does 
not come with the various applications and libraries you need to compile 
applications from source. Fortunately, however, just about everything you 
need to get the job done is available via Synaptic. To get ready for the work 
at hand in this chapter (and many other jobs you are likely to do on your 
own in the future) perform searches for and install the following packages:
 build-essential
 checkinstall
 libgtk1.2-dev
I should mention that although there are only three packages you need 
to mark for installation, Synaptic will download and install quite a few more 
necessary packages in addition to these—a total of 29 packages, to be exact. 
Nothing to worry about though, just a heads-up so that you don’t go into a 
mid-1960s freakout.
To get some hands-on experience with compiling a program from source, 
you will be working with a game called Xmahjongg, which you can see in 
Figure 9-1. If you’ve tried out the version of Mahjongg that comes with your 
Ubuntu distribution, you will notice that this one is much easier on your 
eyes and is a bit more colorful (check out the project site at www.lcdf.org/
xmahjongg to catch a glimpse of it in its full four-color glory). 
Figure 9-1: The Xmahjongg game
Project 9A: Compiling and Installing Xmahjongg

Dining on Tarballs, Binaries, Java, and Even RPMs
153
Xmahjongg, the version of Mahjongg that we’ll be working with, is 
available via Synaptic, so it is not absolutely necessary to install it in this 
manner, but Xmahjongg provides a perfect opportunity to learn how to 
compile a program from source. The amount of source code isn’t all that 
great, so it won’t take too much time to do, and it requires no tinkering. 
In case you are not already familiar with this genre of Mahjongg game, 
the idea is simple enough. Each tile has an image and there are four of each 
tile in the pile. You must match pairs of like tiles that are open on at least one 
side. When you click the two matching open tiles, they will disappear. The 
object of the game is, thus, to remove all the tiles from the board. A very 
simple solitaire game.
9A-1: Downloading and Extracting the Xmahjongg Files
To get started, you will first have to download the Xmahjongg source code. 
You can get this from the Xmahjongg project page at www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg. 
Download the tarball xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz or a newer version if there is one. 
Do not download any of the other file types available on that page. 
If you prefer, you can instead download the Xmahjongg tarball by using 
the wget command that you learned in Chapter 8. Just open a Terminal 
window, type the following command, and then press ENTER.
wget http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz
Once you have the file on your hard disk, untar the xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz 
file either via the command line, as you learned to do in Chapter 8, or via the 
simple double-click method. To make it easier for you to follow along with 
the directions I’ll be giving you, be sure to place the untarred Xmahjongg 
folder in your home folder. Then you will be ready to roll.
Normally at this point, you would look through the folder to find some 
instructions for dealing with the package, just as you did in Chapter 8 for 
Briscola. In most source code packages, this information is included in an 
INSTALL file like that in the xmahjongg-3.7 folder (Figure 9-2). To read 
the INSTALL file, just double-click it, and it will open in Gedit.
In this case, you can simply close the INSTALL file, as it prescribes the 
same steps as I’ve listed below. However, in the future, when you install other 
programs from source, you will need to follow the instructions in the INSTALL 
files that come with the source files for those programs. With most INSTALL 
files, the instructions will match those that follow, though I would suggest 
using the alternative method I’ll be presenting as a substitute for the make 
install step. 
Of course, it may well occur that you take a look at the contents of the 
INSTALL file and start wondering what alien tongue it is written in. In such 
cases when you have no idea what the INSTALL file is going on about, which 
sometimes happens, just look for a configure file in the package folder. If 
you find one, then just try doing things the way you will learn in this project.

154
Chapter 9
Figure 9-2: Identifying a package’s INSTALL file
9A-2: Running configure and make for Xmahjongg
Now that you have downloaded and untarred the Xmahjongg tarball, 
installation is pretty standard, though we will be finishing up in a slightly 
different way. Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Open a Terminal window, and then move into the new folder by typing 
cd xmahjongg* and pressing ENTER.
The next step is sort of a setup phase that runs the configure script in the 
xmahjongg-3.7 folder. The configure script checks what files, compilers, and 
other things it needs, and then it searches your computer to see if those things 
are there, and if so, where. Based on this information, it writes a file called a 
makefile, which is a set of instructions that will tell the make command in the 
subsequent step how to set things up specifically for your system configuration.
2.
Configure the program by typing ./configure and pressing ENTER.
While you are running configure, you will see lots of odd and mysterious 
things flowing through your Terminal window; this is essentially a running 
account of what is going on, each step of the way. Depending on the program 
you are dealing with, this could take a bit of time—a few seconds or a few 
minutes. Either way, you needn’t worry. As long as the mysterious text keeps 
flowing and you don’t get an error message at the very end of the whole 
process, all will be well. 

Dining on Tarballs, Binaries, Java, and Even RPMs
155
When configure has done its thing, you will see your prompt again, and 
you can go on to the next step, which is the translation, or compilation, step. 
The make command reads the makefile, created by configure, to see how 
things need to be set up on your machine. Then it proceeds to call on the 
compiler to translate the high-level source code into low-level, machine-
readable files that can be installed in the subsequent step. 
3.
To perform this translation, type make, and press ENTER.
Again, you will be treated to more mysterious text flowing through the 
window and a short wait, usually a tad longer than for the configure process. 
Once make has done its job and you see your prompt again, you are ready to 
install the program. 
Up to this point, you have not changed your system in any way. All the 
changes thus far have taken place in the xmahjongg-3.7 folder only. Your 
system is still as pure as the day you started. Of course, all that is going to 
end right now when you perform the final installation step.
9A-3: Installing Xmahjongg
Normally at this point of the process, you would type sudo make install
and press ENTER, after which the files that were compiled in the make step 
would be installed in various locations throughout your system. You would 
then follow this up with the make clean command to tidy things up in the 
Xmahjongg folder by getting rid of any unnecessary files. 
This traditional approach works fine enough, but things can get a bit 
messy if you find yourself wanting to upgrade or remove the application later 
on, as you have to keep track of where everything is and remove each item 
piece by piece using a series of sudo rm commands. Sometimes an application 
package will provide a make uninstall routine, but such routines don’t always 
work perfectly, aren’t available for every package, and require you to keep the 
project folder on your hard disk in order for you to perform the procedure.
If you are a traditionalist, you can go ahead and install Xmahjongg in 
this traditional manner. In the same Terminal window that you performed 
the ./configure and make steps, just type sudo make install, and then press 
ENTER. You will be prompted for your password, so type it, and then press 
ENTER again. Xmahjongg will then be installed and ready for use.
The Alternative Installation Method
The traditional installation step is fine enough, but because of the limitations 
I mentioned in terms of removing the application, I recommend finishing 
things off in a slightly different way. What you are going to do, assuming you 
are willing to go this route, is to skip the make install step and instead convert 
the compiled, but uninstalled, application into a DEB package, and then 
install that. By doing this, you can remove the package quite easily using 
Synaptic whenever the desire strikes. Having a DEB package for your appli-
cation, you don’t need to keep the project folder, and you can save on hard 
disk clutter. 

156
Chapter 9
To create and install the DEB package, here’s what you need to do:
1.
Assuming you are using the still-open Terminal window in which you 
entered the make command, type sudo checkinstall, and then press 
ENTER.
2.
A message will soon appear in the Terminal telling you that the ./doc-pak 
directory does not exist, and asking you if the program should create it. 
You want it to, so type Y, and press ENTER.
3.
The checkinstall program will then begin performing a mock install, 
after which it will create the DEB package. Before completing the pro-
cess it will ask you for a description of the package. Type something like 
An easy-to-see Mahjongg game, press ENTER, and then press ENTER again.
4.
You will then be presented with a screen, such as that in Figure 9-3, giv-
ing you the chance to change the package information. You don’t need 
to change anything, so just press ENTER.
Figure 9-3: Accepting checkinstall’s default package information
5.
The checkinstall program will then finish up the packaging of the DEB 
package, install it, and then let you know when it is done.
And that is that. The Xmahjongg game is now installed on your system, 
and you will find an Xmahjongg DEB package within the Xmahjongg folder. 
You should move that DEB package to a safe place, such as a Tarballs or Soft-
ware folder (or whatever else you choose to call it) so that you can use it again 
should you someday need to reinstall your system. Once you’ve moved the 
DEB package, dump the Xmahjongg folder, assuming it is in your home 
folder, by typing cd ; sudo rm -r xmahjongg* and pressing ENTER.

NOTE
The semicolon, surrounded by spaces on either side, is used to separate commands 
written on a single line. In following the directions just given, you are really perform-
ing two operations in a single line: cd and sudo rm –r xmahjongg*.
9A-4: Running Xmahjongg
As a general rule, programs compiled from source do not automatically 
install a launcher in your Applications menu; you must instead run them 
by command. Although you can run a program for the first time by typing 
a command in the Run Application panel applet, it is better to run the 
program for the first time by typing the command in your Terminal window. 
If anything has gone amiss during installation, the Terminal will tell you 
what the problem is, whereas the Run Program method would just leave 
you wondering what’s going on. 
To run Xmahjongg, just type xmahjongg in a Terminal window, and then 
press ENTER. If everything goes as it should, you can create a program launcher 
for Xmahjongg in your Applications menu, on the GNOME Panel, or in a 
panel drawer.
As you already know, Ubuntu is a Debian-based system, which means that 
most applications available for it, such as those you install via Synaptic, come 
in DEB packages. Other systems, such as Mandriva and Fedora Core, how-
ever, are RPM based, which is the program packaging system developed by 
Red Hat. It is possible, in many cases, to use RPMs in Debian-based systems 
by converting the RPMs to DEB packages. In this project, we are going to be 
doing just that in order to install the very handy Internet telephony applica-
tion Skype.
Skype, shown in Figure 9-4, is Voice-over-IP (VoIP) software that allows you 
to speak to other Skype users over the Internet with the clarity of a regular 
telephone line, and it doesn’t cost anything—even if you call users overseas. 
There are also for-fee services, such as Skype Out, which allows you to call 
regular mobile and land line telephone numbers from your computer at a 
fraction of what it would normally cost you to do so from a regular telephone.
While it is true that Ubuntu comes bundled with a VoIP package of its 
own, called Ekiga Softphone, it is not compatible with the much-better-known 
and more widespread Skype. Since it is very likely that the majority of people 
you know who are using a VoIP software package are using Skype, it only 
makes sense to go the Skype route so that you can easily communicate with 
them. It’s nice software anyway.

Debian-Based System: Skype

Figure 9-4: Internet telephony made 
easy with Skype
9B-1: Installing Alien
Before downloading, converting, and installing the Skype RPM, you have 
to first install Alien, which is the application that allows you to perform the 
conversion. Fortunately, Alien is available via Synaptic, so all you have to 
do is perform a search for alien, and then follow the standard installation 
procedures, making sure that you have met all the necessary dependencies 
for the application you are going to install. If you don’t know beforehand 
what those dependencies are, you will find out when you try to install the 
file; a list of unmet dependencies will then appear.
9B-2: Getting the Skype RPM
Once Alien is installed, you need to download the Skype RPM. You can get this 
from www.skype.com/download/skype/linux. On that page, click RPM for 
Mandriva 10.1 and newer. There are other versions on the page that might 
work, but there are more problems involved in dealing with them. 
Once the download is complete, make sure to place the RPM in your 
home folder.
9B-3: Converting the Skype RPM
Now that the Skype RPM is in your home folder, you can convert it to an 
Ubuntu-friendly DEB package using Alien by typing the following command 
and pressing ENTER:
sudo alien –d skype*.rpm

Dining on Tarballs, Binaries, Java, and Even RPMs
159
After typing your password when prompted to do so, nothing much will 
seem to happen. Once Alien is done doing its thing, however, you will get the 
message skype_1.2.0.21-2_i386.deb generated (or something like that) in the 
Terminal window. If you look in your home folder you will then find the 
newly generated DEB package along with the original RPM.
9B-4: Installing Dependencies
Before going on to install the Skype DEB package, you need to install a 
library upon which it depends: libqt3-mt. Fortunately, you can get this 
easily enough via Synaptic by doing a Synaptic search for libqt3-mt and 
then installing the file. 
9B-5: Installing the Newly Generated Skype DEB Package
You can now install the newly generated Skype DEB package by using the 
dpkg (Debian package) command with the -i (install) flag, and then pressing 
ENTER. The command should be:
sudo dpkg -i skype*.deb
If I haven’t won you over to the world of commands (not that I’m 
trying to), and you still prefer going about things graphically whenever 
possible, you will be happy to know that you can install a DEB package 
by simply double-clicking the file in question. Doing so will bring up the 
Gdebi Package Installer window (Figure 9-5). 
Figure 9-5: Installing individual DEB packages graphically
In that window, click the Install Package button, and a new window will 
appear telling you that you need to grant administrative rights in order to 
install the package. Click the Grant button, and you will be prompted for 
your password before installation of the package will begin. When the 

160
Chapter 9
process is done, you will be notified in the installation progress window. 
Just click Close in that window, and the process is done. You can then close 
the Package Installer window as well.
9B-6: Running Skype
Once all the pieces have been installed, you can run Skype by going to the 
Applications menu and selecting Internet Skype. After setting up a Skype 
user account, I would advise restarting your computer. Skype seems to work 
better in terms of sound quality after that initial restart. Also remember, while 
on the topic of sound quality, that it is best to use Skype with a headset. Trying 
to talk with a stick microphone could cause feedback or echoes because the 
microphone will pick up sounds from the speakers and transmit them.
Applications that are compiled and can be run as-is by your operating system 
are called binaries. When you compiled Xmahjongg from source code, you 
were in essence creating a binary for the application that you later installed. 
DEB packages and RPMs are essentially precompiled binaries with a built-in 
installation mechanism. 
There are, however, quite a few other programs that come in binary 
form but are not DEB packages or RPMs. Instead, they come as tarballs, 
and, once extracted, can be run either locally from within your home 
folder or, with a just a bit more work on your part, globally. 
Such binary packages come in two flavors, so to speak: dynamic and 
static. Dynamic binaries are dependent on other libraries and bits of software 
installed on your system. If you don’t have the dependencies installed, you 
can’t run the application, or at least not with all of its functions. Static binaries,
on the other hand, don’t depend on anything else in your system, as they 
come with everything they need to run. Of course, such convenience comes 
at a price, because the size of a static binary package is usually considerably 
greater than that for a dynamic binary package. That means longer download 
times and more used disk space for you.
G-Sudoku
In this project you will be working with a dynamic binary package called 
G-Sudoku (Figure 9-6), which is a sudoku game generator and solver. It 
depends on GTK, a widget library used by many applications in the creation 
of their user interface. Since GTK is present in just about every Linux distri-
bution out there, G-Sudoku should run right out of the box, as they say.

Figure 9-6: G-Sudoku
9C-1: Getting the G-Sudoku Tarball
To start out, you will first need to download the G-Sudoku tarball, which you 
can easily do by going to www.yzonesoft.com/gsudoku/gsudoku.html and 
clicking the Downloads link. On the Downloads page, go down to the Linux 
section, and download the file listed there (tar.gz.file is all it says). If you prefer 
to go the wget route that you learned about in Chapter 8, you can instead 
open a Terminal window, type the following command string, and then press 
ENTER to download the tarball.
wget http://www.yzonesoft.com/gsudoku/files/gsudoku_02_linux.tar.gz
Either way you go, once the G-Sudoku tarball is on your hard disk, 
extract it via the command line or the double-click method, and then make 
sure to place the application folder in your home folder. 
9C-2: Running G-Sudoku
You can run G-Sudoku in one of two ways. You can either double-click 
the G-Sudoku binary file itself to launch it (the icon looks like a lavender 
diamond), or you can open a Terminal window, type the following command, 
and press ENTER:
cd gsudoku* ; ./gsudoku

162
Chapter 9
G-Sudoku is an open source application, but it wasn’t always. In the 
past, you had to pay for G-Sudoku, which might explain why when you start 
it up there is a small, though not unattractive splash screen (splash window, 
actually) that appears, announcing that the application is sponsored by 
Raja Tea. Strangely, that splash screen actually causes a few problems, 
because if you close it too soon, you can inadvertently close the whole 
program. 
To avoid this problem in the future, go to the Settings menu, and select 
Settings. When the Settings Dialog window appears, click Preference in the 
left pane, and then deselect Show splash screen at start up. There is no OK 
button in the window, so just close it to save the changes. 
When you are ready to play, just click the New button in the main 
window, and G-Sudoku will generate a new game for you to play.
9C-3: Moving G-Sudoku to a Global Location
If you would like to move G-Sudoku to a global location so that everyone who 
has a user account on your machine can play it (or so that you don’t toss it 
out by accident), you can do so in the same manner you did with Briscola in 
Chapter 8. 
First, shorten the name of the G-Sudoku folder from gsudoku_02_linux to 
gsudoku. After that, just type the following command, and press ENTER:
sudo mv gsudoku  /usr/share/games
Because you used the sudo command, you will be prompted for your 
password, so type it, press ENTER, and the job will be done.
9C-4: Creating a Launchable Link for G-Sudoku
With G-Sudoku in its new global location, running it is a bit more tiring on 
the fingertips, as you must now type /usr/share/games/gsudoku/gsudoku in order 
to run it. Well, to make things much easier, we can create a link in one of the 
directories within the system’s command search path. This is the same thing 
we did for Briscola in Chapter 8.
To create the link for G-Sudoku, here’s what you need to do:
1.
In the Terminal, type cd /usr/games, and press ENTER.
2.
Create the link by typing sudo ln -s /usr/share/games/gsudoku/gsudoku, and 
press ENTER.
3.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
You can now run G-Sudoku by typing gsudoku in the Terminal or Run 
Application panel applet and pressing ENTER.

In Chapter 8 you learned to run a couple of applications based on scripts, 
such as the Python-based pyWings and the Tcl/Tk–based Briscola, but it just 
wouldn’t be right to finish up our discussion of applications without men-
tioning what might be well considered the granddaddy of all scripting 
languages—Java. In this project, you will learn how to install the Java Runtime 
Environment and how to install and run the Java-based version of the classic 
board game, Risk.
9D-1: Installing the Java Runtime Environment
In order to run Java-based applications, or scripts, you need to first install the 
Java Runtime Environment. This is easily done via Synaptic by doing a search 
for j2re. When the search is complete, mark the file j2re1.4 for installation, 
and if you want to also install the browser plugin at the same time, mark 
j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin, as well. After that, go through the usual steps for 
installing a package via Synaptic. During the installation process, a small 
window will appear (Figure 9-7), spelling out the license terms for the package. 
Check the box next to the words Do you agree with the above license terms (don’t 
be bothered by the fact that the terms are actually listed below), and then 
click the Forward button to get back to the installation.
Figure 9-7: Agreeing to the Java Runtime Environment licensing terms
9D-2: Getting the Risk File
Risk, as well as many other Java-based applications, is available from 
www.sourceforge.net, but to make things easier, just point your browser 
directly to the Risk project home page at http://jrisk.sourceforge.net (and 
don’t forget the j at the beginning of that URL). On the main page, click the 
Download link. Then, on the Downloads page, click the Risk jar and source
link. You will then be taken to a page of download locations, so click the one 
closest to you, and wait for your download to begin.
Project 9D: Running Java Apps: Risk

164
Chapter 9
Risk comes as a Zip archive, so once the download is complete, you will 
have to unzip the file using one of the methods you’ve learned thus far. 
Once you’re finished, you will have a new Risk folder within your home 
folder. If you take a look in that folder, you will notice the file Risk.jar. This 
is the game that you will be running via the command line. In the future, 
should you choose to download other Java-based applications, the file with 
the .jar extension will be the one you will be trying to run.
9D-3: Running Risk
Now that you’ve installed the Java Runtime Environment and downloaded 
and extracted the Risk Zip file, you are ready to run Risk without any further 
work. To get going, open a new Terminal window, and do the following:
1.
Move into the Risk folder by typing cd Risk and pressing ENTER.
2.
Type java –jar Risk.jar (be sure to place a space between java and –jar), 
and press ENTER. Risk (shown in Figure 9-8) will soon appear, after which 
you can start playing.
Figure 9-8: Risk
In case you’re wondering, here’s what you did in that last line: The first 
part of the command string, java, calls the Java Runtime Environment into 
action; the –jar flag after that tells Java that you are going to be running a 
JAR file; and the last part is the actual file you are going to run, Risk.jar. In 
the future, if you choose to run other Java-based applications, just follow the 
same pattern: java –jar application_name.jar.

Running Windows Applications with Wine
Now that you’ve learned just about every way there is to add applications to 
your system, I might as well throw in one more—running Windows applica-
tions. Despite the fact that there is a Linux equivalent to most of the Windows 
programs that people use or need, there may be one or two programs that you 
will come to miss. For me it has long been the freeware version of the Austrian 
card game Schnapsen. Fortunately, it is possible to run some Windows applica-
tions from within Linux with the help of a program called Wine.
The folks at Wine seem keen on pointing out that Wine is not a Windows 
emulator, preferring to call it a Windows compatibility layer. In fact, even the 
name itself drives home the point, as Wine is a recursive acronym for Wine Is 
Not an Emulator. Whatever way you choose to look at it, its function is to allow 
you to run Windows apps without having Windows installed on your machine. 
It is only fair to point out that Wine continues to be a work in progress. 
It works fairly well with some programs and not at all with others. Things 
have improved, however, and Wine now seems to work better with more 
applications. Until the latest release, for example, I had been unable to get 
my beloved Schnapsen game to run. Now it does, and pretty well at that 
(Figure 9-9). 
Figure 9-9: A Windows application (Schnapsen) running under Linux
If you are curious as to which apps are known to run under Wine, and 
to what degree of success, check out the Wine home page at www.winehq.org, 
and click the AppDB link. And if you are curious about Schnapsen and 
aren’t afraid of wading through a bit of German, get the program at 
www.members.a1.net/zillinger. You can also learn the rules of Schnapsen 
(and any other card game in the world) at www.pagat.com.

Chapter 9
Installing Wine
It is possible to install Wine via Synaptic from the repositories you have 
already activated thus far. Unfortunately, the version available there (as of 
this writing, anyway) has some quirks that make it an undesirable choice. 
Instead, it is better to add WineHQ’s repository to your Synaptic repository 
list, just as in the example given in Chapter 5, before downloading and 
installing Wine. Just remember that the APT line you want to add to the 
repository list is: 
deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main
After you have added the repository and reloaded the package lists, 
perform a search for wine, and then mark and install it.
Setting Up Wine
Once Wine is installed, you will need to allow it to create a fake Windows 
C: drive within your home folder. One way to do this is by running the Wine 
configuration manager, Winecfg, even though you don’t really need to do 
any configuring at this point in the game. 
The first time around, it is probably best to run Winecfg via the command 
Terminal so that you can see evidence in the Terminal ouput that Wine is 
indeed creating your fake C: drive. Just type winecfg, and press ENTER. Wine 
will then create the fake C: drive, after which Winecfg (Figure 9-10) will 
appear. As I said, you don’t need to configure anything at this point, so you 
can have a look at Winecfg and then close it. In the future, you might want to 
check out the online documentation at www.winehq.org.

Installing a Windows Application in Wine
To get a feel for how you can go about installing a Windows application to 
use under Wine, I will point you to one that will definitely work—a pretty 
cool tabbed text editor called NoteTab Light (Figure 9-11).
-
Figure 9-11: NoteTab Light
To get NoteTab Light, go to www.notetab.com, and click the EXE 
Package button in the NoteTab Light 4.95 section. Firefox will then launch 
a window asking you what you want to do with the file. Accept the default, 
Open with Wine, by clicking OK. A few moments after that, the same setup 
wizard that you would see if you were installing NoteTab Light in Windows 
will appear (Figure 9-12). Go through that wizard, accepting all the defaults 
along the way, until the installation is complete. 
Figure 9-12: A Windows installation wizard running 
under Wine

168
Chapter 9
If the Open with Wine option does not appear, select Save to Disk in 
Firefox’s what-do-I-do-with-this window, and click OK. When the download 
is complete, place the NoteTab Light EXE file in your home folder, open a 
Terminal window, type wine NoteTab_Setup.exe in that window, and press ENTER.
NOTE
If you are trying to install an application that comes in a Zip archive, you must first 
download the file, extract it, and then run the setup wizard yourself. You can do this 
via a Terminal window by using the cd command to move into the folder, and then 
typing wine plus the name of the setup file within the application folder, usually 
wine setup.exe.
Running a Windows Application in Wine
Running NoteTab Light is quite easy because it provides you with a desktop 
launcher. Just double-click that launcher, and NoteTab Light will soon appear, 
just like a regular Linux app would. In other cases, however, you won’t be as 
lucky because there might not be an easy-to-find launcher. In such cases you 
can use Wine File, which you can run via the Run Application panel applet. 
Just type winefile, press Run, and a Windows Explorer–like file browser will 
appear (Figure 9-13).
Figure 9-13: Searching your “C:” drive with Wine File
Wine File as is will show the contents of your entire hard disk, not just 
your fake C: drive. This can be a bit unwieldy to deal with, so it is probably 
best to click the C:/ button, which will open another subwindow displaying 
only the content of that fake drive—your Wineland, so to speak. In that 
window, you can then double-click the Program Files directory, and from 
there, navigate to the app you want to run, and then double-click that app’s 
EXE file in order to do so.

Setting Up and Using Your Printer and Scanner
Two of the most common computer 
peripherals are printers and scanners. 
This only makes sense, as it is those two 
tools that turn a web-surfing, game-playing, 
music-churning, number-crunching box of chips into 
a meaningful production tool—a virtual publishing 
house, if you will. These two tools help your computer convert digital infor-
mation into hard copy (in the case of printers) and hard copy into digital 
information (in the case of scanners). It is not surprising, therefore, that 
these tools often come together these days in the form of multifunction 
printers. 
In this chapter, you will learn how to connect these useful devices to 
your computer, how to set them up, and how to use them. If you’re more 
into working with your digital camera than with a scanner, you might want 
to sneak a peek at Chapter 14; otherwise, put on your printer’s smock, and 
follow on. . . .

170
Chapter 10
Printers
Unless the only thing you use your computer for is playing games, listening 
to MP3s, or stopping doors on hot, breezy days, you will no doubt want to 
hook up your machine to a printer. Despite the paperless office era that the 
personal computer was supposedly going to usher in, it seems that the com-
puter’s strength as a desktop-publishing and general work tool has made 
producing high-quality printed documents an even more attractive proposi-
tion than ever before. 
Confirming That Your Printer Is Supported
Setting up a printer to work with your new system is a pretty easy task, but you 
do have to make sure that your printer is supported by Linux. Fortunately, it 
seems that printer support in the Linux world is getting much, much better 
than it once was. In general, support for Epson, Brother, Samsung, and 
Hewlett-Packard printers is pretty good, while support for other makers and 
other printer types is a bit spottier, though improving. 
If you really want to make sure your printer is supported (and why 
wouldn’t you?), the best thing to do is go to www.linuxprinting.org. On that 
site, you can check out the online database to see if your printer is currently 
supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for supported printers also 
include information on what drivers are best for your purposes. If you’re 
thinking of buying a printer, there is also a page of suggested makes and 
models. Read this before making your purchase decision. You might also 
want to consult Ubuntu’s list at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport-
ComponentsPrinters.
Setting Up Your Printer
If you have a USB printer, get started by connecting it to your computer and 
then powering up the printer. If your printer connects to your computer’s 
parallel port, you will first have to turn your computer off, connect your 
printer to the computer, turn on the printer, and then start your computer. 
Of course, if your printer was connected and on during installation, you can 
skip this step. Either way, your printer should be detected, though you won’t 
get one of those immediate new-hardware-found alerts that you do in 
Windows. 
Once your system has restarted, here is what you need to do:
1.
Go to the System menu, and select Administration Printing.
2.
A Printers window will appear, showing a printer icon with the name 
New Printer. Double-click that icon, after which a setup wizard will appear 
(Figure 10-1). 
The name of your printer should appear in the pane below the words 
Use a detected printer, due to the wonders of plug and play (which means 
that your printers, scanners, and other devices can tell your computer 
what they are). Unfortunately, just because your system knows which 

Gutenbird
171
printer you have hooked up to it hardware-wise doesn’t actually mean 
it can communicate with that printer in terms of printing (ditto for 
Windows and Mac OS X). That’s what drivers are for. 
Figure 10-1: The printer setup wizard 
3.
Continue by clicking the Forward button, which will take you to the 
second page of the wizard, shown in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2: Selecting the make and model of the printer in the printer 
setup wizard

172
Chapter 10
This second page of the wizard should automatically open with the 
make and model of your printer selected, as well as the recommended 
driver for that printer. If the model chosen is not correct, scroll down 
the list until you find the correct model. If your model isn’t listed, try the 
one that was selected by default. 
4.
Once your printer is selected, click the Forward button, which will bring 
you to the last page of the wizard.
5.
On this page, type a name for your printer, and, if you want, give a descrip-
tion and its location. When you’re finished, your window should look 
something like mine in Figure 10-3. You can then click Apply.
Figure 10-3: The final page of the printer setup wizard
The wizard should close, leaving you at the Printers window where 
you started this quest. An icon for your printer should now appear in 
that window alongside the New Printer icon that you originally found 
there. If you have set up more than one printer, you can choose which 
one you would like to be the default by right-clicking the icon for that 
printer and selecting Make Default in the menu that appears. The icon 
for that printer should then be emblazoned with a blue checkbox 
(Figure 10-4), indicating that it is the default printer for your system.

Your printer is now set up and ready for use. However, just to make sure 
that everything is hunky-dory, it is always a good idea to print a test page. 
1.
Right-click the icon for your printer in the Printers window, and select 
Properties in the popup menu.
2.
In the Properties window that appears, click the Print a Test Page button. 
Your system will send a test document to your printer and let you know 
it’s done so in a small window, which you can close. The printer should print 
out the test document shortly. 
NOTE
If your test page didn’t come out the way it should, or if your printer wasn’t configured 
automatically or correctly by the system, check out www.linuxprinting.org, and see if 
there are any special requirements or caveats for your model.
For the Driverless Among You
As I mentioned, there are some printers for which Linux does not yet have 
built-in support. For those of you who find yourselves with such printers, 
there are a few routes you can take in order to get things to work. 
Checking the Connections
You’d be surprised how many times I have triumphantly solved someone’s 
printer problems by simply wiggling or replugging their USB or parallel con-
nectors. Loose connections are often the culprit when your printer’s model 
name fails to appear in the first page of the printer setup wizard. 
If that approach fails, browse to www.linuxprinting.org, as it is sometimes 
the case that Linux can only support certain printers if they are connected 
via the parallel port, even if they work via USB in other systems.
Third-Party Drivers
Recently, more and more Linux printing drivers are becoming available. If 
you don’t find your printer on that second page of the printer setup wizard, 
just trying Googling the make and model of your printer plus the word linux.
In my case, having a Samsung SCX4100 laser printer that did not appear at 
www.linuxprinting.org, I searched for samsung+SCX4100+linux.
This led me to www.driverstock.com, which provides free printer drivers 
for most operating systems, including Linux. On that site, I found not only 
the driver for my printer, but also the driver for its built-in scanner. 
You might also want to check the website for the manufacturer of your 
printer, as many now provide Linux drivers for a number of their printers. 
Brother, Lexmark, Hewlett-Packard, and Samsung do, to name a few. Canon 
seems to be the main holdout as far as the big boys go. There is also a German 
company (www.turboprint.info) that provides Linux drivers, albeit for a fee, 
for machines that are really hard to deal with and for high-quality graphic 
solutions.

174
Chapter 10
If you happen to find and download a driver for your printer that does 
not come with its own installer (the driver file should end in .ppd), go back to 
the printer setup wizard, click the Install Driver button on the second page, 
and then navigate to the driver file you downloaded. 
Don’t forget to give the Ubuntu forums (www.ubuntuforums.org) a try 
to see if anyone there has any experience getting the printer in question to 
work on their system.
Trial and Error
Finally, there is always the old trial-and-error approach, which works on 
occasion. When setting up your printer via the wizard window, try selecting 
Generic PostScript Printer, which works with some machines. If that fails, 
try choosing from one of the other models and/or drivers available for 
printers from your printer’s manufacturer. 
After you are done with the wizard, open the Preferences window for the 
printer you added, click the Print a Test Page button, and see what happens. 
If nothing happens, click the Driver tab, select a different printer model, 
and then press the Print a Test Page button again. Repeat that process until 
something works. With any luck, something will . . . might . . . well, just give it 
a try if you’re desperate. 
Printing Details
Now that your printer is set up, you will no doubt want to start printing. This 
is an easy task and not much different from how it works in the Windows and 
Mac worlds, so you will need little explanation in this regard. There are a few 
points of difference, however, so I will touch upon these.
Printing to PDF
One of the nice features of Linux is that you can save most documents as 
PDF files. In some cases, such as in OpenOffice.org, you do this by exporting 
the document to PDF. In most other applications, however, you do it via the 
Print dialog box, in which case you are said to be “printing to PDF.” Whether 
you are saving to PDF, exporting to PDF, or printing to PDF, you are essentially 
doing the same thing: creating a PDF file of your document. 
This is very handy, as it allows you to create documents that cannot be 
altered by others and yet can easily be read regardless of what word processor 
program or computer platform the reader is using. Best of all, this feature, 
which you would have to pay a pretty penny for in the Windows world, costs 
you nothing, as it is built in to your system.
In most GNOME applications, you can print to PDF by going to the File
menu of the application in question and selecting Print. When the Print 
window (Figure 10-5) appears, select Create a PDF document in the Printer 
pane, and then click the Print button.

Gutenbird
175
Figure 10-5: Printing a file to PDF in most GNOME applications
Printing Web Pages to PDF
Printing to PDF is also a very handy way of saving a web page that you would 
like to keep on hand in its graphical entirety for future reference. At this 
time, Firefox does not support this feature, though it does allow you to print 
a page to PostScript. As long as you are strictly using the file on your own 
system or giving it to someone else with a Linux system, you most likely won’t 
notice any difference between PS and PDF files, as they look and act pretty 
much the same.
To print a web page to PostScript, go to the Firefox File menu, and select 
Print. When the Print dialog window appears, select Print to file, and then 
give your file a name, being sure to keep the .ps file ending. Click Print, and 
within seconds, the file will appear on your hard disk.
This is all fine and dandy, but if you want to distribute the document 
to a broader audience, the PostScript alternative just won’t do, as most 
Windows users won’t have any way to view the file. So what can you do? Well, 
one way is to create the PS document and then convert it to PDF using the 
ps2pdf command. This is very easy to do, though it doesn’t always work so 
well. You may find, for example, that the text within your PS document 
vanishes in the output PDF file, or that the text appears, while the graphics 
vanish. Giving it a try can’t hurt, though, so here’s how you do it. Just type 
ps2pdf filename.ps filename.pdf in your Terminal, and press ENTER. Yup, that’s 
all there is to it.
If you aren’t satisfied with the results of a ps2pdf conversion, but you still want 
to be able to print web pages to PDF, there is a fairly simple solution—create 
a virtual PDF printer. By doing so, you will be able to print to PDF in any 
application that allows printing (sorry gamers).
Project 10: Creating a Virtual PDF Printer

Chapter 10
10-1: Getting and Setting Up the Files You Need
To get started, run Synaptic, perform a search for cups-pdf, and install it. 
Once it is installed, open a Terminal window, type sudo chmod +s /usr/lib/
cups/backend/cups-pdf, and press ENTER. When prompted for your password, 
type it, and press ENTER.
10-2: Setting Up Your Virtual PDF Printer
After the cups-PDF installation and preparation is complete, you can go on 
to setting up your printer. To do this, go to the System menu, and select 
Administration Printing. Provide your password when prompted, and then, 
when the Printers window appears, double-click the New Printer icon. In the 
Add a Printer wizard that appears, select Local Printer and Use a detected 
printer, and then click once on PDF Printer to select it. Once you’re done, 
click Forward.
On the second page of the wizard, select Generic in the Manufacturer 
menu, and then select postscript color printer rev3b in the Model section. 
Your window should then look like that in Figure 10-6. If it does, click 
Forward.
Figure 10-6: Creating a virtual PDF printer
Finally, on the last page of the wizard, fill in the text boxes as you like 
and click Apply to seal the deal. You might want to shorten the name of the 
printer to something more manageable, such as My PDF Printer.

Gutenbird
177
10-3: Using Your Virtual PDF Printer
Once you’ve set up your virtual PDF printer, you can use it quite easily. In 
fact, because your system views it as a real printer, all you have to do is go 
through the usual steps for printing any document, but just be sure to select 
your virtual PDF printer as the printer for the job in the Print dialog window 
when it appears. 
Once you’ve printed a document using the virtual PDF printer, you can 
find your documents in the PDF folder that cups-PDF will create for you 
within your home folder the first time you use the virtual PDF printer.
Canceling a Print Job
It happens to all of us. You wanted to print just 1 page of a 57-page docu-
ment, but you accidentally started printing the whole thing. What can you do 
to save your ink and 56 sheets of paper? Fortunately, the solution is simple. 
Once you’ve clicked the Print button and the print job is sent to your 
printer, a small printer icon will appear somewhere at the right end of the 
top GNOME Panel (usually to the left of the other items there), as you can 
see in Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7: A printer icon appears 
in the GNOME Panel while printing.
Just click that icon once, and a window showing your current and 
queued print jobs will appear (as shown in Figure 10-8). Your errant print 
job will be listed in that window, so click the name of the job to select it, and 
then, in the Edit menu, select Cancel Jobs. If you just want to stop things 
temporarily, you can select Pause Jobs instead.
Figure 10-8: Canceling a print job via the print queue 
window
After you do this, the print job listed in the queue window will disappear, 
and your printer will stop printing. You can then close the print queue 
window. This is a very easy process that you may well find is more effective 
than what you’ve experienced in other operating systems.
In some cases, things will be even easier, particularly if you installed 
your printer driver yourself by means of the installer that came packaged 
with the driver. In many such cases, the driver will provide its own progress 

178
Chapter 10
window that will appear whenever you print a document. If so, you can 
simply click the Cancel button (or equivalent) in that window to cancel 
the printing job.
NOTE
In some cases you may have to clear your printer after canceling a print job. You can do 
this by turning your printer off, waiting a few seconds, and then turning it on again.
Scanners
Scanners are extremely useful and about as cheap a peripheral device as 
you can get. They allow you to take images or pages of text and input them, 
in digital form, into your computer—in much the same way as you would 
duplicate a document on a copy machine. However, even as digital cameras 
are rapidly overtaking traditional film cameras as the photographic device 
of choice for the masses, the number of people using scanners to transfer 
their non-digital images into digital form is slowly decreasing. 
Despite this trend, scanners are not in immediate danger of extinction 
because there are more images around than those you photograph yourself. 
In some ways, you could even argue that scanners are becoming a bit more 
common due to the fact that they now often come as part of the increasingly 
popular multifunction printers.
Even though scanners have been around for a relatively long time, 
support for them in Linux is still a bit spotty. Fortunately, this is changing 
for the better with every new Linux release. The back end, the essentially 
hidden part of your system that handles scanner recognition and support 
in Linux, is called Sane, while the graphical interface for Sane is called 
XSane (shown in Figure 10-9). If you are wondering whether Linux will 
be able to recognize your scanner, or if you are trying to figure out what 
type of scanner to buy, you will probably want to go to the Sane website, 
www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html. 
Figure 10-9: Scanning with XSane

Gutenbird
179
There you will be able to see whether your scanner is supported or get 
tips about what scanner to buy. As I have mentioned before, you can also try 
out the Ubuntu forums (www.ubuntuforums.org) and ask for Ubuntu-
specific recommendations there. 
Scanning with XSane
To run XSane, go to the Applications menu, and select Graphics XSane 
Image scanning program. XSane will then perform a search for an attached 
scanner. If it finds one, it will start up. If it doesn’t, it will pop up a tiny 
window that says, “No devices available.” You can do little else at that point 
other than click the Close button. 
If you do run up against this problem, you can try running XSane as 
root by going to the Applications menu and selecting System Tools Run 
as different user. When the Run program window appears, type xsane in 
the Run box, and then press the OK button. If your stars are in alignment, 
XSane should detect your scanner, pop up a message that it is dangerous 
to run XSane as root, and then open up in its full multi-windowed glory. 
If your scanner still isn’t detected, a trip to www.sane-project.org or 
www.ubuntuforums.org might be in order to see if there are any known 
workarounds for your particular scanner model.
To actually scan something, place the photo, document, or whatever 
it is you are planning to scan on the scanner bed, and then click the 
Acquire preview button at the bottom-left corner of the XSane Preview 
window (which usually opens up at the right end of your screen). Once the 
preview appears, use the selection tools in the same window to define the 
exact area you want to scan, and then choose your resolution and color 
depth settings in the main XSane window (which usually opens up at the 
top left of your screen). When everything is ready, click the Scan button, 
after which your scanned image will appear in a new Viewer window (as 
shown in Figure 10-10).
In that window, you can perform some minor tweaks of the scanned 
image using the buttons and menu items provided, and then save the image 
by going to the File menu and selecting Save. If you scanned a document 
that you want to convert to text, click the second button from the left (the 
one that says ABCDEF), and you will also be able to save the file as a text 
document. 
NOTE
If you happened to download and install a driver for your scanner or multifunction 
printer from the device manufacturer’s site (or elsewhere), you may find yourself with 
another scanning application provided within the driver package. If you prefer, you 
can use that application instead of XSane to perform your scanning chores.

a separate Viewer window.
Why Are My Scanned Images So Big?
To wrap up this section on scanning (and, for that matter, this chapter), let 
me address a question that seems to confuse a lot of people. One of the first 
areas of confusion is that there is a general blurring of how the terms ppi
(pixels per inch) and dpi (dots per inch) are used. Most applications use these 
terms interchangeably, and yet they aren’t really the same thing. To make 
things simple, when you are talking about images on your screen, you are 
talking about pixels (the little squares that make up your screen image) per 
inch, and when you are talking about printer resolution, you are talking 
about dots (of printer ink) per inch. 
Your computer screen generally has a resolution of 76ppi, while most 
modern inkjet and laser printers have a resolution range of 300 to 1200dpi, 
or sometimes even more. This means that a photo scanned at 76ppi, which 
looks just fine on your screen, ends up looking pretty lame when you print it 
out. On the other hand, when you scan a picture at 300ppi, the image will 
look much better in your printout but will seem gigantic on your screen. This 
makes sense, as the resolution of your image is more than three times that 
of your computer screen’s resolution. The result is that your computer can 
accommodate the higher resolution of the image only by displaying that 
image at three times its original size.

Gutenbird
181
As an example, have a look at Figure 10-11, where you can see an 
identical image scanned at three different resolutions: 76ppi, 150ppi, 
and 300ppi. As you can see, the 76ppi image at the far left (measuring 
5 u 6 inches—about the size of the hard copy itself) is the smallest, while 
the other two images are proportionally bigger (about 10 u 12 inches 
for the 150ppi image and about 22 u 25 inches for the 300ppi image).
Figure 10-11: The same image scanned at three different resolutions
What Resolution Should I Use When Scanning? 
What resolution you use when scanning really depends on a variety of 
factors, the most important of which is what you plan to do with the image 
when you’re finished. When I look at Figure 10-11 on my computer screen, 
the smallest image looks best, the middle image looks okay, and the largest 
looks a bit odd, not as sharp as the other two. Basically, when scanning images 
for display on a computer—on web pages, for instance—it is probably best to 
stick with a ppi similar to typical screen resolutions or slightly larger: 76 to 
150ppi.
When it comes to printing, a whole new set of considerations comes 
into play. First of all, there are the limitations of your scanner, since different 
models have different maximum resolutions. The resolution limits of your 
printer itself are also, naturally enough, a major consideration. For example, 
laser printers and inkjet printers have different characteristics; laser printers 
will produce better-quality images than inkjet printers, while inkjet output will 
be more greatly affected by the type of paper used than a laser printer will be. 
Of course, your printed output is not going to suffer if you scan your images 
at higher resolutions than those at which you plan to print them out, but 
you will end up with a lot of files taking up too much disk space. Remember:
The higher the resolution of a scanned image, the greater the file size in terms of disk 
space. If this is of concern to you, you can simply resize the images after you’re 

182
Chapter 10
done printing using an application such as the GIMP (more on that in Chap-
ter 14), but if you would prefer not being so cavalier with your use of disk 
space from the get-go, you can follow these very general guidelines:
 If you are using a laser printer, scan at the same resolution at which you 
are going to print.
 If you are going to use an inkjet printer with photo-quality paper, scan at 
about 80 percent of your target printout resolution—about 240ppi for a 
300dpi printout. 
 If you are using an inkjet printer with regular paper, scan at about 
65 percent of your target printout resolution—about 195ppi for a 
300dpi printout.
Needless to say, these are just suggestions to get you started. What 
works best for you and your particular scanner/printer setup may be slightly 
different. Nothing works better than a bit of experimentation and trial and 
error. In this case, you can’t really go wrong. Just give yourself some time, 
don’t get frustrated, and, most importantly, don’t wait until you desperately 
need to scan something before trying things out—stay ahead of the game.

Adding New Fonts to Your System
There are basically two kinds of fonts: 
bitmap and outline. The difference between 
these two is essentially the same as that between 
bitmap and vector graphics, which I will talk more about 
in Chapter 14. Bitmap characters are stored as a map 
of dots—the bitmap. The main limitation of bitmaps is
that they only look good at the size and resolution they were designed for. 
Just like bitmap images, the more you enlarge a bitmap character, the worse 
it looks. This is particularly noticeable in rounded characters, such as O and P,
where “the jaggies” becomes an issue.
Outline fonts, on the other hand, are similar in concept and design to 
vector graphics. Each character is stored as a mathematical formula, and just 
like vector graphics, outline characters keep their clean shape no matter 
how much you enlarge them. The main outline font formats are Type 1, 
or PostScript, which was developed by Adobe, and TrueType, which was 
developed by Apple. As free TrueType fonts are so readily available on the 
Internet and so easily handled in Ubuntu, I will focus on TrueType fonts in 
this chapter. 

184
Chapter 11
Your Ubuntu system comes with a wide variety of very usable and, at 
least to my eyes, rather handsome TrueType fonts. However, these tend to 
be a bit on the conservative side of the aesthetic spectrum, and many users 
will want to add a few more distinctive fonts to the system repertoire. In my 
own case, I had this really cool idea of writing messages to my friend in old 
Scandinavian runes. (Of course, my friend wet-blanketed the idea, so it all 
came to naught. . . .) 
You probably won’t be interested in sending cryptic, runic messages to 
your friends, but you may want to print out an award for an event using some 
sort of Gothic font, or you might be preparing a newsletter for the local chap-
ter of your snail-breeders society and want to use a font that is round, bubbly, 
and slimy. Whatever your penchant, purpose, or desire, you will probably 
come to the point when you want to install some other TrueType fonts on 
your system. 
Before you install anything, of course, you have to find some fonts. The 
Internet is always good source, and there are many sites that have a variety 
of freeware, shareware, and for-sale TrueType fonts available for download. 
When choosing and downloading fonts, it is best to select those designed for 
Windows rather than those designed for Mac. Fonts designed for the Windows 
world will most likely be in the form of Zip files, which will pose no problem 
for you, because you can extract them with File Roller. Simply double-click 
them, just as you have with the other archived files you have used thus far, 
and click the Extract button in the File Roller window when it appears. The 
font file will appear on your desktop (or wherever your Zip file happened to 
be) as an icon showing an upper- and lowercase sample of the first letter in 
that font (Figure 11-1). 
Figure 11-1: Font icons display the first letter in the font.
In addition to getting a glimpse of what the fonts look like through 
these icons, you can also see all, or at least almost all, of the characters 
in a given font by double-clicking the font icon. A window, as shown in 
Figure 11-2, will open, showing you most of the characters in A-to-Z format 
and then in the traditional “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” 
format that you may well remember from your junior or senior high school 
typing classes.

Figure 11-2: Previewing a font by double-clicking 
the font icon
How you install fonts depends on who is going to use them. If you have only 
one user account on your machine, the easiest way is to install the fonts locally. 
Locally installed fonts are ones that only you or someone logged in to your 
user account will be able to use. On the other hand, if you have more than 
one user account and want the fonts to be available to all of the users on your 
machine, use the method described in Project 11B on page 187. 
11A-1: Getting the Font Files
The Internet is awash in free fonts. For this project, I will point you to the 
www.fontfreak.com site, which has a very nice collection of fonts. Once you 
get to the FontFreak splash page, click ENTER, which will lead you to the main 
page. Then click the button on the left that says PC Fonts, which will bring 
you to the first page of PC fonts. You can browse through the various pages 
until you find some fonts to your liking. Which fonts you download is 
completely up to you.
Since you will also need fonts for Project 11B, you might as well download 
them now too. All in all, for the two projects, you will need at least four fonts. 
When you’ve finished downloading, drag the font files to your home folder 
so it’s easy to follow along with my instructions. Also be sure to unzip your font 
files before going on to the installation steps. 
11A-2: Installing the Fonts
For this project, let’s use one of the fonts that you downloaded. After you’ve 
decided which font to use, follow these steps:
1.
Open a new Nautilus window by going to the Places menu in the GNOME 
Panel and selecting Home Folder. Once you’ve done that, open another 
Nautilus window by doing the same thing.
Project 11A: Installing TrueType Fonts Locally

186
Chapter 11
2.
In one of the Nautilus windows, go to the Go menu, and select Location.
A Location input box will then appear below the button bar in that 
window. You can also achieve the same result by pressing CTRL-L.
3.
In that Location box, type fonts:///, and press ENTER. Once you’ve done 
this, the window should be filled with the many icons representing the 
fonts you already have installed locally on your system. While you’re there, 
it wouldn’t be a bad idea to bookmark this window for future use.
4.
From the other open Nautilus window (your home folder window), select 
the unzipped font you want to install, and drag it to the fonts:/// folder 
window. 
You will notice that when you dragged your new font from your home 
folder window to the fonts:/// window, the icon for that new font file did 
not immediately appear. In fact, it will seem as if nothing at all happened 
and your installation attempt was a bust. Well, despite this lack of system 
acknowledgment, things were happening. The first time you install a font in 
this way, your system automatically creates a hidden .fonts folder in your home 
folder and places the font there. If you don’t like this lack of immediate 
feedback, you can check your .fonts folder by typing ~/.fonts in the Location 
box of one of the Nautilus windows. This will show you what fonts you have 
installed locally—at this point there should be only one.
Now that you have installed your font, you can go ahead and give it a try 
in one of your applications, such as OpenOffice.org Writer. (Any running 
applications need to be restarted before the new font will appear in that 
application’s font menu.)
11A-3: An Alternative Approach to Installing Fonts Locally
If you prefer truly immediate feedback on your installation progress, you can 
try the following variation of the installation process, which yields the same 
results as in Project 11A-2 on page 185. However, because this installation 
method uses the .fonts folder that is created in step 4 of Project 11A-2, you 
must either go through the process in Project 11A-2 with at least one font file 
prior to trying this installation method, or first create the folder yourself by 
opening a Terminal window (Applications Accessories Terminal), typing 
mkdir .fonts in that window, and pressing ENTER. Now that you’ve got your 
own .fonts folder, let’s use two more of the fonts you downloaded to try out 
the steps: 
1.
Assuming that you have already closed the two windows from 
Project 11A-2, open two new Nautilus windows.
2.
In one of the open Nautilus folders, type ~/.fonts, and press ENTER.
The main pane of that Nautilus window should show only one font 
or, if you bypassed Project 11A-2 and created the .fonts folder yourself, 
nothing at all. It would definitely be useful to bookmark this location 
while you’re there.

Font Feathered Frenzy
187
3.
In the other open Nautilus window, which is your home folder window, 
highlight both of the fonts you want to install by holding down the CTRL
key and then clicking the icon for each font. Then release the CTRL key, 
right-click either of the highlighted fonts, and select Copy Files in the 
popup menu.
4.
In the .fonts window, right-click on any open space in the window, and 
select Paste Files from the popup menu. The fonts will then appear in 
the Nautilus window.
Of course, you can just drag the fonts from your home folder to the .fonts 
folder instead of going through the procedure in steps 3 and 4. It’s strictly up 
to you. Either way, the procedure outlined in Project 11A-3 yields exactly the 
same results as that in Project 11A-2. The only difference is that you will 
immediately see that your fonts have been copied to the .fonts folder. 
Which method you choose in the future is, therefore, strictly a matter of 
personal preference.
11A-4: Uninstalling Locally Installed Fonts
Whether you used the installation method outlined in Project 11A-2 or 
Project 11A-3, you can uninstall any fonts installed locally by opening the 
.fonts folder in your home folder and then dragging the fonts you want to 
remove to the Trash.
As I mentioned already, the fonts you have installed thus far can only be used 
by you when you log in under your usual username. If, however, you want to 
install fonts that can be used by you and anyone else who has an account on 
your computer, the process is slightly different. We’ll use only one of the fonts 
you downloaded for this part of the project. 
11B-1: Installing Individual Fonts Globally
The font folder for globally installed fonts is in root territory, so you will 
need to put the sudo command to use in order to install fonts in this way. 
Here are the steps:
1.
Open a Terminal window, and then create a new folder for your 
fonts within the global location (let’s call it MyFonts) by typing 
sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/truetype/MyFonts and pressing ENTER.
2.
Type your password when prompted to do so, and press ENTER.
3.
Copy the font you want to install globally to your newly created global font 
folder by typing sudo cp fontname.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/MyFonts
and pressing ENTER. Be sure to include spaces on both sides of cp and 
after .ttf.
Project 11B: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally

188
Chapter 11
Be sure to include spaces on both sides of fontname.ttf. Also, be sure to 
use the name of your font in place of the word fontname. For example, if your 
font is called arachnid, you would type sudo cp arachnid.ttf /usr/share/fonts/
truetype/MyFonts.
You shouldn’t have to enter your password after step 3 since you already 
provided it in step 2, so the process is now complete. That being the case, go 
ahead and test things out by opening OpenOffice.org and looking for the 
font in the font menu. Remember that you will need to restart OpenOffice.org 
if it was already open when you installed the font.
11B-2: Installing Multiple Fonts Globally
If you want to install several fonts globally at the same time, you can do 
so quite easily. The process is essentially the same as in Project 11B-1 on 
page 187, with a slight variation. Here’s what you’ve got to do:
1.
Create a new subfolder in your home folder window. You can call it 
anything you like, but I’ll be using the name fonts2go in this project.
2.
Unzip the fonts and then place the ones you want to install via this 
method into the new fonts2go folder.
3.
Open a Terminal window, and then copy all of the fonts in your fonts2go 
folder to your new global font folder by typing sudo cp fonts2go/*.ttf 
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/MyFonts and pressing ENTER. Note the spaces 
surrounding cp and after *.ttf.
4.
Type your password if prompted to do so, and press ENTER.
NOTE
In step 3, you did not need to type the names of the fonts, as the wildcard character (*)
was essentially telling your system to copy all files ending in .ttf within the fonts2go 
folder. 
Now that you are done, check your results in OpenOffice.org. You should 
also back up the font files in the fonts2go folder to CD or floppy (just in case 
you need to install them on another system) and then trash the files. Keep 
the folder, however, so that you can use it again in the future. 
11B-3: Uninstalling Globally Installed Fonts
If you want to remove any fonts that you installed using either of the global 
installation methods introduced in this project, you can do so in the follow-
ing manner:
1.
Open a Terminal window, type sudo rm /usr/share/fonts/truetype/MyFonts/
fontname.ttf, and press ENTER. Be sure to replace fontname with the name 
of the font you are installing.
2.
Type your password, and press ENTER when prompted to do so.

Like it or not, the computing world is still pretty much a Microsoft world, and 
that means that the vast majority of users, even Mac users, are using Micro-
soft core fonts. That being the case, it is inevitable that you will have to deal 
with documents using fonts such as Georgia, Verdana, Times New Roman, 
and Courier, to name a few. Of course, your system can substitute the fonts it 
has for those used in the document, but in order for you to see things as they 
were intended and to allow others to see your documents the way you intended 
(web pages are good examples), it will probably behoove you to install those 
Microsoft core fonts on your own system. 
Fortunately for you, there are two ways to get these fonts. One is to 
download and install them via Synaptic, while the other, for those of you 
with a dual-boot setup, is to simply copy them from your Windows partition. 
In this project, I will explain how to perform the first of these procedures, 
so if you’re a Windows-less Ubuntu user (or a dual-booter who thinks the 
Synaptic approach is easier), here’s what you need to do: 
1.
Run the Synaptic Package Manager (System Administration Synaptic 
Package Manager), and provide your username when prompted.
2.
Click the Search button. In the Search window that appears, type 
msttcorefonts, and then click the Search button in that window.
3.
The msttcorefonts package should now appear in the list pane of the 
main Synaptic window, so click on the package name, select Mark for 
installation in the popup menu, and then follow the standard proce-
dures you learned in Chapter 5 for installing a package via Synaptic. 
When the process is complete, your new Microsoft fonts will have been 
successfully installed and ready for immediate use by every user account on 
your machine.
If you’re a dual-booter with Windows installed on another partition of your 
hard disk, you can take advantage of the fonts you already have on your Win-
dows partition. This is a bit more complicated than the process described in 
Project 11C, but you’ll end up with more fonts this way, and you will also have 
the choice of installing the fonts locally or globally. But first, you’ll have to 
mount your Windows partition. 
11D-1: Finding Your Windows Partition
Before you can actually mount your Windows partition, you need to find out 
where it is, and in what filesystem it is formatted, either File Allocation Table 
(FAT) or New Technology File System (NTFS). As is so common in Linux, 
Project 11C: Installing Microsoft Windows Core Fonts 
via Synaptic
Project 11D: Installing Microsoft Core Fonts from Your Windows 
Partition (for Dual-Booters)

Chapter 11
there are a couple of ways to do this. If you are a command lover, you can 
check things out by opening a Terminal window, typing sudo fdisk –l
(that’s the lowercase L there, not a numeral 1), and then pressing ENTER.
You will be prompted for your password, so type it, and press ENTER. A list 
of the partitions on your hard disk will appear (Figure 11-3).
Figure 11-3: Finding your Windows partition in the fdisk table
Take a look at this seemingly incomprehensible list, and then find the 
location and format of the Windows partition on your hard disk by scanning 
the column on the right for the first entry with the words FAT32 or NTFS. In 
most cases, this will be the first partition, /dev/hda1, but in the list for my hard 
disk, shown in Figure 11-3, the first partition is taken up by some diagnostic 
utility that the manufacturer’s Windows install disk had on it. If you’re using 
a computer from a brand-name manufacturer, you might find yourself in a 
similar situation.
Once you’ve found the first FAT32 or NTFS partition, jot down the file-
system type, and then do the same for its location at the far left of the list. 
In my case, that would be /dev/hda2 and FAT32.
11D-2: Mounting Your Windows Partition
Armed with the information you just gathered, you can now mount your 
Windows partition by doing the following:
1.
Create a mount point for your Windows partition by opening a Terminal 
window, typing sudo mkdir /media/windows, and pressing ENTER. You only 
need to perform this step the first time you try to mount your partition. 
After that, you need only perform steps 2 and 3.

Font Feathered Frenzy
191
2.
What you do in this step depends on whether your Windows partition 
is FAT32 or NTFS formatted. Choose the appropriate step, being 
sure to substitute /hda2 for /hda1 if that is what your Windows partition 
happens to be.
If your Windows partition is in FAT32 format, type
sudo /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t vfat –o iocharset=utf8,umask=000
If it is in NTFS format, type
sudo /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t ntfs –o nls=utf8,umask=0222
3.
Once you’ve typed the appropriate entry, press ENTER. If asked for your 
password, type it, and press ENTER. The Windows partition will then be 
mounted. You can double-check by opening a Nautilus window and click-
ing the Computer button. You should then find a hard disk icon with the 
word windows beneath it. You can even double-click that icon to access 
the files you have there, but you cannot save files to the partition if it 
is in NTFS format.
11D-3: Installing Fonts from Your Windows Partition
Now that your Windows partition is mounted, you can copy the fonts you have 
there and install them for use within Linux. To get started, go back to the 
Terminal window, type cd, press the spacebar, and then type the path to 
your Windows font folder. Most likely, the path to your font folder will be 
/mnt/windows/WINDOWS/Fonts, but it might be slightly different (/mnt/windows/
windows/Fonts, for example) depending on the version of Windows you are 
using. Once you’ve typed what you need to type, press ENTER.
Depending on whether you want to install your Windows fonts locally or 
globally, the next steps will be different.
Installing Windows Fonts Locally
To install your Windows fonts locally, just copy the font that you want to 
install to your .fonts folder by typing cp fontname.ttf ~/.fonts/ in the still 
open Terminal window and pressing ENTER. Be sure to replace fontname with 
the name of the font you want to install. 
If you want to go wild and copy all of the fonts in your Windows font 
directory (that’s a lot of fonts, mind you!), you can type *.ttf instead of 
fontname.ttf. Be sure that you have a space between cp and fontname.ttf and 
between fontname.ttf and ~/.fonts/. Once you’re done, you’re done.
Installing Windows Fonts Globally
To install your Windows fonts so that all users on your machine can use 
them, just return to the still open Terminal window. Then copy the font you 
want to the personal system font folder you created in step 1 of Project 11B-1 
on page 187 (and if you didn’t perform that step then, do so now) by typing 

192
Chapter 11
sudo cp fontname.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/MyFonts. If you want to 
copy and install all of the fonts in your Windows font directory, you can do 
so by typing sudo cp *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/MyFonts instead. After 
typing either of those strings, press ENTER, after which you will probably be 
prompted for your password, so type it, and press ENTER again. The job will 
then be done.
Unmounting Your Windows Partition
When you are done with your Windows partition, you can unmount it imme-
diately, or you can just wait until you shut down your system, whereupon 
it will be automatically unmounted. Before you can unmount it yourself, 
you must first be certain you aren’t accessing the directory, either from 
the Terminal window or from Nautilus. So, before issuing the unmount 
command, close any Nautilus windows open to that partition or, if you are 
using the Terminal, type cd to change back to your home directory. Type 
sudo umount /media/windows (that’s u-mount, not un-mount), and press ENTER.
Customizing Your System Fonts
Now that you know how to get and install fonts, you might be itching to use 
some of them to further customize your system. To get started doing this, just 
select Preferences Font in the System menu, which will bring up the Font 
Preferences window, shown in Figure 11-4.
Figure 11-4: Setting system font preferences 
As you can see, you can specify font preferences in five categories: 
applications, documents, desktop, window titles, and the Terminal (fixed 
width font). 

Font Feathered Frenzy
193
The choices you make take effect immediately, so you will soon know 
whether or not you can live with them. Unlike the other aspects of custom-
ization, those choices could drive you stark raving mad. Sure, it is easy and 
fun to live with the gaudiest desktop imaginable, the wildest and most mis-
matched color scheme on the planet, and the goofiest icons ever to be seen 
by post-Neanderthal man, but if your font selections get too out of hand, watch 
out! You do have to be able to read the results, after all. 
Making Things Look Better
The fonts you see on your screen generally look quite smooth and clean. 
If you are using an LCD monitor, however, you may find that fonts will look 
even better if you select Subpixel smoothing (LCDs) in the Font Preferences 
window. If you’re not sure whether you need to do this, just give it a try, and 
see if you notice any difference. GNOME applies changes immediately 
upon selection, so if you keep a window with text in it open behind the pref-
erences window, you can easily see the effect of each of your selections as 
you make them.
Creating Your Own Fonts with FontForge
After all this font talk, it seems only appropriate that I end this chapter by 
giving you the means to create your own fonts (or at least modify someone 
else’s). FontForge (previously known as PfaEdit) allows you to create or 
modify TrueType, PostScript, and bitmap fonts (see Figure 11-5). The 
interface itself seems a bit dated, but don’t let that fool you; FontForge is 
quite capable and easy to use.

Downloading, Installing, and Running FontForge
You can easily download and install FontForge via Synaptic. Just do a search 
for fontforge, mark the fontforge package for installation when it appears in 
the list of search results, and then follow the usual procedure for installing 
packages via Synaptic. You can run FontForge by going to the Applications
menu and selecting Programming FontForge. Font creation and modifica-
tion is too complex a topic for this book, but those of you already into this 
stuff probably just needed a pointer to the right tool and not my meager 
instructions.

Linux Speaks Your Language
These days, almost all operating systems 
are multilingual, or at least capable of 
becoming so. This is true of Linux as well. 
Just open your web browser, and, without per-
forming any special installations, you can read pages in 
any European language, including those with Cyrillic 
alphabets, such as Russian. You can even view pages in 
Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Arabic, and Hebrew, to name 
but a few. 
But the multilingual capabilities of Linux are much greater than this, 
and the way that GNOME-based distros, such as Ubuntu, handle multilingual 
matters makes it quite easy to take advantage of these capabilities. As you 
will soon see, you can even set up your system to give you a totally foreign 
language environment, allowing you to function completely in the language 
of your choice. Add to this the ever-expanding number of free programs 
available for language study, and you have a truly meaningful language-
learning tool.

Chapter 12
Read-Only Language Support
If all you want is to be able to read web pages or documents written in a 
foreign language, you don’t need to install any additional language support 
except in some rare cases. From the get-go, you will be able to view docu-
ments in just about any language you happen to throw at your system—
doesn’t matter if it’s Swedish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, 
Russian, Vietnamese, Armenian, or Thai. You will be able to read whatever 
you are linguistically capable of reading (see Figure 12-1 for an example). 
Figure 12-1: A Japanese web page displayed in Firefox
Changing the Character Encoding in Firefox
Firefox usually automatically recognizes the language in which a web page is 
written and thus displays the page correctly. Sometimes, however, the author 
of the page may neglect to include the character coding for that page in the 
HTML, in which case Firefox, not knowing that the page is prepared in 
another language, will open it in the default language of your system. The 
result is a page in which you see nothing but odd combinations of symbols 
and letters that have no meaning. In this case, try changing the character 
coding in Firefox to the language encoding you believe the page to be in. 
Some languages employ more than one encoding scheme, so if you’re not 
sure, give each one a try. You can make your choices by going to the Firefox 
View menu and selecting Character Encoding. From the submenu there, 
you can select the appropriate coding for the language of that page. 
Typing Nonstandard Characters
Typing characters that are not standard in English, such as é, ç, ß, ø, æ, and å, 
can be done quite easily in Linux without any modifications. In most situa-
tions, you can do this by using the Character Map utility included in your 

Polyglot Penguins
197
system, which can be found at Applications Accessories Character Map.
Upon running Character Map, a window like the one shown in Figure 12-2 
will appear.
Figure 12-2: Inputting characters with the Character 
Map utility
To input the character you want, just select the language or character 
set in the left pane of the window, and then, in the right pane, click on the 
character you want to input. The character will appear in the little input box 
next to the words Text to copy at the bottom of the window. Just click the Copy
button, and then paste the character wherever you want to place it. 
In certain applications, such as the various OpenOffice.org modules, 
this method will not work. In these cases, the program usually offers a method 
of its own. In OpenOffice.org, for example, you can click Insert in the menu 
bar and then select Special Character. A selection window will open, and 
you can select the character you want there. Once you’ve done that, click 
the OK button, and the character will appear in your document, after 
which the selection window will close by itself.
Using the Compose Key Option
If you only need to type an accent or umlaut once in a while, and don’t feel 
particularly keen on opening an application or going to a special menu to do 
so, using the compose key option for your keyboard is a good way to go. Basically 
what this means is that you use one of the lesser-used keys on your keyboard 
in conjunction with six symbols (` , ' ~ " ^) to help in the creation, so to speak, 
of accented characters. By default, the compose key is the right ALT key.
Let’s say, for example, that you wanted to type an umlauted u (ü). While 
pressing the right ALT key, you would press ". Then you would release the 
right ALT key, press u, and . . . voilà, you’d have yourself an ü. Here are some 
more examples:
á
right ALT + ' then a
ñ
right ALT + ~ then n
ç
right ALT + , then c
ô
right ALT + ^ then o
è
right ALT + ` then e

Chapter 12
Using the Keyboard Indicator
If you often type in a particular foreign language, it might be more conven-
ient for you to use the Keyboard Indicator GNOME Panel utility. This utility 
lets you switch quickly among various keyboard layouts. For example, if you 
often type in Swedish, and thus use the characters å, ä, and ö regularly, using 
the appropriate keyboard layout would be easier than repeatedly using the 
Character Map. Of course, you will have to familiarize yourself with the key-
board layout, or keymap, for each language you choose, but this is a relatively 
easy task.
The Keyboard Indicator is already included in your system, so there is no 
need to install it. To access it, simply right-click somewhere on the GNOME 
Panel where you would like to place a launcher for it. Then, from the popup 
menu select Add to Panel. When the Add to Panel window appears, scroll 
down and click Keyboard Indicator, and then click the Add button. The 
letters USA or GBr will then appear on the panel. 
Now, this alone will give you nothing except your default keymap, so 
you must configure Keyboard Indicator if you want to be able to use other 
keymaps. To do so, just right-click the icon, and from the popup menu select 
Open Keyboard Preferences, which will open the Keyboard Preferences 
window. 
To add a keymap, click the Layouts tab in that window, and then once in 
the new tab, click Add. After you do this, the Choose a Layout window will 
appear with a list of the keymaps available to you (Figure 12-3). In the left 
pane of that window, scroll down to the keymap for the country of the lan-
guage you want to add, and then click it to select the standard keyboard 
layout for that locale (click the arrow next to the country for a list of optional 
layouts if you prefer). Once you’ve made your selection, click the OK button, 
which will bring you back to the Keyboard Preferences window, where you 
will find your new keymap listed along with the original. You can then click 
the Close button to complete the setup.
Figure 12-3: Adding keyboard layouts to the Keyboard 
Indicator
After closing the Keyboard Preferences window, the keyboard layouts can 
be changed by clicking the icon in the panel. You can also change between 
keyboard layouts by going to the Layout Options tab of the Keyboard Pref-
erences window and assigning a keyboard shortcut. If you are not sure where 

Polyglot Penguins
199
the keys you want to type are located in your new keymap, switch to the key-
map in question by clicking the panel Keyboard Indicator until it appears and 
then right-clicking it. In the popup menu that appears, select Layout View,
after which a map of the new layout will appear in a separate window. The 
default window size is quite small, but it can be resized in the usual drag-
the-corner manner.
If you just want to choose a single keyboard layout to replace your 
present one (such as British English instead of American English or German 
instead of Spanish), you can do so from the Keyboard Preferences window 
by adding the keyboard layout you want to use, checking the box next to 
the word Default, and then removing the original layout by clicking it once 
to select it and clicking the Remove button. 
Viewing Your System in Another Language
One of the many things that originally attracted me to the Linux world was 
being able to install language support for languages other than English. On 
one of my machines, I have installed support for Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, 
and my default, English. With just a simple logout and a few more clicks, I 
can log back in with an interface in a totally different language. I can have a 
Chinese, Japanese, or Swedish system whenever I want. 
This is very useful if you are going to be doing a lot of work in a foreign 
language, or if you are studying a foreign language and want to give yourself 
as much exposure as possible to it. It is also very handy when you have users 
with different native languages using the same machine. At my former uni-
versity, for example, where my Japanese and Chinese students sometimes 
used my computer, the additional language support allowed them to log in 
using their own language. All in all, it is a very useful feature. 
Taking advantage of this feature in the GNOME environment is very 
easy and, depending on the language you wish to use, requires little in 
terms of special installation measures. Basically all you have to do is install 
a group of support files for each language you want to add to your system. 
You can do this quite easily by going to the System menu and selecting 
Administration Language Selector. This will bring up the Language Support 
window (Figure 12-4), where you can check the boxes next to the languages 
for which you want to install support. Once you have made your selections, 
click the Apply button, and the Language Selector will begin downloading 
and then installing the support packages you specified. 
Multilingual Login
Once you have installed support for any additional languages you want, you 
can log out of your current session and log in to a new one in a different 
language environment. The actual switch is made from your login screen.
Just below the text box where you would normally type your username, 
click the link that says Language, after which a window with a list of the 
languages you have installed will appear. Select the language you want to 
use in the next session by clicking once on its name and then clicking the 
OK button. The language list window will then close automatically, and you 

200
Chapter 12
can proceed as usual by typing your login name and password (pressing the 
ENTER key after each, of course). A little window will then pop up asking you 
if you want to use the language you’ve chosen as your default language forever 
and ever. You can either click Just for This Session or Make Default depending 
on your personal preferences. Whatever you do end up choosing, fear not; 
it’s no big deal to change back at a later point in time by logging out of 
your system, logging back in to your system under your previous default 
language, and clicking Make Default.
Figure 12-4: Installing additional 
language support
Your startup process will then continue, and everything will progress 
as it usually does. Depending on what language you’ve chosen, once your 
desktop appears you will be in another linguistic world. Your menus, appli-
cations, and even the little Tips windows that pop up when you run your 
mouse over a panel icon will all be in the newly selected language. (Figure 12-5 
shows the System menu in a variety of languages.) 
Figure 12-5: The Applications menu shown in English, Korean, Russian, 
Thai, and Vietnamese
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Input
For most European languages (and many other alphabet-based non-
European languages), pressing a letter on the keyboard simply prints that 
letter to the screen. However, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean require a 

Polyglot Penguins
201
kind of conversion process that is handled by a special application (actually 
a set of applications) called an Input Method Editor (IME). Of course, this is 
a Windows-world term, but I will use it here for convenience’s sake. In any 
case, each of these languages has its own IME, and each is quite different 
due to the basic differences in the three writing systems. 
Chinese
While most people (at least those in the linguistic know) would think that 
Chinese would be the most complicated system, because the writing system 
consists of thousands of characters, it is in fact the simplest. The Chinese 
IME simply takes the romanized keyboard input, known as pinyin, and 
converts it into Chinese characters, or Hanzi. For the IME, it is essentially a 
simple dictionary lookup task—big dictionary, simple IME. In the event 
that there is more than one character for the pinyin input, a list of possible 
candidates will appear, and the user can then simply select the appropriate 
character from that list.
Japanese
The Japanese IME has a considerably more complicated task to perform, as it 
has three writing systems to deal with: Kanji (ideographic characters borrowed 
long ago from China), hiragana (the phono-alphabetic system used mainly 
for tense and case endings), and katakana (used mainly for words borrowed 
from other languages). Still, the standard input method for Japanese is 
primarily via the standard Roman keyboard layout, plus a few extra special-
function keys. Thus, typing in Japanese is a two-step process whereby the 
IME first converts the romanized text into hiragana as it is typed and then 
converts it to appropriate Kanji, katakana, or hiragana elements after the 
spacebar is pressed. 
You can see an example of these steps in Figure 12-6. In the first line, 
the IME has already converted the romanized input on the fly. It has con-
verted rinakkusdenihongonyuuryokumodekimasu (which means You can also input 
Japanese in Linux) to hiragana. The fact that line is underlined means that it 
has not yet been converted beyond that. In the second line, however, the 
user has subsequently pressed the spacebar, which caused the IME to convert 
the hiragana string into the appropriate Kanji, hiragana, and katakana ele-
ments. The first word, Linux, has been converted to katakana text, as it is a 
borrowed word, while Japanese input has been converted to Kanji; the rest 
stays in hiragana. 
Figure 12-6: IME conversions while typing in Japanese

202
Chapter 12
Korean
The job of the Korean IME is again quite different from that of the Chinese 
and Japanese IMEs, as the language itself is written in a very different way. 
Korean is written either entirely in alphabetic letters, called Hangul, or in a 
combination of Hangul and ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese 
called Hanja. While the Hanja characters are essentially the same as their 
Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Hanzi and Kanji, the Korean phonetic 
alphabet, Hangul, has it own unique appearance, as you can see in the 
Korean word for Korea, Hangug(k), in Figure 12-7. 
Figure 12-7: Korea (Hangug) written 
horizontally in Hangul 
This seems simple; however, the representation is not quite correct, as 
Korean is very unique in the way that its alphabetic characters are put to 
the page. Unlike the usual side-by-side positioning of hiragana, katakana, 
and most other languages written with an alphabet, Hangul letters are 
grouped in pairs, triplets, or even quadruplets, which are written, as a 
general rule, clockwise. The IME, therefore, must take the input (usually 
based on a Korean alphabetical keyboard layout) while it is being typed, 
and it must adjust the size, spacing, and positioning of each of the letters 
as it puts them into appropriate clusters (see Figure 12-8). 
Figure 12-8: An example of the clustering 
process in the Korean IME
So what do you do if, for example, you want to be able to type Chinese, 
Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Thai, or Nepali while still in your usual English 
environment? What if you want to be able to type all of those languages in 
the same document? Can you do it? 
You bet.
There are actually several ways of going about this, but the one of the 
most straightforward to use is Smart Common Input Method (SCIM), the 
base for which comes preinstalled in Ubuntu. SCIM supports most Asian 
languages, including Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and it provides a 
number of input methods for many of these.

12-1: Enabling SCIM to Work with OpenOffice.org and Firefox
Despite coming preinstalled on Ubuntu, SCIM does not yet work with 
OpenOffice.org, Firefox, or Thunderbird right out of the box—or to be a 
bit more accurate, they do not work with SCIM. Since these three applica-
tions are probably the ones an average user is most likely to use with the 
greatest frequency, it is a serious limitation indeed. Fortunately, there is a 
rather simple two-step remedy for this state of affairs. 
First of all, run Synaptic, do a search for im-switch, and then install 
it. Once the installation is complete, open a Terminal window, type 
im-switch –z en_US –s scim, and press ENTER. If you get a warning message 
about a dependency check not working, just ignore it.
Job done.
After you log out and log back in, SCIM will be there waiting for you in 
whatever application you happen to need it.

You may have noticed in the previous section that I said that SCIM’s “base” 
is already installed for you; this does not mean, however, that CJK (Chinese/
Japanese/Korean) support is installed. As is, SCIM only allows you to type in 
Russian and Vietnamese. For Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and any other 
language support, you have to install the specific modules for those lan-
guages yourself via Synaptic. Depending on the language you want to use, 
you need to do a Synaptic search for scim, and then install one or any 
combination of the following:
 For simplified Chinese (pinyin) input support, install scim-pinyin.
 For traditional Chinese (zhuyin/bopomofo) input support, install 
scim-chewing.
 For Japanese input support, install scim-anthy.
 For Korean input support, install scim-hangul.
There are also sets of additional input methods available for each of 
these languages. If, for example, you type in Korean based on the standard 
English keyboard layout or if you need Hangul-to-Hanja conversion capabil-
ities, you should also install scim-tables-ko. Additional Japanese methods are 
available in the scim-tables-ja package, while those for Chinese are available 
in scim-tables-zh.
You can also use SCIM as a convenient way to type in other Asian 
languages that do not require special conversion routines, such as Thai, 
Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, and Panjabi. To use SCIM for input support for 
these languages, install scim-tables-additional.
12-3: Typing in Asian Languages with SCIM
Once you have installed the input modules for the languages you want, 
using SCIM is quite simple. To get a feel for how it works, open Gedit 
(Applications Accessories Text Editor).

204
Chapter 12
Once Gedit appears, click the SCIM panel applet. A list of the available 
languages that can be handled via SCIM will then appear in a drop-down 
menu (Figure 12-9). Remember, however, that the number of languages 
appearing in that menu will be dependent on the number of language 
packages you installed. 
Figure 12-9: A list of the languages that 
can be handled by SCIM
From that list, select the language you want to use, and then, for those 
languages where you are given a choice, select the input method you prefer. 
The icon for the SCIM panel applet will reflect the change by showing the 
icon for the language you have chosen. You can then start typing. 
At this point, a small input palette like the one in Figure 12-10 will 
appear at the bottom-right corner of the screen. This palette, in addition to 
displaying the language and input method currently in use, also allows you 
to easily switch between English and the current language of input, or to 
switch from the language in which you are currently typing to another. By 
clicking the red button at the far-right end of the palette, you can also find 
out what the hotkeys are for the input method you are currently using. 
Figure 12-10: The SCIM input palette
Regardless of the input method you are dealing with, probably the most 
important hotkey combination you will want to use is SHIFT-spacebar, which 
toggles you back and forth between English and the language you currently 
have selected in SCIM.

Getting Down to Business in Linux
I have to admit it: When I think about the 
joys of computing, I tend to think of the 
more hedonistic, self-indulgent areas like 
gaming, music, and graphics. Still, as is the case 
for most computer users, what I usually end up doing 
on my computer is work, and writing this book falls 
into that category.
Fortunately, Linux can get down to business and do it as well as the next 
OS. I think it’s safe to say that you are missing nothing and are probably 
gaining quite a bit in terms of home and office productivity programs in the 
world of Linux. In this chapter, I’ll walk you through the Linux offerings in 
this department.

206
Chapter 13
OpenOffice.org
Whether they should be or not, people are quite obsessed with office suites, 
even though most people seldom need more than a word processor. The 
de facto standard among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available 
in both the Windows and Macintosh worlds. Of course, as it is a Microsoft 
product, you can be quite sure that there is no Linux version available. 
Fortunately, Linux does have an exceedingly capable office suite in the 
form of OpenOffice.org, which is, incidentally, also freely available (as in free)
in Windows and Mac OS X versions. OpenOffice.org is not some lightweight 
sour-grapes substitute for the Microsoft Office–less Linux world; it is a full-
featured contender, and in some cases, OpenOffice.org is a clear winner.
OpenOffice.org Applications
The entire OpenOffice.org office suite consists of six applications: a word 
processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation creator and player 
(Impress), a vector drawing program (Draw), a database (Base), and a 
mathematical formula editor (Math). Most of these can be accessed at 
Applications Office.
Since giving full and detailed instructions on how to use each of these 
applications would take up an entire book (and there are entire books on 
the subject), I will simply introduce each module to you. Being a bit of a 
mathematics dunce, however, I won’t be venturing too deeply into what 
you can do with Math. That said, here goes.
Writer
As I mentioned earlier, the word processor is the office application that the 
majority of users turn to most often. Fortunately, OpenOffice.org Writer is a 
good one (see Figure 13-1). It is chock-full of features and can read and save 
Microsoft Word files. Like Word, it will even let you save your documents as 
HTML files so that you can easily change your documents into web pages.
Figure 13-1: OpenOffice.org Writer

Penguins Back at Work
207
As I said, Writer is a very straightforward word processor, so I won’t go on 
about it, but if you would like an introduction to using Writer, check out the 
First Steps tutorial at the OpenOffice.org website (www.openoffice.org/
writerfirststeps/writerfirststeps.html).
Calc
Calc is the OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application, and it is similar to Excel 
in terms of capabilities and general layout (see Figure 13-2). It can also, quite 
importantly, read and save Microsoft Excel files.
Figure 13-2: A graph created in OpenOffice.org Calc
Since most people who use spreadsheets generally understand what they 
are all about and, after a bit of poking around, can figure out how to use them, 
I won’t go into any sort of primer about using Calc. However, as there are 
many others who don’t see any need to even try using spreadsheets, I will 
mention a few of the simpler things that can be done with Calc, in the hope 
of enticing some of you into trying it.
Most people who don’t use spreadsheets think of them as a sort of giant 
calculators used for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, like 
payrolls (which was the original purpose of such applications). That’s right, 
of course, but spreadsheets can be used for everyday tasks too, such as pro-
jecting household budgets, calculating grade point averages (by teachers or 
students), figuring out how long it will take you to save up for your trip to 
Hungary, or even for something as weird as comparing the seat heights for 
the four or five motorcycles you are trying to choose among. And when 
doing any of these minor mathematical tasks, you can easily create graphs 
in order to make all the abstract numbers speak to you visually.

208
Chapter 13
If numbers are just not your thing, you can still use Calc for creating lists 
of information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, address 
lists . . . whatever. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical order, 
or sort them by date of birth, and so on. Everyone eventually seems to find 
some use for Calc, so don’t ignore it entirely.
Impress
Impress is OpenOffice.org’s answer to Microsoft’s PowerPoint, with which it 
is compatible. It allows you to create graphically attractive slides for use in 
presentations and also allows you to create notes or handouts to accompany 
them. While these features make Impress quite handy in business and 
education settings, you may not find as much value in it as a home user. 
Draw
More useful to the home user is OpenOffice.org Draw. Although Draw isn’t 
all that great a program for creating true graphics in the artistic sense, it is 
very useful for creating flowcharts, organizational diagrams (like seating 
arrangements for wedding receptions or conferences), or any other docu-
ment in which you want a bit more control over the placement of text and 
graphics (especially when the two are combined), such as for fliers, awards, 
diagrams, and newsletters. In this sense, Draw can be used quite effectively 
as a simple page layout program, as you can see in Figure 13-3.
Figure 13-3: A newsletter created (and displayed) in OpenOffice.org Draw
Although Draw comes bundled with Ubuntu, it is no longer listed in the 
Applications menu, probably because its functions can be accessed through 

Penguins Back at Work
209
the other OpenOffice.org modules. Still, it is a handy application to use on 
its own, so if you would like to use it in its stand-alone form, you can run it 
either via the Run Application panel applet by typing ooffice -draw or by 
adding the launcher yourself to the Applications menu.
To add Draw to the Applications menu, open the Alacarte Menu Editor 
(Applications Accessories Alacarte Menu Editor). Once the editor window 
appears, click Graphics or Office (or both) in the left pane, depending on 
where you want the menu launcher to appear. In the right pane of the window, 
check the box next to the words OpenOffice.org Drawing. Once you’re done, 
click the Close button, and the Draw launcher will then appear in the menu.
Base
New to OpenOffice.org is Base, which is a graphical front end to any data-
bases you have on your machine, including Base’s own database, called 
HSQL. Unfortunately, learning how to use Base is no cakewalk if you don’t 
have any experience working with database applications, so if the database 
module in AppleWorks is the extent of your contact with such applications, 
you might want to try out a relatively easy-to-follow tutorial (with a not-so-
easy-to-follow URL) at http://searchopensource.techtarget.com/tip/
1,289483,sid39_gci1148271,00.html.
Math
Finally, we come to OpenOffice.org Math. As I am a bit out of it in terms of 
math, I can’t really tell you much more about Math other than that it is a 
mathematics formula editor that allows you to produce complex mathe-
matical formulae and then paste them as embedded objects into other 
OpenOffice.org programs. It is strictly an editor and does not calculate. I 
think I am safe in saying that most common folk have no need for it in their 
everyday lives, unless, of course, you write math textbooks for a living.
Like Draw, OpenOffice.org Math is not listed in the Applications 
menu, but you can access it via the Run Application panel applet by typing 
ooffice -math. Oh, and if you do happen to write math textbooks for a living, 
you can also add a launcher for Math to your Applications menu, just as you 
did for Draw, by means of the Alacarte Menu Editor. In the open editor 
window, just click Office, and then check the box next to the words 
OpenOffice.org Formula.
Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org File Compatibility
Although I mention the point throughout this section, it is worthwhile to 
re-emphasize that OpenOffice.org can read and write Microsoft Office files. 
This compatibility is quite good, though tables sometimes prove slightly 
problematic. 
In order to read Microsoft Office files, all you need to do is double-
click the file in question, and it will open in the appropriate OpenOffice.org 
module. When saving files within OpenOffice.org to use within Microsoft 
Office, however, you must save them into the appropriate format, as 

210
Chapter 13
OpenOffice.org will otherwise save files into its native format (.odt for Writer 
documents, .ods for Calc documents, and .odp for Impress documents) 
by default.
To do this when saving a file, click the small arrow next to the words File 
type in the Save window, and select the appropriate Microsoft Office format 
from the list of available file formats listed in the pane that then appears—
Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP for a Writer document, for example.
OpenOffice.org Features
The three main applications in OpenOffice.org (Writer, Calc, and Impress) 
are, respectively, quite similar to their equivalents in Microsoft Office (Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint), so switching over to the OpenOffice.org applica-
tions should be relatively easy. 
If you don’t have any experience with Microsoft Office, you should still 
find it all pretty straightforward, as the basic layout is pretty intuitive. And if 
you are lacking in the intuition department, the built-in Help files are pretty 
good, too. To further help you along, the Tips system works just like tooltips 
in the Windows and Mac worlds. In case you aren’t sure what I’m talking 
about, tooltips are those little yellow boxes that pop up to tell you what a 
button or menu item does when you place your mouse over that button or 
menu item. 
Despite all the straightforwardness I am speaking of, there are a few 
interface items that will most likely be unfamiliar to you. That being the case, 
I will briefly discuss those items. I’ll be using the word processor, Writer, as I 
describe these things, so if you want to run OpenOffice.org while following 
along, Writer might be a convenient starting point for you too. 
Getting to Know the Buttons
Although you should pretty much be able to figure out what all of the buttons 
on the OpenOffice.org toolbars do, there are a few buttons common to all 
OpenOffice.org modules that most likely require, or at least deserve, a bit 
more explanation. I will cover the function of these buttons as shown in 
Figure 13-4 from left to right. 
Figure 13-4: Some possibly unfamiliar buttons 
in OpenOffice.org
Export to PDF
This first button (Figure 13-4) is situated to the left of the two printer buttons 
(Print and Print Preview). You can use this button to export, or save, your 
document as a PDF file, in a manner that is similar to (albeit easier than) 
the one in Chapter 10.

Penguins Back at Work
211
Hyperlink
Clicking the Hyperlink button, the second button in Figure 13-4, brings up 
the Hyperlink window, from which you can assign links to specified docu-
ments—not only to web pages, but also to documents on an individual 
computer, and even targets within that document. While a hyperlink on a 
web page is something we have all come to take for granted, the idea of 
hyperlinking between text documents sounds like a pretty radical concept. 
It is, in fact, a rather old one that has been around since before you or I 
even heard of the Internet. 
Navigator
The third button in Figure 13-4 (the one that looks like a starburst) is the 
Navigator button. Clicking this button brings up the Navigator window (see 
Figure 13-5), which is a pretty cool navigational feature that comes in handy 
when working with lengthy or otherwise complex documents. 
Figure 13-5: The Navigator window
The Navigator allows you to easily bounce back and forth between 
pages in a document or even between elements therein, such as sections, 
links, and so on. Let’s say that you have a document with lots of illustra-
tions in it (like this chapter), and you want to jump directly from graphic 
to graphic. In this case, you would double-click the word Graphics in the 
main pane of the Navigator window and then click the jump buttons 
(the odd little buttons to the left of the page number selector) to begin 
jumping.
If you are dealing with a document containing various heading levels, 
like all of the chapters in this book, you can also use Navigator to switch 
among those levels. Say you’ve decided to add a new main heading at the 
last minute to a document you’ve been writing. All of the headings you had 
before thus need to be dropped down a notch; the former main heading 
becoming a subheading, and so on. By double-clicking the word Headings, 
the text of all the headings you have listed in the document would then 
appear. You could then select a heading in that list, and then click the 
Demote Level button (that’s the one at the far right of the second row of 
buttons) to move it down a notch.

212
Chapter 13
Gallery
The fourth button in Figure 13-4 is the Gallery button. By clicking this button, 
the Gallery, a library of graphical elements for use in your documents or web 
pages, will appear in a separate pane at the top of your document window 
(see Figure 13-6). The elements within the Gallery range from various types 
of lines to buttons to colored three-dimensional doughnuts, and you can 
even add items of your own.
Figure 13-6: The Gallery
Inserting a graphic into your document is a simple enough task even 
when not using the Gallery. All you need to do is go to the Insert menu, 
select Picture From File, and then locate the image file you want to insert. 
It can be handier to use the Gallery, however, when you intend to use certain 
graphics frequently. Once in the Gallery, your graphics are always only a click 
or two away and can be conveniently viewed in the Gallery browser window. 
Adding your own graphics to the Gallery is also relatively easy to do. First 
you have to create a new category (called a theme) for each group of images you 
wish to add. To create a Gallery theme of your own, just click the New Theme
button in the Gallery window. This will open the New Theme Properties 
window, where you should first click the General tab and give your theme a 
name. Once you’ve done that, click the Files tab, and then the Find Files
button, which will bring up a Select Path window. From there you can navigate 
to the folder in which you are storing your clip art, photos, or other graphics. 
Once you have found the folder, click the Select button, after which a list of 
all the files in that folder will appear in New Theme Properties window. 
You can easily add images to your new Gallery theme by clicking on the 
name of each image you wish to add (you might want to make sure that the 
box next to the word Preview is checked to make things a bit easier), and then 
clicking the Add button. Once you have done that, a copy of the image will 
immediately appear in the Gallery browser, where it will remain for future 

Penguins Back at Work
213
use. To use one of the images in the Gallery, just right-click the image you 
wish to insert into your document, and then select Copy or Link in the 
popup menu.
Data Source
The fifth button shown in Figure 13-4 is the Data Source button. Clicking 
this button opens a Data Source browser within a new pane in the top half of 
your document window. From that pane you can then access and edit records 
stored within any databases you have registered in OpenOffice.org. From a 
database containing personal contact information (such as Evolution’s 
Addressbook), for example, you could simply do a search for an individual 
entry, and then drag the name, address, phone number, and/or email address 
for that entry into your document, rather than searching for the data else-
where and then typing it in all over again. 
Styles and Formatting
The last button shown in Figure 13-4 is the Styles and Formatting button. 
This button acts as a toggle for the Styles and Formatting window (Fig-
ure 13-7), from which you can select and then apply styles to any of the 
various elements within your document. 
Figure 13-7: The Styles and 
Formatting window
To give you an example of how convenient using styles can be, imagine 
that you are typing a bibliography page for some document you’ve prepared. 
You typed each entry as you might any paragraph, as in:
Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech 
between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. The 
Journal of the Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes, 
20 (2), 125-147.
Like most paragraphs you type, the entry is formatted as a first-line 
indent, which is fine and dandy except for the fact that you want a hang-
ing indent, which is the norm for bibliography entries. Rather than messing 

214
Chapter 13
around with tabs or margins to get things the way you want, all you have to do 
is click your mouse anywhere within the paragraph, and then double-click 
the Hanging Indent entry in the Styles and Formatting window. After that, 
as if by magic (though you know better), the transformation is made:
Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech 
between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of 
seven. The Journal of the Society of Elves, Faeries, 
and Garden Gnomes, 20 (2), 125-147.
You could follow the same procedure for each of your other entries, or, 
with Hanging Indent selected, click the paint can button in the Styles and 
Formatting window, after which your mouse cursor, when placed over the 
document, will appear as a paint can. Place that paint-can cursor in any other 
paragraph in your bibliography, and that entry, too, will be formatted in the 
new style. The process is essentially the same when applying different styles 
to any other document elements.
Word Processing Done Lightly with AbiWord
If OpenOffice.org’s Writer is a bit more powerful than what you need for 
your everyday word processing chores, and you would prefer something that 
pops up as soon as you click the launcher, then you might want to consider 
giving another word processor, AbiWord, a try (Figure 13-8). 
Figure 13-8: The other Linux word processor—AbiWord
AbiWord has a very straightforward and easy-to-use interface, which you 
should be able to figure out without much, if any, help. It also has a couple of 
rather interesting features, such as its auto-resize function, which magnifies 
the onscreen document size (fonts, images, and everything) or shrinks it as 
you increase or decrease the size of the program window. And in case you’re 
wondering, AbiWord can save and read Microsoft Word DOC files and save 
documents as PDF files.

Penguins Back at Work
215
You can easily install AbiWord via Synaptic by performing a search for 
abiword, and then . . . well, you know the drill by now. Once you have AbiWord 
installed, you can run it by going to the Applications menu and selecting 
Office AbiWord Word Processor.
Some Other Cool Productivity Apps
In addition to the more traditional office applications, there are a number of 
other applications either included with or available for your system that can 
be grouped together under the “productivity” label. I will introduce a few of 
those to you here.
Sticky Notes
Mac users will be well familiar with the digital version of the now ubiquitous 
little yellow Post-It–like notes called Sticky Notes (Figure 13-9) that come as 
part of the GNOME desktop. GNOME’s Sticky Notes is a panel applet that 
you can add to your own panel by right-clicking on any open panel space and 
then selecting Add to Panel in the popup menu that then appears. When 
the Add to Panel window appears, go to the Accessories section, click Sticky 
Notes, and then click the Add button. You will then be ready for note-taking 
action.
Figure 13-9: GNOME’s Sticky Notes
I should mention that there is one slightly annoying “feature” of Sticky 
Notes that makes it a bit different from what you might be used to. When you 
click on the desktop, all of your notes will disappear. This is as it is supposed 
to be, though I personally can’t see the point (and wouldn’t like it much even 
if I could). Fortunately, however, you can bring all of your notes back to view 
by simply clicking the Sticky Notes panel applet. In fact, if you decide to remove 
the panel applet and then bring it back at some later point in time, you’ll be 
happy to know that all of the notes you created before will be back too.
Tomboy
If Sticky Notes just doesn’t cut it for you and your more dramatic note-taking 
needs, then perhaps you will find yourself better served by an application 
called Tomboy (Figure 13-10). Like Sticky Notes, Tomboy also works as a 

216
Chapter 13
panel applet, but it is a bit more full featured, albeit without making any 
claims to stickiness. Instead, the various notes you create can be viewed by 
selecting them from the menu that appears when you click the Tomboy 
panel applet itself. All in all, a very handy approach. 
Figure 13-10: Notes taken seriously—Tomboy
What really gives Tomboy its bragging rights, however, is its search and 
hyperlink functions. These allow you to search for entries within your entire 
Tomboy note library, and create hyperlinks that connect text in one note to 
another linked note. In fact, Tomboy will automatically create a hyperlink 
whenever you type a word that matches one of your existing note headings. 
To make matters even more exciting (or at least more useful), Tomboy, by 
means of its plugins feature, allows you to export notes to HTML or print 
them out, either as hard copy or as PDF docs. 
You can install Tomboy via Synaptic by doing a search for tomboy. Once 
installed, start it up by going to Applications Accessories Tomboy, after 
which Tomboy will appear in the top GNOME Panel.
GnuCash
If you are familiar with the personal financial management software Quicken, 
then you might be interested in GnuCash (shown in Figure 13-11), which is 
the Linux world’s best-known offering in the personal finance arena. It reads 
Quicken and Intuit QIF files, which makes things even nicer should you be 
making the transition from another operating system. Unfortunately, unless 
you live in Germany, you cannot use GnuCash for online banking; but as the 
GnuCash folks themselves say, don’t blame them, blame your bank.
To install GnuCash, just do a Synaptic search for gnucash, and then 
mark both gnucash and gnucash-docs for installation. Once these are 
installed, you can run the application via the Run Application panel applet 
by typing gnucash and then clicking Run.

Figure 13-11: GnuCash
Scribus
To round things out, we come to the open source desktop publishing applica-
tion, Scribus (shown in Figure 13-12), for those times when OpenOffice.org 
Writer and Draw just don’t cut it. Scribus is designed to produce commercial-
grade output, with support for professional publishing features, such as 
CMYK colors, PostScript handling, and creation of color separations, to 
name but a few. 
Figure 13-12: Scribus
You can download and install Scribus by doing a Synaptic search for 
scribus. Once the installation is complete, you can run the application from 
Applications Office Scribus.

Linux Does Art
Now that you know that you can get down 
to business in Linux, it is time to don that 
beret of yours and address the artistic side of 
things. Yes, Linux does art, and as you will soon 
find out, there are a good number of programs on your 
system that allow you to create and manipulate graphic 
files. These days, however, there is perhaps nothing as 
important to most users’ graphical repertoires as their 
digital cameras, so that is where we’ll begin.
While scanner support for Linux is still a bit spotty, support for digital 
cameras is significantly better. Linux supports over 700 cameras through the 
bundled gPhoto2 digital camera software package, which is essentially a 
collection of drivers that works in the background to tell your computer how 
Project 14A: Digital Cameras

220
Chapter 14
to communicate with your camera. To see if your camera is supported, go to 
the gPhoto2 website (www.gphoto.org), scroll down, and click 700 cameras.
On that page you will find a complete list of all the cameras supported by 
gPhoto2. If your camera isn’t on the list, it most likely means (as the page 
points out) that your camera is so old that there is little demand for support 
for it or that it is so new that there hasn’t been enough time to develop sup-
port for it. Of course, gPhoto2 is constantly being updated, so if your camera 
isn’t on the list now, it could be in the near future. Updating gPhoto2 with 
Synaptic now and again should keep you as up to date as possible.
If your camera is not supported by gPhoto2, all is not lost. First of all, there 
are some cameras that utilize what is called the USB Mass Storage protocol. 
These cameras function, without the help of gPhoto2, as USB storage devices, 
just like a thumb drive or USB external hard disk. You can access the photos 
on such cameras just as you would data on any other USB storage device—just 
connect it to your computer, and a Nautilus window appears displaying its con-
tents. You can then transfer files via conventional drag-and-drop procedures.
Even if your camera doesn’t seem to communicate with your computer 
by either of these means, you can still get your images to your hard disk by 
removing the memory card from your camera, inserting it into a USB flash 
memory card reader, and plugging that reader into one of your computer’s 
USB ports. Once you’ve done that, your system will mount the card reader as 
if it were an external drive (which is pretty much what it is), thus allowing 
you to use simple drag-and-drop procedures to get the images to your hard 
disk. Of course, you can use this method even if your camera is supported by 
gPhoto2 or compliant with the USB Mass Storage protocol—sometimes it is 
the easiest way to deal with things anyway.
14A-1: Connecting Your Camera and Starting the Import Process
If your camera is supported by gPhoto2 and you prefer to access your photos 
directly from your camera rather than fiddle with flash storage cards (or if 
you’re just not sure whether your camera is supported or not), connect the 
USB cord supplied with your camera to the camera itself and then to one of 
the USB ports on your computer. 
Once you’ve done that, turn the camera on, and set it to communicate 
with your computer. Switching the camera to Play mode, rather than Camera 
mode, usually seems to do the trick, but you should check your owner’s 
manual just to be sure. If your camera is supported by gPhoto2, and the 
chances of that are quite good, a small window will appear, as shown in Fig-
ure 14-1. To view the images on your camera, click the Import Photos button.
Figure 14-1: Your system seeks your approval 
before importing photos from your digital camera.

14A-2: Setting Up and Cleaning Up Before Importing the Images
After you have clicked the Import Photos button in that first window, 
another window (Figure 14-2) will appear displaying the photos currently in 
your camera. In this window, you can do a little housecleaning and setup 
before actually saving photos to your hard disk.
Figure 14-2: Importing digital photos from a camera
If you would like to delete all of the photos on your camera after 
importing them, check the box next to the words Delete imported images from 
the camera. If you would like to delete only a few images before getting around 
to the business of importing, click on the image or images you want to delete 
(holding down the CTRL key if you are selecting more than one), and then 
click the Delete icon. 
As you can see, there is also an option that allows you to keep the original 
filenames assigned by your camera. You no doubt understand what this 
means, so I’ll tell you what not selecting this option means instead. When 
you import images from your digital camera, they will be saved in a folder 
and named in date-and-time format, such as 2006-02-19-19.08.13, while the 
images within that folder will be saved in numeric format, such as 0001.jpg, 
0002.jpg, and so on. If you prefer to keep the filenames assigned by your 
camera (and as they appear in the Import Photos window), check the box 
next to Keep original filenames.
Finally, there is the question of where you save these date-and-time 
named folders. The default location is in your home folder, which is con-
venient enough; however, if you take a lot of photos, you will find that 
after some time your home folder contains so many folders full of imported 
images that it is difficult to find anything. Therefore, you may want to have 
your photos downloaded to a more specific location, such as a Photos 
folder. 

222
Chapter 14
To do this, click the drop-down menu button next to the word Destination,
and select Other. This will bring up a Choose Destination Folder window. In 
that window, navigate to your Photos folder (or create one by clicking the 
Create Folder button in that window), and then select that folder by clicking 
it once. Once your selection is made, click the Open button, after which you 
will be returned to the Import Photos window with your new destination 
folder now listed in the Destination box at the top of the window. 
14A-3: Saving the Images to Your Hard Disk 
Now that everything is set up, you can save all of the photos in the Import 
Photos window by clicking the Import button. If you are in a pick-and-choose 
sort of mood, you can save only the images you want by holding down the 
CTRL key and then selecting just those images by clicking on each of them 
before clicking the Import button.
Once you have selected your photos (if you choose) and clicked the 
Import button, the images will be saved to your hard disk with the progress of 
the process indicated at the bottom of the Import Photos window. When the 
process is complete, the images you have just saved to your hard disk will 
appear in a new window, as you can see in Figure 14-3.

Viewing Your Images with gThumb
The images that appeared in Figure 14-3 are being displayed by an appli-
cation called gThumb. As you can see, gThumb is an image viewer, but it can 
actually do a lot more. Although not as elegant in appearance as Apple’s 
iPhoto, gThumb can actually perform many of the same functions, and it 
can even perform some functions that iPhoto can’t. If you don’t happen to 

Brush-Wielding Penguins
223
be importing any images from your digital camera right now and would like 
to give gThumb a look, you can do so by going to the Applications menu 
and selecting Graphics gThumb Image Viewer.
Getting to Know Some of gThumb’s Features
Now you know how to view images in gThumb, but so what, right? Well, as I 
said, gThumb does a lot more—so much, in fact, that it is a really useful tool 
for the digital photographer. With gThumb you can view your images as a 
slideshow by clicking the Slide Show button; view them at full-screen size 
(View Full Screen); rotate and mirror them (Tools Rotate Image); and 
convert their file formats, from JPEG to PNG, for example (Tools Convert 
Format). 
If you want to adjust the actual look of things, you have still more 
options. To access most of these editing options, first select the image you 
want to tackle, and then go to the Image menu and select Enhance. Once 
you’ve done that, gThumb will have a go at making your image look its 
Sunday best. 
If your aesthetic sense is a bit different than gThumb’s, you can go the 
manual route, vetoing the changes gThumb made by clicking once on the 
image and then clicking the Do Not Save button. You can then go to the 
Image menu, and change the brightness, contrast, color balance, and hue 
saturation of your image. You can also resize and crop your images from the 
same menu. 
If you want to print out one of your images, doing so via gThumb is 
extremely easy. Just click the image you want to print, and then select Print
in the File menu.
Saving Photos to CD in gThumb
One of gThumb’s very iPhoto-ish features is its ability to burn images to CD. 
To use this feature, select the images you want to save to CD (in Folder view— 
just click the Folders button to get there), and then select Write to CD in the 
File menu. After that, you will be asked in a separate window whether you want 
to save the whole shebang to disk or just those items you selected. Make your 
choice, and then click OK. A Nautilus CD/DVD Creator window will then 
appear showing the items you’ve selected. After that, it is all the same process 
as described in Chapter 6, so it is pretty much smooth sailing.
The gThumb features I’ve mentioned so far are pretty much the same as 
those found in Apple’s iPhoto. Now, however, we come to one feature that 
isn’t: gThumb’s ability to create web albums of your photo collection. These 
albums can be used on your computer itself, distributed on CDs, or uploaded 
to your website for the whole world to see . . . and they look pretty nice.
Project 14B: Creating Web Albums with gThumb

Chapter 14
14B-1: Selecting Images
To create a web album of your own, select the images you would like to add 
to your album (while holding down the CTRL key), go to the Tools menu, and 
select Create Web Album. A new window, Web Album (shown in Figure 14-4), 
will appear.
Figure 14-4: Creating a web album in gPhoto
14B-2: Selecting a Destination Folder
In the Web Album window, select a folder other than your home folder in 
which to place your web album (you’ll end up with a mess in your home 
folder if you don’t). After that, select the new folder you’ve created as the 
destination folder by clicking the drop-down menu button next to the word 
Destination and then selecting Other. In the Choose destination folder 
window that appears, navigate to the new target folder, select it by clicking 
its name once, and then click Open.
14B-3: Copying Images and Page Layout Options
Once you’ve set the destination folder for your web album, you can decide 
whether or not to copy the images in your album to the destination folder. In 
the same window, check the box next to Copy originals to destination if you 
plan to upload the web page to your website or distribute it as an archive or 
on CD. If you just plan to view the album on your own computer, leave the 
box blank. 
Once you’ve done that, decide how many images you want to appear on 
each page of your album by adjusting the numbers in the Index Layout section 
of the window. For most screen resolutions, 2 or 3 rows by 4 columns works 
very nicely.

14B-4: Adding Headers and Footers
While still in the same window, give your album a title by typing that title in 
the Header text box. You can also type a string of text to appear at the bottom 
of the page by typing text in the Footer text box.
14B-5: Choosing a Theme
Finally, choose a theme for your album by clicking the … button to the 
right of the Theme text box. As you can see in Figure 14-5, there are six 
themes available. Click on each of the themes once to see a preview of 
that theme in the right half of the window. Once you have made your 
selection, click the Select button. For my part, I will be using the Classic 
Clips theme. 
Figure 14-5: Selecting a theme for your web album
14B-6: Creating and Viewing a Web Album
Once your selections are made, you can create your web album by clicking 
the Save button. If you chose to create a web folder, a small window will 
appear, telling you that there is no such folder and asking you if you want to 
create it. Of course you do, so click Create in that window. After a few seconds, 
your web album will ready for viewing.
To see your new creation, open a Nautilus window, navigate to the 
target folder you created for your web album, double-click it, and then look 
for the file index.html within that folder. Once you’ve found it, double-
click it. Firefox will then open to your new album. You can see mine in 
Figure 14-6.

Figure 14-6: Viewing thumbnail images in a web album
As you can see, the web album presents your photos as a set of thumb-
nails in a photo or slide motif (depending on the theme you choose), with 
buttons there to connect you to whatever other pages your album happens to 
have. Click any one of the thumbnails in your web album, and that image will 
appear in enlarged form within the same window, as you can see in Figure 14-7.

One of the first things my mother asked me after she got Linux up and 
running was how to create her own emblems. You already learned how to 
deal with emblems in Chapter 7, but now that I have introduced many of the 
graphics tools at your disposal, it might be a good time to address my mother’s 
question as well.
14C-1: Using an Existing Icon as an Emblem
You can use any image as the basis of an emblem, but the easiest way to get 
started creating emblems is to use one of the icons on your system as the base. 
The only problem with that idea is that most of your system icons are 48 by 48 
pixels in size, while emblems are 36 by 36 pixels. If you don’t want your new 
emblem to look weirdly oversized and out of place, it is best to resize it.
As I mentioned in the previous section, the gThumb application is very 
handy for resizing images. For this project, we will use the gnome-tigert icon, 
so in the left pane of the gThumb window, navigate to /usr/share/pixmaps. 
Once there, look for the gnome-tigert.png file (it looks like an orange cartoon 
character), double-click it, and then go to the Image menu and select Resize.
This will bring up the Scale Image window (see Figure 14-8), where you can 
change the width of the icon to 36 pixels (the height will change automatically, 
as long as the box next to the words Keep aspect ratio is checked). Once you 
are done, click Scale.
Now you need to save the newly sized icon to your home folder, 
while keeping the original as it was. To do this, go to the File menu and 
select Save As, which will bring up the Save Image window. Save the file as 
gnome-tigert_emblem.png in your home folder. You can do this by clicking 
the drop-down menu button next to the words Save in folder and navigating 
your way home. Once that’s done, click Save.
14C-2: Adding the Newly Sized Image to the Emblem Collection
Now that you have an image of the appropriate size, it is time to add it to 
your system’s collection of emblems. To do this, open a Nautilus window, go 
to the Edit menu, and then select Backgrounds and Emblems. Once the 
Backgrounds and Emblems window opens, click the Emblems button on the 
left side of the window, and then click the Add a New Emblem button at the 
bottom of that window. This will bring up a small Create a New Emblem 
window (see Figure 14-9).
In that window, start out by giving your emblem a name. As the image is 
that of a tiger, I called mine Kitten Stuff, but you can call it something else if 
you’d like. Just type the name in the Keyword box. 
Project 14C: Emblems Again! (Creating Your Own)

228
Chapter 14
After you have done that, it is time to work on adding your new emblem to 
your system’s emblem collection. To do this, just click the big button next to 
the word Image. This will open a window from which you can select the image. 
In the text box at the top of that window, type ~/gnome-tigert_emblem.png, and 
click OK. Your new Kitten Stuff emblem should now appear in the Create a 
New Emblem window. If so, click OK.
That window should now disappear, and your new Kitten Stuff emblem 
(or whatever you called it) will appear in the Emblems window (see Fig-
ure 14-10). Now you can use your new emblem as you would any other.

Getting Arty with the GIMP
The Windows and Mac worlds may have Photoshop, but the Linux world has 
the GIMP. While arguably not as powerful as Photoshop, the GIMP is a 
capable contender, which may explain why it has been ported over to both

in gThumb

emblem to your collection

229
Mac and Windows. The GIMP allows you to create bitmap graphics and, 
quite importantly, retouch or completely doctor image files. With the GIMP 
you can get rid of red-eye in your digital photos, airbrush out unwanted 
shadows (or even facial blemishes), give your image a canvas texture, change 
a photo into an oil painting, and even add a bell pepper here and there—
and with drop shadows no less (see Figure 14-11). To run the GIMP, go to 
the Applications menu, and select Graphics GIMP Image Editor.
Figure 14-11: Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP
Using the GIMP to Resize Images and Convert File Formats
Like gThumb, the GIMP is also a very handy tool for resizing images. This 
can be done by simply right-clicking an image opened in the GIMP and then 
selecting Image Scale Image in the popup menu. This will bring up the 
Scale Image window, where you can set the new size of the image. 
The GIMP is also an excellent tool for converting images from one file 
format to another. You can, for example, open a bitmap (.bmp) file and save 
it as a PNG (.png) file, or save a JPEG (.jpg) file as a GIF (.gif) file, and so on. 
While this can also be done with gThumb, the GIMP supports an extremely 
wide variety of file formats, and it even lets you save an image file as a com-
pressed tarball, which makes it a true file-conversion king. 
To perform a file conversion, just right-click an image opened within the 
GIMP and then select File Save As in the popup menu. You can make the 
same selection from the File menu if you prefer. Either way, the Save Image 
window will then appear. In that window you can specify the new file format 

230
Chapter 14
by replacing the original file extension in the Name box at the top of that 
window with the extension for the format you want to convert the image to. 
If you’re not sure what formats are available to you, click the small arrow to 
the left of the words Select File Type, and then choose from the options in the 
pane that appears below. To save a work in progress, use the GIMP-native 
XCF format, so that you can continue working on the image later.
Dialogs
The GIMP interface, as you might have noticed, is based on a series of dialogs, 
two of which appear when you first run the application. You can, however, 
open still others, and, more importantly, you can dock those together to form 
larger single dialogs. While this is quite easy to do, figuring out how to do it is 
something that leaves many GIMP newbies at a loss. 
The various dialogs available to you in the GIMP can be found by going 
to the File menu in the main GIMP window (that’s the one that usually 
appears at the left of your screen, as in Figure 14-11), and selecting Dialogs.
From the submenu that appears, make your choice from the list of dialogs 
shown. 
After you’ve opened a couple of dialogs, you can dock them together by 
clicking and then holding the name of the dialog, located just below the title 
bar, and dragging that name to the bottom of the dialog you wish to dock it 
to. The name of the dialog will appear as a floating icon/name tab as you do 
your dragging (Figure 14-12). 
Figure 14-12: Docking dialogs in the GIMP
When the thin, gray band near the bottom of the target dialog turns 
brown (compare the bottom of the two dialogs in Figure 14-12 to see the 
difference), release the mouse button, and the dialogs will be joined as one, 
as you can see in Figure 14-13.

Learning More
It is lots of fun to learn to use the GIMP by just playing around with it for a 
while. Most of the fun stuff, to get you started, is located in the Filters and 
Script-Fu menus of any image window. Of course, you should make a backup 
copy of any file you are planning to experiment with before altering it. 
If you prefer working through manuals and tutorials to just finding 
things out by goofing around, you can download and install the GIMP User 
Manual via Synaptic by searching for gimp and then marking gimp-help-en
for installation. Once it is installed, you can access the manual from within 
the GIMP from the Help menu. If you prefer, you can just view the manual 
online at http://docs.gimp.org/en. You can also find a series of skill-level-
based tutorials at www.gimp.org/tutorials. 
XPaint
If the GIMP comes across as a bit overwhelming for you, or if it seems to be 
overkill for your simpler tasks, you might want to try out an application 
known as XPaint, which you can download and install via Synaptic (search 
for xpaint). XPaint is similar to Windows Paint and MacPaint.
Even if you are a satisfied GIMP user, there is still good reason to down-
load and install XPaint, because in addition to its simple paint tools, it can 
take screenshots of regions (Figure 14-14) rather than just of a particular 
window or of the full screen. If you have ever used the Mac OS X application 
Grab, you may well be familiar with this feature. 
By the way, once installation is complete, there will be no launcher for 
XPaint in the Applications menu, so you will have to run from the Run 
Application panel applet or from a Terminal window by typing xpaint.

Figure 14-14: Taking screenshots of screen regions with XPaint
Sodipodi
The GIMP, like other so-called paint programs, creates bitmap images in 
various file formats. These are images in which the location and color of 
every single pixel is recorded. The image is essentially a collection of dots, or 
bits. The file you create is a rather hefty map of these bits (hence its name), 
and this map tells your system where everything in your image is supposed to 
go when it is displayed or printed. 
Drawing programs, on the other hand, create vector images, or drawings. 
The vector image file is a collection of mathematical formulae representing 
the various shapes in your image. This may sound rather unimportant to you, 
but such drawings have advantages in certain cases. One of these advantages 
is that vector image files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. 
Another, and perhaps the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector 
images retain their smooth edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth 
circle created as a bitmap, for example, would begin to show jagged edges 
(“the jaggies”) when enlarged to any extent, while the same circle in a vector 
image would remain smooth and round no matter how much you increased 
its size.
If you’re interested in giving a drawing program a go, then my pick for 
creating true graphics is Sodipodi—the name is Estonian for mishmash (see 
Figure 14-15). 
To download and install Sodipodi, do a Synaptic search for sodipodi, and 
then mark the file for installation. Once it is installed, you can run it from 
the Applications menu by selecting Graphics Sodipodi.
If you would like to learn how to use Sodipodi, go to the Sodipodi home 
page at www.sodipodi.com. Be sure to click the Galleries link at the top of 
that page to see examples of what you can do with the program.

It wouldn’t be right to dedicate a whole chapter to Linux’s graphical 
capabilities without mentioning one of the newest entries in the Linux 
application arena—Picasa. Those of you coming from the Windows world 
are no doubt familiar with this very popular image viewing, organizing, and 
editing application from Google, and you will no doubt be pleased to discover 
that it is now available for Linux. Picasa is not an open source application, 
which may cause some Linux diehards to turn away, but it is free, feature 
rich, nice to look at, and decidedly cool (Figure 14-16). It also gives you easy 
access to various online photo blogs, photo finishers, and product providers, 
such as PhotoStamps, Shutterfly, Kodak, and even Walgreens. 
Picasa is not available via Synaptic, but it is available from Google as a 
DEB package. Rather than install that package via the command line, as you 
learned to do in Chapter 9, in this chapter you will learn to install Picasa (or 
any other DEB package) by means of the graphical GDebi package installer. 
NOTE
You may notice on the Picasa site that the Linux version uses Wine, which you learned 
about in Chapter 9. You do not, however, have to have Wine installed in order to use 
Picasa. Whatever bits of Wine it uses are included in the DEB package.
14D-1: Downloading the Picasa Package
To get Picasa, go to http://picasa.google.com/linux/download.html. 
On that page, click the link for the Debian/Ubuntu version of the Picasa 
package. In a separate window, Firefox will ask you what you want to do with 
the file. Select Save to Disk, and then click OK, after which the download 
will begin.

Once the picasa_2.2.2820-5_i386.deb (or newer) package is on your 
hard disk, make sure all package management software (such as Synaptic, 
the Add/Remove Programs utility, and Update Manager) is closed, and then 
double-click the Picasa package itself. This will bring up the package installer, 
GDebi (Figure 14-17).
Figure 14-17: Installing Picasa via GDebi

As you can see, the GDebi package installer looks as if it were a piece cut 
out of the Synaptic window. It provides a description of the application, details 
about the file you are attempting to install, and a list of what’s included in the 
package. To get down to the actual installation, just click the Install Package 
button. A small window will appear, telling you that you need administrative 
rights in order to proceed. Click Grant, and you will be prompted for your 
password. Type that, and click OK to begin the installation. GDebi will show 
the progress of the installation and let you know when it is done.
14D-2: Running and Setting Up Picasa
Once Picasa is installed, you can run it by going to the Applications menu 
and selecting Graphics Picasa. The first time you do this, Picasa will ask you 
if you want it to scan your entire computer for images (the default selection) 
or just your desktop. Do not, I repeat, do not accept the default (Completely 
scan my computer and all network directories for pictures). 
The reason for this warning is that even though you may have yet to add 
a single image to your computer, your system is already chock-full of them. If 
you were to accept the default, Picasa would be filled with all sorts of stuff 
that you really wouldn’t want there. It is supposed to be an organizer for your
photos, after all. With that in mind, select Only scan the Desktop, and then 
click the Continue button. Picasa will then scan your desktop for images and 
add any images it finds to its library.
Working with Picasa should be very straightforward, but if you want to 
find out more, check out http://picasa.google.com/linux. On that page, you 
will find a basic overview, links to more Linux-specific information (including 
FAQ and forum pages), and a Picasa tour.
A Few Other Graphics Apps to Consider
In addition to the graphics applications I have covered in this chapter, there 
are still more available via Synaptic (or for some easy browsing, via the Add 
Applications tool). While you can experiment with what’s available, I will 
point out a few others worth noting. If nothing else, these applications will 
give you an idea of the breadth of stuff out there waiting for you.
Blender
Perhaps one of the most impressive open source applications available today 
is Blender. Blender (Figure 14-18) is a professional-level 3D modeling, ani-
mation, and rendering program. It is rather complex, but that is the source 
of its power and popularity (it comes in versions for just about every operating 
system out there). If you would like to find out a bit more about Blender 
before taking the time (and disk space) to install it, go to www.blender3d.org. 
Find it via Synaptic by searching for blender; once the program is installed, 
you can run it from Applications Graphics Blender 3D modeller.

236
Chapter 14
Figure 14-18: Blender
QCad
Another open source application that has found its way into almost all 
operating systems is QCad (Figure 14-19). QCad is a 2D computer-aided 
design (CAD) program with which you can create technical drawings such 
as room interiors, machine parts, or even musical instruments (I’ve seen 
a plan for a Nyckelharpa done on QCad!). To find out more, go to the 
project home page at www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html. Search Synaptic for 
qcad, and install the application. Once it is installed, you can run it from 
Applications Graphics QCad.

Tux Paint
To wrap things up, let’s turn to an application for the kids (or the kids within 
us) and have a look at Tux Paint. With its big colorful buttons and fun and 
funky tools, Tux Paint, shown in Figure 14-20, is an app that your children 
can handle and enjoy. The best of Tux Paint’s features (at least in my opinion) 
are its stamps, of which there is a good variety—everything from apples to 
seahorses, and euro coins to boot! Search Synaptic for tuxpaint; launch it 
from Applications Graphics Tux Paint.

Music à la Linux
It’s now time to move on to the audio side 
of things. Yes, Linux does indeed rock, and 
in this chapter you will find out about those 
musical talents that your system possesses. The 
size of this chapter alone should be some indication of 
how much there is to offer. You will learn how to rip 
CDs, create MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files (files which you can recognize by their 
.mp3 and .ogg filename extensions), add album cover art, change file tags, 
play music files, and burn files onto audio CDs that you can play in any CD 
player. You’ll also learn how to play a variety of audio streams. If you’re 
interested in learning how to work with your iPod in Linux, how to deal 
with podcasts, and how to convert audio files from one format to another . . . 
well, you’ll have to wait until Chapter 16.
Audio File Formats
Before we go any further, it is probably best to discuss the various formats in 
which audio data can be stored on your computer. For the longest time, the 
de facto standards have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the 

240
Chapter 15
.wav extension), AU (from Sun/Unix and using the .au extension), and AIFF 
(from Apple and using the .aiff extension), all of which are uncompressed 
formats. Files saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly large, with 
an average WAV file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 10MB per 
minute. To put that in perspective, my first Macintosh back in 1988 had a 
40MB hard disk—more space than I thought I would ever need, but not 
enough space to store a WAV file of Nirvana’s “Come as You Are.”
As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines 
they are today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done 
about those disk-space-devouring audio files. Audio compression formats 
were thus developed. These compression formats worked, to oversimplify 
things a bit, by cutting out the portions of a sound signal that the human ear 
cannot hear—sort of a dog-whistle approach. The most widely known and 
embraced of these audio compression formats is MP3. Audio files encoded in 
MP3 format can end up being as little as one-twelfth the size of the original 
WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality. 
Another audio compression format that was developed was Ogg Vorbis. 
Ogg Vorbis was a product of the open source community, so, unlike MP3, 
which has always been used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent 
rights, it was free of patent and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of 
that, and the fact that it was the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and perfor-
mance (if not, as many claim, better), Ogg Vorbis became the darling of the 
Linux community. 
As you work with the audio rippers mentioned in this chapter, you are 
sure to notice yet another encoding option—FLAC. Free Lossless Audio Codec 
(FLAC) is an encoding format that, unlike MP3 or Ogg Vorbis formats, does 
not remove any audio information from the audio file during the encoding 
process. The downside of this is that FLAC only provides space savings of 30 
to 50 percent, which is much less than the 80 percent neighborhood achieved 
by MP3 or Ogg Vorbis formats. The upside, of course, is that the FLAC files 
should be equivalent to CDs in terms of quality.
Given that retention of audio quality, FLAC becomes an ideal choice if 
you are not satisfied with the audio quality provided by Ogg Vorbis or MP3 
files. It is also a good choice if you might want to create both Ogg Vorbis and 
MP3 files . . . or if you just don’t know which one you want to work with yet. In 
such cases, you can just rip the file and encode it in FLAC format. You can con-
vert the FLAC file later, when you know what you want or need. You’ll learn 
how to easily convert audio files from one format to another in Chapter 16. 
All that talk about Ogg Vorbis and FLAC aside, there are still many people 
who like or need to deal with MP3 files. You may, for example, already have 
numerous MP3 files ripped from your music collection, or you may enjoy 
listening to one of the many Internet radio streams that are broadcast in 
MP3 format. Unfortunately, MP3 playback and encoding support is not 
included in Ubuntu due to licensing concerns. Even if you plan on using 
Project 15A: Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps

241
Ogg Vorbis format in your future ripping and encoding endeavors, installing 
MP3 support is a good idea so as to cover all your audio bases. It’s also a very 
easy process.
To install MP3 playback and encoding support for most of the applica-
tions I will be discussing in this chapter (and MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC 
support for some other add-on apps), run Synaptic (System Administration  
Synaptic Package Manager), and then install the following items using the 
procedures you learned in Chapter 5: 
 gstreamer0.10-plugins
 gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
 gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse
 gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
 gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse
 gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
 gstreamer0.8-flac
 gstreamer0.8-ogg
 gstreamer0.8-lame
 gstreamer0.8-mad
 gstreamer0.8-misc
 lame
 libxine-extracodecs
You can find these items by doing Synaptic searches for three terms: 
gstreamer, lame, and libxine. After the installation is complete, open a Terminal 
window, type gst-register-0.8 (don’t use sudo), and press ENTER. After you 
close Synaptic and the Terminal window, you will be ready to start ripping 
CDs and encoding tunes at your will.
Audio Rippers and Encoders
The application you use to rip audio files from CD and encode them into 
space-saving MP3 or Ogg Vorbis formats is commonly referred to as a ripper.
For some time now, the most commonly used non–command-line ripper was 
Grip, which still has its dedicated following. Other simpler-to-use rippers, 
however, have surfaced more recently, such as RipperX, Goobox, and the 
one that comes bundled with Ubuntu: Sound Juicer.
Sound Juicer
Sound Juicer (Figure 15-1) is a relatively new program that is pretty straight-
forward to use and quite capable in terms of what it does. It isn’t perfect, 
though, and it still can be a bit quirky. In addition, unlike many of its ripping 
cousins, Sound Juicer does not automatically create a playlist for the songs 
you rip and encode, and it lacks a simple means by which to adjust the 
encoding bitrate. 

242
Chapter 15
Figure 15-1: Ubuntu’s default ripping and encoding 
application—Sound Juicer
Despite these limitations, there are still many people who prefer Sound 
Juicer to the competition, so you might as well give it a try to see how you like 
it. To get started, just place the CD you want to rip in your drive; Sound 
Juicer will start up automatically and display the title of your CD, the artist’s 
name, and titles of all the tracks in the application window.
NOTE
It is important to mention at this point that if you are not connected to the Internet, 
these bits of album information will not appear because album and track data are not 
embedded in the CD itself. What happens instead is that the audio ripper or player on 
your machine sends the digital ID of the CD you’re playing to an online database, such 
as freedb.org or CD DataBase (CDDB), which is now officially known as Gracenote. 
In turn, the online database sends the album information for that CD back to the 
player or ripper. 
You can go about things another way by going to Applications Sound & 
Video Sound Juicer CD Ripper and then placing your CD in the drive. In 
this case, however, you might have to go to the Sound Juicer Disc menu and 
select Re-read before your album and track information will appear. 
Setting the Default Folder for Ripped Files in Sound Juicer
By default, Sound Juicer is set up to rip your CDs and encode audio tracks 
in Ogg Vorbis format, and the default location in which Sound Juicer saves 
these files is your home folder. Because Sound Juicer, like all other rippers, 
will create an artist folder for each CD you rip, you will end up with a lot 
of folders in your home folder if you rip albums from a large number of 
artists. It is best to create a Music folder within your home folder, as you 
did for your graphika account, and then make that folder your default 
location for ripped music. 
To set the default from Sound Juicer, go to the Edit menu, and select 
Preferences. This will open the Preferences window where you can change 

Tux Rocks
243
the output path by clicking the menu button next to the word Folder (the 
button itself should say Home at this point) and then selecting Other in the 
menu that appears. After that, browse to your Music folder, click it once in 
the list to select it, and then click the Open button. 
Adding an MP3 Encoding Option for Sound Juicer
Although you’ve installed the files necessary to allow you to encode ripped 
tracks in MP3 format, you can’t actually start doing so in Sound Juicer with-
out performing a few extra steps. Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Go to the Edit menu, and select Preferences.
2.
In the Preferences window, click the Edit Profiles button.
3.
In the Edit GNOME Audio Properties window, click the New button.
4.
Type MP3 in the text box in the New Profile window that appears, and 
click Create.
5.
Once you are back in the Edit GNOME Audio Profiles window, click 
MP3 in the Profiles list to select it, and then click Edit.
6.
In the Editing Profile “MP3” window (Figure 15-2), type the following 
in the GStreamer Pipeline text box:
audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lame name=enc ! id3mux
Figure 15-2: Adding an MP3 encoding 
option to Sound Juicer
NOTE
There are no spaces before or after the commas in the preceding line of code. If you prefer, 
you can just copy this line from the Sound Juicer Help files. To do this, select Help  
Contents to bring up the Sound Juicer Manual window, click Preferences in the left 
pane of that window, and then scroll down in the right pane to the very end of the page, 
where you will find the line in a pink box.
7.
In the File Extension box in the same window, type mp3, and then check 
the box next to the word Active?.
8.
Close all windows, and then restart Sound Juicer.

Chapter 15
Ripping and Encoding Sound Files in Sound Juicer
To start ripping the audio tracks from the CD you have in your drive, you 
first need to select the format in which you wish to encode the tracks. To do 
this go to Edit Preferences, and then select either MP3 (MP3 audio) or CD 
Quality, Lossy (Ogg Vorbis audio) in the Output menu. Once you’ve done 
so, click Close.
After that, all you need to do is click the Extract button at the bottom of 
the Sound Juicer window to rip and encode all of the tracks on the CD. If 
there are certain tracks you do not care to rip and encode, just uncheck the 
checkboxes next to the names of those songs before you click Extract. If you 
only want to rip and encode a few of the songs in the list, it might be better to 
first go to the Edit menu, select Deselect All, and then check the checkboxes 
next to the songs you do want to rip before clicking Extract.
While the songs are being ripped and encoded, Sound Juicer will show 
you its progress at the bottom-left corner of the window, and when it’s all 
done, it will tell you so in a small window. Once you get that message, click 
Close. You can eject the CD by going to the File menu and selecting Eject.
If you want to rip and encode another CD, pop it into the drive; just as with 
the first CD, the album, artist, and song titles will all appear in the program 
window, and you can rip away yet again.
Goobox
Another ripper with a fair-sized following is Goobox (Figure 15-3). Despite 
having the simplest interface of all the rippers, it is rich in features, and those 
features are easy to understand and use. Not only does Goobox provide an 
easy means by which to switch encoding formats and adjust encoding bitrates 
for the tracks you want to rip and encode, but it is also fast. And unlike Sound 
Juicer, Goobox has no problem adding genre tags to the songs you rip.
Figure 15-3: The CD player and ripper Goobox

Tux Rocks
245
Goobox also works quite well as a CD player. Sound Juicer can serve in 
the same role, but Goobox looks as if it were made for the job. In fact, it looks 
more like a CD player that can rip and encode CD tracks than the other way 
around. It even allows you to easily download and display the album covers 
for the CDs you are playing. Because of its ripping and playback strengths, 
I changed my own system settings so that Goobox automatically appears 
when I insert an audio CD instead of the default Sound Juicer.
Downloading, Installing, and Using Goobox
You can easily download and install Goobox with Synaptic (just search for 
goobox). Once the installation is complete, you can run Goobox by going to 
the Applications menu and selecting Sound & Video CD Player.
NOTE
At the time of this writing, the current version of Goobox available on the Ubuntu 
repositories (0.9.91-1build1) does not download album track information, which sig-
nificantly limits its functionality. Hopefully, by the time this book reaches your hands, 
a new version correcting that bug will be available. For now, I’ll describe how things are 
done when everything works as it should.
To get down to ripping and encoding with Goobox, just insert your CD 
in the drive, and the tracks, with artist and titles, will soon appear in the 
Goobox window. Before ripping and encoding your CD, you might want to 
check the information that is going to be encoded in the tags for the various 
tracks you rip. These tags include the artist name, album title, track titles, 
year the CD was released, and musical genre. It is much easier to do this 
before the tracks are ripped and encoded to MP3 or Ogg Vorbis format, 
so it isn’t a bad idea to check first.
To do so, just go to the Edit menu, and select CD Properties. In the 
CDDB Track Editor window that appears (Figure 15-4), you can check things 
out and make any changes you feel are necessary. I often change the Genre 
section to make things more meaningful for me (I use Latin Pop or Latin 
Alternative, rather than just Latin, for example). You can also edit the tag 
information for privately released CDs that are not listed in online CD 
databases, CDs for which you have to input all of the information yourself.
If you want to rip only a few tracks, rather than the whole album, make 
your selections by clicking on the song titles, holding down the CTRL key while 
doing so if you want to select more than one song. If you want to adjust the 
encoding bitrate for file size or sound quality reasons, you can do so by going 
to the Edit menu, selecting Preferences, and then clicking the Encoding
tab in the Preferences window. You can make your adjustments using the 
simple sliders in that tab. 
Once you’re ready to rip, go to the CD menu, and select Extract Tracks.
A small window, shown on the left in Figure 15-5, will appear. In that window 
you can choose whether to extract just the tracks you’ve selected or to rip the 
whole album. If you click the small arrow next to the words Advanced Options,
the window will expand (see the right side of Figure 15-5), and you can 
choose the encoding format you want to use.

246
Chapter 15
Figure 15-4: Editing track information before ripping in Goobox
As I mentioned in “Setting the Default Folder for Ripped Files in Sound 
Juicer” on page 242, it is also a good idea to have Goobox save your encoded 
files in your Music folder. You can do this by clicking the menu button beneath 
the words Destination Folder and navigating to and selecting your Music folder. 
You only need to perform this step the first time out.
Figure 15-5: Extracting tracks in Goobox
Once your decisions are made, click the Extract button in the Extract 
Tracks window, and the ripping and encoding will begin. Goobox will 
show its progress in a separate window, where it will also let you know 
when it is done.

Goobox as a CD Player
As I mentioned before, Goobox works very well as a CD player. Using it in 
that capacity is straightforward enough; all you have to do is click the Play, 
Pause, Stop, Next, and Eject buttons, as you would in any other player. Also, 
like other CD players, it places a small control applet in the top panel, which 
you can click to hide and show the main player window, or right-click to 
access the playback controls while the main player window is hidden. 
To add album art for the CD you are playing, click the CD icon just 
below the Play button, and select Search on internet in the popup menu 
that appears. Goobox will display a window filled with album covers (most 
of which are seemingly identical) for you to choose from (Figure 15-6). 
Click your choice, click Apply, and then click Close.
Figure 15-6: Downloading and selecting album 
cover art in Goobox
Making Goobox the Default CD Playback Application
If you would like to change your system settings so that Goobox instead of 
Sound Juicer automatically starts up every time you insert a CD, you can do 
so by following these steps:
1.
Go to the System menu, and select Preferences Removable Drives 
and Media.
2.
In the Preferences window that appears, click the Multimedia tab.
3.
In the Audio CD Discs section of that tab, change the command from 
sound-juicer –d %d to goobox, and click the Close button.
Audio Players
Now that you know how to rip your audio CDs and encode them to space-
saving MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files, you need to use another application to play 
them. Fortunately, this is an area where Linux shines, as there is quite a 
selection of audio players available, two of which I will discuss here.

248
Chapter 15
Rhythmbox
The default audio player in Ubuntu is called Rhythmbox (see Figure 15-7). 
Rhythmbox, using Sound Juicer as its ripper/encoder, seems to function 
pretty much like a simplified version of Apple’s iTunes application, though, 
for better or worse, iTunes it is not. It is, however, a relatively easy-to-use audio 
player which, despite some quirkiness in its early stages, has developed quite 
a following in the Linux world. 
Figure 15-7: The Rhythmbox sound player
Running and Setting Up Rhythmbox
To run Rhythmbox, just go to the Applications menu, and select Sound 
and Video Rhythmbox Music Player. The first time you run Rhythmbox, 
you are greeted with a three-step setup wizard. To get through the first 
introduction screen, click Forward. In the second screen, you should tell 
Rhythmbox where it is you keep (or plan to keep) your music files. Use the 
Music folder you created in “Setting the Default Folder for Ripped Files in 
Sound Juicer” on page 242. Just click the Browse button to locate the folder 
graphically, and then click Forward in the wizard window. In the third and 
final screen, click Apply, and Rhythmbox will scan your Music folder and 
add any songs it finds there to its library. 
Adding Songs and Albums to the Rhythmbox Library 
If you are familiar with Apple’s iTunes, then you should understand the 
Library in Rhythmbox too, as it is essentially the same concept, though it 
does not physically move your files as iTunes does. 
To add new albums to your Rhythmbox library, go to the Music menu, 
select Import Folder, and then navigate to the folder for the new album you 
want to add. If you want to add a number of albums by the same artist, just 

Tux Rocks
249
navigate to and select the folder for that artist instead. If you just want to add 
a single audio file, you can also do that—just select Music Import File, and 
then navigate to the song in question.
If you are not the navigating type, you can also add files and folders by 
other means. The simplest way is to drag the folder or song you want to add 
to the Library into the right pane of the Rhythmbox window. You can also 
add a song to the Library directly by right-clicking the file and selecting 
Open With Open with “Rhythmbox Music Player” in the popup menu 
that appears. 
Rhythmbox, in conjunction with Sound Juicer, also allows you to add 
songs to the Library directly from a CD, albeit it in a somewhat indirect way. 
To do this, select Music Import Audio CD, and Sound Juicer will appear 
and display the contents of the CD you currently have in your drive. After 
that, you can rip and encode the songs as you normally would in Sound 
Juicer. Once you’re done, the songs will automatically appear in the 
Rhythmbox Library.
Browsing the Rhythmbox Library
The Rhythmbox Library is a collection of all of the music you add to it, 
which can prove to be a bit unwieldy as your collection grows. Fortunately 
Rhythmbox has a nice browser function, like the one in iTunes, that allows 
you to see lists of the artists and albums in the Library. If you click a specific 
artist in the Artist pane, a list of albums by that artist will appear in the right 
pane. You can then double-click one of the albums in that right pane to play 
it. If you want to play all of the albums you have by that artist, just double-
click the artist’s name in the left pane. All in all, a very handy feature.
If you would like to add an additional layer of categorization to the 
browser, you can do so by adding a Genre pane to the browser. To do this, 
just go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click the Library tab in 
the window that appears. After that, select Genres, artists and albums, and 
you will have a three-pane browser in the Rhythmbox window (Figure 15-8). 
Figure 15-8: The Rhythmbox browser

250
Chapter 15
Creating Playlists in Rhythmbox
Of course, you can tailor things even further so as to match every situation 
and your every mood. There are days, after all, when you’re feeling a bit too 
ethereal for Britney (and thank goodness for that). To prepare for such 
moments, you can create playlists, which are lists of songs to be played in a 
predetermined order. Just think of each playlist as an all-request radio 
station . . . where all the requests are your own. 
To create a playlist in Rhythmbox, go to the Music menu, and select 
Playlist New Playlist. When the Playlist icon appears in the left pane of the 
Rhythmbox window, type a name for the list, and then add the songs you want 
by simply dragging them from the Library pane to the Playlist icon. The songs 
themselves will remain in the Library, so you aren’t really moving anything—
just creating aliases. 
You can also create automatic playlists, which are lists that automatically 
scan the Library for songs that match your creation criteria. You could choose 
to create a list for the all the songs in your Library by a particular artist or of 
a specific genre. To do this, just select Music Playlist New Automatic 
Playlist. A window will appear in which you can specify what the list is to 
contain. You can even specify how many songs you want in the list.
Once you’ve created your lists, you can play one by clicking the list once 
and then clicking the Play button near the top of the window. You can do the 
same thing by just double-clicking the list.
Streaming Media with Rhythmbox
In addition to allowing you to play the music you have on your hard disk, 
Rhythmbox also allows you to play Internet radio streams in either MP3 or 
Ogg Vorbis format. To add a stream, click the Radio icon in the left pane of 
the Rhythmbox window, and you will come face to face with . . . well, actually 
nothing the first time around. To cure this state of emptiness, you can add 
new streams by going to the Music menu and selecting New Internet Radio 
Station. When the New Internet Radio Station window appears, type a title 
for the stream, select the genre, and then type the URL. Once you’re done, 
click Add, and the stream will appear in the right pane of the Rhythmbox 
window. 
But where do I find these radio streams, you ask? For the largest col-
lection of MP3 streams, just go to www.shoutcast.com, find a stream that 
seems interesting to you, right-click the Tune In! button for that stream, 
and then select Copy Link Location in the popup menu. After that, paste 
the URL in the URL box of Rhythmbox’s New Internet Radio Station window, 
and click Add. You can then double-click the stream in the right pane of 
the Rhythmbox window to play it.
Internet radio streams are also available in Ogg Vorbis format. Compared 
to the number of MP3 streams out there, however, the number of Ogg Vorbis 
broadcast streams is still rather limited. Things seem to be changing, though, 
and the number of Internet broadcasters who are experimenting with Ogg 
Vorbis seems to be increasing, albeit very slowly. 

Tux Rocks
251
Radio France is a good example of one of these Ogg Vorbis broadcasters. 
Radio France has a number of program streams for Internet listeners in 
Windows Media Player format, but it also provides Ogg Vorbis streams for all 
of its broadcast programs. The stream I recommend you try out is Fip, which 
is an exceedingly cool collection of music of all genres; you will be constantly 
surprised by what they play. If you are worried about language, don’t be; 
there is very little talk, and roughly 80 percent of the music played is in 
English. I don’t speak any French other than je suis fatigué, but I have no 
problems at all. 
If you want to give streaming media in general (and Radio France in 
particular) a try, type http://ogg.tv-radio.fr:1441/encoderfip.ogg in the URL 
box of Rhythmbox’s New Internet Radio Station window, and then click Add.
Assuming you are already connected to the Internet, Fip should start playing 
after a few seconds of pre-buffering.
If you would like to try any of the other Radio France broadcast streams, 
go to www.radiofrance.fr/services/aide/difflive.php#ogg, and you will find a 
list of addresses. If, on the other hand, the more traditional variety of pop 
and rock is your cup of tea, another broadcaster offering Ogg Vorbis streams 
is Virgin Radio. Virgin Radio has both standard pop/rock and classic rock 
broadcast streams. To listen to Virgin Radio, go to the Virgin Radio site at 
www.virginradio.co.uk/thestation/listen/ogg.html. Once there, click the 
appropriate link (modem or broadband) for the program stream you’d 
like to hear.
amaroK
Another somewhat recent entry into the Linux audio player arena is amaroK. 
Although actually a KDE app, amaroK (Figure 15-9) has such an attractive 
interface and such interesting and useful features that it has won over many 
converts, even within the GNOME world. Although figuring out all of its fea-
tures can be a bit confusing at first, it will become second nature in no time.
Figure 15-9: amaroK

252
Chapter 15
In case you are wondering, the name amaroK comes from the title of an 
old Mike Oldfield album of the same name. The word itself is derived from 
the Inunkitut word for wolf, which explains the logo for the application—a 
blue wolf. 
Installing and Using amaroK
To install amaroK, you need to download and install two files via Synaptic: 
amarok and amarok-gstreamer. Once you perform a search for amarok and 
mark it for installation, Synaptic will automatically mark amarok-gstreamer 
for installation as well, so you don’t really have to worry about installing it 
separately. 
Once all the necessary files have been marked, applied, and installed, 
you can run amaroK from the Applications menu by selecting Sound & 
Video amaroK. The amaroK First-Run Wizard will then appear.
The first page of the wizard is just an introduction, so the only thing you 
have to do is click Next. On the second page, you will be asked to select the 
interface you wish to use. To enjoy the full effect of amaroK (and to follow 
along with my descriptions in this chapter), accept the single-window 
default by clicking Next.
The next page of the wizard is important because it is there that you tell 
amaroK where you are keeping your music files. Doing this allows amaroK 
to add the albums, songs, and/or playlists it finds there to its Collection list 
and to update that list whenever you add or delete files from that location. 
Assuming you followed my earlier directions to create a Music folder, navi-
gate your way to that folder in the wizard window, and check the box next to 
its name. The wizard page should then look like mine in Figure 15-10. Once 
it does, click Next.
The rest of the wizard is essentially a no-brainer. Just click Next on the 
Database page, and then click Finish on the congratulatory final page. After 
that, the main amaroK player and its small panel controller applet will appear.
Figure 15-10: Telling amaroK where to find your music folder

253
Playing Songs, Building Your Collection, and Creating Playlists in amaroK
If you click the Collection tab on the left side of the amaroK window, you 
will see entries for all of the artists that amaroK found in your Music folder. 
AmaroK will automatically check the folder from time to time and make 
changes to the Collection list whenever you make changes to the Music 
folder itself. If you’ve just added something and it isn’t showing up yet, go 
to the Tools menu and select Rescan Collection. Occasionally, amaroK 
seems to be on a bender of sorts and places things where they should not be 
in the Collection pane. If this should happen, just go the Tools Rescan 
Collection route again, and things will be as they should.
To get down to the business of playing music, drag an artist, album, or 
individual song to the right pane of the amaroK window, and click the Play
button. This is also essentially the first step in building a playlist. For example, 
if you would like to create a playlist of songs you like to listen to while working, 
you would create the list using the drag-and-drop method I’ve just described 
(as I have done in Figure 15-11) and then save the list by going to the Playlist
menu and selecting Save Playlist As.
Figure 15-11: Creating playlists in amaroK
Once the playlist is saved, the Playlists pane will appear at the left side 
of the window in place of the Collection pane, showing your new playlist in 
addition to any playlists amaroK found while scanning your Music folder. 
Remember that if you are using Goobox for your ripping and encoding 
needs, playlists are automatically created for each album that you rip.
While looking at the Playlists pane, you will notice that amaroK has 
a lot of other playlists there, much like those found in iTunes, such as 
Favorite Tracks, Genres, Most Played, Newest Tracks, Random Mix, and 
on and on.

254
Chapter 15
Streaming Media with amaroK
Another one of amaroK’s capabilities is acting as a streaming media player. 
As you probably noticed when looking at the Playlist pane of the amaroK 
window, there is an entry there called Radio Streams. Clicking the + next to 
that list and the + next to the Cool Streams folder within that reveals a list of 
preset radio broadcast streams that you can listen to with amaroK. If you would 
like to add other streams to the list, you can do so by clicking the Add button 
directly above the Playlists pane and selecting Radio Stream. When the Add 
Radio Stream window appears, type a name for the stream and the URL, and 
then click OK. The stream will then appear in the Radio Streams section of 
the Playlists pane.
Displaying and Downloading Album Cover Art in amaroK
AmaroK has a lot of other cool features worth mentioning. One of these is its 
ability to download and display the album cover art for the album you are 
playing. To get the cover for an album, just play any song from that album, 
and then click the Current tab. In that tab, click the icon that looks like a 
book with a question mark on it (Figure 15-12, left), and amaroK will search 
Amazon.com for the appropriate cover. Once it has found the right cover, it 
will display it in a separate window (Figure 15-12, top). If the cover is the 
correct one, click Save, after which the cover art will appear in the Current 
tab for every song you play from that album (Figure 15-12, right). 
Figure 15-12: Fetching album cover art in amaroK

Tux Rocks
255
If amaroK cannot find the correct cover for the album in question, you 
have a couple of options. If the the album is a foreign one, you can try 
opening the Cover Manager (shown in Figure 15-13) by going to the Tools
menu and selecting Cover Manager. In that window, click the Amazon 
Locale button, and then select the locale you want. There are six choices 
available: International, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and United 
Kingdom. Once you’ve made your choice, click the square for the missing 
album cover, and see if that does the trick.
Figure 15-13: The amaroK Cover Manager
If that doesn’t work, there’s still hope, though you will have to do most 
of the work yourself. Just search the Internet for the album cover (Google’s 
Image Search is a good bet), and then download the cover to your hard disk. 
Once you’ve done that, right-click the empty cover icon for the album in 
question, select Set Custom Image in the popup menu, and then navigate 
to the image you just downloaded.
Other Cool Features in amaroK
AmaroK has still more cool features worth noting. The one that you can’t 
help but notice is that it provides an onscreen display of the track or stream 
that is playing, showing not only the title and artist of the track, but the album 
cover art as well (Figure 15-14). This is especially handy when using amaroK 
in hidden mode, which you can accomplish by using the amaroK panel 
applet as a toggle. 
Figure 15-14: amaroK’s onscreen display

Chapter 15
AmaroK can also display the lyrics to the song you are playing, though to 
be quite honest, it’s unlikely to retrieve lyrics for less popular music. To see, 
or at least try to see, the lyrics to the song you are playing, click the Lyrics tab 
(directly to the right of the Current tab) at the top of the left panel. AmaroK 
will immediately do an online search and then display its results. 
If you use the right arrow button to the right of those tabs at the top of 
the left pane, you can also navigate your way over to the Artist tab. If you click 
that tab, amaroK will do a Wikipedia search for information on the artist 
currently playing (Figure 15-15). Of course, this is not foolproof. When I 
tried it for the British band Sing-Sing, for example, I got a Wikipedia page 
on Sing Sing prison in New York. Interesting enough, I suppose. . . .

Creating Audio CDs
All this talk about encoding and listening to MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files on 
your computer is fine and dandy, but there are no doubt times when you 
would like to have your songs on a plain audio CD that you can play while 
you slog your way to work on the New Jersey Turnpike or the Ventura 
Freeway. Luckily, this is easy enough to do with the bundled application 
Serpentine.
To create an audio CD, go to the Applications menu, and select Sound & 
Video Serpentine Audio CD Creator. When Serpentine appears, add songs 
to the main pane by clicking the Add button and navigating to the songs you 
want to add. You can add any mix of songs, in any mix of audio formats. You 
can also add songs you have saved to a playlist by going to the File menu and 
selecting Open Playlist or Open Rhythmbox Playlist, depending on the type 
of playlist in question. 

Tux Rocks
257
As you add songs to the Serpentine window, the CD image in the bottom 
of the window will show you how much more space you have available on the 
disk (Figure 15-16). The default disk size is 74 minutes, which would be the 
norm for a 650MB blank CD, so if you are using a 700MB CD, change the 
setting to 80 minutes by clicking the drop-down menu button next to the 
words Disc Capacity and making the appropriate selection.
Figure 15-16: Preparing to burn an audio CD with 
Serpentine
When you have added all the songs you want to burn to the CD, click the 
Write to Disc button. Serpentine will then begin preparing the tracks to burn 
to disk. When it is ready, it will prompt you in a new window to insert a blank 
CD into your drive, so do that, and once the LED on your drive stops blinking, 
click the OK button. Serpentine will then begin burning the disk, and when 
it is done, it will automatically eject your disk and let you know in yet another 
window that the job is done. You can then take the disk, plop it in your car 
stereo or wherever else you want to play it, and enjoy the results.
Now that you know how to play Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files and Internet 
broadcast streams, it is time to help your system go a bit more mainstream 
by installing RealPlayer 10 (Figure 15-17). RealMedia streams are widely 
available on the Internet and are provided by many mainstream broad-
casters, both local and international. You can also play RealVideo streams, 
when they’re available. 
Linux users familiar with earlier versions of RealPlayer will be happy to 
know that RealPlayer 10 is much improved over previous Linux offerings. 
One of the big advantages is that RealPlayer 10 now has a working Firefox-
compatible plugin, which means that you can now listen to RealMedia streams 
that were previously unavailable because they could only be accessed through 
browser-embedded players. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, take a 
look at the example from the Radio Sweden site in Figure 15-18.
Project 15B: Listening to RealMedia Streams with RealPlayer

258
Chapter 15
Figure 15-17: RealPlayer 10 
The Radio Sweden site (www.sr.se), like many others, uses an embedded 
player for the broadcast streams it provides; however, without installing the 
proper plugin, the player cannot be used (Figure 15-18, left). But once the 
RealPlayer plugin is installed, its controls automatically appear (Figure 15-18, 
right), allowing you to use the embedded player just as you would the stand-
alone version (shown in Figure 15-17). 
Figure 15-18: Embedded media players in Firefox before and after installing 
the RealPlayer plugin
While on the topic of changes, I should also mention that RealPlayer 10 
is now theme compatible. This means that if you change your system theme 
from Human to Crux, for example, those effects take place in RealPlayer 10 
too. This means you are no longer stuck with the look that the Real folks 
provide. Yes, things just keep getting better.

Now that you know what is store for you with RealPlayer 10, it’s time to 
get down to installing it. Before we begin, however, I should mention that 
there are actually three ways to install RealPlayer. In this project, I am going 
to focus on the one that, albeit seemingly more cumbersome, is less likely to 
create problems for you down the road. It is also the standard way of doing it 
and, without question, the most legal. 
15B-1: Getting Ready to Install RealPlayer
The first phase of the installation process involves getting the RealPlayer 
file itself. Here are the steps:
1.
Open your web browser, and go to www.real.com/linux. On that page, 
click the Download RealPlayer button. 
2.
When the download is complete, be sure to place the downloaded file 
in your home folder.
15B-2: Installing RealPlayer
Once the RealPlayer file is snug in your home folder, quit Firefox, open a 
Terminal window, and then follow these really easy steps:
1.
Make the RealPlayer installation file executable (aka runnable) by 
typing chmod a+x RealPlayer10GOLD.bin and pressing ENTER.
2.
Type sudo ./RealPlayer10GOLD.bin, and press ENTER.
3.
Type your user password when prompted to do so, and press ENTER.
4.
When prompted to press ENTER to continue, press ENTER.
5.
When asked to complete the path where you want to install RealPlayer, 
type /opt/RealPlayer, and press ENTER.
6.
In the next window, to begin copying files, simply accept the default by 
pressing ENTER.
7.
When you are asked whether to allow the installer to configure system-
wide symbolic links, type Y, and press ENTER.
8.
You will now be asked to specify the prefix for symbolic links. Just press 
ENTER.
After a very short while, the installer tells you that it’s finished, and you 
will be returned to your user prompt. You can then close the Terminal 
window. You can also delete the RealPlayer binary file that you downloaded.
15B-3: Setting Up RealPlayer and Testing Your Installation
Now that Real Player 10 is installed on your machine, it is time to go through 
the final setup steps and then test it all out. You can start by going to the 
Applications menu and selecting Sound & Video RealPlayer 10. A simple 
setup wizard will appear, which you will have no trouble with on your own, 

260
Chapter 15
as all you really have to do is click the button at the bottom-right corner of 
the window four times. Once you have completed the wizard, the RealPlayer 
window will appear. Firefox will also appear at this point, opened to the 
Helix Community page and most likely informing you that your player is up 
to date. To test the installation, close the RealPlayer window, but leave 
Firefox open.
The next step is to check whether Real Player will automatically run 
when you click a link for a RealMedia stream in Firefox. To do this, go to 
www.npr.org, and click the NPR Program Stream link in the middle of the 
page. When the NPR Audio Player Preference window appears, click the 
Real link on the left. A small Firefox window will then appear, asking you 
what it should do with the file. The default should be Open with: /usr/share/
realplay. If so, click OK, but don’t check the box next to the words Do this 
automatically for files like this from now on until you know that everything is 
working as it should (a good rule of thumb regardless of what you’re doing). 
If all is as it should be, the RealPlayer window will soon appear, and the NPR 
stream will begin playing. 
Now let’s check and see if the RealPlayer plugin is working right in terms 
of embedded players. Point your browser to www.sr.se/p3/svea, and click the 
Lyssna på Svea (Listen to Svea) button. A new window will appear. If the 
window looks like the one on the right in Figure 15-18 you have a total 
success on your hands. Congratulations.
MP3 and Ogg Vorbis Streams with RealPlayer
An interesting and not unwelcome result of installing RealPlayer with the 
Firefox plugin is that you can now play MP3 and Ogg Vorbis Internet broad-
cast streams with a single click of your mouse. Go to www.shoutcast.com, and 
click the Tune In! button next to one of the streams to see what I mean. All 
very handy, you’ve got to admit.
Going to Town with RealPlayer
Now that you are all set up, you probably want some more streams to try out. 
There are plenty of sites with RealMedia streams, but let me steer you to 
some of my favorites to get you started (you may already know some 
of these):

Other Cool Audio Apps
The applications I have covered so far are only a taste of what Ubuntu has in 
store for you via its repositories. You can start out by browsing though the 
offerings listed in the Add Applications tool. You can also perform searches 
in Synaptic for other applications you hear about on the Internet or that I 
mention in this section. Try them out, keep them if you like them, or remove 
them if you don’t. After all, it doesn’t cost you anything in Linux.
To give you a starting point, I will mention a few applications that I think 
might be worth investigating.
XMMS
The X MultiMedia System (XMMS) was the original king of Linux audio 
players. Set up to look like a component stereo (with movable components!), 
XMMS (shown in Figure 15-19) is skinnable, takes up little desktop space, 
and has a variety of features beneath its simple surface. It also works quite 
well in conjunction with other audio apps. To find out more, check out my 
article at www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/04/15/xmms_tips 
.html. Search Synaptic for xmms, install it, and find it under Applications  
Sound & Video.
Figure 15-19: Different faces of the versatile audio player XMMS
Streamtuner
If you are an Internet radio junkie, there is probably no application as useful 
to you as Streamtuner (Figure 15-20). Streamtuner is, as its name implies, an 
online radio stream tuner. It works by downloading lists of available streams 
from a variety of sources, which you can then easily browse. When you find 
something you like, just select the stream, click the Play button, and the 
stream will open in the player of your choice, though it works best with 
RealPlayer or XMMS. Search for streamtuner, install it, and run the com-
mand streamtuner.

262
Chapter 15
Figure 15-20: Browsing Internet radio streams with Streamtuner
Streamripper
If you installed Streamtuner, you might also want to install Streamripper, 
which is a sort of Internet audio stream recorder. It works in conjunction 
with Streamtuner, allowing you to rip the streams you are listening to (and 
even those you aren’t listening to) and save them as MP3 files. To record a 
stream from within Streamtuner, just right-click the target stream, and then 
select Record in the popup menu. To get Streamripper, do a Synaptic search 
for streamripper (not kstreamripper) and install it.
EasyTag and Audio Tag Tool
For the true audio geek, these two applications allow you to alter the tags of 
your MP3 and Ogg Vorbis music files. EasyTag is the more full featured of 
the two, but Audio Tag Tool (Figure 15-21) has a friendlier user interface. 
Give ’em both a try and see what you think. Search Synaptic for easytag or 
tagtool, install one, and locate it under Applications Sound & Video.
LMMS
Linux MultiMedia Studio (LMMS) is a hybrid tracker/sequencer/synthesizer/
sampler that is easy to use—at least that’s what the LMMS home page 
suggests when it promises “easy music-production for everyone.” I can’t 
swear to that fact myself, as I don’t know much about apps in this genre, 
but there is a lot of hoopla about it out there in the Linux world, and it 
sure looks cool, as you can see in Figure 15-22. It sounds really cool too 
(try out the demos once you install it). Search Synaptic for lmms, install it, 
and run the command lmms.

Ubuntu and Your iPod
With all the talk in the previous chapter 
about ripping, encoding, and playing back 
audio files, you may be wondering whether 
or not you’ll be able to transfer any of those 
files to your iPod using Linux.
Well, you will be happy to know that Ubuntu does iPods, even Nanos. 
You will also be happy to know that using your iPod on your Ubuntu system is 
quite easy. All you have to do is plug your iPod into one of your computer’s 
USB ports, after which Ubuntu will automatically mount it and place an 
iPod icon on your desktop (Figure 16-1). Yes, no longer do you have to mess 
around with mount and unmount commands or editing system tables. Just 
plug in your pod, and Ubuntu will do the rest. 
Figure 16-1: A desktop

Chapter 16
Knowing Your Limits
Although you can use your iPod in Ubuntu, you should remember that 
support for such devices is still rather new. Because of that, there is likely to 
be the occasional odd moment while working with your iPod. I have been 
using mine without problems, but a friend did lose all his data when he 
managed to freeze his system doing something bizarre. The same thing 
happened to me on a Mac, so I guess that’s just the life of the pod. Anyway, 
if you do happen to lose all the data on your iPod or somehow corrupt its 
system, you can just use Apple’s iPod Updater while in Windows to bring it 
back to normal and repopulate its song library from your hard disk. 
If your iPod already has songs on it that you ripped using iTunes, you 
will be happy to know that such MP3s pose no problem. They are MP3s, after 
all. If, however, you have files encoded in iTunes’ default AAC format, you 
should be aware that Linux does not have much in the way of playback 
support. Only XMMS, installed along with the XMMS-MP4 plugin, seems to 
provide an easy way for you to play such files. As for the protected AAC files 
you might have bought from the iTunes store—well, forget about playing 
those back on Linux. Nevertheless, these playback support limits shouldn’t 
prove to be a problem—you can still add regular or protected AAC files to play-
lists, copy them to your hard disk, and delete them from your iPod in Linux. 
For a Linux diehard, however, there is one big problem with regard to 
encoded audio formats (and it isn’t a limitation only in Linux): iPods do not 
support Ogg Vorbis files. There is talk that Apple might include support in 
future iPods, but I wouldn’t hold my breath. In the meantime, you can 
quite simply convert your Ogg Vorbis files to MP3 format for use on your 
iPod, though there will be a bit of a loss in quality. (This is understandable, 
considering both formats have their own, incompatible methods of com-
pression which require the throwing out of actual music data.) Of course, 
if you originally encoded your audio files in FLAC format, this quality 
issue will be moot. You’ll learn more about this in “Converting Audio File 
Formats” on page 278.
iPod Filesystem Formats
Regardless of which iPod you’re talking about, all iPods have a formatted file-
system, just like your hard disk. In fact, with the exception of the Shuffle and 
the Nano, they actually have hard disks inside them. The filesystem format 
that is in place on your iPod depends on which system you originally used it 
on. If you first used it on a Mac, it will be in Apple’s HFS+ file format. If you 
first used it on your Windows machine, it will be in Microsoft’s FAT32 format. 
Actually, in the short term, it doesn’t matter which filesystem your iPod 
was formatted by; Ubuntu will usually mount either one, allowing you to 
browse through all the files on your little white beastie. If your iPod is HFS+ 
formatted, however, browsing and exporting tracks is just about all you will be 
able to dependably do, assuming your system does mount it. It is important 
that your iPod be FAT32 formatted if you want to really use it as you would in 
Windows or, ironically, Mac OS.

267
Determining Your iPod’s Format
How do you know whether your iPod is HFS+ or FAT32 formatted? Well, as I 
said, it is basically a matter of knowing which system you’ve been using your 
iPod with up until now. When you first plugged your fresh, out-of-the-box iPod 
into your computer, it really couldn’t do anything yet. At that time, your 
Windows or Mac system popped up some wizard asking you to run the iPod 
Updater tool. That tool is primarily a formatter, which formats your device in 
FAT32 if you’re running it in Windows and HFS+ if you’re running it on a Mac.
If you’ve been a two-OS sort of person up until now and have been 
happily using your iPod on both a Mac and a Winbox, then you can be sure 
that your iPod was formatted using FAT32, because Windows spews out chalk 
spittle when it tries to deal with anything that Microsoft itself didn’t create. 
In other words, Windows can’t read drives formatted by HFS+, while Mac OS 
can read both HFS+ and FAT32 drives. If you are using an iPod Shuffle, 
you can also be sure that it is FAT32 formatted, because all iPod Shuffles 
are—period. 
Of course, if you’re a prove-it-to-me kind of person, you can seek truth 
from facts by going to the Applications menu, selecting Accessories Text Editor, and then opening the file /etc/mtab in the text editor to 
reveal the format of your iPod. Just look for a line that says something like
/dev/sda2 /media/ipod or /dev/sdb2 /media/ipod and see what is listed to the 
right of that. If it says vfat, then you know your device is FAT32 formatted. 
If not, well . . . you’re just going to have to change it.
Reformatting Your iPod
And how do you change your iPod from HFS+ to FAT32 format? First you’re 
going to have to find a machine running Windows XP (preferably Service 
Pack 2 for more recent iPods) and a recent edition of iTunes. Once you’ve 
found your machine, you need to go to www.apple.com/ipod/download and 
download the most recent Windows version of the iPod Updater you can find 
there. Once you’ve downloaded and installed the updater, you will be asked 
if you would like to restart your machine (because the updater requires you 
to do so). Just say no for the time being, and plug your powered-up iPod into 
one of the machine’s USB ports. Windows will go through one of its found-
new-hardware scenarios and then ask you to restart the machine. This time 
you can agree to it, so go ahead.
When the machine starts up again, the iPod Updater will automatically 
detect that you have an iPod in a non-Microsoft format connected to the 
machine and ask you if want to update it. You do, so click Yes, after which 
the iPod Updater will appear (Figure 16-2). 
Before you go any further, make sure that you have everything on that 
iPod backed up somewhere, because the updater is going to reformat your 
iPod, and that means that it is going to wipe it clean. Of course, if the iPod is 
sort of a backup of what you’ve got on your computer already, this shouldn’t 
really be an issue. Once you are ready to roll, just click the Restore button in 
the Updater window, and then click Restore again in the confirmation 
window that appears.

268
Chapter 16
Figure 16-2: The iPod Updater in Windows
When the process is complete, run iTunes to perform the final setup 
steps. If your iPod does not soon appear in the left pane of the iTunes 
window, close all your applications, restart the system, and run iTunes again. 
Your iPod should appear in iTunes this time around. When it does, iTunes 
will present you with a brief wizard that you can pretty much handle on your 
own. The only direction I will give here is that when you come to the wizard 
page that asks you if you want iTunes to automatically update your iPod with 
your photo and music collections, deselect the two checkboxes; doing 
otherwise could lead to unwanted weirdness down the line. 
Once the process is done, you will have a properly configured, FAT32-
formatted, and all but empty iPod that is ready for use in Linux, Windows, and 
Mac OS. You can even use your iPod now on all three systems interchangeably, 
though I would only do so if the auto-update function is disabled.
Auto-Updating Your iPod
When you enable auto-update on your iPod via iTunes, the function is set up 
within your iPod itself. With a FAT32-formatted iPod, you can use your iPod 
on a Winbox, Mac, or Linuxbox—or all of them interchangeably. If you set 
up your iPod to auto-update songs and playlists, however, you are leaving 
yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly the same music collection 
on your Linux, Mac, and Windows machines.
The reason for this is simple. While iTunes allows you to add files to your 
iPod, it does not allow you to copy files from it. The auto-update feature is thus 
strictly a one-way street. This means that when you hook up your auto-update–
enabled iPod to an iTunes-enabled computer, iTunes will automatically add 
the tracks in its library to your iPod, and, more frighteningly, it will remove any 
tracks from your iPod that are not present in its library. I learned this the hard 
way when I took my wife’s loaded iPod to work and plugged it into my office 
Winbox with its completely empty iTunes library. When I brought the little 
podster back home to her with nothing at all on it, what ensued wasn’t pretty. 
If you have an iPod that is already in FAT32 format, it is best for you to 
disable the auto-update function on your iPod while it is connected to your 
Winbox, before bringing your iPod into the Linux world. To do this in 
Windows, just go to the iTunes Preferences (while your iPod is connected), 
click the iPod tab, and then select Manually manage songs and playlists
(Figure 16-3).

iPod via iTunes in Windows
Managing Your iPod in Ubuntu
Normally in Windows and Mac OS, you load files to your iPod via iTunes, 
but, of course, since Apple has not created a Linux version of that popular 
application (and I doubt it ever will), you will have to find some other way to 
go about things. Fortunately, there are a few Linux applications that can 
work to various degrees with your iPod, including two you learned about in 
Chapter 15: amaroK and Rhythmbox. 
In fact, Rhythmbox is set as the default application for iPods in Ubuntu, 
and as such it will automatically appear once your iPod is connected to your 
machine and mounted by your system. All you have to do then is click the 
IPOD icon in the left pane of the Rhythmbox window, and you can see the 
contents of your iPod. Click the small arrow to the right of the IPOD icon in 
the left pane, and you can also see your collection of playlists. But other 
than all that seeing, there isn’t much more you can do with your iPod via 
Rhythmbox.
However, there are a few other applications, specifically designed for 
use with your iPod, that are arguably a bit more useful. These are the de facto 
Linux standards (in the GNOME world, anyway): gtkpod and YamiPod, a 
freeware entry, available in Linux, Windows, and Mac versions.
Managing Your iPod’s Audio Files in gtkpod
The most commonly used Linux application for iPod file handling is gtkpod, 
which is shown in Figure 16-4. It is a pretty straightforward application with a 
fairly large user base, which means you should be able to get a lot of questions 

270
Chapter 16
answered in Ubuntu and other Linux online forums should you have any. It 
also handles most of the functions that one uses when dealing with an iPod, 
including album cover art (but it does not handle photos other than that).
Figure 16-4: Managing your iPod with gtkpod
Downloading, Installing, and Running gtkpod
Of course, in order to use gtkpod, you first have to download and install it. 
You can do this via Synaptic by doing a search for gtkpod and then installing 
gtkpod-aac following the installation steps in Chapter 5. If you didn’t install 
the list of files mentioned in Project 15A on page 240, now would be a good 
time to do so. After that, plug your iPod into one of your computer’s USB 
ports, if you haven’t already. Once your iPod is mounted (once the desktop 
icon appears and Rhythmbox opens) go to the Applications menu, and 
select Sound & Video gtkpod. You can close Rhythmbox if you like.
Using gtkpod
When the gtkpod window opens, you should see two entries in the left pane: 
one called Local and another with the name of your iPod. Sometimes there 
will be some other name there instead. Mine read amaroK, for some unknown 
reason. If you find yourself facing a similar naming mismatch, just change 
the name for the top entry so that it matches that of your iPod.
Once you’ve come to grips with the name thing, display the contents of 
your iPod by clicking the entry for your iPod in the left pane and then clicking 
the Read button. The contents of your iPod will appear in the right pane. If 
you have any playlists on your iPod, you can also click the small arrow to the 
left of your iPod’s name in the left pane of the window, which will reveal the 
lists you have created.

Pluggin’ In the Penguin
271
You can add new songs or folders full of songs by clicking the +File or 
+Dirs buttons below the menu bar and then navigating to the items you want 
to add. You can also create playlists either by clicking +Playlists to create a 
playlist of the contents of a particular folder, or by clicking the New PL
button to build your own playlist. 
In the case of the latter method, a new list will appear in the Playlists 
pane at the left side of the window, after which you just drag the songs you 
want from the right pane in order to build your list. Just be sure to drag the 
files directly onto the playlist icon, as gtkpod can be a bit finicky in this 
department. You can also add songs to existing lists in the same way. 
While on the topic of dragging and dropping, it is worth noting that 
you can add songs to your iPod library by simply dragging them from your 
Music folder (or any other folder) and then dropping them in the right pane 
of the gtkpod window. If you want to add a song to both your iPod’s library 
and a specific playlist, drag a file or directory from your Music folder to the 
icon of the playlist in question. Pretty cool.
Album Art and Tag Handling
Tag editing, including album cover images, is another area in which gtkpod 
can prove quite useful. Click any track in the playlist, select Edit Details, and 
the Details window for that track will appear (Figure 16-5). In that window 
you can edit all of the tag entries (artist, album, track title, genre, and so on), 
and, very importantly, you can set the album cover art for the track. Once 
you have finished making your changes, click the Apply button, and then 
click OK.
Figure 16-5: Editing tags in gtkpod
Copying Files from Your iPod to Your Hard Disk
A handy feature of gtkpod that isn’t available in iTunes (at least not without a 
special freeware plugin) is the ability to copy songs from your iPod to your 
hard disk. To do this, select the tracks or playlists you want to export (hold 
the CTRL key to make multiple selections or use the tabs to select whole artists 

272
Chapter 16
or genres if you like), click the File menu, and select Export Tracks from 
Database. A submenu will then appear, showing three choices: Selected 
Playlist, Selected Tab Entry, or Selected Tracks. Choose the entry that matches 
your selections. 
This approach works well enough, but it doesn’t seem to work for AAC 
files. In that case, just drag the file in question from the gtkpod window to 
your desktop, and the file will automatically be copied there. That file, how-
ever, will not have its original filename. It will have an odd name, such as 
INEI.m4a or OSPO.m4a. The files exported in this manner are themselves 
fine; all you need to do is rename them as you would rename any other file 
(right-click the file, and then select Rename—in case you forgot).
Playing Tracks on Your iPod with gtkpod
It is possible to use gtkpod in order to play the tracks on your iPod, though 
gtkpod must use a helper application to do this, as it has no playback capa-
bilities of its own. The default helper app for this purpose is XMMS, which 
isn’t a bad choice—especially if you want to have headache-free AAC file 
support. Of course, if you haven’t installed XMMS, the default setup won’t 
do you any good. You must, therefore, either choose a different helper app, 
such as Rhythmbox or amaroK, or run Synaptic, doing a search for xmms
and installing xmms and xmms-mp4 (if you want AAC playback support).
If you decide to change the audio helper application for gtkpod, open 
the gtkpod Preferences window by going to the Edit menu and selecting 
Edit Preferences. Once in the Preferences window, click the Tools tab, and 
then click the uppermost Browse button. In the window that appears, scroll 
up and select rhythmbox or amarok (depending on which you prefer). 
Once your choice is made, click the OK button, and then once back to 
the Preferences window, repeat the process, this time clicking the second 
Browse button. Click Apply and then OK to record your changes and close 
the Preferences window. 
Finishing Up the Job with gtkpod
Once you’ve done all you want to do with gtkpod, click the Sync button to 
record the changes to your iPod. You can then quit gtkpod. After that, right-
click the desktop icon for your iPod, and select Unmount Volume. When the 
desktop icon disappears, you can disconnect your iPod from your computer. 
Using YamiPod for Your iPod File Management Needs
A relative newcomer to the iPod file management arena is YamiPod. YamiPod, 
which also comes in Mac and Windows versions, looks like a cleaned-up 
version of gtkpod; YamiPod’s layout is more straightforward, making it easier 
to use in many ways. It also allows audio-direct, helper-less playback (which 
gtkpod doesn’t), and it is easier to deal with in terms of playlist creation and 
handling.

Downloading, Installing, and Running YamiPod
To get YamiPod, you’ll need to download it yourself from the project’s 
website at www.yamipod.com. Just go the site’s Downloads page, and then 
download YamiPod to your hard disk. The file will appear on your disk as a 
tarball, so first extract the tarball, and then move the yam-linux folder, which 
is the product of that extraction, to your home folder. Once you’ve done 
that, there is one small chore you need to perform before you can run the 
application: copying the libfmodex file within the yam-linux folder to the 
/usr/lib folder. Since /usr/lib is in protected territory, you will have to use 
the sudo command to perform the copy procedure.
Here are the steps:
1.
Open a Terminal window, type cd yam-linux, and press ENTER.
2.
In the same Terminal window, type the following command, and press 
ENTER (and make sure to leave a space on either side of cp and between 
so.* and /usr):
sudo cp libfmodex.so.* /usr/lib
3.
When prompted for your password, type it, and press ENTER. When your 
user prompt reappears, you can close the Terminal window.
As YamiPod itself is an executable binary file, you don’t have to install it 
to put it to work, and you are now ready to step into action. To get things 
under way, plug your iPod into one of your USB ports, and then double-click 
the YamiPod file within the yam-linux folder. YamiPod will appear as a small 
window until it reads the contents of your iPod, after which the window 
should expand into something like the window in Figure 16-6. 
Figure 16-6: Managing your iPod with YamiPod

Chapter 16
Using YamiPod 
Working with YamiPod is very simple. To add songs to your iPod, just drag 
tracks or folders from your Music folder to the bottom pane of the YamiPod 
interface or to any open playlist in the playlist pane. An Add To Ipod window 
(Figure 16-7) will appear, showing the tag information for each of the songs 
you’ve just dragged over. In that window you can edit the tags for each of 
the songs, if you’d like to, before adding them to the library. When you’ve 
finished making your changes, just click the Add All button, and the songs 
will be immediately added to your iPod’s library.
Figure 16-7: Adding songs to your iPod with 
YamiPod
To create a playlist, click the + button near the top-right corner of the 
window, and name your list in the New Playlist window that appears. Once 
you’ve made your choice, click OK. You can then drag the tracks you want to 
add to the list from the main library pane in the bottom half of the window. 
You can also drag files directly from your Music folder to the Playlist pane, 
thereby adding those tracks to the playlist and your iPod’s library at the 
same time. 
If you would like to remove a track from the library, just right-click 
the track in question, and then select Delete song in the popup menu. 
To remove a playlist, just select the targeted list from the drop-down menu 
button at the right-top corner of the window, and then click the – button to 
the right of that.
Finishing Up Your YamiPod Session
Since YamiPod performs changes to your iPod in real time as you perform 
those changes within the YamiPod window, wrapping things up is quite 
simple. Just click the small, circular eject button at the very bottom-right 
corner of the YamiPod window. YamiPod will then close, and your iPod will 
be automatically unmounted.

275
Exporting Files from Your iPod with YamiPod
Like gtkpod, YamiPod allows you to export files from your iPod to your hard 
disk. To copy songs from the library in YamiPod, select the tracks you want to 
copy in the main library pane (and hold down the CTRL key while doing so if 
you are making multiple selections), right-click any one of the selected files, 
and then select Copy song to in the popup menu.
Podcasts
Although both YamiPod and gtkpod allow you to copy podcasts to your iPod, 
neither application provides you with a list of available podcast feeds. YamiPod 
does have a feature by which it can download the feeds you want if you provide 
the URL, but I don’t recommend doing that, as it seems to crash the program. 
The result of these facts is that if you want to look for podcasts and add 
them to your iPod’s library, you will have to do a little more work than you’re 
used to. One application that can help is iPodder (Figure 16-8), which you 
can download and install via Synaptic by doing a search for ipodder, and 
then . . . well, you know the steps by now.
Figure 16-8: iPodder podcast browser and receiver
Once you select and download your podcasts, iPodder will place them in 
the downloads subfolder of the iPodderData folder that it creates for you in 
your home folder. To add these podcasts to your iPod in gtkpod, create a 
playlist called Podcasts (if there isn’t one there already), and then add the 
podcast file to the playlist, as you would any audio file, by simply dragging it 
onto that playlist.
You can add podcasts to your iPod via YamiPod in almost the same way. 
Just select the Podcasts playlist from the drop-down menu button at the top-
right corner of the YamiPod window, and then drag the file to the top-right 
pane of the window.

Setting Up Your System to Automatically Launch YamiPod or gtkpod
If you like, you can set up your system so that YamiPod or gtkpod automatically 
launches when you plug your iPod into one of your USB ports. To do this, go 
to the System menu, and select Preferences Removable Drives and Media.
When the Preferences window appears, click the Multimedia tab, and then 
check the box next to the words Play music files when connected in the iPod 
section of that tab. In the Command box, type gtkpod if you want to use that 
application, or if you prefer YamiPod, click the Browse button and navigate 
your way to the YamiPod binary file within your home folder. Once you’re 
done, the Preferences window should look something like Figure 16-9. 
If so, click Close.

Photo Transfer with GPixPod
Ever since the iPod Photo appeared in 2004, iPods have been able to display 
photos. Unfortunately, until recently there was no simple way to transfer pho-
tos from your computer to your iPod in Linux. Things have, quite fortunately, 
changed since the appearance of a handy application called GPixPod. GPixPod 
(Figure 16-10) is, admittedly, an application still in development. Nevertheless, 
it should work on all color iPods, though it is not yet fully compatible with the 
original iPod Photo. Since version 0.4.1, it also seems to work with the Nano.
You can get GPixPod from its project page at http://sourceforge.net/
projects/gpixpod. Click the Download GPixPod button, and then on the 
next page that appears, click the Download button. On the next page, click 
the gpixpod-0.4.4_all.deb (or newer) link, which will bring you to a list of 
mirrors. Select the one closest to you, and then wait for the GPixPod 
download to complete.

Pluggin’ In the Penguin
277
Figure 16-10: Adding photos to your iPod with GPixPod
Once the gpixpod-0.4.4_all.deb package is on your hard disk, you have 
to install it. Rather than resort to the command line, as you did when 
installing DEB packages back in Chapter 9, let’s go the easy route by just 
double-clicking the package itself. This will bring up the package installer, 
gdebi (Figure 16-11).
NOTE
Make sure that neither Synaptic nor the Add/Remove Applications utility are open 
when running gdebi, as only one package management tool can run at a time.
Figure 16-11: Installing GPixPod via gdebi

278
Chapter 16
As you can see, the gdebi package installer looks like a piece cut out of 
the Synaptic window. It provides a description of the application, details 
about the file you are attempting to install, and a list of what’s included in 
the package. To get down to the actual installation, just click the Install 
Package button. A small window will appear, telling you that you need 
administrative rights in order to proceed. Click Grant in that window (the 
equivalent of typing your password when using Synaptic), after which the 
installation will begin. Once GPixPod is installed, you can run it by going 
to the Applications menu and selecting Graphics GPixPod.
NOTE
You cannot add photos to the GPixPod interface without first connecting your iPod to 
your system. You should also note that you can not view images added to GPixPod’s 
database in the right pane of the application window until you save your changes by 
clicking the Save button.
Converting Audio File Formats
If you would like to convert MP3 to Ogg Vorbis format or vice versa, 
SoundConverter (shown in Figure 16-12) is an application that makes 
it all quite simple. Because SoundConverter does not come bundled with 
Ubuntu, you will have to install it yourself (if you didn’t install it in Chapter 5). 
To do so, just run Synaptic, search for soundconverter, and install it.
All you have to do to use SoundConverter after that is add the songs you 
want to convert to the main pane by clicking either the Add File or Add Folder
buttons. If you prefer, you can also drag files from your Music folder (or 
wherever else you store your audio files).
Figure 16-12: Converting audio file formats with 
SoundConverter

Pluggin’ In the Penguin
279
Once you’ve chosen the files to convert, you need to choose which format 
to convert them to. You can do this by clicking the Preferences button and 
then making your choice in the Preferences window (Figure 16-13). While 
you’re there, it is also a good idea to tell SoundConverter to place your con-
verted files in a location other than the folder where the original files are 
stored. Doing this prevents having to deal with duplicates in Linux audio 
playback applications that automatically scan your Music folder, such as 
amaroK. This is not an issue in either gtkpod or YamiPod, as they will not 
allow you to add Ogg Vorbis files to their library lists. You might also want 
to check the box next to the words Create subfolders in order to keep things 
organized. Once you have set things up and are ready to convert, click Close
in the Preferences window, and then click Convert in the main window. 
SoundConverter will then begin doing its stuff.

Video and DVD Playback in Ubuntu
Now that we’ve covered much of what 
Ubuntu can do in terms of audio, let’s 
turn our attention to what is arguably the 
second most important of its talents in our 
CNN/MTV–era world: video. Ubuntu is quite capable 
in terms of video playback, allowing you to view video 
files you download from the Internet or from your digital movie camera, 
video CDs (VCDs), unencrypted DVDs (encrypted ones, too, with a little 
more work up front), and some Internet video streams. It even allows you 
to download movies from your digital video camera and then edit them.
Playing Video Streams with RealPlayer
In Chapter 15, we covered RealPlayer’s role as an audio application that 
allows you to play Internet audio streams. Audio streams are not the only 
thing that RealPlayer can handle, however; you can use it to play video streams 
as well. If you would like to try out RealPlayer’s capabilities for playing video 
streams, or if you just happen to be a fan of Katie Holmes, point your web 
browser to www.katieholmespictures.com/movies.shtml, scroll down to the 

282
Chapter 17
Videos section, and then try out one of the many clips available there. Once 
you have made your selection, RealPlayer will pop up and begin playing the 
stream in a slightly enlarged window.
If the Beatles are more your cup of tea, try “The Birth of Beatlemania” 
at NPR’s All Songs Considered site (www.npr.org/programs/asc/archives/
beatles40). Be sure to click the Real Video link on that page. Firefox will 
then pop up one of its what-should-I-do-with-this-thing windows with Movie 
Player listed as the default player. Movie Player doesn’t do as good a job 
with RealMedia streams, so you definitely want to change things. In that 
window, click the drop-down menu button, which at this point says Movie 
Player, and select Other. When the Choose Helper Application window 
appears, double-click File System in the left pane of the window, navigate 
your way to /opt/RealPlayer in the right pane, and then scroll down until 
you find the file realplay. When you find it, click it once to select it, and then 
click Open. Once back in that original what-should-I-do window, check the 
box next to the words Do this automatically for files like this from now on. Your 
window should look like that in Figure 17-1. If so, click the OK button, after 
which RealPlayer will start up and play the stream.
Figure 17-1: Telling Firefox what to do with the 
RealAudio document
If you would like to view the video at an enlarged size, you have two 
ways of going about it. The first and easiest way is to drag one of the bottom 
corners of the RealPlayer window until it is the size you prefer. The other way 
is to go to the View menu and select Fullscreen or Zoom Double Size.
DVDs
Your system also allows you to play DVDs; however, due to licensing concerns, 
playback is limited to unencrypted disks. Unfortunately, this rules out a vast 
majority of the DVD movies you buy or rent at your local video shop and 
leaves you with a rather limited choice of movies that you can play on your 
computer. Of course, DVDs created on personal computers (such as the 
DVD slideshows that people create these days with applications such as iDVD 

Couch Penguins
283
on the Mac) pose no problem. Given the limited offerings in the unencrypted 
DVD world, you will no doubt want to enable your system to play back the 
encrypted variety, so you will learn to do so later in this chapter. 
Can I Play Foreign DVDs?
Your computer can play DVDs of any broadcast standard (NTSC, PAL, or 
SECAM) and of any regional encoding. This is a better setup than that DVD 
player you have hooked up to your TV, because the vast majority of stand-
alone DVD players in the United States (and I would venture to guess that 
the size of that majority is 99.9 percent) do not allow you to play anything 
other than Region 1 NTSC disks (NTSC being the broadcast standard in 
the United States and what its televisions are designed to display, while the 
DVD region is 1). This information is usually provided on the back of DVD 
packages (see examples in Figure 17-2), though the packaging for most disks 
produced for the US market does not include it.
Figure 17-2: Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages 
Despite the wonderful everything-goes nature of your computer in terms 
of DVD playback, there is a serious caveat to bear in mind. Depending on the 
manufacturer of your DVD drive, you will only be able to switch back and 
forth between DVDs of differing regional encodings four or five times. After 
that, the drive will be locked into the regional encoding of the disk you were 
playing at that time . . . forever. This is unrelated to your operating system—it 
is strictly a hardware matter. The only exception to this region-lock rule are 
those DVDs labeled Region Free or ALL (sometimes inaccurately labeled as 
Region 0), which can be played on any DVD player in any region, and thus 
do not register as a regional encoding switch when you plop one of them in 
your computer’s DVD drive. 
If your drive does eventually lock into one regional encoding, especially 
one for which you have few DVDs, there is some good news. That news comes 
in the form of Videolan’s libdvdcss2, the library you will install in the following 
project which will allow you to play back encrypted DVDs. In addition to that 
primary function, libdvdcss2 also, in theory, allows you to play back DVDs from 
multiple regions even if your DVD drive is already locked into one region. It 
does this by performing a cryptic attack (to use Videolan’s term for it) on your 
drive until it can find the disk key for that drive. Of course, this process of 
cryptic bombardment can take several minutes, so it is not the optimal way 
of going about things. Better than being stuck, though. Whether or not this 
process of bypassing regional encodings is legal remains a subject of debate, 
so if you are concerned about such things, you should do a little research.

284
Chapter 17
As I already mentioned, Ubuntu does not allow you to play encrypted DVDs 
from the start. In order for you watch such DVDs (and that would be the vast 
majority of them), you need to install a whole bunch of stuff, with the package 
libdvdcss2 being the most crucial of all. Fortunately, if you installed all of the 
files I mentioned back in Project 15A on page 240, you are almost there—
all you need is libdvdcss2. Of course, if you didn’t install those files back in 
Project 15A, you’d better do so now, because you won’t be able to go on 
without them. 
You can get the libdvdcss2 file by running a script that is included in 
one of those packages I was just nagging you about—gstreamer0.10-plugins, 
to be exact. That script will download, install, and set up the libdvdcss2 file for 
you. To run the script, close all open package-management software windows 
(Synaptic, the Add/Remove Programs utility, or Update Manager), open a 
Terminal window, and then type the following line:
sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
Once you’ve typed that line and pressed ENTER, you will be prompted for 
your password. Type it, press ENTER, and the script will begin its job of down-
loading, installing, and then setting up libdvdcss2, with the progress of each 
of these steps shown in the Terminal window. You will know the installation 
and setup are complete when your cursor is once again blinking at your user 
prompt. You are then ready for some real DVD viewing.
Totem Movie Player
The default video player in Ubuntu is Totem, and now that you have 
installed libdvdcss2 in Project 17, you can actually put it to some good 
use. Totem, as you can see in Figure 17-3, has a very simple interface, 
which makes using it equally simple. You can run Totem by going to the 
Applications menu and selecting Sound & Video Movie Player. You can 
also run it by simply placing a DVD in your drive, because Ubuntu is set up 
to run Totem any time you do so. If you don’t happen to have a DVD on 
hand but you want to see Totem in action, you can also bring it up by 
double-clicking that Ubuntu video that comes with your system in the 
Examples folder (Experience Ubuntu.ogg).
Switching Totems
Before going on any further, I should mention that Totem, despite all that 
simplicity I talked about, can be an absolute pain in the proverbial posterior. 
You may be one of the lucky ones, but for me and many others, Totem is as 
cooperative as a crocodile in your local swimming hole. The problem is not 
actually Totem itself, but rather the gstreamer back end that performs its 
video processing. 
Project 17: Installing Support for Encrypted DVDs

Couch Penguins
285
Figure 17-3: Totem Movie Player
Totem, you see, is merely a graphical front end that provides you with an 
easy way to use software that works in the background—a back end, which in 
this case is gstreamer. All is not lost, though, because there is a version of 
Totem that utilizes the Xine video-processing back end instead of gstreamer. 
That much more cooperative version is available via Synaptic. 
If you find yourself having problems with Totem as is, I strongly 
recommend installing the Xine version. To do this, run Synaptic, search 
for totem-xine, and install the back end. Once you’re done, you won’t notice 
any changes up front. You will have the exact same Totem interface in the 
exact same menu location, but you’ll be a much happier camper because 
Totem will then work as it’s supposed to. You will experience, among other 
things, superior sound (or at least better volume), more dependable DVD 
playback, and less quirky playback of Windows Media Video (WMV) files.
Using Totem to Play DVDs, VCDs, and Other Multimedia Files
As I already mentioned, you can play a DVD in Totem by simply placing your 
DVD in the drive, after which Totem will open and begin playing your movie. 
If you’ve got a copy of Red Detachment of Women on VCD that you’re aching to 
watch, you can do so in the same way. Just pop the VCD in your drive; Totem 
will start up and begin playing it. 
Totem not only plays DVDs and VCDs, but it can also play MPEG files 
and, because you installed that big cocktail of packages I keep going on 
about, it can play WMV files too. You can play such files by either double-
clicking them directly or going to the Totem Movie menu, selecting Open,
and then navigating to the video file you want to view.
Making Things Look a Bit Better in Totem
One thing you may notice when using the Xine version of Totem is that 
videos seem to look a bit washed out. This can be easily fixed by going to the 
Totem Edit menu and selecting Preferences. In the Totem Preferences 

286
Chapter 17
window, click the Display tab, and then lower the Brightness and Contrast
sliders to points similar to those shown in Figure 17-4. You can, of course, 
change things to suit your own tastes. Once you’re done, click Close.
Figure 17-4: Adjusting brightness and 
contrast settings in Totem
Totem as an Audio Player?
You may have noticed while in the Display tab of the Preferences window that 
there was a Visual Effects section. Well, those visual effects aren’t for the videos 
you play, but rather are visualizations to accompany your audio files when 
played via Totem (Figure 17-5). Yes, Totem not only does video, it does audio 
as well. In fact, it is, somewhat oddly, the default audio player for Ogg Vorbis 
and MP3 files in Ubuntu. Just double-click one of those files, and sure enough, 
Totem will be the application that pops up, blasting your ears out with your 
favorite melodies. Of course, you can also play such files from the Totem 
Movie menu, by selecting Open and then navigating to the songs you want 
to play. If you have a CD in your disk drive, you can even use Totem as a CD 
player by going to the Movie menu and selecting Play Disc ‘Audio Disc’.

A Couple of Other Cool Totem Features
There are a couple of other cool features in Totem that you might like to 
know about. One is its ability to perform screen captures of whatever video 
you happen to be viewing at the time. Just go to the Edit menu, select Take 
Screenshot, and you’ve got yourself a screen capture—a still image taken 
from a video file.
Another feature worth mentioning is Totem’s Sidebar. As you no doubt 
noticed, at the bottom-right corner of the Totem window, there is a Sidebar 
button. If you click that button, a new pane will open at the right side of the 
Totem window. In that pane you can load, create, and save playlists. Such lists 
can consist of any combination of supported video or audio files, thus provid-
ing you with the whole multimedia banana. Any time you play a file in Totem, 
that file appears in the Playlist pane, but you can also add items to the list by 
simply dragging the files there from your desktop or any Nautilus window.
Using Your Digital Video Camera
Although they haven’t achieved the ubiquitous status of digital still cameras, 
digital video cameras have become increasingly common in recent years. 
Likewise, while Linux support for still digital cameras is quite good, its support 
for DV cameras can be called . . . well, let’s just say it’s “progressing.” 
Don’t be discouraged by my tone in that last sentence, though. You 
should have no trouble downloading video from your camera to your com-
puter, editing those video files, and adding effects and even subtitles. To be 
honest, there are still some problems, especially in the area of file format 
conversions, but, as with all things Linux, it will only be a matter of time until 
the wrinkles are ironed out. There are also a couple of cool video editing 
apps that, while not quite ready for prime time, seem promising and are well 
worth keeping an eye on: PiTiVi and Diva.
For the time being, however, the application of choice for the digital 
video camera user is Kino. Kino, shown in Figure 17-6, is an iMovie-like 
application with which you can capture video from your camera and then 
edit it. To install Kino, open Synaptic and perform a Name and Description 
search for kino. In the list of results that appears, mark and then install 
dvdgrab, kino, and kinoplus. Once it’s installed, you can run Kino by going 
to the Applications menu and selecting Sound & Video Kino.
Setting Up Your System to Capture Digital Video
When you want to transfer a digital image from your digital still camera to 
your computer, you basically just download it. When you want to transfer a 
video clip from your DV camera to your computer, however, you have to 
capture the video stream while you play it; probably the easiest way to go 
about doing this is by using Kino. Before you can begin capturing video 
with Kino, however, there are a few steps you must first perform the first 
time around. 

288
Chapter 17
Figure 17-6: Using your digital video camera with Kino 
These are the steps:
1.
Connect your camera to your computer using the FireWire (IEEE 1394) 
cable that came with (or you were forced to buy for) your camera.
2.
Turn on your DV camera in play mode. Once you’ve done this, the 
raw1394 module will appear in your system’s /dev directory (if it hasn’t 
already). 
3.
After a couple of seconds, turn off your camera. You can leave the cable 
connected.
4.
Open a Terminal window, type cd /dev, and press ENTER.
5.
In the same Terminal window, change the permissions of the raw1394 
module, so that everyone on your machine can read and write to it, by 
typing sudo chmod a+rw raw1394 and pressing ENTER.
6.
You will then be prompted for your password, so type it, and press ENTER.
If all goes without a hitch, you will be returned to your user prompt 
without any other messages appearing in the Terminal. 
Capturing and Editing Digital Video with Kino
Once you have gone through the preparatory steps I’ve just mentioned, you 
are ready to capture video from your camera. To do this, connect your camera 
to your computer by FireWire cable (if it isn’t still connected), turn on your 
camera to Play mode, and then start up Kino. Once Kino is open, click the 
Capture tab to the right of the playback pane. 

Couch Penguins
289
To get started capturing video, you can use the playback controls located 
below the playback pane. These control buttons actually control the functions 
of your camera itself. Start out by clicking the rewind button until you get to 
the beginning of the video segment you want to capture. Once you get there, 
click the play button, after which the video on your camera will play back 
within the Kino window. When you reach the point at which you want to start 
capturing, click the Capture button just above the play back controls in the 
Kino window. Kino will then start capturing your video to disk (in your home 
folder by default). To keep things easy to manage, the captured video stream 
will be split into several files, the number of which depends on the length of 
the video played.
You will notice that after you click the Capture button, the video playback 
in the playback pane will stop moving. This being the case, you will need to 
view the action in your camera’s viewer in order to know where you are in the 
capture process. When you get to the point where you’d like to stop capturing, 
click the stop button. You can then view the captured video by clicking the 
Edit button and then using the playback controls at the bottom of the play-
back pane. You can also view the video in Timeline view (as shown in Fig-
ure 17-7) in order to navigate between the various segments of the video; 
click the Timeline tab, click the segment you wish to view, and then use the 
playback controls below the playback pane.

If you feel like getting a bit arty, you can also try out the effects available 
in Kino (some examples of which are shown in Figure 17-8) by clicking the 
FX tab and then playing around with the various effects in the drop-down 
menu below the words Video Filter. Make your choice, specify the segment 
you’d like to convert (or at least experiment with) by typing the beginning 
and ending frame numbers in the boxes below the word Overwrite, and then 
click the Preview button to see the results without saving the changes to 
disk. If you do want to convert the segment so as to keep the effect, click 
the Render button, and Kino will create a new file of just that segment. Those 
files, as well as the original captures, can all be viewed in Totem, which is a 
better application to use for video viewing, by simply double-clicking the files.

Other Video Apps
I’ve covered the main video applications in Ubuntu, but there are still others 
available that you might want to consider. A very popular alternative video/
DVD player, for example, is MPlayer (Figure 17-9), which you can download 
and install by performing a Synaptic search for mplayer. Be sure to download 
not only mplayer itself, but also mplayer-fonts so as to avoid annoying error 
messages. 
Another video/DVD player you might want to consider is gxine, which is 
similar in several ways to Totem, but it gives you a bit more control over things. 
Again, you can download and install gxine via Synaptic by performing a search 
for gxine.

If you are not only a video watcher but also a budding video artist, then 
you might want to consider a handy pair of video/DVD authoring and editing 
tools: QDVD-Author, which is a DVD creator application in the iDVD vein 
(albeit without the superficial polish of Apple’s offering); and DVD::Rip, 
which, as you might imagine, allows you to rip the contents of a DVD to 
your hard disk. These applications are available via Synaptic by performing 
searches for qdvdauthor and dvdrip.

Security
Many a Windows user has entered the 
Linux fold after a host of bad experiences 
with malware in the Windows world—viruses, 
spyware, and all sorts of other malicious bits of 
software code, too numerous to imagine. Windows is 
also plagued by a seemingly endless array of security 
vulnerabilities, leaving the system easy prey to invaders with less than noble 
intentions. Every trip out into cyberspace thus becomes something like a run 
through the infectious diseases ward of a hospital. For a Windows user, it can 
sometimes seem that more time is spent ridding the system of viral pests and 
defending it from invaders than is actually spent getting things done. 
Fortunately, Linux does not suffer greatly from such problems, leading 
to the much-touted claim that Linux is practically virus free and quite secure. 
There are numerous lines of reasoning proffered to explain Linux’s malware- 
and exploit-resistant nature. One reason is simply popularity—or lack thereof. 
As Linux is not as widespread a system as Windows is, it is also a much less 
attractive target of digital evil-doers, who very often seem to be motivated by 
the challenge and headline-catching glory that comes with creating a truly 
global virus or finding a theretofore unknown back door. 

294
Chapter 18
Another reason is that Linux users, as a general rule, work on their 
computers in a non-privilege mode, one in which the user does not have 
the right to install software without a password. This is not the case, at least 
not by default, in Windows. A virus or other form of malware attached to 
an email or piggybacked upon another file or application cannot, therefore, 
install itself in your Linux system without that password . . . well, theoretically, 
at least. Of course, now that Windows uses its own privilege structure, this 
point is a bit less of an issue.
There is also the matter of structural design. Every system out there has 
security holes that can be exploited by digital and human foe alike. Windows 
might well be called the Swiss cheese of operating systems in this regard. Of 
course, Linux has its holes too, though far fewer of them than Windows does; 
and Linux plugs them up through downloadable updates faster, once they 
are found.
Finally, there is the defensive edge that Ubuntu’s pre-configured 
security policy brings—there are no open incoming ports in Ubuntu 
desktop systems. This means that your Ubuntu Linux system is even less 
susceptible to unwanted intrusions.
Does My System Need Protection?
So with all this talk about Linux’s great security, you may wonder whether 
you need to bother worrying about it at all. Well, if you take a look at the 
Ubuntu forums, you might find yourself a bit confused. When asked whether 
Linux users need to install antivirus software or firewalls, most users answer 
with an emphatic no. On the other hand, you’ll find that there are an awful 
lot of people out there who have installed or are trying to install that soft-
ware. Hmmm. 
So what’s a Linux user to do?
If you are on a network where you transfer a lot of files among a lot of 
Windows machines, you might want to think about installing some antivirus 
software, if for nothing more than the good of the Windows systems involved 
and the users of those systems—your unenlightened (i.e., Windows-using) 
email pals, for example. You might also want to give it a go if you are, by 
nature, on the cautious side of the spectrum. Basically, if it makes you feel 
safer to install some protection, go ahead. If it makes you feel safer to go 
whole hog and install the full line of defense mechanisms I cover in this 
chapter, go ahead. After all, either way you go, it isn’t going to cost you 
anything, and it certainly isn’t going to hurt you any.
The First Line of Defense
Regardless of the system you happen to be using (though I am assuming that 
you have become a Linux devotee by now), the first line of defense for any 
computer permanently hooked up to the Internet is a router—an electronic 
device that allows a number of computers on a local network (such as in your 

Defending the Nest
295
home or at your office) to connect to and share a single connection from 
your Internet service provider (ISP). While the router is connected to your 
modem via cable, the connection from the router to the computers on your 
local network can be wired, wireless, or both. 
What has a router got to do with the defense of your computer? Well, 
most routers include a firewall, which essentially functions to keep all of the 
bad stuff out there on the Web away from your computer, much in the way 
that the firewall in your car keeps the heat, fumes, and noise from your engine 
out of the passenger compartment. This built-in firewall is one reason that 
even people with only one computer, who could just as easily connect their 
computer directly to their cable or DSL modem, use a router. Of course, just 
how much security the firewall in your router provides depends on which 
filters you select in the firewall setup software. For example, a very common 
and useful filter (particularly for those with a wireless network) limits Internet 
access to those machines specified on the firewall’s access list. This prevents 
your next-door neighbors from hitching a wireless ride via your ISP connec-
tion. They aren’t paying the bill, after all.
The setup software for a router is built in to the router itself, so you don’t 
have to worry about software installation and system compatibility. Using 
your router with Linux is no different than using it with Windows. You can 
access the software and modify your settings via a simple web browser, as you 
can see in Figure 18-1. Just type the IP address of the router (usually provided 
in the owner’s manual) in the browser’s location bar, press ENTER, and you’ll 
be ready to go. 
Figure 18-1: Setting up a router

296
Chapter 18
Software Firewalls
If you don’t have a router and don’t plan on getting one, or if you have one, 
but you are bordering on paranoia, you might want to consider using a soft-
ware firewall, in particular one of the most popular software firewalls available 
for Linux, Firestarter.
You can download and install Firestarter via Synaptic by doing a search 
for firestarter and then installing it. Once it is installed, run Firestarter by 
going to the Applications menu and selecting Internet Firestarter. You will 
then be prompted for your password, so type that, and click the OK button.
The first time out, Firestarter will open with a pretty self-explanatory 
setup wizard. If the wizard doesn’t seem all that self-explanatory to you, and 
you’re not sure what to do, just accept the default settings by clicking the 
Forward button in each of the wizard screens until you get to the last one 
(shown in Figure 18-2). In that screen, make sure that the box next to Start 
firewall now is checked, click the Save button, and then click Quit. When the 
wizard is finished, the main Firestarter window will appear and, assuming the 
correct network device was detected and selected, the firewall will be up and 
running.
Figure 18-2: The last screen of the Firestarter setup wizard
If the wrong network device was selected, a warning window will appear 
telling you so. In that case, you can do a bit of trial-and-error manipulation 
by clicking the Preferences button in the main Firestarter window and then 
clicking Network Settings in the Preferences window that appears (Fig-
ure 18-3). In that window, select one of the other devices listed in the drop-
down menu next to the words Detected device(s), and then click the Accept
button. Once back at the main Firestarter window, click the Start Firewall
button, and see what happens. If you still can’t start the firewall, repeat the 
process I’ve just described, this time selecting a different network device. 

Defending the Nest
297
Figure 18-3: Selecting network devices in Firestarter
Once your firewall is up and running, there is nothing more that you 
really need to do. You can simply look at the Firestarter window (Figure 18-4) 
to see what is going on network-wise on your computer—what active connec-
tions you have, how much information has been coming and going, and if 
there have been any events in which, for example, the firewall has blocked an 
intruder. If you click the Events tab, you can then see the details of those 
events, such as what connection attempts were blocked, where they came 
from, and when they happened. 
Figure 18-4: Firestarter in action

298
Chapter 18
Taking Control of Firestarter
You can control how Firestarter deals with various network events by creating 
your own policies. The default policy set in Firestarter allows you to basically 
do whatever you normally do via the Internet, while it blocks new connections 
to your computer from the Internet or any other computer on your network. 
To make things a bit more draconian, you can click the Policy tab, select 
Outbound traffic policy in the drop-down menu next to the word Editing,
and then select Restrictive by default, whitelist traffic. If you just want to 
deny anyone working on your computer access to a specific website, for 
instance, simply click the Deny connections to host field to select it, and 
then click the Add Rule button. In the Add New Outbound Rule window, 
enter the URL for the targeted site, click Add, and then click the Apply 
Policy button in the main Firestarter window.
Confirming That Firestarter Runs Automatically
After you run Firestarter the first time, it will set itself to automatically start 
up whenever you start up your system. Don’t be concerned when you don’t 
see the graphical interface you saw when you first started it up; Firestarter 
will be running in the background, silently protecting your computer.
If you are the doubting type, you can check to see whether or not 
Firestarter actually is running in the background by opening a Terminal 
window, typing sudo /etc/init.d/firestarter status, and then pressing ENTER.
If Firestarter is running, you will see the message * Firestarter is running. . .
in the Terminal window. Worries over.
Finding Out More
If the world of firewalls is new to you, you can check out the Firestarter home 
page to learn a bit more. To check out the online manual, just to go to the 
Firestarter Help menu, and select Online Users’ Manual, which will bring up 
the page in your web browser. If you prefer to check out the manual before 
installing Firestarter, point your browser to www.fs-security.com/docs. You 
will also find a pretty good quick tutorial there.
ClamAV: Antivirus Software, Linux Style
Despite the lack of viruses out there that can wreak havoc upon your Linux 
system, your computer could still act as a transmitter of Windows viruses. As a 
result, there are a number of free antivirus scanners out there for Linux users 
interested in helping to protect Windows users from viruses. These include 
Aegis (available via Synaptic), Panda Antivirus (www.pandasoftware.com/
download/linux.htm), f-Prot (www.f-prot.com), and numerous others. For 
most Linux users, however, the virus scanner of choice is the open source 
contender—ClamAV.

Defending the Nest
299
Although it can be used on a number of operating systems, ClamAV is 
considered to be the Linux antivirus software package. It is open source, 
totally free, and you don’t have to worry about licenses or suffer the bother 
of renewing them. Unfortunately, on its own, ClamAV is a command-driven 
application, which makes it a bit less user-friendly. Fortunately for all involved, 
there is also a graphical interface available, albeit a simple one, by the name 
of ClamTk. Both ClamAV and ClamTk are available via Synaptic, so if you want 
to give them a try, just do a search for clamtk, mark it for installation, and then 
install it. Synaptic will download it, ClamAV, and any other packages needed 
to make the whole thing work. 
Using the ClamAV/ClamTk Duo
Once installed, just click the Run Application panel applet, type clamtk in the 
Run Application window, and then click the Run button. This will bring up 
the Clam Tk Virus Scanner window (Figure 18-5). After it appears, you should 
set up ClamAV so that it will automatically quarantine any viruses it finds. To 
do this, go to the Actions menu, and select Quarantine Infected Files. Then 
go to the File menu, select Scan Directory, and, in the left pane of that 
window, double-click the icon for the folder or disk you want to scan. Once 
you’ve done that, click the OK button, and ClamAV will start scanning your 
system. ClamTk will let you know what it (or, rather, ClamAV) is scanning at 
any given moment in the empty space just below the button bar. If it finds 
anything suspicious, it will list that item in the main pane of the window. 
Figure 18-5: ClamTk—the graphical interface for ClamAV
As I mentioned before, the only viruses you are likely to encounter dur-
ing a virus scan are those designed for Windows systems, and because those 
viruses cannot affect your Linux system, focusing your efforts where they are 
likely to do the most good seems a sound way of doing things. Although it 
won’t hurt you any to scan your entire system for viruses, especially if doing 
so makes you feel better, it is probably better to focus your virus scanning 
activities on your Windows partition, if you have one, and on any files that 
you will be sending as email attachments, particularly to Windows users. 

300
Chapter 18
While ClamAV may be the virus scanner of choice in the Linux world, my 
personal favorite is still avast!, which defended me during my Windows years. 
I think it is easier to use and, for what it’s worth, nicer to look at. On the 
downside, it does require you to register every year so that you can get a 
license key, but that is hardly a monumental task, and it is still free—at least 
for home and noncommercial use, which, if my target audience for this book 
was correctly predicted, should include you. If nothing else, it is worth a try, 
so just go for it.
18-1: Downloading the avast! RPM and License Key
First you have to get the avast! 4 file and license key. You can do this by 
opening your web browser and going to www.avast.com/eng/avast-for-linux-
workstation.html. Once there, click the Download icon on the right side of 
the page. On the download page, click the Download button for the RPM 
of the avast! Linux Home Edition, and then download the file to your home 
folder. Once you’ve done that, click the registration form link, and fill out 
and submit that form. You should receive your license key by email a few 
minutes later.
18-2: Converting the avast! RPM to a DEB Package
Once the avast! RPM is safely downloaded to your home folder, you need to 
convert it to an Ubuntu-friendly DEB package using the application Alien, 
which you installed and learned to use in Chapter 9. Assuming you have Alien 
installed, just type sudo alien –d avast*.rpm, and press ENTER.
After that, type your password when prompted to do so, and then just 
wait until you get the message avast4workstation_1.0.4.2_i386.deb generated
(your version number may be different) in the Terminal window. The newly 
generated DEB package will appear in your home folder along with the 
original RPM.
18-3: Installing the avast! DEB Package
Now that you’ve created the avast! DEB package, you can install it using the 
dpkg command, as you did in Chapter 9. Just type sudo dpkg -i avast*.deb,
and press ENTER. When the Terminal displays your usual user prompt, you 
will know that you have successfully installed avast! and are ready to move on.
18-4: Running and Using avast!
Once avast! is installed, you can run it by clicking the Run Application panel 
applet (or pressing ALT-F2), typing avastgui in that window, and then clicking 
the Run button. The first time you run avast!, a small window (Figure 18-6) 
will appear asking you to input your license code. Assuming you registered 
Project 18: Virus Scanning with avast!

Defending the Nest
301
your free copy of avast! at the beginning of the project as I instructed you to 
do, your registration key should already be waiting for you in your emailer’s 
inbox. Go have a look, copy the key, and paste it into the text field in the 
Registration window (you’ll have to use the CTRL-V key combination to do 
this). Once the license key is in place, click the OK button.
Figure 18-6: Entering your avast! 
license key
The main avast! window (Figure 18-7) will now appear, but before you 
get started scanning away, it is a good idea to check if there are any new virus 
watches to be added to your present database. New viruses are constantly 
appearing in cyberspace, and it is thus necessary to keep avast!’s virus data-
base up to date so that it recognizes any viral newcomers. To perform the 
update, just click the Update database button, and let avast! do its thing.
Figure 18-7: avast! virus scanner
When avast! is done updating the virus database, you can get on to the 
work of virus scanning by first deciding whether you want to scan just your 

302
Chapter 18
Home directory, the entire system, or selected folders. You can also decide 
how thorough a scan you wish to perform via the three choices available in 
the middle of the window: Quick, Standard, or Thorough. 
Which one of these sensitivity modes you choose depends on how 
thorough you want the scan to be. The Quick scan just scans files that end in 
certain extensions (.exe, .scr, .com, .doc, etc.), because these are the file 
types that are most often virus carriers. The Standard scan targets more files, 
ignoring extensions, but still limiting the scan to those file types that are 
usually associated with viruses. Finally, the Thorough scan scans everything 
and searches for every type of virus.
Once you have made your selections, click the Start scan button, and 
avast! will start doing exactly that—showing its progress within the same 
window, no less. When the scan is complete, a small window will pop up 
telling you, hopefully, that no viruses were found. When was the last time 
you got a message like that on your Windows machine?

As I mentioned in Chapter 1, the version 
of the Ubuntu Desktop CD that comes with 
this book is designed to work with i386 proc-
essors. It will also work with AMD64 processors, 
albeit not in 64-bit mode. In order to use Ubuntu with 
AMD64 processors in 64-bit mode, or on PowerPC 
machines you must get a different disk on your own. There are several ways 
of doing this: downloading an ISO (disk image) and then burning it to CD 
yourself, ordering the CD (for free) from Ubuntu, or ordering it from an 
online Linux CD provider (for a nominal cost).
Downloading and Burning Ubuntu Desktop CD ISOs to CD
To download an ISO of the Ubuntu Desktop CD, go to the Ubuntu download 
page at www.ubuntu.com/download. On that page, click one of the links for 
the region in which you happen to be. 
On the next page, go to the Desktop CD section at the top of the page, 
and click either 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD or Mac (PowerPC) desktop 
CD, depending on the type of machine you have, on the page that appears. 

304
Appendix A
The download will begin immediately after that. Remember that the ISO 
file you will be downloading is a heavyweight, weighing in at over 600MB, 
so the download will take a bit of time. Don’t count on getting it all down 
and done before dinner . . . or, if you happen to be using a dial-up Internet 
connection, before dinner tomorrow. Yikes!
Burning the ISO to CD in Windows
Once the Desktop CD ISO has been downloaded and checked, you need to 
burn it to CD before you can use it. Although Windows has built-in CD 
writing capabilities, it does not have the ability to burn ISOs. To burn an ISO 
to CD in Windows, therefore, you must use a third-party commercial 
application, such as Nero. If you don’t have a commercial disk-burning 
utility installed on your system, you can instead download the free and 
handy ISO Recorder, which only works with Windows XP, though a beta 
version for the new Windows Vista is also available. 
To get ISO Recorder for Windows XP, Gold or SP1 (Service Pack 1), go 
to http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/v1.htm, and scroll to the Download 
section. Once there, click the link at the end of the sentence ISO Recorder can 
be downloaded here. To get ISO Recorder for Windows XP SP2 (Service Pack 2), 
go to http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/v2.htm, and click the Here is the 
current build link near the top of the page. Once the download is complete, 
double-click the ISORecorderSetup.msi file on your hard disk to install it.
After the installation is complete, you can get down to burning your ISO 
to disk by double-clicking the ubuntu-x.xx-live-amd64.iso file on your disk 
(x.xx represents the version of the ISO you’ve downloaded), and selecting 
Copy image to CD in the popup menu. A CD Recording Wizard window, like 
that in Figure A-1, will then appear. 
Figure A-1: Burning an ISO to CD in Windows using ISO Recorder
It is generally considered best if you burn installation or live CDs at a 
lower speed than the maximum speed allowed by your drive, with 2X to 
4X speeds considered optimal. To do so, click the Recorder Properties
button in the CD Recording Wizard window, and then drag the slider in 

Ubuntu Desktop CDs for AMD64 and PowerPC Users
305
the properties window that appears down to about 4X. After that, pop a 
blank CD into the drive, if you don’t have one there already, and click the 
Next button. The CD burning process will begin. Once it’s done, the CD will 
pop out of the drive, and you’ll have yourself an AMD64-compatible live CD. 
You can then use it by following the same directions found at the beginning 
of Chapter 2 for using the live CD that comes with this book.
NOTE
If your CD does not seem to work, there could be a problem with the ISO file you down-
loaded. You can check this out by doing an integrity check as explained in Appendix B. 
Instructions for both Mac and Windows systems are provided.
Burning the ISO to CD in OS X
To burn an ISO file to CD in OS X, first check to make sure the ISO image is 
not mounted by opening a Finder window and checking the disk area at the 
top of the left pane. If it is mounted, a white drive icon will appear in that 
location. If the drive icon is there, click the arrow next to that entry to eject, 
or unmount, it.
After that, click Applications in the same Finder window, and then look 
for and open the Utilities folder. In that folder, find and then double-click 
Disk Utility. If the ISO is not listed in the left pane of the Disk Utility window 
when it opens, go back to the Finder window, locate the Ubuntu Live CD ISO 
you just downloaded, and then drag it to the left pane of the Disk Utility 
window, just below the listings for your current drives. Once the ISO file 
appears in that list, click it once to highlight it. Your Disk Utility window 
should then look something like that in Figure A-2. 
Figure A-2: Burning the Ubuntu Desktop CD ISO to CD in Mac OS X

306
Appendix A
To complete the process, click the Burn icon in the Disk Utility toolbar, 
and then insert a blank CD in your drive when prompted to do so in the 
window that appears. Once the blank disk is inserted and recognized, you 
will be able to adjust the burn speed by clicking the drop-down menu button 
next to the word Speed. Select as low a speed as your hardware will allow, which, 
depending on the age of your Mac, will probably be 4X to 8X. Once you’ve 
done that, click the Burn button in that same window, after which the 
burning process will begin. 
Getting an Install Disk from Ubuntu
The easiest and most foolproof way of getting an Ubuntu Desktop CD is by 
simply ordering one (or more) for free from Ubuntu—you don’t even have 
to pay shipping or handling. They will not only send you one install CD for 
your particular machine architecture, but they will actually send you one for 
each of the architectures they support: i386, AMD64, and PowerPC. In fact, 
you don’t even get a choice of which you want—it’s basically an all-or-nothing 
deal, which in this case isn’t such a bad thing. Of course, the only downside 
of this approach is time. It can take four to six weeks for you to get the CDs in 
this manner, so if you are the impatient type, you might want to opt for one 
of the other methods.
To order your install CDs from Ubuntu, go to https://shipit.ubuntu.com, 
click the create a new account link, fill out the simple registration form (you 
don’t have to enter any sensitive information, basically just your name and 
address), and then select the number of CDs you want. It’s all very easy.
Ordering an Install Disk from Other Online Sources
If you are in a hurry to get your install CD, you can also order a copy from 
one of the many online sources that specialize in copying and selling install 
CDs for a variety of Linux distributions at very low prices. For example, you 
can get an Ubuntu install CD from LinuxCD (www.linuxcd.org) for a penny 
shy of two dollars. CheapBytes (www.cheapbytes.com) and UseLinux (www 
.uselinux.net) are two other well-known sources you might want to try.
Mac Users: Booting Your Mac from the Ubuntu Desktop CD
Most Mac users are probably aware of this already, but I thought I’d better 
explain how to boot your machine from the Ubuntu Desktop CD just in case. 
Insert the CD in your drive, restart the machine, and then after the machine 
shuts down and before it begins starting up again, press and hold the C key. 
Once Ubuntu starts booting, you can release the key and follow the onscreen 
directions. From then on out, the procedures are the same as those for the 
i386 version mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 2. If you have any 
problems, check out the Ubuntu forums at www.ubuntuforums.org.

When you download ISOs, or disk images, 
via the Internet, it is always a good idea to 
check the integrity of the download to make 
sure that all is as it should be. The cautious do 
this before burning the image to disk. The more impa-
tient or reckless, such as myself, do it only after burning 
an image to disk and finding out it doesn’t work. Since blank CDs are cheap 
these days, this latter approach really doesn’t cost you much more than a 
bit of time, so the choice is strictly up to you. If you do find yourself wanting 
or needing to check the integrity of the ISOs you’ve downloaded, I will provide 
you with the details for doing so in Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.
Checking the Integrity of an ISO File in Windows
To check the integrity of an ISO in Windows, you need a tiny little DOS pro-
gram called md5sum, which is also common in the Linux world. This program 
is not included with Windows, so you’ll have to get it and install it yourself. 

308
Appendix B
Fortunately, this is very easy to do. Just go to www.etree.org/md5com.html, 
and click the md5sum.exe link in the top half of the page, after which the 
md5sum.exe file will soon appear on your hard disk. Once it’s there, here 
are the steps you need to follow in order to check your ISO:
1.
Drag the md5sum.exe file to C:\Windows\system32 if you’re running 
Windows XP; C:\winnt\system32 if you’re running Windows 2000; or 
C:\windows\command if you’re running Windows 95, 98, or the absolutely 
dreadful Windows Me.
2.
Go to the site from which you downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop CD 
ISO (www.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06), and scroll down to the bottom 
of the page, where you will find a list of files in link form. Right-click 
the MD5SUMS link near the top of the list. In the popup menu that 
appears, select Save link as in order to save the file. Once you’re done, 
you should have an MD5SUMS file on your hard disk.

Place the MD5SUMS file in the same directory as the Ubuntu Desktop or 
Install CD ISO, making sure there are no other MD5SUMS files in that 
directory. To make it easier to follow along with my directions, create a 
folder named ISO on your desktop, and place both the MD5SUMS file 
and the ISO in that folder.
4.
Open the Command Prompt by going to the Start menu and selecting 
All Programs Accessories Command Prompt.
5.
In the Command Prompt window, type cd Desktop\ISO. After you’ve done 
that, press ENTER. Your command prompt should then read something 
to the effect of C:\Documents and Settings\rg\cd Desktop\ISO, though 
your username will no doubt be different than my rg.
6.
In the Command Prompt window, now type md5sum –c MD5SUMS, and then 
press ENTER. As the MD5SUMS file contains checksums for all Ubuntu 
ISOs, you will almost immediately be greeted by a list of ISO files followed 
by the word FAILED. You will notice, however, that your command prompt 
has not yet returned, meaning that your system is still busy reading what 
is indeed there. When the checking is all done, your command prompt 
will return, and the entry for the disk ISO you’ve downloaded, such as 
desktop-amd64.iso, should be followed by an OK, as in Figure B-1. If so, 
then you are ready to burn. If not, you’ll need to download the file again, 
this time from a different mirror perhaps. Oh, and don’t worry about the 
9 out of 10 listed files could not be read warning near the bottom of the 
Command Prompt window; you only had one ISO file in the ISO folder, 
so that explains that.

Checking the Integrity of Downloaded ISOs

Figure B-1: Viewing the results of an ISO integrity check in Windows
Checking the Integrity of an ISO File in Mac OS X
Checking the integrity of an ISO in Mac OS X is a bit different from what 
I’ve described for Windows, in that OS X does not include md5sum, and 
there isn’t a similar utility that is easy to install. Thus, you will have to go 
about things in a slightly different, and decidedly un-Maclike, manner. 
Here are the steps:
1.
Go to the site from which you downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop ISO, 
and scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you will find a list of 
filenames in link form. Click the MD5SUMS link near the top of the list, 
after which a new page filled with seemingly meaningless text will open. 
Keep this window open, as you’ll need the information on that last line 
(Figure B-2) in a short while.
Figure B-2: Viewing the checksum for the Ubuntu Desktop CD 
for Mac
2.
Determine the path to your ISO file by right-clicking the file and select-
ing Get Info. The path to your ISO file will be listed next to the word 
Where in the Get Info window. 

310
Appendix B
3.
Now comes the un-Maclike bit. Open a Finder window, click Applications
in the left panel, and then scroll down and open the Utilities folder. 
Once in that folder, find and then double-click Terminal, after which 
the Terminal application will appear. 
4.
In the Terminal window type openssl md5, plus the path to the ISO file 
that you found in the Get Info window in step 2, plus the name of the file 
itself. When you’re done, it should all look something like this, although 
your username (mine is rg) and ISO path might be different:
openssl md5 /Users/rg/Desktop/Ubuntu-6.06-desktop-powerpc.iso
5.
Assuming everything looks as it should, press ENTER.
6.
The openssl md5 program will then scan the file, which might take a 
little while, and then it will produce an odd string of numbers, such as 
that shown in Figure B-3. Compare that string of numbers with those you 
found on the Ubuntu download site in step 1, and if they match, your ISO 
is fine and ready for burning. If not, you’ve got a stinker on your hands 
and will have to download the file again, perhaps from a different down-
load mirror.
Figure B-3: Viewing the results of the ISO integrity check in OS X
Checking the Integrity of an ISO File in Linux
As a new Ubuntu user, you may not be at the stage where you find yourself 
downloading ISOs, but that time will no doubt come. For that reason, I am 
also including instructions on how to check the integrity of an ISO via Linux. 
Fortunately, the process is quite simple—similar in fact to that mentioned in 
the Windows section on page 307, though the md5sum application is already 
included with Ubuntu, so things are even easier. Here’s all you need to do:
1.
Go to the site from which you downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop CD 
ISO, and scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you will find a 
list of files in link form. Right-click the MD5SUMS link near the top of 
the list. In the popup menu that appears, select Save Link As in order 
to save the file. Once you’re done, you should have an MD5SUMS file 
on your hard disk.

Checking the Integrity of Downloaded ISOs
311
2.
Place the MD5SUMS file in the same directory as the downloaded ISO, 
making sure there are no other MD5SUMS files in that directory. To 
make it easier to follow along with my directions, create an ISO folder 
on your desktop, and place both the MD5SUMS file and the ISO in that 
folder.
3.
Open a Terminal window (Applications Accessories Terminal), type 
cd Desktop/ISO, and press ENTER.
4.
In the Terminal window, now type md5sum –c MD5SUMS, and then press 
ENTER. As the MD5SUMS file contains checksums for all Ubuntu ISOs, 
you will almost immediately be greeted by a list of ISO files followed by 
the word FAILED. You will notice, however, that your command prompt 
has not yet returned, meaning that your system is still busy reading what 
is indeed there. When the checking is all done, your command prompt 
will return, and the entry for the disk ISO you’ve downloaded should be 
followed by an OK, as in Figure B-4. If so, then you are ready to burn. If 
not, you’ll need to download the file again, this time from a different 
mirror perhaps.

R E S O U R C E S
As Linux owes much of its growth and 
development to the Internet, it should 
come as no surprise that there is a wealth of 
information available to you online. In addition 
to the usual news, how-to, and download sites, you will 
also find a variety of tutorials, forums, blogs, and other 
sources of useful information—all of which you can 
turn to as you use and learn more about your system.
Forums
When you are looking for advice, trying to solve a particular problem, or 
just looking for some general tips, online forums are the way to go. Fortu-
nately, Ubuntu has a forum all its own, and since Ubuntu is primarily a 
desktop-oriented Linux distro, you are likely to find many fellow newbies 
and newbie-friendly posters there, rather than the hard-core geekiness you 
might find on some other sites. There are, of course, other newbie-friendly 

314
Appendix C
forums, which, although not Ubuntu-specific, should also be able to provide 
you with lots of helpful information.
Regardless of which forum you are posting in, just be sure to mention 
that you are using Ubuntu, which version you have (Dapper Drake, in case 
you forgot), and that you are new to Linux. And remember to always seek 
clarification when you get an answer you don’t understand. The same poster 
will usually come back and clarify things for you. You should feel right at 
home at most of these sites.

Magazines
If you are more of a tactile type who enjoys the feel of paper pressed between 
your fingers, then you might like to turn to some of the Linux magazines 
available at most major newsstands. (TUX comes in PDF form only, so you’ll 
have to get that one online.) 
As you will notice, there are two unrelated magazines sharing the same 
name: Linux Magazine. One of these is from the United States, one from 
Europe. The newbie who wants some pizzazz in his or her reading materials, 
useful tips, and some things to play around with should go for the Euro 
version. The US version is targeted toward business users and power geeks, 
not newbies.

Books
Once you’ve finished working through this book, you should be able to do 
just about whatever you want in Ubuntu. Still, your interest may have been 
piqued enough that you would like to get deeper into things and find out a 
bit more about Linux. Here are some books that might help in that quest.

Ubuntu CDs
If you would like to order PowerPC or AMD64 versions of the Ubuntu 
Desktop CD, get a replacement for the i386 version that comes with this 
book, or get the next version of Ubuntu when it comes out (if you don’t want 
to or can’t download it), you can place an order with any of the following sites. 
Remember that those from Ubuntu will be free, while those from other 
suppliers will cost you a little ($5 to $12) but will be delivered much faster.
