Introduction
This book provides a broad review of the field of network security, background on related
elements,
and
enough
detail
to
facilitate
understanding
of
the
topics.
It
covers
the
terminology of the field and also provides a guide for hands-on lab education in network
security topics.
Approach
To present a textbook that is both current and pedagogically useful, the material has been organized
to introduce concepts in a logical sequence and provide learning support elements in each chapter.
These include:
Chapter Scenarios Each chapter opens with a short story that follows activities at a fictional com-
pany as it encounters some of the issues of network security.
Hands-On Learning At the end of each chapter, students will find a Chapter Summary and
Review Questions as well as Hands-On Projects, which allow them to examine the information
security arena outside the classroom. Using these projects, students can research, analyze, and
write about various topics so as to reinforce learning objectives and deepen their understanding
of the text.

Features:
As a new edition, this text contains the best of the previous texts (Guide to Firewalls and Network
Security, 2nd ed., and Web Security) along with a new approach and structure more conducive to
the instruction of network and Web security. Specifically, this edition includes:
●
Enhanced Sections on Information, Network, and Web Security—A large portion of Guide to
Firewalls and Network Security is dedicated to firewall operations, with a simplified foundation
in information and network security. This edition further expands on network theory content,
which allows it to be used as a stand-alone text or as a follow-on text to a detailed Introduction
to Information Security course that uses a text like Principles of Information Security.
●
Reorganized Chapter on Security Policy and Standards—This version streamlines the coverage
of policy as a guide for the use of security technologies; it also revises the discussion of
modern security standards by reducing the number being discussed and focusing on those
having the most impact on the topic of network security.
●
Improved and Streamlined Section on Network and Web Security Technologies—This text
seeks to provide coverage of firewall material in a coherent approach that provides an overall
flow while appropriately integrating VPN and encryption discussions without missing
coverage of relevant content.
●
Incorporated Overlapping Material—The two precursor texts from which this book is drawn,
Guide to Firewalls and Network Security and Web Security, have several chapters in common.
By combining the best of each, this text, with enhanced coverage of network security issues,
encryption, intrusion detection, standards, and assessment (testing), offers students a compre-
hensive approach without the redundancy coming from the use of multiple texts in a single
course.
Other Improvements Include:
●
New chapter on the role of the network security professional
●
Enhanced chapter on contingency planning (incident response, disaster recovery, and business
continuity)
●
Increased material on data communications and networking as the foundation of network
security
●
New material on wireless security and enhanced integration of Web security
●
Organization of material to allow hands-on application in a network security lab environment

Structure
Guide to Network Security is a developmental extension of two previous texts: Whitman and
Mattord’s Guide to Firewalls and Network Security: With Intrusion Detection and VPNs, 2nd
edition, and Mackey’s Web Security for Network and Systems Administrators. This textbook is
organized into 12 chapters:
Chapter 1: Introduction to Information Security This chapter provides a primer on information
security and an understanding of the terminology used throughout the text and the discipline. This
chapter also presents the threats and attacks a technology user can expect to encounter while
dealing with network security and firewalls. The chapter concludes with an examination of the
need for a policy-driven approach coupled with an understanding of modern security standards
organizations like ISO, NIST, and the IETF.
Chapter 2: Introduction to Networking This chapter, on the foundations of data communica-
tions and network security, begins with an introduction to modern networking fundamentals
and exposure to the security issues associated with modern data communications technologies.
The chapter examines network architectures, media, and technologies. It also examines the
standards and protocols associated with data communications and networking, focusing on the
two most relevant structures: the OSI reference model and TCP/IP. Using a layer-by-layer
approach, the chapter moves through the structure of the OSI reference model, examining the
security components of each stage.
Chapter 3: Cryptography This chapter serves as a primer on encryption systems by looking at
the history of encryption and the basic principles of cryptography. It surveys popular crypto-
graphic tools and the major protocols used for security communications. Finally, various
attacks on cryptosystems are explored.
Chapter 4: Firewall Technologies and Administration This chapter explains how firewalls work,
outlines the categories of firewalls, and explains how firewalls are used in an organization. It also
examines rule sets used to configure firewalls, with an expansion of the study of firewall
configuration.
Chapter 5: Network Authentication and Remote Access Using VPN This chapter examines authen-
tication, authorization, and auditing; modern access control approaches and methodologies; and
security issues associated with administering access controls. Specifically, the chapter examines how
VPNs support network access control and security issues in deploying VPNs.
Chapter 6: Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems This chapter
begins an overview of network traffic and explains the anatomy of a network packet. It then transi-
tions from network monitoring to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), focusing

on their classifications, use, and deployment. Specific issues associated with IDPS are addressed,
including product selection, deployment, and response strategies.
Chapter 7: Wireless Network Security This chapter continues the coverage of encryption-based net-
work security technologies by examining in detail the implementation, configuration, and use of
wireless protection mechanisms. The chapter also examines methods to secure wireless technologies
and contemporary security issues associated with those technologies.
Chapter 8: Security of Web Applications This chapter examines the broad topics associated with
Internet and Web communication, including specific protocols, programming languages, and other
technologies. Critical attacks associated with Web servers are presented, along with recommenda-
tions on how best to address security vulnerabilities in these systems.
Chapter 9: Network Vulnerability Assessment This chapter discusses the standards, methods,
tools, and techniques employed by network security professionals to evaluate the security of
network security equipment, data servers, and other modern information systems. The chapter
also provides an overview of the common vulnerability assessment methods. An emphasis on
their use in remediating problems completes the chapter.
Chapter 10: Auditing, Monitoring, and Logging This chapter discusses system auditing and how
systems record activities within the system. Data analysis of logs is then examined in the context of
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and its overall tie-in to monitoring security
within IT environments. This chapter also examines formal audit programs and how they relate to
network security.
Chapter 11: Contingency Planning and Network Incident Response This chapter begins by review-
ing the need for business contingency plans and the steps involved in developing, implementing,
and testing those plans. It then discusses the role and responsibilities of the network security
professional in incident response, which include planning, reacting, responding, and recovery
operations.
Chapter 12: Digital Forensics This chapter examines the functions, tasks, and responsibilities of con-
ducting digital forensics. The impact of legal and regulatory requirements on the forensics process is
also reviewed. How to conduct and administer a digital forensics process is discussed in the context
of an organization’s decision to remediate the event and/or pursue prosecution.

Coping with Change on the Web Sooner or later, all the specific Web-based resources men-
tioned throughout the rest of this book will go stale or be replaced by newer information. In some
cases, the URLs you find here may lead you to their replacements; in other cases, the URLs will lead
nowhere, leaving you with the dreaded 404 error message: “File not found.”
When that happens, please don’t give up! There’s always a way to find what you want on the Web, if you’re
willing to invest some time and energy. To begin with, most large or complex Web sites offer a search
engine. As long as you can get to the site itself, you can use this tool to help you find what you need.
Don’t be afraid to use general search tools like www.google.com, www.bing.com, or some other
search engine to find related information. Although certain standards bodies may offer the most
precise and specific information about their standards online, there are plenty of third-party sources
of information, training, and assistance in this area as well. The bottom line is: If you can’t find
something where the book says it lives, start looking around. It’s got to be around there somewhere!

Introduction
Network security is a critical component in the day-to-day IT operations of nearly every
organization in business today. Before learning how to plan, design, and implement network
security, it is important to understand the larger topic of information security and how the
components of network security fit into this topic. Additionally, the field of information
Noah Atwater and Paige Davis have been working in the IT field for almost five
years. They are members of the information technology (IT) staff at Elway Business
Services, Inc.—a company that provides accounting and financial services to small
businesses—and are responsible for the company’s modest IT environment. Noah is
responsible for the Windows servers, and Paige takes care of the Linux servers and
network devices. Both are talented administrators and motivated workers.
In recent years, EBS has been moving more and more of its management and
accounting services to the Web in order to attract more small businesses. A key
aspect of this strategy has been enabling credit card transactions via the EBS Web
site, which allows the company to provide quick service to its customers. However,
the credit card companies, through the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Stan-
dards Council, require EBS and its card processing company to adhere to guidelines
outlined in the council’s Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
Noah and Paige have just met with EBS’s chief information officer, Jeff Mobley. In
order to meet the PCI-DSS requirements, Jeff is hiring a chief information security
officer (CISO) to build the overall security program. Additionally, Jeff has asked that
Noah and Paige immediately start designing the various network security program
components necessary to meet PCI-DSS requirements. There’s no time to wait for the
new CISO.
When Noah and Paige left the meeting, they exchanged worried glances.
Although they are EBS’s most senior IT staff members, they have not spent much
time worrying about an overall security program. With the constant technological
demands of EBS’s customers and staff, the IT department has barely kept the com-
pany’s desktops, servers, networks, and applications running smoothly. The IT staff
has had no governing program for building and reviewing security policies, identi-
fying vulnerabilities, implementing controls, monitoring the day-to-day security,
and responding to any suspicious activities. Noah and Paige have their work cut
out for them.

security has matured in the last 20 years and become so large that those who don’t under-
stand these concepts risk being unable to make the best business decisions regarding net-
work security. This chapter offers an overview of the entire field of information security
and its effects on network security.
What Is Information Security?
Information security (InfoSec) is the protection of information and its critical elements,
including the systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit that information. Infor-
mation security includes the broad areas of information security management, computer
and data security, and network security (the primary topic of this book). To protect infor-
mation and its related systems, organizations must integrate the following security layers:
●
Network security—The protection of networking components, connections, and
contents, which is the primary focus of this textbook
●
Physical security—The protection of the physical items or areas of an organization
from unauthorized access and misuse
●
Personal security—The protection of the people who are authorized to access the
organization and its operations
●
Operations security—The protection of the details of a particular operation or series
of activities
●
Communications security—The protection of an organization’s communications
media, technology, and content
Information Security Terminology
This book uses a number of terms and concepts that are essential to any discussion of infor-
mation security. Several of these terms are illustrated in Figure 1-1.
●
Access—A subject or object’s ability to use, manipulate, modify, or affect another
subject or object. Authorized users have legal access to a system. Access controls
regulate this access.
●
Asset—The organizational resource that is being protected. An asset can be “logical,”
such as a Web site, information, or data, or it can be “physical,” such as a person,
computer system, or other tangible object. Assets, and particularly information assets,
are the focus of security efforts; they are what those efforts are attempting to protect.
●
Attack—An intentional or unintentional act that can cause damage to or otherwise
compromise the information and/or the systems that support it. Attacks can be active
or passive, intentional or unintentional, and direct or indirect. Someone casually reading
sensitive information not intended for his or her use is a passive attack. A hacker
attempting to break into an information system is an intentional attack. A lightning
strike that causes a fire in a building is an unintentional attack. A direct attack is a
hacker using a personal computer to break into a system. An indirect attack is a
hacker compromising a system and using it to attack other systems—for example,
as part of a botnet (slang for robot network). This group of compromised compu-
ters, running software of the attacker’s choosing, can operate autonomously or
under the attacker’s direct control to attack systems and steal user information or

to conduct distributed denial-of-service attacks. Direct attacks originate from the
threat itself. Indirect attacks originate from a compromised system or resource that
is malfunctioning or working under the control of a threat.
●
Control, safeguard, or countermeasure—Security mechanisms, policies, or procedures
that can successfully counterattack, reduce risk, resolve vulnerabilities, and otherwise
improve the security within an organization. The various levels and types of controls
are discussed more fully in the following chapters.
●
Exploit—A technique used to compromise a system. This term can be a verb or a
noun. Threat agents may attempt to exploit a system or other information asset
by using it illegally for their personal gain. Alternatively, an exploit can be a
documented process used to take advantage of a vulnerability or exposure,
usually in software, that is either inherent in the software or created by the
attacker. Exploits make use of existing software tools or custom-made software
components.
●
Exposure—A condition or state of being exposed. In information security, exposure
exists when a vulnerability known to an attacker is present.
Attack: Ima Hacker downloads an 
exploit from MadHackz Web site and 
then accesses buybay’s Web site. 
Ima then applies the script which 
runs and compromises buybay's 
security controls and steals customer 
data. These actions cause buybay to
experience a loss resulting in a loss, 
which is a download of customer data.

●
Intellectual Property—Often referred to as IP, intellectual property is defined as works
of the mind, such as inventions, literature, art, logos, names, symbols, and other crea-
tive works. IP is protected by law, and any use, whether or not it requires payments
or permission, should be properly credited.
●
Loss—A single instance of an information asset suffering damage, unintended or
unauthorized modification, or disclosure. When an organization’s information is
stolen, it has suffered a loss.
●
Protection profile or security posture—The entire set of controls and safeguards
(including policy, education, training and awareness, and technology) that the
organization implements (or fails to implement) to protect the asset. The term
“security program” also gets used for this, but it often includes managerial
aspects of security, including planning, personnel, and subordinate programs.
●
Risk—The probability that something unwanted will happen. Organizations must
minimize risk to match their risk appetite—the quantity and nature of risk the
organization is willing to accept.
●
Subjects and objects—A computer can be either the subject of an attack—an agent
entity used to conduct the attack—or the object of an attack—the target entity, as
shown in Figure 1-2. A computer can be both the subject and object of an attack
when, for example, it is compromised by an attack (object) and is then used to
attack other systems (subject).
●
Threat—A category of objects, persons, or other entities that presents a danger to an
asset. Threats are always present and can be purposeful or undirected. For example,
hackers purposefully threaten unprotected information systems, whereas severe storms
incidentally threaten buildings and their contents.
●
Threat agent—The specific instance of a threat or a particular component of a threat.
For example, all hackers in the world present a collective threat, and Kevin Mitnick,
who was convicted for hacking into phone systems, is a specific threat agent.
Likewise, a lightning strike, hailstorm, or tornado is a threat agent that is part of the
threat of severe storms.
●
Vulnerability—Weaknesses or faults in a system or protection mechanism that open it
to the possibility of attack or damage. Examples of vulnerabilities include a flaw in a

software package, an unprotected system port, and an unlocked door. Well-known
vulnerabilities are those that have been examined, documented, and published;
others remain latent (or undiscovered).
Critical Characteristics of Information
The value of information comes from the characteristics it possesses. When a character-
istic of information changes, the value of that information either increases or, more com-
monly, decreases. Although information security professionals and end users share an
understanding of the characteristics of information, tensions can arise when the need to
secure information from threats conflicts with the end users’ need for unhindered access
to the information. The following are important terms describing the characteristics of
information:
●
Availability enables authorized users—persons or computer systems—to access
information without interference or obstruction, and to receive it in the required
format.
●
Accuracy means that information is free from mistakes or errors and has the value
that the end user expects it to have.
●
Authenticity is the quality or state of being genuine or original rather than a
reproduction or fabrication. Information is authentic when it is the information
that was originally created, placed, stored, or transferred.
●
Confidentiality is the protection of information from disclosure or exposure to
unauthorized individuals or systems. This means that only those with the rights and
privileges to access information are able to do so. To protect any breach in the
confidentiality of information, a number of measures can be used:
●
Information classification
●
Secure document storage
●
Application of general security policies
●
Education of information custodians and end users
●
Data owners are those responsible for the security and use of a particular set of
information. They are usually members of senior management and could be CIOs.
The data owners usually determine the level of data classification associated with the
data. The data owners work with subordinate managers to oversee the day-to-day
administration of the data.
●
Data custodians work directly with data owners and are responsible for the storage,
maintenance, and protection of the information. Depending on the size of the orga-
nization, the custodian may be a dedicated position, such as the CISO, or it may be
an additional responsibility of a systems administrator or other technology manager.
The duties of a data custodian often include overseeing data storage and backups,
implementing the specific procedures and policies laid out in the security policies
and plans, and reporting to the data owner.

●
Data users are end users who work with the information to perform their daily jobs
supporting the mission of the organization, and who therefore share the responsibility
for data security.
●
Integrity means that information remains whole, complete, and uncorrupted. The
integrity of information is threatened when the information is exposed to corruption,
damage, destruction, or other disruption of its authentic state.
●
Utility is the quality or state of having value for some purpose or end. To have utility,
information must be in a format meaningful to the end user. For example, U.S.
Census data can be overwhelming and difficult to understand; however, the data,
when properly interpreted, reveals information about the voters in a district; which
political parties they belong to; their race, gender, and age; and so on.
●
Possession is the ownership or control of some object or item. Information is said
to be in one’s possession if one obtains it, independent of format or other
characteristics.
●
Privacy means that information is used in accordance with the legal requirements
mandated for employees, partners, and customers. In the rush to protect data
from theft or mischief, organizations often trample the rights of individuals. For
example, customers may not want a company to use their names and personal
information for marketing purposes. A comprehensive security strategy should take
into account these privacy concerns.
Security Models
An information security model allows professionals to map abstract security goals to concrete
ideas and blueprints for how to implement proper security controls. Current information
security models evolved from a concept known as the C.I.A. triad, which was developed by
the computer security industry. It is typically displayed as a triangle, as shown in Figure 1-3.
The C.I.A. triad has been the industry standard for computer security since the development
of the mainframe. It is based on three characteristics of information that form the foundation
for many security programs: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
These three characteristics are still important today, but the C.I.A. triad no longer ade-
quately represents all the key security concepts that are used to address the constantly

changing environment of the computer industry. Today’s evolving threats—accidental or
intentional damage or destruction, theft, unintended or unauthorized modification, and
other misapplication—have prompted the development of a more robust security model
that addresses the complexities of the current information security environment.
The definition of information security presented earlier in this chapter is based in part on a
document called the U.S. National Training Standard for Information Security Professionals
NSTISSI No. 4011, which was published by the U.S. Committee on National Security Sys-
tems (CNSS).1 This document presents a comprehensive model for information security,
known as the McCumber Cube, which is becoming a standard for the discussion of secu-
rity of information systems.
Created by John McCumber in 1991, the McCumber Cube provides a graphical descrip-
tion of the architectural approach widely used in computer and information security.2 As
shown in Figure 1-4, it is a representation of a 3 x 3 x 3 cube, with the 27 cells represent-
ing areas that must be addressed to secure today’s information systems. For example, the
intersection between the technology, integrity, and storage areas requires a control or safe-
guard that addresses the need to use technology to protect the integrity of information
while it is in storage. One such control is a system for detecting host intrusion, which pro-
tects the integrity of information by alerting the security administrators to the potential
modification of a critical file.
Balancing Information Security and Access
Information security must effectively balance protection and availability. Even with the best
planning and implementation, it is impossible to obtain perfect information security; informa-
tion security is a process, not a goal. A completely secure information system—if one existed—
would not allow anyone access, ever, resulting in a complete lack of availability. On the other
hand, it is possible to permit unrestricted access to a system, so that it is available to anyone,
anywhere, anytime, through any means. However, this poses a danger to the confidentiality
and integrity of the information.

To achieve balance—that is, to operate an information system to the satisfaction of the user
and the security professional—the level of security must allow reasonable access, yet protect
against threats. An imbalance between access and security can occur when the needs of
the end user are undermined by too heavy a focus on protecting and administering the infor-
mation systems. Both information security technologists and end users must exercise
patience and cooperation when interacting with one another, as both groups share the
same overall goals of the organization: to ensure that the data is available when, where,
and how it is needed, with minimal delays or obstacles. In an ideal world, this level of avail-
ability is met even after concerns about loss, damage, interception, or destruction have been
addressed.
Business Needs First
An information security program performs four important organizational functions:
●
Protects the organization’s ability to function
●
Enables the safe operation of applications implemented on the organization’s
IT systems
●
Protects the data the organization collects and uses
●
Safeguards the technology assets in use at the organization
Protecting the Functionality of an Organization Both general management
and IT management are responsible for implementing information security that protects the
organization’s ability to function. Although many business and government managers shy
away from addressing information security because they perceive it to be a technically com-
plex task, implementing information security actually has more to do with management than
with technology. Just as managing payroll has more to do with management than with
mathematical wage computations, managing information security to protect an organiza-
tion’s ability to function has more to do with policy and enforcement than with the technology
of its implementation.
Enabling the Safe Operation of Applications Because the majority of a busi-
ness’s critical data resides in complex IT applications, today’s organizations are under
immense pressure to acquire and operate integrated, efficient, and capable applications. Secur-
ing the storage of business-critical data, ensuring the integrity of key business transactions,
and making communication constantly available require protecting these applications, particu-
larly those that are important elements of the organization’s infrastructure—operating system
platforms, electronic mail (e-mail), and instant messaging (IM) applications.
Protecting Data that Organizations Collect and Use Any business, educa-
tional institution, or government agency that functions within the modern context of con-
nected and responsive services relies on information systems to support its transactions.
Even if the transaction is not online, information systems and the data they process enable
the creation and movement of goods and services. Therefore, protecting data in motion
and data at rest are both critical aspects of information security. The value of data motivates
attackers to steal, sabotage, or corrupt it. An effective information security program

directed by management is essential to the protection of the integrity and value of the
organization’s data.
Safeguarding Technology Assets in Organizations To perform effectively,
organizations must add secure infrastructure services matching the size and scope of the
enterprise assets. In general, as the organization’s network grows to accommodate chang-
ing needs, it may need more robust technology solutions. An example of a robust solution
is a firewall, a device that keeps certain kinds of network traffic out of the internal net-
work. Another example is caching network appliances, which are devices that store local
copies of Internet content, such as Web pages that are frequently referred to by employees.
In order to ensure effective business operations, these key technology assets must also be
protected.
Threats to Information Security
Around 500 BC, the Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote a treatise on warfare called the Art of
War. It contains military strategies that are still studied by military leaders and students.
In one of his most famous passages, Sun Wu writes, “If you know the enemy and know
yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not
the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the
enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”3 In the battle to protect information,
you must know yourself—that is, be familiar with the information that needs protecting and
the systems that store, transport, and process it. You must also know the enemy—that is, be
informed about the various threats facing the organization, its people, applications, data,
and information systems.
To understand the wide range of threats that pervade the interconnected world, research-
ers have interviewed practicing information security personnel and examined the informa-
tion security literature on threats. Although the categorizations may vary, threats are relatively
well researched and, consequently, fairly well understood.
The Computer Security Institute (CSI) Computer Crime and Security Survey is a represen-
tative study. The study found that approximately 50 percent of the organizations respond-
ing (skewed to primarily larger organizations) had experienced at least one security incident,
with 45.6 percent of those respondents reporting that they had been the subject of a tar-
geted attack.4
Table 1-1 presents 12 categories that are a clear and present danger to an organization’s
people, information, and systems, listed in order from most severe to least severe, as deter-
mined by the study’s participants. Each organization must prioritize the dangers it faces,
based on the particular security situation in which it operates, its organizational strategy
regarding risk, and the exposure levels in which its assets operate. You’ll notice that
many of the threat examples could be listed in more than one category. For example, an
act of theft performed by a hacker falls into the theft category, but such acts are often accom-
panied by defacement actions to delay discovery, thus they may also be placed within the
sabotage-or-vandalism category.

Attacks on Information Security
An attack is an action that takes advantage of a vulnerability to compromise a controlled
system. As described earlier, a threat is accomplished by a threat agent that damages or steals
an organization’s information or physical asset. Unlike threats, which are always present,
attacks occur through specific actions that may cause a business loss. For example, the
threat of damage from a thunderstorm is present during most of the summer in many
places, but a thunderstorm attack and its associated risk of loss only exist for the duration
of the actual thunderstorm. The following sections discuss each of the major types of
attack used against controlled systems.
Malicious Code
Malicious code attacks, mentioned earlier, include the execution of viruses, worms, Tro-
jan horses, and active Web scripts with the intent of destroying or stealing information.
The state-of-the-art malicious code attack is the polymorphic, or multivector, worm.
These attack programs use several known attack vectors to exploit a variety of vulner-
abilities in commonly used software. Table 1-2 outlines the six categories of known
attack vectors.

Password Attacks
A number of attacks attempt to bypass access controls by guessing passwords; this is
sometimes called password cracking. Such attacks range from making educated guesses
based on the individual’s background to guessing every possible combination of letters, num-
bers, and special characters. The most common password attacks are examined here:
Rainbow Tables One popular password attack, variously called a rainbow attack, a pre-
computed hash attack, or a time-memory tradeoff attack, uses a database of precomputed
hashes (or rainbow tables) derived from sequentially calculated passwords to look up the
hashed password and read out the text version. A rainbow attack is used when a copy of
the hash of the user’s password has been obtained. When a match is found, the password
has been cracked.
Brute Force Attacks Using computing and network resources to try every possible
combination of available characters, numbers, and symbols for a password is called a brute
force attack. Because this often involves repeatedly guessing the passwords to commonly
used accounts, it is sometimes called a guessing attack. If attackers can narrow the field of
target accounts, they can devote more time and resources to attacking fewer accounts.
That is one reason to change the names of common accounts from the manufacturer’s
default names.
Although often effective against low-security systems, brute force attacks are often not use-
ful against systems that have adopted the usual security practices recommended by manu-
facturers. Controls that limit the number of attempts allowed per unit of elapsed time are
very effective at combating these attacks. Defenses against brute force attacks are usually

Description
IP scan and attack
The infected system scans a random or local range of IP addresses and targets any of
several vulnerabilities known to hackers or left over from previous exploits.
Web browsing
If the infected system has write access to any Web pages, it makes all Web content
files (.html, .asp, .cgi, and others) infectious, so that users who browse to those pages
become infected.
Virus
Each infected machine infects certain common executable or script files on all
computers to which it can write with virus code that can cause infection.
Unprotected shares
Using vulnerabilities in file systems and the way many organizations configure them,
the infected machine copies the viral component to all locations it can reach.
Mass mail
By sending e-mail infections to recipients in the address book, the infected machine
infects many users, whose mail-reading programs also automatically run the program
and infect other systems.
Simple Network
Management Protocol
(SNMP)
By using the common passwords that were employed in early versions of this protocol,
widely used for remote management of network and computer devices, the attacker
program can gain control of a device.

adopted early on in any security effort and are thoroughly covered in the SANS/FBI list of
the Top 20 Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities.6
Dictionary A variation on the brute force attack, the dictionary attack narrows the field
by selecting specific target accounts and using a list of commonly used passwords (the dic-
tionary) instead of random combinations. Organizations can use similar dictionaries to
disallow passwords during the reset process and, thus, guard against easy-to-guess pass-
words. In addition, rules requiring additional numbers and/or special characters make the
dictionary attack less effective.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service
(DDoS) Attacks
In a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, the attacker sends a large number of connection or
information requests to a target (see Figure 1-5). So many requests are made that the tar-
get system cannot handle them along with other, legitimate requests for service. The sys-
tem may crash, or it may simply be unable to perform ordinary functions. A distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) launches a coordinated stream of requests against a target from
many locations at the same time. Most DDoS attacks are preceded by a preparation
phase in which many systems, perhaps thousands, are compromised. The compromised
machines are turned into zombies (or bots), machines that are directed remotely (usually
via transmitted command) by the attacker to participate in the attack. DDoS attacks
are the most difficult to defend against. There are, however, some cooperative efforts to
enable DDoS defenses among groups of service providers; among them is the Consensus
Roadmap for Defeating Distributed Denial of Service Attacks.7 To use a popular metaphor,
DDoS is considered a weapon of mass destruction on the Internet.8
In a denial-of-service attack, a hacker compromises a system and uses that
system to attack the target computer, flooding it with more requests for
services than the target can handle.
In a distributed denial-of-service attack, dozens or even hundreds of computers
(known as zombies) are compromised, loaded with DoS attack software, and
then remotely activated by the hacker to conduct a coordinated attack.

Any system connected to the Internet that provides TCP-based network services (such as a
Web server, FTP server, or mail server) is a potential target for denial-of-service attacks.
Note that in addition to attacks launched at specific hosts, these attacks can be launched
against routers or other network server systems if these hosts enable (or turn on) other TCP
services (e.g., echo). Even though such attacks make use of a fundamental element of the
TCP protocol used by all systems, the consequences of the attacks may vary, depending
on the system.9
Spoofing
Spoofing is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to computers, wherein the
intruder sends messages whose IP addresses indicate to the recipient that the messages are
coming from a trusted host. To engage in IP spoofing, a hacker must first use a variety of
techniques to find an IP address of a trusted host and then modify the packet headers
(see Figure 1-6) so that it appears that the packets are coming from that host.10 Newer
routers and firewall arrangements can offer protection against IP spoofing.
Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
In the well-known man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker monitors (or sniffs) packets from
the network, modifies them using IP spoofing techniques, and inserts them back into the
network, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop as well as to change, delete, reroute, add,
forge, or divert data.11 In a variant attack, the spoofing involves the interception of an encryp-
tion key exchange, which enables the hacker to act as an invisible man-in-the-middle—that is,
eavesdropper—in encrypted exchanges. Figure 1-7 illustrates these attacks by showing how a
hacker uses public and private encryption keys to intercept messages.

E-Mail Attacks
A number of attacks focus on the use of e-mail to deny service to the user (a form of DoS),
exploit the inexperience or vulnerability of the user, or trick the user into installing back-
doors or viruses. In general, e-mail is more the vehicle for the attack than the attack itself.
However, there are also specific e-mail attacks, including spam and mail bombing.
Spam Spam, or unsolicited commercial e-mail, has been used as a means of making mali-
cious code attacks more effective. In some cases, malicious code is embedded in files that
are included as attachments to spam.12 The most significant impact of spam, however, is
the waste of both computer and human resources. Many organizations attempt to cope
with the flood of spam by using filtering technologies to stem the flow. Other organiza-
tions simply tell users of the mail system to delete unwanted messages.
Mail Bomb Another form of e-mail attack is a mail bomb, in which an attacker routes
large quantities of e-mail to the target system. This can be accomplished through social
engineering (to be discussed shortly) or by exploiting various technical flaws in the Simple
Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP). The target of the attack receives unmanageably large
volumes of unsolicited e-mail. By sending large e-mails with forged header information,
attackers can take advantage of poorly configured e-mail systems and trick them into sending
many e-mails to an address chosen by the attacker. If many such systems are tricked into
participating in the event, the target e-mail address is buried under thousands or even mil-
lions of unwanted e-mails.

Sniffers
A sniffer is a program or device that monitors data traveling over a network. Sniffers can be
used both for legitimate network management functions and for stealing information from a
network. Unauthorized sniffers can be extremely dangerous to a network’s security because
they are virtually impossible to detect and can be inserted almost anywhere. This makes
them a favorite weapon in the hacker’s arsenal. Sniffers often work on TCP/IP networks,
where they are sometimes referred to as packet sniffers.13 Sniffers add risk to the network
because many systems and users send information on local networks in clear text. A sniffer
program shows all the data going by, including passwords, the data inside files (such as
word-processing documents), and screens full of sensitive data.
Social Engineering
Within the context of information security, social engineering is the process of using social
skills to convince people to reveal access credentials or other valuable information to the
attacker. This can be done in several ways, and usually involves the perpetrator posing as
a person higher in the organizational hierarchy than the victim. To prepare for this false
representation, the perpetrator may have used social engineering against others in the
organization to collect seemingly unrelated information that, when used together, makes
the false representation more credible. For instance, anyone can call the main switchboard
of a company and get the name of the CIO, but an attacker may find it just as easy to get
even more information by calling others in the company and asserting (false) authority by
mentioning the CIO’s name. Social engineering attacks may involve individuals posing as
new employees or as current employees who pathetically need assistance to avoid getting
fired. Sometimes, attackers threaten, cajole, or beg to sway the target.
The Advance Fee Fraud (AFF), internationally known as the “419” fraud, is an example of
a social engineering attack. Named after a section of the Nigerian penal code, these
schemes often involve fictitious companies, such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Com-
pany, but the perpetrators may invent other entities as well—a bank, a government
agency, or a nongovernmental organization, such as a lottery corporation. Funds are sto-
len from individuals who think they’re participating in money-making ventures; first,
they’re asked to send money up front, then they’re charged an endless series of fees. Some
4-1-9 schemes are suspected of involving kidnapping, extortion, and murder, and they
have, according to the Secret Service, bilked over $100 million from unsuspecting Ameri-
cans lured into disclosing personal banking information.
The infamous hacker Kevin Mitnick had this to say about attacks: “People are the weakest
link. You can have the best technology, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems, biometric
devices, [then] somebody calls an unsuspecting employee. That’s all she wrote, baby. They got
everything.”14
Buffer Overflow
A buffer overflow is an application error that occurs when more data is sent to a buffer
than it can handle. During a buffer overflow, the attacker can make the target system exe-
cute instructions, or the attacker can take advantage of some other unintended consequence of

the failure. Sometimes, this is limited to a denial-of-service attack, when the attacked sys-
tem crashes and is (until it is restarted) rendered unavailable to users. In either case, data
on the attacked system loses integrity.15 In 1998, Microsoft revealed that Internet Explorer
it had been vulnerable to a buffer overflow problem, as described here:
Microsoft acknowledged that if you type a res:// URL (a Microsoft-devised type
of URL) which is longer than 256 characters in Internet Explorer 4.0, the
browser will crash. No big deal, except that anything after the 256th character
can be executed on the computer. This maneuver, known as a buffer overrun, is
just about the oldest hacker trick in the book. Tack some malicious code (say, an
executable version of the Pentium-crashing FooF code) onto the end of the URL,
and you have the makings of a disaster.16
Timing Attacks
The timing attack works by measuring the time required to access a Web page and deducing
that the user has visited the site before by the presence of the page in the browser’s cache.
Another attack by the same name is a side channel attack on cryptographic algorithms using
measurements of the time required to perform cryptographic functions.17
Security Professionals and the Organization
It takes a wide range of professionals to support a diverse information security program.
Senior management is the key component, but administrative support is also needed to
develop and execute specific security policies and procedures, and technical expertise is
needed to implement the details of the information security program. What follows are
descriptions of the various positions that information security professionals hold in a typical
organization.
Executive Management
The chief information officer (CIO) is often the senior technology officer. Titles such as vice
president (VP) of information, VP of information technology, and VP of systems may also be
used. The CIO is primarily responsible for advising the chief executive officer, president,
or company owner on the strategic planning that affects the management of information
in the organization.
The chief information security officer (CISO) is the individual primarily responsible for
the assessment, management, and implementation of information security in the organi-
zation. The CISO may also be referred to as the manager for IT security, the security
administrator, or a similar title. The CISO usually reports directly to the CIO, although in
larger organizations it is common for one or more layers of management to exist between
the two.

Information Security Project Team
The information security project team consists of a number of individuals who are experi-
enced in one or more facets of the vast array of required technical and nontechnical areas.
Many of the same skills needed to manage and implement security are needed to design
the security system. Members of the security project team fill the following roles:
●
Champion—A senior executive who promotes the project and ensures that it is
supported, both financially and administratively, at the highest levels of the
organization
●
Team leader—A project manager (it may be a departmental line manager or staff
unit manager) who understands project management, personnel management, and
information security technical requirements
●
Security policy developers—Individuals who understand the organizational culture,
existing policies, and requirements for developing and implementing successful
policies
●
Risk assessment specialists—Individuals who understand financial risk assessment
techniques, the value of organizational assets, and the security methods to be used
●
Security professionals—Dedicated, trained, and well-educated specialists in all
aspects of information security, both technical and nontechnical
●
Systems, network, and storage administrators—Individuals with the primary
responsibility for administering the systems, data storage, and networks that
house and provide access to the organization’s information
●
End users—Those who will be most directly affected by new implementations and
changes to existing systems. Ideally, a selection of users from various departments,
levels, and degrees of technical knowledge assist the team in focusing on the appli-
cation of realistic controls applied in ways that do not disrupt the essential business
activities they seek to safeguard.
Information Security Policy, Standards, and Practices
A policy is guidance or instructions that an organization’s senior management implements
to regulate the activities of the organization members who make decisions, take actions, and
perform other duties. Policies are like laws in that they dictate acceptable and unacceptable
behavior within the organization. Like laws, policies define what is right and what is wrong,
what the penalties are for violating policies, and what the appeal process is. Standards,
although they have the same compliance requirement as policies, are more detailed descrip-
tions of what must be done to comply with policy. The standards may be informal or part of
an organizational culture; these are referred to as de facto standards. Alternatively, standards
may be published, scrutinized, and ratified by a group; these are referred to as de jure stan-
dards. Practices, procedures, and guidelines effectively explain how to comply with policy.
Figure 1-8 shows policies as the force that drives standards, which in turn drive practices, pro-
cedures, and guidelines.

Management must make policies the basis for all information security planning, design,
and deployment. Policies direct how issues are addressed and how technologies are used.
Policies do not specify the proper operation of equipment or software—this information
should be placed in the standards, procedures, and practices of users’ manuals and systems
documentation. In addition, policy should never contradict governmental laws; this can
create a significant liability for the organization.
Because information security is primarily a management problem, not a technical one, high-
quality security programs begin and end with policy.18 Policy obliges personnel to function
in a manner that adds to the security of information assets rather than threatens them. Secu-
rity policies are the least expensive control to design and disseminate—they require only the
time and effort of the management team—but they are the most difficult to implement prop-
erly. Even if the management team hires an outside consultant to assist in the development
of policy, the costs are minimal compared to those of technical controls.
For a policy to be effective and legally enforceable, it must meet the following criteria:
●
Dissemination (distribution)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that the
relevant policy has been made readily available for review by the employee. Common
dissemination techniques include hard-copy and electronic distribution.
●
Review (reading)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that it dissemi-
nated the document in an intelligible form, including versions for illiterate, non-
English-reading, and reading-impaired employees. Often, organizations record
versions of the policy in English and alternate languages.
●
Comprehension (understanding)—The organization must be able to demonstrate
that employees understood the requirements and content of the policy. Techniques
include quizzes and other assessments.
●
Compliance (agreement)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that
employees have agreed to comply with the policy, either through act or affirmation.
Techniques include log-on banners that require a specific action (mouse click or

keystroke) to acknowledge agreement or documents that employees sign to indicate
that they have read, understood, and agreed to comply with the policy.
●
Uniformity (equality of application)—The organization must be able to demonstrate
that the policy has been uniformly enforced throughout the organization.
Policies are put in place to support the organization’s mission, vision, and strategic plan-
ning. The mission is a written statement of the organization’s purpose. The vision is a writ-
ten statement of the organization’s long-term goals. (Where will it be in five years? Ten?)
Strategic planning is the process of moving the organization towards its vision.
What the term security policy means depends on the context in which it is used. Govern-
mental agencies discuss security policy in terms of national security and national policies
to deal with foreign states. A security policy can also be a credit card agency’s method of
processing credit card numbers. In general, a security policy is a set of rules that protect an
organization’s assets. An information security policy provides rules for the protection of
the information assets of the organization.
Management must define three types of security policies:
●
Enterprise information security policies
●
Issue-specific security policies
●
Systems-specific security policies19
Each of these types of management policy is examined in greater detail in the sections
that follow.
Enterprise Information Security Policy (EISP)
An enterprise information security policy (EISP) is also known as a general security policy,
IT security policy, or information security policy. It is based on and directly supports the
mission, vision, and direction of the organization and sets the strategic direction, scope,
and tone for all security efforts. The EISP is an executive-level document, usually drafted
by, or in cooperation with, the chief information officer of the organization. It is usually
two to ten pages long and shapes the philosophy of security in the IT environment. The
EISP usually needs to be modified only when there is a change in the strategic direction of
the organization.
The EISP guides the development, implementation, and management of the security pro-
gram. It specifies the requirements to be met by the information security blueprint or frame-
work. It defines the purpose, scope, constraints, and applicability of the security program
in the organization. It also assigns responsibilities for the various areas of security, includ-
ing systems administration, maintenance of the information security policies, and the prac-
tices and responsibilities of the users. Finally, it addresses legal compliance in two areas:
●
General compliance to ensure meeting the requirements to establish a program and
the responsibilities assigned therein to various organizational components
●
The use of specified penalties and disciplinary action20
When the EISP has been developed, the CISO begins forming the security team and initiating
the necessary changes to the information security program.

EISP Components Although the specifics of EISPs vary from organization to organiza-
tion, most EISP documents include the components shown in Table 1-3.21
Issue-Specific Security Policy (ISSP)
As an organization executes various technologies and processes to support routine opera-
tions, it must instruct employees on the proper use of those technologies and processes.
The issue-specific security policy (ISSP), which requires frequent updates, addresses specific
areas of technology, stating the organization’s position on each issue.23 Here are some of
the issues it may cover:
●
Use of company-owned networks and the Internet
●
Use of telecommunications technologies (fax and phone)
●
Use of e-mail
●
Specific minimum configurations of computers to defend against worms and viruses
●
Prohibitions against hacking or testing organization security controls

Systems-Specific Policy (SysSP)
Whereas issue-specific policies are written documents readily identifiable as policy, system-
specific security policies (SysSPs) sometimes have a different look. They can be separated into
two general areas, managerial guidance and technical specifications, or they can be combined
into a single policy document.
Managerial Guidance SysSPs A managerial guidance SysSP document is created by
management to guide the implementation and configuration of technology, as well as to
regulate the behavior of people in the organization. For example, although the method for
implementing a firewall belongs in the technical specifications SysSP, the firewall’s config-
uration must follow guidelines established by management. An organization might not
want its employees to have access to the Internet via the organization’s network, for
instance; in that case, the firewall would have to be implemented accordingly.
Technical Specifications SysSPs Whereas a manager can work with a systems admin-
istrator to create managerial policy, the system administrator may in turn need to create a pol-
icy to implement the managerial policy. Each type of equipment requires its own set of policies
to translate the managerial intent into an enforceable technical approach. For example, an ISSP
may require that user passwords be changed quarterly; a systems administrator can implement
a technical control within a specific application to enforce this policy. There are two general
methods for implementing such technical controls: access control lists and configuration rules.
Access control lists (ACLs) consist of the user access lists, matrices, and capability tables
that govern the rights and privileges of users. ACLs can control access to file storage systems,
software components, or network communications devices. A capability table specifies
which subjects and objects users or groups can access; in some systems, capability tables
are called user profiles or user policies. These specifications frequently take the form of
complex matrices rather than simple lists or tables. The access control matrix includes a com-
bination of tables and lists; organizational assets are listed along the column headers, and
users are listed along the row headers. The resulting matrix contains ACLs in columns for
a particular device or asset, and a row contains the capability table for a particular user.
Configuration rule policies are the specific instructions entered into a security system to
regulate how it reacts to the data it receives. Rule-based policies are more specific to the
operation of a system than ACLs are, and they may or may not deal with users directly.
Many security systems—for example, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and
proxy servers—use specific configuration rules to determine how the system handles each
data element they process.
Frameworks and Industry Standards in Information
Security
After the information security team has inventoried the organization’s information assets
and assessed and prioritized the threats to those assets, it must conduct a series of risk assess-
ments using quantitative or qualitative analyses, as well as feasibility studies and cost-benefit
analyses. These assessments, which include determining each asset’s current protection
level, are used to decide whether or not to proceed with any given control. Armed with a

general idea of the vulnerabilities in the information technology systems, the security team
develops a design blueprint for security, which is used to implement the security program.
This security blueprint is the basis for the design, selection, and implementation of all secu-
rity program elements, including policy implementation, ongoing policy management, risk
management programs, education and training programs, technological controls, and
maintenance of the security program. The security blueprint, built on top of the organiza-
tion’s information security policies, is a scalable, upgradable, comprehensive plan to meet
the organization’s current and future information security needs. It is a detailed version of
the security framework, which is an outline of the overall information security strategy and
a roadmap for planned changes to the organization’s information security environment.
The blueprint specifies the tasks in the order in which they are to be accomplished.
To select a methodology by which to develop an information security blueprint, you can
adapt or adopt a published information security model or framework. This framework can
be an outline of steps to take to design and implement information security in the organiza-
tion. There are a number of published information security frameworks, including ones from
government sources, which are presented later in this chapter. Because each information
security environment is unique, the security team may need to modify or adapt pieces from
several frameworks; what works well for one organization may not precisely fit another.
The ISO 27000 Series
One of the most widely referenced security models is Information Technology – Code of Prac-
tice for Information Security Management, which was originally published as British Standard
7799. In 2000, this code of practice was adopted as an international standard framework for
information security by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Inter-
national Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as ISO/IEC 17799 (or more commonly just ISO
17799). It was revised in 2005 (becoming ISO 17799:2005) and renumbered ISO 27002 in
2007 in order to align it with the document ISO 27001, which is discussed later in this chapter.
Although the details of ISO 27002 are available to those who purchase the standard, its struc-
ture and general organization are well known. For a summary description, see Table 1-5.

The stated purpose of ISO 27002 is to “give recommendations for information security manage-
ment for use by those who are responsible for initiating, implementing, or maintaining security in
their organization. It is intended to provide a common basis for developing organizational security
standards and effective security management practice and to provide confidence in interorganiza-
tional dealings.”25 Whereas ISO/IEC 27002 offers a broad overview of the various areas of security,
providing information on 127 controls over 12 broad areas, ISO/IEC 27001 provides information
on how to implement ISO/IEC 27002 and how to set up an information security management sys-
tem (ISMS). The overall methodology for this process and its major steps are presented in Figure 1-9.

In 2007, ISO announced plans for the issuance of forthcoming standards related to informa-
tion security issues and topics (see Table 1-6).
NIST Security Models
Another approach to security standards is described in documents available from the
Computer Security Resource Center of the National Institute for Standards and Technol-
ogy (csrc.nist.gov). Because the NIST documents are publicly available, free, and have
been available for some time, they have been broadly reviewed by government and indus-
try professionals and were among the references cited by the federal government when it
decided not to select the ISO 17799 standards. The following NIST documents can assist
in the design of a security framework:

IETF Security Architecture
The Security Area Working Group acts as an advisory board for the protocols and areas
developed and promoted by the Internet Society and the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), and although the group endorses no specific information security architecture, one
of its requests for comment, RFC 2196: Site Security Handbook, offers a good discussion of
important security issues. The handbook covers five basic areas of security, with detailed dis-
cussions on development and implementation. There are also chapters on such important
topics as security policies, security technical architecture, security services, and security inci-
dent handling.
Benchmarking and Best Business Practices
Benchmarking and best practices are methods used by some organizations to assess secu-
rity practices. They don’t provide a complete methodology for the design and implementa-
tion of all the practices needed by an organization; however, it is possible to formulate the
desired outcome of the security process and work backwards toward an effective design.
The Federal Agency Security Practices (FASP) Web site (fasp.nist.gov) is a popular place
to look up best practices. FASP provides best practices for public agencies, but these prac-
tices can be adapted easily to private institutions. The documents found at this site include
specific examples of key policies and planning documents, implementation strategies for
key technologies, and position descriptions for key security personnel.
A number of other public and private institutions provide information on best practices.
One such group is the SANS Institute (http://www.sans.org), which is a cooperative infor-
mation security research and education organization. The organization provides recom-
mendations for security implementations and policies. Other widely referenced sources
include the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Car-
negie Mellon University (www.cert.org) and the United States Computer Emergency Readi-
ness Team (US-CERT, http://www.us-cert.gov). These organizations provide detailed and
specific assistance on how to implement sound security methodologies.
Spheres of Security The spheres of security, shown in Figure 1-10, are the founda-
tion of the security framework. Generally speaking, they illustrate that information is
under attack from a variety of sources. The sphere of use, on the left side of Figure 1-10,
illustrates the ways in which people access information; for example, people read hard
copies of documents but can also access information through systems. Information, as the
most important asset in this model, is at the center of the sphere. Information is always at
risk from the people and computer systems that have access to it. Networks and the Inter-
net represent indirect threats, because a person attempting to access information from the

Internet must first go through the local networks and then access systems that contain the
information. The sphere of protection, on the right side of Figure 1-10, illustrates that
between each layer of the sphere of use there must exist a layer of protection to prevent
access to the inner layer from the outer layer. Each shaded band is a layer of protection
and control. For example, the items labeled “Policy & law” and “Education & training”
are located between people and the information. Controls are also implemented between
systems and the information, between networks and the computer systems, and between
the Internet and internal networks. This reinforces the concept of defense in depth. As
illustrated in the sphere of protection, a variety of controls can be used to protect the
information. The items of control shown in the figure are not intended to be comprehen-
sive, but they illustrate individual safeguards that can protect the various systems that are
located closer to the center of the sphere. However, because people can directly access
each ring, as well as the information at the core of the model, the side of the sphere of pro-
tection that attempts to control access by relying on people requires a different approach
to security than the side that uses technology. The members of the organization must
become a safeguard that is effectively implemented and maintained or else they too repre-
sent a threat to the information.
Information security is designed and implemented in three layers: policies, people, and
technology. Although the design and implementation of the people layer and the technol-
ogy layer overlap, both must follow the sound management policies discussed earlier in
this chapter. Each of the layers contains controls and safeguards that protect the valuable
information and information system assets. Before any technical controls or other safeguards
are put into place, however, the policies defining the management philosophies that guide the
security process must already be in place.

Defense in Depth One of the basic tenets of security architectures is the layered imple-
mentation of security. This layered approach is called defense in depth. To achieve defense
in depth, an organization must establish multiple layers of security controls and safeguards,
which can be organized into policy, training and education, and technology per the
NSTISSC model. Although policy itself may not prevent attacks, it certainly prepares the
organization to handle them, and coupled with other layers, it can deter attacks. This is
true of training and education, which can also provide some defense against attacks stem-
ming from employee ignorance and social engineering. Technology is also implemented in
layers, with detection equipment working in tandem with reaction technology, all operat-
ing behind access control mechanisms. Implementing multiple types of technology and
thereby preventing the failure of one system from compromising the security of informa-
tion is referred to as redundancy. Redundancy can be implemented at a number of points
throughout the security architecture—for example, firewalls, proxy servers, and access
controls. Figure 1-11 illustrates the concept of building controls in multiple, sometimes
redundant, layers. The figure shows the use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems
(IDS) that use both packet-level rules (shown as the header in the diagram) and data con-
tent analysis (shown as 0100101011 in the diagram).
Security Perimeter A security perimeter defines the boundary between the outer limit
of an organization’s security and the beginning of the outside world. A security perimeter
protects all internal systems from outside threats, as shown in Figure 1-12. There can be
both an electronic security perimeter, usually at the organization’s exterior network or
Internet connection, and a physical security perimeter, usually at the gate to the organiza-
tion’s offices. Both require perimeter security. Security perimeters can be implemented as
multiple technologies that segregate the protected information from potential attackers.
Within security perimeters, the organization can establish security domains—areas of trust

within which users can freely communicate. The assumption is that if individuals have
access to one system within a security domain, they have authorized access to all systems
within that particular domain. The security perimeter is an essential element of the overall
security framework, and its implementation details are the core of the completed security
blueprint. The key components used for planning the perimeter include firewalls, DMZs,
proxy servers, and intrusion detection systems.
It should be noted that the traditional boundaries of the perimeter are fading. The prolifera-
tion of endpoints, such as mobile devices, is destroying the traditional definition of an organi-
zation’s perimeter.26 Enterprises must carefully consider how these new technologies can rede-
fine where the perimeter actually falls, or if a perimeter exists at all. Additionally, organizations
are becoming more concerned with internal attacks from employee threats or on-site physical
threats. These two major concerns violate the assumption that all systems within the security
perimeter should be trusted.
Chapter Summary
■
Before learning how to plan, design, and implement network security, it is important
to understand the larger issue of information security. Learning about the overall
picture of information security helps you become aware of these areas that affect
firewalls and network security.
■
Information security is the protection of information and its critical elements,
including the systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit that information.
The C.I.A. triad is based on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information and the systems that process it.

The value of information comes from the characteristics it possesses. When a charac-
teristic of information changes, the value of that information either increases or, more
commonly, decreases.
■
The CNSS Security model is known as the McCumber Cube and was created by John
McCumber in 1991. It provides a graphical description of the architectural approach
widely used in computer and information security.
■
Information security cannot be an absolute; it is a process, not a goal. Information
security should balance protection and availability. To achieve balance—that is,
to operate an information system to the satisfaction of the user and the security
professional—the level of security must allow reasonable access yet protect against
threats.
■
Information security performs four important organizational functions: protects
the organization’s ability to function, enables the safe operation of applications
implemented on the organization’s IT systems, protects the data the organization
collects and uses, and safeguards the technology assets in use at the organization.
■
A threat is an object, person, or other entity that represents a constant danger to an
asset. Twelve categories have been developed to represent the dangers posed to an
organization’s people, information, and systems. They are: (1) human error or failure,
(2) compromises to intellectual property, (3) espionage or trespass, (4) information
extortion, (5) sabotage or vandalism, (6) theft, (7) software attacks, (8) forces of
nature, (9) deviations in quality of service, (10) hardware failures or errors,
(11) software failures or errors, and (12) obsolescence.
■
An attack is an action that takes advantage of a vulnerability to compromise a
controlled system. A vulnerability is an identified weakness in a controlled system.
An attack is a specific action that may cause a potential loss. Types of attack
include: malicious code, backdoors, password cracking, denial-of-service (DoS) and
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), spoofing, man-in-the-middle, spam, mail
bombs, sniffers, social engineering, buffer overflow, and timing attacks.
■
It takes a wide range of professionals and skills to support the information security
program, from senior management and administrative support to technical expertise.
The following job positions are involved with information security: chief information
officer (CIO), chief information security officer (CISO), members of the information
security project team (including team leader, security policy developers, risk assess-
ment specialists, security professionals, systems, network and storage administrators,
and end users. In order to most effectively secure its networks, an organization must
establish a functional and well-designed information security program in the context
of a well-planned and fully defined information policy and planning environment.
The creation of an information security program requires information security
policies, standards, and practices, an information security architecture, and a detailed
information security blueprint.
■
Management must make policy the basis for all information security planning,
design, and deployment in order to direct how issues are addressed and how
technologies are used. Policy must never conflict with laws, must stand up in court,
if challenged, and must be properly administered through dissemination and

documented acceptance. For a policy to be considered effective and legally enforceable,
it must be disseminated, reviewed, understood, complied with, and uniformly
enforced. Policy is implemented with an overall enterprise information security
policy and as many issues-specific and system-specific policies as are required to

Real-World Exercises
Exercise 1-1
Using an existing security policy, build an effective security education presentation. The
presentation should be geared to the computer layman, should highlight the important
portions of the security policy, and should point end users to both the security policy and
additional help. Additionally, list five different ways that you could deliver effective educa-
tion to the necessary audience.
Exercise 1-2
Applying software patches to fix security vulnerabilities is one of the most effective secu-
rity measures you can use to protect your environment. Find a reputable Internet source
from which to receive security advisories. Now that the advisory information is flowing
to you, develop a process to receive, assess, and distribute the advisories. In addition, the
process should address how you identify all the systems to which the advisory applies and
track the progress of testing and installing the proper patches.
Hands-On Projects
Project 1-1
The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is a risk assessment formula that cal-
culates the potential financial loss from perceived threats. Based on the ALE
calculation, one can determine which assets hold the greatest value, prioritize
the protection of those assets, and determine which security measures will best benefit the
business. The formula is as follows: ALE = SLE * ARO, where SLE refers to Single Loss
Expectancy and ARO refers to Annualized Rate of Occurrence. SLE is determined by multi-
plying an asset’s value by the Exposure Factor (EF). The first component of SLE, the asset
value, is the total monetary amount determined from the cost of the hardware, software,
training, support, and other costs of maintaining the system—otherwise known as total cost
of ownership (TCO.) The asset value should also include the value to the organization of the
applications and data on the system. The second component, Exposure Factor (EF), is the
percentage of asset loss that is expected from a particular threat. In this project, you use
the ALE formula to compute possible financial loss from computer attacks. To complete
this project, you need a pencil and paper.
1.
For this project, assume that an organization has five servers. Server 1 has a TCO of
$25,000, Servers 2 and 3 have a TCO of $37,000 each, and the remaining two servers—
Servers 4 and 5—have a TCO of $42,000 each. The servers are not used by internal
employees but are used by Web visitors. The total income that all five servers brings
in is $5 million a year (equally provided by all five servers). Compute the total asset
value for each of the five servers.
2.
In order to recover from an attack on any one server, it would take an estimated 14
hours to rebuild Servers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 37 hours to rebuild Server 5. If each server
is required to be online 8,760 hours a year, compute the EF for each server.

Introduction
To computer users, the network is a transparent entity. A user logs on to his or her workstation
and uses a variety of tools to communicate with other users and other computer systems. He or
she expects e-mail, instant messaging, and Web browsing to work. After all, if the data is there
in a timely fashion, who cares how it got there?
Network administrators care. Networks provide the blood flow for the computing environ-
ment and must be managed efficiently around the clock. Networks are typically composed of
hundreds or even thousands of miles of data arteries and veins. Each network component is
designed to ensure that information continues to flow efficiently to all consumers. The burden
of maintaining this vital IT resource is left to the network administrators.
Hackers also care—those miscreants who seek to use computers and networks for unintended,
unauthorized, and often illegal purposes. By design, the increasing complexity of network com-
munication speeds up and increases the amount of data users can share. However, by mastering
It has been several years since EBS established a connection in order to share real-
time information with its suppliers. In order to efficiently replace office supplies, EBS’s
order management had given its business partner, Davis Office Megaplex, access to the
EBS inventory management system. Enabled with this type of real-time access, Davis
Office Megaplex periodically checks inventory levels and restocks office supplies when
levels drop below certain thresholds. The order management project called for a new
type of network connection: an extranet.
Until establishing that type of connection, EBS used an internal network, a small, pro-
tected network for Web servers called a demilitarized zone (or DMZ), and outbound
access to the Internet. The extranet connection and partner relationship streamlined
EBS’s ordering process and allowed the OM department to reduce its staff. In addition,
the other departments at EBS benefited by avoiding the problems caused by running
out of office supplies at crucial times.
Now, the key for EBS in general, and its IT department in particular, is to make sure
this critical network connection has the necessary security controls so that data is
protected in transit and no unauthorized users can use the connection. Luckily, Paige
Davis, the network administrator, is well versed in EBS’s network architecture. How-
ever, it has been some time since she looked into the network technologies and
devices involved with the extranet connection. To ensure security controls are properly
in place for the upcoming audit, it is time to get back to basics and relearn the various
network technologies involved.

the complexity of network protocols, attackers can also subvert network devices and com-
munications for malicious purposes. Security professionals must recognize this fact and help
network administrators keep this vital arterial system protected. This chapter outlines many of
the technologies that network administrators—and security professionals—must support
and protect. It serves as a survey of the essentials of computer networking.
Networking Fundamentals
In a fundamental exchange of information between two parties, one party—the sender—
communicates a message to a second party—the receiver—over some medium, as illustrated
in Figure 2-1.
Communication can only occur when the recipient is able to receive, process, and comprehend
the message. This one-way flow of information from sender to receiver is referred to as a
channel. When the recipient also becomes a sender—for example, by responding to the origi-
nal sender’s message—this two-way flow of information is called a circuit.
Reasons to Network
Data communications and networking go hand in hand. Data communications is the exchange
of computer-based or other digital messages across a medium. Networking is the interconnec-
tion of groups or systems with the purpose of exchanging information. There are a number of
reasons to build a network:
●
Exchanging information—First and foremost, we create networks to exchange
information among entities, both human and electronic. This information could
be stored in databases, created in processing, or obtained from external inputs.
The modern extensions of information exchange include e-mail, instant messaging,
video conferencing, and online seminar broadcasting.

●
Sharing scarce or expensive resources—A typical organization may not be able to
afford expensive equipment for every member. For example, a standard laser printer
may cost between $300 and $500. For an organization with 1,000 members, the costs
to provide one to each member would be $300,000–$500,000. Instead, workgroups
could share equipment that’s more expensive, more reliable, and more full featured,
thereby saving the organization money.
●
Allowing distributed organizations to act as if centrally located—With the almost
instant communications capabilities of today’s Internet, interaction among members
of an organization can be even faster and more productive than face-to-face
meetings. Instead of the travel and scheduling complications of face-to-face meetings
for dispersed groups, video conferencing can provide instant exchange of ideas.
Communications has evolved to the point where an individual really does not need
to care about where his or her peers are, only if they are able to respond in a
timely manner.
Getting the Message Across
Communication requires the sender to get the message to the receiver successfully via a
medium. The process of placing a message on a medium usually requires some modification
or manipulation of the medium so that it can carry the message. This modification is referred
to as modulation. The sender modulates the medium—the signal—to carry the message.
The method used to embed the message on the signal depends on the type of message and
type of signal. As shown in Figure 2-2, there are two types of message (or information).
Analog information, such as voice communications, is carried on a medium that is constantly
changing, whereas digital information, such as computer communications, is discrete, alternat-
ing between a few values—in this case, 1s and 0s. Analog signals, such as those carried on the
public phone network (the human voice and music, most commonly), use continuously
varying waveforms, whereas discrete signals, such as those carried on computer networks,
use discrete values in defined voltage levels. The grid shown in Figure 2-2 indicates that
modulation may take one of four forms: analog to analog, analog to digital, digital to analog,
or digital to digital.
Analog Information on an Analog Medium The public telephone network and
commercial radio stations have been embedding information on an analog medium for over
90 years. The embedding or modulation of an analog data source onto an analog signal
involves manipulating one or more of the three characteristics of a signal. As shown in Figure 2-3,
the analog signal has height (amplitude), length (frequency), and a reference to an original
wave starting point (phase). Frequency is measured in hertz—named after the scientist Heinrich
Rudolf Hertz, who pioneered radio wave production and detection. One wave iteration or
cycle per second is one hertz (Hz), one thousand cycles per second is one kilohertz (KHz),
and one million cycles per second is one megahertz (MHz), and so forth. By altering a
wave’s amplitude, frequency, and phase, analog information can be stored and transmitted.
In modern communications, more than one characteristic may be modified at the same time.
Most common voice networks use a functional bandwidth of 4,000 hertz (4 KHz). Some of
this bandwidth is used to provide a buffer between adjacent bandwidths, such as between the
0 and 4,000 Hz bandwidth and the 4,000 and 8,000 Hz bandwidth. These buffers typically
result in a loss of 300 Hz on the lower end of the spectrum and 700 Hz on the upper end,

resulting in a typical usable bandwidth of approximately 3 KHz. Because most of the audible
component of human speech falls in this 300–3,300 Hz range, it has been commonplace
for several decades, becoming a de facto standard.
Analog Information on a Digital Medium With the explosion in popularity of
digital entertainment via CDs and DVDs, and with the rise of digital communications tech-
nologies like wireless telephony, digitizing analog data has become more commonplace. In
fact, the same technologies noted earlier are required in order to digitize analog information
found in older media formats so that they can be efficiently transmitted over a digital net-
work. The technologies involved are based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which
uses analog frequencies to encode one or more bits, by measuring the height of the signal.
The height measurements correspond to a digital value: “0,” “1,” or some multi-bit combi-
nation. PAM incorporates the Shannon-Nyquist theorem, which states that if a signal is
sampled at a rate at least twice the highest frequency and at regular intervals, the sample
will contain all the relevant information of the original signal. The most common version
of PAM, pulse code modulation (PCM), uses an 8-bit sample size. If we were to use PCM
on a standard voice channel of 4,000 Hz, then sampling at twice the highest frequency
would provide 8,000 samples of 8 bits each, for an equivalent digital signal of 64,000 bits
per second (bps). If we sample at greater rates (known as oversampling), the resulting signal
will have even more data embedded but will require greater bandwidth. Figure 2-4 provides
an illustration of PCM used in voice digitization.

An improvement on PCM—Adaptive Differential PCM (ADPCM)—requires only a 4-bit
code, given that it measures only the difference between sequential waves, thus requires a low
data rate to transmit. This technique is used in some voice over IP (VoIP) communications.
Digital to Analog In the early days of home Internet access, most people used a modem.
This modulator-demodulator converted the native digital data into an analog form capable
of traveling over the public phone networks. Modems embed digital data much the same
way that radios embed voices over the airwaves: by manipulating the basic characteristics
of the signal. As shown in Figure 2-5, the three techniques used to embed digital informa-
tion onto an analog signal are amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK),
and phase shift keying (PSK). Actually, a combination of these techniques is used to improve
data throughput. In the early days of modems, the term baud rate was used to represent the
speed of communications—that is, the number of signals transmitted per second. Now, with
the ability to embed multiple bits of information in each signal, the term has fallen out of
use in favor of bits per second (bps). (This is not to be confused with bytes per second
(Bps), used in describing the uploading and downloading of data files.)
Digital to Digital Embedding digital information onto a digital signal is performed by
computer hardware known as a transceiver (transmitter/receiver) or a network interface card
(NIC), which connects a computer to its network. The NIC modulates the current carried over
the network into a series of discrete voltage levels encoding the binary data. The more common
versions are described as “unipolar” or “bipolar,” which refers to whether the signal uses one
pole or two. They are also described as “return to zero” or “non-return to zero” level, which
refers to whether or not the signal drops to zero voltage, either between values or as a value

(see Figure 2-6). By using multiple voltage levels, multiple bits can be transmitted at the same
voltage level; for example, 4 volts could be 00, 3 volts could be 01, 2 volts could be 10, and
1 volt could be 11.
One of the challenges in digital communications is the transmission of a long string of values,
given that this requires careful synchronization between systems to keep the bit count on long
strings. The alternative is to embed a synchronization point in the bit stream—sort of like
using a metronome for a music performance. Ethernet LANs use Manchester encoding,
which provides a synchronization point in mid-bit, encodes a 1 bit as a transition between
a low and high value and a 0 bit as a shift between a high and low value. Most modern
Ethernet implementations use a voltage level of approximately +/- 1 volt, depending on the
technology deployed.
Combining Multiple Signals
Because the transmission of a single signal over long distances is inefficient, techniques have
been developed to carry additional data over the same media. The first is multi-bit encoding,
in which the signal levels described earlier are coded to allow the representation of more than
one bit per signal level. The second is the combination of several inputs onto a high-bandwidth
stream to carry multiple signals long distances. This method of combining signals is known
as multiplexing. The three dominant multiplexing methods in use today are frequency divi-
sion multiplexing, time division multiplexing, and wave division multiplexing.
Frequency Division Multiplexing Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is used
primarily in analog communications to combine voice channels. The standard voice channel
for analog communication on the telephone network is 0–4,000 Hz, with a built-in buffer to
prevent the channels from interfering with one another. FDM works by temporarily shifting

channels to higher frequencies, then moving them back on the far end of the high-capacity
connection. This technique is illustrated in Figure 2-7.
Time Division Multiplexing Time division multiplexing (TDM), used predominantly
in digital communications, assigns a time block to each client, then polls each client in suc-
cession to transmit a set of information (predefined byte or block). Each station sends its
information, which is recompiled into a cohesive data stream on the far end of the commu-
nication channel. If a station has no data to send, that time slot goes empty. Because this
was viewed as inefficient, though, a variant on TDM—statistical time division multiplexing
(STDM), also known as statistical multiplexing —has eliminated the dedicated time slots by
adding header information to each packet, allowing any station with traffic to transmit on
an as-needed basis. These techniques are also illustrated in Figure 2-7.
Wave Division Multiplexing Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM), found exclusively
in fiber-optic communications, uses different colors of light to allow multiple light-based
signals to travel on the same fiber-optic channel. This is a derivative of FDM, but only applies
to fiber-optic channels.

●
Attenuation—The loss of signal strength as the signal moves across media. Both wired
and wireless communications suffer from attenuation. The higher quality the media,
the less the degree of attenuation. Counteracting attenuation involves repeating
or amplifying the signal or using a higher grade or type of media—for example,
fiber-optic rather than copper cable.
●
Crosstalk—The effect of one communications channel upon another. Crosstalk occurs
when one transmission “bleeds” over to another (e.g., from one channel to another).
Cable shielding can help minimize the possibility of crosstalk, as can changing from
electrical or electromagnetic communications to photonic (fiber optic).
●
Distortion—The unintentional variation of the communication over the media.
Many items can affect the electrical or electromagnetic signal, including solar flares,
magnetic interference from florescent lighting, and even electrical cables. The same
techniques that mitigate crosstalk will counter the effects of distortion.
●
Echo—The reflection of a signal because of equipment malfunction or poor design.
The failure to properly terminate the physical medium (e.g., by failing to place a cap
on the end of early coaxial cable-based networks) leads to signal reflection: the
echoing of signals as they bounce back from the ends of the network. If you’ve
ever heard your own voice on a telephone conversation, you’ve experienced echo.
Repairing or replacing poorly designed or malfunctioning equipment usually
resolves echo.

Impulse noise—A sudden, short-lived increase in signal frequency or amplitude, also
known as a spike. Like distortion, impulse noise causes a temporary loss in signal
clarity. Some of the sources of distortion also cause impulse noise—solar flares, an
overloaded electrical circuit, or a short in a data communications channel. Because
these problems cannot be predicted or easily diagnosed, countering their effects is
usually difficult.
●
Jitter—Signal modification caused by malfunctioning equipment, such as a faulty
network interface card or hub. Jitter usually involves extra signal components in
(or unwanted modification of) the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the signal.
If you’ve listened to a CD skipping or playing at the wrong speed with click sounds,
you’ve heard jitter. Providing anti-jitter circuits (AJC) or buffers to provide some
measure of delay helps to counter jitter occurrence.
●
White noise—Unwanted noise from a signal coming across the media at multiple
frequencies, also referred to as static noise. It can be the result of the heat of the
electrons moving across electrical communications or poor-quality communication
circuits. The background hiss heard in telephone communications is white noise.
Moving from electrical to photonic communications can resolve this issue.
Types of Networks
Networks can be categorized by components, size, layout or topology, or media. These
categories ensure that practitioners can speak a common language when referring to networks.

Networks Categorized by Components
Networks categorized by their components include peer-to-peer (or P2P) networks, server-
based networks, and distributed multi-server networks. In peer-to-peer networks, the indi-
vidual users or clients directly interact with one another, sharing resources without the
benefit of a central repository or server. This level of connection is common in small office
or home networks, where users may share hard drives, directories, or printers. An exten-
sion of the P2P network is the Servant model, where a client shares part of its resources,
thereby serving as a pseudo-server—a device that provides services to others. The Servant
model became very popular in the late-1990s, when music-sharing services like Napster
were quickly adopted by end users. Even after legal issues associated with the unautho-
rized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted music caused Napster to be shut down
and dramatically redesigned, other variants like Kazaa, LimeWire, iMesh, Morpheus, and
BearShare adopted the model.
Server-based networks use a dedicated system to provide specific services to their clients.
These services may be hosted on a single general service system, or individual services
may be provided by multiple servers. These types of networks are discussed in the upcom-
ing sections on local and wide area networks. Distributed multi-server networks add dis-
tance and additional services to this model by separating the services outside the organization
from other organizations with other systems and servers.
Networks Categorized by Size
One of the most common methods of categorizing networks is by size. Originally, network
sizes were described as either local area or wide area. The Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics Engineers (IEEE) first defined a local area network (LAN) as a network with less than
3 miles of total cabling. The current definition is of a network containing a dedicated server
that provides services connecting systems within or between a few buildings, over a small geo-
graphic space. LANs are typically owned by a single organization and used to support its
internal communications.
The next largest size is a metropolitan area network (MAN), which typically covers a region
the size of a municipality, county, or district. The informal definition of a MAN is that it is
larger than a LAN but smaller than a wide area network (WAN).
A wide area network (WAN) is a very large network that covers a vast geographic region
like a state, a country, or even the planet. There are two dominant WANs: the public tele-
phone network and the Internet. (Note that the Internet begins with an uppercase I, whereas
an internet—an internetwork or network of networks—begins with a lowercase i.) There are
a host of other WANs, usually associated with one of the dominant communications infra-
structure providers. A WAN can comprise a collection of LANs and MANs.
Since these definitions were developed, a host of variations has arisen, including: personal
area networks, which typically connect a few devices owned by the same individual; file
area networks, which connect a number of data storage technologies; campus area net-
works, which are large LANs or small MANs that connect two or more LANs, typically
within adjacent buildings; and body area networks, which are personal devices carried on
one’s person that communicate with each other.

Networks Categorized by Topology
A topology is the pattern of associations among network components. The topology can be
physical or logical. Physical topologies indicate how networks are cabled, whereas logical
topologies indicate how they function. The most common physical topologies are ring, bus,
star, hierarchy, mesh, and hybrid (see Figure 2-8), whereas the most common logical topolo-
gies are bus and star. A bus is a linear communication channel and its associated nodes, the
messages being transmitted one at a time from one station or node to another, with each
node taking turns. The messages can travel in either direction (in the case of a physical bus)
or in just one direction (in the case of a physical ring). In a star logical topology, there is a
central node to which each station or node transmits, after which the message is retrans-
mitted to all the attached nodes.
Networks Categorized by Media
There are two categories for network media: guided and unguided, also known as wired and
wireless. Wired networks typically use electricity or light waves over cables to transmit
messages, whereas wireless media networks use radio or infrared electromagnetic energy.
Network media are discussed in the section on the TCP/IP Physical layer.
Standards Organizations
A number of organizations promote the standardization of data communication components.
Some seek to standardize the use of data communications, whereas others work on standard-
izing the design of data communications technologies and protocols—that is, the rules for
communications. Protocols that are widely accepted become standards. Some standards are

formal, or de jure; these have been reviewed by a group of experts and endorsed by a stan-
dards body. Other standards are informal, or de facto; they have been widely adopted
without having been formally reviewed. The Internet standards, such as TCP/IP, are de facto
standards, whereas Ethernet standards (IEEE 802.3) are de jure standards.
Among the agencies that work on data communications standards are the Internet Society
(ISOC), the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
The Internet Society (ISOC)
ISOC seeks to formalize standards to facilitate the development of compatible technologies.
It was formed in 1992 with a mission “to assure the open development, evolution, and use
of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world.”2 ISOC is an organiza-
tional umbrella under which a number of other organizations operate:
●
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
●
Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)
●
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)
●
Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
Originally part of the ISOC, IANA is responsible for the coordination of domain names,
IP addresses and protocols, and port assignments. In recent years, IANA was transferred to
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), an international non-
profit organization set up by the ISOC. It is closely monitored by the U.S. government and
ICANN to ensure that no inappropriate activities occur.
American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) seeks to reinforce the position of U.S.
government and industry while helping ensure the health and safety of consumers and pro-
tecting the environment. ANSI supervises the creation and use of thousands of standards
and directives that directly affect companies and government agencies in almost every sec-
tor of the economy. It is also actively committed to accrediting programs that evaluate
conformity to those standards.3
International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
ITU is the United Nations’ principal agency for communication and information technolo-
gies. Acting as a focus for government interests and the private sector, ITU serves to help
the world communicate in three critical sectors: radio communication, calibration, and devel-
opment. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and its membership includes 191 member states
and more than 700 member organizations and associations.4

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
A nonprofit organization, IEEE is the world’s principal trade association for the advancement
of technology. It is active in many industrial sectors, including computers and telecommuni-
cations, electric power, and electronics. Its members count on IEEE as an impartial source of
information, resources, and engineering for both organizations and individual professionals.
To stimulate an interest in the technology profession, IEEE is also active among university
students around the world.
IEEE has:
●
More than 400,000 total members (including more than 100,000 student members)
●
333 sections divided into 10 geographical areas
●
2,081 chapters that link the local members who have similar technical interests
●
Over 1,855 student organizations at universities in 80 countries
●
533 student branch chapters of IEEE technical societies5
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
TIA is a partnership among information, communications, and entertainment companies. It is
active in the development of standards and has a role in the development of both domestic
and international policy.6 Standards for data communications are commonly published as
dual standards with the Electronics Industry Association (EIA)—for example, the standards
for wiring specifications (such as EIA/TIA T568A and T568B) in communications jacks
(e.g., RJ-11s for telephones and RJ-45s for data cables).
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
ISO is the global leader in developing and publishing international standards. The organiza-
tion’s initials are derived from its French title. It is a network of national standards bodies
from 157 countries, with one member body per country. ISO is organized around a Central
Secretariat based in Geneva, Switzerland, which coordinates activities across the system. It is
a nongovernmental organization that bridges the gap between the public and private sectors.
Many of its member institutes are governmental structures in their own countries, whereas
others have their roots in the private economy. Therefore, ISO often represents a consensus
for solutions that meet the requirements of business and the broader needs of society.7
OSI Reference Model
In 1978, ISO developed a layered model of networking that became known as the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model. This model rapidly became the dominant
method for illustrating the functions of a network protocol in academic and industry
environments. Developed jointly with the International Telecommunications Standardiza-
tion Sector of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T), the project was to
develop a vendor-neutral, nonproprietary set of network standards in an effort to establish
a method of creating components for networking that would facilitate communications
through common protocols, but it was quickly eclipsed by the rising popularity of the
TCP/IP protocol stack of the Internet’s predecessors, like the MILNET and BITNET.

The OSI Reference Model broke down the complex process of communications into seven dis-
tinct layers, each with specific functions and protocols. Whereas the protocols themselves
became obsolete, the reference model layers are widely accepted as a common methodology
for communications instruction. Figure 2-9 provides an overview of the OSI Reference Model
layers and functions. Each layer is discussed in additional detail in the following sections.
As shown in Figure 2-10, the premise of the OSI Reference Model is that information created by
the user or client is translated and encoded through the various layers, from the top level at the
Application layer to the bottom level at the Physical layer, where it is transmitted across a net-
work, to a receiver, where it is broken down by the receiver’s protocol stack in reverse order.
Each layer provides a header with specific information on the function of that layer, then passes
the data and header to the next-lower level, where it becomes the data payload for that layer.

Physical Layer
At the Physical layer, the primary function is to place the transmission signal carrying the
message onto the communications media—in other words, put “bits on a wire.” The following
sections describe the primary functions and services.
Establishing and Terminating the Physical and Logical Connection to
the Media The physical standards and specifications are too various to discuss in this
chapter. However, there are several common to networking, including cabling and connec-
tor standards. As mentioned earlier, media can be divided into two categories: guided media
(including wire and cables) and unguided media (including wireless and microwave radio and
infrared). The dominant media types and standards will be examined here.
Twisted Pair Wire Twisted pair wire consists of a number of colored wires twisted
together to minimize the effect of external noise on the carried signal. There used to be two
types of twisted pair wire in use: shielded twisted pair wire (STP) and unshielded twisted
pair wire (UTP). STP was used primarily for token ring networks (discussed in the Data
Link layer section) and is seldom seen in modern implementations. UTP cable is now the
most common alternative, given that it is inexpensive, easy to work with, and physically
small compared to other options. With no shielding, the twisting would only provide mini-
mal protection, so the cable has a maximum effective limit of approximately 100 yards.
(Note that this distance is between end nodes—i.e., a computer and the switch, not the length
of cable between the computer and the wall outlet.)
As shown in Figure 2-11, the color coding follows a standard—TIA 568 A/B—issued by the
Telecommunications Industry Association (an offshoot of the Electronics Industry Associa-
tion) and is used to ensure that both ends of the cable are connected correctly between
the endpoints. (The B standard, published in 2001, renders the A standard obsolete.) The jacks
and ports used for these cables are part of a standard known as Radio Jack (RJ) 45 series.
The type of UTP cable used is rated by category. The categories currently listed include:
●
Cat 1—Not a formal standard recognized by TIA/EIA; previously used for POTS
telephone communications, ISDN, and doorbell wiring
●
Cat 2—Not a formal standard recognized by TIA/EIA; previously was frequently
used on 4-Mbps token ring networks
●
Cat 3—Currently defined in TIA/EIA-568-B; used for data networks using frequencies
up to 16 MHz; traditionally popular for 10-Mbps Ethernet networks
●
Cat 4—Currently unrecognized by TIA/EIA; provided performance of up to 20 MHz
and was frequently used on 16-Mbps token ring networks
●
Cat 5—Currently unrecognized by TIA/EIA; provided performance of up to 100 MHz
and was frequently used on 100-Mbps Ethernet networks; may be unsuitable for
1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet networks
●
Cat 5e—Currently defined in TIA/EIA-568-B; provides performance of up to 100 MHz
and is frequently used for both 100-Mbps and Gigabit Ethernet networks
●
Cat 6—Currently defined in TIA/EIA-568-B; provides performance of up to 250 MHz,

Coaxial Cable Coaxial cable consists of a solid core of copper surrounded by an insulating
material surrounded by a mesh of conducting copper fibers, all of which is embedded in
another insulating material like foil. Finally, the entire cable has a protective cover around
it. Coaxial cable was one of the first local area networking cable types.
As shown in Figure 2-12, the primary purpose of the outer conductor is to absorb external noise
that could interfere with the signal carried on the copper core. Coaxial cable, like fiber-optic
cable, is a channel media, which means that it can only carry one message in one direction.
A second cable is needed to return a message and complete the circuit. Some short-distance
communications have been performed using the outer conductor in implementations like high-
speed Internet over cable television installations from the home to the street connection point.
At the height of coaxial-based networks, there were two primary types of cable used: “thick-
net” (RG-8) and “thinnet” (RG-58). Thicknet used a large auxiliary unit interface (AUI) cable
connected to a “vampire tap” that connected to the large diameter cable to establish the con-
nection. Thinnet ran station to station, connecting directly to the network interface card
through a BNC connector. Today, coaxial cable is all but obsolete in data communications.
The exception is its use in the cable television infrastructure to support cable modem-based
high-speed Internet access for residences.

Fiber-Optic Cable Fiber-optic cable is a tube of glass with an ultra-pure glass core that car-
ries light waves through the length of the cable. As shown in Figure 2-13, there are a number of
variants of fiber-optic cable. The simplest is single mode, in which a single beam of light is
transmitted down the length of the cable. This provides data rates of approximately 10 Gbps
over distances of up to approximately 35 miles.
If a sender desires to send more than one signal at the same time, a multi-mode variant can
be used, such as graded-index or step-index. Typical transmission speeds for these variants
are up to 100 Mbps for up to two miles, up to 1 Gbps for approximately 500 yards, and
up to 10 Gbps for up to approximately 1/5 mile (300 yards). The two variants differ in the
method they use to “bounce” the light down the path, with step-index using changes in the
angle of transmission and graded-index modifying the wavelengths of light. Fiber-optic cable
typically uses an “ST” or “SC” type connector.
Wireless LAN When installing networks in buildings under construction, it is most benefi-
cial to use physical cable like UTP. UTP is easy to work with, reliable, not subject to inter-
ception or eavesdropping, and relatively inexpensive. However, when installing networks in
existing buildings, it becomes difficult and expensive to attempt to retrofit the facility with
physical cable. The most commonly accepted alternative is to use a wireless local area net-
work. Wireless LANS (also known as WLANs or by the brand name Wi-Fi, which stands
for “wireless fidelity”) are thought by many in the IT industry to be inherently insecure.
The communication channel between the wireless network interface of any computing
device and the access point that provides its services uses radio transmissions. Without some
form of protection, these signals can be intercepted by anyone with a wireless packet sniffer.
In order to prevent interception of these communications, these networks must use some
form of cryptographic security control.

The advantages of WLANs include:
●
Convenience—The wireless nature of such networks allows users to access network
resources from nearly any convenient location within their primary networking
environment (home or office).
●
Mobility—With the emergence of public wireless networks, users can access the
Internet even outside their normal work environment.
●
Productivity—Users connected to a wireless network can maintain a nearly constant
affiliation with their desired network as they move from place to place.
●
Deployment—Initial setup of an infrastructure-based wireless network requires little
more than a single access point.
●
Expandability—Wireless networks can serve a suddenly increased number of clients
with the existing equipment.
●
Cost—Wireless networking hardware is at worst a modest increase from wired counterparts.
The disadvantages of WLANs include:
●
Security—Wireless LAN transceivers are designed to serve computers throughout a
structure with uninterrupted service using radio frequencies. Not only can the wireless
packets be intercepted by a nearby adversary’s computer, but more importantly, a
user willing to spend a small amount of money on a good-quality antenna can pick up
packets at a remarkable distance. In fact, there are even computer users, known as
wardrivers, who are dedicated to locating and sometimes cracking into wireless
networks.

●
Range—The typical range of a common wireless network with standard equipment
is on the order of tens of meters. Though sufficient for a typical home, it will be
insufficient in a larger structure.
●
Reliability—Like any radio frequency transmission, wireless networking signals are
subject to a wide variety of interference as well as complex propagation effects that
are beyond the control of the network administrator.
●
Speed—The speed on most wireless networks (typically, 1 to 108 Mbps) is reasonably
slow compared to the slowest common wired networks (100 Mbps up to several Gbps).
Wireless networks use wireless network interface cards to connect to an access control
point (or AP). The AP provides the connection between the wireless network and the phys-
ical network. WLANs are organized into one of three architectures: peer to peer (P2P),
basic service set (BSS), or extended service set (ESS). As shown in Figure 2-14, a P2P
WLAN works much like its wired counterpart, with one client serving as the coordinating
point for wireless access. All other clients connect by communicating with this coordinat-
ing client. A BSS works much like a true LAN, with a central AP serving as the hub or
switch and with all the clients connecting through it. An extended service set is a collection
of connected APs that allows the client to roam between BSSs much as a cellular phone
customer can roam throughout a geographic region without being disconnected.
Bluetooth Bluetooth is now the de facto industry standard for short range wireless com-
munications between devices. It is used to establish communications links between wireless
telephones and headsets, between PDAs and desktop computers, and between laptops. It
was established by scientists from the telecommunications company Ericsson, and soon they

invited Intel, Nokia, IBM, and Toshiba to participate. Microsoft, Lucent Technologies, and
3Com joined the Bluetooth Special Interest Group shortly after its inception in order to sup-
port the new standard and technology.
The Bluetooth wireless communications link can be exploited by anyone within an approxi-
mately 30-foot range unless suitable security controls have been implemented. It has been
estimated that there will be almost a billion Bluetooth-enabled devices by the end of the
decade. In discoverable mode, devices can easily be discovered and accessed, much as a
shared folder can on a networked computer. Even in nondiscoverable mode, the device is sus-
ceptible to access by other devices that have connected with it in the past.8
Infrared Yet another variant is infrared wireless networks, which are currently not as pop-
ular as 802.11 or Bluetooth-based networks. At one time, there was a movement toward the
use of Infrared Data connections between personal devices such as personal digital assistants
(PDAs) and laptops. The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) defined several standards for use
in short-range (typically less than 1 meter) infrared connections. This worked well for syn-
chronizing personal computing equipment but was considered ineffective for networking
because of its data rate (2.4 Kbps to 16 Mbps) and its line-of-sight requirement. Older infra-
red (IR) LANs mounted central APs in the ceiling as a networking option, but these were
quickly replaced with 802.11 alternatives.
Physical Layer Networking Devices At the Physical layer, a hub is a device that pro-
vides a physical connection between a system and a network. Although advances in network-
ing technology have blurred the lines between hubs, switches, and even routers, the simplest
connection is that of the hub. It works by accepting a transmission on the outbound wire or
sets of wires connecting the computer to the network, then retransmitting it on all inbound con-
nections (from the hub to other clients or network connections). Hubs were initially called con-
centrators because they concentrated the network connections for each network segment.
Hubs do little in the way of treating transmissions other than rebroadcasting them. Analog
hubs (known as amplifiers) simply take incoming analog signals and retransmit them. Signals
suffering from attenuation (drop in signal strength) are increased in amplitude (made louder
or stronger) and rebroadcast. Unfortunately, weak signals with weak noise become strong
signals with strong noise when amplified. Digital hubs (repeaters) recreate the digital bit
stream from the incoming connection and thus virtually eliminate noise. However, in many
cases, even hubs can only retransmit a few times before issues arise. In the early days of
10-Mbps Ethernet (described in the Data Link Section), networks were subject to the 3-4-5
rule: no more than three populated segments, connected by four repeater hops, with five total
segments. This rule proved to be invalid with the advent of Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps).
Physical Layer Security The primary focus of security at the Physical layer is the pro-
tection of the medium against unauthorized interception. Eavesdropping typically occurs
through unauthorized access to connection devices like hubs, in which the attacker uses spe-
cial software, called a packet sniffer, to capture and view the packets transmitted across the
device. The problem is worst with wireless communications because of the pervasive nature
of the transmissions. Fiber-optic cable is naturally resistant to eavesdropping given that it is
less susceptible to physical interception. Although an attacker could tap into a wire connec-
tion such as UTP or Coax, the glass fibers that form the cable resist a physical interception.

However, the connection points are just as susceptible to interception and capture or rebroad-
casting to unauthorized stations.
Data Link Layer
The Data Link layer (DLL) is the primary layer for networking support. It is referred to as
the first “subnet” layer given that it provides the addressing, packetizing, media access con-
trol, error control, and some flow control for networks. In LANs, it is the primary level
responsible for client-to-client and client-to-server communications. The DLL is further
divided into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access
Control (MAC) sublayer. The LLC sublayer is primarily designed to support the multiplexing
and demultiplexing protocols transmitted over the MAC sublayer. It also provides flow con-
trol and error detection and retransmission. The MAC sublayer is designed to manage access
to the communications media—in other words, regulates which clients are allowed to trans-
mit and when. The MAC sublayer and other functions of the DLL are further discussed in
later sections.
DLL Protocols There are a number of protocols available for DLL support; however, the
dominant protocols for local area networking are Ethernet (for wired networks) and Wire-
less Ethernet or Wi-Fi (for wireless networks). Other DLL LAN protocols include token
ring, FDDI, PPP, PPTP, and L2TP. For WANs, Asynchronous Transfer Mode and Frame
Relay are the dominant protocols.
Ethernet Standardized as IEEE Standard 802.3, Ethernet was originally developed by
Xerox PARC in the mid-1970s. However, the developers failed to gain support for the proto-
col at Xerox. Eventually, Robert Metcalfe left Xerox and formed 3Com. He convinced Digi-
tal Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox to work collaboratively to further
develop the protocol, resulting in the original DIX Ethernet standard. In 1983, Ethernet was
modified and adopted as IEEE 802.3. Original versions of 802.3 Ethernet worked at 10 Mbps
over coaxial cable and UTP. In fact, the descriptors for Ethernet included information on its
DLL protocol as well as physical media, as shown in Table 2-1. Most UTP installations have
limits of 100 meters for the cables from the client to a powered repeater or switch.
For its MAC sublayer, Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
(CSMA/CD) for its wired protocols and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Avoidance (CSMA/CA) for its wireless protocols. These are described in a later section.
Wireless Ethernet The standard for wireless networks falls under IEEE 802.11 – Wireless
Local Area Networks (WLAN). Currently, there are four standards (and a host of legacy sys-
tems) operating: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. Although 802.11a was the first
formal standard, it was hampered in development by regulation; as a result, 802.11b became
the first widely accepted standard. Most modern equipment is downwardly compatible,
meaning a device designed to work in the 802.11g range will work on a lower-level network.
Table 2-2 provides an overview of available and planned WLAN standards.
Token Ring Ratified as IEEE Standard 802.5, IBM’s Token Passing ring network used a
logical ring topology and required stations to possess a token—essentially a data frame with

no data—prior to being allowed to transmit data. In the logical ring, which could be implemen-
ted in a physical star with a standard hub (referred to as a multistation access unit, or MAU)
connected to clients with UTP, the token travels to and from each workstation in turn. Because
of the relatively cheap cost of Ethernet (originally referred to informally as cheapnet), token ring
lost the market battle in spite of IBM’s best marketing efforts.

Fiber Distributed Data Interface Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) was a stan-
dard similar to token ring that used two counterdirectional fiber-optic loops to provide net-
work connections over large areas—up to about 120 miles. Similar to token ring, the MAC
used by FDDI was based on a token and was referred to as token bus (from the IEEE 802.4
token bus protocol). This protocol allowed multiple stations to transmit by adding their
packets onto the token, whether it already contained data or not. FDDI’s advantage lay in
its resiliency; even if the loop was severed, stations could still transmit using one loop to
transmit to stations in one direction and the other for the opposite direction. Stations were
natively attached to one or both loops, depending on their priority, and were thus known as
single attached stations (SAS) or dual attached stations (DAS). The development of Fast
Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet and their relatively inexpensive implementations has made
FDDI virtually obsolete.
Asynchronous Transfer Mode Asynchornous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a WAN packet-
switching DLL protocol that uses fixed cell (frame) sizes of 53 bytes (48 bytes of data and
5 bytes of header information). Also known as Cell Relay, ATM is different from other proto-
cols in that it is a connection-oriented DLL protocol rather than connectionless, like Ethernet.
ATM provides support for virtual channels and virtual paths to expedite packet transmission.
A virtual channel indicates that each cell has a similar identifier (VCI) guiding the cell through
the network. The virtual channels may also share a common identifier, indicating a virtual
path (VPI). A virtual path is a grouping of virtual channels with common endpoints. A virtual
path may be established between two locations, with the channels representing communica-
tions between systems at those locations.
ATM can even be implemented in a LAN through a process of LAN emulation (LANE).
There are still many ATM implementations in operation, given that its original 155 Mbps
data rate has been upgraded to multi-gigabit speed. However, the current development of
multi-gigabit Ethernet and the low costs associated with Ethernet networks threaten ATM’s
future.
Frame Relay Frame relay is another WAN protocol used to encapsulate voice and data
transmitted between LANs. Unlike ATM, frame relay uses flexible-length frames and leaves
error checking to the endpoints. Like ATM, frame relay uses virtual circuits for long distance
point-to-point data delivery. Similar to ATM, developments in Gigabit Ethernet also threaten
the future of frame relay.
PPP, PPTP, and L2TP This final set of DLL protocols is used most commonly for com-
puter communications over dial-up telephone networks. Prior to the development of high-
speed Internet access through cable modems, residential and most commercial connections
to the Internet were made through modems. Protocols like the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
are used to make the connection from the client’s system through a modem. DSL still uses
PPP in its communication process, multiplexing the data signal with the home voice channel.
PPP has replaced older protocols like the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), which had poor
error-handling procedures. PPP over Ethernet is the most common implementation today,
although PPP over ATM is also used.

Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) are other
protocols used for remote access and tunneling PPP packets over an IP network. Instead of
communicating over modems for dial-up networking, the PPP packets are encapsulated
using PPTP or L2TP and sent over an IP network. In order to secure communications over
PPTP or L2TP, other encryption protocols, such as IPSec or EAP-TLS, must be used.
Packet Framing The first responsibility of the DLL is to convert the network layer
packet into a DLL frame. Unlike higher levels, the DLL adds not only a header component
but also a trailer. When necessary, the packet is fragmented into one or more frames, with
corresponding information embedded into the frame header. As shown in Figure 2-15, the
Ethernet II frame includes a preamble. The preamble is a series of bits (010101010) used to
indicate the start of a frame, an SFD, the destination MAC address, the source MAC address,
a specification of the type of Ethernet being used, the data payload, and the frame check
sequence, which is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check used in detecting errors in the frame.
Addressing Networking addressing at the DLL is accomplished by a number embedded
in the network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer. This number, known as the
MAC address, Ethernet Hardware Address, or simply hardware address, uniquely identi-
fies the client system and, through the address resolution protocol, allows packets to be
delivered to an endpoint. This 48-bit number is commonly denoted in hexadecimal format
(e.g., 00-00-A3-6A-B2-1A). The first three octets (or hex sets) are assigned by IEEE as part of
their organizationally unique identifier, or Company_id. The database of these addresses can
be viewed at http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/public.html. Recent updates in MAC
addresses allow the last octets to be assigned by the organization, overriding the burned-in
addresses.
Media Access Control One of the primary functions of the DLL is the control of traf-
fic flow—which station is allowed to transmit when. There are two general approaches to
this task: deterministic (or control) and contention (or stochastic). Contention approaches
such as CSMA/CA and CSMA/CD work on a first-come, first-served basis, whereas control
approaches regulate flow, specifying requirements the client must follow before transmitting,
as in the case of a token or central station permission.
Deterministic Approach With the deterministic approach, a “predetermined” or “con-
trolled” method of allowing clients to transmit data is used. There are a number of ways this can
be implemented. The first is a controlled network, in which the client must request permission to
transmit. In roll-call polling, the central control unit, usually a server, polls each client to deter-
mine if it has traffic to transmit. If it does, it is allowed to send that data. If not, the next client on
the list is contacted. In go-ahead polling, the first client on the list transmits data if it needs to; if
it doesn’t, it notifies the next client that it may transmit data if needed. Token passing rings
and busses work on this principle, using the token as the control mechanism. Control

approaches are superior in that they maintain a well-regulated network, in which traffic is
transmitted in an orderly fashion, with an optimal data rate. They also facilitate a priority
system, in that priority clients or servers can be polled more frequently than others. Token-
based systems can also incorporate a priority set of bits that allows assignment of different
classes, to facilitate the transmission of important and time-sensitive data, such as video.
Contention Approach The other dominant media access control method allows a first-
come, first-served approach. With the contention approach, whenever a station needs to transmit
data, it simply listens to determine if the network is currently being used, as when another client is
transmitting data. If the channel is free, the station transmits. The downside to this approach is
that more than one station may attempt to transmit at the same time. Thus, the contention
approach must have mechanisms to deal with this event, which is referred to as a collision.
Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) is the dominant contention mechanism. Based on the
Aloha Protocols, a set of communications protocols used in a radio-based data network in
Hawaii, CSMA means that each station listens to the media (Carrier Sense) and all stations
have equal access (Multiple Access). Two variants of CSMA are CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA.
With CSMA, systems are set up so that if a collision is detected, both stations immediately
emit a jamming signal to warn all other clients that a collision has occurred and must be
resolved. How do clients know a collision has occurred? A client transmitting a specific volt-
age level on a wire will receive a voltage spike when more voltage is detected than is being
transmitted. When these stations recognize a collision, they begin the Binary Exponential
Backoff Algorithm. Beginning with 1 bit that has two values (0 or 1), each client randomly
selects a value and waits that amount of time in milliseconds, then attempts to retransmit. If
the two clients choose the same value, another collision is detected and the two stations move
to 2 bits (four values) and try again. The clients continue until they are able to transmit or
they reach 16 bits, at which time they give up and send an error message to their systems.
Collision avoidance differs from collision detection in that, before a client transmits, it sends
a short “intent to transmit” message warning other clients not to transmit. The client then
waits a short time to ensure that the channel is clear, then transmits its message, and waits
for acknowledgement of receipt.
Networking Devices at the Data Link Layer To connect networks at the DDL,
specific technologies are employed. Although the hub connects networks at the Physical layer,
that results in one large network. However, connecting networks with a Layer 2 switch main-
tains separate collision domains, given that this device is capable of bridging. Bridging is the
process of connecting networks with the same DLL protocols (e.g., Ethernet) while maintaining
the integrity of each network and only passing messages that need to be transmitted between
the two. Bridges, which are no longer used, were specialized network equipment that connected
multiple networks. They were capable of router-type operations in building bridging tables,
tracking which clients were on which network. When moving frames between networks
(referred to as filtering or forwarding), the bridge would hear a message transmitted for a
specific destination client; if that client didn’t respond, the bridge would forward the
retransmitted message to its other network(s) to determine where that client resided. If a
response was detected, the response was forwarded back to the original sender, and the
bridge would update its table. That’s why these devices became known as learning bridges.
Bridges were replaced with Layer 2 switches, which perform the same tasks but can connect
more than two networks.

From a security standpoint, switches increased the relative protection of networking communi-
cations. By creating a point-to-point connection between two stations, the switch prevents
other nodes from eavesdropping on the digital conversation. This prevents the average user
from running a packet sniffer program and listening in on a coworker’s data communications.
From a network administration standpoint, where using a packet sniffer is not only legal but
advisable (to detect anomalous network performance), most switches have a monitoring port,
which operates in “promiscuous mode” and allows the administrator to review all networking
traffic.
Network Layer
The Network layer is the primary layer for communications between networks. This layer
has three key functions: packetizing, addressing, and routing.
Packetizing The Network layer takes the segments handed down from the Transport
layer and organizes them into one or more packets for transmission across a network. Each
packet (also called a datagram) consists of two parts: the header and the data. The header
contains information that is normally only read by computers, such as where the packet is
coming from and its destination. The data is the part that end users actually see—for exam-
ple, the body of an e-mail message or a Web page.
Understanding exactly what goes in a packet header is important because it can help you con-
figure packet filters against possible attacks. Some firewall programs can give you a glimpse of
the contents of a packet. To find out more about headers and their contents, go to the original
Internet Protocol specification at www.ietf.org, click RFC Pages, and search for RFC 791.
An IP packet header is commonly illustrated according to the layers of information within it,
as shown in Figure 2-16, which contains the following packet elements:
●
Version—Identifies the version of IP that was used to generate the packet. As of early
2008, TCP/IP version 4 is still in common use. However, some larger organizations
and ISPs have begun to deploy IPv6 on their internal networks.
●
Internet header length—Describes the length of the header in 32-bit words and is a
4-bit value. The default value is 20.
●
Type of service—Indicates which of four service options is used to transmit the
packet: minimize delay, maximize throughput, maximize reliability, and minimize
cost. However, this field is of limited value because most IP network setups don’t
enable an application to set this value.
●
Total length—This 16-bit field gives the total length of the packet, to a maximum of
165,535 bytes.
●
Identification—This 16-bit value aids in the division of the data stream into packets of
information. The receiving computer (possibly a firewall) uses each packet’s identifi-
cation number to reassemble, in the correct order, the packets that make up the data
stream.
●
Flags—This 3-bit value tells whether this packet is a fragment of a whole packet and,
more specifically, whether it’s the last fragment or more fragments are to follow.
●
Fragment offset—If the data received is a fragment, this value indicates where the
fragment belongs in the sequence of fragments so that a packet can be reassembled.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

●
Time to live (TTL)—This 8-bit value identifies the maximum time the packet can
remain in the system before it is dropped. Each router or device through which the
packet passes reduces the TTL by a value of one. Having a TTL prevents a packet
from getting caught in loops because it is undeliverable. When the value reaches
zero, the packet is destroyed and an ICMP message is transmitted to the sender.
●
Protocol—Identifies the IP protocol that was used in the data portion of the packet
and should receive the data at its destination (e.g., TCP, UDP, or ICMP).
●
Header checksum—A summing up of all the 16-bit values in the packet header in a
single value.
●
Source address—The address of the computer or device that sent the packet.
●
Destination address—The address of the computer or device that is to receive the
packet.
●
Options—This element can contain a Security field, which enables the sender to assign
a classification level to the packet (such as Secret, Top Secret, and so on), as well as
several source routing fields by which the sender can supply routing information that
gateways can use to send the packet to its destination.
●
Data—The part that the end user actually sees, such as the body of an e-mail
message.

Addressing The Network layer also assigns a Network layer address to uniquely identify
a destination across multiple networks. A typical address consists of two components: the
network identification, or netid, component and the host identification, or hostid, compo-
nent, as shown in Figure 2-17. Note that the dotted decimal notation most commonly used
(e.g., 192.168.2.118) is translated into binary for network use. In TCP/IP, the IP address is
the Network layer address.
As shown in Figure 2-17, the IP address contains a source and destination IP address along
with additional information on the packet.
Addresses are maintained by the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA) and issued on an
as-needed basis (see Table 2-3). In the early years of the Internet, these addresses were handed
out in blocks or classes, as follows:
●
Class A—A Class A address consists of a primary octet providing the netid and then three
octets providing the hostid. This allows an organization to configure up to 16,777,214
hosts on its network. In practice, the final octet of an address cannot be 0 or 255. The
eight binary 0s are used to represent the network address, and eight binary 1s are used
to represent a broadcast address.
●
Class B—A Class B address consists of two octets providing the netid and two octets
providing 65534 hostids.
●
Class C—A Class C address consists of three octets providing the netid and one octet
providing 254 hostids.
●
Class D and Class E addresses are reserved.
Unfortunately, this assignment has proven very inefficient. For example, a university might be
issued a Class B address but have, at its peak, only 4,000–5,000 devices that need a network
address. This means that 61,000 or more addresses are not used.
In 1993, a stop-gap measure was implemented by the IANA to slow the adoption of class-based
addresses. Known as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), this measure replaced the

traditional class-based assignment system with a method that assigns only the addresses that an
organization actually needs. Instead of defaulting to octet-based assignment, as was the case
with the class-based system, CIDR issues addresses to organizations based on a binary method.
Thus, an organization could be issued just the number of addresses it needs rather than the
usual grouping size of addresses used in the class-based address scheme. CIDR notation desig-
nates this assignment as 192.168.2.0/30, where the /30 indicates the number of digits that are
assigned as network address (versus host address) and the remaining digits indicate the number
of host addresses available to the organization. With 30 of 32 bits dedicated to the network ID,
only two bits remain for the host ID, resulting in four available host addresses: 00, 01, 10, and
11. A /24 is essentially a Class C address; however, organizations are no longer under con-
straints to be issued addresses in the class system.
The dwindling pool of addresses is one of the reasons the Internet is moving to IPv6, a new ver-
sion of IP, which uses a 128-bit address instead of a 32-bit address. This substantially increases
the number of available addresses (2128). Because of the length of the IPv6 addresses, they are
commonly expressed in hexadecimal format (e.g., 12a4:011c:0003:ba37:0000:0000:0000:1922)
rather than dotted decimal notation. Two rules guide the notation of IPv6:
1.
Leading zeros can be skipped within each octet (thus, the address above can be short-
ened to 12a4:11c:3:ba37:0:0:0:1922).
2.
Consecutive zeros can be replaced with double colons (thus, the address above can be
further shortened to 12a4:11c:3:ba37::1922).
IPv6 uses CIDR assignment rather than a new version of class-based assignment. Even though
IPv6 has been around since 1981, it is deployed on only an estimated one percent of world
networks.
Dynamic Addressing Until IPv6 adoption is complete, many organizations are using other
methods to manage their limited addresses—for example, dynamic addressing. Dynamic addres-
sing assigns a pool of addresses to an address assignment server, using a protocol like Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). When a computer system starts up or “boots,” it requests
and receives an address and critical network configuration information, including the gateway
address and the address of Domain Name Service servers. The advantage of this method is that
a large group of systems may require only a smaller number of addresses. When a system shuts
down, it returns the address to the pool, where it can be used by another system.

Network Address Translation In addition to CIDR, another mechanism supported
at the Network layer that assists in the management of addresses is Network Address
Translation (NAT). NAT uses a device like a router to segregate the external Internet from an
internal intranet or network. The device is provided with the addresses assigned to the orga-
nization. It maps these addresses to different addresses inside the intranet. This provides
security but can also maximize network address assignment when combined with Port Address
Translation, as described in the Transport layer section. The internal addresses could be any address;
however, there are IP addresses reserved for private (nonroutable) networking. These include:
●
10.0.0.0—For those needing a Class A range
●
172.16.0.0–172.31.0.0—For those needing multiple Class B ranges
●
192.168.0.0—For those needing a single Class B range (the most commonly implemented
range)
Subnetting Organizations are commonly assigned wider address pools than they need. Or,
to keep things simple, they may want to divide their assigned addresses into logical network
groups, such as LANs located in different buildings or on different floors of a building. In
these cases, an organization may wish to subnet its addresses. Subnetting is the process of
internally dividing a block of addresses into smaller logical groups for ease of organization.
When configuring a system to be on a network, the administrator will specify a subnet
mask, which is a notation that tells the network what parts of the address are subnet and
what parts are host. Subnet masks are commonly presented in dotted decimal notation but are
also commonly presented in CIDR notation—for example, 255.255.255.0/24, in which the 255
block indicates a network address, regardless of the size of the network address block assigned
to the organization. By manipulating the subnet component (see Figure 2-16), the organization
can increase or decrease the number of subnets or hosts per subnet that it manages.
Routing Routing is the process of moving a Network layer packet across multiple net-
works. The devices that connect multiple networks are called routers. Routers work at the
Network layer to receive packets and direct them toward their ultimate destinations. The
transmission links between routers work at the Data Link layer. In other words, the router
has one or more types of Data Link layer protocols represented by an interface or network
card. A router could have different types of data link protocols, as it receives the frame car-
rying the Network layer packet, and creates a new frame once it determines the outbound
interface that represents the direction the packet needs to go. Routers accomplish this
through the use of router tables. A router table is a text entry that contains information on
destination addresses, outbound interfaces toward those addresses, and additional informa-
tion on the status of the host or network.
There are a number of routing protocol categories. Static routing requires an administrator to
manually enter the routing table information, whereas dynamic routing is done by the router
itself. Routers do this by transmitting their router tables to their neighbors and updating their
own tables with the information they received.
Internal Routing Protocols Internal routing protocols are used inside an autonomous
system (AS). An AS is a system owned or managed by a single entity and generally consist-
ing of analogous technologies. The two dominant internal routing protocol methods are

distance-vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols. Distance-vector protocols
base their routing decisions on a simple determination of the number of hops between the
router and the destination. A hop is one connection from router to router. The two dominant
distance-vector protocols are the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Interior Gate-
way Routing Protocol (IGRP). RIP is more widely used, although implementations are rapidly
being replaced by link-state protocols. RIP routers originally transmitted their entire router
tables every 30 seconds, resulting in a significant amount of network traffic. In order to manage
the table sizes, RIP tables have a maximum hop count of 15. RIP has evolved through versions
1, 2, and next generation (ng).
Link-state protocols contain information about not only the distance to the destination but
the states of the links, including traffic, throughput, and other components. The dominant
link-state routing protocols are Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to
Intermediate System (IS-IS). OSPF is superior to RIP in that the entire router table is not
transmitted, only information on the immediate neighbor routers. OSPF can also track and
store information on the time to transmit and receive an update. Each neighbor router
receives this information and then updates its table with that information, providing informa-
tion on network traffic delays as calculating hop counts. OSPF also doesn’t broadcast routing
information on a regular basis; instead, it sends routing updates to select devices.
External Gateway Routing Protocols External routing protocols are used to communi-
cate between autonomous systems (AS). These provide translation between the possibly dif-
ferent internal routing protocols. The dominant external routing protocols are the Exterior
Gateway Protocol (EGP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). EGP is the older, now
obsolescent Internet routing protocol developed in 1982. The replacement, BGP, is now the
dominant protocol for the Internet; it is now in version 4. When used as an Internal Gateway
Protocol, it is referred to as IBGP; when used externally, it is referred to as EBGP.
Network Layer Security The security issues associated with the Network layer focus on
the addresses and routing of these addresses. Many of the attacks discussed in Chapter 1, such
as man-in-the-middle attacks and address spoofing, are targeted at the Internet Protocol, which
is the dominant Network layer protocol. Other risks include packet storms (a form of denial-
of-service attack), address conflicts, address redirects (in which packets aimed at one destination
are redirected to a different location), and replay attacks (in which legitimate traffic is dupli-
cated or delayed, possibly as part of one of the other attacks mentioned here).
Other security issues address other protocols used at this level, such as the Internet Control
Message Protocol (ICMP), a simple tool for relaying messages between systems. Ping sweeps
and port scanners, among other attacks, use ICMP to carry their queries to determine if sys-
tems are operational and, if so, what services are available. This information can facilitate a
more directed attack. By disabling or limiting the use of this protocol, an administrator can
greatly reduce the protocol implementation’s susceptibility to attack.
Transport Layer
The primary function of the Transport layer is to provide reliable end-to-end transfer of data
between user applications. Although the lower layers focus on networking and connectivity,
the upper layers, beginning with the Transport layer, focus on application-specific services.
The Transport layer can also provide support for a virtual circuit, a technique that allows for

higher-level communications to occur without the overhead of packet reassembly. This type
of communication is an example of a connection-oriented model. In a connection-oriented
model, a connection is established between two points, and all communications occur over
that dedicated end-to-end connection. Using a virtual circuit, each segment of the route has
a path as well as a destination embedded into the packet, ensuring that the traffic will follow
the predesigned path, without the overhead of establishing an actual connection. In a connec-
tionless protocol, individual packets are transmitted separately, without prior negotiation,
each with its own addressing information. These individual packets may take different
paths, but they all end up at the same destination, where they are reassembled into the cor-
rect order. The Transport layer is also responsible for end-to-end error and flow control.
Error Control Error control is the process of handling problems with the transfer pro-
cess, which result in modified or corrupted segments. Error control is broken into two com-
ponents: error detection and error correction. Errors typically take one of two formats. A
single-bit error only affects a single bit—typically, a 1 changing to a 0 or vice versa. Single-
bit errors are easily detected. Multiple-bit errors are more complex in that they affect more
than 1 bit, even bits in more than one location in the segment. Bit errors are most likely the
result of noise interference and are detected through one of the following schemes:
●
Repetition schemes—Repeating blocks of data a predetermined number of times.
If an error doesn’t affect each block, it may be detected. This overly simplistic method
is inefficient, however, and only catches basic errors.
●
Parity schemes—Including additional bits at the end of each byte of data. These
additional “check bits” provide a measure of error detection. With odd parity, the
sum of the values is expected to be odd. If it is odd, a 0 is added to the block; if not,
a 1 is added, making the block sum odd. Similarly, with even parity, the check bits
are added to make the sum even.
●
Redundancy schemes—Calculating parities for blocks of data rather than for an
individual byte. Longitudinal redundancy checking (LRC) examines a long row of
blocks, then adds a byte of parity for the row. It is often used with vertical
redundancy checking (VCR), which does the same task for a column of data.
By placing the data into blocks and incorporating both LRC and VRC data, it
becomes possible to detect even multi-bit errors easily. Cyclic redundancy checking
uses a long-division computation, where the remainder becomes a block of data
included with the segment. CRCs are often 16, 32, or 64 bits long. The receiver
performs the same computation at its end, and if the remainder is different, there is
a problem with the segment, and a retransmission is requested.
●
Message authentication codes—Hash values of the entire message appended onto
the message, also known as a message authentication code. This is used for
advanced determination of errors, especially at the message level. These message
hashes can be encrypted with a sender’s private key (in public key encryption) to
provide nonrepudiation as well as message-integrity checking.
Error Correction Errors are most commonly corrected through retransmission of the dam-
aged segment. To manage the process of correcting errors, protocols are used to manage the
flow of retransmission. The dominant error correction techniques are automatic repeat requests
(or ARQs). The three most common ones are Stop-And-Wait ARQ, Go-Back-N ARQ, and

Selective Repeat ARQ. Stop-And-Wait ARQ works on a 1-datagram (or packet) premise. Each
segment transmitted must be acknowledged (ACK) by the receiver before another segment is
transmitted. This one-to-one operation is very slow and intensive. However, it is very reli-
able, in that if an error is detected the bad segment is requested for retransmission—most
commonly by reacknowledging the last good segment received. Figure 2-18 illustrates the
Stop-And-Wait ARQ.
With the Go-Back-N ARQ, a number of packets can be transmitted before an acknowledge-
ment must be received. The exact number is negotiated between the two stations, as part of
the Sliding Window Protocol described in the following section on flow control. The WIN
value (window size) determines how many segments can be transmitted. Once an acknowl-
edgement is received, additional segments are transmitted. If an error is detected, the last
good segment received before the error is acknowledged and all segments since that point
are retransmitted. Although this is somewhat wasteful, given that all the segments received
since the bad segment are discarded, it is much more efficient than Stop-And-Wait ARQ.
Figure 2-19 illustrates the Go-Back-N ARQ
With Selective Repeat ARQ, only those segments that are determined to be bad are requested
for retransmission. Thus, when a bad segment is received but followed by several good
segments, the good segments are accepted and only the bad segment is re-requested. Figure 2-20
illustrates the Selective Repeat ARQ.
Flow Control Along with the error correction schemes, the Transport layer provides for flow
control for end-to-end transfers. The purpose of flow control is to prevent a receiver from being
overwhelmed with segments, which might prevent effective processing of each received segment.
Some error correction techniques, like Stop-And-Wait ARQ, provide built-in flow control.
In other techniques, some mechanism is needed to regulate the traffic. The dominant technique
for flow control is a sliding window protocol, which provides a mechanism by which a receiver
can specify the number of segments (or number of bytes) it can receive before the sender must
wait. In TCP, this is implemented as a WIN value. A typical WIN value would be 4096 (or 4K).

because the wait for acknowledgement allows the receiver to determine if there are any pro-
blems with the received datagrams/segments. A window size is also flexible. As a receiver
gains efficiency—possibly through the reduction in the number of concurrent sessions—it
can widen a window. As the receiver gets overwhelmed with additional connection requests,
it can reduce a window’s size, slowing down each connection. Figure 2-21 illustrates a slid-
ing window protocol process.
Other Functions The Transport layer is also responsible for assigning ports—uniquely
identifying the service requested by the user. The combination of Network layer address and
port is referred to as a socket. Table 2-4 provides a list of well-known port addresses. When
users wish to establish a connection with a particular service, such as HTTP, they send a
request to the well-known port address 80 as part of their socket. This tells the receiving
server, which may have more than one type of service to provide, what specific Application
layer service is requested. The sender’s client system assigns a random port number outside
the well-known port range (i.e., above 1023) as part of its socket, so that upon return the
response can find its way to the corresponding application. This socket combination allows

users to have multiple iterations of an application (e.g., multiple Web browsers) open while
each maintains its own integrity. Similarly, it allows a home Internet user to have multiple
systems working off a single dynamic IP address. The home router performs Port Address
Translation and assigns a unique socket to each client request, along with an internal IP
address, as described in the Network layer under Network Address Translation. Thus, multi-
ple users with multiple applications all requesting external services through a common source
address are able to accurately receive responses.
Tunneling protocols also work at the Transport layer. These work with Data Link layer pro-
tocols to provide secure connections. Additional information on tunneling is provided in the
discussions of VPNs in later chapters.
Transport Layer Security Within the Transport layer, there are two great risks. The
first is handling sequence numbers. TCP segments are assigned sequential numbers to track
their sequences. By guessing these sequence numbers, attackers can hijack TCP communica-
tions and attack either endpoint. The other great risk is the port assignments given the vari-
ous services provided at higher layers. The combined Network layer address and Transport
layer port socket provides insight into the function and operation of network-available ser-
vices. Knowing the ports available allows attackers to infer the listening services or applica-
tions and thus provide the necessary intelligence to use to stage an attack. Port scanners are
commonly used to identify this information, as systems are commonly configured to respond
to requests about available services as part of normal network operations.
Session Layer
The Session layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communica-
tions sessions between two systems. It also regulates whether communications are preformed
in a simplex (one way only), half-duplex (one way at a time), or full-duplex (bidirectional)
mode. In other words, when one station wishes to request services from a server, it requests

a session, much as a person dials a telephone. The dialing, ringing, and opening conversation
(“Hello, may I speak with Mr. Smith?”) are part of the establishment of a communications
session. Then, as data is transferred, the Session layer keeps the communications connected.
Finally, once both parties have completed their transfers of information, the session is
closed. In TCP/IP, this is referred to as a half-close, because even though the client may
have completed its data transfer and is finished, the server may still have data to transmit
and, therefore, maintains the connection until it has completed.
Session Layer Security Because the most common protocol, TCP/IP, does not have an
explicit Session layer, Session layer protocols are not as common, and thus there are fewer
attacks and risks associated with it. The two most common issues at the Session layer
involve the Domain Name Service (DNS) and some implementations of Kerberos, an archi-
tecture used to provide session authentication to minimize the number of logins a user must
provide to use recourses on a network. Kerberos is discussed in more detail in later chapters.
DNS, on the other hand, is a significant system with inherent weaknesses. It is part of the
Application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack but operates much the same as the Session
layer. Most Web addresses involve a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), also known as a
domain name or simply Web address (e.g., www.course.com). In TCP/IP, this is also referred
to as an Application layer address. However, in order to route traffic to this location, the net-
work needs a Network layer address, not an Application layer address. The DNS is a cen-
tralized database with information on the local database of addresses associated with a
particular domain (e.g., course.com). It is a hierarchical structure organized by top-level
domain (.com, .org, .net, .edu, etc.) and primary domain level (e.g., course.com). The data-
base also contains information on the primary and secondary name servers responsible for
all addresses within these primary domains. Basically, looking up a domain name in DNS is a
lot like dialing 411 and asking for a phone number for a university switchboard. The 411
service converts the domain name (e.g., Kennesaw State University) to a switchboard phone
number, then finds the specific address/number the requestor seeks from that switchboard.
This system, given that it is inherently insecure, is very susceptible to interception, which is
known as DNS hijacking, DNS redirection, or session hijacking. If you have ever typed in a
Web address but ended up at a different site, you’ve been the victim of this type of attack.
Presentation Layer
The Presentation layer is responsible for data translation and encryption functions. For exam-
ple, if one system is using the standard ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) and another system is using EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Inter-
change Code), the Presentation layer performs this translation. The Presentation layer also
encapsulates the Application layer message prior to passing it down to the Transport layer.
Presentation Layer Security Like the Session layer, the Presentation layer has no
direct counterpart in the TCP/IP protocol stack and thus harbors few risks. However, some
technologies, like virtual private networks (VPNs), are encryption based and work at this
layer. Thus, most encryption-oriented attacks and risks impact the Presentation layer. The
protection of the encryption keys and endpoints becomes the primary concern at this layer.

Application Layer
At the Application layer, users are provided with a number of services they can use to exchange
information. Although the term application is used for this layer of the OSF model, we are not
necessarily dealing with communication among or between applications. Instead, we generally
refer to discrete application protocols that support those applications. In the TCP/IP protocol
suite, applications include e-mail (SMTP and POP), the World Wide Web, (HTTP and
HTTPS), and file transfer (FTP and SFTP). However, users will still need a computer pro-
gram (a generalized browser in some cases or a specific application program in other cases)
to access the features of these protocols. Table 2-5 provides a more comprehensive list of
Application layer protocols and their uses.
Protocols
Use
Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
Assists a client in obtaining a network address on startup; replaced by DHCP.
Domain Name System (DNS)
Protocol
Provides a translation between Application layer addresses or host names
(i.e., HTTP Uniform Resource Locators (URLS)) and IP addresses; serves as a
look-up resource for the Internet; also associated with the assignment of
domain names and the Internet Domain Registry.
Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP)
Used to assist a client in obtaining a network address from a central pool of
available addresses. DHCP can also provide a number of other items, such as
the subnet mask, the addresses of its gateway, and DNS servers.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Used to transfer files from a server to a client and vice versa over the Internet;
allows the user to manipulate (move, modify, and delete) these files.
HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) & Secure HTTP (HTTPS)
Used for the retrieval and display of hypertext documents over the Internet;
provides the foundation for the World Wide Web (frequently used for
internal networks as well).
Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP)
Allows clients to access their e-mail on a server; virtually all e-mail clients
support both IMAP and POP.
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Protocol
Used for near-real time chat support; allows one-to-one communications
between users.
Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP)
Used for modifying and querying directory services; these directory structures
are “trees” of entries, each with attributes that can be queried.
Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) & Secure
MIME (S-MIME)
Used for extending e-mail formats beyond basic text; allows non-text
attachments, non-ASCII character sets, and additional extensions to standard
e-mail formats.
Post Office Protocol (POP)
Like IMAP, supports the retrieval of e-mail from an e-mail server. IMAP
and POP are used by users’ client e-mail programs to view, modify and send
e-mail.
Remote Login (rlogin)
Used to remotely log onto a UNIX System.
Server Message Block (SMB)
Designed to support the sharing of files and peripherals (printers, drives,
directories, etc.) between clients on a network; most commonly associated
with Microsoft Windows systems under the name Microsoft Windows
Network.

HTTP Many protocols, like HTTP, use a two-part transfer. The first part is a request from
the client to the server that could be a request for information; this is known as a GET state-
ment, a request to upload information, a PUT statement, or other file-modification state-
ment (POST, DELETE, HEAD, etc.). The second part of the transfer is the response from
the server—that is, the delivery of the requested material. This is known as a REPLY state-
ment or some other service response.
The HTTP GET request message contains:
●
A request line—that is, GET
●
Header information—For example, specifying the language (EN) and HTTP version
●
A message body, which is optional
Here is a sample HTTP GET request, to which the server would respond with the correspond-
ing HTML files:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.course.com

Common Application Layer Protocols (continued)
Protocols
Use
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) & Extended SMTP
(ESMTP)
De facto standard that supports e-mail transfer across the Internet. Extended
SMTP improves upon the base SMTP protocol to support the use of service
extensions.
Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP)
Specifies a dictionary of predefined service queries for network systems; used
to determine network management issues. The SNMP standard includes:
●
Management Information Base (MIB)—The database of queries
●
Agents—Remote utilities to collect information for the MIB
●
Network Management Station—Or a client system that serves to collect
and present the information collected from the network systems.
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Allows user to operate a system by transmitting keyboard, video, and mouse
commands from a remote location. Users are able to see and control the
remote system as if they were sitting in front of it.
Secure Shell (SSH)
Establishes a secure channel between two systems; used heavily in electronic
commerce. SSH uses public key encryption to support the establishment of
this session.
Telnet
Older protocol used to allow connection to and control of dissimilar
systems—for example, a PC user running Windows who is accessing an
IBM mainframe running UNIX.
Trivial File Transfer Protocol
(TFTP)
Very simple protocol for FTP-like services that takes little memory and is,
therefore, useful for networking devices like switches and routers.
Whois
Used to determine the registrant (or owner) of an IP address or domain name.

HTTP works with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which embeds multiple links inside
one or more master documents. These documents do not actually have colors or graphics
embedded in them; instead, they contain links that reference the needed fonts, graphics, and
supplemental documents. Figure 2-22 shows some sample HTML code.
IMAP, POP, and SMTP There are two dominant protocols used to support retrieval of
e-mail messages from an e-mail server by client applications: IMAP and POP. POP, the Post
Office Protocol, is currently in version 3 (POP3), whereas IMAP, the Internet Message
Access Protocol, is currently in version 4 (IMAP4). Most e-mail clients allow users to select
whether or not messages are left with the server or deleted from the server as they are
retrieved. However, POP3 clients download messages to the client system and then delete
them from the server. IMAP client connections allow both online and offline (or discon-
nected) operation. Many IMAP clients will default to leave messages on the server, and
users must explicitly delete them. POP3 clients tend to operate like a mail drop; the mes-
sages exist on the server only until retrieved. When considering POP3 messages, the copy
located at the client will be considered authoritative. On the other hand, IMAP messages
are considered authoritative at the server. Client e-mail protocols are designed to pull
e-mail from a server to a client.
On the server site, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the de facto standard for transfer-
ring e-mail between post office servers across the Internet. SMTP is a text-based transfer pro-
tocol. SMTP is designed to transmit e-mail from one server to another.

FTP FTP, the File Transfer Protocol, is designed to support the transfer of files between two
computers—typically, a client and a server. According to RFC 959, the objectives of FTP are:
●
To promote sharing of files (computer programs and/or data)
●
To encourage indirect or implicit (via programs) use of remote computers
●
To shield a user from variations in file storage systems among hosts
●
To transfer data reliably and efficiently9
FTP establishes an FTP session and transfers data between a protocol interpreter (PI) and a
data transfer process (DTP). It operates in one of three modes once a session is requested:
active, passive, and extended passive. In active mode, the client actively seeks an FTP session
from a server listening on TCP port 21. Once the session is established, the server will send
data from TCP port 20. In passive mode, the server transmits its FTP information, which the cli-
ent picks up. Extended passive is similar to passive, but less server information is transmitted—in
fact, only the port number.
RPC The Application layer also involves the use of RPC, or remote procedure calls, which
allows a computer program to call for information from another program or service without
the user specifically requesting it. This “unsupervised” computer-to-computer communica-
tions can have severe security implications.
Application Layer Security Most of the applications and programs that give the net-
work and the Internet value reside at the Application layer. Therefore, this is where the larg-
est number of risks and attacks are. Each protocol has its inherent weaknesses and must be
examined, evaluated, and then implemented only if truly needed by the organization. In many
cases, there is a secure alternative to the protocols presented here. For example, instead of
using FTP, secure FTP (SFTP) could be deployed, with increased security measures and fewer
vulnerabilities. The same can be said for SHTTP and other protocols. The remainder of this
book is devoted to a number of these security issues and ways to mitigate those risks.
The Internet, WWW, and TCP/IP
The Internet is simply a network of networks; in fact, the word Internet is an abbreviation for
internetwork. The Internet today incorporates the networks of millions of small, indepen-
dent networked systems, connected by major common carriers such as AT&T, Verizon,
Global Crossing, and Sprint. Most of the services we associate with the Internet are e-mail,
the Web, FTP, and instant messaging (IM). Given that the Internet and the World Wide
Web are such vast topics, this section provides only a cursory overview of the primary pro-
tocols, TCP and IP.
By March 2011, almost 2.095 billion people were using the Internet, according to Internet
World Stats, as shown in Figure 2-23. Writing in the Harvard International Review, philoso-
pher N. J. Slabbert, a writer on policy issues for the Washington, DC–based Urban Land Insti-
tute, has asserted that the Internet is fast becoming a basic feature of global civilization, so
that what has traditionally been called “civil society” is now becoming identical with informa-
tion technology society as defined by Internet use.10

The World Wide Web
It is important to distinguish the Internet from the World Wide Web (WWW). The Internet is a
physical set of networks, whereas the WWW is a set of applications that runs on top of the
Internet. Most notably, the WWW is based on a series of hyperlinked documents that allow
the creation and retrieval of information at a number of locations using uniform resource loca-
tors or URLs. Working at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the
WWW in 1989. Since then, he has helped guide the development of many WWW standards,
including markup language like HTML and XML.
The WWW works through Web browsers (like Mozilla, Firefox or Internet Explorer)—
applications that take the requested information from the user or WWW resource and present
it by integrating text, video, graphics, and sound through hyperlinks. Figure 2-24 illustrates
how DNS is used to access a WWW document. In this illustration, a user, through a browser,
seeks to find a specific Web page. As described earlier, DNS plays a key role in finding this
information. First, the root-level WWW servers provide information on the primary name server
responsible for containing the information about the specific host containing the requested
resource, including its IP address. Next, the primary name server points the browser to the
IP address of the host, where the browser goes for the actual resource. By separating the resolution

of the primary domain from that of the secondary (and tertiary) domain, there are significantly
fewer changes that need to be made to the root servers. Any changes beyond the assignment
of the primary domain name are the responsibility of the primary (and secondary) name
server. ISPs frequently provide this service for small networks. Many organizations provide
their own primary and secondary name services. Once a browser has visited a specific site, it
can cache this information to facilitate subsequent visits.
TCP/IP
TCP/IP is a suite of protocols used by the Internet to facilitate communications. Developed
before the OSI Reference Model, it is similar in concept but differs in various details, as
shown in Figure 2-25.
The TCP/IP network model is less formal that the OSI Reference Model discussed earlier. In
fact, the TCP/IP protocol stack is a compilation of many discrete elements that work more or
less in concert to provide network services. It is sometimes useful to view these many parts
and pieces as working within a set of layers. Each layer, like those in the OSI Reference
Model, attempts to solve a group of networking problems that are involved in delivering
certain aspects of necessary network services. Also like the OSI Reference Model, each
layer provides well-defined services to the layer above it and also expects services to be
provided to it from the layer below. Higher level layers are logically closer to the user and
are more abstract, whereas lower level layers are closer to the connection where signaling
occurs and are in forms that can physically transmitted over various media channels.
Each of the four layers of the TCP/IP model is described in the following sections.
Application Layer As defined earlier, the Application layer consists of the utility proto-
cols designed to provide value to the end user. Data from the end user’s utilities (the message)
is passed down to the Transport layer for processing, as shown in Figure 2-26.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

There is a wide variety of Application layer protocols available to support use of the Inter-
net, including SMTP and POP for e-mail, FTP for data transfer, and HTTP for the transfer
of WWW content, all of which have been discussed earlier.
Transport or Host-to-Host Layer The Transport layer’s responsibilities include end-
to-end message transfer capabilities independent of the underlying network along with error
control, fragmentation, and flow control. End-to-end-message transmissions and the connec-
tion of applications at the Transport layer can be categorized as either connection-oriented
(e.g., TCP) or connectionless (e.g., UDP).
The Transport layer is literally a transport mechanism—that is, a vehicle that is responsible for
making sure its contents (passengers/goods) reach their destination safely and soundly (unless a
higher or lower layer is responsible for safe delivery). The Transport layer connects applications
through the use of ports. Because IP provides only a best-effort delivery, the Transport layer is
the first layer of the TCP/IP stack to offer reliability. Note that IP can run over a reliable data
link protocol such as the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC). Protocols above Transport,
such as RPC, can also provide reliability. For example, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol
that addresses the following reliability issues to provide a reliable byte stream:
●
Data arrives in the right order.
●
Data has minimal errors (i.e., has correctness).
●
Duplicate data is discarded.
●
Lost/discarded packets are re-sent.
●
Congestion in traffic is reduced.
A newer element of the Transport layer is Stream Control Transmissions Protocol (SCTP).
This was created to provide efficiencies for telephony but is also useful for situations that call
for connection-oriented services that are reliable. It is a stream-oriented protocol (unlike the
byte-stream-oriented nature of TCP) and multiplexes multiple streams with a single connec-
tion. It also offers redundant addressing in which an endpoint can be denoted as multiple
IP addresses, thus providing failover support without interruption.
UDP is a connectionless datagram protocol. Like IP, it is a best-effort or “unreliable” proto-
col. Reliability is addressed through error detection using a weak checksum algorithm. UDP
is typically used for applications such as streaming media (audio, video, Voice over IP, etc.),
where on-time arrival is more important than reliability, or for simple query/response applica-
tions like DNS lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is dispropor-
tionately large.
Both TCP and UDP are used to implement many applications or services. The applications at
any given network address are distinguished by their TCP or UDP port. By convention, cer-
tain well-known ports are associated with specific applications.
Internetwork or Internet Layer The Internet layer serves to move packets across
one or more networks, relying on the Link layer to get the messages up from the host sys-
tems and on the Transport layer to make sure that the traffic is correct and gets delivered
properly. For the most part, this layer is concerned with two key functions: (1) host addres-
sing and identification and (2) routing the packets across the Internet, getting data packets
from source to destination. One example of this is the X.25 protocol.

Link or Network Interface Layer The subnet layers for TCP/IP include the Data
Link layer and the Physical layer. TCP/IP relies on whatever native Network subnet layers
are present. If the user’s network is Ethernet, then the IP packets are encapsulated into
Ethernet frames. As such, TCP/IP provides no specification for the Data Link layer or
Physical layer.
Chapter Summary
■
Communication can only occur when the recipient is able to receive, process, and
comprehend the message. This one-way flow of information is referred to as a channel.
Any communications medium may be subject to various types of interference, which is
commonly called noise.
■
Data communications and networking go hand in hand. Data communications is
the exchange of messages across a medium, and networking is the interconnection
of groups or systems with the purpose of exchanging information. Networks come
in a variety of types and can be categorized by size (LAN, MAN, WAN), topology
(bus, ring, star), or other criteria.
■
A number of organizations promote standardized components of data communica-
tions. Some standards are formal, or de jure; these standards have been reviewed
by a group of experts and endorsed by a standards body. Other standards are
informal, or de facto; these have been widely adopted without having been
formally reviewed.
■
Among the agencies that work on data communications standards are the Internet
Society (ISOC), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE), the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Introduction
The science of cryptography is not as enigmatic as you might think. Various cryptographic
techniques are used in everyday life. For example, open your newspaper to the entertainment
section and you may find the Daily Cryptogram, which is a word puzzle that involves
unscrambling letters to find a hidden message. Also, although it is a dying art, many court
reporters still use stenography—an abbreviated, symbolic writing method—to take rapid dic-
tation during legal proceedings. A form of cryptography is even used in knitting patterns,
where directions are written in coded form—for example, K1P1 (knit 1, purl 1), which only
an initiate can understand. These examples illustrate one common application of cryptogra-
phy: the efficient and rapid transmission of information.
In this textbook, we focus on the other critical aspects of cryptography: protecting and verify-
ing information transmitted via information systems. Cryptography, which comes from the
Greek words kryptos, meaning “hidden,” and graphein, meaning “to write,” is the process of
The EBS IT team was still preparing for the PCI audit. Things were going well, and the
necessary tasks were being documented. One of the key areas of concern involved
PCI Data Security Standard’s (DSS) Requirement 4, which governs the transmission of
cardholder data across public networks. Specifically, Requirement 4.1 calls for an
organization to “use strong cryptography and security protocols (SSL/TLS, IPSec, SSH,
etc.) to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public
networks.”1
At the time, EBS’s extranet with Davis Office Megaplex wasn’t being used to trans-
mit credit card data; however, during recent planning sessions at EBS, the Davis
group had outlined a solution that would allow EBS to resell office supplies to EBS
customers. This would allow EBS to provide business services to customers and also
sell office supplies to those same customers. However, this type of service would
require the transmission of customer credit card data across the extranet. To do so,
the IT staff would have to make sure the proper encryption was in place at all com-
munications levels to ensure that the credit card data was transmitted safely.
Paige Davis knew that there were encryption products out there that would
resolve the company’s extranet issue as well as other security problems. However,
she needed to do some research. Which encryption products would best fit EBS’s busi-
ness needs? Which products would provide the most security for the lowest cost?
What encryption algorithms would be used for the selected product to provide the
most security with the greatest performance while still meeting the PCI DSS require-
ments? Paige dived in to learning more about encryption.

making and using codes to secure the transmission of information. The science of encryption,
known as cryptology, encompasses both cryptography and cryptanalysis. Cryptanalysis is the
process of obtaining the original message (called the plaintext) from an encrypted message
(called the ciphertext) without knowing the keys used to perform the encryption. (Note: the
algorithms used in most current encryption are freely available and published to allow aca-
demic and professional review.) Encryption is the process of converting an original message
into a form that is unreadable to unauthorized individuals—that is, to anyone without the
tools to convert the encrypted message back to its original format. Decryption is the process
of converting the ciphertext message back into plaintext so that it can be readily understood.
These are key terms that will be used throughout the book.
The field of cryptology is so complex it can fill volumes; this textbook seeks to provide only a
general overview of cryptology and some specific information about cryptographic tools. The
early sections of this chapter provide background on cryptology and general definitions of key
concepts in cryptography. In later sections, you will learn about common cryptographic proto-
cols and some of the attack methods used against cryptosystems.
Terminology
To help you understand the fundamentals of cryptography, here are a number of additional
definitions:
●
Algorithm—The programmatic steps used to convert an unencrypted message into
an encrypted sequence of bits that represents the message; sometimes refers to the
programs that enable the cryptographic processes
●
Cipher or cryptosystem—An encryption method or process encompassing the algo-
rithm, key(s) and/or cryptovariable(s), and procedures used to perform encryption and
decryption
●
Ciphertext or cryptogram—The encoded message resulting from an encryption
●
Code—The process of converting components (words or phrases) of an unencrypted
message into encrypted components
●
Decipher—To decrypt, decode, or convert ciphertext into the equivalent plaintext
●
Encipher—To encrypt, encode, or convert plaintext into the equivalent ciphertext
●
Key or cryptovariable—The information used in conjunction with an algorithm to
create the ciphertext from the plaintext or derive the plaintext from the ciphertext; it
can be a series of bits used by a computer program, or it can be a passphrase used by
humans that is then converted into a series of bits used by a computer program
●
Keyspace—The entire range of values that can be used to construct an individual key
●
Link encryption—A series of encryptions and decryptions among a number of
systems, wherein each system in a network decrypts the message sent to it and then
re-encrypts it using different keys and sends it to the next neighbor, with this process
continuing until the message reaches the final destination
●
Nonrepudiation—Verification that a message was sent by a particular sender and
cannot be refuted
●
Plaintext or cleartext—The original unencrypted message, or a message that has been
successfully decrypted

History of Cryptology
Cryptology has a long history among the cultures of the world. Table 3-1 provides an
overview.
1900 BC
Egyptian scribes used nonstandard hieroglyphs while inscribing clay tablets; this is the first
documented use of written cryptography.
1500 BC
Mesopotamian cryptography surpassed that of the Egyptians. This is demonstrated in a tablet that
was discovered to contain an encrypted formula for pottery glazes; the tablet used special symbols
that appear to have different meanings from the usual symbols used elsewhere.
500 BC
Hebrew scribes writing the book of Jeremiah used a reversed alphabet substitution cipher known as
the Atbash.
487 BC
The Spartans of Greece developed the scytale, a system consisting of a strip of papyrus wrapped
around a wooden staff. Messages were written down the length of the staff, and the papyrus was
unwrapped. The decryption process involved wrapping the papyrus around a shaft of similar
diameter.
50 BC
Julius Caesar used a simple substitution cipher to secure military and government communications.
To form an encrypted text, Caesar shifted the letter of the alphabet three places. In addition to this
monoalphabetic substitution cipher, Caesar strengthened his encryption by substituting Greek letters
for Latin letters.
Fourth
and fifth
centuries
AD
The Kama Sutra of Vatsayana listed cryptography as the 44th and 45th of the 64 arts (yogas) that
men and women should practice: “44) The art of understanding writing in cipher, and the writing
of words in a peculiar way”; “45) The art of speaking by changing the forms of the word.”
725
Abu ’Abd al-Rahman al-Khalil ibn Ahman ibn ’Amr ibn Tammam al Farahidi al-Zadi al Yahmadi
wrote a book (now lost) on cryptography; he also solved a Greek cryptogram by guessing the
plaintext introduction.
855
Abu Wahshiyyaan-Nabati, a scholar, published several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt
magic formulas.
1250
Roger Bacon, an English monk, wrote Epistle of Roger Bacon on the Secret Works of Art and of
Nature and Also on the Nullity of Magic, in which he described several simple ciphers.
1392
The Equatorie of the Planetis, an early text possibly written by Geoffrey Chaucer, contained a
passage in a simple substitution cipher.

1412
Subhalasha, a 14-volume Arabic encyclopedia, contained a section on cryptography, including both
substitution and transposition ciphers, and ciphers with multiple substitutions, a technique that had
never been used before.
1466
Leon Battista Alberti, the “father of Western cryptography,” worked with polyalphabetic
substitution and also designed a cipher disk.
1518
Johannes Trithemius wrote the first printed book on cryptography and invented a steganographic
cipher in which each letter was represented as a word taken from a succession of columns. He also
described a polyalphabetic encryption method using a rectangular substitution format that is now
commonly used. He is credited with introducing the method of changing substitution alphabets
with each letter as it is deciphered.
1553
Giovan Batista Belaso introduced the idea of the passphrase (password) as a key for encryption; this
polyalphabetic encryption method is misnamed for another person who later used the technique,
today called the Vigenère cipher.
1563
Giovanni Battista Porta wrote a classification text on encryption methods, categorizing them as
transposition, substitution, and symbol substitution.
1623
Sir Francis Bacon described an encryption method employing one of the first uses of steganography;
he encrypted his messages by slightly changing the typeface of a random text so that each letter of
the cipher was hidden within the text.
1790s
Thomas Jefferson created a 26-letter wheel cipher, which he used for official communications while
ambassador to France; the concept of the wheel cipher would be reinvented in 1854 by Charles
Babbage, and again in 1913.
1861–
1865
During the U.S. Civil War, Union forces used a substitution encryption method based on specific
words, and the Confederacy used a polyalphabetic cipher whose solution had been published
before the start of the Civil War.
1914–
1917
During World War I, the Germans, British, and French used a series of transposition and substitution
ciphers in radio communications. All sides expended considerable effort toward intercepting and
decoding communications, and they thereby created the science of cryptanalysis. British
cryptographers broke the Zimmerman Telegram, in which the Germans offered Mexico U.S. territory
in return for Mexico’s support. This decryption helped to bring the United States into the war.
1917
William Frederick Friedman, the father of U.S. cryptanalysis, and his wife, Elizabeth, were employed
as civilian cryptanalysts by the U.S. government. Friedman later founded a school for cryptanalysis in
Riverbank, Illinois.
1917
Gilbert S. Vernam, an AT&T employee, invented a polyalphabetic cipher machine that used a
nonrepeating random key.
1919
Hugo Alexander Koch filed a patent in the Netherlands for a rotor-based cipher machine; in 1927,
Koch assigned the patent rights to Arthur Scherbius, the inventor of the Enigma machine, which
was a mechanical substitution cipher.
1927–33
During Prohibition, criminals in the United States began using cryptography to protect the privacy of
messages used in criminal activities.
1937
The Japanese developed the Purple machine, which was based on principles similar to those of
Enigma and used mechanical relays from telephone systems to encrypt diplomatic messages.
By late 1940, a team headed by William Friedman had broken the code generated by this machine
and constructed a machine that could quickly decode Purple’s ciphers.

Cipher Methods
There are two contemporary methods for encrypting plaintext: the bit stream method and the
block cipher method. In the bit stream method, each bit in the plaintext is transformed into a
cipher bit, 1 bit at a time. In the block cipher method, the message is divided into blocks—for
example, sets of 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit blocks—and then each block of plaintext bits is trans-
formed into an encrypted block of cipher bits using an algorithm and a key. Bit stream meth-
ods commonly use algorithm functions like the exclusive OR operation (XOR), whereas block
methods can use substitution, transposition, XOR, or some combination of these operations.
Note that most computer-based encryption methods operate on data at the level of its binary
digits (bits), but some operate at the byte or character level.
Substitution Cipher
With a substitution cipher, you substitute one value for another. For example, you can
replace a letter in the alphabet with the letter three values to the right. Alternatively, you
can replace one bit with a bit that is four places to its left. A three-character substitution to
the right results in the following transformation of the standard English alphabet:
Initial alphabet
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Encryption alphabet
DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
1939–
1942
The Allies secretly broke the Enigma cipher, undoubtedly shortening World War II.
1942
Navajo code talkers entered World War II; in addition to speaking a language that was unknown
outside a relatively small group within the United States, the Navajos developed code words for
subjects and ideas that did not exist in their native tongue.
1948
Claude Shannon suggested using frequency and statistical analysis in the solution of substitution
ciphers.
1970
Dr. Horst Feistel led an IBM research team in the development of the Lucifer cipher.
1976
A design based upon Lucifer was chosen by the U.S. National Security Agency as the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) and found worldwide acceptance.
1976
Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman introduced the idea of public-key cryptography with the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
1977
Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman developed a practical public-key cipher for both
confidentiality and digital signatures; the RSA family of computer encryption algorithms was born.
1978
The initial RSA algorithm was published in the Communication of ACM.
1991
Phil Zimmermann released the first version of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy); PGP was originally released
as freeware and became the worldwide standard for public cryptosystems.

Within this substitution scheme, the plaintext MOM would be encrypted into the ciphertext PRP.
This is a simple enough method by itself but very powerful if combined with other opera-
tions. This type of substitution is based on a monoalphabetic substitution because it only
uses one alphabet. More advanced substitution ciphers use two or more alphabets and are
referred to as polyalphabetic substitutions.
To extend the previous example, consider the following block of text:
Plaintext
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Substitution cipher 1
DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
Substitution cipher 2
GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEF
Substitution cipher 3
JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI
Substitution cipher 4
MNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKL
The first row is the plaintext, and the next four rows are four sets of substitution ciphers,
which when taken together constitute a single polyalphabetic substitution cipher. To encode
the word TEXT with this cipher, you substitute a letter from the second row for the first letter
in TEXT, a letter from the third row for the second letter, and so on—a process that yields the
ciphertext WKGF. Note how the plaintext letter T is transformed into a W or an F, depending
on its order of appearance in the plaintext. Complexities like these make this type of encryp-
tion substantially more difficult to decipher when one doesn’t have the algorithm (in this case,
the rows of ciphers) and the key, which is the method used (in this case, the use of the second
row for first letter, third row for second, and so on). A logical extension of this process is to
randomize the cipher rows completely in order to create a more complex operation.
One example of a substitution cipher is the cryptogram in the daily newspaper (see Figure 3-1);
another is the once-famous “Radio Orphan Annie” decoder pin, which consisted of two alpha-
betic rings that could be rotated to a predetermined pairing to form a simple substitution cipher.
The device was made to be worn as a pin so one could always be at the ready. As mentioned in
Table 3-1, Julius Caesar reportedly used a three-position shift to the right to encrypt his mes-
sages (so A became D, B became E, and so on), thus was this particular substitution cipher
given its name—the Caesar Cipher.

An advanced type of substitution cipher that uses a simple polyalphabetic code is the Vige-
nère cipher. It is implemented using the Vigenère Square (or table), which is made up of
26 distinct cipher alphabets. Figure 3-2 illustrates the setup of the Vigenère Square. In the
header row, the alphabet is written in its normal order. In each subsequent row, the alphabet
is shifted one letter to the right until a 26 x 26 block of letters is formed. There are a number
of ways to use the Vigenère Square. You could perform an encryption by simply starting in
the first row and finding a substitute for the first letter of plaintext, and then moving down
the rows for each subsequent letter of plaintext. With this method, the word SECURITY in
plaintext would become TGFYWOAG in ciphertext.
A much more sophisticated way to use the Vigenère Square would be to use a keyword to
represent the shift. To accomplish this, you begin by writing a keyword above the plaintext
message. For example, suppose the plaintext message was “SACK GAUL SPARE NO ONE”
and the keyword was “ITALY.” We, thus, end up with the following:
ITALYITALYITALYITA
SACKGAULSPARENOONE
Now, you use the keyword letter and the message (plaintext) letter below it in combination.
Returning to the Vigenère Square, notice how the first column of text, like the first row, forms
the normal alphabet. To perform the substitution, start with the first combination of keyword
and message letters, IS. Use the keyword letter to locate the column, and the message letter to
find the row, and then look for the letter at their intersection. Thus, for column “I” and row
“S,” you will find the ciphertext letter “A.” After you follow this procedure for each of the let-
ters in the message, you will produce the encrypted ciphertext ATCVEINLDNIKEYMWGE.

One weakness of this method is that any keyword-message letter combination containing an
“A” row or column reproduces the plaintext message letter. For example, the third letter in the
plaintext message, the C (of SACK), has a combination of AC and thus is unchanged in the
ciphertext. To minimize the effects of this weakness, you should avoid choosing a keyword
that contains the letter “A.”
Transposition Cipher
Like the substitution operation, the transposition cipher is simple to understand, but it can, if
properly used, produce ciphertext that is difficult to decipher. In contrast to the substitution
cipher, however, the transposition cipher (or permutation cipher) simply rearranges the values
within a block to create the ciphertext. This can be done at the bit level or at the byte (character)
level. For example, consider this transposition key pattern:
Key pattern:
1→4, 2→8, 3→1, 4→5, 5→7, 6→2, 7→6, 8→3
In this transposition key, the bit or byte (character) in position 1 (with position 1 being at the
far left as if transmitted from right to left) moves to position 4, and the bit or byte in position
2 moves to position 8, and so on. This is similar to another newspaper puzzle favorite: the
Word Jumble, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Using that same transposition key, consider this plaintext message, sent from left to right
starting with the 0 bit: 001001010110101110010101. What follows are the bit locations,
the plaintext, and the ciphertext that are produced when the key pattern is applied to the
plaintext, all three broken into 8-bit blocks for ease of discussion:
Bit Locations:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Plaintext:

Ciphertext:

Reading from left to right, the first bit of plaintext (position 1 of the first byte) becomes the
fourth bit (in position 4) of the first byte of the ciphertext. Similarly, the second bit of the
plaintext (position 2) becomes the eighth bit (position 8) of the ciphertext, and so on. To fur-
ther examine how this transposition key works, let’s see its effects on a plaintext message
composed of letters instead of bits. Using the same transposition cipher, here’s what we get
when we replace the 8-bit block of plaintext with the plaintext message “SACK GAUL
SPARE NO ONE”:
Letter Locations:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Plaintext:
S A C K _ G A U | L _ S P A R E _ | N O _ O N E _ _
Ciphertext:
C G U S K A _ A | S R _ L P E A _ | _ E _ N O _ N O
Remember the transposition pattern is:
1→4, 2→8, 3→1, 4→5, 5→7, 6→2, 7→6, 8→3. So, in
this example, reading from left to right, the letter in block 1, position 1 of the first block of
the plaintext (this is the letter “S”) moves to the position in block 1, character 4 in the
ciphertext. Then, still in block 1, we move the character found in position 2 (it is an “A”)
to the 8th position. Continuing, we move the third character (a letter “C”) to the first position.
This continues for all characters in block 1 and then repeats for subsequent blocks. So, the “P”
that is the fourth letter of the plaintext in block 2 is the same “P” found as the fifth letter of the
ciphertext in block 2. Note that the spaces in the original text are transposed as well.
In addition to being credited with inventing a substitution cipher, Julius Caesar was associ-
ated with an early version of the transposition cipher. In the Caesar block cipher, the recipi-
ent of the coded message fits the text to a prime number square (a square of text consisting
of a prime number of rows and columns). In practice, this means that if there are fewer than
25 characters, the recipient uses a 5 x 5 square. For example, if you were the recipient of
the Caesar ciphertext shown below, you would make a square of 5 columns and 5 rows,
then write the letters of the message into the square, filling the slots from left to right, top to
bottom. You would then read the message from the opposite direction—that is, from top to
bottom, left to right.

Reading from top to bottom, left to right reveals the plaintext “SACK GAUL SPARE NO

When mechanical and electronic cryptosystems became more widely used, transposition
ciphers and substitution ciphers were combined to produce highly secure encryption pro-
cesses. To make the encryption even stronger (more difficult to cryptanalyze), the keys and
block sizes can be made much larger (up to 128 bits), which produces substantially more
complex substitutions or transpositions.

The exclusive OR operation (XOR) is a function of a binary operation in which two bits are
compared and (1) if the two bits are identical, the result is a binary 0, and (2) if the two bits
are not the same, the result is a binary 1. XOR encryption is a very simple symmetric cipher
that is used in many applications where security is not a defined requirement. Table 3-2
shows an XOR truth table with the results of all the possible combinations of two bits.
To see how XOR works, consider the plaintext “CAT.” The binary representation of the
plaintext is “01110000 01100101 1000000.” In order to encrypt the plaintext, a secret key
value needs to be selected for the encryption operation. In this case, the bit pattern for the let-
ter “V” (10000101) is used, and it is repeated for each character to be encrypted, left to
right. Performing the XOR operation on the two bit streams (the plaintext and the key) pro-
duces the result shown in Table 3-3.
The row of Table 3-3 labeled “Cipher” contains the bit stream that will be transmitted; when
this cipher is received, it can be decrypted using the key value of “V.” Note that the XOR
encryption method is very simple to implement and equally simple to break, if you have the
key. The XOR encryption method should not be used by itself when an organization is trans-
mitting or storing sensitive data. Actual encryption algorithms used to protect data typically
use the XOR operator as part of a more complex encryption process.
You can combine the XOR operation with a block cipher operation to produce a simple but
powerful operation. In the example that follows, the first row shows the character message
that requires encryption: “5E5+•”. The second row shows this message in binary notation.
In order to apply an 8-bit block cipher method, the binary message is broken into 8-bit
blocks in the row labeled “Message Blocks.” The fourth row shows the 8-bit key
(01010101) chosen for the encryption. To encrypt the message, you must perform the XOR

to determine the bits of the ciphertext until the entire message is enciphered. The result is
shown in the row labeled “Ciphertext.” This ciphertext can now be sent to a receiver, who
will be able to decipher the message by simply knowing the algorithm (XOR) and the key
(01010101).

If the receiver cannot apply the key to the ciphertext and derive the original message, either
the cipher was applied with an incorrect key or the cryptosystem was not used correctly.
Vernam Cipher
Also known as the one-time pad, the Vernam cipher, which was developed at AT&T, uses a
set of characters only one time for each encryption process (hence, the name one-time pad).
The pad in the name comes from the days of manual encryption and decryption, when the
key values for each ciphering session were prepared by hand and bound into an easy-to-use
form—that is, a pad of paper. To perform the Vernam cipher encryption operation, the pad
values are added to numeric values that represent the plaintext that needs to be encrypted.
Each character of the plaintext is turned into a number, and a pad value for that position is
added to it. The resulting sum for that character is then converted back to a ciphertext char-
acter for transmission. If the sum of the two values exceeds 26, then 26 is subtracted from
the total. (Note that the process of keeping a computed number within a specific range is a
key concept in modular arithmetic. Requiring that all numbers be in the range 1–26 is
referred to as modulo 26. In modulo 26, if a number is larger than 26, then 26 is sequentially
subtracted from it until the number is in the proper range.)
To examine the Vernam cipher and its use of modular arithmetic, consider the following
example, which uses “SACK GAUL SPARE NO ONE” as plaintext. In the first step of this
encryption process, the letter “S” is converted into the number 19 (because it is the 19th let-
ter of the alphabet), and the same conversion is applied to the rest of the letters of the plain-
text message, as shown below. Rows 3 and 4 show, respectively, the one-time pad text and

As you can see, the pad value, like the plaintext value, is derived from the position of each
pad text letter in the alphabet; thus, the pad text letter “F” is assigned the value of 06. This
conversion process is repeated for the entire one-time pad text. Next, the plaintext value and
the one-time pad value are added together; the first such sum is 25. Because 25 is in the
range of 1 to 26, no modulo 26 subtraction is required. The sum remains 25, and yields the
ciphertext “Y.” Skipping ahead to the fourth character of the plaintext, “K,” the plaintext
value for it is 11. The pad text is “R,” and the one-time pad value is 18. The sum of 11 and
18 is 29. Because 29 is larger than 26, 26 is subtracted from it, which yields the value 03.
The ciphertext for this plaintext character is then the third letter of the alphabet, “C.”
Decryption of any ciphertext generated from a one-time pad requires either knowledge of the
pad values or the use of elaborate and (the encrypting party hopes) very difficult cryptanaly-
sis. Using the pad values and the ciphertext, the decryption process works as follows: “Y”
becomes the number 25, from which we subtract the pad value for the first letter of the mes-
sage, 06. This yields a value of 19, or the letter “S.” This pattern continues until the fourth
letter of the ciphertext, where the ciphertext letter is “C” and the pad value is 18. Subtracting
18 from 3 yields negative 15. Because modulo 26 is employed, which requires that all num-
bers be in the range of 1–26, you must add (not subtract) 26 to negative 15. This gives a
sum of 11, which means that the fourth letter of the message is “K.”
Book or Running Key Cipher
One encryption method made popular by spy movies involves using the text in a book as the
key to decrypt a message. The ciphertext consists of a list of codes representing the page
number, line number, and word number of the plaintext word. The algorithm is the mechan-
ical process of looking up the references from the ciphertext and converting each reference to
a word by using the ciphertext’s value and the key (the book). For example, from a copy of
a particular popular novel, one may send the message 259, 19, 8; 22, 3, 8; 375, 7, 4; 394,
17, 2. Although almost any book can be used, dictionaries and thesauruses are typically the
most popular sources, as they are likely to contain almost any word that might be needed.
The recipient of a running key cipher must first know which book is used—in this case,
let’s say the science fiction novel A Fire Upon the Deep (1992 TOR edition). To decrypt
the ciphertext, the receiver acquires the book and turns to page 259, finds line 19, and
selects the eighth word in that line (which is “SACK”). The receiver then turns to page 22,
line 3, and selects the eighth word again, and so forth. In this example, the resulting message
is “SACK ISLAND SHARP PATH.” If dictionaries are used, the message could consist of
only the page number and the number of the word on the page. An even more sophisticated
version might use multiple books, perhaps even in a particular sequence for each word or
phrase.
Another variation of the book cipher is the grille cipher, which uses a stencil or template
with holes cut out. When the template is applied to a particular message, book, or other doc-
ument, the message is revealed in the holes (apertures). This also represents a form of stega-
nography. Not only must the template be possessed, the reader must know the sequence of
revealed letters or words in order to understand the message.
Hash Functions
In addition to ciphers, an important encryption technique that is often incorporated into
cryptosystems is the hash function. Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that generate

a message summary or digest (sometimes called a fingerprint) that can be used to confirm the
identity of a specific message and/or confirm that there have not been any changes to the
content. Although they do not create a ciphertext, hash functions confirm message identity
and integrity, both of which are critical functions in e-commerce.
Hash algorithms are mathematical functions that create a hash value, also known as a mes-
sage digest, by converting variable-length messages into a single fixed-length value. The mes-
sage digest is a “fingerprint” of the author’s message, which is compared with the recipient’s
locally calculated hash of the same message. If the two hashes are identical after transmis-
sion, the message has arrived without modification. Hash functions are considered one-way
operations in that the same message always provides the same hash value, but the hash
value itself cannot be used to determine the contents of the message.
Hashing functions do not require the use of keys, but it is possible to attach a message
authentication code (MAC)—a key-dependent, one-way hash function that allows only spe-
cific recipients (symmetric key holders) to access the message digest. Because hash functions
are one-way, they are used in password verification systems to confirm the identity of the
user. In such systems, the hash value, or message digest, is calculated based upon the origi-
nally issued password, and this message digest is stored for later comparison. When the user
logs on for the next session, the system calculates a hash value based on the user’s password
input, and this value is compared against the stored value to confirm identity.
The Secure Hash Standard (SHS) is a standard issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-2 specifies
the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) as a secure algorithm for computing a condensed
representation of a message or data file. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit message digest, which
can be used as an input to a digital signature algorithm. SHA-1 is based on principles mod-
eled after MD4 (which is part of the MDx family of hash algorithms created by Ronald Riv-
est). Other hash algorithms (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) have also been
specified in FIPS 180-2 as standards, with digests of 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits, respec-
tively. The number of bits used in the hash algorithm is a measurement of the strength of
the algorithm against collision attacks. SHA-256 is essentially a 256-bit block cipher algo-
rithm that creates a key by encrypting the intermediate hash value with the message block
functioning as the key. The compression function operates on each 512-bit message block
and a 256-bit intermediate message digest.2 As shown in Figure 3-4, there are free tools that
can calculate hash values by using a number of popular algorithms.
In general, if attackers gain access to a list of hashed passwords, they can use a combination
of brute force and dictionary attacks to reveal user passwords. Passwords that are dictionary
words or poorly constructed can be easily cracked. However, an attack method called rain-
bow cracking has generated significant concern about the strength of the processes used for
password hashing—even for well-constructed passwords. Using a rainbow table—a database
of precomputed hashes from sequentially calculated passwords—the rainbow cracker simply
looks up the hashed password in the massive list and reads out the text version, with no
brute force required. This type of attack is more properly classified as a time-memory trade-
off attack.
To defend against this type of attack, you must first protect the file of hashed passwords and
implement strict limits to the number of attempts allowed per login session. You can also use
an approach called password hash salting. Salting is the process of providing a nonsecret,

random piece of data to the hashing function when the hash is first calculated. The salt value
is not kept a secret; it is stored along with the account identifier so that the hash value can be
recreated during authentication.3 The use of a salt value creates a different hash, and when a
large set of salt values is used, rainbow cracking fails because it makes the reverse calculation
of the time-memory tradeoff attack of no value to the attacker.
Cryptographic Algorithms
Cryptographic algorithms are often grouped into two broad categories—symmetric and
asymmetric—but today’s most popular cryptosystems use a combination of symmetric
and asymmetric algorithms. These are distinguished by the types of keys they use for
encryption and decryption operations, and how those keys are distributed. This section
begins with an examination of the notation methods used to describe how these algo-
rithms function.
Cryptographic Notation
The notation used to describe an encryption process varies, depending on the source describ-
ing the encryption. The notation used in this textbook uses the letter “M” to represent the
original message, “C” to represent the resulting ciphertext, and “E” to represent the encryp-
tion process—thus, the formula, E(M) = C.4 This formula represents the application of
encryption (E) to a message (M) to create ciphertext (C). Also in this notation scheme, the
letter “D” represents the decryption or deciphering process—thus, the formula D[E(M)] =
M, which states that if you decipher (D) an enciphered message (E(M)), you get the original
message (M). This can also be stated as D[C]=M, or the deciphering of the ciphertext

(remember that C=E(M)) results in the original message M. Finally, the letter “K” is used to
represent the key; therefore, E(M,K) = C states that encrypting (E) the message (M) with the
key (K) results in the ciphertext (C). Similarly, D(C,K) = D[E(M,K),K] = M, which states that
deciphering the ciphertext with key K results in the original plaintext message. Or, to trans-
late this formula even more precisely: deciphering with key K the message encrypted with
key K results in the original message.
Symmetric Encryption
Encryption methodologies that require the same secret key to encipher and decipher the mes-
sage are using private key encryption or symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption meth-
ods use mathematical operations that can be programmed into extremely fast computing
algorithms so that the encryption and decryption processes are executed quickly by even
small computers. As you can see in Figure 3-5, one of the challenges is that both the sender
and the recipient must have the secret key. Also, if either copy of the key falls into the
wrong hands, messages can be decrypted by others and the sender and intended receiver
may not know the message has been intercepted. The primary challenge of symmetric key
encryption is getting the key to the receiver, a process that must be conducted out-of-band
(i.e., through a channel or band other than the one carrying the ciphertext) to avoid
interception.
Data Encryption Standard (DES) There are a number of popular symmetric
encryption cryptosystems. One of the most widely known is Data Encryption Standard
(DES), which was developed by IBM and is based on the company’s Lucifer algorithm,
which uses a key length of 128 bits. Using a 64-bit block size and a 56-bit key, DES
Rachel at ABC Corp. generates a secret key. She must somehow
get it to Alex at XYZ Corp. out of band. Once Alex has it, Rachel can
use it to encrypt messages, and Alex can use it to decrypt and read them.

was adopted by NIST in 1976 as a federal standard for encryption of nonclassified
information, after which it became widely employed in commercial applications. It
enjoyed increasing popularity for almost 20 years, until 1997, when users realized that a
56-bit key size did not provide an acceptable level of security. In 1998, a group called
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org), using a specially designed computer,
broke a DES key in just over 56 hours. Since then, it has been theorized that a dedi-
cated attack supported by the proper hardware (not necessarily a specialized computer)
can break a DES key in less than four hours.
Triple DES (3DES) Triple DES (3DES) was created to provide a level of security far
beyond that of DES. Triple DES encryption is the same as that of standard DES, except it
is repeated three times. 3DES was an advanced application of DES, and although it did
deliver on its promise of encryption strength beyond DES, it too soon proved too weak to
survive indefinitely—especially as computing power continued to double every 18 months
(known as Moore’s law).
3DES takes three 64-bit keys for an overall key length of 192 bits. It can be employed using
two or three keys and a combination of encryption or decryption, for additional security.
The most common implementations involve encrypting and/or decrypting with two or three
different keys, a process that is described next. 3DES employs 48 rounds in its encryption
computation, generating ciphers that are approximately 256 (72 quadrillion) times stronger
than standard DES ciphers but require only three times longer to process. Three types of
3DES encryption operations are illustrated here:
1.
In the first option, 3DES encrypts the message with Key 1, then decrypts it with Key 2,
then encrypts it again with Key 1. In cryptographic notation, this is [E{D[E(M,K1)],K2},
K1]. Decrypting with a different key is essentially another encryption, but it reverses the
application of the traditional encryption operations.
2.
In the second option, 3DES encrypts the message with Key 1, then encrypts it again
with Key 2, then encrypts it a third time with Key 1 again—that is, [E{E[E(M,K1)],
K2},K1].
3.
In the third option, 3DES encrypts the message three times with three different keys—that
is, [E{E[E(M,K1)],K2},K3]. Of the three options, this is the most secure encryption oper-
ation possible with 3DES.
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) The successor to 3DES is Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) that
specifies a cryptographic algorithm used within the U.S. government to protect information
in federal agencies that are not a part of the national defense infrastructure. (Agencies that
are considered a part of national defense use other, more secure methods of encryption,
which are provided by the National Security Agency.)
AES was developed to replace both DES and 3DES. Although 3DES remains an approved
algorithm for some uses, its expected useful life is limited. Historically, cryptographic stan-
dards approved by FIPS have been adopted on a voluntary basis by organizations outside

government. The AES selection process involved cooperation between the U.S. govern-
ment, private companies, and universities around the world.
Of the many ciphers that were submitted from around the world for consideration in the AES
selection process, five finalists were chosen: MARS, RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, and Twofish. On
October 2, 2000, NIST announced the selection of Rijndael as the cipher to be used as the
basis for the AES, and this block cipher was approved by the secretary of commerce as the
official federal governmental standard as of May 26, 2002.
AES implements a block cipher called the Rijndael Block Cipher, with a variable block length
and a key length of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Experts estimate that the special computer used by
the Electronic Frontier Foundation to crack DES within a couple of days would require
approximately 4.7 x 1024 (or 4,698,864 quintillion years) to crack AES.
AES can use a multiple-round-based system. Depending on the key size, the number of rounds
varies between 9 and 13. For a 128-bit key, 9 rounds plus one end round are used; for a 192-
bit key, 11 rounds plus one end round are used; and for a 256-bit key, 13 rounds plus one
end round are used. Once Rijndael was adopted as the AES, the ability to use variably sized
blocks was standardized to a single 128-bit block, for simplicity.
Asymmetric Encryption
Whereas symmetric encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt a message,
asymmetric encryption uses two different but related keys, and either key can be used to
encrypt or decrypt the message. If, however, Key A is used to encrypt the message, only Key
B can decrypt it, and if Key B is used to encrypt a message, only Key A can decrypt it. Asym-
metric encryption can be used to provide elegant solutions to problems of secrecy and verifi-
cation. This technique has its highest value when one key is used as a private key, which
means that it is kept secret (much like the key of symmetric encryption), known only to the
owner of the key pair, and the other key serves as a public key, which means that it is stored
in a public location where anyone can use it. This is why the more common name for asym-
metric encryption is public-key encryption.
Consider the following example, illustrated in Figure 3-6. Alex at XYZ Corporation wants to
send an encrypted message to Rachel at ABC Corporation. Alex goes to a public-key registry
and obtains Rachel’s public key. Remember that the foundation of asymmetric encryption is
that the same key cannot be used to both encrypt and decrypt the same message. So when
Rachel’s public key is used to encrypt the message, only Rachel’s private key can be used to
decrypt the message, and that private key is held by Rachel alone. Similarly, if Rachel wants
to respond to Alex’s message, she goes to the registry where Alex’s public key is held and
uses it to encrypt her message, which can only be read by Alex’s private key. This approach,
which keeps private keys secret and encourages the sharing of public keys in reliable
directories, is an elegant solution to the key management problems of symmetric key
applications.
Asymmetric algorithms are one-way functions. A one-way function is simple to compute in
one direction but complex to compute in the opposite direction. This is the foundation of
public-key encryption. Public-key encryption is based on a hash value, which, as you learned
earlier in this chapter, is calculated from an input number using a hashing algorithm. This
hash value is essentially a summary of the original input values. It is virtually impossible to

derive the original values without knowing how those values were used to create the hash
value. For example, if you multiply 45 by 235, you get 10,575. But if you are simply given
the number 10,575, can you determine which two numbers were multiplied to arrive at this
number? Now, let’s assume that each multiplier is 200 digits long and a prime number. The
multiplicative product would be up to 400 digits long. Imagine the time you’d need to factor
that out.
Note that there is a shortcut, however. In mathematics, it is known as a trapdoor (which is
different from a software trapdoor). A mathematical trapdoor is a “secret mechanism that
enables you to easily accomplish the reverse function in a one-way function.”5 With a trap-
door, you can use a key to encrypt or decrypt the ciphertext, but not both, thus it requires
two keys. The public key becomes the true key, and the private key is derived from the public
key using the trapdoor.
RSA Algorithm Function One of the most popular asymmetric key cryptosystems is
RSA, the name of which is derived from Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, the algorithm’s developers.
The RSA algorithm was the first asymmetric, or public-key, encryption algorithm developed
(in 1977) and published for commercial use. It is very popular and has been embedded in
most Web browsers to enable them to provide security for e-commerce applications. The
patented RSA algorithm has in fact become the de facto standard for public use encryption
applications.
If you understand modular arithmetic, you can appreciate the complexities of the RSA algo-
rithm. It is based on the large amount of computational work required in factoring large com-
posite numbers and computing the so-called eth roots modulo, a composite number for a spec-
ified odd integer (e). Encryption in RSA is accomplished by raising the message M to a
nonnegative integer power e. The product is then divided by the nonnegative modulus n

(which should have a bit length of at least 1024), and the remainder is the ciphertext C. This
process results in one-way operation (shown below) when n is a very large number.
C = Me / mod n
In the decryption process, the ciphertext C is raised to the power d, a nonnegative integer, as
follows:
d = e-1 mod ((p-1)(q-1))
C is then reduced by modulo n. In order for the recipient to calculate the decryption key, the
p and q factors must be known. The modulus n, which is a composite number, is determined
by multiplying two large nonnegative prime numbers, p and q (in these discussions, * is used
as the symbol for multiplication):
n = p * q
In RSA’s asymmetric algorithm, which is the basis of most modern Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI) systems (a topic covered later in this chapter), the public and private keys are generated
using the following procedure, created by the RSA Corporation:
●
Choose two large prime numbers, p and q, of equal length, and compute p * q = n,
which is the public modulus.
●
Choose a random public key, e, so that e and (p-1)(q-1) are relatively prime.
●
Compute e * d = 1 mod (p – 1)(q – 1), where d is the private key.
●
Thus, d = e-1mod[(p – 1)(q – 1)] where (d, n) is the private key; (e, n) is the public
key. Plaintext P is encrypted to generate ciphertext C as C = Pe mod n, and is
decrypted to recover the plaintext P as P = Cd mod n.
The RSA algorithm has three major operations:
1.
Key generation—Prime factors p and q are selected by a statistical technique known as
probabilistic primality testing and then multiplied together to form n. The encryption
exponent e is selected, and the decryption exponent d is calculated.
2.
Encryption—M is raised to the power of e, reduced by modulo n, and remainder C is
the ciphertext.
3.
Decryption—C is raised to the power of d and reduced by modulo n.
The sender publishes the public key, which consists of modulus n and exponent e. The
remaining variables—d, p, and q—are kept secret. If p and q are not big enough for the cipher
to be secure, they must be made bigger. The strength of this encryption algorithm relies on
how difficult it is to factor p and q from n if n is known. If n is not known, the algorithm is
even harder to break, of course.
A message can then:
●
Be encrypted by: C = Me(recipient) mod n(recipient)
●
Be digitally signed by: C’ = M’d(sender) mod n(sender)
●
Be verified by: M’ = C’e(sender) mod n(sender)
●
Be decrypted by: M = Cd(recipient) mod n(recipient)

Hybrid Cryptography Systems
The problem with asymmetric encryption, as was shown in Figure 3-6 is that holding a single
conversation between two parties requires four keys. Moreover, if four organizations want to
exchange communications, each party must manage its own private key and four public keys.
In such scenarios, determining which public key is needed to encrypt a particular message can
become a rather confusing problem, and with more organizations in the loop, the problem
expands. This is why asymmetric encryption is sometimes regarded by experts as inefficient in
terms of CPU computations. Consequently, hybrid systems are more commonly used.
The most common hybrid system is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which is a
method for exchanging private keys using public-key encryption. Figure 3-7 shows a simpli-
fied example of how the key exchange works.
Mathematically the two users share a prime number and a base (p & g). They each think up
a secret number and use the two values to create a product (ga mod p = A, for example). The
other person creates his or her version (gb mod p = B), and the two values are exchanged.
They can then both calculate a shared secret value (Ba mod p = s = Ab mod p) and use that
secret key for future data exchanges.

Created in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
uses asymmetric encryption to exchange session keys. These are limited-use symmetric keys
for temporary communications; they allow two organizations to conduct quick, efficient,
secure communications based on symmetric encryption. Diffie-Hellman provides the founda-
tion for subsequent developments in public key-encryption. Because symmetric encryption is
more efficient than asymmetric for sending messages, and because asymmetric encryption
doesn’t require out-of-band key exchange, asymmetric encryption can be used to transmit
symmetric keys in a hybrid approach. Diffie-Hellman protects data from exposure to third
parties, which is sometimes a problem when keys are exchanged out-of-band.
A hybrid encryption approach is illustrated in Figure 3-8. Here, Alex at XYZ Corp. wants to
communicate with Rachel at ABC Corp., so Alex first creates a session key. He encrypts a
message with this session key, then gets Rachel’s public key. Alex uses Rachel’s public
key to encrypt both the session key and the message, which is already encrypted. He then
transmits the entire package to Rachel, who uses her private key to decrypt the package
containing the session key and the encrypted message, then uses the session key to decrypt the
message. Rachel can continue to use only this session key for electronic communications until
the session key expires. The asymmetric session key is used in the much more efficient asymmet-
ric encryption and decryption processes. After the session key expires (usually in a few minutes),
a new session key is chosen and shared using the same process.
Encryption Key Size
When deploying ciphers, users have to decide on the size of the cryptovariable or key. This is
very important, because the strength of many encryption applications and cryptosystems is
measured by key size. How exactly does key size affect the strength of an algorithm? Typi-
cally, the length of the key increases the number of random guesses that have to be made in
Private key B
decrypts message.
Rachel at ABC Corp. stores her public key where it can be accessed. Alex at XYZ
Corp. retrieves it and uses it to encrypt his session (symmetric) key. He sends it to
Rachel, who decrypts Alex’s session key with her private key, and then uses Alex’s
session key for short-term private communications.

order to break the code. Creating a larger number of possibilities increases the time required
to make guesses, and thus a longer key directly influences the strength of the encryption.
It may surprise you to learn that when it comes to cryptosystems, the security of encrypted
data is not dependent on keeping the encrypting algorithm secret; in fact, algorithms should
be (and often are) published, so that research to uncover their weaknesses can be done. The
security of any cryptosystem depends on keeping some or all of the elements of the crypto-
variable(s) or key(s) secret, and effective security is maintained by manipulating the size (bit
length) of the keys and by following proper procedures and policies for key management.
For a simple example of how key size is related to encryption strength, suppose you have an
algorithm that uses a three-bit key. You may recall from earlier in the chapter that keyspace
is the entire range of characters from which the key can be drawn. Also, you may recall that
in binary notation, 3 bits can be used to represent values from 000 to 111, which correspond
to the numbers 0 to 7 in decimal notation and, thus, a keyspace of eight keys. This means
that an algorithm that uses a 3-bit key has eight possible keys (the numbers 0 to 7 in binary
are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111). If you know how many keys you have to
choose from, you can program a computer to try all the keys to attempt to crack the
encrypted message.
The preceding paragraph presumes a few things: (1) you know the algorithm, (2) you have
the encrypted message, and (3) you have time on your hands. It is easy to satisfy the first cri-
terion. The encryption tools that use DES can be purchased over the counter. Many of these
tools are based on encryption algorithms that are standards, as is DES itself; therefore, it is
relatively easy to get a cryptosystem based on DES that would enable you to decrypt an
encrypted message if you possess the key. The second criterion requires the interception of
an encrypted message, which is illegal but not impossible. As for the third criterion, the task
required is a brute force attack, in which a computer randomly (or sequentially) selects possi-
ble keys of the known size and applies them to the encrypted text or a piece of the encrypted
text. If the result is plaintext, bingo! But as indicated earlier in this chapter, it can take quite
a long time to exert brute force on the more advanced cryptosystems. In fact, the strength of
an algorithm is determined by how long it takes to guess the key.
When it comes to keys, however, how big is enough? As you learned earlier in this section,
a 3-bit system has eight possible keys. Furthermore, an 8-bit system has 256 possible keys.
Note, however, that a 32-bit system, puny by modern standards, has almost 16.8 million
possible keys. Even so, an average PC, such as the one described in Table 3-4, could discover
this key in mere seconds. However, as Table 3-4 shows, the amount of time needed to
crack a cipher by guessing its key grows very quickly—that is, exponentially with each
additional bit.
Although the estimated time to crack an encryption key grows rapidly with respect to the
number of bits in the encryption key, it is not impossible to crack the key. Table 3-4 doesn’t
account for the fact that computing power has increased (and continues to increase). There-
fore, these days even the once-standard 56-bit encryption can’t stand up to brute force
attacks by personal computers, especially if multiple computers are used to crack these keys.
Each additional computer reduces the amount of time needed. Two computers can divide
the possibilities and crack the key in approximately half the time, and so on. Thus, 285
computers can crack a 56-bit key in one year; ten times as many would do it in a little over
a month.

Multiple Encryption Methods
Why do encryption systems such as DES incorporate multiple elements or operations? Con-
sider this: if you use the same operation (XOR, substitution, or transposition) multiple
times, you gain no additional benefit. For example, if, using a substitution cipher, you substitute
B for A, then R for B, then Q for R, it has the same effect as if you had substituted Q for A.
Similarly, if you transpose a character in position 1 to position 4, then to position 3, you
could more easily transpose the character from position 1 to position 3. There is no net
advantage for sequential operations unless each subsequent operation is different. There-
fore, if you substitute, then transpose, then XOR, then substitute again, you will have dra-
matically scrambled, substituted, and recoded the original plaintext with ciphertext that is
untraceable without the key.
Encrypted Communications
Much of the software programs currently used to protect the confidentiality of information
are not true cryptosystems. Instead, they are applications to which cryptographic protocols
have been added. This is perhaps particularly true of Internet protocols; some experts claim
that the Internet and its corresponding protocols were designed without any consideration for
security, which was added as an afterthought. Whether or not this is true, the lack of threats
in the environment in which it was launched allowed the Internet to grow rapidly. As the
number of threats grew, however, so did the need for additional security measures.

Note: In most cases, it takes one operation to calculate a password and then at least one operation to test the password; however, this example assumes that each
guess only requires one operation. Doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled, the relative values of the times don’t vary much: 56-bit or less is insufficient for sensitive data,
64-bit is marginal, and 128-bit and larger is more than sufficient. The modern standards are 128- and 256-bit (AES), with 512- and 1024-bit encryption available.

Securing Network Communications with IPSec and SSH
Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) and Secure Shell (SSH) are widely used to enable secure net-
work communications across LANs, WANs, and the Internet. IPSec is most often used to cre-
ate a secure virtual private network (VPN) over an insecure medium like the Internet, and
SSH is used to secure remote logins. Both use encryption to ensure that the confidentiality
and integrity of transmitted data is protected.
IPSec Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is an open-source protocol framework for security
development within the TCP/IP family of protocol standards. It is used to secure communi-
cations across IP-based networks such as LANs, WANs, and the Internet by protecting data
integrity, user confidentiality, and authenticity at the IP packet level. IPSec is the crypto-
graphic authentication and encryption product of the IETF’s IP Protocol Security Working
Group. It is often described as the security system from IP version 6 (the future version of
the TCP/IP protocol), retrofitted for use with IP version 4 (the current version). IPSec is
defined in Request for Comments (RFC) 1825, 1826, and 1827 and is widely used to create
VPNs.
IPSec includes the IP Security protocol itself, which specifies the information to be added to an
IP packet as well as how to encrypt packet data, and the Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which
uses an asymmetric-based key exchange and negotiates the security associations. IPSec oper-
ates in two modes: transport and tunnel. In transport mode, only the IP data are encrypted,
not the IP headers. This allows intermediate nodes to read the source and destination
addresses. In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted and then placed into the content
portion of another IP packet. This requires other systems at the beginning and end of the tun-
nel to act as proxies and to send and receive the encrypted packets. These systems then trans-
mit the decrypted packets to their true destinations.
IPSec uses several different cryptosystems:
●
Diffie-Hellman key exchange for deriving key material between peers on a public
network
●
Public-key cryptography for signing the Diffie-Hellman exchanges to guarantee the
identity of the two parties
●
Bulk encryption algorithms, such as DES, for encrypting the data
●
Digital certificates signed by a certificate authority to act as digital ID cards6
Within IPSec, IP layer security is achieved by means of an authentication header protocol or an
encapsulating security payload protocol. The authentication header (AH) protocol provides
system-to-system authentication and data integrity verification but does not provide secrecy for
the content of a network communication. The encapsulating security payload (ESP) protocol
provides secrecy for the contents of network communications, as well as system-to-system
authentication and data integrity verification. When two networked systems form an associa-
tion that uses encryption and authentication keys, algorithms, and key lifetimes, they can imple-
ment either the AH or the ESP protocol, but not both. If the security functions of both the AH
and ESP are required, multiple security associations must be bundled to provide the correct
sequence through which the IP traffic must be processed to deliver the desired security features.
The AH protocol is designed to provide data integrity and IP packet authentication.
Although AH does not provide confidentiality protection, IP packets are protected from

replay attacks and address spoofing as well as other types of cyberattacks against open net-
works. Figure 3-9 shows the packet format of the IPSec AH protocol. As shown in this dia-
gram, the security parameter index (SPI) references the session key and algorithm used to
protect the data being transported. Sequence numbers allow packets to arrive out of
sequence for reassembly. The integrity check value (ICV) of the authentication data serves
as a checksum to verify that the packet itself is unaltered. Whether used in IPv4 or IPv6,
authentication secures the entire packet, excluding mutable fields in the new IP header. In
tunnel mode, however, the entire inner IP packet is secured by the authentication header
protocol. The ESP protocol provides confidentiality services for IP packets across insecure
networks. ESP can also provide the authentication services of AH.
Figure 3-9 also shows information on the ESP packet header. ESP in tunnel mode can be used
to establish a VPN, assuring encryption and authentication between networks communicating
via the Internet. In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted with the attached ESP
header. A new IP header is attached to the encrypted payload, providing the required routing
information.

An ESP header is inserted into the IP packet prior to the TCP header, and an ESP trailer is
placed after the IPv4 packet. If authentication is desired, an ESP authentication data field is
appended after the ESP trailer. The complete transport segment is encrypted, in addition to
the ESP trailer. In an IPv6 transmission, the ESP header is placed after the hop-by-hop and
routing headers. Encryption under IPv6 covers the transport segment and the ESP trailer.
Authentication in both IPv4 and IPv6 covers the ciphertext data plus the ESP header. IPSec
ESP-compliant systems must support the implementation of the DES algorithm utilizing the
CBC (cipher block chaining) mode, which incorporates the following encryption algorithms:
Triple DES, IDEA, RC5, CAST, and Blowfish.
SSH The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol was developed in order to provide a secure method
for accessing systems over an insecure medium. The latest version of the protocol, SSH-2,
offers a number of improved security features over its predecessor, SSH-1. SSH is most com-
monly used to access UNIX and Linux system shells as a replacement for the less secure
remote login protocols, like Telnet. SSH also supports a number of encryption technologies
in order to provide a secure communications channel between client and server.
Securing Web Communications with SSL and S-HTTP
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP) are designed to
enable secure Web communications for e-commerce, banking, and a number of other sensi-
tive uses. By adding encryption to standard HTTP and TCP communication, SSL and S-
HTTP ensure TCP/IP security via different mechanisms and can be used independently or
together.
SSL The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used for public-key encryption to secure a
channel over the Internet. Most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Safari, and Chrome, use SSL and can thank the group that created the original Netscape
browser for creating SSL. In addition to providing data encryption, integrity, and server
authentication, SSL can, when properly configured, provide client authentication.
SSL uses a number of algorithms but mainly relies on RSA for key transfer and on IDEA,
DES, or 3DES for encrypted symmetric-key-based data transfer. Figure 3-10 illustrates the
kind of certificate and SSL information that is displayed when you are checking out of an
e-commerce site. If your Web connection does not automatically display such certificates, you
can right-click in your browser’s window and select Properties to view the connection encryp-
tion and certificate properties.
The SSL protocol works as follows. During a normal client/server HTTP session, when the cli-
ent requests access to a portion of the Web site that requires secure communication, the server
sends a message to the client indicating that a secure connection must be established. The cli-
ent sends its public key and security parameters. This handshaking phase is complete when
the server finds a public-key match and sends a digital certificate to the client in order to
authenticate itself. Once the client verifies that the certificate is valid and trustworthy, the SSL
session is established. Until the client or the server terminates the session, any amount of data
can be transmitted securely via the SSL session.
SSL provides two protocol layers within the TCP framework: SSL Record Protocol and Stan-
dard HTTP. The SSL Record Protocol provides basic security and communications services

to the top levels of the SSL protocol stack and is responsible for the fragmentation, compres-
sion, encryption, and attachment of an SSL header to the plaintext prior to transmission.
Received encrypted messages are decrypted and reassembled for presentation to the higher
levels of the protocol. Standard HTTP provides the Internet communications services between
client and host without considering encryption of the data that is transmitted between client
and server.
S-HTTP Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) is an extended version of HTTP that provides for the
encryption of individual messages transmitted via the Internet between a client and server.
S-HTTP allows the encryption of all information passing between two computers through a
protected and secure virtual connection. Unlike SSL, in which a secure channel is established
for the duration of a session, S-HTTP is designed for sending individual messages over the
Internet; therefore, a session for each individual exchange of data must be established. To
establish a session, the client and server must have compatible cryptosystems and agree on
the configuration. The S-HTTP client and the server then agree on a session key, computed
by the server. The session key from the server is then encrypted with the client’s public key
and returned to the client. The client decrypts the key using its private key, and the client
and server now possess identical session keys, which they can use to encrypt the messages
sent between them. S-HTTP can provide confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity
through a variety of trust models and cryptographic algorithms. In addition, this protocol
is designed for easy integration with existing HTTP applications and for implementation in
conjunction with HTTP.
Securing E-mail with S/MIME and PGP
A number of cryptosystems have been adapted to work with the dominant e-mail protocols
in an attempt to incorporate some degree of security into this notoriously insecure communi-
cations medium. Some of the more popular adaptations are Secure Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions (S/MIME) and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).

S/MIME The first commonly used Internet e-mail standard was SMTP/RFC 822, also
called SMTP, but it has had problems and limitations, such as an inability to transmit exe-
cutable files and binary objects or to handle character sets other than 7-bit ASCII. These
limitations make SMTP unwieldy for organizations that need greater security and support
for international character sets. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) extends
SMTP to overcome these limitations. In Table 3-5, you can see that MIME’s message header
fields are designed to identify and describe the e-mail message and to handle a variety of
e-mail content. In addition to the message header fields, the MIME specification includes
predefined content types and conversion transfer encodings, such as 7-bit, 8-bit, binary, and
radix-64, which it uses to deliver e-mail messages reliably across a wide range of systems.
Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) builds on the encoding format of the
MIME protocol and uses digital signatures based on public-key cryptosystems to secure
e-mail; it is the second generation of enhancements to the SMTP standard. MIME and
S/MIME have the same message header fields, except for those added to support new func-
tionality. Like MIME, S/MIME uses a canonical form format, which allows it to standardize
message content type among systems, but it has the additional ability to sign, encrypt, and
decrypt messages. Table 3-6 summarizes the functions and algorithms used by S/MIME. It
should be mentioned that PGP is functionally similar to S/MIME, incorporates some of the
same algorithms, and can, to some degree, interoperate with S/MIME.

PGP Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was developed by Phil Zimmermann and is a hybrid cryp-
tosystem that combines some of the best available cryptographic algorithms and has become
the open-source de facto standard for encryption and authentication of e-mail and file stor-
age applications. Both commercial and desktop versions of PGP are available for a wide
variety of platforms. Table 3-7 lists a number of PGP functions.
PGP provides six services: authentication by digital signatures, message encryption, compres-
sion, e-mail compatibility, segmentation, and key management. As shown in Table 3-7, one of
the algorithms used in the PGP public-key encryption is Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1),
which is used to compute hash values for calculating a 160-bit hash code based on the plaintext
message. The hash code is then encrypted with DSS or RSA and appended to the original mes-
sage. The recipient uses the sender’s public key to decrypt and recover the hash code. Using the
same encryption algorithm, the recipient then generates a new hash code from the same message.
If the two hash codes are identical, the message and the sender are authentic.
A sender may also want the entire contents of the message protected from unauthorized view-
ing; 3DES, IDEA, or CAST, which are all standard algorithms, may be used to encrypt the
message contents with a unique, randomly generated 128-bit session key. The session key is
encrypted by RSA, using the recipient’s public key, then appended to the message. The recipi-
ent uses his private key with RSA to decrypt and recover the session key. The recovered ses-
sion key is used to decrypt the message. Authentication and message encryption can be used
together by first digitally signing the message with a private key, encrypting the message with
a unique session key, then encrypting the session key with the intended recipient’s public key.
In order to save space, PGP also uses the ZIP algorithm to compress the message after it has
been digitally signed but before it is encrypted. This generates a more secure encrypted docu-
ment because a smaller file offers an attacker fewer chances to look for patterns in the data
and fewer characters with which to perform frequency analysis. PGP also uses a process
known as Radix-64, which encodes nontextual data and ensures that encrypted data can be
transferred using e-mail systems by maintaining the required 8-bit blocks of ASCII text. The
format maps three octets of binary data into four ASCII characters and appends a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) to detect transmission errors.
Because many Internet facilities impose restrictions on message size, PGP can automatically
subdivide messages into a manageable stream size. This segmentation is performed after all
other encryption and conversion functions have been processed. At the recipient end, PGP
reassembles the segment’s message blocks prior to decompression and decryption. PGP does
not impose a rigid structure for public-key management, but it can assign a level of trust

within the confines of PGP, although it does not specify the actual degree of trust the user
should place in any specific key. Trust can be addressed and assured by using the public-key
ring structure. In a public-key ring structure, each specific set of public-key credentials is asso-
ciated with a key legitimacy field, a signature trust field, and an owner trust field. These fields
contain a trust-flag byte that identifies whether the credential is trusted in each of these three
fields. In the event that the trust of a given credential has been broken, as occurs when a key
is compromised, the owner can issue a digitally signed key revocation certificate that updates
the credential trust bytes when the credential is next verified.
Securing Wireless Networks with WEP and WPA
Wireless LANs (also known by the brand name Wi-Fi, or wireless fidelity networks) are
thought by many in the IT industry to be inherently insecure. The communications channel
between the wireless network interface of any computing device and the access point that
provides its services uses radio transmissions. Without some form of protection, these signals
can be intercepted by anyone with a wireless packet sniffer. In order to prevent interception
of these communications, these networks must use some form of cryptographic security con-
trol. Two sets of protocols are currently widely used to help secure wireless transmissions:
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Both are designed for
use with the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) WEP was an early attempt to provide security
with the 802.11 network protocol. It is now considered too cryptographically weak to pro-
vide any meaningful protection from eavesdropping, but for a time it did provide some mea-
sure of security for low-sensitivity networks. WEP uses the RC4 cipher stream to encrypt
each packet using a 64-bit key. This key is created using a 24-bit initialization vector and a
40-bit key value. The packets are formed using an XOR function to use the RC4 key value
stream to encrypt the data packet. A 4-byte integrity check value (ICV) is calculated for each
packet and then appended.8 According to many experts, WEP is too weak for use in most
network settings for the following reasons: 9
●
Key management is not effective because most networks use a single shared secret key
value for each node. Synchronizing key changes is a tedious process, and no key
management is defined in the protocol, so keys are seldom changed.
●
The initialization vector (IV) is too small, resulting in the recycling of IVs. An attacker
can reverse-engineer the RC4 cipher stream and decrypt subsequent packets, or can
forge future packets. In 2007, this was accomplished in less than one minute.10
In summary, an intruder who collects enough data can threaten a WEP network in just a few
minutes by decrypting or altering the data being transmitted, or by forging the WEP key to
gain unauthorized access to the network. WEP also lacks a means of validating user creden-
tials to ensure that only those who should be on the network are allowed to access it.11
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) WPA was created to resolve the issues
with WEP. WPA has a key size of 128 bits, and instead of static, seldom-changed keys it
uses dynamic keys created and shared by an authentication server. WPA accomplishes this
through the use of the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which is a suite of algo-
rithms that attempts to deliver the best security that can be obtained given the constraints

of the wireless network environment. The algorithms are designed to work with legacy net-
working devices. TKIP adds four new algorithms to those that were used in WEP:
●
A cryptographic message integrity code, or MIC, called Michael, to defeat forgeries
●
A new IV sequencing discipline, to remove replay attacks from the attacker’s arsenal
●
A per-packet key mixing function, to de-correlate the public IVs from weak keys
●
A rekeying mechanism, to provide fresh encryption and integrity keys, undoing the
threat of attacks stemming from key reuse12
Although it offered dramatically improved security over WEP, WPA was not the most secure
wireless protocol design. Some compromises were made in the security design to allow com-
patibility with existing wireless network components. Protocols to replace TKIP are currently
under development. Table 3-8 provides a summary of the differences between WEP and
WPA. In 2004, WPA2 was made available as a replacement for WPA. WPA2 provided many
of the elements missing from WPA, most notably AES-based encryption. Beginning in 2006,
WPA2 became mandatory for all new Wi-Fi devices. WPA2 is backwardly compatible with
WPA, although some older network cards have difficulty using it.
Next-Generation Wireless Protocols
Robust Secure Networks (RSN), a protocol planned as a replacement for TKIP in WPA, uses
AES along with 802.1x and EAP. It extends AES with the Counter Mode CBC MAC Protocol
(CCMP). AES supports key lengths up to 256 bits but is not compatible with older hardware.
However, a specification called Transitional Security Network (TSN) allows RSN and WEP to
coexist on the same wireless local area network (WLAN). Note, however, that a WLAN on
which devices are still using WEP is not optimally secured.
The RSN protocol functions as follows:
1.
The wireless NIC sends a probe request.
2.
The wireless access point sends a probe response with an RSN Information Exchange
(IE) frame.
3.
The wireless NIC requests authentication via one of the approved methods.

Cryptographic Tools
The ability to conceal the contents of sensitive messages and to verify the contents of messages
and the identities of their senders can be useful in all areas of business. However, to be practi-
cal to organizations, these cryptographic capabilities must be embodied in tools that allow IT
and information security practitioners to apply the elements of cryptography in the everyday
world of computing. This section discusses a number of the more widely used tools that
bring the functions of cryptography to the world of information systems.
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is an integrated system of software, encryption methodolo-
gies, protocols, legal agreements, and third-party services that enables users to communicate
securely. PKI systems are based on public-key cryptosystems and include digital certificates
and certificate authorities (CAs).
Digital certificates are public-key container files that allow computer programs to validate
the key and identify to whom it belongs. (More information about digital certificates appears
in later sections of this chapter.) PKI and the digital certificate registries they contain enable
the protection of information assets by making verifiable digital certificates readily available
to business applications. This, in turn, allows the applications to implement several of the
key characteristics of information security and to integrate these characteristics into business
processes across an organization. These processes include the following:
●
Authentication—Individuals, organizations, and Web servers can validate the identity
of each of the parties in an Internet transaction.
●
Integrity—Content signed by the certificate is known to be unaltered while being
moved from host to host or server to client.
●
Privacy—Information is protected from being intercepted during transmission.
●
Authorization—The validated identity of users and programs can enable authorization
rules that remain in place for the duration of a transaction. This reduces some of the
overhead and allows for more control of access privileges for specific transactions.
●
Nonrepudiation—Customers or partners can be held accountable for transactions,
such as online purchases, which they cannot later dispute.
A typical PKI solution protects the transmission and reception of secure information by inte-
grating the following components:
●
A certificate authority (CA), which issues, manages, authenticates, signs, and revokes
users’ digital certificates, which typically contain the user name, public key, and other
identifying information.
●
A registration authority (RA), which operates under the trusted collaboration of the
certificate authority and can handle day-to-day certification functions, such as verifying

registration information, generating end-user keys, revoking certificates, and validating
user certificates.
●
Certificate directories, which are central locations for certificate storage that provide a
single access point for administration and distribution.
●
Management protocols, which organize and manage the communications between
CAs, RAs, and end users. This includes the functions and procedures for setting up
new users, issuing keys, recovering keys, updating keys, revoking keys, and enabling
the transfer of certificates and status information among the parties involved in the
PKI’s area of authority.
●
Policies and procedures, which assist an organization in the application and manage-
ment of certificates, the formalization of legal liabilities and limitations, and actual
business use.
Common implementations of PKI include: systems to issue digital certificates to users and
servers, directory enrollment, key-issuing systems, tools for managing the key issuance, and
verification and return of certificates. These systems enable organizations to apply an
enterprise-wide solution that provides users within the PKIs area of authority the means to
engage in authenticated and secure communications and transactions.
The CA performs many housekeeping activities regarding the use of keys and certificates that
are issued and used in the zone of authority for which it is established. Each user authenticates
him or herself with the CA, and the CA can issue new or replacement keys, track issued keys,
provide a directory of public-key values for all known users, and perform other management
activities. When a private key is compromised or when the user loses the privilege of using
keys in the area of authority, the CA can revoke the user’s keys. The CA periodically distributes
a certificate revocation list (CRL) to all users. When important events occur, specific applica-
tions can make a real-time request to the CA to verify any user against the current CRL.
The issuance of certificates (and the keys inside of them) by the CA enables secure, encrypted,
nonrepudiable e-business transactions. Some applications allow users to generate their own cer-
tificates (and the keys inside them), but a key pair generated by the end user can only provide
nonrepudiation, not reliable encryption. A central system operated by a CA or RA can generate
cryptographically strong keys that are considered by all users to be independently trustworthy
and can provide services for users such as private key backup, key recovery, and key revocation.
The strength of a cryptosystem relies on both the raw strength of its key (secrecy and length)
and the overall quality of its key management security processes. PKI solutions can provide
several mechanisms for limiting access and possible exposure of the private keys. These
mechanisms
include
password
protection,
smart
cards,
hardware
tokens,
and
other
hardware-based key storage devices that are memory-capable (like flash memory or PC mem-
ory cards). PKI users should select the key security mechanisms that provide a level of key
protection appropriate to their needs. Managing the security and integrity of the private
keys used for nonrepudiation or the encryption of data files is a critical activity for all the
users of encryption and nonrepudiation services within the PKI’s area of trust.15
Digital Signatures
Digital signatures were created in response to the rising need to verify information transferred
using electronic systems. Currently, asymmetric encryption processes are used to create digital

signatures. When an asymmetric cryptographic process uses the sender’s private key to
encrypt a message, the sender’s public key must be used to decrypt the message. When the
decryption happens successfully, it provides nonrepudiation, which is the principle of cryp-
tography that underpins the authentication mechanism collectively known as a digital signa-
ture. Digital signatures are, therefore, encrypted messages that can be mathematically proven
authentic.
The management of digital signatures has been built into most Web browsers. The Internet
Explorer digital signature management screen is shown in Figure 3-11. In general, digital sig-
natures should be created using processes and products that are based on the Digital Signa-
ture Standard (DSS). When processes and products are certified as DSS compliant, it means
they have been endorsed by U.S. federal and state governments (as well as many foreign gov-
ernments) as a means of authenticating the author of an electronic document. NIST has
approved a number of algorithms that can be used to generate and verify digital signatures.
These algorithms can be used in conjunction with the sender’s public and private keys, the
receiver’s public key, and the Secure Hash Standard (described later in this chapter) to
quickly create messages that are both encrypted and nonrepudiable. This process first creates
a message digest using the hash algorithm, which is then inputted into the digital signature
algorithm along with a random number that is used to generate the digital signature. The
digital signature function also depends on the sender’s private key and other information pro-
vided by the CA. The resulting encrypted message contains the digital signature, which can
be verified by the receiver using the sender’s public key.

Digital Certificates
As you learned earlier in this chapter, a digital certificate is an electronic document or con-
tainer file that holds a key value and identifying information about the entity that controls
the key. The certificate is often issued and certified by a third party, usually a certificate
authority. A digital signature attached to the certificate’s container file certifies the file’s ori-
gin and integrity. This verification process often occurs when you download or update soft-
ware via the Internet. The pop-up window back in Figure 3-10 shows, for example, that the
downloaded files do, in fact, come from the purported originating agency, Amazon.com, and
thus can be trusted.
Unlike digital signatures, which help authenticate the origin of a message, digital certificates
authenticate the cryptographic key that is embedded in the certificate. When used properly,
these certificates enable diligent users to verify the authenticity of an organization’s certifi-
cates. This is much like what happens when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issues
its FDIC logo to banks to assure customers that their banks are authentic. Different client/
server applications use different types of digital certificates to accomplish their assigned
functions:
●
The CA application suite issues and uses certificates (keys) that identify and
establish a trust relationship with a CA to determine what additional certificates
(keys) can be authenticated.
●
Mail applications use S/MIME certificates for signing and encrypting e-mail as well
as for signing forms.
●
Development applications use object-signing certificates to identify signers of object-
oriented code and scripts.
●
Web servers and Web application servers use SSL certificates to authenticate servers
via the SSL protocol in order to establish an encrypted SSL session.
●
Web clients use client SSL certificates to authenticate users, sign forms, and participate
in single sign-on solutions via SSL.
Two popular certificate types are those created using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and those
created using applications that conform to International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU-T)
X.509 version 3. The X.509 v3 certificate, the structure for which is outlined in Table 3-9, is
an ITU-T recommendation for defining a directory service that maintains a database (also
known as a repository) of information about a group of users holding X.509 v3 certificates.
An X.509 v3 certificate binds a distinguished name (DN), which uniquely identifies a certifi-
cate entity, to a user’s public key. The certificate is signed and placed in the directory by the
CA for retrieval and verification by the user’s associated public key. The X.509 v3 standard’s
recommendation does not specify an encryption algorithm, although RSA, with its hashed
digital signature, is typically used.
Steganography
The word steganography—the art of secret writing—is derived from the Greek words stega-
nos, meaning “covered,” and graphein, meaning “to write.” The Greek historian Herodotus
described one of the first steganographers, a fellow Greek who sent a message to warn of an
imminent invasion by writing it on the wood beneath a wax writing tablet.16 Although ste-
ganography is technically not a form of cryptography, it is another way of protecting the

confidentiality of information in transit. The most popular modern version of steganogra-
phy involves hiding information within files that contain digital pictures or other images.
To understand how this form of steganography works, you must first know a little about
how images are stored. Most computer graphics standards use a combination of three color
values—red, blue, and green (RGB)—to represent a picture element, or pixel. Each of the
three color values requires an 8-bit code for that color’s intensity (e.g., 00000000 for no red
and 11111111 for maximum red). Each color image pixel therefore requires 24 bits to repre-
sent the color mix and intensity. (Actually, some image encoding standards use more or fewer
bits per pixel.) When a picture is created (by a digital camera or a computer program), the
number of horizontal and vertical pixels captured and recorded is known as the image’s reso-
lution. For example, if 1,024 horizontal pixels and 768 vertical pixels are captured and
recorded, the image has a 1024 x 768 resolution and is said to have 786,432 pixels, which
is over three-fourths of a megapixel (MP). In other words, it contains 786,432 groups of
24 bits each to represent the red, green, and blue data. The raw image size can be calculated
as 1024 x 768 x 24, or approximately 1.9 megabytes (MB). There are plenty of bits in this
picture data file in which to hide a secret message.
To the naked eye, there is no discernible difference between a pixel with a red intensity of
00101001 and another slightly different pixel with a red intensity level of 00101000. This

provides the steganographer with one bit per color (or three bits per pixel) to use for encod-
ing data into an image file. If a steganographic process uses three bits per pixel for all
786,432 pixels, it will be able to store 236 kilobytes (KB) of hidden data within the uncom-
pressed image.
Some steganographic tools can calculate the maximum size image that can be stored before
being detectable. Messages can also be hidden in nonimage computer files that do not utilize
all their available bits by placing the data in places where software ignores it and humans
almost never look. Some applications can hide messages in .bmp, .wav, .mp3, and .au files,
as well as in otherwise unused storage space on CDs and DVDs. One program can take a
text or document file and hide a message in the unused whitespace.
Even before the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. federal agencies believed that terrorist
organizations were “hiding maps and photographs of terrorist targets and posting instruc-
tions for terrorist activities on sports chat rooms, pornographic bulletin boards, and other
Web sites” by means of steganographic methods. No documented proof of this activity has
been made public.18
Attacks on Cryptosystems
Historically, attempts to gain unauthorized access to secure communications have used
brute force attacks in which the ciphertext is repeatedly searched for clues that can lead
to the algorithm’s structure. These ciphertext attacks involve a hacker searching for a com-
mon text structure, wording, or syntax in the encrypted message that can enable him or
her to calculate the number of each type of letter used in the message. This process,
known as frequency analysis, is used along with published frequency of occurrence pat-
terns of various languages and can allow an experienced attacker to crack almost any
code quickly with a large enough sample of the encoded text. To protect against this, mod-
ern algorithms attempt to remove the repetitive and predictable sequences of characters
from the ciphertext.
Occasionally, an attacker may obtain duplicate texts, one in ciphertext and one in plaintext,
and thus reverse-engineer the encryption algorithm in a known-plaintext attack scheme. Alter-
natively, attackers may conduct a selected-plaintext attack by sending potential victims a spe-
cific text that they are sure the victims will forward to others. When the victim does encrypt
and forward the message, it can be used in the attack if the attacker can acquire the outgoing
encrypted version. At the very least, reverse-engineering can usually lead the attacker to dis-
cover which cryptosystem is being employed.
Most publicly available encryption methods are released to the information and computer
security communities to test the encryption algorithm’s resistance to cracking. In addition,
attackers are kept informed of which methods of attack have failed. Although the purpose of
sharing this information is to develop a more secure algorithm, it does prevent attackers from
wasting their time, freeing them up to find new weaknesses in the cryptosystem or new, more
challenging means of obtaining encryption keys.
In general, attacks on cryptosystems fall into four general categories: man-in-the-middle,
correlation, dictionary, and timing. Although several of these attacks were discussed in
Chapter 2, they are discussed here to evaluate their impact on cryptosystems.

Man-in-the-Middle Attack
A man-in-the-middle attack, as you learned in Chapter 1, attempts to intercept a public
key or even to insert a known key structure in place of the requested public key. Thus,
attackers attempt to place themselves between the sender and receiver, and once they’ve
intercepted the request for key exchanges, they send each participant a valid public key,
which is known only to them. To the victims of such attacks, encrypted communications
appears to be occurring normally, but in fact the attacker is receiving each encrypted
message and decoding it (with the key given to the sending party), then encrypting and
sending it to the intended recipient. Establishing public keys with digital signatures can
prevent the traditional man-in-the-middle attack, as the attacker cannot duplicate the
signatures.
Correlation Attacks
As the complexity of encryption methods has increased, so too have the tools and methods
of cryptanalysts. Correlation attacks are a collection of brute force methods that attempt to
deduce statistical relationships between the structure of the unknown key and the cipher-
text generated by the cryptosystem. Differential and linear cryptanalysis, advanced meth-
ods of code breaking beyond the scope of this text, have been used to mount successful
attacks on block cipher encryptions such as DES. If these advanced approaches can calcu-
late the value of the public key, and if this can be achieved in a reasonable time, all mes-
sages written with that key can be decrypted. The only defense against this attack is the
selection of strong cryptosystems that have stood the test of time, thorough key manage-
ment, and strict adherence to the best practices of cryptography in the frequency of key
changes.
Dictionary Attacks
In a dictionary attack, the attacker encrypts every word in a dictionary by applying the same
cryptosystem as used by the target in an attempt to locate a match between the target cipher-
text and the list of encrypted words. Dictionary attacks can be successful when the ciphertext
consists of relatively few characters—for example, files that contain encrypted usernames and
passwords. An attacker who acquires a system password file can run hundreds of thousands
of potential passwords from the dictionary he or she has prepared against the stolen list.
Most computer systems use a well-known one-way hash function to store passwords in such
files, but an attacker can almost always find at least a few matches in any stolen password
file. After a match is found, the attacker has essentially identified a potential valid password
for the system.
Timing Attacks
In a timing attack, the attacker eavesdrops on the victim’s session and uses statistical analysis
of patterns and inter-keystroke timings to discern sensitive session information. Although
timing analysis may not directly result in the decryption of sensitive data, it can be used to
gain information about the encryption key and perhaps the cryptosystem. It may also elimi-
nate some algorithms, thus narrowing the attacker’s search and increasing the odds of even-
tual success. Having broken an encryption, the attacker may launch a replay attack, which is
an attempt to resubmit a recording of the deciphered authentication to gain entry into a
secure source.

Defending Against Attacks
Encryption is a very useful tool in protecting the confidentiality of information that is in
storage and/or transmission. However, it is just that—another weapon in the information
security administrator’s arsenal. Frequently, uninformed IT personnel describe information
security exclusively in terms of encryption (and possibly firewalls and antivirus software),
but encryption is simply the process of hiding the true meaning of information. Over mil-
lennia, mankind has developed dramatically more sophisticated means of hiding informa-
tion from those who should not see it, but no matter how sophisticated encryption and
cryptosystems have become, they retain the flaw that was present in the very first such sys-
tem: If you discover the key (i.e., the method used to perform the encryption), you can
read the message. Thus, key management is less the management of technology than the
management of people.
Encryption can, however, protect information when it is most vulnerable—that is, when it
is outside the organization’s systems. Information in transit through public or leased net-
works is outside the organization’s control, and with loss of control can come loss of
security. Encryption helps organizations secure information that must travel through pub-
lic and leased networks by guarding the information against the efforts of those who sniff,
spoof, and otherwise skulk around. As such, encryption is a vital piece of the security
puzzle.
Chapter Summary
■
Encryption is the process of converting a message into a form that is unreadable to
unauthorized individuals.
■
The science of encryption, known as cryptology, encompasses cryptography (making
and using encryption codes) and cryptanalysis (breaking encryption codes).
■
Cryptology has a long history and continues to change and improve.
■
Two basic processing methods are used to convert plaintext data into encrypted data:
bit stream and block ciphering. The other major methods used for scrambling data
include substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, XOR function, the Vigenère cipher,
and the Vernam cipher.
■
The strength of many encryption applications and cryptosystems is determined by key
size. All other things being equal, the longer the size of the key, the greater the
strength of the encryption.
■
Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that generate a message summary or
digest that can be used to confirm the identity of a specific message and to confirm
that the message has not been altered.
■
Most cryptographic algorithms can be grouped into two broad categories: symmetric
and asymmetric. In practice, most popular cryptosystems combine symmetric and
asymmetric algorithms.
■
IPSec and SSH provide encrypted communications for various types of networks.
SSL and S-HTTP provide encrypted communications, typically for Web sessions.
And S/MIME and PGP offer encryption for enhanced e-mail and file security.

■
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is an integrated system of software, encryption meth-
odologies, protocols, legal agreements, and third-party services that enables users to
communicate securely. PKI includes digital certificates and certificate authorities.
■
Digital signatures are encrypted messages that are independently verified by a central
facility and which provide nonrepudiation. A digital certificate is an electronic docu-
ment, similar to a digital signature, that is attached to a file to certify that the file is
from the organization it claims to be from and has not been modified from its original
format.
■
Steganography is the hiding of information, and although it is not properly a form
of cryptography, it is used to protect confidential information while in transit, as
cryptography is.
■
Unauthorized attempts to access communications often use brute force or ciphertext
attacks that perform frequency analysis on the encoded text. Therefore, modern algo-
rithms attempt to remove the repetitive and predictable statistical bias from the cipher-
text. If attackers obtain duplicate texts, one in ciphertext and one in plaintext, they
can reverse-engineer the encryption algorithm. This is referred to as a known-plaintext
attack or a selected-plaintext attack. Attacks against cryptosystems include the
man-in-the-middle attack, correlation attacks, dictionary attacks, and timing attacks.
■
Most well-known encryption methods are released to the information and computer
security communities for testing, which leads to the development of more secure
algorithms.

As security or firewall administrators, we’ve got basically the same concerns [as plumbers]:
the size of the pipe, the contents of the pipe, making sure the correct traffic is in the correct
pipes, and keeping the pipes from splitting and leaking all over the place. Of course, like
plumbers, when the pipes do leak, we’re the ones responsible for cleaning up the mess,
and we’re the ones who come up smelling awful. — Marcus J. Ranum

Introduction
No security system can provide absolute certainty that it will protect all of an organization’s
information all the time. However, firewalls—used in conjunction with other technical
controls, deployed according to the requirements of security policies and programs, and main-
tained and upgraded on a regular basis—are one of the most effective security tools a network
administrator has. Just as security policy lays the foundation for a corporate security program,
firewalls lay the foundation for network security. A firewall can effectively enforce general
security guidelines, such as disallowing audio streaming, controlling Internet access, and
providing a virtual blockade from unknown network traffic.
A firewall is not necessarily a single router, computer, VPN gateway, or software program.
Any firewall is a combination of multiple software and hardware components and is designed
for a number of crucial security tasks, such as the following:
●
Firewalls restrict traffic between networks. Whether the traffic flow originates on the
Internet and is destined for a private corporate network or the traffic flow is between
two important networks within the same company, the firewall provides a critical
blockade. Using an access control list, packet inspection, or other techniques, a firewall
ensures that only legitimate, authorized traffic can travel into or out of a network.
●
Firewalls provide a checkpoint—that is, a single point of entry or exit. As in military
planning, a checkpoint is an effective defense because all activities can be directed to
Cryptography had helped the EBS IT team solve a critical challenge by providing a
means to secure communication with one of EBS’s suppliers, Davis Office Megaplex.
Now, it was time for the team to focus on a fundamental security control that had
been in place for years: firewalls. The IT team had heard the latest security news:
cyberthreats were more likely to come from company insiders, the mobile phone
had erased the perimeter, and “click-and-own” threats were making botnets of
company computers. However, firewalls still represented a fundamental way of
protecting the company’s network traffic and were, therefore, indispensable. Like
locking the doors to the company building, there will always be a need to deter
threats, and although a firewall—like a locked door—won’t stop all attacks, it still
provides a minimum baseline for protecting the IT environment.
The EBS IT team went to work auditing the current firewall rules and reviewing
the overall firewall architecture. The team even mapped out some time to determine
whether the current technology met its goals in protecting against outside threats as
well as threats from partners like Davis Office Megaplex.

it. These activities can include monitoring network traffic for attacks or unauthorized
traffic, pursuing network security policies using one central control mechanism, or
blocking any of a number of network protocols.
●
Firewalls record network activity. In cases of abuse or intrusion, they can reveal the
who, when, and how of network traffic.
This chapter provides an overview of the issues involved in planning and designing firewalls.
First, you learn what a firewall is not so that you can begin to understand what it actually is,
then you learn about security policies and the rules and procedures that govern how a firewall
works. Next, you learn about the types of firewall protection, the limitations of firewalls, and
hardware firewall implementations. The chapter concludes with evaluations of firewall
software packages.
Firewall Overview
Most people have heard of the term “firewall,” but not in connection with computer
networks. They may know about the fireproof barrier between the engine of a car and its
interior or may have heard the term used to describe a brick wall or other fireproof barrier.
Such firewalls are intended to slow or even completely prevent the movement of a dangerous
element—specifically, fire—from passing from one side to the other.
Comparisons with physical firewalls have led to the false notion that a computer firewall is
designed to prevent all attackers, viruses, and would-be intruders from entering a computer or
computer network. Instead, firewalls are designed to simply enable authorized traffic to
pass through and block unauthorized traffic. In general, a firewall is anything, whether
hardware or software (or a combination of hardware and software), that can filter the transmis-
sion of packets of digital information as they attempt to pass through a boundary of a network.
Figure 4-1 shows a general architecture using firewalls to help establish network boundaries.

Network firewalls bear many resemblances to real-life security checkpoints, like those you
encounter in an airport:
●
Entry and exit points (called ports) are specified for different types of passengers—in
our case, network traffic. (For example, Web page content typically travels through
TCP port 80.)
●
Information that meets specified security criteria (such as an approved IP address) is
allowed to pass, whereas other data is filtered—that is, it can’t pass through freely.
●
Logging of unauthorized (as well as authorized) accesses both into and out of a
network.
In addition to these fundamental functions of a firewall, manufacturers have added a slew of
features that blur the lines between firewalls and other security devices (such as intrusion
prevention systems, or IPS). These advanced features include the following:
●
Functioning as a sort of electronic metal detector, scanning for viruses and repairing
infected files before they invade the network
●
Sending out alert messages if viruses are detected and to notify staff of break-ins
●
Providing a virtual private network (VPN) link to another network
●
Authenticating users who provide usernames and passwords so that they can be
identified and given access to the services they need
●
Shielding hosts inside the network so that attackers cannot identify them and use
them as staging areas for sustained attacks
●
Caching data so that files that are repeatedly requested can be called from the cache
to reduce the server load and improve Web site performance
●
Filtering content that is considered inappropriate (such as video streams) or dangerous
(such as mail attachments)
●
Offering all-in-one feature sets that include antivirus scanning, network intrusion
prevention, firewall technology, and other security features. This type of technology is
referred to as Unified Threat Management, or UTM.
Firewall Uses
Before you can understand how a firewall works, it is helpful to understand how firewalls are
used and applied in various situations and organizations. The following sections outline some
of the major firewall applications.
Protecting a System
For a single home user who regularly surfs the Web, exchanges e-mail, and uses instant
messaging, a firewall’s primary job is to keep viruses from infecting files and prevent Trojan
horses from entering the system through hidden openings called back doors. Most
commercial home “firewall” software—for example, Norton Internet Security, McAfee
Personal Firewall Plus, and CA Internet Security Suite—have antivirus programs that alert
users when an e-mail attachment or file containing a known virus is found.

Restricting Access to the Network
The most obvious goal of a firewall is to regulate which packets of information can enter the
network. To do so, the firewall examines each packet to determine whether it meets
the necessary “authorized” criteria. The criteria might be protocols or IP addresses on an
“approved” list. Anything not on the list is excluded. Such packet filtering is discussed in
more detail later in this chapter.
As a professional network administrator or security expert, you need to become familiar with
firewalls that function as checkpoints, protecting large companies or other organizations
from outside attackers and thieves. The firewall is positioned at the border of the network
(zone of trust), providing security for all the computers within it, so that each individual
server user or workstation does not have to provide its own security. This checkpoint
establishes a network perimeter.
A perimeter is a boundary between two zones of trust. For example, an organization’s
internal network is more trusted than the Internet, and it is common to install a firewall at
this boundary to inspect and control the traffic that flows across it, as shown in Figure 4-2.
There are additional zones of trust within the organization’s network, such as among the
Web, application, and database tiers of a three-tiered application.
Placing the firewall at the perimeter has one obvious benefit: it enables you to set up a
checkpoint where you can block attacks and malware before they pass the perimeter.
However, it has less obvious benefits, too. A perimeter firewall enables you to log
passing traffic, protecting the whole network at one time. If an attack does occur, hav-
ing defined network boundaries—especially those that include firewalls—can minimize
the damage.
A perimeter firewall also centralizes security for the organization it protects. It simplifies
the security-related activities of the network administrator, who typically has many other
responsibilities. Having a firewall on the perimeter gives the network administrator a
single location from which to configure security policies and monitor arriving and
departing traffic.

Extending the Network
If you have an extranet—an extended network that shares part of an organization’s network
with a third party (e.g., a business partner)—the location of the “perimeter” becomes a bit
murky. A firewall is an ideal endpoint for VPN, which connects two companies’ networks
over the Internet. A VPN is one of the safest ways to exchange information online. You find
out more about VPNs later in this chapter.
If the extranet operates over a VPN, the VPN should have its own perimeter firewall because
your network boundary technically extends to the end of the VPN. To be really secure, you
should install a firewall on the partner’s VPN host, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Mobile devices such as laptops, PDAs, and smartphones blur the perimeter boundary even
more because they may extend an organization’s network into Internet cafes, coffee shops,
and so forth. This, however, does not remove the need for a firewall. Firewalls become more
needed in order to extend the network but still provide necessary layers of protection for the
internal network.
Preventing Malicious Traffic from Leaving the Network
It is sometimes easier to protect a network from the Internet than from an inside attack.
Whether they are disgruntled or just ignorant of the proper security procedures, employees
can be a major source of trouble. Users inside your network could exploit security tools to
conduct attacks against other organizations or networks, or users may be duped by a spam

message to visit a malicious Web site and install malware. This malware, in turn, can
conduct attacks against other organizations from your network.
Firewalls can be configured to recognize these types of malicious attacks and prevent this
type of traffic from leaving your network. It won’t reduce the threat to your own networks,
but it will prevent the use of your systems as platforms for external attacks. A firewall can
also be configured to recognize packets or to prevent access to protected files from internal
as well as external hosts. Note, however, that remote access and social-engineering attacks
will still require that the organization make use of training and raise awareness about
security procedures.
Along with preventing traffic from leaving the network, firewalls can selectively permit traffic
to go from inside the network to the Internet or other networks to provide more precise
control of how employees inside the network use external resources. In other words, the
firewall can act as a proxy server that makes high-level application connections on behalf of
internal hosts and other systems. Application proxies can restrict internal users who want to
gain unrestricted access to the Internet. A single firewall product can provide both outbound
packet filtering (shown in Figure 4-4) and outbound proxy services.
Application proxies are control devices that can restrict internal users from unlimited access
to the Internet. Keep in mind, though, that some technically sophisticated users might be
able to circumvent the security measures you set up. They might, for instance, dial into the
office using remote access, thus opening a potential security hole. They might use a remote
access program like gotomypc.com, which provides client software that they install on both
their home and work computers. The software is configured so that every 15 or 20 seconds
the work computer sends out the query “Does anyone want to connect to me?” (The target
port is TCP port 80, the commonly used HTTP port.) Such traffic may well go through the
firewall unchecked, and it presents an obvious security risk because home networks are
seldom as well defended as corporate networks are, and attackers may be able to first attack
a user’s home network and, thus, gain access to the more valuable corporate network. Note

that some sophisticated users may use anonymizing sites that appear to be innocuous Web
servers but can allow unfettered access to anywhere else on the Internet.
Protecting Critical Resources
In order to provide true defense in depth, organizations deploy firewalls to segment networks
within an organization. This can be done to provide a tiered architecture in which Web
servers are separated by a firewall from their supporting application servers. The application
servers, in turn, are sequestered by the firewall from their supporting database servers. This
tiered architecture allows administrators to position firewalls to provide several layers of
protection for the organization’s most critical systems and resources.
Enabling an Audit Trail
Every firewall should be configured to provide information to the network administrator in
the form of log files. These log files record attempted intrusions and other suspicious activity
as well as mundane events such as legitimate file accesses, unsuccessful connection attempts,
and the like. Looking through log files is tedious, but they can help a network administrator
identify weak points in the security system so that they can be strengthened.
Log files can also identify intruders so that they can be apprehended in case theft or damage
occurs. Regular review and analysis of the log file data is what makes firewalls effective
because methods of attack change all the time. The firewall rules must be evaluated and
adjusted to account for the many new and emerging threats.
Providing for Authentication
You are probably familiar with authentication—the process of logging in to a server with
credentials before being allowed access to protected information. Only users who have
registered credentials are recognized by the server and allowed to enter. The authentication
process can also be performed at the firewall and make use of encryption to protect
credentials transmitted from client to server (or client to firewall).
How Do Firewalls Work?
In this section, we discuss the various features of firewalls and the ways they work. Firewalls
perform two basic security functions:
●
Packet filter—First and foremost, a firewall must be able to determine whether to
allow or deny the passage of packets of digital information, based on established
security policy rules.
●
Application proxy—In some cases, a firewall may provide network services to users
while shielding individual host computers. This is done by breaking the IP flow (i.e.,
the traffic into and out of the network) between the network being protected and the
network outside.
Firewalls can be complex, but if you thoroughly understand only these two functions, you’ll
make a lot of progress toward being able to choose the right firewall and configure it to
protect a computer or network.

Firewalls work at many levels of the seven-layer OSI networking model, which is one reason
they’re so effective. Table 4-1 provides examples of firewall functions and the corresponding
layers at which they operate.
Protocols
Firewalls affect the transmission of packets based on the protocols used. You, therefore, need
to understand how the various Internet protocols function. Here are brief descriptions:
●
Internet Protocol (IP)—The rules used for all parts of the IP protocol control the
overall flow of IP traffic through your network. If you have identified a computer or
network that you want to block from your company’s network, you would specify
Source IP or Destination IP rule criteria. These rules will affect the entire TCP/IP suite
of protocols (ICMP, UDP, or TCP).
●
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)—IP, by itself, has no way of letting the
host that originated a request know whether a packet was received at its destination
in its entirety. It can, however, use ICMP to report any errors that occurred in the
transmission. Utilities such as Ping and Traceroute use ICMP. The danger is that
ICMP packets can be filled with false information that can trick your hosts into
redirecting or stopping communications.
●
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)—This protocol further handles the addressing of a
message. UDP breaks a message into numbered segments so that it can be
transmitted. UDP then reassembles the message when it reaches the destination
computer. UDP is connectionless; it simply sends segments of messages without
performing error-checking or waiting for an acknowledgment that the message has
been received. Such a protocol is useful for video and audio broadcasts on the
Internet. TCP and UDP are often mentioned together in discussions of firewalls
because both transmit data through ports and thus open up vulnerabilities. It’s
useful to set up rules to block UDP traffic on ports 21 and below and to block
traffic on ports that control hardware such as keyboards, hubs, and routers; see
Chapter 2 for more information.

●
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)—The rules used to control filtering of TCP packets
are similar to those used for UDP packets. For example, you should block packets
that use ports below 20, and you can block specific protocols—for example, Telnet
connections on port 23. Unlike UDP, however, TCP provides connections for error
checking and for ensuring that transmissions have been sent and received successfully.
Ports
UDP and TCP ports work like apartment numbers in that they allow many network services to
share a network address. Tenants in an apartment building have their own apartment numbers
but share a street address; likewise, network services have their own port numbers but share a
network address. To send a specific letter to a specific tenant, a sender would address the
envelope with the street and the apartment number. The sender then adds her own address to
the envelope, including the apartment number at her own building. This combination of a
sender’s full address (network address plus port) and receiver’s address (network address plus
port) makes up what is called a socket. To initiate a connection to a network service, the sender
specifies both his IP address and port number and the recipient’s IP address and port number.
A port is a network subaddress (assigned a number between 0 and 65,535) through which a
particular type of data is allowed to pass. There are two types of ports: well-known ports
(those numbered at 1023 and below) and ephemeral ports (those numbered from 1024
through 65535). Well-known ports are defined for most common services—the Web (port 80),
SSH (port 22), Simple Mail Transport Protocol (port 25), POP Mail (port 110), and many
others. Ephemeral port numbers are dynamically assigned as needed and have no special
meaning outside the connection using them.
So, for example, when a user requests a connection to a Web server running at address
192.168.5.203, the Web browser would know to attempt the connection at port 80. Exposed
network services—such as an unplanned mail server running on a corporate Web server—are
one of the biggest vulnerabilities that firewalls can protect against. A firewall can block
external access to such unplanned services so that, for example, mail server connection
requests are always routed to the actual mail server and not to any other system that may
have inadvertently set up a mail server.
Packet filtering, which virtually all firewalls do, protects networks from
port scanning and other types of attacks. In a port scanning attack,
special software scans a series of network addresses, attempting to
connect to each one. If a connection is made, it gives the attacker a
target. A properly configured firewall only allows authorized connection
attempts to the ports on the network it protects.
Packet-Filtering Firewalls
Packet filtering is a key function of any firewall. In fact, packet filters were one of the first
types of firewalls. Packet filters are an effective element in any perimeter security setup.
As you learned in Chapter 2, at the Physical layer, data is referred to as a bit stream. At the
Data Link layer, the bit stream is encapsulated in a frame. At the Network layer, frames are
used to encapsulate packets (or datagrams). Both the frame and the packet contain two types
of information:

●
The header, which consists of general information about the size of the packet, the
protocol that was used to send it, and the IP addresses of the source computer and
the destination.
●
The data, which is the information you view and use—for example, the text of an
e-mail message, the contents of a Web page, a piece of a file being transferred, or the
bits of a digital photograph. The data of a packet also includes the Data Link layer
frame in its entirety.
●
A frame also includes a trailer (or footer) at its end, after the data field. The trailer
can contain error-checking data.
A packet-filtering firewall installed on a TCP/IP-based network typically functions at the
IP level and determines whether to alert the sender that a packet will not be delivered (reject),
ignore a packet (drop), or forward it to the next network connection (allow) based on the
rules programmed into the firewall. Packet-filtering firewalls examine every incoming packet
header and can selectively filter packets based on header information such as destination
address, source address, packet type, and other key information. Figure 4-5 shows the
general structure of an IPv4 packet.
Packet-Filtering Rules Simple firewall models examine two components of the packet
header: the destination address and the source address. They enforce address restrictions
rules and prohibit packets with specific addresses or incomplete addresses from passing

through the device. These restrictions are defined in access control lists (ACLs), or firewall
rules, which are created and modified by the firewall administrators. Typically, a rule
specifies a protocol (such as ICMP, UDP, or HTTP), the IP address or address range, the
TCP or UDP ports, and the desired firewall action.
To better understand firewall rules, consider Table 4-2. If an administrator were to configure
three firewall rules based on the content of Table 4-2, any connection from an external
computer or network device would be denied access to systems in the 10.10.x.x address range
(10.10.0.0–10.10.255.255) unless they were communicating over HTTP to 10.10.10.25 or
over FTP to 10.10.10.10.
Note that the order of the rules is very important. Rules are executed in order, and later rules
can override a previous rule. Therefore, a best practice is to start with the rule to drop all
incoming traffic; this blocks all traffic and then adds back specific ports or programs to
achieve the functionality that is needed. The subsequent rules identify the specific types of
communication you want to permit. The allowances may be based on a specific program
being executed, a precise time of day, a specific port, a known IP address, or other specific
criteria.
Packet-Filtering Best Practices The following list outlines some best practices in set-
ting up the packet-filtering rules:
●
Any outbound packet must have a source address that is in your internal network.
●
Any outbound packet must not have a destination address that is in your internal
network.
●
Any inbound packet must not have a source address that is in your internal network.
●
Any inbound packet must have a destination address that is in your internal network.
●
Any packet that enters or leaves your network must have a source or destination
address that falls within the range of addresses in your network. Your network may
use (but does not have to use) private addresses or addresses listed in RFC1918.
These include 10.x.x.x/8, 172.16.x.x/12, or 192.168.x.x/16 as well as the loopback
network 127.0.0.0/8.
●
All traffic from the trusted network is filtered. This allows members of the organization
to access the services they need but prevents botnet behaviors or other internal threats
from affecting other Internet denizens. Filtering and logging outbound traffic is possible
when indicated by specific organizational policy goals. However, when the organization

wants to control outbound traffic, a separate firewall is used to minimize the load on the
inbound firewall.
●
The firewall device should never be managed or configured directly from the public
network. Almost all management access to the firewall device is denied to internal
users as well. Only authorized firewall administrators access the device via secure
authentication mechanisms, with preference for a method based on cryptographically
strong authentication using two-factor access control techniques.
●
All inbound traffic that is not a response to an outbound request is routed to the
appropriate, well-configured server or it is dropped. For example, Simple Mail
Transport Protocol (SMTP) data is allowed to pass through the firewall, but all of it is
routed to a well-configured SMTP gateway to filter and route messaging traffic
securely. Web services are only allowed to go to either the Web or e-commerce servers
or (as described in the next guideline) to a proxy server.
●
When Web services are offered outside the firewall, HTTP traffic is prevented from
reaching your internal networks via the implementation of some form of proxy access
or DMZ architecture. That way, if any employees are running Web servers for
internal use on their desktops, the services will be invisible to the outside Internet.
●
If your Web server is located behind the firewall, you need to allow HTTP or HTTPS
(S-HTTP) data through for the Internet at large to view it. The best solution is to
place the Web servers containing critical data inside the network and to use proxy
services from a DMZ (screened network segment).
●
It is also advisable to restrict incoming HTTP traffic to internal network
addresses so that the traffic must be responding to requests originating at internal
addresses. This restriction can be accomplished through NAT or firewalls that
support stateful inspection or are directed at the proxy server itself. All other
incoming HTTP traffic should be blocked. If the Web servers contain only
advertising (static Web pages), they should be placed in the DMZ and rebuilt if
and when they are compromised.
●
All ICMP data is denied. Known as the ping service, use of ICMP traffic is a common
method for hacker reconnaissance and should be turned off to prevent snooping.
●
Access to all network communication services that are not explicitly required is
blocked. If internal users need to reach an organization’s network that is outside the
firewall, use a virtual private network (VPN) client or other secure authentication
system to allow this kind of access.
●
Eliminate packets bound for all ports that should not be available to the Internet, such
as NetBIOS, but allow Internet-related traffic, such as SMTP, to pass.
●
Drop all packets that use the IP header source routing feature. In IP source routing,
the originator of a packet can attempt to partially or completely control the path
through the network to the destination. Source routing is widely considered a suspect
activity from a security standpoint because this is a favorite technique of network
attackers; few legitimate uses exist for this kind of route control.
●
Drop all other inbound connections; allow only outbound connections on port 80
(HTTP), port 443 (HTTPS), and port 25 (SMTP) unless users can demonstrate a
business need to access other protocols.

Stateless Packet-Filtering Firewalls Stateless inspection, also called stateless packet
filtering, is firewall packet inspection that ignores the state of the connection between the
internal computer and the external computer. A firewall that conducts stateless packet-
filtering blocks or allows a packet based on the information in the header.
Static packet-filtering firewalls scan network data packets looking for compliance with, or
violation of, the rules of the firewall’s database. Filtering firewalls inspect packets at the
Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. If the device finds a packet that violates a rule, it
stops the packet from traveling from one network to another. The restriction criteria most
commonly implemented in packet-filtering firewalls are based on a combination of the following:
●
IP source and destination address
●
Direction (inbound or outbound)
●
TCP or UDP source and destination port
●
ICMP message types and codes
Packet structure varies, depending on the nature of the packet. The server that receives the
packet makes use of the details of its packet structure when it processes the packet. The two
primary service types are TCP and UDP. Figures 4-6 and 4-7 show the structures of these
two major elements of the combined protocol known as TCP/IP.
Packet-Filtering Router The ability to restrict a specific service is now standard in
most routers and is invisible to the user. Unfortunately, such routers are unable to detect
whether packet headers have been modified, which occurs in some advanced attack meth-
ods, including IP spoofing attacks. IP spoofing is the falsification of the source IP address in
a packet’s header so that it appears to have come from a trusted or legitimate sender. In
some cases, attackers spoof using a source IP address that belongs to the target in order to
make it look as though the packet is coming from a computer within the organization.

Figure 4-8 shows how a packet-filtering router can be used as a simple firewall to filter data
packets from inbound connections and allow outbound connections unrestricted access to the
public network.
Stateful Packet-Filtering Firewalls Stateful inspection, also called stateful packet
filtering, is an examination of the data contained in a packet as well as the state of the
connection between internal and external computers. This information, known as the state
table, is kept in a memory location called the cache. Stateful inspection is superior to
stateless inspection because it uses the connection state to make decisions on whether to
allow the traffic. A state table tracks the state and context of each packet in the conversa-
tion by recording which station sent what packet and when. Whereas simple packet-
filtering firewalls allow or deny certain packets based only on their addresses, stateful packet
filtering can allow incoming packets that have been sent in response to internal requests. If
the stateful firewall receives an incoming packet that it cannot match in its state table, it
defaults to its ACL to determine whether to allow the packet to pass.
The primary disadvantage of this type of firewall is the additional processing required to
manage packets and verify them against the state table, which can leave the system vulnerable
to a DoS or DDoS attack. In such an attack, the system receives a large number of external

packets, which slows down the firewall because it attempts to compare all the incoming pack-
ets first to the state table and then to the ACL.
On the positive side, these firewalls can track connectionless packet traffic, such as UDP and
remote procedure calls (RPCs) traffic. Dynamic stateful-filtering firewalls maintain a dynamic
state table, making changes (within predefined limits) to the filtering rules based on events as
they happen.
A sample state table is shown in Table 4-3. The state table contains the source IP and port,
the destination IP and port, information on the protocol used (i.e., UDP or TCP), the total
time (in seconds), and the time remaining (in seconds). Many state table implementations
allow a connection to remain in place for up to 60 minutes without any activity before the
state entry is deleted. The state table shown in Table 4-3 shows this in the column labeled
“Total Time.” The Time Remaining column shows a countdown of the time that is left until
the entry is deleted.
Stateful inspection also blocks packets that are sent from an external computer that does not
have a currently active connection to an internal computer.
Application-Level Gateways
Another type of firewall protection is the application-level gateway, also known as a proxy
server. An application-level gateway works at the Application layer, the top layer of the OSI
model of network communications, as described in Chapter 2. This level of functionality allows
the firewall to act as a intermediary between two systems that wish to communicate.1
The application-level gateway runs special software that enables it to act as a proxy for a
specific service request. For example, an organization that runs a Web server can avoid
exposing the server to direct user traffic by installing such a proxy server, configured with
the registered domain’s URL. This proxy server receives requests for Web pages, accesses the
Web server on behalf of the external client, and returns the requested pages to the users.
These servers can store the most recently accessed pages in their internal cache, which is
why they are also called “cache servers.”
By setting up a proxy service, an application-level gateway can control the way applications
inside the network access external networks. The proxy service acts as a substitute for the client,
making requests for Web pages or sending and receiving e-mail on behalf of individual users
who are thus shielded from directly connecting with the Internet. This shielding minimizes the
effect of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other malware.
The benefits of using an application-level gateway are significant. For one, the gateway is placed
in an unsecured area of the network or in the demilitarized zone (DMZ)—an intermediate area

between a trusted network and an untrusted network—so that it, rather than the Web server, is
exposed to the higher levels of risk from the less-trusted networks. Additional filtering routers
can be implemented behind the gateway, limiting access to the more secure internal system and
thereby further protecting internal systems.
One common example of an application-level gateway implementation is a firewall that
blocks all requests for and responses to requests for Web pages and services from the
organization’s internal computers and instead makes all such requests and responses go to
intermediate computers (or proxies) in the less-protected areas of the organization’s network.
This technique is still widely used to implement e-commerce functions, although most users
of this technology have upgraded to take advantage of the DMZ approach.
The primary disadvantage of application-level gateways is that they are designed for a
specific protocol and cannot easily be reconfigured to protect against attacks on other pro-
tocols. Because application-level gateways work at the Application layer (hence the name),
they are typically restricted to a single application (e.g., FTP, Telnet, HTTP, SMTP, or
SNMP). The processing time and resources necessary to read each packet down to the
Application layer diminish the ability of these firewalls to handle multiple types of
applications.
An application-level gateway provides you with one especially valuable security benefit.
Unlike a packet filter, which decides whether to allow or deny a request based on the infor-
mation contained in the packet header, the gateway understands the contents of the
requested data. It can be configured to allow or deny (both of which actions can be taken as
a result of filtering) specific content, such as viruses and executables.
Content filtering is only one of the tasks that application-level gateways perform that give
them the edge over merely blocking specified IP addresses. Among the other tasks are:
●
Load balancing—If an airport security checkpoint has not one but two secure
entrances, the number of people passing through each can be reduced substantially.
In the same way, large organizations commonly install more than one firewall and
divide the traffic load between them.
●
IP address mapping—This is a type of NAT in which a static IP address assigned by
an ISP is mapped to the private IP address of a computer on the local network; it is
sometimes called “address vectoring” or “static IP mapping.” The benefit to an
internal network is that it shields actual internal IP addresses from the prying eyes of
unauthorized external clients.
●
Filtering specific content—An application proxy server can be set up to filter on
specific criteria. You can block files that have a certain filename or part of a filename,
a keyword, an e-mail attachment, or a content type.
●
URL filtering—This can be used to block a site’s Domain Name System (DNS) name,
such as www.criminalactivity.com.
●
Fragmentation attack prevention—A natural feature of IP communication allows
packets to be split (i.e., fragmented) prior to sending to allow for the transmission of
large packets of data. The recipient then uses the information to reassemble the
packets upon receipt. Attacks like Tiny Fragment and Overlapping Fragment2 abuse

this IP routing feature to carry out actions. An application-level gateway can prevent
these attacks because it reassembles packets, discards those that are malformed, and
sends only valid packets to the client.
Multi-Layer Filtering
Larger organizations use multiple firewall technologies in a DMZ perimeter security setup.
They might use a router that functions as a static packet filter, a stateful packet filter that
has been set up in a bastion host, and firewall software, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Additionally, firewalls were dedicated to one specific type of technology, with each appliance
serving as either a packet-filtering firewall, stateful packet-filtering firewall, or an application-
level gateway. Modern advances in firewall technologies now allow a firewall to serve as a
true hybrid device, performing stateful packet inspection with the option of conducting more
detailed analysis down into the Application layer on demand.
This detailed analysis is referred to as deep packet inspection. Deep packet inspection
combines stateful packet filtering with the ability to analyze Application-layer protocols used
in communication and determine if there are any inconsistencies, deviations, or malformed
packets. Firewalls with this ability are called application firewalls.3
Deep packet inspection is implemented through the use of jump rules. Jump rules enable
the firewall (when certain conditions are met) to execute a separate set of rules that exam-
ines the packet in question in much greater detail. Jump rules work the same way as
nested programming code, in which the program flows until a specified condition is met.
Once that condition is met, the device pulls up a separate, referenced set of code and fol-
lows its instructions.
A simple example is provided by modern Web pages using HTML. When you read a Web
page, you find links to other pages. These links bring up additional content referred to in
the master page. This linking allows each section of code—or, in the case of firewalls, each

rule set—to be managed independently, keeping the master set of rules much neater and
better organized. The administrator can also assign responsibility for maintenance of
the subsets to different individuals or departments, increasing the efficiency of firewall
management.
Multi-layer filtering does have its disadvantages. Every time the jump rule is triggered, it
slows down the processing of that packet. However, with the advances in modern computing
technology, this is no longer dramatic enough to overcome the advantages of being able to
determine if a particular packet carries a substantial threat. Before multi-layer filtering was
available, two or more different devices were required to perform this function: a core
packet-filtering (or stateful packet-filtering) firewall to perform base analysis and a separate
application-level gateway to handle the examination of each higher-level protocol. Now, one
firewall device can do the work of many.
Circuit-Level Gateways
Another approach, the circuit-level gateway, operates at the Transport layer and is dif-
ferent from both packet-filtering firewalls and application-level gateways. Connections
are authorized based on addresses. Like filtering firewalls, circuit gateway firewalls do
not usually examine traffic flowing between one network and another, but they do
prevent direct connections between one network and another. They accomplish this by
creating tunnels connecting specific processes or systems on each side of the firewall
and then allowing only authorized traffic, such as a specific type of TCP connection
for authorized users, in these tunnels. A circuit gateway is a firewall component often
included in the category of application gateway, but it is in fact a separate type of fire-
wall. Writing for NIST in SP 800-10, John Wack describes the operation of a circuit
gateway as follows:
A circuit-level gateway relays TCP connections but does no extra processing or
filtering of the protocol. For example, the TELNET application gateway example
provided here would be an example of a circuit-level gateway, since once the
connection between the source and destination is established, the firewall simply
passes bytes between the systems. Another example of a circuit-level gateway
would be for NNTP, in which the NNTP server would connect to the firewall,
and then internal systems’ NNTP clients would connect to the firewall. The fire-
wall would, again, simply pass bytes.4
Although not as well known or widely referenced as the firewall approaches discussed
previously, MAC layer firewalls are designed to operate at the media access control sub-
layer of the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI network model. This enables these firewalls
to consider the specific host computer’s identity, as represented by its MAC or network inter-
face card (NIC) address, in its filtering decisions. Using this approach, the MAC addresses of
specific host computers are linked to ACL entries that identify the specific types of packets
that can be sent to each host, and all other traffic is blocked.
Figure 4-10 shows where in the OSI model each of the firewall processing modes
inspects data.

Firewall Form Factors
Firewalls can be categorized by generations or by form factor. Technologically, firewalls are
categorized into generations, the later generations being more recently developed and more
complex. However, there is no standard definition of which generation refers to which type
of firewall. Additionally, the advanced features of modern firewalls cause “blurring” of
which firewalls fit into which generation.
Instead, in this text, we will categorize firewalls by form factor. This type of categorization
refers to whether a firewall is a residential-grade or commercial-grade, hardware-based or
software-based, or appliance-based device.
Most commercial-grade firewalls are dedicated appliances—stand-alone units running on fully
customized computing platforms that provide both the physical network connection and
firmware programming necessary to perform their functions. Some use highly customized,
sometimes proprietary hardware systems that are developed exclusively as firewall devices.
Others are off-the-shelf, general-purpose computer systems that use custom application
software running on either standard operating systems like Windows or Linux/UNIX or on
specialized variants of these operating systems. Most small-office or residential-grade firewalls
are either simplified dedicated appliances running on computing devices or application
software installed directly on the user’s computer.
Firewall Appliances
Firewall appliances are stand-alone, self-contained combinations of computing hardware and
software. These devices frequently have many of the features of a general-purpose computer
with the addition of firmware-based instructions that increase their reliability and perfor-
mance and minimize the likelihood of their being compromised. The customized software
operating system that drives the device can be periodically upgraded but can only be
modified by using a direct physical connection or by using extensive authentication and
authorization protocols. The firewall rule sets are stored in non-volatile memory, and thus

they can be changed by technical staff when necessary but are available each time the device
is restarted.
These appliances may be manufactured from stripped-down, general-purpose computer
systems, and/or they can be designed to run a customized version of a general-purpose oper-
ating system. These variant operating systems are tuned to meet the type of firewall activity
built into the application software that provides the firewall functionality. Examples of the
current firewall appliances include:5

Firewall Systems A commercial-grade firewall system consists of application software
that is configured for the firewall application and runs on a general-purpose computer.
Organizations can install firewall software on an existing general-purpose computer system,
or they can purchase hardware that has been configured to specifications that yield optimum
firewall performance. These systems exploit the fact that firewalls are essentially application
software packages that use common general-purpose network connections to move data from
one network to another. Full-featured, commercial-grade firewall packages include:

Virtual Firewalls With the widespread adoption of virtualized server environments or
cloud-based infrastructures, more and more enterprise systems exist as virtual systems. To pro-
tect these virtual systems, a variety of virtualized firewalls have been introduced. A virtual fire-
wall has the same features and functions of its physical brethren but is built on a virtual server
or is implemented as a virtual security appliance. The virtual security appliance is similar to the
firewall appliance in that the firewall is bundled with a hardened operating system and virtua-
lized hardware.6 As its name implies, the virtual server option is similar to a firewall system,
but the firewall software is installed on a virtual server. Examples of virtual firewalls include:7

Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Firewall Appliances Most small busi-
nesses and residences have fast Internet connections. Therefore, they are more vulnerable to
attacks. What many small-business and work-from-home users don’t realize is that these
high-speed services are always on; thus, the computers connected to them are more visible
to the scans performed by attackers. Coupled with the typically lax security configured by
users on systems running modern home computing operating systems, these systems are
vulnerable to outside intrusion.

Newer operating systems such as Windows 7 and Mac OS X have improved security “out
of the box,” but users can still benefit from having solid SOHO networking security in
place. Just as organizations must protect their information, residential users must implement
some form of firewall to prevent loss, damage, or disclosure of personal information.
One of the most effective methods for improving computing security in the SOHO setting is
using a SOHO or residential-grade firewall. These devices, also known as broadband
gateways or DSL/cable modem routers, connect the user’s local area network (LAN) or a
specific computer system to the Internet working device—in this case, the cable modem or
DSL router provided by the Internet service provider (ISP). The SOHO firewall serves first
as a stateful firewall to enable inside-to-outside access and can be configured to allow lim-
ited TCP/IP port forwarding and/or screened subnet capabilities (see the later sections of
this chapter for definitions of these terms).
In recent years, the broadband router devices that can function as packet-filtering firewalls
have been enhanced to combine the features of wireless access points (WAPs) and small
stackable LAN switches in a single device. These convenient combination devices give the
residential/SOHO user the strong protection that comes from the use of NAT services. NAT
assigns nonrouting local addresses to the computer systems in the LAN and uses the single
ISP-assigned address to communicate with the Internet. Because the internal computers are
not visible to the public network, they are much less likely to be scanned or compromised.
Many users implement these devices primarily to allow multiple internal users to share a
single external Internet connection. Figure 4-11 shows a few examples of the SOHO firewall
devices currently available on the market.

Many of these firewalls provide more than simple NAT services. As illustrated by the
screenshots in Figures 4-12 through 4-16, some SOHO/residential firewalls include packet-
filtering, port-filtering, and simple intrusion detection systems, and some can even restrict access
to specific MAC addresses. Users may be able to configure port forwarding and enable outside
users to access specific TCP or UDP ports on specific computers on the protected network.
Figure 4-12 shows the MAC Address filter setup screen from the SMC Barricade residential
broadband router, which can be used to identify the computers inside a trusted network that
may access the Internet.
Some firewall devices provide a limited intrusion detection capability. Figure 4-13 shows the con-
figuration screen from the SMC Barricade residential broadband router that enables the intru-
sion detection feature. When enabled, this feature detects specific intrusion attempts that are
defined in the currently installed detection library—that is, attempts to compromise the protected
network that are known to the device manufacturer and are detectable based on the nature of
the attack. In addition to recording intrusion attempts, the router can be configured to use the
contact information to notify the firewall administrator when an intrusion attempt occurs.

Figure 4-14 shows a continuation of the configuration screen for the intrusion detection
feature. Note that the intrusion criteria are limited in number but that the actual threshold
levels of the various activities detected can be customized by the administrator.
Figure 4-15 illustrates that even simple residential firewalls can be used to create a logical
screened subnetwork (often called a DMZ) that can provide Web services. This screen shows
how the Barricade can be configured to allow port forwarding to be established so that Inter-
net users can be allowed access to servers inside the trusted network for services at specific
port numbers. The network administrator is expected to ensure that the exposed servers are
sufficiently secured for this type of exposure.
Firewall Software Many people have installed software firewalls on the systems they
use. Firewall software looks at network communication to and from the system on which
it’s installed. This specific focus on a single system gives the system operator a greater degree
of granularity in specifying what applications are allowed to communicate as well as
determining which users can interact with the system. Additionally, these firewalls are more

Software vs. Hardware: The SOHO Firewall Debate Should a residential user
implement a software-based firewall or a hardware-based firewall? Look at it this way:
When would you rather defend against an attacker? If you use a software-based firewall,
the attacker is inside your computer, battling a piece of software (free software, in some
cases) that may not have been correctly installed, configured, patched, upgraded, or
designed. If the software happens to have a known vulnerability, the attacker can bypass
the software and gain unrestricted access to your system.

If you use a hardware-based firewall, even if the attacker manages to crash the firewall
system, your computer and information are still safely behind the now-disabled connection,
which is assigned a nonroutable IP address, making it virtually impossible to reach from the
outside. A former student of one of the authors responded to this debate by installing a hard-
ware firewall, then visiting an attacker chat room. He challenged the group to penetrate his
system. A few days later, he received an e-mail from an attacker claiming to have accessed
his system. The attacker included a graphic of a screen showing a C:\ prompt, which he
claimed was from the student’s system. After doing a bit of research, the student found out
that the firewall had an image stored in firmware that was designed to distract attackers. It
was an image of a command window with a DOS prompt. The hardware (NAT) solution
had withstood the challenge.
There are, however, a number of recent attacks taking place against home routers and fire-
walls in which the administrator password is compromised or software vulnerability is
exploited.9 Whether a hardware-based firewall or a software-based firewall is used, you must
choose difficult admin passwords, harden the systems, and continue to update software as
new vulnerabilities are discovered.

Free Firewall Tools on the Internet Most of the free firewall software available on
the Internet (including the packet-filter ipchains, iptables, and TIS Firewall Toolkit) also run
on a free operating system (such as Linux, the Berkeley Software Design variety of UNIX
(BSD), or DOS).
Free firewall programs aren’t perfect. Their logging capabilities aren’t as robust as some
commercial products, they can be difficult to configure, and they usually don’t include a way
to monitor the firewall in real time. Nonetheless, they have a place in networking because of
their convenience, simplicity, and unbeatable price.
Examples of free firewall products include:
●
Windows Firewall—Starting with Windows XP SP2, the current versions of Microsoft
Windows operating systems include the Windows Firewall. Early versions only allowed
for blocking incoming traffic, but since Windows Vista, outgoing traffic is also filtered.10
●
Application Firewall—Apple Mac OS X 10.5 and later includes the Application
Firewall that allows users to filter traffic on a per-application basis.11
●
Netfilter and iptables—Netfilter and iptables comes with the Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
and is a powerful solution for stateless and stateful packet filtering, NAT, and packet
processing.12 Netfilter doesn’t have all the features of commercial programs such as
VPN, but it does one thing very well: logging. Netfilter records copious information
about the traffic that passes through it, but that information is well organized and
easy to review.
●
ZoneAlarm Free Firewall—ZoneAlarm offers a free firewall that provides basic ingress
and egress filtering. ZoneAlarm provides a full security suite via the for-sale version.
Firewall Architectures
Each of the firewall devices described earlier can be configured in a number of network
connection architectures. These approaches are sometimes mutually exclusive and sometimes
can be combined.
The configuration that works best for a particular organization depends on three factors: the
objectives of the network, the organization’s ability to develop and implement the architec-
tures, and the budget available for the function. Although hundreds of variations exist, there
are four common architectural implementations of firewalls. These implementations are
packet-filtering routers, screened host firewalls, dual-homed firewalls, and screened subnet
firewalls. Each of these is examined in more detail in the following sections.
Packet-Filtering Routers
Most organizations with an Internet connection have some form of router at the perimeter,
between the organization’s internal networks and the external service provider. Many of
these routers can be configured to reject packets that the organization does not allow into
the network. This is a simple but effective way to lower the organization’s risk from external
attack. The drawbacks to this type of system include a lack of auditing and a lack of strong
authentication. Also, the complexity of the ACLs used to filter the packets can degrade
network performance.

Screened Host Firewalls
Screened host firewalls combine the packet-filtering router with a separate, dedicated firewall,
such as an application proxy server. This approach allows the router to prescreen packets to
minimize the network traffic and load on the internal proxy. The application proxy examines
an Application layer protocol, such as HTTP, and performs the proxy services. This separate
host is often referred to as a bastion host; it can be a rich target for external attacks and
should be very thoroughly secured.
Even though the bastion host/application proxy actually contains only cached copies of the
internal Web documents, it can still present a promising target, because compromise of the
bastion host can disclose the configuration of internal networks and possibly provide external
sources with internal information. Because the bastion host stands as a sole defender on the
network perimeter, it is also commonly referred to as the sacrificial host. To its advantage,
this configuration requires the external attack to compromise two separate systems before
the attack can access internal data. In this way, the bastion host protects the data more fully
than the router alone. Figure 4-16 shows a typical configuration of a screened host
architecture.
Dual-Homed Host Firewalls
The next step up in firewall architectural complexity is the dual-homed host. When this
architectural approach is used, the bastion host contains two NICs rather than one, as in
the bastion host configuration. One NIC is connected to the external network, and one is
connected to the internal network, providing an additional layer of protection. With two
NICs, all traffic must physically go through the firewall to move between the internal and
external networks. This architecture often makes use of NAT—mapping real, valid,
external IP addresses to special ranges of nonroutable internal IP addresses—thereby cre-
ating yet another barrier to intrusion from external attackers. If the NAT server is a
multi-homed bastion host, it translates between the true, external IP addresses assigned

to the organization by public network naming authorities and the internally assigned,
nonroutable IP addresses. NAT translates by dynamically assigning addresses to internal
communications and tracking the conversations with sessions to determine which
incoming message is a response to which outgoing traffic. Figure 4-17 shows a typical
configuration of a dual-homed host firewall that uses NAT and proxy access to protect
the internal network.
Another benefit of a dual-homed host is its ability to translate many different protocols
at their respective Data Link layers, including Ethernet, Token Ring, Fiber Distributed
Data Interface (FDDI), and Asynchronous Transfer Method (ATM). On the downside,
if this dual-homed host is compromised, it can disable the connection to the external
network, and as traffic volume increases, it can become overloaded. Compared to more
complex solutions, however, this architecture provides strong overall protection with
minimal expense.
Screened Subnet Firewalls (with DMZ)
The dominant architecture used today is the screened subnet firewall. The architecture of a
screened subnet firewall provides a DMZ. The DMZ can be a dedicated port on the firewall
device linking a single bastion host, or it can be connected to a screened subnet, as shown in
Figure 4-18. Until recently, servers providing services through an untrusted network were
commonly placed in the DMZ. Examples of these include Web servers, File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) servers, and certain database servers. More recent strategies using proxy servers have
provided much more secure solutions.
A common arrangement is a subnet firewall consisting of two or more internal bastion hosts
behind a packet-filtering router, with each host protecting the trusted network. There are
many variants of the screened subnet architecture. The first general model consists of two
filtering routers, with one or more dual-homed bastion hosts between them. In the second
general model, the connections are routed as follows:

●
Connections from the outside or untrusted network are routed through an external
filtering router.
●
Connections from the outside or untrusted network are routed into—and then out
of—a routing firewall to the separate network segment known as the DMZ.
●
Connections into the trusted internal network are allowed only from the DMZ
bastion host servers.
The screened subnet is an entire network segment that performs two functions: it protects the
DMZ systems and information from outside threats by providing a network of intermediate
security (more secure than the general public networks but less secure than the internal net-
work), and it protects the internal networks by limiting how external connections can gain
access to them. Though extremely secure, the screened subnet can be expensive to implement
and complex to configure and manage. The value of the information it protects must justify
the cost.
Another facet of the DMZ is the creation of an area known as an extranet. An extranet is a
segment of the DMZ where additional authentication and authorization controls are put in
place to provide services that are not available to the general public. An example is an online
retailer that allows anyone to browse the product catalog and place items into a shopping
cart but requires extra authentication and authorization when the customer is ready to
check out and place an order.
Limitations of Firewalls
Firewalls can do a lot, but they can’t be expected to do it all. Firewalls should not be the only
form of protection for a network. They should be part of an overall security plan and should
be used in conjunction with other forms of protection, including intrusion prevention,

antivirus, and encrypted communication. Even the most elaborate firewall can’t protect
against an employee who brings a USB flash drive to work containing files that have been
infected with a virus, or employees who use a host inside the firewall to gain unauthorized
access to sensitive information.
There are a number of things that must be considered when deploying and maintaining a
firewall infrastructure:
●
Packet filtering has limitations—Filtering does not hide the IP addresses of the hosts
that are on the network inside the filter. The IP addresses are contained in the
outbound traffic, which makes it easy for attackers to target individual hosts behind
the filter to attack them. Filters also don’t check to make sure the protocols inside
packets are legitimate. Packet filtering can limit addresses based only on the source
IP address listed in the packet’s header, and thus it does not protect against
IP spoofing. For these reasons, firewalls that perform only packet filtering do
not provide adequate network protection.
●
Firewalls can be circumvented—Technically sophisticated attackers or technologies can
circumvent the firewall security measures you’ve set up. Here’s how that might happen:
●
An attacker might use a remote access service provider like GoToMyPC
(gotomypc.com). The service provider will have the user install an application
program, typically on both their home and work computers. Once the application
is installed, the service provider can allow the user to move network traffic
between the two endpoints. The traffic that the user is transferring may well go
through the firewall unchecked, and it presents an obvious security risk because
home networks are seldom as well defended as corporate networks.
●
An employee might bring to the office portable media (memory sticks, CD/DVDs,
etc.) that contain malware.
●
An attacker might obtain confidential information by contacting employees and
deceiving them into giving up passwords, IP addresses, server names, and so on
(i.e., social engineering).
●
An employee might open an e-mail attachment that launches a program capable of
spreading to other computers using the recipient’s e-mail address book. The
program might then damage files on the host machine or undertake any number of
harmful activities.
●
Firewalls are not fortresses—There are two key concepts to firewall deployment:
defense in depth and the principle of least privilege. In connection to firewalls, the
defense-in-depth concept mandates that a single firewall should not be your only
defense. Deploy a sound network firewall architecture, deploy host-based firewalls,
and use IPS and other security technologies to ensure that if a firewall is breached, the
attacker is stopped elsewhere. The principle of least privilege mandates that users be
given the minimum amount of privilege to do their jobs. With firewalls, this principle
translates into starting with default firewall rules that deny all traffic and then
gradually allowing more traffic as the business needs dictate.
●
Firewalls are not impenetrable—Like any IT hardware or software, firewalls must be
updated with the latest patches and fixes to keep up with the latest security threats.
Firewalls must also be supported by trained and experienced firewall administrators.

●
Firewall rules are not always simple—Firewall rules can become quite complex. They
should be audited and updated regularly to ensure that they don’t conflict and aren’t
not unnecessarily permissive.
●
Firewalls can’t protect network segments they’re not attached to—The placement of
firewalls in the overall IT environment is crucial. To ensure the level of protection you
want, know your network topology and ensure that the firewall is connected to the
intended networks.
●
Firewalls cannot create your security policy—The organization must develop a solid
security policy. Although there are a number of best practices in deploying firewalls,
there are business-specific needs that should be mandated in a security policy, then
translated into firewall rules.
●
Firewalls cannot read your security policy—In order to properly maintain a
firewall infrastructure, you must have trained administrators who understand
network protocols and the organization’s security policy. If the security policy
states that the IT environment must not allow FTP from outside the organization,
a trained network administrator would know to translate that requirement into
blocking not only the control session on port 21 but the FTP’s data session that
occurs on port 20.
●
Firewalls cannot speed up network traffic—A firewall will always introduce latency to
network traffic based on its need to examine packets before forwarding them to the
intended recipient. Make sure you properly scope the firewall equipment to minimize
the overall latency to the network and/or IT systems.
Chapter Summary
■
A firewall is hardware or software (or a combination of hardware and software) that
filters the transmission of packets of digital information as they attempt to pass
through a boundary of a network. Firewalls perform two basic security functions:
packet filtering and implementing proxy access for specific services.

A firewall can contain many components, including a packet filter, a proxy server, an
authentication system, and software that can perform port forwarding. Some firewalls
can encrypt traffic, and some help establish VPNs.
■
Packet filtering is a key function of any firewall. In fact, packet filters were one of
the first types of firewalls. Packet filters are an effective element in any perimeter
security setup. A packet-filtering firewall may be stateless or stateful. Stateless packet
filtering ignores the state of the connection between the internal computer and the
external computer. Stateful packet filtering is an examination of the data contained
in a packet, with a memory of the state of the connection between client and internal
and external computers.
■
Application-level gateways, also known as proxy servers, control the way applications
inside the network access external networks by setting up proxy services. This service
acts as a substitute (i.e., proxy) for the client, making requests for Web pages or
sending and receiving e-mail on behalf of individual users, who are thus shielded from
directly connecting with the Internet.

Firewalls can be categorized by generation or form factor. Technologically, firewalls
are categorized into generations, the later generations being more recently developed
and more complex. Categorizing firewalls by form factor refers to whether they are
residential-grade or commercial-grade, hardware-based or software-based, or
appliance-based devices.
■
Each of the firewall devices described in this chapter can be configured in a number of
network connection architectures. The configuration that works best for a particular
organization depends on three factors: the objectives of the network, the organization’s
ability to develop and implement the architectures, and the budget available for the
function. There are four common architectural implementations of firewalls: packet-filtering
routers, screened host firewalls, dual-homed firewalls, and screened subnet firewalls.

Real World Exercises
Exercise 4-1
You are assigned by upper management to purchase a firewall and hardware, but first you
have to prepare a report that (1) describes your organization’s network, (2) lists three
primary goals of a firewall, and (3) compares two different firewall packages that seem to
be good options. Prepare the report based on your classroom’s network.
Exercise 4-2
Create a diagram of your classroom’s network. Be sure to determine where the network
connects with the larger network—your school’s network or the Internet. Indicate on the
diagram where a firewall would go by drawing a miniature brick wall.
Hands-On Projects
Project 4-1
To get an idea of how vulnerable your computer is to attackers, go to one of
the Web sites that run security tests on machines. If your lab computer is
already equipped with a firewall, so much the better. Even if it is not
equipped, you can get an idea of the kinds of sensitive information you need to protect.
Follow these steps:
1. If your computer is not powered up, power it up now.
2. When the Log on to Windows dialog box appears, in the User Name text box, type
administrator.
3. In the Password text box, type password. (If this does not work, ask your instructor for
the password.)
4. Double-click the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop to start your browser.
5. In the Address box, type www.securityspace.com/smysecure/index.html.
6. Press Enter. The Security Space Security Audits page will appear in the browser window.
7. In order to run a free security scan on your workstation, you need to register with the
site’s owner, Security Space. Registration is free. Scroll down the page to the How to
Order/Run Audit section. Under New User, enter your e-mail address, and then enter a
username and password of your choosing. Deselect the two check boxes asking if you
want to receive e-mail notifications from this site, and then click Register. A Member
Services page appears, telling you your registration has been accepted and directing you
to check your e-mail.
8. Open the program you usually use to receive e-mail. Retrieve the e-mail message with
the subject line Member Services Registration Request, and click the link included in the
e-mail message. A Member Services Web page appears stating that your registration has
been confirmed.
9. In the Registered User section of the same Member Services page, enter the UserID and
password you just created, and then click Login.

Project 4-2
In this project, you install iptables for Red Hat Linux.
1.
Log in to the Linux console using your normal user account.
2.
At the command line, type su –. This command allows you to switch the user to the
root account. You will be prompted to enter the root account’s password.
3.
During the typical installation of Red Hat Linux, iptables is installed by default.
However, to check whether iptables is installed, run the following command from the
command line: rpm –q iptables. If RPM Package Manager (RPM) returns a version
number, then iptables is installed and you can skip the following step, because this
project is complete.
4.
If RPM returns the message indicating that the package named iptables is not installed,
you must install iptables manually. For that, you will have to install the package. To do
so, insert the Red Hat Linux installation CD (you may have to insert several of the
installation CDs to complete the setup process) and enter the following commands at
the command line:
mount –t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
cd /mnt/cdrom
rpm –ivh iptables-1.2.5-3.i386.rpm
(Note: the file name might be different based on the version number included with your
version of Red Hat Linux)
5.
Again check whether iptables is installed by running the following command from the
command line: rpm –q iptables. If RPM returns a version number, then iptables
was installed successfully.
Project 4-3
In this project, you configure iptables to deny all incoming traffic but allow all outgoing
traffic.
1.
After installing iptables, log in to Linux console using your normal user account.
2.
At the command line, type su – . This command allows you to switch the user to the
root account. You will be prompted to enter the root account’s password.
3.
Type iptables ––flush. What does this command do? Why is it important to run
this command?

4.
Next, set up the policy governing the incoming network traffic by typing iptables –P
INPUT DROP.
5.
Set up the policy governing the network traffic leaving your system by typing
iptables –P OUTPUT ACCEPT. What is the difference between the ACCEPT and
DROP options? Are there other options to use?
6.
Type iptables
–P
FORWARD
DROP. What network routing behavior does the
FORWARD policy control?
7.
After you have made the configuration changes, run the command ping google.com
(or use another remote host or IP address) from your Linux workstation. Do you
receive a response? Why or why not?
8.
Try pinging the network address of your Linux workstation from another system. Do
you receive a response? Why or why not? (Note: to list the IP address of your Linux
workstation, type ifconfig.)
When running iptables, you may encounter an error similar to the
following: “/lib/modules/2.4.17-0.1/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.o:
init_module: Device or resource busy.” This may occur if both firewall
packages, the ipchains and the iptables, are started at the same time.
To fix the problem, run the following command: chkconfig—del
ipchains. Then, reboot your Linux workstation.
Project 4-4
In this hands-on project, you configure iptables to simulate a firewall that only allows
incoming network traffic to the organization’s Web servers.
1.
After installing iptables, log in to the Linux console using your normal user account.
2.
At the command line, type su – . This command allows you to switch user to the root
account. You will be prompted to enter the root account’s password.
3.
Type iptables
–A
INPUT
–p
tcp
--destination-port
80
–j
ACCEPT.
What does the –j command line option do?
4.
Type iptables –A INPUT –p tcp --destination-port 443 –j ACCEPT.
Why is it necessary to allow traffic over both ports 80 and 443? What option would
you use to open UDP ports 80 and 443?
5.
To view the rules in effect for iptables, type iptables –-list or iptables –L.
What is the current output?
Project 4-5
In this project, you configure iptables to block a certain IP address. This exercise demon-
strates a situation in which a visitor is abusing his or her access to your Web site. In order
to prevent access, the abuser’s IP address is blocked at the iptables firewall.
1.
After installing iptables, log in to the Linux console using your normal user account.
2.
At the command line, type su – . This command allows you to switch the user to the
root account. You will be prompted to enter the root account’s password.

Network Authentication
and Remote Access Using VPN
The whole notion of passwords is based on an oxymoron. The idea is to have a random
string that is easy to remember. Unfortunately, if it’s easy to remember, it’s something
nonrandom like “Susan.” And if it’s random, like “r7U2*Qnp,” then it’s not easy to
remember. — Bruce Schneier
Upon completion of this material, you should be able to:
●Define access control and identify the various ways it can be implemented
●Explain why authentication is a critical aspect of network access control
●Identify the component parts of virtual private networks (VPNs)
●List and define the essential activities that an VPN must be able to perform
●Explain the various VPN architectures in common use

Introduction
Unlike some strategies used to secure information systems, network security strategies authen-
ticate machines rather than individuals. For example, a firewall filters traffic based on a
machine’s IP address, not on the end user sending or receiving that traffic. Some network
security devices—for example, Network Access Control (NAC) and virtual private net-
work (VPN) access controllers—can perform a stronger level of authentication. That is,
they typically deploy stronger authentication mechanisms to determine whether persons
or entities are who they claim to be. This level of authentication is important because if
an unauthorized user gains access to protected resources, the whole purpose of the firewall
has been defeated. For this reason, many network devices implement user authentication
schemes to support their other security approaches.
In this chapter, you will learn what authentication is and why it is important to network secu-
rity in general. Because passwords are a critical part of all the aforementioned authentication
The PCI audit preparation was continuing at EBS. As part of the PCI prep, Paige Davis
worried about usernames and passwords. A large number of the Sales staff and other
traveling workers needed to access EBS remotely via the company’s virtual private
network (VPN). Strictly enforced password policies for accessing the network
remotely had resulted in users writing down their passwords on sticky notes that
they attached to their computer monitors or on pieces of paper they tacked to the
bulletin board. On the other hand, lax password policies would give abusers an open
door to the company’s user accounts. It seemed there was no easy answer … until
Paige discovered two-factor authentication.
With two-factor authentication, employees could authenticate themselves to EBS’s
VPN using a password and a code displayed randomly by a key token. Employees
would still have user IDs; however, they would also need (1) something they knew
(i.e., their passwords) and (2) something they had (i.e., the key tokens)—the two
factors. Given that it would cost around $25 per workstation, the plan seemed
reasonable.
It was reasonable to Paige, anyway. To authenticate the 500 users at EBS using key
tokens, the cost would be a mere $12,500. When Paige eagerly presented the plan to
the EBS CIO for approval, however, the CIO just as eagerly denied the request and
declared that usernames and passwords were sufficient security controls. “Why do
business concerns always win?” Paige asked herself, glumly. The battle for secure
authentication remained to be won.

schemes, you’ll explore password security issues and learn about special password security
tools, including one-time passwords. Then you’ll learn how and why network security devices
perform authentication services. This chapter also introduces the main types of authentication
performed by network security devices—client, user, and session authentication—as well as
the different types of centralized authentication methods that network security devices can
use, including Kerberos, TACACS+, and RADIUS.
VPNs function like private leased lines: They encapsulate and encrypt the data being transmit-
ted, and they use authentication to ensure that only approved users can access the VPN. How-
ever, rather than using an expensive leased line, VPNs provide a means of secure point-to-point
communications over the public Internet. In this chapter, you will also learn the role VPNs play
in providing remote access to end users.
Access Control
Access control enables organizations to restrict access to information, information assets,
and other tangible assets to those who have a bona fide business need. Access controls reg-
ulate the admission of users into trusted areas of the organization—both logical access to
the information systems and physical access to the organization’s facilities. Access control
is maintained by means of a collection of policies, programs to carry out those policies, and
technologies that enforce those policies. Access control comprises four processes: obtaining
the identity of the entity that requests access to a logical or physical area (identification),
confirming the identity of the entity that seeks access to a logical or physical area (authentication),
determining which actions an authenticated entity can perform in that physical or logical
area (authorization), and documenting the activities of the authenticated individual and sys-
tems (accountability).
We will cover accountability in more detail in Chapter 10, “Auditing
and Logging.”
Access control is built on several key principles, including:
●
Least privilege—This is the principle by which members of the organization are
allowed to access the minimal amount of information for the minimal amount of time
necessary to perform their required duties. Under this principle, users are given access
appropriate to the level required for their assigned duties. For example, if a task
requires only the reading of data, the user is given read-only access, which does not
allow the creation, updating, or deletion of data.
●
Need to know—This principle limits a user’s access to the specific information
required to perform the currently assigned task, not some category of data required
for a general work function. For example, a manager who needs to change a specific
employee’s pay rate is granted access to read and update that data but is restricted
from accessing pay data for other employees. This principle is most frequently
associated with data classification.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

●
Separation of duties—This principle requires that tasks be split up in such a way that
more than one individual is responsible for their completion. For example, in accounts
payable situations, one person may set up a vendor, another may request payments
for the vendor, and a third may authorize the payments. Separation of duties reduces
the chance of an individual violating information security policy and breaching the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information.
Categories of Access Control
There are a number of ways to categorize access controls. One way is by their functional
characteristics, each control falling into one of the following categories:
●
Deterrent—Discourages or deters an incipient incident
●
Preventative—Helps an organization avoid an incident
●
Detective—Detects or identifies an incident or threat when it occurs
●
Corrective—Remedies a circumstance or mitigates the damage done during an incident
●
Recovery—Restores operating conditions to normal
●
Compensating—Resolves shortcomings1
A second approach, described in the NIST Special Publication SP800-12 (http://csrc.nist.gov/
publications/PubsSPs.html), categorizes security controls into three general classes:
●
Management—“Techniques and concerns that are normally addressed by management
in the organization’s computer security program. In general, they focus on the
management of the computer security program and the management of risk within
the organization.”
●
Operational (or administrative)—“Controls that are … implemented and executed
by people (as opposed to systems). These controls are put in place to improve the
security of a particular system (or group of systems). They often require technical or
specialized expertise and often rely upon management activities as well as technical
controls.”
●
Technical—“Controls that the computer system executes. These controls are
dependent upon the proper functioning of the system for their effectiveness.
The implementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant
operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of
security within the organization.”2
Table 5-1 shows examples of controls categorized by both the approaches just described.
A third approach categorizes controls by the degree of flexibility under which they are
applied. Controls can be mandatory, discretionary, or nondiscretionary; each category reg-
ulates access to a particular type or collection of information.
Mandatory Access Controls A mandatory access control (MAC) is one in which the
computer system enforces the controls without the input or intervention of the system or data
owner. In order to implement MAC, a strict user and data classification scheme is
required. For example, if data is classified as “Super Sensitive,” then the user must also
have been through the proper administrative procedures to be allowed access to data

rated as “Super Sensitive.” These ratings are often referred to as sensitivity levels. When
MACs are implemented, users and data owners have little to no control over setting access
to information resources.
U.S. Military Classification Scheme The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is perhaps
the best-known user of data classification schemes that assign MAC sensitivity levels. In fact,
many developments in data communications and information security are the result of
military-sponsored research and development. As you might expect, military classification
schemes rely on a more complex set of sensitivity levels than those at most corporations.
For most of its information, the military uses a five-level classification scheme that is defined
in Executive Order 12958:
●
Unclassified data—Generally free for distribution to the public; poses no threat
to U.S. national interests.
●Sensitive but unclassified (SBU) data—Any information of which the loss, mis-
use, or unauthorized access to, or modification of, might adversely affect U.S.
national interests, the conduct of Department of Defense (DoD) programs, or
the privacy of DoD personnel. Common designations include For Official Use
Only, Not for Public Release, or For Internal Use Only.
●Confidential data—Any information or material the unauthorized disclosure of
which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.
Examples of damage include the compromise of information that indicates
strength of ground, air, and naval forces in the United States and overseas areas;
disclosure of technical information used for training, maintenance, and inspection
of classified munitions of war; and revelation of performance characteristics, test
data, design, and production data on munitions of war.
●Secret data—Any information or material the unauthorized disclosure of which
reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.
Examples of serious damage include disruption of foreign relations significantly
affecting the national security; significant impairment of a program or policy
directly related to the national security; revelation of significant military plans or

intelligence operations; compromise of significant military plans or intelligence
operations; and compromise of significant scientific or technological develop-
ments relating to national security.
●Top secret data—Any information or material the unauthorized disclosure of
which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the
national security. Examples of exceptionally grave damage include armed hostili-
ties against the United States or its allies; disruption of foreign relations vitally
affecting the national security; the compromise of vital national defense plans or
complex cryptologic and communications intelligence systems; the revelation of
sensitive intelligence operations; and the disclosure of scientific or technological
developments vital to national security. This classification comes with the general
expectation of “cradle to grave” protection, meaning that individuals entrusted
with top secret information are expected to honor the classification of the infor-
mation for life, even after they are no longer employed in the role that originally
allowed them to access the information.3
These data classifications are then applied to data to ensure the optimal level of protec-
tion. In concert, the personnel security clearance structure ensures that each user of an
information asset is assigned an authorization level that identifies the level of information
classification he or she can access. Individuals who then need to access the data must also
hold the same security clearance level to access the data. For example, an employee must
hold a personal security clearance level of Top Secret in order to access Top Secret infor-
mation. Thus, the scheme enforces a MAC model that does not allow flexibility of data
access based on individuals or data.
The military further divides information into compartments to ensure
that only individuals with the “Need to Know” can access informa-
tion, regardless of the information’s data classification level. There
are also specialty classification ratings, such as Personnel Information
and Evaluation Reports, to protect related areas of information. Fed-
eral agencies such as the FBI and CIA also use specialty classification
schemes, such as Need-to-Know and Named Projects. Obviously,
Need-to-Know authorization allows access to information by indivi-
duals who need the information to perform their work. Named
Projects are clearance levels based on a scheme similar to Need-
to-Know. When an operation, project, or set of classified data is
created, the project is assigned a code name. Next, a list of authorized
individuals is created and assigned to either the Need-to-Know or the
Named Projects category.
Discretionary Access Controls Discretionary access controls (DACs) are implemen-
ted at the discretion of the data owner. Sharing resources in a peer-to-peer configuration
allows users to control access to information or resources at their disposal. This can mean
allowing general, unrestricted access, or it can mean allowing specific individuals or sets of
individuals to access these resources. For example, suppose that a user has a hard drive con-
taining information to be shared with office coworkers. This user can allow specific indivi-
duals to access this drive by listing their names in the share control function. Most personal
computer operating systems use the DAC model.

An example of a DAC model is an access control matrix, which arranges users in rows
and objects in columns. At the intersections of each row and column, an individual user’s
rights are specified. As shown in Figure 5-1, each business unit’s shared file directory is a
column (these are called objects) and the users are listed as rows (these are called subjects).
The intersection of each row and column identifies the access rights for that subject for
that object. This type of table can be easily checked to determine which user has access to
which object.
Another example of a DAC model is rule-based access controls, in which access to informa-
tion is granted based on a set of rules specified by a central authority. This is a DAC model
because the individual user is the one who decides which rules apply. Role-based models,
described in the following section, can also be implemented under DAC if an individual sys-
tem owner wants to create the rules for other users of that system or its data.
Nondiscretionary Controls Nondiscretionary controls are determined by a central
authority and can be either role-based access controls (RBAC) or task-based controls.
Task-based controls can, in turn, be based on lists maintained on either subjects or objects.
Role-based controls are tied to the role that a particular user performs in an organization,
whereas task-based controls are tied to a particular assignment or responsibility.
Using role- and task-based controls makes it easier to maintain access permissions and
restrictions, especially if the person performing the role or task changes often. Instead of
constantly assigning and revoking the privileges of people who come and go, the adminis-
trator simply assigns the associated access rights to the role or task. The person assigned to
that role or task automatically receives the corresponding access. The administrator can easily
remove people’s associations with roles and tasks, thereby revoking their access.

Other Forms of Access Control Access control is developing rapidly, both in the
principles it’s based on and the technology that is used. Other forms of access control include:
●
Content-dependent—Making access to specific information dependent on its content.
For example, the marketing department might be given access to marketing data,
the accounting department is given access to accounting data, and so forth.
●
Constrained user interfaces—Restricting what information an individual user can
access. The most common example is a bank’s automated teller machine (ATM),
which restricts authorized users to simple account queries, transfers, deposits, and
withdrawals.
●
Temporal (time-based) isolation—Putting a time-of-day constraint on information
access. An example is a time-release safe, found in most convenience and fast-food
establishments. The safe can only be opened during a specific time frame, even if by
an authorized user (e.g., the store manager).
Should access controls be centralized or decentralized? A collection
of users who have access to the same data typically has a centralized
access control authority, even under a discretionary access control
model. The level of centralization varies by organization and by the
type of information being protected. The less critical the protected
information, the more decentralized the controls tend to be. When
critical information assets are being protected, the use of a highly
centralized access control toolset is indicated.
Identification
Identification is the process by which a computer system recognizes a user’s identity.4 Most
often, identification is performed by means of a user account. In network security, accounts
are stored in one of two places:
●
Local accounts—A server maintains a local file of usernames and passwords to which
it refers for matching the username-password pair being supplied by a client. This is
the most common form of authentication, the weakness of which is that passwords
can be forgotten, stolen, or accidentally revealed, thus compromising the user’s
account.
●
Centralized accounts—A centralized server handles user accounts for a number
of different systems on the network. For example, Microsoft’s Active Directory
(AD) provides a centralized mechanism whereby users can authenticate themselves
once to their user account but gain access to multiple network and server
resources.
Default Accounts All operating systems come with a preinstalled user account (or
accounts). This account—for example, “root” in the UNIX operating system or “administrator”
in Windows operating systems—generally has administrative access to the system and is
used to create additional accounts. Attackers know which default accounts are included
with an operating system, so these accounts need to be renamed. By doing so, you force
attackers to spend more time discerning or guessing a username.

In addition, a large number of applications use a default user account when the application
needs to log into the operating system. Default application usernames can also be determined
quite easily from the manufacturer’s documentation. Like default operating system accounts,
application user accounts should be renamed to make intrusion more difficult for abusers.
Because of the high level of access and control that these accounts have over the operating sys-
tem, system administrators should take every precaution to protect these accounts, including
the use of strong passwords, as discussed later in this chapter.
Periodic Reviews Network administrators should periodically review user accounts.
There are two types of checks. One check determines if the employee still works at the com-
pany. (If the employee is not found in the company’s human resources system, the account
can be removed or disabled for a period of time and later removed.) The other check deter-
mines if the employee still requires an account on a particular system or application. This
requires more user intervention because the owning user or manager must validate that the
business need still exists.
Authentication
Authentication is the act of confirming the identity or user account. Once the identity is
confirmed as authentic, that user is authorized to perform specific actions on the system
or network. Potential users (sometimes called supplicants) first propose an identity (a pro-
cess known as identification) and then verify (or authenticate) that identity by providing
some combination of the following:
●
Something you know—A piece of information known to the supplicant, such as a
password or passphrase
●
Something you have—Proof of physical possession of something, such as a smart card
(a plastic card with an embedded microchip that can store data about the owner) or
a metal key
●
Something you are—A piece of information that indicates something about the
supplicant’s physical nature. This piece of information can refer to a physical attribute
(a fingerprint or an iris scan) or it can rely on pattern recognition (a voiceprint or a
keyboard typing pattern).
Most commonly, authentication is completed by requiring a user to enter a password at
some point, which, if that is all that is required, is an example of single-factor authentica-
tion. The user needs to know only one item (the password) to initiate the authentication
process.
Physical objects such as smart cards or other kinds of physical tokens offer the more strin-
gent level of two-factor authentication in which users need to have something (the token)
and know something (the PIN or password) to gain access. For example, you withdraw
cash from a debit account with a bank card. Along with the card (something you have),
you also need to enter a PIN (something you know) to authenticate yourself to the
bank’s network. After you are authenticated, the ATM gives you access to your account.
An authentication system that, like the bank ATM example, uses two different forms of
confirmation for the proposed identity is known as strong authentication or two-factor
authentication.

Biometrics (retinal scans, fingerprints, and the like) are mainly used for authentication by
large security-minded entities such as banking institutions and credit card centers for regulating
access to sensitive information, but biometrics are also gaining ground in the general corporate
world.
Password Security Issues
Many authentication systems depend in part or entirely on passwords. In fact, the simplest
forms of authentication require typing a username and a reusable password. The following
sections discuss password security issues that you need to be aware of to prevent your net-
work from being accessed by unauthorized users.
Cracking The traditional access control mechanism consists of both a username and a
password. However, because system administrators tend to follow some sort of standard
convention (e.g., first initial and last name—jdoe), usernames are usually easy to guess.
Defending access control, therefore, rests with protecting the password.
The generally accepted definition of cracking refers to guessing, breaking, and/or stealing
passwords to gain access to a system or application. Usually, once a password is obtained,
the attacker logs in by impersonating an authorized user. Most operating systems and applica-
tions use a password scheme that takes a user account’s password, passes it through a hash
algorithm, and stores it somewhere on the system. The purpose of the hash is to transform
the password into an unreadable format that makes it impossible to reverse the transfor-
mation back into the original password text.
To obtain passwords, crackers try dictionary and brute force attacks. A dictionary attack
throws every known word (sometimes in many languages) into the authentication system
until something matches what’s stored on the system. For example, using “fox” as a pass-
word presents a problem because it is only three characters long and is a common animal
name. A dictionary attack against this password would succeed in a very short time.
A brute-force attack tries every possible character, number, and symbol combination to guess
the password. These processes are time-intensive, so they are rarely aimed at the target system
in general. Instead, crackers steal the password files from the target systems, crack the pass-
words on their local systems, and then use the stolen passwords to log into the target system.
Crackers can also use published rainbow tables to help with password lookups. Rainbow
tables contain hash outputs for a myriad of different password combinations using different
hash algorithms. These tables can save time because the cracker can look up a suspected
password, get the hash output from the rainbow table, and then see if that hash output
occurs within the password file.
Security professionals who lecture on the need for password complexity are trying to prevent
cracking attacks. The more characters and combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols
that a password contains, the more difficult it is to carry out a cracking attack. Password
complexity should be required by a company’s security policy and included within the pass-
word policies of computer and network systems.
Password Policies To protect against cracking, each password must be hard to guess,
must be changed often, and must be used by only one person. Luckily, most network devices
and systems accommodate policies that restrict the configuration of passwords by creating a

password policy. The following password policy guidelines help enforce password confi-
dentiality by making attacks too time-consuming to attempt. Passwords should:
●
Be at least eight characters long
●
Contain at least one uppercase character
●
Contain at least one lowercase character
●
Contain at least one number
●
Contain at least one symbol (#,$, %, ^, &, etc.)
●
Contain no part of the user’s name
●
Contain no words commonly found in a dictionary
●
Contain no repeating characters
●
Be combined with a salt when calculating hashes. A salt is a secret value that is
combined with the plaintext password to create the final stored password hash.
That way, even if the password file is stolen, rainbow tables can’t be used to
reverse-engineer the value.
A password policy should also have a number of restrictions. The login policy should require
that the password system do the following:
●
Force users to change passwords at a minimum of every 90 days.
●
Remember, at minimum, 10 previous passwords used on that system so that the user
cannot reuse old passwords when it’s time to change them.
●
Lock accounts after, say, three to five invalid login attempts.
●
Disable accounts when the lockout threshold has been met, after which users must be
required to contact a help desk or administrator to reset the account.
Lax Security Lax security practices can also contribute to compromised passwords. Things
to avoid include:
●
Using simple passwords or words that are easy to remember
●
Storing passwords on pieces of paper displayed in readily visible areas
●
Using the same password to access different systems
●
Sharing passwords with others
The chance that passwords will be guessed can be reduced by telling users to choose pass-
words that are not words contained in the dictionary (e.g., “purple”), simple keyboard
tricks (e.g., “qwerty”), or memorable dates (e.g., your birthday.) A simple trick is to use a
combination of words and a number that’s complicated enough not to be guessed easily
(e.g., “purple1qwerty”).
Another option is to have users use passphrases, which are similar to passwords but longer.
Like passwords, passphrases should not simply consist of a combination of dictionary words,
and they should contain uppercase and lowercase characters, numeric values, and special
characters. For example, you could make the basis of your passphrase “Go Bama, Roll
Tide!” but remove the spaces and replace some of the characters with numeric values and spe-
cial characters, leaving you with the passphrase “G0Bama,R0ll+1d3!”

Users should also be told to memorize the passwords rather than write them down and to
never reveal their passwords to anyone, even though recent developments in PDA and
smartphone applications allow users to securely store system information in an encrypted
format without additional concern for disclosure.
One-Time Password Software The risks introduced by poor password management
can be offset by passwords that are generated for one-time use during a single session and
then discarded. Three types are available:
●
Challenge-response passwords—Each time the user logs in, the authenticating
computer or firewall generates a new random number (the challenge) and sends it
to the user, who enters a secret PIN or password (the response). If the challenge and
PIN or password match the information stored on the authenticating server, the
user gains access.
●
Password list passwords—The user enters a seed phrase, and the password system
generates a list of passwords the user can use. The user picks one from the list and
submits it along with the seed phrase to gain access.
●
Token generators—An even higher level of security is realized by firewalls that work
with hardware devices called token generators, which automatically generate and
display the next password the user types.
Implementing Authentication
Most operating systems are equipped with authentication schemes. Web servers can be con-
figured to authenticate clients who want to access certain protected content. Firewalls and
VPN access controllers can also perform user authentication. In fact, many organizations
depend on these devices to provide more secure authentication than conventional systems.
Authentication is a key function because firewalls exist to give external users (such as mobile
users and telecommuters) access to protected resources.
Authentication comes into play when a network security device such as a firewall is called
upon to apply its set of rules to specific individuals or groups of users. For instance, the
IT staff may need remote access to all the computers in the organization; thus, a higher level
of security is needed to ensure that only the proper individuals are granted such a level of
access. On the other hand, the head of a company’s accounting department may need remote
access to the company once a quarter or once a year—not frequently enough to warrant the
establishment of a dedicated network connection.
A firewall uses authentication to identify individuals so that it can apply rules that have been
associated with those individuals. Some firewalls use authentication to give employees access
to common resources, such as the Web or file transfer protocol (FTP). Some identify the user
associated with a particular IP address; after the user is authorized, the IP address can then
be used to send and receive information between hosts on the internal network.
The exact steps that firewalls follow to authenticate users may vary, but the general process
is as follows:
1.
The client makes a request to access a resource.
2.
The firewall intercepts the request and prompts the user for name and password.

3.
The user submits the requested information to the firewall.

The user is authenticated.

The request is checked against the firewall’s rule base.
6.
If the request matches an existing allow rule, the user is granted access.
7.
The user accesses the desired resources.
The “plain English” version of the exchange between external client and authenticating
firewall is illustrated in Figure 5-2.
User Authentication Some firewalls provide for a variety of authentication methods.
User authentication is the simplest type and the one with which you are most likely to be
familiar. Upon receiving a request, a program prompts the user for a username and password.
When the information is submitted, the software checks the information against a list of user-
names and passwords in its database. If a match is made, the user is authenticated.
User authentication can enable the following users to access your internal servers:
●
Remote or work-at-home employees
●
Traveling employees
●
Contractors
●
Guests or visitors with a genuine “need to know”
●
Special employees: interns, temporary, or conditional employees
●
Employees of partner companies
●
Members of the public who need to get into your internal network to make
purchases, change contact information, or review account information
Authorized users should be added to your access control lists (ACLs). An ACL is a list of
authorization rights attached to an object—in other words, who can access that device or
application and what can they do with it. These can be organized by directory or even by

individual files, but most often they are organized by groups of users because this sim-
plifies administration. How you organize the ACL depends on how many users you
have, how many resources you need to protect, and how much time you have to administer
the ACL.
Client Authentication Of course, not every outside user should gain access to everything
on the network. Client authentication can help you establish limits to user access. Client
authentication is similar to user authentication but with the addition of usage limits. The
firewall enables the authenticated user to access the desired resources for a specific period
of time (e.g., one hour) or for a specific number of times.
To configure client authentication, the administrator needs to set up one of two types of
authentication systems:
●
Standard sign-on—The client, after being authenticated, is allowed to access whatever
resources the user needs to perform any desired functions, such as transferring files or
viewing Web pages.
●
Specific sign-on—The client must authenticate each time it accesses a server or uses a
service on the protected network.
Network Access Control (NAC) As the threats posed by internal users on local networks
grow, IT organizations have turned to Network Access Control (NAC) technologies to help
solve the problem of verifying the security of various endpoints that connect to the local
network. This client authentication technology intercepts attempts to access the network and
scans the system to determine the security of the system. If the system meets the internal
security policy, the system is then allowed to connect to the network.
Although there are a number of different NAC technologies on the market, the basic idea
behind NAC is that before a device is allowed to communicate on a network, it must first
prove that it:
●
Has authorized user credentials needed to access the network
●
Has the appropriate security tools installed
●
Has the appropriate system configuration
●
Has OS patches installed and software versions that are up to date
●
Complies with established security standards (e.g., no P2P software installed)
Once the endpoint is verified as meeting the NAC thresholds, the system can communicate
on the wireless or local network with the typical network access. If, however, the endpoint
does not pass these initial tests, the system is denied access or quarantined on a special sub-
net, where it can access the appropriate security remediation software and instructions.
Session Authentication Session authentication requires authentication whenever a
client system attempts to connect to a network resource and establish a session (a period
when communications are exchanged). Session authentication can be used with any service.
The client system wishing to be authenticated is usually equipped with a software agent that
enables the authentication process; the server or firewall detects the agent when the connection
request is made. When necessary, the firewall intercepts the connection request and contacts

the agent. The agent performs the authentication, and the firewall allows the connection to the
required resource.
Some advanced firewalls offer multiple authentication methods. Which one should you choose?
It depends on the client operating system and the applications you need to authenticate.
Choose user authentication if the protocols that you want authorized users to use include
FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, rlogin, or Telnet. Choose client authentication or session authentication
when only a single user will be coming from a single IP address. Table 5-2 gives the reasons
for using each authentication method.
Centralized Authentication Large corporations often develop complex sets of secu-
rity requirements that are difficult to maintain and require different types of authentication
control for different purposes. Fortunately, deploying a centralized authentication server
can greatly simplify such enterprise-wide authentication. This centralized server maintains
all the authorizations for users regardless of where a user is located and how the user con-
nects to the network.
In a centralized authentication setup, a server—sometimes referred to as an authentication,
authorization, and auditing (or accountability) (AAA) server—alleviates the need to provide
each server on the network with a separate database of usernames and passwords, each of
which has to be updated every time a password changes or a user is added. The process of
centralized authentication is illustrated in Figure 5-3. It begins with a client on a local net-
work requesting access to a program held on an application server. First, though, the cli-
ent must be authenticated using the authentication server. Two levels of trust are involved:
The client trusts that the authentication server holds the correct information, and the
application server trusts that the authentication server can correctly identify and authorize
the client. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5-3 has a substantial downside: The authenti-
cation server becomes a single point of failure. Organizations that use this method should
have contingency plans for getting the server back online or should have alternative servers to
limit downtime.
Centralized authentication can use a number of different authentication methods. The fol-
lowing sections examine some of the most common ones, including Kerberos, TACACS+,
and RADIUS.

Kerberos Developed at MIT, Kerberos is designed to provide authentication and encryp-
tion on standard clients and servers. Instead of a server having to trust a client over an
untrusted network, both client and server place their trust in the Kerberos server. Kerberos
provides an effective network authentication system that is used internally on Windows 7
and Windows XP systems. It also has backward compatibility with Microsoft’s NTLM pro-
tocol, which is used in Windows NT 4.0 and earlier. Although Kerberos is useful for authen-
tication to a local system, care must be taken when authenticating via a Kerberos system on
the network. As in all situations regarding the passing of credentials on the network, proper
steps must be taken to ensure they are not passed in plaintext. Remote users should make use
of encrypted transmissions or one-time passwords, which are discussed later in this chapter.
The Kerberos system of granting access to a client that requests a service is quite involved
(and thus quite secure). The steps are as follows:
1.
The client requests a file or other service.
2.
The client is prompted for a username and password.
3.
The client submits a username and password. The request goes to a Kerberos Authen-
tication Server (AS) that is part of the Kerberos system. The AS creates an encrypted
code called a session key that is based on the client’s password plus a random number
associated with the service being requested. The session key functions as a ticket-
granting ticket (TGT).
4.
AS grants the TGT.
5.
The client presents the TGT to a ticket-granting server (TGS), which is also part of the
Kerberos system and that may or may not be the same server as the AS.
6.
The TGS grants a session ticket. The TGS forwards the session ticket to the server holding
the requested file or service.
7.
The client gains access.
The Kerberos authentication server is also known as a key distribution center (KDC). In
Windows networks, a domain controller also functions as an authentication server. The
Kerberos server must be highly secured because of the strong level of trust placed in it.

One great advantage of using the Kerberos ticket system is that passwords are not stored
on the system and, thus, cannot be intercepted by hackers. The tickets issued are specific
to the individual user who made the request and to the services the user is attempting to
access. Tickets have a time limit (typically, eight hours, although this can be configured
by the security administrator). Before a ticket expires, the client may make additional
requests using the same ticket without reauthenticating itself. Another advantage is that
Kerberos is widely used in the UNIX environment, which enables authentication to take
place across operating systems—for example, a Windows client can be authenticated by a
UNIX server, or vice versa. The authentication process is illustrated in Figure 5-4. You can
download trial versions of both the Kerberos client and server from the MIT Kerberos Dis-
tribution page at http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/dist/index.html.
TACACS+ Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)—commonly
called “tac-plus”—is the latest and strongest version of a set of authentication protocols
developed by Cisco Systems. TACACS+ replaces its less secure predecessor protocols,
TACACS and XTACACS. TACACS+ and its predecessor protocols all provide authentica-
tion for dial-in users and are used primarily on UNIX-based networks. TACACS+ uses the
MD5 algorithm (a hash algorithm developed in 1991 by Ron Rivest of RSA that produces
a 128-bit code called a message digest) to encrypt data.
It provides centralized authentication services so that a network access server such as a router or
firewall doesn’t have to handle dial-in user authentication. An organization might have to use
TACACS+ or RADIUS (described in the following section) if its firewall doesn’t support
authentication or if its authentication needs are so extensive that they might slow down other
tasks the firewall is called on to perform. For more information about the MD5 algorithm and
other security tools, visit the Internet RFC repository site at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt.

authentication. Note that RADIUS still transmits unencrypted authentication packets across the
network, which means they are vulnerable to attacks from packet sniffers. RADIUS is generally
considered to provide a lower level of security than TACACS+, even though it’s more widely
supported.
TACACS+ and RADIUS Compared If you authenticate users who connect to your net-
work from remote locations, chances are you’ll use either TACACS+ or RADIUS. Table 5-3
compares the two protocols.
As you can tell from Table 5-3, TACACS+ provides stronger security than RADIUS. TCP,
which TACACS+ uses, is considered more secure than UDP, an alternative network com-
munications protocol, because when a host sends a TCP packet, it expects a packet to be
sent in response, with the ACK bit to show that a connection has been established. ACK
(for acknowledgement), which is one of the flags in the TCP header part of a packet, indi-
cates that the destination computer has received the packets that were previously sent.
UDP, in contrast, is considered “connectionless.” If a UDP packet is sent, an acknowledge-
ment packet is not sent. If the destination host doesn’t receive the packet, it simply asks for
the packet to be re-sent.
TCP traffic can be filtered by firewalls based on the presence of the ACK bit. TACACS+
also does full-packet encryption, and it handles accounting (i.e., auditing or logging) as
well as authentication and authorization; RADIUS stores passwords in cleartext. Note,
however, that if you use both a firewall and an authentication server, the encryption bene-
fits of TACACS+ aren’t as dramatic because the firewall receives communications directly
from the Internet, and because the firewall and authentication server communicate with
one another over a trusted network. RADIUS can be a viable solution in this type of
network configuration.
Filtering Characteristics TACACS+ uses TCP Port 49, so in order to use it you need to set
up rules that enable clients to exchange authorization packets with the TACACS+ or RADIUS
server. RADIUS uses UDP Port 1812 for authentication and UDP Port 1813 for accounting.
Table 5-4 shows a set of packet-filtering rules that enables users on an internal network pro-
tected by a firewall to be authenticated by a TACACS+ or RADIUS server.

Proxy Characteristics Note that RADIUS doesn’t work with generic proxy systems. How-
ever, a RADIUS server can function as a proxy server, speaking to other RADIUS servers or
other services that do authorization, such as Windows domain authentication.
TACACS+ does work with generic proxy systems. Because some TACACS+ systems use the
same IP address to generate the key, you may need a dedicated proxy that has its own
encryption key.
NAT Characteristics RADIUS doesn’t work with NAT. As mentioned in Chapter 2, NAT
translates public IP addresses to private IP addresses. Addresses that are intended to go
through NAT need to be static, not dynamic. TACACS+ should work with NAT systems,
but because TACACS+ supports encryption using a secret key shared between server and cli-
ent, there is no way for the server to know which key to use if different clients make use of
different keys. Static IP address mappings work best because some TACACS+ systems use the
source IP address to create the encryption key.
Virtual Private Networks
The networks that organizations create are seldom used only by people at that location. When
connections are made between one network and another, the connections are arranged and
managed carefully. Installing such network connections requires using leased lines or other
data channels provided by common carriers, and therefore these connections are usually per-
manent and secured under the requirements of a formal service agreement. However, when
individuals—whether employees working from home, employees who are traveling, or con-
tract workers hired for specific assignments—seek to connect to an organization’s network(s),
a more flexible option must be provided.

In the past, organizations provided these remote connections exclusively through dial-up ser-
vices like Remote Authentication Service (RAS). Although connections via dial-up and leased
lines are becoming less popular, they are still quite common. It is widely believed, however,
that these unsecured, dial-up connection points represent a substantial exposure to attack. An
attacker who suspects that an organization has dial-up lines can use a device called a war
dialer to locate the connection points. A war dialer is an automatic phone-dialing program
that dials every phone number in a configured range (e.g., from 555–1000 to 555–2000) and
checks to see if a person, answering machine, or modem answers. If a modem answers, the
war dialer program makes a note of the number and then moves to the next target number.
The attacker then attempts to hack into the network via the identified modem connection
using a variety of techniques. Dial-up network connectivity is usually less sophisticated than
that deployed with Internet connections. For the most part, simple username and password
schemes are the only means of authentication. However, some technologies, such as RADIUS
and TACACS+ password systems (discussed earlier in this chapter), have improved the
authentication process, and there are even systems now that use strong encryption.
Because the Internet continues to permeate the developed world, other options such as virtual
private networks (VPNs) have become more popular than dial-up and other dedicated remote
connection technologies. Organizations rely on firewalls to protect networked informa-
tion assets, and they have come to rely on VPN technologies to enable users to make secure
connections, using the public Internet, between where they are working and the company
networks they depend on for communication and access to critical information.
Organizations routinely join two or more LANs to facilitate point-to-point communications
over a secure line. Private leased lines are often used to connect remote users or branch offices
to a central administrative site. However, private leased lines, such as the frame relay high-
speed network connections mentioned in Chapter 2, don’t scale well; the cost of leased lines
and the complexity of the technology used to support them often make this an expensive, if
more reliable, option than using the public Internet infrastructure. The growth and widespread
use of the Internet has been coupled with the use of encryption technology to produce a solu-
tion for specific types of private communication channels: virtual private networks (VPNs).
VPNs function like private leased lines; they encapsulate and encrypt the data being transmitted,
and they use authentication to ensure that only approved users can access the VPN. However,
unlike a leased line, VPNs provide a means of secure point-to-point communications over
the public Internet.
Extranets and Intranets
Whether you use the hub-and-spoke, mesh, or hybrid network topologies (discussed in
Chapter 2), creating VPNs that connect business partners and other branches of your own
organization raises a number of questions and considerations.
Each end of the VPN represents an extension of your corporate network to a new location;
you are, in effect, creating an extranet. An extranet is really an extension of your organiza-
tion’s network using the Internet. The same security measures you take to protect your own
network should be applied to the endpoints of the VPN. Each remote user or business part-
ner should have firewalls and antivirus software enabled, for instance.
An intranet is basically an internal network restricted to employees within the organiza-
tion, also using Internet technologies. VPNs can also be used to restrict access to other
areas of the intranet. For example, a large corporation that has facilities spread across several

locations can use a VPN to allow the IT staff in one location to monitor servers in the other
location, or accounting staff to adjust the financial records or job records in a server located
in another building. However, leaving the VPN connection “always on” can enable unscru-
pulous staff members to gain access to corporate resources they are not allowed to use.
Therefore, VPN users inside your organization should have usage limits and antivirus and
firewall protection, just as outside users should, as shown in Figure 5-5.
VPN Components and Operations
Many telecommunications companies provide VPN services. VPNs can be set up with special
hardware or with firewall software that includes VPN functionality. Many firewalls have
VPN systems built into them, because the rules that apply to the VPN are part of the firewall’s
existing security policy. When set up correctly, a VPN can become a critical component in an
organization’s perimeter security configuration.
The goal of VPNs is to provide a cost-effective and secure way to connect business loca-
tions to one another and connect remote workers to office networks. When each remote

branch office has a secure connection to the central office using a VPN, all branches can com-
municate via a higher-level Application-layer protocol that cannot normally be routed over the
Internet, like Windows’ use of NetBIOS or Mac OS X’s use of AppleTalk for resource sharing.
VPN Components VPNs consist of two different types of components: hardware devices
and the software that performs security-related activities. This section briefly discusses the com-
ponents of a VPN.
Each VPN tunnel has two endpoints or terminators. Endpoints are hardware devices or soft-
ware modules that perform encryption to secure data, perform authentication to make sure
the host requesting the data is an approved user of the VPN, and perform encapsulation to
protect the integrity of the information being sent.
A VPN connection occurs within the context of a TCP/IP tunnel. A tunnel is a channel or
pathway over a packet network used by the VPN; it runs through the Internet from one
endpoint to another. The term “tunnel” can be misleading, because it implies that there is
a single cable joining one endpoint to another and that no one but approved users can
send or receive data using that cable. In reality, a VPN uses a virtual tunnel between two
endpoints; this virtual tunnel makes use of Internet-based hosts and servers to conduct
data from one network station to another, just as with any other TCP/IP data transmission.
Although using the Internet’s system of networks, subnetworks, and servers makes it relatively
easy to set up a VPN, it also adds a level of uncertainty to VPN communications because so
many systems are involved.
In drawings of networks that employ VPNs, you’ll often see a single line used to join the
two endpoints, as shown in Figure 5-6. This very simplified picture illustrates that a VPN is
essentially a communications path through the Internet that provides a heightened degree
of security for two participants.
Figure 5-7, on the other hand, illustrates that VPNs in fact traverse the public Internet and
must therefore handle the Internet’s protocols and procedures. The figure shows one set of
endpoints for a VPN: routers that support Internet Security Protocol (IPSec). Each LAN’s
communications first go to its ISP’s server, then to a network access point (a point that is on
a high-speed part of the Internet called the backbone) and several intermediate servers.
Figure 5-8 shows a typical configuration used for VPN services. You may notice that it is
more complicated because the ISPs involved may or may not be connected to the Internet
backbone, and there are probably more than three servers lying between one LAN and the
other. Not only that, more than one VPN may be involved when different offices that are
part of the same corporate network attempt to share information. Figure 5-8 illustrates the
complexity of the Internet environment in which VPNs are deployed.
The devices that form the endpoints of the VPN (they are often said to “terminate” the VPN)
can be one of the following:
●
A server running a tunneling protocol
●
A VPN appliance, which is a special hardware device devoted to setting up VPN
communications
●
A firewall/VPN combination. Many high-end firewall programs support VPN setups
as part of their built-in features.

A router-based VPN. Routers that support IPSec can be set up at the perimeter of
the LANs to be connected. These are sometimes called IPSec concentrators, and they
use a complex set of security protocols to protect information, including Internet Key
Exchange (IKE), which provides for the exchange of security keys between the
machines in the VPN.
The final component in a VPN scenario is a certificate server, which manages certificates,
if they are required, and manages client computers that run VPN client software; this lets
remote users connect to the LAN over the VPN.
Essential Activities of VPNs
Because the VPN uses the Internet to transfer information from one computer or LAN to
another, the data needs to be well protected. The essential activities that protect data transmit-
ted over a VPN are IP encapsulation, data payload encryption, and encrypted authentication.

IP Encapsulation You already know from Chapter 2 that information passing to and
from TCP/IP-based networks travels in manageable chunks called packets. VPNs protect
packets by performing IP encapsulation, the process of enclosing a packet within another
one that has different IP source and destination information.
Encapsulating IP packets within other packets hides the source and destination information of
the encapsulated packets; the encapsulating packet uses the source and destination addresses

of the VPN gateway. In the cases where a VPN tunnel is being used, the source and destina-
tion IP addresses of the encapsulated packets can be in the private reserved blocks that are
not usually routable over the Internet, such as the 10.0.0.0/8 addresses or the 192.168.0.0/16
reserved network blocks.
Data Payload Encryption One of the big benefits of using VPNs is that they can be
implemented to fully or partially encrypt the data portion of the packets that are passing
through them. The encryption can be accomplished in one of two ways:

●
Transport method—The host encrypts traffic when it is generated; the data parts of
packets are encrypted, but not the headers.
●
Tunnel method—The traffic is encrypted and decrypted in transit, somewhere between
the source computer that generated it and its destination. In addition, both the header
and the data portions of packets are encrypted.
Figure 5-9 illustrates a simple view of IP encapsulation using both the transport and tunneling
methods discussed in the next section.
These techniques were illustrated in Figure 5-7. The level of encryption applied by the firewall
or VPN hardware device varies: The higher the number of data bits used to generate keys, the
stronger the encryption. As you’ll recall from Chapter 3, a key is the value used by the crypto-
graphic formula or algorithm to either produce or decrypt ciphertext. The length of a key
affects the strength of the encryption.
Encrypted Authentication Some VPNs use the term encryption domain to describe
everything in the protected network behind the gateway. The same cryptographic system
that protects the information within packets can be used to authenticate computers that use
the VPN. Authentication is essential because hosts in the network that receive VPN commu-
nications need to know that the host originating the communications is an approved user of
the VPN.

Types of VPNs
There are two types of VPN setups. The first type links two or more networks and is called a
site-to-site VPN. The second type makes a network accessible to remote users who need
dial-in access; it is called a client-to-site VPN. The two types of VPNs are not mutually
exclusive; many large corporations link the central office to one or more branch locations
using site-to-site VPNs while providing dial-in access to the central office by means of a
client-to-site VPN.
Because of their cost-effectiveness, VPNs are growing steadily in popularity. Accordingly, you
can choose among a number of options for configuring VPNs—various hardware systems
and software systems as well as hybrids that combine hardware and software. When choos-
ing a system, keep in mind that any type of VPN, whether it consists of hardware or software
or both, needs to be able to work with any number of different operating systems or types of
computers.
VPN Appliances
One way to set up a VPN is to use a hardware device, such as a router that has been config-
ured to use IPSec or another VPN protocol. Another option is to obtain a VPN appliance, a
hardware device specially designed to terminate VPNs and join multiple LANs. VPN appli-
ances can permit connections among large numbers of users or multiple networks, but they
don’t provide other services, such as file sharing and printing.
Commercial VPN hardware devices (like those provided by Cisco, Checkpoint, and Sonic-
WALL) have a large number of VPN appliance options. At one end of the product spec-
trum is a product designed for a small business or a branch office. It can support multiple
(commonly 10, 25, or 50) simultaneous VPN connections along with stateful packet filter-
ing, NAT, and even antivirus protection. A Web-based interface and wizard installations
make these products good for basic VPN support and a minimal amount of management.
At the other end of the product spectrum are products that can support up to 500 concurrent
VPN connections at speeds greater than 1.5 Gbps. Designed to deliver a high-performance
VPN solution, these VPN products come with redundant power supplies that can be replaced
without turning the unit off. It provides mission-critical safety for large organizations that
need the highest level of security. Some of these products also feature an automatic backup
that enables dial-up connections using an external modem in the event of a service disruption
to ensure continuous connectivity.
The advantage of using a hardware VPN appliance (see Figure 5-10) is that it enables you to
connect more tunnels and users than software systems do. If the server goes offline or crashes
for some reason (as shown in the left half of the figure), the hardware VPN appliance doesn’t
go offline (as shown in the right half of the figure).
Software VPNs Software VPNs are generally less expensive than hardware systems, and
they tend to scale better on fast-growing networks. These products support: traveling employ-
ees who need private access to a corporate LAN or intranet from any dial-up location, IT staff
who need to secure internal networks and partition parts of the network, and corporate part-
ners who require secure connections to a company’s data network for business collaboration.
Most of these software-based applications support Windows, Linux, and Solaris SPARC
clients and servers as well as gateways.

Some software VPNs use policy manager systems for enterprise-wide software distribution,
policy creation, and management. Security settings for the entire corporate network using
VPN can be made from the administrator’s computer. Settings can be based on “role-
based policies.” This allows the creation of multiple configuration profiles for end users—for
example, “out-of-office,” “at-home,” or “in-office.” In addition, all installations and main-
tenance can usually be performed from a single central location.
Many software-based VPN applications are designed to integrate into existing directory
services such as Novell and Microsoft in order to simplify VPN management and adminis-
tration. These applications authenticate users through the directory service to ensure that
only authorized users are permitted to access the VPN. Administrators can control access
through the same interface used to manage other network users, as it is not necessary to
maintain a separate directory of information for VPN users.
An increasingly popular alternative for remote access to Web-enabled applications is SSL-
based VPNs. These VPNs make use of the SSL protocol (instead of IPSec) but only allow
access to Web-enabled applications.
VPN Combinations of Hardware and Software You may also use VPN systems
that implement a VPN appliance at the central network and use client software at the remote
end of each VPN connection. Several vendors (Cisco, for example) offer VPN concentrators
that come with a variety of features and capabilities. These VPN concentrators provide solu-
tions for the smallest office or branch location all the way up to the largest enterprise. Access

levels can be set either by individual user or by groups, which allows for easy configuration
and maintenance of company security policies.
Most VPN concentrator appliances give users the choice of operating in one of two modes: cli-
ent mode or network extension mode. In client mode, the concentrator acts as a software client,
enabling users to connect to another remote network via a VPN. In network extension mode,
the concentrator acts as a hardware device, enabling a secure site-to-site VPN connection.
You may have to operate a VPN system that is “mixed”—that is, one that uses hardware and
software from different vendors. You might have one company that issues certificates, another
that handles the client software, another that handles the VPN termination, and so on. The chal-
lenge is to get all these pieces to communicate with one another successfully. To do this, pick a
standard security protocol that is widely used and supported by all the devices, such as IPSec.
VPN Architectures
If there are only two participants in a VPN, the configuration is relatively straightforward in terms
of expense, technical difficulty, and time. When three or more networks or individuals need
to be connected, there are several options: a mesh, hub-and-spoke, or hybrid configuration.
Mesh Configuration In a mesh configuration, each participant (i.e., each network,
router, or computer) in the VPN has an approved relationship, called a security association
(SA), with every other participant. In configuring the VPN, you need to specifically identify
each of these participants to every other participant that uses the VPN. Before initiating a
connection, each VPN hardware or software terminator checks its routing table or SA table
to see if the other participant has an SA with it.
In Figure 5-11, four LANs are joined in a mesh VPN. Each LAN has the ability to establish
VPN communications with all the other participants in the LAN. If a new LAN is added to
the VPN, all other VPN devices must be updated to include information about the new users
in the LAN. Thus, each host can be added to the state table. In addition, every host that needs
to use the VPN in each of the LANs must be equipped with sufficient memory to operate the
VPN client software and to communicate with all other hosts in the VPN. The problem with
VPNs is the difficulty associated with expanding the network and updating every VPN device
whenever a host is added. That’s why, for fast-growing networks, a hub-and-spoke configura-
tion is preferable.
Hub-and-Spoke Configuration In a hub-and-spoke configuration, a single VPN
router contains records of all SAs in the VPN. Any LANs or computers that want to partici-
pate in the VPN need only connect to the central server, not to any other machines in the
VPN. This setup makes it easy to increase the size of the VPN as more branch offices or
computers are added. Figure 5-12 illustrates a hub-and-spoke configuration. Here, the cen-
tral VPN router resides at the organization’s central office because that is where the main
IT staff resides; this is the most common arrangement. A hub-and-spoke VPN is ideally
suited for communications within an organization that has a central main office and a num-
ber of branch offices.
The problem with hub-and-spoke VPNs is that this requirement that all communications flow
into and out of the central router slows down communications, especially if branch offices are
located on different continents around the world. In addition, the central router must have

double the bandwidth of other connections in the VPN because it must handle inbound and
outbound traffic at the same time. The high-bandwidth charge for such a router can easily
amount to several thousand dollars per month. However, in a situation where all communica-
tions need to go through the central office, a hub-and-spoke configuration makes sense
because of the heightened security it gives to all participants.
Hybrid Configuration As organizations grow, a VPN that starts out as a mesh config-
uration or a hub-and-spoke configuration often evolves into a mixture of the two. Mesh
configurations tend to operate more efficiently; therefore, the central core linking the most
important branches of the network should probably be a mesh configuration. However, as
branch offices are added, they can be added as spokes that connect to a central VPN router
at the central office.
Any time-critical communications with branch offices should be part of the mesh configu-
ration. However, far-flung offices, such as overseas branches, can be part of a hub-and-spoke
configuration. A hybrid setup that combines the two configurations benefits from the strengths
of each one—the scalability of the hub-and-spoke configuration and the speed of the mesh

configuration. If at all possible, try to have the branch offices that participate in the VPN
use the same ISP. That will minimize the number of “hops” between networks.
Tunneling Protocols Used with VPNs
In the past, firewalls that provided for the establishment of VPNs used proprietary
protocols—that is, protocols established by a single vendor and only implemented in that ven-
dor’s products. Such firewalls would only be able to establish connections with remote LANs
that used the same brand of firewall. Today, the widespread acceptance of IPSec with the IKE
system means that proprietary protocols are used far less often.

IPSec/IKE Developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), IPSec is a standard for
secure encrypted communications. It provides for (1) encryption of the data part of packets,
(2) authentication to guarantee that packets come from valid sources, and (3) encapsulation
between two VPN hosts.
IPSec utilizes two security methods: Authenticated Headers (AH) and Encapsulating Security
Payload (ESP). AH is used to authenticate packets, whereas ESP encrypts the data portion of
packets. The two methods can be combined.
IPSec works in two different modes: transport mode and tunnel mode. Transport mode is
used to provide secure communications between hosts over any range of IP addresses.
Tunnel mode is used to create secure links between two private networks. Tunnel mode is
the obvious choice for VPNs; however, there are some concerns about using tunnel mode
in a client-to-site VPN because IPSec by itself does not provide for user authentication.
However, when combined with an authentication system like Kerberos, IPSec can authen-
ticate users.
IPSec is commonly combined with IKE as a means of using public-key cryptography to
encrypt data between LANs or between a client and a LAN. IKE provides for the exchange
of public and private keys. The key exchange is used to tell the hosts wishing to initiate a
VPN connection that each is a valid user of the system. IKE can also determine which encryp-
tion protocols should be used to encrypt data that flows through the VPN tunnel. The process
of establishing an IPSec/IKE VPN connection works as follows:
1.
The host or gateway at one end of the VPN sends a request to a host or gateway at the
other end asking to establish a connection. (Both hosts have obtained the same key,
called a preshared key, from the same trusted authority.)
2.
The remote host or gateway generates a random number and sends a copy of the num-
ber back to the machine that made the original request.
3.
The original machine encrypts its preshared key using the random number and sends
the preshared key to the remote host or gateway.
4.
The remote host decrypts the preshared key and compares it to its own preshared key
or, if it has multiple keys, to a set of keys called a keyring. If the preshared key matches
one of its own keys, the remote host encrypts a public key using the preshared key and
sends it back to the machine that made the original request.
5.
The original machine uses the public key to establish a security association (SA) between
the two machines, which establishes the VPN connection.
Even though many firewalls support IPSec and IKE, they sometimes use different versions of
these protocols. If your VPN uses more than one kind of firewall and you plan to implement
an IPSec/IKE VPN, check with the manufacturers of those firewalls to see if their products will
work with the other firewalls you have, and ask about any special configuration you have to
perform.
PPTP Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is commonly used by remote users who
need to connect to a network using a dial-in modem connection. PPTP uses Microsoft Point-
to-Point Encryption (MPPE) to encrypt data that passes between the remote computer and the
remote access server. It’s an older technology than the other dial-in tunneling protocol, L2TP,
but it is useful if support for older clients is needed. It’s also useful because packets sent using

PPTP can pass through firewalls that perform NAT. This is in contrast to L2TP, which is
incompatible with NAT but provides a higher level of encryption and authentication.
L2TP Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is an extension of PPP. It uses IPSec rather than
MPPE to encrypt data sent over PPP. It provides secure authenticated remote access by sep-
arating the process of initiating a connection from the process of forwarding the data encap-
sulated in PPP communications. Using L2TP, a host machine can make a connection to a
modem and then have its PPP data packets forwarded to another, separate remote access server.
When the data reaches the remote access server, its payload is unpacked and forwarded to the
destination host on the internal network.
PPP over SSL/PPP over SSH Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over Secure Shell (SSH) are two UNIX-based meth-
ods for creating VPNs. Both combine an existing tunnel system (PPP) with a way of encrypt-
ing data in transport (SSL or SSH). As you probably know already, PPP can be used to
establish a connection between two hosts over an IP system.
SSL is a public-key encryption system used to provide secure communications over the World
Wide Web. (See Chapter 7 for more on SSL). SSH is the UNIX secure shell, which was devel-
oped when serious security flaws were identified in Telnet. SSH enables users to perform
secure authenticated logons and encrypted communications between a client and host. SSH
can be configured so that it requires that both client and host have a secret key in advance—
a preshared key—in order to establish a connection.
Which protocol should you use in a VPN you establish, and why? Table 5-5 lists the proto-
cols mentioned in this section along with situations in which they might be used.
VPN Best Practices
The successful operation of a VPN depends not only on its hardware and software compo-
nents and overall configuration but also on a number of best practices. These include security
policy rules that specifically apply to the VPN, the integration of firewall packet filtering with
VPN traffic, and auditing the VPN to make sure it is performing acceptably.

Need for a VPN Policy In a corporate setting, the VPN is likely to be used by many
different workers in many different locations. A VPN policy is essential for identifying
who can use the VPN and for ensuring that all users know what constitutes proper use of
the VPN. This can be a separate stand-alone policy, or it can be a clause within a larger
security policy.
The VPN policy should spell out who is permitted to have VPN access to your corporate net-
work. For example, vendors might be granted access to the network through a VPN connec-
tion, but they may only be allowed to access information pertaining to their own company’s
accounts. The vendor VPN solution should have controls that allow the administrator to
restrict where vendors can go on the corporate network. On the other hand, managers and
full-time employees who access the network through a VPN while traveling should be granted
more comprehensive access to network resources.
The VPN policy should also state whether authentication is to be used and how it is to be
used, whether split tunneling (two connections over a VPN line) is permitted, how long
users can be connected using the VPN at any one session, whether virus protection is
included, and so on. The SANS Institute is an information security research and education
organization; it provides a sample VPN policy at http://www.sans.org/security-resources/
policies/Virtual_Private_Network.pdf.
Packet Filtering and VPNs When configuring a VPN, you must decide early on where
data encryption and decryption will be performed in relation to packet filtering. You can
decide to do encryption and decryption either outside the packet-filtering perimeter or inside it.
Figure 5-13 shows encryption and decryption outside the packet-filtering perimeter.
In the scenario shown in Figure 5-13, the firewall/VPN combination is configured to perform
transport encryption. Packets are encrypted at the host as soon as they are generated. Packets
that are already encrypted pass through the packet filters at the perimeter of either LAN and
are not filtered. In this scenario, if the LAN that generates the communications has been
infected by a virus or is compromised in some way, the packets that pass through the packet
filters could be infected and could then infect the destination LAN.
Figure 5-14 illustrates the alternative: encryption and decryption performed inside the packet-
filtering perimeter using the tunnel method. Keep in mind that the network configurations
illustrated in this figure and in Figure 5-13 depict a packet filter that is separate from the fire-
wall; this is done for clarity of explanation. In fact, packet filtering might be done by the fire-
wall itself; the same firewall may provide VPN services, or a separate VPN appliance may be
used instead of a firewall-based VPN.
In Figure 5-14, packet filtering is performed before the data reaches the VPN. Mangled pack-
ets can be dropped before they reach the firewall/VPN, thus providing additional protection
for the destination LAN.
Benefits and Drawbacks of VPNs
One of the benefits of VPNs is secure networking without the expense of establishing and
maintaining leased lines. VPNs also allow the packet encryption/translation overhead to be
handled on dedicated systems, decreasing the load placed on production machines. They
also allow you to control the physical setup and, therefore, decide on data encryption levels
as well as decide whether to encrypt data at the physical level or at the application level.

VPNs do have some significant drawbacks. They are complex and, if configured improperly,
can create significant network vulnerabilities. Leased lines may be more expensive, but the
chance of introducing vulnerabilities is not as great because they create point-to-point con-
nections. VPNs also make use of the unpredictable and often unreliable Internet. Multina-
tional VPNs, in particular, can experience problems because packets being routed through
various hubs can encounter slowdowns or blockages that you can neither predict nor resolve.
You then have to explain to administration that the problem is occurring thousands of miles
away and they’ll just have to wait until it is fixed there.

Another problem involves authorization: If your VPN’s authorization is not configured prop-
erly, you can easily expose your corporate network. In addition, some vendor solutions have
more documented security issues than others.
VPNs Extend Network Boundaries High-speed Internet connections such as cable
modem and DSL lines are changing the role of VPNs in the corporate setting. Only a few
years ago, when high-speed connections were expensive and relatively hard to come by, remote
users primarily used VPNs to dial into a network using modems. They were connected to the
corporate network through the VPN only for the length of the dial-up connection. Because
many ISPs charged by the minute or placed restrictions on the number of hours a customer
could be connected each month, the remote user was likely to hang up as soon as business
was completed.
Now, it’s increasingly likely that the contractors, vendors, and telecommuters who connect to
an organization’s internal network through a VPN will have a high-speed connection that is
“always on.” Unless you specifically place limits on how long such employees can use the

VPN, they can be connected to your network around the clock. Thus, each VPN connection
extends your network to a location that is out of your control, and each such connection can
open up your network to intrusions, viruses, or other problems. You need to take extra care
with users who connect to the VPN through always-on connections. Here are some sugges-
tions for how to deal with the increased risk:
●
Multifactor authentication—As described earlier, this uses two or more authentication
factors to authenticate remote users. This means combining something the user pos-
sesses, such as a token or smart card, with something physically associated with the
user, such as fingerprints or retinal scans. For such a system to work, each remote
user needs to have a smart card reader, a fingerprint reader, a retinal scanner, or some
other (potentially expensive) device along with a computer.
●
Integrated virus protection—Make sure each user’s computer is equipped with
up-to-date antivirus software that scans the computer continually, screening out any
viruses as soon as they enter the system. After files are encapsulated, encrypted, and
sent through the VPN tunnel, any viruses in those files will make it through the
firewall into the corporate network. Virus-scanning software needs to be present on
the network to catch any viruses, of course; however, requiring vendors, partners,
or contractors to use their own antivirus software will reduce the chance of viruses
entering the system in the first place.
●
NAC—NAC solutions vary in complexity; some check for installed antivirus software,
current antivirus updates, and relevant security patches. More sophisticated solutions
can remediate identified defects by installing the appropriate items.5
●
Usage limits—VPNs should be configured to inform all VPN participants that they
need to terminate VPN sessions as soon as they are done with them. Configuration
of the VPN software can enforce the policy limits.
Such countermeasures should be supported by the organization’s security policies, and
requirements for their enforcement should be written into any agreements with business
partners or contractors. As with all security policies, they should be explained to employ-
ees and business partners during orientation and security awareness sessions.
Chapter Summary
■
Network security devices such as firewalls require authentication when they need to
assign different levels of authorization to different users and groups. By determining
that users or computers are really who or what they claim to be, the firewall can
then grant access to the needed network resources.
■
Network security devices can make use of many types of authentication schemes,
including user, client, and session authentication. In general, these schemes require
users to supply either something they have (such as a smart card) or something they
know (such as a password), or both. The most recent authentication systems measure
or evaluate a physical attribute, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint.
■
In a centralized authentication system, the firewall works in tandem with an
authentication server. The authentication server handles the maintenance (or generation)
of usernames and passwords as well as login requests and auditing, which is the process

of recording who is and who is not authenticated and what level of access is granted.
Kerberos is a centralized authentication system used for LAN authentication, whereas
TACACS+ and RADIUS are systems used to authenticate remote users who remotely
connect to the network.
■
Password management is an important part of virtually every authentication system.
It takes one of two forms:
●
Single-word, static passwords
●
One-time passwords generated dynamically each time the user attempts to log on
■
The growth and widespread use of the Internet has coupled with the use of encryption
technology to produce a solution for specific types of private communication channels:
virtual private networks (VPNs). VPNs provide a means of secure point-to-point
communications over the public Internet.
■
VPNs are used for e-commerce and telecommuting and are becoming widespread.
They can be set up with special hardware or with firewall software that includes VPN
functionality. Many firewalls have VPN systems built into them, and VPN is a critical
component in an organization’s perimeter security configuration.
■
Because the VPN uses the Internet to transfer information from one computer or LAN
to another, the data needs to be well protected. The essential activities that protect
data transmitted over a VPN are: IP encapsulation, data payload encryption, and
encrypted authentication.
■
There are two types of VPN: site-to-site and client-to-site. One way to set up a VPN is
to use a hardware device, such as a router that has been configured to provide a VPN
protocol, use a VPN appliance, or run VPN software on a general-purpose server.
■
VPN configuration for three or more networks or individuals results in combinations
of mesh, a hub-and-spoke arrangement, or a hybrid setup. In a mesh configuration,
each participant in the VPN has an approved relationship with every other participant.
In a hub-and-spoke configuration, a single, central VPN router contains records of
all associations in the VPN, and any other participants need only connect to the
central server, not to any other machines in the VPN. As organizations grow,
a VPN that starts out as a mesh design or hub-and-spoke design often evolves into a
mixture of the two.
■
Firewalls that use proprietary protocols can only establish connections with remote
LANs that use the same brand of firewall. Today, the widespread use of the IPSec
protocol with the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) system means that proprietary
protocols are used far less often. IPSec provides two security methods: Authenticated
Headers (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). AH is used to authenticate
packets, whereas ESP encrypts the data portion of packets. You can use the methods
together.
■
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is commonly used by remote users who
need to connect to a network using a dial-in modem connection. Layer 2 Tunneling
Protocol (L2TP) is an extension of the protocol long used to establish dial-up
connections on the Internet, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

■
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP) over Secure Shell (SSH) are two UNIX-based methods for creating
VPNs. Both of them combine an existing tunnel system (PPP) with a way of
encrypting data in transport (SSL or SSH).
■
A VPN is a good way to secure communications with users who need to connect
remotely by dialing into their ISP, or who use their cable or DSL Internet connections
to initiate the VPN connection. To enable a remote user to connect to a VPN, you
need to issue VPN client software to that user. You should make sure the user’s
computer is equipped with antivirus software and a firewall. You may need to obtain
a key for the remote user if you plan to use IPSec to make the VPN connection.
■
The successful operation of a VPN depends not only on its hardware and software
components and overall configuration but also on a number of best practices. These
include security policy rules that specifically apply to the VPN, the integration of
firewall packet filtering with VPN traffic, and auditing the VPN to make sure it is
performing acceptably.

Hands-On Projects
Project 5-1
In this project, we examine how users and groups are managed in Open-
SUSE. Managing users and groups is a common activity for security
professionals and administrators alike. User management will provide the
basis for access control and rights management. First, we will use the YaST GUI
utility provided by OpenSUSE, and then we will use command line applications.
To complete this project, you will need to have an installation of OpenSUSE available for
use. This can be achieved either by installing OpenSUSE on an available computer or by
building a virtual instance using virtualization software, such as Oracle’s VirtualBox or
VMware’s Player.
The instructions in this lab were verified on OpenSUSE 11.4. If you use another operating
system or version, your results may vary.

Introduction
As part of a prudent approach to keeping an eye on their networks, organizations
should consider continuous monitoring programs that involve two key components:
network-monitoring software, such as packet sniffers, and Intrusion Detection and
Prevention Systems (IDPSs).1 Network-monitoring software is the organization’s data
collection utility, whereas IDPSs provide the analysis component to detect any abnormal
activity or suspicious traffic.
Paige Davis had been given a mission from on high regarding the PCI audit. She was
to deploy an IDS solution that would monitor activities within the EBS IT infrastruc-
ture and provide the IT department with a better understanding of activity taking
place on the network. Paige’s first act was to deploy a network IDS that would
monitor the critical attack avenue from the Internet.
In teaming up with Noah Atwater, Paige was able to sketch out a rough plan.
Because management, out of fear, had authorized a “blank check” to purchase
network IDS equipment, Paige chose to use a commercial product from IBM, called
Proventia Network Intrusion Prevention System. She laid the foundation of the
infrastructure by deploying an appliance located on the main DMZ network
segment. The appliance would collect data from the network intrusion prevention
system
(NIPS)
sensors,

suspicious activity.
Paige then deployed a NIPS appliance at each of the critical network junctures
with the user network and servers. She also instituted authentication mechanisms so
that the sensors could prove their identity to the central collection point—Proventia
Management SiteProtector—and she instituted encryption so that the sensors could
pass back data without the fear of eavesdropping. This would be crucial because
Paige would have to allow communication through the internal firewall. Authentica-
tion and encryption would mitigate the overall risk of opening a door to the internal
network.
The final architecture gave Paige two important tools. First, any critical alerts could
be sent via pager to the IT team for an immediate response. Second, all data would
be archived, which would allow Paige to run reports presenting a view of the
malicious activity taking place on the network.

Network-Monitoring Software: Packet Sniffers
As you learned in Chapter 1, a packet sniffer (also known as a network sniffer) is a program
or device that can view data traversing a network. Sniffers can be used maliciously to intercept
usernames, passwords, and other sensitive transmitted information. However, sniffers have
long been used to help network administrators troubleshoot a variety of problems with
network communications. Also, sniffers have helped security administrators by monitoring
attacks on the network and helping prevent or remediate damage.
Capturing Network Traffic
Capturing network traffic is fairly easy. The simple concept is that enabling a network adapter
to communicate in promiscuous mode allows the adapter to then see all traffic, whether it is
destined to the host or not. Usually, network cards (also known as network interface cards or
NICs) operate in a mode in which they only receive and pass on traffic addressed to their
system. However, with appropriate privileges, a NIC can be reconfigured to pass on all received
traffic to allow the interception and viewing of that traffic. This is known as promiscuous
mode. (Enabling promiscuous mode differs by operating system and network device. Refer to
information provided by the vendor for more details on enabling promiscuous mode.) There
are, however, a number of considerations for capturing network traffic:
●
Capturing network traffic could be deemed illegal unless you are authorized by the
network owner to use a sniffer. Obtain permission first!
●
The computer must be placed on the proper network segment on which you want to
capture traffic. It does no good to place a sniffer on an Internet segment if your true
goal is to capture network traffic behind the border firewall.
●
In addition to knowing the network segment, you must do your homework on how your
sniffer is connected to the network. For example, if you are using a laptop to capture
network traffic, you cannot just connect it to a switch and expect to see all traffic on the
network segment, as a switch is smart enough to route traffic to the specific MAC address
destinations. More sophisticated switches have a spanning port or the ability to enable
switch port mirroring, which allows the administrator to connect one device to a desig-
nated port to view all traffic that flows through the switch. Alternatively, you can install
a hub, which typically does not apply the advanced switching techniques that prohibit one
station from viewing all traffic that passes through the device.
●
A sniffer cannot decipher encrypted traffic.
Packet Analysis
In order to use a sniffer effectively, the operator must understand the fundamental structure
of network packets. With this understanding, a security professional can make sense of what
type of traffic is being transmitted, who is sending, who is receiving, when the information is
being sent, and even what applications may be involved. This type of analysis is called packet
analysis, and it requires training on normal network packets, the RFC specifications, and
then training on spotting suspicious packets.
The first step in understanding how packet sniffers work is to understand normal
TCP/IP communications. As a quick review, Figure 6-1 displays the IP packet first shown in
Figure 2-16 in Chapter 2. This figure shows the various fields necessary in the IPv4 header

and where the transmitted data is stored. However, in this rendering, the packet has been
broken down by bit. This type of understanding is necessary when viewing network packets
in hexadecimal (hex) or other renderings that sniffers may provide. Additionally, Figure 6-2

IP headers are important, but it is also important to understand the structures for TCP
and UDP, which are encapsulated in IP packets. These headers transmit additional
information that is important for understanding more details about the nature of the data
traffic. Figures 6-3 and 6-4 detail these packet structures.
ICMP packets are another common traffic packet. Their structure is shown in Figure 6-5.
Tcpdump
Once you understand the structure of network packets and what you would expect to see in
normal TCP/IP communications, it is time to invest in learning a tool and its output format
to perform packet analysis. Because of its ubiquity in UNIX/Linux systems, tcpdump has
become the de facto standard in network sniffing. It was originally written by Van Jacobson,

Tcpdump—like many UNIX/Linux-based utilities—has a number of case-sensitive command
line options. Here are some useful options to get you started:
●
-i—Define network interface to use.
●
-r—Read network capture data from file.
●
-w—Write network capture data to file.
●
-n—Don’t convert addresses to names.
●
-c—Specify the number of packets to capture.
●
-A—Print data (without the link-level header) in ASCII.
●
-X—Print data (without the link-level header) in hex and ASCII.
●
-xx—Print data (with the link-level header) in hex.
The real power of tcpdump, however, comes in its ability to select which network packets to
capture. Tcpdump uses expressions to allow the operator to narrow down traffic. If no expressions
are used, then all network traffic is dumped. Here are a number of simple but useful expressions:
●
tcpdump host 192.168.1.100—Only captures traffic originating from and
destined to 192.168.1.100
●
tcpdump src 192.168.1.100—Only captures traffic originating from
192.168.1.100
●
tcpdump dst 192.168.1.100—Only captures traffic destined to
192.168.1.100
●
tcpdump net 192.168.1.0/24—Only captures traffic destined to or originating
from the 192.168.1.0 network
●
tcpdump tcp—Only captures TCP traffic
●
tcpdump tcp and dst port 1025—Only captures TCP traffic destined to TCP
port 1025
●
tcpdump portrange 21-23—Only captures traffic destined to or originating from
ports 21, 22, or 23

Tcpdump Examples It is important to see examples in order to better understand tcpdump
output. By default, tcpdump will just print packet header information, as shown in Figure 6-6.
In Figure 6-6, two network packets are represented. The first shows the host 192.168.1.124
sending host 192.168.1.2 an ICMP echo request. Host 192.168.1.2 replies shortly thereafter
with an ICMP echo reply. The first field lists a timestamp. The second field indicates that the
packet is IP. The third field shows the source IP address. The fourth field shows the
destination IP address. Following those standard fields in the tcpdump output, there is
additional information to indicate that ICMP is used and what message format is used.
In Figure 6-7, we see an FTP session initiation in which 192.168.253.128 sets up a session
with the FTP server at 192.168.1.13. In these series of packets—because we have communica-
tions over TCP—we also have TCP port information along with TCP flag information. In the
first packet, for example, we see the S indicator, which indicates the SYN flag being set in the
header of the packet. The second packet shows the S as well as the ack indicator. This shows
the second step in the three-way handshake for SYN/ACK. Finally, the third packet shows ack
to indicate the final step in session initiation. In addition, tcpdump shows the TCP session ID
numbers to help the operator line up packets to the individual TCP session communications.
Figure 6-8 shows off tcpdump’s ability to include not only the packet header information but
the packet contents. The tcpdump tool will output both the header and packet contents into
hex format. If we felt so inclined, we could decipher the hex content directly into packet header
information by referring to the RFC specifications for the various protocols. Although the

protocol diagrams seem overwhelming, using these blueprints helps to decipher the information
from a network sniffer. For example, the first hex 4 in Figure 6-8’s output indicates that we are
viewing IPv4. The 06 at position 19 and 20 indicates that TCP is encapsulated in the IP packet.
This type of information is deduced by mapping the packet positions to the hex output.
Additionally, we have the raw packet content. In this case, we have a large number of As being
sent to a Web server, which we deduce by the destination port of 80. This attack tries to exploit
a Microsoft Windows vulnerability in the ntdll.dll library, where the attack vector is WebDAV
using IIS.3 By using the hex output, we are able to understand that this packet is part of an attack
(or security test) on the network. This fundamental ability to decipher headers and peek into
packet contents forms the basis for modern network intrusion detection and prevention systems.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
An intrusion occurs when an attacker attempts to gain entry or disrupt the normal operations
of an information system, almost always with the intent to do harm. Even when such attacks
are self-propagating, as in the case of viruses and distributed denial-of-service attacks, they are
almost always instigated by an individual whose purpose is to harm an organization. Often,
the differences among intrusion types lies with the attacker. Some intruders don’t care which
organizations they harm and prefer to remain anonymous, whereas others crave notoriety.
Intrusion detection consists of procedures and systems that identify system intrusions.
Intrusion prevention consists of activities that deter an intrusion. Some important intrusion
prevention activities are writing and implementing good enterprise information security policy,
planning and performing effective information security programs, installing and testing
technology-based information security countermeasures (such as firewalls and intrusion

detection systems), and conducting and measuring the effectiveness of employee training and
awareness activities. Incident response (covered in more depth in Chapter 11) encompasses
the actions an organization takes when an intrusion is detected. These actions seek to limit
the loss from an intrusion and return operations to a normal state as rapidly as possible.
Incident management activities also finalize the restoration of operations to a normal state
and seek to identify the source and method of the intrusion in order to ensure that the same
type of attack cannot occur again—thus, reinitiating intrusion prevention.
Information security intrusion detection systems (IDSs) became commercially available in the
late-1990s. An IDS works like a burglar alarm in that it detects a violation (some system
activity analogous to an opened or broken window) and activates an alarm. This alarm can
be audible and/or visual (producing noise and lights, respectively), or it can be silent (an
e-mail message or pager alert). With almost all IDSs, system administrators can choose the
configuration of the various alerts and the alarm levels associated with each type of alert.
Many IDSs enable administrators to configure the systems to notify them directly of trouble
via e-mail or pagers. The systems can also be configured—again, like a burglar alarm—to
notify an external security service organization of a “break-in.” The configurations that enable
IDSs to provide customized levels of detection and response are quite complex. An extension
of IDS technology is the intrusion prevention system (IPS), which can detect an intrusion
and also prevent that intrusion from successfully attacking the organization by means of an
active response. Because the two systems often coexist, the combined term intrusion detection/
prevention system (IDPS) can be used to describe current anti-intrusion technologies.
IDPS Terminology
In order to understand IDPS operational behavior, you must first become familiar with some
IDPS terminology. The following is a list of common IDPS terms and definitions:
●
Alert or alarm—An indication that a system has detected a possible attack. IDPS
alerts and alarms take the form of audible signals, e-mail messages, pager
notifications, or pop-up windows.
●
Confidence—A value placed on an IDPS event’s ability to correctly detect and identify
certain types of attacks. The confidence value an organization places on the IDPS, IDPS
signatures, or specific events is based on experience and past performance measurements.
●
Evasion—The process by which an attacker changes the format of the network
packets and/or timing of their activities to avoid being detected by the IDPS.
●
Events—IDPS events that are accurate and noteworthy but do not pose a significant
threat to information security. Inappropriate system use, policy violations, and events
triggered by scanning and enumeration tools fall into this category.
●
False negative—The failure of an IDPS to react to an actual attack event. This is the most
grievous failure because the purpose of an IDPS is to detect and respond to attacks.
●
False positive—An alert or alarm that occurs in the absence of an actual attack.
A false positive can sometimes be produced when an IDPS mistakes normal system
activity for an attack. False positives tend to make users insensitive to alarms and,
thus, reduce their reactivity to actual intrusion events. Also referred to as noise.
●
Filtering—The process of reducing IDPS events in order to receive a better confidence in
the alerts received. For example, the administrator may set the IDPS to discard alarms

produced by false positives or normal network operations. Event filters are similar to
packet filters in that they can filter items by their source or destination IP addresses, but
they can also filter by operating systems, confidence values, alarm type, or alarm severity.
●
Tuning—The process of adjusting an IDPS to maximize its efficiency in detecting true
positives while minimizing both false positives and false negatives. This process may
also include grouping almost identical alarms that happen at close to the same time
into a single higher-level alarm. This consolidation reduces the number of alarms
generated, thereby reducing administrative overhead, and also identifies a relationship
among multiple alarms. This type of clustering may be based on combinations of
frequency, similarity in attack signature, similarity in attack target, or other criteria
that are defined by the system administrators.
Why Use an IDPS?
According to the NIST’s documentation on industry best practices, there are several
compelling reasons to acquire and use an IDPS:
●
To reduce the likelihood of bad behavior by making users and maybe even intruders
think they would be at a higher risk of discovery and punishment if they attacked or
otherwise abused the system
●
To detect attacks and other security violations that may not be prevented by other
security measures
●
To detect and react to common preambles of attacks (commonly experienced as
network probes and other “doorknob rattling” activities)
●
To document existing threats that may exist in an organization
●
To act as a quality control measure for the security design and ongoing operation of
security measures, especially for large and complex enterprises
●
To provide useful information about intrusions that do take place, allowing improved
diagnosis, recovery, and correction of causative factors4
One of the best reasons to install an IDPS is to provide an organization with overall situa-
tional awareness—or a better overall understanding—of the activities that take place on the
network. Without this type of technology, most IT and network administrators would not
have the detailed, real-time understanding of what attacks may be occurring at a given time.
Another reason to install an IDPS is to cover the organization when its network cannot
protect itself against known vulnerabilities or is unable to respond to a rapidly changing
threat environment. There are many factors that can delay or undermine an organization’s
ability to make its systems safe from attack and subsequent loss:
●
Even though popular information security technologies such as scanning tools allow
security administrators to evaluate the readiness of their systems, they may still fail to
detect or correct a known deficiency, or they may perform the vulnerability detection
process too infrequently.
●
When a vulnerability is detected in a timely manner, it cannot always be corrected
quickly. Because corrective measures usually require that the administrator install
patches and upgrades, addressing the vulnerabilities is subject to fluctuations in the
administrator’s workload.

●
To further complicate the matter, sometimes services known to be vulnerable
cannot be disabled or otherwise protected because they are essential to ongoing
operations.
At such times—that is, when there is a known vulnerability or deficiency in the system—an IDPS
can be set up to detect attacks or attempts to exploit existing weaknesses, thus becoming an
important part of the strategy of defense in depth to mitigate the overall risk to the business.
IDPSs can also help administrators detect the preambles to attacks. Most attacks begin with an
organized and thorough probing of the organization’s network environment and its defenses.
This initial estimation of the defensive state of an organization’s networks and systems is called
doorknob rattling and is conducted first through activities collectively known as footprinting
(which involves gathering information about the organization and its network activities and
assets), and then through another set of activities collectively known as fingerprinting (in which
network locales are scanned for active systems, and then the network services offered by the
host systems on that network are identified). A system capable of detecting the early warning
signs of footprinting and fingerprinting functions like a neighborhood watch that spots potential
burglars testing doors and windows; this enables administrators to prepare for a potential attack
or to take actions to minimize potential losses from an attack.
Another reason for acquiring an IDPS is threat documentation. The implementation of
security technology usually requires that project proponents document the threat from which
the organization must be protected. IDPSs are one means of collecting such data. (To collect
statistics measuring the types of attack information you could expect in support of an IDPS
implementation, you can begin with a freeware IDPS tool such as Snort.)
Data collected by an IDPS can also help management with quality assurance and continuous
improvement; they consistently pick up information about attacks that have successfully
compromised the outer layers of the network security architecture, such as a firewall or
another control. This information can be used to identify and repair emergent or residual
flaws in the security and network architectures and, thus, help the organization expedite its
incident response process and make other continuous improvements.
Finally, even if an IDPS fails to prevent an intrusion, it can still assist in the after-attack review by
providing information on how the attack occurred, what the intruder accomplished, and which
methods the attacker employed. This information can be used to remedy deficiencies and to
prepare the organization’s network environment for future attacks. The IDPS may also provide
forensic information that may be useful should the attacker be caught and prosecuted or sued.5
NIST SP 800-94 distinguishes between IPS and IDS as follows:
IPS technologies are differentiated from IDS technologies by one characteristic:
IPS technologies can respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it
from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which can be divided
into the following groups:
●
The IPS stops the attack itself. Examples of how this could be done are as follows:
●
Terminate the network connection or user session that is being used for the attack
●
Block access to the target (or possibly other likely targets) from the offending
user account, IP address, or other attacker attribute
●
Block all access to the targeted host, service, application, or other resource

●
The IPS changes the security environment. The IPS could change the configuration
of other security controls to disrupt an attack. Common examples are reconfi-
guring a network device (e.g., firewall, router, switch) to block access from the
attacker or to the target, and altering a host-based firewall on a target to block
incoming attacks. Some IPSs can even cause patches to be applied to a host if
the IPS detects that the host has vulnerabilities.
●
The IPS changes the attack’s content. Some IPS technologies can remove or
replace malicious portions of an attack to make it benign. A simple example is
an IPS removing an infected file attachment from an e-mail and then permitting
the cleaned email to reach its recipient. A more complex example is an IPS that
acts as a proxy and normalizes incoming requests, which means that the proxy
repackages the payloads of the requests, discarding header information. This
might cause certain attacks to be discarded as part of the normalization process.6
Types of IDPSs
IDPSs operate as network- or host-based systems and work together to protect the network,
as shown in Figure 6-9. A network-based IDPS is focused on protecting network information
assets. Two specialized subtypes of network-based IDPS are the wireless IDPS and the
network behavior analysis (NBA) IDPS. The wireless IDPS focuses on wireless networks, as
the name indicates, whereas the NBA IDPS examines traffic flow on a network in an attempt
to recognize abnormal patterns like DDoS, malware, and policy violations.
A host-based IDPS protects the server or host’s information assets by monitoring both network
connection activity and current information states on host servers. The application-based model

works on one or more host systems that support a single application and defends that specific
application from special forms of attack.
Network-Based IDPS A network-based IDPS (NIDPS) resides on a computer or
appliance connected to a segment of an organization’s network and monitors network traffic on
that network segment—much like tcpdump—looking for indications of ongoing or successful
attacks. When the NIDPS identifies activity that it is programmed to recognize as an attack, it
responds by sending notifications to administrators. When examining incoming packets, an
NIDPS looks for patterns within network traffic, such as large collections of related items of a
certain type, which could indicate that a denial-of-service attack is underway, or the exchange of
a series of related packets in a certain pattern, which could indicate that a port scan is in progress.
An NIDPS can detect many more types of attacks than a host-based IDPS, but it requires a much
more complex configuration and maintenance program.
As shown in Figure 6-10, an NIDPS is installed at a specific place in the network (such as on
the inside of an edge router) from where it is possible to monitor the traffic going into and out
of a particular network segment. The NIDPS can be deployed to monitor a specific grouping
of host computers on a specific network segment, or it may be installed to monitor all traffic
between the systems that make up an entire network.
When placed next to a hub, switch, or other key networking device, the NIDPS may use that
device’s monitoring port. The monitoring port, also known as a switched port analysis (SPAN)

port or mirror port, is a specially configured connection on a network device that is capable of
viewing all the traffic that moves through the entire device. In the early 1990s, before switches
became standard for connecting networks in a shared-collision domain, hubs were used. Hubs
receive traffic from one node and retransmit it to all other nodes. This configuration allows any
device connected to the hub to monitor all traffic passing through the hub. Unfortunately, it also
represents a security risk because anyone connected to the hub can monitor all the traffic that
moved through that network segment. Switches, on the other hand, create dedicated
point-to-point links between their ports. These links create a higher level of transmission security
and privacy, and they effectively prevent anyone from capturing, and thus eavesdropping on, the
traffic passing through the switch. Unfortunately, the ability to capture the traffic is necessary for
the use of an IDPS. Thus, monitoring ports are required. These connections enable network
administrators to collect traffic from across the network for analysis by the IDPS as well as for
occasional use in diagnosing network faults and measuring network performance.
Figure 6-11 shows a sample screen from SQueRT, a Web application used to query and
view event data generated by IDPS applications like the Snort Network IDPS Engine
(see www.snort.org) and OSSEC.
To determine whether an attack has occurred or is underway, NIDPSs compare measured
activity to known signatures in their knowledge base. This is accomplished by means of a
special implementation of the TCP/IP stack that reassembles the packets and applies protocol
stack verification, application protocol verification, or other verification and comparison
techniques.
In the process of protocol stack verification, the NIDPSs look for invalid data packets—that
is, packets that are malformed under the rules of the TCP/IP protocol. A data packet is
verified when its configuration matches that defined by the various Internet protocols. The
elements of these protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, and application layers such as HTTP) are
combined in a complete set called the protocol stack when the software is implemented in an
operating system or application. Many types of intrusions, especially DoS and DDoS attacks,
rely on the creation of improperly formed packets to take advantage of weaknesses in the
protocol stack in certain operating systems or applications.
In application protocol verification, the higher-order protocols (HTTP, FTP, Telnet) are
examined for unexpected packet behavior or improper use. Sometimes, an attack uses valid
protocol packets, but in excessive quantities (in the case of the Tiny Fragment Packet attack,
the packets are also excessively fragmented). Although the protocol stack verification looks
for violations in the protocol packet structure, the application protocol verification looks for
violations in the protocol packet use. One example of this kind of attack is DNS cache
poisoning, in which valid packets exploit poorly configured DNS servers to inject false
information to corrupt the servers’ answers to routine DNS queries from other systems on
the network. Unfortunately, this higher-order examination of traffic can have the same effect
on an IDPS as it can on a firewall—that is, it slows the throughput of the system. It may be
necessary to have more than one NIDPS installed, with one of them performing protocol
stack verification and one performing application protocol verification.
Advantages of operational NIDPSs include:
●
A smaller investment in NIDPS can often provide more coverage than the same
investment in HIDPS because good network design and placement of NIDPS devices
can enable an organization to use a few devices to monitor a large network.

NIDPSs operating in a detection-only mode can be deployed in existing networks with
little or no disruption to normal network operations.

NIDPSs are not usually susceptible to direct attack and, in fact, may not be detectable
by attackers.7
Disadvantages of operational NIDPSs include:
●
NIDPSs can become overwhelmed by network volume and fail to recognize attacks
they might otherwise have detected. Some IDPS vendors are accommodating the need
for ever-faster network performance by improving the processing of detection

algorithms in dedicated hardware circuits to gain a performance advantage.
Additional efforts to optimize rule set processing may also reduce NIDPSs’ overall
effectiveness in detecting attacks.
●
NIDPSs require access to all traffic that’s to be monitored. The broad use of switched
Ethernet networks has replaced the ubiquity of shared collision domain hubs. Since
many switches have limited or no monitoring port capability, some networks are not
capable of providing aggregate data for analysis by a NIDPS. Even when switches
do provide monitoring ports, they may not be able to mirror all activity with a con-
sistent and reliable time sequence.
●
NIDPSs cannot analyze encrypted packets, making some of the network traffic
invisible to the process. The increasing use of encryption that hides the contents of
some or all of the packet by some network services (such as SSL, SSH, and VPN)
limits the effectiveness of NIDPSs.
●
NIDPSs cannot reliably ascertain if an attack was successful or not. This requires the
network administrator to be engaged in an ongoing effort to evaluate the results of
the logs of suspicious network activity.
●
Some forms of attack are not easily discerned by NIDPSs, specifically those involving
fragmented packets. In fact, some NIDPSs are particularly susceptible to malformed
packets and may become unstable and stop functioning.8
Wireless IDPS A wireless IDPS monitors and analyzes wireless network traffic looking
for potential problems with the wireless protocols (layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model).
Products like Motorola’s AirDefense, Fluke’s AirMagnet, and the open-source Kismet have
to be deployed physically around the protected site in order to monitor the broad range of
wireless signals able to reach the facility. In many cases, this type of functionality can be
built into the wireless access point itself.
Wireless IDPS can help detect:
●
Unauthorized WLANs and WLAN devices
●
Poorly secured WLAN devices
●
Unusual usage patterns
●
Use of wireless network scanners
●
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and conditions
●
Impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks9
Sensors for wireless networks can be located at the access points, installed on specialized
sensor components, or incorporated into selected mobile stations. Centralized management
stations collect information from these sensors, much the same way that other network-
based IDPSs do, and aggregate the information into a comprehensive assessment of
wireless network intrusions. Issues associated with the implementation of wireless IDPSs
include:
●
Higher protocol monitoring—Wireless IDPSs cannot evaluate and diagnose issues
with higher-layer protocols like TCP and UDP. As such, Wireless IDPSs are unable
to detect certain passive wireless protocol attacks in which the attacker monitors
network traffic without active scanning and probing.

●
Physical security—Unlike wired network sensors, which can be physically secured, many
wireless sensors are located in public areas such as conference rooms, assembly areas, and
hallways in order to attain the widest possible network range. Some of these locations
may even be outdoors, as more and more organizations are deploying networks in
external locations. Thus, the physical security of these devices is an issue and is likely to
require additional security configuration and monitoring. The best configured IDPS in the
world cannot withstand an attack from a well-placed brick.10
●
Sensor range—A wireless device’s range can be affected by atmospheric conditions,
building construction, and the quality of both the wireless network card and access
point. Some IDPS tools allow an organization to identify the optimal location for
sensors by modeling the wireless footprint based on signal strength. Sensors are most
effective when their footprints overlap.
●
Access point and wireless switch locations—Wireless components with bundled IDPS
capabilities must be carefully deployed to optimize the IDPS sensor detection grid. The
minimum range is just that; you must guard against the possibility of an attacker
connecting to a wireless access point from a range far beyond the minimum.
●
Wired network connections—Wireless network components work independently of
the wired network when sending and receiving between stations and access points.
However, a network connection eventually integrates wireless traffic with the
organization’s wired network. Where there is no available wired network connection,
it may be impossible to deploy a sensor.
●
Cost—The more sensors deployed, the more expensive the configuration. Wireless
components typically cost more than wired counterparts; thus, the total cost of both
wired and wireless varieties should be carefully considered.11
Network Behavior Analysis System Network behavior analysis (NBA) systems
examine network traffic in order to identify problems related to the flow of traffic. They
use a version of the anomaly detection method described later in this section to identify
excessive packet flows such as might occur in the case of equipment malfunction, denial-
of-service attacks, virus and worm attacks, and some forms of network policy violations.
NBA IDPSs typically monitor internal networks but occasionally monitor connections
between internal and external networks. Typical flow data particularly relevant to intrusion
detection and prevention includes the following:
●
Source and destination IP addresses
●
Source and destination TCP or UDP ports or ICMP types and codes
●
Number of packets and bytes transmitted in the session
●
Starting and ending timestamps for the session12
Most NBA sensors can be deployed in passive mode only, using the same connection methods
(e.g., network tap, switch spanning port) as network-based IDPSs. Passive sensors that are
performing direct network monitoring should be placed so that they can monitor key network
locations, such as the divisions between networks, and key network segments, such as
demilitarized zone (DMZ) subnets. Inline sensors are typically intended for network perimeter
use, so they would be deployed in close proximity to the perimeter firewalls, often between
the firewall and the Internet border router to limit incoming attacks that could overwhelm the
the firewall.

The types of events most commonly detected by NBA sensors include the following:
●
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (including distributed denial-of-service [DDoS] attacks)
●
Scanning
●
Worms
●
Unexpected application services (e.g., tunneled protocols, backdoors, use of forbidden
application protocols)
●
Policy violations
NBA sensors offer various intrusion prevention capabilities, including the following (grouped
by sensor type):
●
Passive only, ending the current TCP session—A passive NBA sensor can attempt to
end an existing TCP session by sending TCP reset packets to both endpoints.
●
Inline only, performing inline firewalling—Most inline NBA sensors offer firewall
capabilities that can be used to drop or reject suspicious network activity.
●
Both passive and inline, reconfiguring other network security devices—Many NBA
sensors can instruct network security devices, such as firewalls and routers, to
reconfigure themselves to block certain types of activity or route it elsewhere, such as
to a quarantine virtual local area network (VLAN).
●
Running a third-party program or script—Some NBA sensors can run an
administrator-specified script or program when certain malicious activity is detected.13
Host-Based IDPS Whereas a network-based IDPS resides on a network segment and
monitors activities across that segment, a host-based IDPS resides on a particular computer
or server, known as the host, and monitors activity only on that system. HIDPSs are also
known as system integrity verifiers because they benchmark and monitor the status of key
system files and detect when an intruder creates, modifies, or deletes monitored files.14 An
HIDPS has an advantage over NIDPS in that it can be enabled to access encrypted information
that is decrypted at the system level and use it to make decisions about potential or actual
attacks. Also, because the HIDPS works on only one computer system, all the traffic it needs to
make decisions comes to the system on which the HIDPS is running. The nature of the network
packet delivery, whether switched or in a shared-collision domain, is not a factor.
A HIDPS is also capable of monitoring system configuration databases, such as Windows
registries or stored configuration files like .ini, .cfg, and .dat files. Most HIDPSs work on the
principle of configuration or change management, which means that they record the sizes,
locations, and other attributes of system files. The HIDPS triggers an alert when one of the
following occurs: file attributes change, new files are created, or existing files are deleted. A
HIDPS can also monitor systems logs for predefined events. The HIDPS examines these files
and logs to determine if an attack is underway or has occurred, and if the attack is succeeding
or was successful. The HIDPS maintains its own log file so that an audit trail is available even
when hackers modify files on the target system to cover their tracks.
Once properly configured, a HIDPS is very reliable. The only time it produces a false positive
alert is when an authorized change occurs for a monitored file. This action can be quickly
reviewed by an administrator, who may choose to disregard subsequent changes to the same

set of files. If properly configured, a HIDPS can also detect when users attempt to modify or
exceed their access authorization level.
A HIDPS classifies files into various categories and then sends notifications when
changes occur. Most HIDPSs provide only a few general levels of alert notification. For
example, an administrator can configure a HIDPS to report changes in a system folder
(e.g., in C:\Windows or C:\WINNT) and changes to a security-related application (such
as C:\TripWire). The configuration rules may classify changes to a specific application
folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\Office) as normal, and hence unreportable. Administrators
can configure the system to log all activity but to page them or e-mail them only if a
reportable security event occurs. Because internal application files (such as dictionaries and
configuration files) and data files are frequently modified, a poorly configured HIDPS can
generate a large volume of false alarms.
As shown in Figure 6-12, a managed HIDPS service can monitor multiple computers
simultaneously by creating a configuration file on each monitored host and by making
each HIDPS report back to a master console system, which is usually located on the
system administrator’s computer. This master console monitors the information pro-
vided by the managed hosts and notifies the administrator when it senses recognizable
attack conditions.

Advantages of HIDPSs include:
●
A HIDPS can detect local events on host systems and also detect attacks that may
elude a network-based IDPS.
●
A HIDPS functions on the host system, where encrypted traffic will have been
decrypted and is available for processing.
●
The use of switched network protocols does not affect a HIDPS.
●
A HIDPS can detect inconsistencies in how applications and systems programs were
used by examining the records stored in audit logs. This can enable it to detect some
types of attacks, including Trojan horse programs.15
Disadvantages of HIDPSs include:
●
HIDPSs pose more management issues because they are configured and managed on
each monitored host. This means that it requires more management effort to install,
configure, and operate a HIDPS than a comparably sized NIDPS solution.
●
A HIDPS is vulnerable both to direct attacks and to attacks against the host operating
system. Either circumstance can result in the compromising and/or loss of HIDPS
functionality.
●
A HIDPS is not optimized to detect multi-host scanning, nor is it able to detect the
scanning of non-host network devices, such as routers or switches. Unless complex
correlation analysis is provided, the HIDPS will not be aware of attacks that span
multiple devices in the network.
●
A HIDPS is susceptible to some denial-of-service attacks.
●
A HIDPS can use large amounts of disk space to retain the host OS audit logs; to
function properly, it may require that disk capacity be added to the system.
●
A HIDPS can inflict a performance overhead on its host systems and, in some cases,
may reduce system performance below acceptable levels.16
IDPS Detection Methods
IDPSs use a variety of detection methods to monitor and evaluate network traffic. Three
methods dominate: the signature-based approach, the statistical-anomaly approach, and the
stateful packet inspection approach.
Signature-Based IDPS A signature-based IDPS examines network traffic in search of
patterns that match known signatures—that is, preconfigured, predetermined attack
patterns. Signature-based IDPS technology is widely used because many attacks have clear
and distinct signatures. Examples include:
●
Footprinting and fingerprinting activities—Described in detail earlier in this chapter,
these have an attack pattern that includes the use of ICMP, DNS querying, and e-mail
routing analysis.
●
Exploits—These involve a specific attack sequence designed to take advantage of a
vulnerability to gain access to a system.
●
Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks—During
these, the attacker tries to prevent the normal usage of a system, which entails

overloading the system with requests so that the system’s ability to process them effi-
ciently is compromised/disrupted and it begins denying services to authorized users.17
The problem with the signature-based approach is that as new attack strategies are identified,
the IDPS’s database of signatures must be continually updated; otherwise, attacks that use
new strategies will not be recognized and might succeed. Another weakness of the signature-
based method is that a slow, methodical attack might escape detection if the relevant IDPS
attack signature has a shorter time frame. The only way for a signature-based IDPS to resolve
this vulnerability is for it to collect and analyze data over longer periods of time, a process
that requires substantially larger data storage capability and additional processing capacity.
Statistical Anomaly–Based IDPS The statistical anomaly–based IDPS (stat IDPS), or
behavior-based IDPS, collects statistical summaries by observing traffic that is known to be
normal. This normal period of evaluation establishes a performance baseline. Once the
baseline is established, the stat IDPS periodically samples network activity and, using
statistical methods, compares the sampled network activity to this baseline. When the
measured activity is outside the baseline parameters—exceeding what is called the clipping
level—the IDPS sends an alert to the administrator. The baseline data can include variables
such as host memory or CPU usage, network packet types, and packet quantities.
The advantage of the statistical anomaly-based approach is that the IDPS can detect new types
of attacks because it looks for abnormal activity of any type. Unfortunately, these systems
require much more overhead and processing capacity than signature-based IDPSs because
they must constantly compare patterns of activity against the baseline. Another drawback is
that these systems may not detect minor changes to system variables and may generate many
false positives. If the actions of the users or systems on a network vary widely, with periods of
low activity interspersed with periods of heavy packet traffic, this type of IDPS may not be
suitable because the dramatic swings from one level to another will almost certainly generate
false alarms. Because of its complexity and impact on the overhead computing load of the
host computer, as well as the number of false positives it can generate, this type of IDPS is
less commonly used than the signature-based type.
Stateful Protocol Analysis IDPS As you learned in Chapter 4, stateful inspection
firewalls track each network connection between internal and external systems using a state
table to record which station sent which packet and when, essentially pairing communicat-
ing parties. An IDPS extension of this concept is stateful protocol analysis. According to SP
800-94, “Stateful protocol analysis (SPA) is a process of comparing predetermined profiles
of generally accepted definitions of benign activity for each protocol state against observed
events to identify deviations. Stateful protocol analysis relies on vendor-developed universal
profiles that specify how particular protocols should and should not be used.”18 Essentially,
the IDPS knows how a protocol, such as FTP, is supposed to work and, therefore, can
detect anomalous behavior. By storing relevant data detected in a session and then using
that data to identify intrusions that involve multiple requests and responses, the IDPS can
better detect specialized, multi-session attacks. This process is sometimes called deep packet
inspection because SPA closely examines packets at the Application layer for information
that indicates a possible intrusion.
SPA can also examine authentication sessions for suspicious activity, as well as for attacks that
incorporate “unexpected sequences of commands, such as issuing the same command repeatedly

or issuing a command without first issuing a command upon which it is dependent, as well as
‘reasonableness’ for commands such as minimum and maximum lengths for arguments.”19
The models used for SPA are similar to signatures in that they are provided by vendors. These
models are based on industry protocol standards established by such entities as the Internet
Engineering Task Force, but they vary along with the protocol implementations in such
documents. Also, proprietary protocols are not published in sufficient detail to enable the
IDPS to provide accurate and comprehensive assessments.
Unfortunately, this type of IDPS method has a drawback: the analytical complexity of session-
based assessments, which is further complicated by the amount of processing overhead in
tracking multiple, simultaneous connections. Additionally, unless the protocol violates its
fundamental behavior, this type of IDPS method may completely fail to detect the intrusion.
One final issue is the possibility that the IDPS may in fact cause problems with the protocol
it’s examining, especially with client- and server-differentiated operations.20
Log File Monitors A log file monitor (LFM) IDPS is similar to an NIDPS. Using LFM,
the system reviews the log files generated by servers, network devices, and even other IDPSs,
looking for patterns and signatures that may indicate that an attack or intrusion is in
process or has already occurred. Although an individual host IDPS is only able to examine
the activity in one system, the LFM is able to look at multiple log files from a number of
different systems. The patterns that signify an attack can be subtle and hard to distinguish
when one system is examined in isolation, but they may be much easier to identify when
the entire network and its systems are viewed. Of course, this holistic approach requires the
allocation of considerable resources because it involves the collection, movement, storage,
and analysis of very large quantities of log data.
IDPS Response Behavior
IDPSs responds to external stimulation in different ways, depending on their configurations
and functions. Some respond in active ways, collecting additional information about the
intrusion, modifying the network environment, or even taking action against the intrusion.
Others respond in passive ways—for example, by setting off alarms or notifications or by
collecting passive data through SNMP traps.
IDPS Response Options When an IDPS detects possible intrusion, it has a number of
response options, depending on the implementing organization’s policy, objectives, and
system capabilities. When configuring an IDPS’s responses, the system administrator must
exercise care to ensure that a response to an attack (or potential attack) does not inadver-
tently exacerbate the situation. For example, if an NIDPS reacts to suspected DoS attacks
by severing the network connection, the attack is a success, and such attacks repeated at
intervals will thoroughly disrupt an organization’s business operations.
An analogy to this approach would be the case of a potential car thief who walks up to a
desirable target in the early hours of the morning, strikes the car’s bumper with a rolled-up
newspaper, and then ducks into the bushes. When the car alarm is triggered, the car owner
wakes up, checks the car, determines there is no danger, resets the alarm, and goes back to
bed. The thief repeats the triggering actions every half hour or so until the owner disables the
alarm. The thief is now free to steal the car without worrying about triggering the alarm.

IDPS responses can be classified as active or passive. An active response is a definitive action
automatically initiated when certain types of alerts are triggered; this can include collecting
additional information, changing or modifying the environment, or taking action against the
intruders. Passive response IDPSs simply report the information they have collected and wait
for the administrator to act. Generally, the administrator chooses a course of action after
analyzing the collected data. The passive IDPS is the most common implementation, although
most systems allow some active options that are disabled by default.
The following list illustrates some of the responses an IDPS can be configured to produce.
Note that some of these apply only to a network-based or a host-based IDPS, whereas others
are applicable to both.21
●
Audible/visual alarm—The IDPS can trigger a .wav file, beep, whistle, siren, or other
audible or visual notification to alert the administrator of an attack. The most common
type of such notifications is the computer pop-up window. This display can be configured
with color indicators and specific messages, and it can also contain specifics about the
suspected attack, the tools used in the attack, the level of confidence the system has in its
own determination, and the addresses and/or locations of the systems involved.
●
SNMP traps and plug-ins—The Simple Network Management Protocol contains trap
functions, which allow a device to send a message to the SNMP management console
indicating that a certain threshold has been crossed, either positively or negatively. The
IDPS can execute this trap, telling the SNMP console an event has occurred. Some of the
advantages of this operation include the relatively standard implementation of SNMP in
networking devices, the ability to configure the network system to use SNMP traps in this
manner, the ability to use systems specifically to handle SNMP traffic, including IDPS
traps, and the ability to use standard communications networks.
●
E-mail message—The IDPS can e-mail an individual to notify him or her of an event.
Many administrators use personal digital assistants (PDAs) to check their e-mail frequently.
Organizations should use caution in relying on e-mail systems as the primary means of
communication between the IDPS and security personnel; e-mail is inherently unreliable,
and an attacker could compromise the e-mail system and block such messages.
●
Text or phone message—The IDPS can be configured to dial a phone number and
produce an alphanumeric text or leave a message.
●
Log entry—The IDPS can enter information about the event (addresses, time, systems
involved, protocol information, etc.) into an IDPS system log file or operating system
log file. These files can be stored on separate servers to prevent skilled attackers from
deleting entries about their intrusions.
●
Evidentiary packet dump—Organizations that require an audit trail of the IDPS data may
choose to record all log data in a special way. This method allows the organization to
perform further analysis on the data and also to submit the data as evidence in a civil or
criminal case. Once the data has been written using a cryptographic hashing algorithm
(discussed in detail in Chapter 3), it becomes evidentiary documentation—that is, suitable
for criminal or civil court use. This packet logging can, however, be resource-intensive,
especially in denial-of-service attacks.
●
Take action against the intruder—It has become possible, though not advisable, to
take action against an intruder. Known as trap and trace, back-hacking, or traceback,
this response option involves configuring intrusion detection systems to trace the data

from the target system to the attacking system in order to initiate a counterattack.
Although this may sound tempting, it is ill-advised and may not be legal. An
organization only owns a network to its perimeter, and conducting traces or back-
hacking to systems outside that perimeter may make the organization just as
criminally liable as the individual(s) who began the attack. Also, in some cases the
“attacking system” is in fact a compromised intermediary system, and in other cases
attackers use address spoofing; either way, any counterattack would actually only harm an
innocent third party. Any organization planning to configure any sort of retaliation effort
into an automated intrusion detection system is strongly encouraged to seek legal counsel.
●
Launch program—An IDPS can be configured to execute a specific program when it
detects specific types of attacks. A number of vendors have specialized in tracking, tracing,
and response software that could be part of an organization’s intrusion response strategy.
●
Reconfigure firewall—An IDPS could send a command to the firewall to filter out
suspected packets by IP address, port, or protocol using one of the following methods:
●
Establishing a block for all traffic from the suspected attacker’s IP address, or even
from the entire source network from which the attacker appears to be operating.
This blocking might be set for a specific period of time and be reset to normal
rules after that period has expired.
●
Establishing a block for specific TCP or UDP port traffic from the suspected attacker’s
address or source network, blocking only the services that seem to be under attack.
●
Blocking all traffic to or from a network interface (such as the organization’s Internet
connection) if the severity of the suspected attack warrants that level of response.22
●
Terminating the session by using the TCP/IP protocol specified as packet TCP
close. This is a simple process, and some attacks would be deterred or blocked by
session termination, but others would simply continue when the attacker issues a
new session request.
●
Terminating the organization’s internal or external connections should be the last
resort for an IDPS under attack, given that terminating network connections may
be exactly what the attacker wants. Smart switches can cut traffic to/from a spe-
cific port, should that connection be linked to a system that is malfunctioning or
otherwise interfering with efficient network operations.
It is, unfortunately, still possible for a skilled attacker to break in by simply spoofing a different
address, shifting to a different port, or changing the protocols used in the attack.
Reporting and Archiving Capabilities Many, if not all, commercial IDPSs provide
capabilities to generate routine reports and other detailed information documents. Some of these
can output reports of system events and intrusions detected over a particular reporting period
(e.g., a week or a month). Some provide statistics or logs generated by the IDPSs in formats
suitable for inclusion in database systems or for use in report generating packages.23
Fail-Safe Considerations for IDPS Responses When choosing an IDPS product,
you must consider the fail-safe features of the IDPS design or product. Fail-safe features
protect the IDPSs from being circumvented or defeated by an attacker. There are several
areas that require fail-safe measures. For instance, IDPSs need to provide silent, reliable
monitoring of attackers. Should the response function of an IDPS break this silence by

broadcasting alarms and alerts in plaintext over the monitored network, attackers can detect
the presence of the IDPS and might then directly target the IDPS as part of the attack.
Encrypted tunnels or other cryptographic measures that hide and authenticate IDPS commu-
nications are excellent ways to secure and ensure the reliability of the IDPS.24
Selecting IDPS Approaches and Products
The wide array of intrusion detection products available today addresses a broad range of organi-
zational security goals and considerations; the process of selecting products that represent the best
fit for any particular organization is challenging. The following considerations and questions may
help you prepare a specification for acquiring and deploying an intrusion detection product.25
Technical and Policy Considerations In order to determine which IDPS best meets
an organization’s needs, first consider the organizational environment in technical, physical,
and political terms.
What Is Your System’s Environment? The first hurdle a potential IDPS must clear is
functioning in your systems environment. This is important; if an IDPS is not designed to
accommodate the information sources that are available on your systems, it will not be able
to see anything that goes on—neither normal activity nor an attack—in your systems. When
considering an IDPS product, you must ask yourself the following questions:
●
What are the technical specifications of your systems environment?—First, specify the
technical attributes of your systems environment. These include: the number and locations
of hosts, as specified by network diagrams and maps; operating systems for each host; the
number and types of network devices, such as routers, bridges, and switches; the number
and types of terminal servers and dial-up connections; and descriptors of any network
servers, including types, configurations, and application software and versions running on
each. If you run an enterprise network management system, specify it here.
●
What are the technical specifications of your current security protections?—Describe
the security protections you already have in place. Specify numbers, types, and
locations of network firewalls, identification and authentication servers, data and link
encryptors, antivirus packages, access control products, specialized security hardware
(such as crypto accelerator hardware for Web servers), virtual private networks, and
any other security mechanisms on your systems.
●
What are the goals of your enterprise?—Some IDPSs have been developed to
accommodate the special needs of certain industries or market niches such as
electronic commerce, health care, or financial services. Define the functional goals of
your enterprise (there can be several goals associated with a single organization) that
are supported by your systems.
●
How formal is the system environment and management culture in your organization?—
Organizational styles vary, depending on the function of the organization and its
traditional culture. For instance, the military and other organizations that deal with
national security issues tend to operate with a high degree of formality, especially
when contrasted with university or other academic environments. Some IDPSs
support enforcement of formal use policies, with configuration options built into
them by the manufacturer that can handle the particulars from commonly used

issue-specific security policies or system-specific security policies, as well as provide
a library of reports for commonly encountered policy violations, along with other
reporting capabilities.26
What Are Your Security Goals and Objectives? Once you’ve specified the technical
landscape of your organization’s systems as well as its existing security mechanisms, it’s time to
articulate the goals and objectives you wish to attain by using an IDPS. Ask yourself the following:
●
Is the organization’s primary goal protecting itself from threats originating outside the
organization?—Perhaps the easiest way to identify security goals is by categorizing
your organization’s threat concerns. Identify the various concerns your organization
has regarding external threats.
●
Is your organization more concerned about an insider attack—that is, threats
originating within the organization?—This can encompass not only a user who
attacks the system from within (such as a shipping clerk who attempts to access and alter
the payroll system) but also the authorized external user who exceeds his privileges, thereby
violating organizational security policy or laws (such as a customer service agent who,
driven by curiosity, accesses earnings and payroll records for public figures).
●
Does your organization want to use the output of your IDPS to determine new needs?—
System usage monitoring is sometimes provided as a generic system management
tool to determine when system assets require upgrading or replacement. When such
monitoring is performed by an IDPS, the needs for upgrade can show up as anoma-
lous levels of user activity.
●
Does your organization want to use an IDPS to maintain managerial control
(non-security-related) over network usage?—In some organizations, there are system
use policies that may be classified as personnel management rather than system
security issues. These might include accessing questionable Web sites (such as ones
containing pornography) or using organizational systems to send e-mail or other
messages for the purpose of harassing individuals. Some IDPSs provide features that
detect such violations of management controls.27
What Is Your Existing Security Policy? At this time, you should review your existing
organization security policy. This will serve as the template against which the features of
your IDPS will be configured. During your review, look for the following items (or augment
the policy if these items do not exist):
●
How is it structured?—It is helpful to articulate the goals outlined in the security policy in
terms of the standard security goals (integrity, confidentiality, and availability) as well as in
terms of more generic management goals (privacy, protection from liability, manageability).
●
What are the general job descriptions of your system users?—List the general job
functions of system users (there are commonly several functions assigned to a single
user), as well as the data and network accesses that each function requires.
●
Does the policy include reasonable use policies or other management provisions?—As
mentioned earlier, many organizations have system use policies included as part of
security policies.
●
Has your organization defined processes for dealing with specific policy violations?—
It is helpful to have a clear idea of what the organization wishes to do when the IDPS

detects that a policy has been violated. If the organization doesn’t intend to react to
such violations, it may not make sense to configure the IDPS to detect them. If, on the
other hand, the organization wishes to actively respond to such violations, the IDPS’s
operational staff should be informed of the response policy so that they can deal with
alarms in an appropriate manner.28
Organizational Requirements and Constraints Your organization’s operational
goals, constraints, and culture will affect the selection of the IDPS and other security tools and
technologies to protect your systems. Here are some questions to ask:29
What Requirements Are Levied from Outside the Organization?
●
Is your organization subject to oversight or review by another organization? If so,
does that oversight authority require IDPSs or other specific system security resources?
●
Are there requirements for public access to information on your organization’s systems?
Do regulations or statutes require that information on your system be accessible by the
public during certain hours of the day or during certain date or time intervals?
●
Are there other security-specific requirements levied by law? Are there legal require-
ments for protection of personal information (such as earnings information or medical
records) stored on your systems? Are there legal requirements for investigation of
security violations that divulge or endanger that information?
●
Are there internal audit requirements for security best practices or due diligence? Do any
of these audit requirements specify functions that the IDPSs must provide or support?
●
Is the system subject to accreditation? If so, what is the accreditation authority’s
requirement for IDPSs or other security protection?
●
Are there requirements for law enforcement investigation and resolution of security
incidents? Do these specify any IDPS functions, especially those having to do with
collection and protection of IDPS logs as evidence?30
What Are Your Organization’s Resource Constraints? IDPSs can protect the systems
of an organization, but at a price. It makes little sense to incur additional expense for IDPS
features if your organization does not have sufficient systems or personnel to handle the alerts
generated by the system. Here are some of the questions an organization must ask:
●
What is the budget for acquisition and life-cycle support of intrusion detection hard-
ware, software, and infrastructure?—Remember that the acquisition of IDPS software
is not the only element that counts toward the total cost of ownership; you may also
have to acquire a system on which to run the software, obtain specialized assistance
to install and configure the system, and train your personnel. Ongoing operations may
also require additional staff or outside contractors.
●
Is there sufficient existing staff to monitor an intrusion detection system full time?—
Some IDPSs require that systems personnel attend them around the clock. If you do
not anticipate having such personnel available, you may wish to explore those systems
that accommodate less than full-time attendance.
●
Does your organization have authority to instigate changes based on the findings of
an intrusion detection system?—It is critical that you and your organization be clear

about what you plan to do about the problems uncovered by an IDPS. If you are not
empowered to handle the incidents that arise as a result of the monitoring, you should
consider coordinating your selection and configuration of the IDPS with the party
who is empowered.31
IDPS Product Features and Quality
The IDPSs on the market provide a bewildering array of capabilities and features that may or
may not be relevant to the needs of a particular organization. In selecting a specific product or a
set of product features, you should consider the questions discussed in the following sections.32
Is the Product Sufficiently Scalable for Your Environment? Many IDPSs
struggle to function within large or widely distributed enterprise network environments.
Most of this is because of the product’s inability to handle the high volume of network
traffic. The demands of a large environment can take several different forms:
●
The product cannot support the network throughput required to inspect packets and
pass benign packets on to their destinations. This causes latency to overall network
communications.
●
Because of the large number of sensors that large enterprises must deploy to cover
the various logical networks, management of the sensors can be unwieldy. Products
without centralized management and monitoring of the sensors will quickly over-
whelm the IDPS support staff.
●
Large enterprises typically have many offices or many logical networks. Without proper
placement of IDPS sensors, the organization may have a false sense of security, believing
they are seeing all traffic in cases where entire network segments may not be monitored.33
How Has the Product Been Tested? Simply asserting that an IDPS has certain
capabilities is not sufficient to demonstrate that those capabilities are real. You should
request demonstrations of how suitable a particular IDPS is to your environment and goals.
You should also get answers to these questions:
●
Has the product been tested against functional requirements?—What assumptions has
the vendor made regarding the goals and constraints of customer environments?
●
Has the product been tested against attack?—Ask vendors for details of the security
testing that its products have been subjected to. If the product includes network-based
vulnerability assessment features, ask whether test routines that produce system
crashes or other denials of service have been identified and flagged in system
documentation and interfaces.34
What Is the User Level of Expertise Targeted by the Product? Different
IDPS vendors target users with different levels of technical and security expertise. Ask
vendors what their assumptions are regarding the users of their products. Any organization
planning on deploying IDPS should budget knowledgeable, trained support staff who can
maintain the infrastructure and ensure that the IDPS operates according to plan.35
Is the Product Designed to Evolve as the Organization Grows? The
product you choose should be able to adapt to your needs over time. To ensure that
happens, you should ask vendors the following questions:

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

●
Can the product adapt to growth in user expertise?—Can the IDPS’s interface be
configured (with shortcut keys, customizable alarm features, and custom signatures)
on the fly? Are these features documented and supported?
●
Can the product adapt to growth and change of the organization’s systems
infrastructure?—This question has to do with the ability of the IDPS to scale to
an expanding and increasingly diverse network. Most vendors have experience in
adapting their products as target networks grow. Ask about commitments to support
new protocol standards and platform types.
●
Can the product adapt to growth and change of the security threat environment?—
This is especially critical given the current Internet threat environment, in which 30 to
40 new attacks are published to the Web every month.36
What Are the Support Provisions for the Product? Like other systems, IDPSs
require maintenance and support over time. These needs should be identified and prepared
in a written report. Questions to ask include:
●
What are the commitments for product installation and configuration support?—
Many vendors provide expert assistance to customers in installing and configuring
IDPSs; others expect that your own staff will handle these functions and, therefore,
provide only telephone or e-mail help-desk functions.
●
What are the commitments for ongoing product support?—In this area, ask about the
vendor’s commitment to supporting your use of its IDPS product.
●
Are subscriptions to signature updates included?—Most IDPSs are signature based, so
the value of the product is only as good as the signature database against which
events are analyzed. Most vendors provide subscriptions to signature updates for
some period of time (a year is typical).
●
How often are subscriptions updated?—In today’s threat environment, this is a critical
question.
●
How quickly after a new attack is made public will the vendor ship a new signature?—
If you are using IDPSs to protect highly visible or heavily traveled Internet sites, it is
especially critical that you receive the signatures for new attacks as soon as possible.
●
Are software updates included?—Most IDPSs are software products and, therefore,
subject to bugs and revisions. Ask the vendor about support for software updates and bug
patches and determine to what extent they are included in the product you purchase.
●
How quickly will software updates and patches be issued after a problem is reported
to the vendor?—Because software bugs can allow attackers to nullify an IDPS’s
protective effect, it is extremely important that problems be fixed reliably and quickly.
●
Are technical support services included? What is the cost?—Technical support services
means vendor assistance in tuning or adapting your IDPS to accommodate special
needs, whether that’s monitoring a custom or legacy system within your enterprise or
reporting IDPS results in a custom protocol or format.
●
What are the provisions for contacting technical support (e-mail, telephone, online
chat, Web-based reporting)?—The contact provisions will likely tell you whether these
technical support services are accessible enough to support incident handling or other
time-sensitive needs.

●
Are there any guarantees associated with the IDPS?—As with other software pro-
ducts, IDPSs traditionally have few guarantees associated with them; however, in an
attempt to gain market share, some vendors are initiating guarantee programs.
●
What training resources does the vendor provide?—Once an IDPS is selected,
installed, and configured, it must still be operated by your personnel. In order for
these people to make optimal use of the IDPS, they should be trained in its use. Some
vendors provide this training as part of the product package.
●
What additional training resources are available from the vendor and at what cost?—
If the IDPS vendor does not provide training as part of its IDPS package, you should
budget appropriately to train your operational personnel.37
Strengths and Limitations of IDPSs
Although IDPSs are a valuable addition to an organization’s security infrastructure, there are
things they do well and things they do not do well. As you plan the security strategy for your
organization’s systems, it is important to understand what IDPSs should be trusted to do and
what goals might be better served by other types of security mechanisms.
Strengths of IDPSs IDPSs perform the following functions well:
●
Monitoring and analysis of system events and user behaviors
●
Testing the security states of system configurations
●
Baselining the security state of a system, then tracking any changes to that baseline
●
Recognizing patterns of system events that correspond to known attacks
●
Recognizing patterns of activity that statistically vary from normal activity
●
Managing operating system audit and logging mechanisms and the data they generate
●
Alerting appropriate staff by appropriate means when attacks are detected
●
Measuring enforcement of security policies encoded in the analysis engine
●
Providing default information security policies
●
Allowing non-security experts to perform important security monitoring functions38
Limitations of IDPSs IDPSs cannot perform the following functions:
●
Compensating for weak or missing security mechanisms in the protection infrastructure,
such as firewalls, identification and authentication systems, link encryption systems, access
control mechanisms, and virus detection and eradication software
●
Instantaneously detecting, reporting, and responding to an attack when there is a
heavy network or processing load
●
Detecting newly published attacks or variants of existing attacks
●
Effectively responding to attacks launched by sophisticated attackers
●
Automatically investigating attacks without human intervention
●
Resisting all attacks that are intended to defeat or circumvent them
●
Compensating for problems with the fidelity of information sources
●
Dealing effectively with switched networks

There is also the considerable challenge of configuring an IDPS to respond accurately to a
perceived threat. Once a device is empowered to react to an intrusion by filtering or even
severing a communication session, or by severing a communication circuit, the impact from a
false positive becomes increasingly significant. It’s one thing to fill an administrator’s e-mail
box or compile a large log file with suspected attacks; it’s quite another to shut down critical
communications. Some forms of attacks are designed to trip the organization’s IDPS,
essentially causing the organization to conduct its own DoS attack by overreacting to an
actual, but insignificant, attack.39
Deployment and Implementation of an IDPS
Deploying and implementing an IDPS is not always a straightforward task. The strategy
should consider a number of factors, the foremost being how the IDPS will be managed and
where it will be placed. These factors determine the number of administrators needed to
install, configure, and monitor the IDPS, as well as the number of management workstations,
the size of the storage needed for retention of the data generated by the systems, and the
ability of the organization to detect and respond to remote threats.
IDPS Control Strategies An IDPS can be implemented via one of three basic control
strategies. A control strategy determines how an organization exerts influence and maintains
the configuration of an IDPS. It also determines how the input and output of the IDPS is to
be managed. The three commonly utilized control strategies are centralized, partially distrib-
uted, and fully distributed. The IT industry has been exploring technologies and practices to
enable the distribution of computer processing cycles and data storage for many years.
These explorations have long considered the advantages and disadvantages of the central-
ized strategy versus strategies with varying degrees of distribution. In the early days of
computing, all systems were fully centralized, resulting in a control strategy that provided
high levels of security and control as well as efficiencies in resource allocation and manage-
ment. During the 1980s and 1990s, with the rapid growth in networking and computing
capabilities, the trend was to implement a fully distributed strategy. In the mid-1990s,
however, the high costs of a fully distributed architecture became apparent, and the
IT industry shifted toward a mixed strategy of partially distributed control. A strategy of
partial distribution, in which some features and components are distributed and others are
centrally controlled, is now recognized as the recommended practice for IT systems in gen-
eral and for IDPS control systems in particular.
Centralized Control Strategy In a centralized IDPS control strategy, all IDPS control
functions are implemented and managed in a central location, which is depicted by the large
square symbol labeled “IDPS Console” in Figure 6-13. The IDPS console includes the manage-
ment software, which collects information from the remote sensors (depicted in the figure by
triangular symbols), analyzes the systems or networks monitored, and determines whether the
current situation has deviated from the preconfigured baseline. All reporting features are also
implemented and managed from this central location. The primary advantages of this strategy
are related to cost and control. With one central implementation, there is one management
system, one place to go to monitor the status of the systems or networks, one location for
reports, and one set of administrative management. This centralization of IDPS management
supports task specialization because all managers are either located near the IDPS management

the remote sensors. This means that each person can focus specifically on the assigned task. In
addition, the central control group can evaluate the systems and networks as a whole, and
because it can compare pieces of information from all sensors, the group is better positioned to
recognize a large-scale attack.

the physical location of each IDPS component. Each monitoring site uses its own paired
sensors to perform its own control functions to achieve the necessary detection, reaction,
and response functions. Thus, each sensor/agent is best configured to deal with its own envi-
ronment. Because the IDPSs do not have to wait for a response from a centralized control
facility, their reaction time to individual attacks is greatly increased.
Partially Distributed Control Strategy A partially distributed IDPS control
strategy, shown in Figure 6-15, combines the best of the other two strategies. Although the
individual agents can still analyze and respond to local threats, they report to a hierarchical

central facility, which enables the organization to detect widespread attacks. This blended
approach to reporting is one of the more effective methods of detecting intelligent attackers,
especially those who probe an organization through multiple points of entry, trying to scope
out the systems’ configurations and weaknesses, before they launch a concerted attack. The
partially distributed control strategy also allows the organization to optimize for economy of
scale in the implementation of key management software and personnel, especially in the
reporting areas. When the organization can create a pool of security managers to evaluate
reports from multiple distributed IDPS systems, it becomes better able to detect these
distributed attacks before they become unmanageable.

IDPS Deployment Given the highly technical skills required to implement and configure
IDPSs and the imperfection of the technology, great care must be made in the decisions about
where to locate the components, both in their physical connection to the network and host
devices and in how they are logically connected to each other and the IDPS administration
team. Because IDPSs are designed to detect, report, and even react to anomalous stimuli,
placing IDPSs in an area where such traffic is common can result in excessive reporting.
Moreover, the administrators monitoring systems located in such areas can become desensi-
tized to the information flow and may fail to detect actual attacks in progress.
As an organization selects an IDPS and prepares for implementation, planners must select a
deployment strategy that is based on a careful analysis of the organization’s information
security requirements and that integrates with the organization’s existing IT infrastructure but,
at the same time, causes minimal impact. After all, the purpose of the IDPS is to detect anoma-
lous situations, not create them. One consideration is the skill level of the personnel required to
install, configure, and maintain the systems. An IDPS is a complex system in that it involves
numerous remote monitoring agents (on both individual systems and networks) that require
proper configuration to gain the proper authentication and authorization. As the IDPS is
deployed, each component should be installed, configured, fine-tuned, tested, and monitored. A
mistake in any step of the deployment process may produce a range of problems, from a minor
inconvenience to a network-wide disaster. Thus, both the individuals installing the IDPS and the
individuals using and managing the system require proper training.
NIDPS and HIDPS can be used in tandem to cover both the individual systems that connect to
an organization’s networks and the networks themselves. To do this, it is important for an
organization to use a phased implementation strategy so as not to affect the entire organiza-
tion all at once. A phased implementation strategy also allows security technicians to resolve
the problems that do arise without compromising the very information security the IDPS is
installed to protect. In terms of sequencing the implementation, first the organization should
implement the network-based IDPS, as this type of IDPS is less problematic and easier to
configure than their host-based counterparts. After the NIDPSs are configured and running
without issue, the HIDPSs can be installed to protect the critical systems on the host server.
Next, after both are considered operational, it would be advantageous to scan the network
with a vulnerability scanner such as Nmap or Nessus to determine if (1) the scanners pick up
anything new or unusual and (2) the IDPS can detect the scans.
Deploying Network-Based IDPSs As discussed earlier, the placement of the sensor
agents is critical to the operation of all IDPSs, but this is especially critical in the case of
NIDPSs. As shown in Figure 6-16, NIST recommends four locations for NIDPS sensors:
Location 1: Behind each external firewall, in the network DMZ
Advantages:
●
The IDPS sees attacks that originate on the Internet and may penetrate the network’s
perimeter defenses.
●
The IDPS can identify problems with the network firewall policy or performance.
●
The IDPS sees attacks that might target the Web server or ftp server, both of which
commonly reside in this DMZ.
●
Even if the incoming attack is not detected, the IDPS can sometimes recognize, in the
outgoing traffic, patterns that suggest that the server has been compromised.

Location 2: Outside an external firewall
Advantages:
●
The IDPS documents the number of attacks originating on the Internet that target the
network.
●
The IDPS documents the types of attacks originating on the Internet that target the
network.
Location 3: On major network backbones
Advantages:
●
The IDPS monitors a large amount of a network’s traffic, thus increasing its chances
of spotting attacks.
●
The IDPS detects unauthorized activity by authorized users within the organization’s
security perimeter.
Location 4: On critical subnets
Advantages:
●
The IDPS detects attacks targeting critical systems and resources.
●
The location allows organizations with limited resources to focus these resources on
the network assets considered of greatest value.40

Deploying Host-Based IDPSs Implementing HIDPSs can be a painstaking and time-
consuming task, as each HIDPS must be custom configured to its host systems. Deployment
begins with implementing the most critical systems first. This poses a dilemma for the deploy-
ment team because the first systems to be implemented are mission critical, and any problems
in the installation could be catastrophic to the organization. Therefore, it may be beneficial to
practice an implementation on one or more test servers configured on a network segment
that resembles the mission-critical systems. Practicing will help the installation team gain
experience and also help determine if the installation might trigger any unusual events.
Gaining an edge on the learning curve by training on nonproduction systems will benefit the
overall deployment process by reducing the risk of unforeseen complications.
Installation continues until either all systems are installed or the organization reaches the
planned degree of coverage it is willing to live with in regard to the number of systems or
percentage of network traffic. To provide ease of management, control, and reporting, each
HIDPS should, as discussed earlier, be configured to interact with a central management
console.
Just as technicians can install the HIDPS in offline systems to develop expertise and identify
potential problems, users and managers can gain expertise and understanding of the
operation of the HIDPS by using a test facility. This test facility could use the offline systems
configured by the technicians, but it could also be connected to the organization’s backbone
to allow the HIDPS to process actual network traffic. This setup also enables technicians to
create a baseline of normal traffic for the organization. During the system testing process,
training scenarios can be developed that enable users to recognize and respond to common
attack situations. To ensure effective and efficient operation, the management team can estab-
lish policy for the operation and monitoring of the HIDPS.
Measuring the Effectiveness of IDPSs When selecting an IDPS, one typically
looks at four measures of comparative effectiveness:
●
Thresholds—A threshold is a value that sets the limit between normal and abnormal
behavior. Thresholds usually specify a maximum acceptable level, such as x failed
connection attempts in 60 seconds or x characters for a filename length. Thresholds
are most often used for anomaly-based detection and stateful protocol analysis.
●
Blacklists and whitelists—A blacklist is a list of discrete entities, such as hosts, TCP or
UDP port numbers, ICMP types and codes, applications, usernames, URLs, filenames,
or file extensions, that have been previously determined to be associated with
malicious activity. Also known as hot lists, blacklists are typically used to allow IDPSs
to recognize and block activity that is highly likely to be malicious; they may also be
used to assign a higher priority to alerts that match entries on the blacklists. Some
IDPSs generate dynamic blacklists that are used to temporarily block recently detected
threats (e.g., activity from an attacker’s IP address). A whitelist is a list of discrete
entities that are known to be benign. Whitelists are typically used on a granular basis,
such as protocol by protocol, to reduce or ignore false positives involving known
benign activity from trusted hosts. Blacklists and whitelists are most commonly used
in signature-based detection and stateful protocol analysis.
●
Alert settings—Most IDPS technologies allow administrators to customize each alert
type. Examples of actions that can be performed on an alert type include (1) toggling

it on or off, (2) setting a default priority or severity level, (3) specifying what
information should be recorded and what notification methods (e.g., e-mail, pager)
should be used, and (4) specifying which prevention capabilities should be used. Some
products also suppress alerts if an attacker generates many alerts in a short period of
time; they may also temporarily ignore all future traffic from the attacker. This is to
prevent the IDPS from being overwhelmed by alerts.
●
Code viewing and editing—Some IDPS technologies permit administrators to see some
or all of the detection-related code. This is usually limited to signatures, but some
technologies allow administrators to see additional code, such as programs used to
perform stateful protocol analysis.41
Once implemented, IDPSs are evaluated using two sets of measurements. First, administrators
evaluate the number of attacks detected in a known collection of probes. Second, they
examine the level of use (commonly measured in megabits per second of network traffic) at
which the IDPSs fail. An IDPS evaluation might read something like this: “At 100 Mbps, the
IDPS was able to detect 97 percent of directed attacks.” This is a dramatic change from the
previous method used for assessing IDPS effectiveness, which was based on the total number
of signatures the system was currently running—a sort of “more is better” approach. This
evaluation method of assessment was flawed for several reasons. Not all IDPSs use simple
signature-based detection. Some systems, as discussed earlier, can use the almost infinite
combination of network performance characteristics of statistical-anomaly-based detection to
detect a potential attack. Also, some more sophisticated signature-based systems actually use
fewer signatures/rules than older, simpler versions, which, in direct contrast to the signature-
based assessment method, suggests that less may actually be more.
The recognition that the size of the signature base is an insufficient measure of an IDPS’s
effectiveness led to the development of stress test measurements for evaluating IDPS
performance. These only work, however, if the administrator has a collection of known
negative and positive actions that can be proven to elicit a desired response. Because
developing this collection can be tedious, most IDPS vendors provide testing mechanisms
for verifying that their systems are performing as expected. These testing processes enable
the administrator to:
●
Record and retransmit packets from a real virus or worm scan
●
Record and retransmit packets from a real virus or worm scan with incomplete TCP/
IP session connections (missing SYN packets)
●
Conduct a real virus or worm scan against an invulnerable system
This last measure is important because future IDPSs will probably include much more detailed
information about the overall site configuration. With the rapid growth in technology, each
new generation of IDPSs will require new testing methodologies. However, the measured
values that will continue to be of interest to IDPS administrators and managers will, most
certainly, include some assessment of how much traffic the IDPS can handle, the numbers of
false positives and false negatives it generates, and the IDPS’s ability to detect actual attacks.
Vendors of IDPS systems could also include a report of the alarms sent and the relative
accuracy of the system in correctly matching the alarm level to the true seriousness of the
threat. Some planned metrics for IDPSs may include the flexibility of signatures and detection
policy customization.

IDPS administrators may soon be able to purchase tools that test IDPS effectiveness. Until
these tools are available from a neutral third party, the diagnostics from the IDPS vendors
will always be suspect. No vendor, no matter how reliable, would provide a test that their
system would fail.
One note of caution: There may be a strong tendency among IDPS administrators to use com-
mon vulnerability assessment tools, like Nmap or Nessus, to evaluate the capabilities of an
IDPS. Although this may seem like a good idea, it will not work as expected, because most
IDPS systems are equipped to recognize the differences between a locally implemented
vulnerability assessment tool and a true attack.
In order to perform a true assessment of the effectiveness of IDPS systems, the test process
should be as realistic as possible in its simulation of an actual event. This means coupling real-
istic traffic loads with realistic levels of attacks. You cannot expect an IDPS to respond to a
few packet probes as if they represent a denial-of-service attack. In one reported example, a
program was used to create a synthetic load of network traffic made up of many TCP
sessions, with each session consisting of a SYN (or synchronization) packet, a data exchange,
and ACK (or acknowledgement) packets, but no FIN or connection termination packets. Of
the several IDPS systems tested, one of them crashed because of lack of resources while it
waited for the sessions to be closed. Another IDPS passed the test with flying colors because
it did not perform state tracking on the connections. Neither of the tested IDPS systems
worked as expected, but the one that didn’t perform state tracking was able to stay opera-
tional and was, therefore, given a better score on the test.42
Honeypots and Honeynets
A class of powerful security tools that go beyond routine intrusion detection is known
variously as honeypots, honeynets, or padded cell systems. To understand the value, you
must first understand how they differ from a traditional IDPS. Honeypots are decoy systems
designed to lure potential attackers away from critical systems. In the industry, they are also
known as decoys, lures, and fly-traps. When a collection of honeypots connects several honey-
pot systems on a subnet, it may be called a honeynet. A honeypot system (or in the case of a
honeynet, an entire subnetwork) contains pseudo-services that emulate well-known services
but are configured in ways that make them look vulnerable to attacks. This combination is
meant to lure potential attackers into committing an attack, thereby revealing themselves—
the idea being that once organizations have detected these attackers, they can better defend
their networks against future attacks against real assets. In sum, honeypots are designed to:
●
Divert an attacker from critical systems
●
Collect information about the attacker’s activity
●
Encourage the attacker to stay on the system long enough for administrators to
document the event and perhaps respond
Because the information in a honeypot appears to be valuable, any unauthorized access to it
constitutes suspicious activity. Honeypots are equipped with sensitive monitors and event
loggers that detect attempts to access the system and collect information about the potential
attacker’s activities.

IDPS researchers have used honeypot systems since the late-1980s, but until recently no
commercial versions of these products were available. It is important to seek guidance from
legal counsel before deciding to use either of these systems in your operational environment,
because using an attractant and then launching a back hack or counterstrike might be illegal
and make the organization subject to a lawsuit or a criminal complaint.
The advantages of using the honeypot approach are:
●
Attackers can be diverted to targets that they cannot damage.
●
Administrators have time to decide how to respond to an attacker.
●
Attackers’ actions can be easily and more extensively monitored, and the records can
be used to refine threat models and improve system protections.
●
Honeypots may be effective at catching insiders who are snooping around a network.
The disadvantages of using a honeypot approach are:
●
The legal implications of using such devices are not well defined.
●
An expert attacker, once diverted into a decoy system, may become angry and launch
a more hostile attack against an organization’s systems.
●
Administrators and security managers need a high level of expertise to use these
systems.
●
Administrators should also be wary of the wasp trap syndrome. In this syndrome,
a concerned homeowner installs a wasp trap in his backyard to trap the few insects he
sees flying about. Because these traps use scented bait, however, they wind up
attracting far more wasps than were originally present. Security administrators should
keep the wasp trap syndrome in mind before implementing honeypots.
●
Special care must be taken in order to ensure that a honeypot cannot be compromised
in a way that could lead to further attacks on your networks or systems.43
Trap-and-Trace Systems
Trap-and-trace applications, which are an extension of the attractant technologies discussed
in the previous section, are growing in popularity. These systems use a combination of
techniques to detect an intrusion and trace it back to its source. The trap usually consists of
a honeypot and an alarm. While the intruders are distracted, or trapped, by what they per-
ceive to be successful intrusions, the system notifies the administrator of their presence. The
trace feature is an extension to the honeypot. The trace—similar to caller ID—is a process
by which the organization attempts to determine the identity of someone discovered in
unauthorized areas of the network or systems. If the intruder is someone inside the organiza-
tion, the administrators are completely within their power to track the individual and turn
him or her over to internal or external authorities. If the intruder is outside the security
perimeter of the organization, then numerous legal issues arise.
On the surface, trap-and-trace systems seem like an ideal solution. Security is no longer
limited to defense. Now, the security administrators can go on the offense. They can track
down the perpetrators and turn them over to the appropriate authorities. Under the guise of
justice, some less scrupulous administrators may even be tempted to back hack, or hack into
a hacker’s system to find out as much as possible about the hacker. Vigilante justice would
be a more appropriate term for these activities, which are in fact deemed unethical by most

codes of professional conduct. In tracking the hacker, administrators may end up wandering
through other organizations’ systems, especially when the wily hacker has used IP spoofing,
compromised systems, or a myriad of other techniques to throw trackers off the trail. The
back-hacking administrator becomes the hacker.
There are more legal drawbacks to trap and trace. The trap portion frequently involves the
use of honeypots or honeynets. When using honeypots and honeynets, administrators should
be careful not to cross the line between enticement and entrapment. Enticement is the process
of attracting attention to a system by placing tantalizing information in key locations.
Entrapment is the act of luring an individual into committing a crime to get a conviction.
Enticement is legal and ethical, whereas entrapment is not. It is difficult to gauge the effect
such a system can have on the average user, especially if the individual has been nudged into
looking at the information.
Active Intrusion Prevention
Some organizations would like to do more than simply wait for the next attack; they want to
implement active countermeasures to stop attacks. One tool that provides active intrusion
prevention is known as LaBrea (http://labrea.sourceforge.net/labrea-info.html). LaBrea works by
taking up the unused IP address space within a network. When LaBrea notes an ARP request, it
checks to see if the IP address requested is actually valid on the network. If the address is not
currently being used by a real computer or network device, LaBrea pretends to be a computer
at that IP address and allows the attacker to complete the TCP/IP connection request, known as
the three-way handshake. Once the handshake is complete, LaBrea changes the TCP sliding win-
dow size to a low number to hold open the TCP connection from the attacker for many hours,
days, or even months. Holding the connection open but inactive greatly slows down network-
based worms and other attacks. It allows the LaBrea system time to notify the system and
network administrators about the anomalous behavior on the network.
Chapter Summary
■
An intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) works like a burglar alarm by
detecting network traffic that is a violation of the rules with which it is configured
and activating an alarm. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are designed to detect
possible intrusion activity and sound an alarm. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs)
work like IDSs but also take action to defend the network they are designed to
protect.
■
A network-based IDPS (NIDPS) monitors network traffic and, when a predefined
event occurs, responds and notifies the appropriate administrator. A host-based IDPS
(HIDPS) is a system that resides on a particular computer or server and monitors the
system’s activity.
■
Signature-based IDPSs, also known as knowledge-based IDPSs, examine data traffic
for patterns that match signatures, which are preconfigured, predetermined attack
patterns. Statistical anomaly-based IDPSs, also known as behavior-based IDPSs,
collect data from normal traffic and establish a baseline. When an activity is found to
be outside the baseline parameters (or clipping level), these IDPSs activate an alarm
to notify the administrator.

Selecting IDPS products that best fit an organization’s specific needs is a challenging
and complex process because there is a wide array of products and vendors available,
each with its own approach and capabilities.
■
Deploying and implementing IDPS technology is a complex undertaking that will
require the sponsoring organization to have some experience with the technology or
else hire the necessary expertise to complete the process successfully. After such a
deployment, each organization should measure the effectiveness of its IDPS and then
continue to periodically assess its effectiveness after the initial deployment.

Honeypots are decoy systems, which means they are designed to lure potential
attackers away from critical systems. In the security industry, these systems are also
known as decoys, lures, or fly-traps.
■
Trap-and-trace applications are designed to react to intrusion events by tracing them
back to their sources. This process is fraught with professional and ethical issues in
that some observers may perceive the back hack in the trace process as being as inap-
propriate as the initial attack.

Hands-On Projects
Project 6-1
In this project, you will set up and configure Valhala, a Windows-based honeypot.
Then, you will examine how network scanning applications like Nmap detect and
report services enabled in Valhala using different types of scanning options.
To complete this exercise, you need to have an installation of Windows 7 Professional
available for use. This can either be achieved by installing Windows 7 Professional on an
available computer or by building a virtual instance using virtualization software such as
Oracle’s VirtualBox or VMWare’s VMware player. Additionally, you will need the Nmap
application available for use on a separate system, which we will use to “attack” the hon-
eypot system.

tion purposes. Click the Network icon in the system tray and select Open Network and
Sharing Center.
4. Select Windows Firewall.
5. Select Turn Windows Firewall on or off.
6. Select Turn off Windows Firewall (not recommended) for both the Private and Public
network settings, then click OK.
7. Close the Control Panel.
8. Now, we will run a quick Nmap scan to verify which services are available on the
Windows 7 system before we configure and start the honeypot. On the system with
Nmap installed, type this Nmap command: Nmap –sS <IP address of Windows 7
system>, then press Enter.
9. There should be few, if any, services available. Make a note of the services available for
comparison later on.
10. Start Valhala by double-clicking the honeypot icon on the desktop. If prompted,
uncheck the Always ask before opening this file option, then click Run to allow the soft-
ware to run. You should now see the Valhala main menu, as displayed in Figure 6-17.
Now, we will enable a telnet honeypot server, which will provide a fake server for
attackers to access.
11. Click Server Config, then click Options under TELNET Server.
12. Click the white box to the left of Enable Telnet Service to enable the service; the box
should turn blue.
13. Click the white box to the left of No login required to allow anonymous logins; the
box should turn blue. When done, your screen should look like what is shown in
Figure 6-18.

14. Close the setup screen by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the window, which
will return you to the Server Config menu. Now, you will enable the FTP honeypot
server, which will provide another fake server for attackers to access.
15. Click Options under FTP Server.
16. Click the white box to the left of Enable FTP Service to enable the service; the box
should turn blue.
17. Close the setup screen by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the window, which
will return you to the Server Config menu. Note that both TELNET Server and FTP
Server have changed from red to green, as shown in Figure 6-19.
18. Close the Server Config menu by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the
window, which will return you to the Main menu.
19. To enable the honeypot, click Monitoring in the vertical menu. The application will
minimize to the system tray.
20. Execute the Nmap command listed in Step 9 again. This time, you will see a new Telnet
service available on port 23 as well as an FTP service available on port 21, as shown in
Figure 6-20.
This type of scan may be enough to fool most attackers into believing a telnet or FTP server
is available. However, attackers may run a more in-depth Nmap scan and collect more data
about the target. In cases like this, a honeypot may return data that indicates a service is not

actually what is being advertised. To see what additional data can be returned, run a
different Nmap scan by typing the following command: nmap –sV <IP address of
Windows 7 system>, then press Enter.
Your results should look similar to what is shown in Figure 6-21. Note that the results
returned now include a “VERSION” column, which returns suspicious data for the Telnet
server. Instead of returning an expected telnet service banner, Nmap displays suspicious ver-
sion details that may indicate a Telnet server isn’t actually running on that port, and the
“SERVICE” column now displays “backdoor” instead of “telnet.” Results like this could
possibly alert an attacker to the possibility that this is a honeypot, thus minimizing its effec-
tiveness as a decoy.
Valhala also displays alerts as a result of intrusive scans like the ones we just ran. These
alerts are also saved in text files in the location we specified earlier in this exercise. The
visual alert is displayed in Figure 6-22.

Introduction
“Wireless,” in its simplest form, means without wire (or cable). We usually construe this
to mean that the signal is transmitted without physical media and is instead sent using
some form of radiated signal—radio, light, or some other part of the electromagnetic spec-
trum. The application of this technology will be implemented differently, depending on
whether you are working with wireless computer networks, wireless telephony, or one of
a number of other wireless connectivity solutions. For the purposes of this chapter, we will
be examining wireless computer networking and the security needs for this particular applica-
tion of technology.
The EBS folks were hitting their stride with all the PCI remediation activities. They
had defined the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), so they knew all the networks
and systems where credit card information was transferred, processed, or stored.
They had also addressed a number of security concerns involving encryption on their
extranet with Davis Office Megaplex, audited their firewall rules and architecture,
and ensured that proper intrusion detection was implemented—or at least being
planned—in the IT environment. They were feeling confident about meeting their
deadlines ahead of schedule.
A prep team had come in to help conduct an informal audit of the PCI standards
to identify any remaining gaps. Over the course of a week, the EBS IT team had
worked with the audit prep team reviewing system configurations, walking through
processes, and showing proof of their security efforts.
At the outbriefing, the prep team went through their findings. The biggest shock
to EBS? Its CDE used a wireless connection that allowed financial analysts to connect
to the cardholder systems to conduct business. The EBS IT staff had overlooked the
fact that the network architecture allowed wireless access.
For EBS to pass the PCI audit, it would have to prove that it met the standards put
forth in the PCI DSS Wireless Guideline. In other words, the EBS team had more work
to do. According to the Wireless Guideline: “In the case where an organization has
decided to deploy a WLAN [Wireless LAN] for any purpose whatsoever, and connect
the WLAN to the CDE, then that WLAN is now a part of the CDE and is therefore in
scope within the PCI DSS and within the scope of this document.”1 It would need to
investigate the EBS wireless network and ensure that all of the PCI security measures
EBS deployed for the LAN also covered the wireless network—or disallow the connec-
tion altogether. The end goal seemed further away.

What makes wireless network security so difficult compared to wire-based networking? In
wire-based networking, network administrators can control the infrastructure—the physical
media (wires and cables) and the access points (hubs and switches). In wireless networking,
once the radio signal leaves the access points (known as wireless access points or WAPs), an
organization has little control over the signal. The WAP is the radio transmitter/receiver that
takes the signal from the wired network and broadcasts it to wireless receivers, and vice
versa. Although it is possible to restrict the footprint of the wireless network (the area the
radio signal reaches) by controlling the strength of the broadcast signal, without the use of
some very specialized technologies an organization can do little to guide or restrict the wireless
signal itself. Instead, the organization must protect the data carried on the signal and the way
the signal connects to other networks. The former is accomplished through encryption, which
was covered in Chapter 3. The latter is accomplished through access controls, which were
covered in Chapter 5. We will revisit each of these as we examine the form, function, and
controls associated with wireless network security.
When installing networks in existing buildings, it may prove difficult and expensive to
retrofit the facility with physical cable (as described in Chapter 2). A widely used alter-
native is a wireless LAN. A wireless local area network, also known as WLAN or by the
branding label Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), is a group of interconnected networking nodes
operating within a limited geographic area that offers network access by the use of
broadcast rather than physical media. Because the vast majority of WLANs use radio-
based communications, that will be the focus of the discussion here. WLANs are thought
by many in the IT industry to be inherently insecure. The communication channel between
the wireless network interface of any computing device and the access point that provides
its services uses radio transmissions, which are subject to accidental or purposeful interfer-
ence or interception.
Wireless networks are inherently different from networks that use physical media like wires or
cables. The IEEE has documented the differences, noting that wireless networks:
●
Use a method of signaling that does not have readily observable boundaries,
requiring special equipment to discern where the signal is present or where it is not
●
Are susceptible to signals that come from other devices that are not part of the
network as planned or built but that share the wireless medium being used
●
Operate using a medium that is less reliable than a wired medium
●
Often use dynamic topologies in which the number or even the nature of the devices
being networked changes often and with little or no notice
●
May lack full connectivity among nodes and invalidate the assumptions made about
networking station visibility
●
Operate in environments in which signal propagation is less certain and in which
signal timing and symmetry may be unverifiable
●
Are subject to interference from other networks when the signal area overlaps, even
when the other networks are conforming to standards2
This chapter examines the differences between wireless networks and networks that use physical
media, focusing on technologies and standards, topologies and architectures, and security
mechanisms.

Wireless Technologies and Standards
WLANs became popular in the 1990s, with the emergence of commercial products that con-
nected computers wirelessly using radio transmissions in the 900-megahertz band, which
yielded data transmission rates of approximately 1 megabit per second (Mbps). Before that,
radio-based teletypewriters and specialized communications terminals had been used by the
military and news networks, but they were seldom used in corporate networks. Before long,
though, data rates improved dramatically, and the bandwidths assigned to radio-based
computer communications began to vary more widely—into the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) range,
yielding data rates of up to 54 Mbps.3
WLANs often combine a number of standards and technologies. The basic building blocks of
the modern WLAN are wireless modulation technologies and IEEE Standard 802.11. We will
cover these topics in the following sections.
Wireless Modulation Technologies
WLANs place the data onto the wireless radio signal using a host of modulation techniques.
As described in Chapter 2, modulation is the method of manipulating the medium signal to
carry the source data. Two sets of technology are involved in wireless communications modula-
tion. The first set involves the placement of the data bits onto the electrical signal using Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and/or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) as described here:
●
QAM—This is a modulation technique that combines digital and analog signaling
to encode data into radio signals. It functions by encoding two message channels at the
same time. This is done by modulating (or changing) the amplitudes of two carrier waves,
using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or the amplitude
modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. In the case of digital QAM, at least two
phases and at least two amplitudes are used. A simple version of the modulation method,
using four data values (4-QAM), is illustrated in Figure 7-1. In practice, the number of
values encoded can reach 256 bits, transmitting an 8-bit code for each signal measurement.4

QPSK—This is a modulation technique that provides multi-bit carrying capability for
the encoding of digital data on an analog signal. It is an enhancement of Binary Phase
Shift Keying (BPSK), which uses two signal states that are 180 degrees out of phase
to carry two signal values (0 and 1). QPSK uses four signal states that are 90 degrees
out of phase to carry four signal values. PSK modulators (such as QPSK) are often
implemented with QAM principles, but they are not considered QAM because the
amplitude of the carrier is not modulated.5
The second set of technologies involved in wireless communications modulation, collectively
known as spread-spectrum transmission, addresses the transmission of the data stream that
has been properly encoded onto the radio signal. Spread-spectrum approaches have a number
of advantages over the transmission of data using fixed frequencies:
●
Narrowband interference is reduced by the use of spread-spectrum signals. The processes
used to send and receive data literally spread out the signal across multiple frequencies
and thus reduce the interference.
●
Interceptions of signals are less likely. To a narrowband receiver, the spread-spectrum
signals appear to be background noise. A potential eavesdropper is only able to intercept
a transmission if the pseudorandom noise codes are known and the timing is synchronized
with the sender.6
●
Interference is minimized between spread-spectrum and narrowband transmissions
because multiple devices can safely operate in one band of frequencies. The spread-
spectrum signals add minimal noise to the narrow-frequency communications, and
vice versa. As a result, bandwidth can be utilized more efficiently.7
Three technologies provide spread-spectrum security and transport features for the data stream:
●
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)—This is a method of transmitting radio
signals by jumping (hopping) rapidly among a number of predefined frequencies.
This hopping follows a pattern known as a pseudorandom sequence, which must be
programmed into the sending and receiving stations.
●
Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)—This works by taking the original data
stream and breaking it up into small bits, then transmitting each of those on a different
frequency channel simultaneously. It also combines the data signal with another data
sequence, known as a chipping code, much like the XOR technique that was described
in Chapter 5. The chipping code helps the signal resist interference and also enables
the original data to be recovered if data bits are damaged during transmission.8
●
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)—Frequency-division multiplexing
(FDM) schemes were described in Chapter 2. This one is used to carry multiple digital
signals. OFDM splits the data stream across several parallel channels. It may use QAM
or QPSK to encode the data on each channel.9
IEEE 802.11 Standards
The IEEE ratified the 802.11 standard for WLANs in 1997. The original standard encompassed
transmission of data using three defined methods, one of which was radio transmission in the
2.4 GHz band. In 1999, the standard was ratified with two amendments: 802.11a and
802.11b. These more clearly defined the use of radio transmission methods. The 802.11a
standard operated in the 5 GHz range and offered speeds up to 54 Mbps. The 802.11b standard

operated in the 2.4 GHz range and offered data rates up to 11 Mbps. Although the 802.11a
standard offered greater speeds, it operated efficiently at shorter distances compared to
802.11b.10 This factor helped to push 802.11b as the dominant standard in the marketplace.
IEEE 802.11b was intended to provide performance, throughput, and security features compa-
rable to wired LANs.
In 2003, the 802.11g amendment was released. It specified a radio transmission method that
supported data rates of up to 54 Mbps. It is noteworthy that IEEE 802.11g-compliant products
are backward compatible with IEEE 802.11b-compliant products.
In 2009, yet another amendment to the 802.11 standard was released. Known as 802.11n, the
standard introduced: techniques for security improvements, multiple antennae to receive infor-
mation simultaneously, the ability to operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ranges, and the abil-
ity to transfer data at up to 600 Mbps.11 Table 7-1 compares the basic characteristics of IEEE
802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. Wireless networking that follows 802.11 is also
known as Wi-Fi.
The IEEE has defined standards for communications between most modern computer and elec-
tronic system operations in a document called IEEE Standard for Information Technology –
Telecommunications and Information Exchange Between Systems - Local and Metropolitan
Area Networks - Specific Requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control
(MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications.12 The areas covered include:
●
The basic functionality offered by 802.11-compliant devices operating in a peer-to-peer
fashion or part of a wired network. As part of this functionality, the standard outlines
the abstraction needed to ensure communications are seamless among the various
wireless communication systems.
●
Operations where an 802.11 device operates with multiple overlapping wireless LANs.
●
The confidentiality of data transmitted over a WLAN, as well as mechanisms for
802.11 devices to authenticate themselves.
●
Techniques that operate at the physical and data link layers to ensure efficient and
reliable wireless data transfers.
●
Mechanisms to “satisfy regulatory requirements for operation in the 5 GHz band.”13

In general, the estimated range of 802.11b and 802.11g networks is up to 150 feet indoors
and up to 450 feet outdoors, with 802.11a having approximately one-third that range. Most
specifications in the 802.11 range provide a bandwidth of 20-40 MHz. Under the 802.11y
standard amendment, the FCC allows licensees to implement equipment with much higher
power by using the standards in Table 7-1, increasing ranges up to 3 miles and operating in
the 3650–3700 MHz band.
Wi-Fi Alliance Certifications
In 1999, as the 802.11 technology was coming to market, a group called the Wi-Fi Alliance was
created to certify the interoperability of 802.11b products.14 This group felt a need to reduce
the ambiguity found in the marketplace when standards are emerging and manufacturers are
creating products while trying to innovate and gain market share. Although they waited for
802.11 standards to mature, they wanted to assure consumers that some interoperability was
available. In 2002, the Wi-Fi Alliance created the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) security proto-
col, which implements a large portion of the 802.11i standard, which was then in the draft
stage. Perhaps the largest difference between WPA and the 802.11i was that WPA called for
supporting the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which would have required more com-
puting power than many devices could muster at that time.15 Later, with the ratification of the
IEEE 802.11i amendment, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA2. This is a branding term for
interoperable equipment that is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11i requirements. The Wi-Fi
Alliance began testing IEEE 802.11i products for WPA2 certification shortly after the IEEE
802.11i amendment was finalized.16
Other Wireless Standards
Although 802.11 and Wi-Fi are the dominant wireless networking standards, there are others.
Most prevalent among them are Bluetooth, WiMedia, ZigBee, and WiMax.
Bluetooth Bluetooth is an open standard for short-range wireless communications between
computers and small computing devices, including cell phones, earpieces, and computer acces-
sories. It has been included in IEEE standard 802.15.1. It was established by scientists at the
Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson and soon included Intel, Nokia, IBM, and
Toshiba. Soon thereafter, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies (a 1996 AT&T spin-off that included
Bell Labs), and 3Com joined the industry group. Bluetooth and its security concerns are covered
in more detail later in this chapter.
WiMAX WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), IEEE 802.16e is a
Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) standard for devices in facilities that are
geographically dispersed. WiMAX works in the 10–66 GHz transmission band, with a
range of up to 30 miles, and provides a data rate of up to 75 Mbps.17 A projected update
to the standard, IEEE 802.16m (known as WiMAX 2), is expected to increase this data
rate to approximately 1 Gbps. WiMAX adoption is promoted through the WiMAX forum
(www.wimaxforum.org), which currently reports deployment of over 592 WiMAX net-
works in 149 countries.

WiMAX Security Concerns In SP800-127, NIST states:
WiMAX wireless interface threats focus on compromising the radio links between
WiMAX nodes. These radio links support both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-
line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation. Links from LOS WiMAX systems are
generally harder to attack than those from NLOS systems because an adversary
would have to physically locate equipment between the transmitting nodes to
compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the wireless link. WiMAX NLOS
systems provide wireless coverage over large geographic regions, which expands
the potential staging areas for both clients and adversaries. Like other networking
technologies, all WiMAX systems must address threats arising from denial of
service attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification,
and resource misappropriation.18
To help improve an organization’s security posture relative to WiMAX, NIST recommends
the following:
●
Develop a robust WMAN security policy and enforce it.
●
Assess WiMAX technical countermeasures before implementing a vendor’s WiMAX
technology.
●
Require mutual authentication for WiMAX devices.
●
Implement Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)-validated encryption
algorithms employing FIPS-validated cryptographic modules to protect data
communications.19
WiMedia WiMedia is outlined in the IEEE standard 802.15.3 and was the first standard
for ultra-wideband radio technology. WiMedia provides a Wireless Personal Area Network
(WPAN) standard for a low-cost, low-power-consumption network. One of the first practi-
cal applications of WiMedia was the use of Wireless USB (WUSB) to allow USB accessories
to communicate remotely with their host system. WiMedia is assigned a wide range of frequen-
cies in the GHz range in order to avoid interference with other wireless devices. Data rates
of around 480 Mbps can be achieved over short distances.20
WiMedia Security Concerns Because of the novelty of this technology and its limited
deployment so far, there are no published concerns about WiMedia. As with all new technol-
ogies, however, there is the inherent concern that issues and exploits will be discovered as it
is deployed.
ZigBee ZigBee is outlined in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low-rate ultra-wideband wire-
less communications. ZigBee is another WPAN standard used for monitoring and control
devices, such as building lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) climate
control systems, as well as short-range sensors like shipping container tracking devices.21
ZigBee Security Concerns The largest areas of concern with regard to security in ZigBee
lie in accidental key reuse, which could lead to breaking of the encryption mechanism and loss
of access control list data because of power loss. Because many of the ZigBee devices are
expected to be battery powered, loss of power could potentially result in corrupted or lost
ACL table data.22

Wireless Architectures and Topologies
Technology standards and hardware and software that follow them are not enough to create
functional networks. One also needs to have clearly defined ways of assembling the pieces into
functional networks that deliver business functionality. Wireless architectures define ways to
use interoperating devices to create structured solutions without the need to prepare each
deployment from scratch. This architecture can make the adoption of these technologies much
more useful and cost-effective.
Wireless Architectures
The basic building block of the wireless network is a set of clients using wireless connectivity
interfaces or wireless network interface cards (WNIC) to connect to a WAP. The WAP pro-
vides the connection between various wireless clients as well as between the clients and
other networks. These other networks may be other wireless networks, but most commonly
the WAP provides a connection to wired LANs and through those LANs to the Internet.
This basic model of wireless clients within a defined network area is referred to as the basic
service set (BSS). Individual stations, or STAs (IEEE terminology for a client with wireless
connectivity capabilities), are authorized as members of a particular BSS. Once they leave
the range of the BSS, as shown in Figure 7-2, they lose connectivity and can no longer func-
tion on the network. This BSS range is also known as a basic service area (BSA).23
The simplest form of BSS is an independent BSS (IBSS), which consists of a set of stations
that are members of one BSA only. If a station moves within the range of a different BSA, it
is unable to join without previous authorization. According to the 802.11 standard:
An STA’s membership in a BSS is dynamic (STAs turn on, turn off, come within
range, and go out of range). To become a member of a BSS, an STA joins the BSS
using the synchronization procedure. To access all the services of an infrastructure

BSS, an STA shall become ‘associated.’ These associations are dynamic and involve
the use of the distribution system service (DSS).24
Each BSS is uniquely identified with a BSSID. In the infrastructure BSS, the MAC address of
the WAP is used. In an IBSS, the BSSID is a randomly generated 46-bit number. A BSSID of
all 1s is used as a broadcast address for all nodes on the BSS.
To connect multiple BSSs, a distributed system (DS) may provide wireless internetworking con-
nectivity. A DS works as a backbone network that WAPs use to connect other networks, but the
DS contains no independent stations of its own, as shown in Figure 7-3. The DS provides a distrib-
uted system service (DSS) that enables the access points to provide cross domain (BSS) connectiv-
ity for clients. In order to accomplish this task, the WAP works as a switch or bridge to connect
multiple networks—thus, it is multi-homed (contains more than one integral network interface
card). Note that the DS backbone could be wireless or wired, as the environment mandates.
A collection of BSSs connected by one or more DSs is referred to as an extended service set
(ESS), as illustrated in Figure 7-4. Essentially, an ESS creates a large “virtual” network con-
sisting of all BSS logical segments connected by the various DSs. Clients don’t realize the
size or scope of the network, only that connectivity occurs. All data flows through the net-
work from the client stations to the various access points, across one or more distributed sys-
tem backbones, eventually arriving at the designated receiver station.
Wireless Topologies
Many of the physical and logical topologies discussed in Chapter 2 can be applied to wireless
networks. If you remember, networks are configured—physically or logically—in one of these
basic layouts:
●
Star—A central node connected directly to all the other nodes
●
Bus—A linear connection from node to node to node
●
Ring—A circular bus in which the last station is connected to the first

Hierarchical—A set of connected stars, with higher-level nodes connecting multiple
stars by communicating directly with the central nodes
●
Mesh—A multipoint-to-multipoint connection in which each node is connected to
multiple other nodes
●
Hybrid—Some combination of the above
Of these, only the star, mesh, hierarchical, and hybrid layouts are generally applied to wireless
networks.
Star Wireless Topology Most BSS networks are configured as simple stars. In the
“center” of the star topology, as shown in Figure 7-5, is the WAP, providing connectivity
to the various stations directly. This topology is also known as a hub-and-spoke model, as
it bears a resemblance to a wagon wheel. In this topology, the stations are unable to com-
municate directly to peers, instead having to route all traffic through the center WAP. This
can become an issue if, for some reason, the client station is unable to communicate directly
to the WAP and, thus, falls off the network.
Mesh Wireless Topology In the mesh wireless topology, there may be no dominant
WAP. Instead, all stations on the network are equal peers and, thus, are capable of commu-
nicating through each other. As shown in Figure 7-6, mesh wireless topologies lack clearly
defined boundaries. The lack of boundaries may result in challenges in which the network
has difficulty determining which stations should relay a message from the sending station.
If multiple stations are able to communicate with a sending node, some mechanism (described
later in this chapter) is needed to ensure that multiple copies of the same transmission are not

routed through the network, creating additional problems. The primary advantage of this con-
figuration is the flexibility of the network. If a station goes down, the rest of the network
compensates for its loss. This model is also capable of “stringing out” over longer distances,
as the station-to-station-to-station links become very linear—almost buslike—in their physical

configuration. This allows the network to operate over larger areas than the centralized star
counterpart.
Hierarchical Wireless Topologies One method of combining multiple star topolo-
gies is to create a hierarchy of stars in which individual stations connect to a WAP, which
in turn connects to a higher-level WAP. These higher-level WAPs connect multiple WAPs
and provide much larger geographic coverage. Unless the network provides centralized
authentication, however, the individual stations are usually unable to move between lower-
level WAPs (BSSs) and, thus, are constrained by the same geographic connectivity issues as
the star topology. Figure 7-7 illustrates a simple hierarchical wireless topology. The primary
advantage of this model is the increased number of connections among stations, which
allows greater connectivity.
Hybrid Wireless Topologies As shown in Figure 7-8, the hybrid wireless topology
combines the star and mesh topologies. Stations primarily communicate to WAPs, as in the
star topology. However, if a station is unable to directly connect to a WAP but can commu-
nicate with another station, it creates a temporary mesh. The intermediate station serves as a
secondary WAP, resulting in fault tolerance, like with the mesh topology. If the station is
able to reconnect to its WAP, the mesh connection is discarded. This model provides much
greater mobility for individual stations, as they are able to move between WAPs. This
approach will require some form of centralized authentication to provide both the mesh
and mobile star connectivity models.25

Wireless Architectures
The implementation of these topologies brings up the basic wireless connection architectures
that are incorporated into the topologies. In general, wireless networks can be categorized
according to one of two descriptors:
●
Implementation (ad hoc and infrastructure)
●
Connectivity (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint)
Implementation Models Wireless networks can be implemented in one of two
approaches, although hybrids of the two also exist. In the first approach, the ad hoc approach,
networks are established as users on local stations need them. In the second approach, the
organization establishes permanent, persistent connection points, typically providing cen-
tralized authentication to control access.
Ad Hoc Implementation Ad hoc wireless models rely on the existence of multiple
stations to provide connectivity. In ad hoc mode, there are no formal access points, only

peer stations. In order for higher-level connectivity to occur, however, at least one station has
to have connectivity to an infrastructure WAP. This peer-to-peer (P2P) connection, in which
the WLAN consists almost exclusively of wireless communications between multiple peer
stations, creates a hybrid role for each station—part access point, part client. This ad hoc
networking is convenient for connection between computers and peripherals, between multiple
computers for file and resource sharing, and to create temporary networks for a particular
purpose—like computer gaming.
The primary drawback associated with these networks is that they are inherently unreliable. If a
single station is disconnected from the network, many individual stations may be without
connectivity. Given that the ad hoc networks are typically not formally supported by an
organization, they tend to be reliant on a diverse set of underlying computing technologies,
which creates additional issues with security (discussed later in this chapter) and reliability.
Figure 7-9 shows Windows 7 ad hoc network configuration screens. As a caution, Figure 7-9
shows an open access ad hoc network (no password). It is strongly recommended that wireless
networks never be implemented without at least some level of access control protection.
Infrastructure Model Most installed wireless networks use the infrastructure model, in
which a WAP is installed and connected to wired networks to provide connectivity. This is usu-
ally done to create a wireless network footprint in a defined area for ongoing communications.

This model meets users’ expectations for reliable connectivity for the stations connecting
within the established perimeter of the WLAN. Infrastructure model-based networks tend
to be much more scalable than ad hoc networks, and they are usually better organized,
supported, and managed. In fact, for most Wi-Fi users, ad hoc networks are relegated to
those who want to put up a temporary capability, often away from their central facility.
Connectivity Models Another component of the discussion around wireless net-
works is how they communicate. Closely related to the models discussed in the previous
section, these architectures reflect whether the wireless communications channels are
unicast (only sent to one station) or broadcast (sent to multiple stations simulta-
neously). Between unicast and broadcast is multicast, in which a message is sent to mul-
tiple recipients (but not all) in the same transmission. The most commonly defined
approaches to these architectures are point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and mesh
(multipoint).
Point-to-Point As the name implies, a point-to-point wireless network is a direct link
between two stations, implemented typically in the ad hoc manner. One station is configured
to allow connection (reception), and another station initiates the connection. Point-to-point
networks provide a dedicated circuit between the two stations and can offer higher data
transfer rates than other shared options. Point-to-point networks can be extended to point-
to-point-to-point networks, which allows longer-range communications. This is similar to a
radio relay model used for long-distance communications, in which intermediate stations pro-
vide connectivity for very remote stations.
Point-to-Multipoint A point-to-multipoint wireless network is most commonly found in
the star and hierarchical topologies discussed earlier. In this model, a single access point pro-
vides connectivity for a number of clients within a BSS. In telephony, the modern wireless
phone (formerly cellular phone) network is a point-to-multipoint wireless network.
Mesh Multipoint The next iteration of point-to-multipoint communication is the mesh
topology. This is when any station can directly send and receive data to and from any other
station. Also known as a multipoint-to-multipoint network, the mesh multipoint network,
including the hybrid network topology, is a more recent approach to networking, allowing
end users to decide what wireless networks they need. Many new devices are capable of
establishing this type of topology.
Roaming Though not a true connectivity model, the roaming model is the logical
extension of the previously discussed models and implementations. It not only provides
point-to-multipoint connectivity, but it allows the station to move between adjacent
BSSs without losing connectivity. Although this technology was pioneered decades ago
with wireless telephony, only recently has it been available to true wireless networking.
Many organizations have been implementing roaming between multiple access points
in relatively small LANs, but its availability for larger geographic areas is still being
rolled out.
WiMAX, discussed earlier, is the latest roaming implementation for wide-scale wireless
networking. Once end-users purchase WiMAX, they are able to move throughout the
WMAN (within the WiMAX coverage area) while maintaining connectivity.

Mobile Hotspots and Wireless Networking Mobile hotspots and mobile device relays
are an increasingly popular choice for users of personal digital assistants, smartphones, and
other portable wireless devices. A mobile hotspot is a service usually provided by a wireless
telephony service provider to allow users to connect their wireless devices to a specific com-
mercial wireless service. It typically consists of a wireless network card or similar device that
the customer can use to access wireless services over the provider’s network.
Another innovation related to the mobile hotspot is the use of wireless devices to serve as a
wireless network access point relay. Smartphones can serve as personal mobile hotspots to
allow users to connect their laptops or tablet computers to a service provider’s network by
relaying the network traffic between the computer and the network. Though efficient and
convenient for the user, unless proper access controls are implemented in the relay device,
the technique can result in exploitation of the mobile device used for the relay and exploita-
tion of all computers connected to the device.
Wireless Security Protocols
Without some form of protection, the radio transmission signals used in WLANs can be inter-
cepted by anyone with a receiver and a wireless packet sniffer. In order to prevent interception
of these communications, these networks must use some form of cryptographic security con-
trol. Two sets of protocols are currently widely used to help secure wireless transmissions:
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Both are designed for
use with the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
WEP was an early attempt to provide security with the 802.11 network protocol. It is now
considered too weak cryptographically to provide any meaningful protection from eavesdrop-
ping, but for a time it did provide some measure of security for low-sensitivity networks.
Using a 64-bit key, WEP uses the RC4 cipher stream to encrypt each packet. This key is cre-
ated using a 24-bit initialization vector and a 40-bit key value. The packets are formed using
an XOR function with the RC4 key value stream to encrypt the data packet. A 4-byte integ-
rity check value (ICV) is calculated for each packet and then appended. Acording to many
experts, WEP is too weak for use in most network settings for these reasons:
●
Key management is not effective because most networks use a single shared secret key
value for each node. Synchronizing key changes is a tedious process, and no key
management is defined in the protocol, so keys are seldom changed.
●
The initialization vector (IV) is too small, resulting in the recycling of IVs. An attacker
can reverse-engineer the RC4 cipher stream and decrypt subsequent packets or forge
future packets. In 2007, this was accomplished in less than one minute.
●
There are a number of tools available that allow automatic cracking of the WEP key
because of these WEP weaknesses—Aircrack-ng, WEPCrack, and Cafe Latte, to name
a few. Most tools collect network packets broadcast over the air to nearby wireless
networks (or wireless clients). In turn, the cracking tools sift through the captured
packets to reverse-engineer the WEP key.

In summary, an intruder who collects enough data can threaten a WEP network in just a few
minutes by decrypting or altering the data being transmitted, or by forging the WEP key to
gain unauthorized access to the network. WEP also lacks a means of validating user creden-
tials to ensure that only those who should be on the network are allowed to access it.26
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2)
The Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA to resolve the issues with WEP. WPA has a key size of
128 bits, and instead of static, seldom-changed keys, it uses dynamic keys created and shared
by an authentication server. WPA accomplishes this through the use of the Temporal Key
Integrity Protocol (TKIP), a suite of algorithms that attempts to deliver the best security given
the constraints of a wireless network environment. The algorithms are designed to work with
legacy networking devices. TKIP adds four new algorithms to those that were used in WEP:
●
A cryptographic message integrity code (MIC), called Michael, to defeat forgeries
●
A new IV sequencing discipline to remove replay attacks from the attacker’s arsenal
●
A per-packet key-mixing function to de-correlate the public IVs from weak keys
●
A rekeying mechanism to provide fresh encryption and integrity keys, thereby undo-
ing the threat of attacks stemming from key reuse
Although it offered dramatically improved security over WEP, WPA was not the most secure
wireless protocol design. Some compromises were made in the security design to allow compat-
ibility with existing wireless network components. Protocols to replace TKIP are currently
under development. Table 7-2 provides a summary of the differences between WEP and WPA.
TKIP TKIP is a “wrapper” used to enhance the WEP protocol. It was proposed as a way
to implement improved security on slower platforms without performance degradation.
The most fundamental improvement changes the key used in each packet by combining
an encryption key, the MAC address of the transmitting station, and a serial number for
the packet.27

TKIP offers these fundamental security features for IEEE 802.11 WLANs:
●
Confidentiality with the RC4 algorithm
●
Integrity using the Michael message digest algorithm (through generation of a MIC)
●
Replay prevention through a frame sequencing technique
●
Use of a new encryption key for each frame
●
Implementation of countermeasures when encountering a frame with a MIC error,
which is a strong indicator of an active attack
TKIP also provides encapsulation, which enhances the WEP encapsulation technique without
requiring hardware changes. It uses three distinct keys: two integrity keys and an encryption
key. Validation checks are performed on the frames as they are unencapsulated. For example,
if a violation of proper frame sequencing is detected, the frame is discarded. Also, for each
frame, the MIC is recomputed and compared with the MIC transmitted in the packet; if
these do not match, the frame is discarded and TKIP countermeasures are invoked.28
WPA2
In 2004, WPA2 was made available as a replacement for WPA. Beginning in 2006, WPA2
became mandatory for all new Wi-Fi devices. WPA2 is backwardly compatible with WPA,
although some older network cards have difficulty using it. Although WPA met a subset of
requirements from the 802.11i standard, WPA2 was designed to meet all requirements.
One of the important security concepts introduced with 802.11i was the idea of Robust
Security Networks (RSN). An RSN is a network that only allows connections that are
Robust Security Network Associations (RSNAs)—in other words, wireless connections that
provide encryption to protect against WLAN security threats.29
The most notable of the features added to WPA2 were AES-based encryption, CCMP
encryption protocol, and EAP authentication protocol, which are described in the
following sections.
The RSN protocol functions as follows:
1.
The wireless NIC sends a probe request.
2.
The WAP sends a probe response with an RSN Information Exchange (IE) frame.
3.
The wireless NIC requests authentication via one of the approved methods.
4.
The WAP provides authentication for the wireless NIC.
5.
The wireless NIC sends an association request with an RSN Information Exchange
(IE) frame.
6.
The WAP sends an association response.30
CCMP Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC)
Protocol (CCMP) is an encryption protocol that enhances the confidentiality and integrity
of wireless LAN protocols implemented with the 802.11i amendment to the 802.11 standard.
CCMP can be implemented as a negotiated cipher suite when creating a Robust Security
Network Association (RSNA).

CCMP was created to meet the security requirements for secure wireless connections without
the constraint of interoperation with legacy hardware, and it is considered the long-term
solution to the confidentiality requirement in RSNs. The use of CCMP is required to achieve
RSN compliance.
CCMP draws from the authenticated cipher mode of the AES standard: Counter Mode with
CBC-MAC (CCM). CCM is a mode of operation defined for any block cipher with a 128-bit
block size. CCMP protects the integrity of both the packet data and portions of the IEEE 802.11
header. CCM combines two well-known and proven cryptographic techniques to achieve robust
security: CTR for confidentiality and Cipher Block Chaining MAC (CBC-MAC) for both authen-
tication and integrity protection. For IEEE 802.11, CCM employs a single 128-bit session key
(TK) to protect the duplex data channel. The CCMP key space has size 2128 and uses a 48-bit
packet number (PN) to construct a nonce to prevent replay attacks. In cryptographic terms, a
nonce is an arbitrary number used only once in communications. The construction of the nonce
allows the key to be used for both integrity and confidentiality without compromising either.
CCM uses a new Temporal Key every session—with every new STA-AP association. Unlike
TKIP, the use of AES at the core of CCM obviates the need to have per-packet keys. As a
result, the two-phase key-mixing functions of TKIP encapsulation are not present in the
CCMP encapsulation. Figure 7-10 depicts the CCMP encapsulation, illustrating the vari-
ous functions and their sequence in the encapsulation process.31

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) NIST Standard 800-97 provides the
following overview of EAP:
IEEE 802.11 RSN uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for the
authentication phase of establishing an RSNA. EAP supports a wide variety of
authentication methods, also called EAP methods. They include authentication
based on passwords, certificates, smart cards, and tokens. EAP methods also can
include combinations of authentication techniques, such as a certificate followed by a
password, or the option of using either a smart card or a token. This flexibility allows
EAP to integrate with nearly any environment to which a WLAN might connect.32
It is important to understand that EAP is a framework for device-to-device authentication but
not an actual authentication mechanism. Do not confuse authentication between devices,
which is used to ensure trust between network nodes, with the authentication required from
users connecting to systems or networks. Originally, EAP was developed as a way to expand
authentication mechanisms for Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) dial-up communications beyond
the standard Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge-Handshake Authentica-
tion Protocol (CHAP). EAP’s use, however, has expanded to other communications methods,
such as WLANs. Because it’s a framework, EAP supports many different authentication
mechanisms, such as:
●
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)—A proprietary EAP authenti-
cation mechanism developed by Cisco
●
EAP-TLS—Uses TLS protocol and an authentication server like RADIUS
●
EAP-PSK—Uses a preshared key (PSK) to establish a mutual authentication method
Other authentication mechanisms are continually being added. It is important to understand
the specific authentication mechanism and whether it employs strong cryptographic methods
to provide strong authentication mechanisms.
Robust Security Network (RSN) In addition to the stations and access points dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter, the Robust Security Network (RSN) concept includes a new
component: authentication servers (ASs). AS systems include RADIUS and KERBEROS ser-
vers, discussed in earlier chapters. By including an AS, a traditional WLAN can be upgraded
to an RSN. NIST Special Publication 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security
Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i, provides significant detail on this subject and thus
has served as the foundation for much of the material in this chapter. The most common
protocol used in support of an RSNA is EAP. The security of legacy 802.11 implementations
is addressed in NIST SP 800-48.
RSN Operations According to NIST SP800-97, IEEE 802.11 RSN operation may be
thought of as occurring in five distinct phases:
1.
RSN Operation Phase 1: Discovery. The STA identifies an AP for a WLAN
with which it wishes to communicate. The STA locates an AP either by
receiving one of the AP’s periodic transmissions of Beacon frames, or by
sending a Probe Request to solicit a Probe Response from an AP. After the
STA has identified an AP, the STA and the AP exchange frames to negotiate
various parameters for their communications. By the end of the phase, the
STA and AP have agreed on an authentication method.

2.
RSN Operation Phase 2: Authentication. During this phase, the STA and AS
prove their identities to each other. The authentication frames pass through the
AP, which also blocks non-authentication traffic from the STA using IEEE
802.1X port-based access control. The actual authentication mechanism is
implemented by the STA and AS using EAP. EAP provides a framework that
allows the use of multiple methods for achieving authentication, including static
passwords, dynamic passwords, and public key cryptography certificates. After
authentication has been completed, the AAA key is installed in the STA and AS.
It serves as a root key to enable the generation of other keys used to secure com-
munications between the STA and AP.
3.
RSN Operation Phase 3: Key Generation and Distribution (KGD). During the
KGD phase, the AP and the STA perform several operations that cause crypto-
graphic keys to be generated and placed on the AP and the STA. The KGD
phase employs two handshakes: a 4-Way Handshake and a Group Key Hand-
shake. During the 4-Way Handshake, the STA and AP establish a security pol-
icy that specifies several key security capabilities, such as data confidentiality
and integrity protocols for protecting data traffic, and a key distribution
approach. Both handshakes employ message encryption and integrity checking,
using one of two confidentiality and integrity algorithms. For both types of
handshakes, NIST requires the use of AES Key Wrap with HMAC-SHA-1-128
instead of RC4 encryption with HMAC-MD5 because AES and SHA-1 are
FIPS-approved algorithms, and RC4 and MD5 are not. Selecting CCMP as
the cipher suite will ensure the use of the appropriate key wrap algorithms.
4.
RSN Operation Phase 4: Protected Data Transfer. The STA and AP share
data securely, using the security policy and cryptographic keys established
during the first three phases. Because secure data transfer occurs between
the STA and the AP only, organizations need to consider carefully the secu-
rity of the data during the rest of its transit (e.g., on the DS).
5.
RSN Operation Phase 5: Connection Termination. During this phase, the
STA and AP tear down their secure connection and delete their association,
thereby terminating their wireless connection.33
WLAN Security Concerns
In deploying a wireless network, it’s important to understand the various threats to the net-
work in order to better defend against them. Here are some of the most notable threats to
running a secure WLAN:
●
Rogue APs—There are two categories of threats that arise when an unauthorized access
point is erected in a nearby physical location. The first is generally referred to as a
rogue access point. This occurs when an employee sets up a WAP connected to the
wired LAN. The problem is that the WAP is not tracked by the organization and may
not be properly secured, resulting in a weak point on the network. The second threat
category is generally referred to as an evil twin. This refers to the man-in-the-middle
attack, in which an attacker sets up an access point to lure unsuspecting victims, who

think the WAP is part of the legitimate WLAN, into connecting. The attacker, using
software like Airsnarf, tricks the users into providing legitimate user names and passwords
or other information—an example of social engineering.
●
Key cracking—There are a number of tools available—Aircrack, AirSnort, and
WEPCrack, for example—that allow an attacker to sniff a large number of wireless
network packets and then use the data to crack the encryption key. These types of
attacks are fairly easy to pull off when wireless networks use WEP; they’re even
possible with WPA. Using strong passkeys and WPA2 are currently the best
protection against these types of attacks.
●
Wardriving—Because of the very nature of wireless communications, it is possible for
an attacker to locate himself within the radio boundaries of the WLAN. By doing so,
he can carry out key cracking on encrypted WLAN or just simply join unencrypted
WLANs. The attacker can then roam the network like a trusted employee. There are
also a number of antennae that can be used to increase how far away an attacker can
be and still communicate with the WLAN. The term wardriving refers to the practice
of driving around looking for and mapping insecure WLANs.
●
ARP poisoning—As with the ARP poisoning attacks on wired networks, WLANs
typically cannot verify that an ARP reply sent by a host on the wireless network
was in response to a valid ARP request from another host. Because of this lack of
verification, an attacker can send an ARP reply stating that its MAC address owns a
particular IP address. If the attacker can poison the cache of two systems, mapping
the IP address of System A on System B to the attacker system and mapping the
IP address of System B on System A to the attacker system, the attacker can initiate a
man-in-the-middle attack, effectively routing communication between the two hosts.
Tools like Ettercap make ARP poisoning fairly easy to accomplish.
●
DoS attacks—Like wired networks, WLANs are susceptible to DoS attacks that
overwhelm the WAP with 802.1x handshake attempts, 802.1x authentication
attempts, or even legitimate traffic. However, WAPs are also susceptible to radio
jamming attacks, in which the attacker sends a more powerful signal to nearby
clients and disallows radio communication with the legitimate WAP.
WLAN Security Solutions
WLAN technology has had a number of problems with protocols like WEP and WPA, which
has creasted the perception that WLANs are inherently insecure. However, after a number of
improvements, it is now possible to have sufficient security layers to protect wireless commu-
nication. Here are a number of recommendations to help secure your wireless network:
●
Mandate the use of WPA2 and strong passkeys to encrypt wireless communications
and to provide a basic layer of authentication.
●
Employ wireless IDS to help spot rogue access points, evil twins, wardriving, and
other probes of the network.
●
Use mutual authentication methods—like EAP-TLS—in order to provide a level of
trust by authenticating not only the client to server but also the server to the client.
●
For an added security layer, ensure that wireless connections authenticate via a VPN
prior to gaining access to the wired network resources.

WLAN Security Myths
There are a number of recommendations that have been passed from organization to orga-
nization with regards to securing wireless networks. Unfortunately, many of these recom-
mendations don’t provide an adequate level of security or are a waste of time.34 Here are
some of the most popular myths:
●
MAC filtering—Most WAPs allow administrators to limit the connections to only
listed MAC addresses. The idea is that only trusted computers can connect to the
WAP, whereas untrusted (unlisted) MAC addresses cannot. The problem is that
anyone sniffing wireless communications can intercept the MAC addresses of trusted
systems. From there, the attacker only has to spoof the trusted MAC address to gain
access to the network.
●
SSID hiding—The usual advice is to have the administrator disable the WAP’s SSID
beaconing ability. The thinking is that, then, attackers are unable to discover the
wireless network and, therefore, won’t attack it. Unfortunately, tools like Kismet or
NetStumbler make it incredibly easy to scan the local area in order to find wireless
networks, regardless of whether or not they actively advertise their SSIDs via
beaconing.
●
Disable DHCP—Many organizations believe that by disabling DHCP for wireless
network participants, they can prevent an attacker from obtaining a legitimate
IP address and, therefore, prevent the attacker from participating on the network.
Unfortunately, as just mentioned, wireless sniffing allows an attacker to easily
determine what IP addresses are valid. From there, it’s a simple matter to assign an
IP address to participate.
●
LEAP authentication—Cisco created the Lightweight Extensible Authentication
Protocol (LEAP) for its wireless devices in order to provide an additional security
layer to networks using WEP. Unfortunately, a researcher named Joshua Wright
released a tool called Asleap, which is easily able to crack LEAP passwords. Since
then, Cisco has released updates to LEAP, but there have also been a number of new
tools able to attack LEAP. At this point, LEAP does not provide stronger security
than WPA2 and is likely ineffective in providing a proper security layer.
●
Signal suppression—Many organizations believe that by placing WAPs away from
the physical boundaries of the building or campus or by reducing the signal strength,
attackers will not be able to connect to the wireless network. Unfortunately, there are
a number of antennae on the market that allow attackers to increase signal strength
for both transmission and better reception. These antennae will quickly overcome
most attempts to reposition WAPs or reduce signal strength.
Bluetooth
Like 802.11 standards, Bluetooth defines a wireless communication standard that allows
mobile phones, computers, cars, and other industrial equipment to communicate with various
accessories. Bluetooth has a physical limitation based on the type of radio used in the device.
Class 3 radios provide a communication range of about 3 feet. Class 2 radios, found in most
mobile devices, have a range of 33 feet. Finally, Class 1 radios, found in industrial applications,

have a range of 300 feet. According to the Bluetooth Core Specification, Bluetooth operates in
the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio frequency band of 2.4 GHz.35 Originally,
Bluetooth had a maximum data rate of around 720 Kbps. The improved Bluetooth 2.0
increased the data rate to around 3 Mbps.
Bluetooth networks are referred to as piconets. When multiple piconets are connected through
common devices, the entire network structure is referred to as a scatternet. In discoverable
mode—which allows other Bluetooth systems to detect and connect—devices can easily be
accessed, much the way that a shared folder can be accessed on a networked computer.
Even in nondiscoverable mode, the device is susceptible to access by other devices that
have connected with it in the past. Here are some key benefits of Bluetooth technology:36
●
Removes wired cables—To reduce clutter or some distance, a number of computer
and phone peripherals have moved to remote Bluetooth connections.
●
Share and synchronize data—Bluetooth-enabled devices can operate on piconets in
order to transfer files from PC to PC, share data between connected phones, or
synchronize phone books from PC to phone.
●
Serve as an Internet hotspot—A Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected to the
Internet and share that connectivity via Bluetooth to other Bluetooth-connected devices.
Bluetooth Security Concerns
Bluetooth has been consistently criticized as an insecure wireless communications standard,
but it is still widely used for wireless telephony, mobile device accessories, and point-
to-point data exchange. By default, Bluetooth does not authenticate connections; however, it
does implement some degree of security when devices access certain services, such as dial-up
accounts and local-area file transfers. Paired devices—usually a computer or phone and a
peripheral that a user plans to connect to it—require that the same passkey be entered on both
devices. This key is used to generate a session key, which is used for all future communications.
There are a number of attacks that exploit the simple security mechanisms implemented in
Bluetooth devices. The Bluetooth attacks, however, must overcome the previously mentioned
physical range in order to carry out attacks (although recent attacks have proved capable of
using directional antennae to increase the range to over a mile).37 Here are some of the most
notable attacks:
●
Bluesnarf—Bluetooth devices employ an object exchange (OBEX) profile that is
intended to allow the easy transfer of business cards, contact information, and other
items. A Bluesnarf attack is one in which the attacker exploits the OBEX connection
to grab e-mail, text messages, contact information, pictures, or other information off
the intended target. Most modern Bluetooth devices require that the two devices be
paired in order for the attack to be successful. Bluesnarfer and Bloover are popular
tools to carry out Bluesnarf attacks.
●
Bluejacking—A Bluejack attack also exploits the OBEX connection, but instead of
stealing data from the target device, the attacker sends a fake vCard for the target. Within
the vCard, the attacker uses the name field to send a message to the unsuspecting victim.
This type of attack has been used in guerilla marketing campaigns or just to see the
reactions of nearby mobile users.

●
BlueBug—The name BlueBug refers to a security vulnerability in Bluetooth-enabled
mobile phones that allows a nearby attacker to issue commands to an unsuspecting
target phone. If the exploit is successful, the attacker can initiate phone calls, read text
messages, and read other information from the phone.38
●
Evil twin—If an attacker uses a device to simulate a Bluetooth access point, he or she
can trick the user into connecting his or her devices to the fake access point. The fake
access point—or evil twin—can capture and store all communications, including the
passkey submission. (This attack can also be classified as a man-in-the-middle attack
and is a very serious concern for WLANs.)
Bluetooth Security Solutions
There are two general principles to keep in mind when securing Bluetooth-enabled devices:
(1) Turn off Bluetooth when you do not intend to use it, and (2) do not accept an incoming
communications pairing request unless you know who the requester is.
Although earlier versions of Bluetooth were inherently insecure, later versions, including
Bluetooth 2.1 +Enhanced Data Rate, provide a new security mechanism called Secure Simple
Pairing (SSP). NIST SP 800-121 describes the four security modes of Bluetooth:
Cumulatively, the various versions of Bluetooth specifications define four security
modes. Each version of Bluetooth supports some, but not all, of the four modes.
Each Bluetooth device must operate in one of the four modes, which are
described below.
Security Mode 1 is non-secure. Security functionality (authentication and encryp-
tion) is bypassed, leaving the device and connections susceptible to attackers. In
effect, Bluetooth devices in this mode are “promiscuous” and do not employ any
mechanisms to prevent other Bluetooth-enabled devices from establishing connec-
tions. Security Mode 1 is only supported in v2.0 + EDR (and earlier) devices.
In Security Mode 2, a service level-enforced security mode, security procedures are
initiated after LMP link establishment but before L2CAP channel establishment.
L2CAP resides in the data link layer and provides connection-oriented and connec-
tionless data services to upper layers. For this security mode, a security manager (as
specified in the Bluetooth architecture) controls access to specific services and
devices. The centralized security manager maintains policies for access control and
interfaces with other protocols and device users. Varying security policies and trust
levels to restrict access may be defined for applications with different security
requirements operating in parallel. It is possible to grant access to some services
without providing access to other services. In this mode, the notion of authoriza-
tion—the process of deciding if a specific device is allowed to have access to a spe-
cific service—is introduced. It is important to note that the authentication and
encryption mechanisms used for Security Mode 2 are implemented at the LMP
layer (below L2CAP), just as with Security Mode 3. All Bluetooth devices can
support Security Mode 2; however, v2.1 + EDR devices can only support it for
backward compatibility with v2.0 + EDR (or earlier) devices.
In Security Mode 3, the link level-enforced security mode, a Bluetooth device initi-

devices operating in Security Mode 3 mandates authentication and encryption
for all connections to and from the device. This mode supports authentication
(unidirectional or mutual) and encryption. The authentication and encryption
features are based on a separate secret link key that is shared by paired devices,
once the pairing has been established. Security Mode 3 is only supported in
v2.0 + EDR (or earlier) devices.
Similar to Security Mode 2, Security Mode 4 (introduced in Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR)
is a service level enforced security mode in which security procedures are initiated
after link setup. Secure Simple Pairing uses Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)
techniques for key exchange and link key generation. Device authentication and
encryption algorithms are identical to the algorithms in Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR and
earlier versions. Security requirements for services protected by Security Mode 4
must be classified as one of the following: authenticated link key required,
unauthenticated link key required, or no security required. Whether or not a link
key is authenticated depends on the Secure Simple Pairing association model used.
Security Mode 4 is mandatory for communication between v2.1 + EDR devices.
There are two methods in which link key generation is performed for Bluetooth.
Security Modes 2 and 3 use one method, while Security Mode 4 uses another.
For Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR (and earlier), operating in Security Mode 2 or 3, two
associated devices simultaneously derive link keys during the initialization phase
when users enter an identical PIN into one or both devices, depending on the
configuration and device type. After initialization is complete, devices automati-
cally and transparently authenticate and initiate the encryption procedure to
secure the wireless link, if encryption is enabled. The PIN code used in Bluetooth
devices can vary between one and 16 bytes. The typical four-digit PIN may be
sufficient for low-risk situations; a longer PIN should be used for devices that
require a higher level of security.
Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) was introduced in Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR for use
with Security Mode 4. SSP simplifies the pairing process by providing a number
of association models that are flexible in terms of device input capability. The
four association models offered in SSP are as follows:
●
Numeric Comparison was designed for the situation where both Bluetooth
devices are capable of displaying a six-digit number and allowing a user to
enter a “yes” or “no” response. During pairing, a user is shown a six-digit
number on each display and provides a “yes” response on each device if the
numbers match.
●
Passkey Entry was designed for the situation where one Bluetooth device has
input capability (e.g., Bluetooth-enabled keyboard), while the other device has
a display but no input capability. In this model, the device with only a display
shows a six-digit number that the user then enters on the device with input
capability.
●
Just Works was designed for the situation where one (or both) of the pairing
devices has neither a display nor a keyboard for entering digits (e.g.,
Bluetooth-enabled headset). It performs Authentication Stage 1 in the same
manner as the Numeric Comparison model, except that a display is not available.

The user is required to accept a connection without verifying the calculated value
on both devices, so MITM protection is not provided.
●
Out of Band (OOB) was designed for devices that support a wireless tech-
nology other than Bluetooth for the purposes of device discovery and crypto-
graphic value exchange. In the case of NFC, the OOB model allows devices
to pair by simply “tapping” one device against the other, followed by the
user accepting the pairing via a single button push.
Security Mode 4 requires Bluetooth services to mandate an authenticated link
key, an unauthenticated link key, or no security at all. Of the association models
described above, all but the Just Works model provide authenticated link keys.39
Chapter Summary
■
Wireless security is problematic. Unlike wire-based networking, which allows network
administrators control over the physical media (wires and cables) and the access
points (hubs and switches), wireless networking allows little control over the signal.
An organization can restrict a wireless network’s footprint, but it can do little to guide
or restrict the wireless signal itself.
■
A wireless local area network, also known as a WLAN or by the branding label Wi-Fi
(wireless fidelity), is a group of interconnected networking nodes operating within a
limited geographic area that offers network access by the use of radio waves.
■
Wireless networks are inherently different from networks that use physical media
like wires or cables.
■
WLANs often combine a number of standards and technologies to provide
communications. The basic building blocks of the modern WLAN are wireless
modulation technologies and the IEEE Standard 802.11.
■
WLANS place the data onto the wireless radio signal by using modulation techniques,
such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Quadrature Phase Shift
Keying (QPSK).
■
Three technologies provide spread-spectrum security and transport features for the
data stream: Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), Direct-Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS), and Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).
■
In 1997, the IEEE ratified the 802.11 standard, which encompassed the transmission
of data using three defined methods, one of which was radio transmission in the 2.4
GHz band. In 1999, the standard was ratified with two amendments: 802.11a and
802.11b.
■
As the 802.11 technology was coming to market and the 802.11i amendment was
being discussed, a group called the Wi-Fi Alliance proposed an interoperability
agreement and a branding arrangement.
■
Although 802.11 and Wi-Fi are the dominant wireless networking standards, there
are others. Most prevalent among the non-802.11-style networking standards are
Bluetooth, WiMedia, Zigbee, and WiMax.

■
A wireless network consists of a set of clients using wireless network interface cards
to connect to a WAP. The WAP provides the connection between various wireless
clients as well as between the clients and other networks. This is considered a basic
service set (BSS). Individual stations or STAs are authorized as members of a
particular BSS. A BSS’s range is known as a Basic Service Area (BSA).
■
A collection of multiple BSSs is referred to as an extended service set (ESS), which
creates a virtual network consisting of all BSS subnets.
■
Wireless networks can be implemented in one of two approaches, although hybrids
of the two certainly exist. In the ad hoc approach, networks are established as users
on local stations need them, and connections are made between end points as needed.
In another approach, the organization establishes permanent, persistent connection
points, typically providing centralized authentication to control access.
■
Another component of wireless networks is how they communicate. Point-to-point
wireless is a direct link between two stations, typically implemented in the ad hoc
manner. Point-to-multipoint wireless is most commonly found in the star and
hierarchical topologies. A more complete instantiation of a multipoint network is
the mesh topology, in which all stations can directly send to and receive from all
other stations.
■
WLANs are thought by many in the IT industry to be inherently insecure. Two sets
of protocols are currently widely used to help secure wireless transmissions: Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).
■
WEP was an early attempt to provide security with the 802.11 network protocol.
■
WPA was introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance to resolve the issues with WEP.
■
Robust Secure Network (RSN) is a wireless security network that provides moderate
to high levels of assurance against WLAN security threats through use of a variety
of cryptographic techniques.
■
The various threats to wireless security include Rogue Aps, Key cracking, ARP
poisoning, and DoS attacks.
■
Recommendations to help secure your wireless network include: mandating the use
of WPA2 and strong passkeys to encrypt wireless communications and to provide a
basic layer of authentication; employing wireless IDS to help spot rogue access points,
evil twins, wardriving, and other probes of the network; and ensuring that wireless
connections authenticate via a VPN prior to gaining access to the wired network’s
resources.
■
Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that allows mobile phones,
computers, cars, and other industrial equipment to communicate with various
accessories. Bluetooth networks are referred to as piconets. Bluetooth has been
consistently criticized as an insecure wireless communications standard, but it is still
widely used for wireless telephony, mobile device accessories, and point-to-point
data exchange. There are two general principles for securing Bluetooth-enabled
devices: (1) Turn off Bluetooth when you do not intend to use it, and (2) do not
accept an incoming communications pairing request unless you know who the
requester is.

Hands-On Projects
Project 7-1
This project examines the increased amount of protection provided to wireless
network traffic when basic encryption is introduced. We will be using several
tools in the “BackTrack” security distribution to capture and inspect wireless
network traffic. This project assumes that you are authorized to work on a wireless net-
work and can attach systems to the network as well as enable and disable encryption.
You will also need two systems and a wireless USB NIC to complete this exercise. One sys-
tem will be used to run BackTrack 5, R1 in a virtual environment such as VMWare or Vir-
tualBox. Setting up BackTrack in a virtual environment is outside the scope of this exercise,
but there are numerous tutorials available on the Internet. (This system will need an open
USB port for use.) The second system needs to be capable of attaching to the wireless net-
work and doing simple Web browsing. Finally, you need an Atheros-based USB Wi-Fi card
capable of passing the aireplay injection test. A list of such devices is available from the
BackTrack Web site at www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Drivers.
First, we will disable any encryption on the wireless network, so that all traffic is being sent
cleartext. Next, we will configure BackTrack to capture that traffic. We will then use the second
system to generate simple HTTP traffic to capture, and we will examine it. Then, we will enable
network encryption and repeat these steps to examine our results with encrypted traffic.
1. Start the BackTrack virtual image and insert the USB Wi-Fi card into an open USB port.
Configure the virtual environment to ensure that the USB Wi-Fi card is being passed
through to the BackTrack environment. This configuration is outside the scope of this
exercise, but numerous tutorials are available on the Internet to assist with this setup
for both VMWare and VirtualBox.
2. Once BackTrack has started and you have logged in, start the GUI by typing startx and
pressing Enter, then open a terminal by clicking the Terminal icon in the taskbar.
3. Type iwconfig and press Return. You should see output similar to that shown in Figure 7-
11. Your wireless USB device should be named “wlan0” or something similar. If the wire-
less device does not appear, you must resolve this before moving forward with the exercise.

4. Note that the device details show it is in “managed” mode, which will not allow us to
capture traffic. To put the device into “monitor” mode to allow traffic capture, we will
use the airmon-ng utility. Type airmon-ng and press Return. This will show the inter-
faces that can be used to capture wireless traffic. Your wireless device should appear
here, as shown in Figure 7-12. Make note of the interface name for later use.
5. Type airmon-ng start <interface name> and press Return to place the wireless
device into monitor mode. After completion, airmon-ng will inform you the device was
put into monitor mode on a newly created interface. Make note of the name for use
going forward. As displayed in Figure 7-13, the interface name we will use is mon0.
6. At this point, you need to disable any encryption currently in place on your wireless test
network. How to do this depends on your wireless network setup and is outside the
scope of this exercise.
7. Type wireshark and press Enter. This will start the Wireshark application, and you
should see the GUI. Take note that the mon0 interface is listed as available for use in
Wireshark, as shown in Figure 7-14. Click on the mon0 interface to begin capturing
wireless traffic.
8. Now, attach the second system to the unencrypted wireless network and open a Web
browser. Visit the Web site located at www.kennesaw.edu

9. After the page loads on the second system, stop the Wireshark capture by clicking the
icon with the network card and the red “x,” as displayed in Figure 7-15. The icon has
a green circle around it, for easier viewing in the figure.
10. In the Filter window, type tcp.port eq 80 and click the Apply button. This will filter
out unwanted traffic from the view.
11. Scroll down to locate the first packet that has “HTTP” as the protocol and “GET” in the
Info column. Right-click on this packet and choose Follow TCP Stream, as displayed in
Figure 7-16.
12. A new window will pop up, allowing you to read the entire contents of the HTTP
request from the Kennesaw.edu Web site. Scroll down to view the content, noting that
it is all in plaintext.
Now, we will capture traffic from an encrypted wireless network and examine the dif-
ferences between the two.
13. Enable encryption on your wireless test network. How to do this depends on your wire-
less network setup and is outside the scope of this exercise.
14. Type wireshark and press Enter.
15. Now, attach the second system to the encrypted wireless network and open a Web
browser. Visit the Web site located at www.kennesaw.edu.
16. After the page loads on the second system, stop the Wireshark capture.
17. In the Filter window, type tcp.port eq 80 and click the Apply button.
As you will note, there are no packets displayed in the window at all. This is because traffic
has been encrypted and is unable to be viewed without having the proper decryption keys.

Introduction
As mentioned in Chapter 2, it is important to delineate the Internet from the World Wide
Web (WWW). The Internet is a physical set of networks (the hardware, if you will), whereas
the WWW is a set of applications (the software) that runs on top of the Internet. In fact, the
Internet supports a host of services to help users access their information, entertainment, and
communication needs. The laundry list of services available is beyond the scope of this book.
Technically, the Web consists exclusively of documents linked via Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP). For our purposes, however, it will include many related applications that are gener-
ally described as “the Web”—applications like the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3).
This chapter focuses on the key Internet services in use, their vulnerabilities, the attacks upon
them, and the various countermeasures, with the most attention paid to Web applications.
This is simply because the majority of Internet attacks are still aimed at these applications.
Internet Services
It’s a common misconception that the Web sites we use every day comprise the entirety of the
Internet. In fact, a recent article in Wired magazine argued that the Web is dead, given that
other services available on the Internet, such as video, e-mail, and peer-to-peer services, have
surpassed the Web in popularity.1 Figure 8-1 shows Cisco’s analysis of the Cooperative Asso-
ciation for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) data, indicating the trends of various Internet
It was finally time. After all the effort analyzing network and system vulnerabilities,
the EBS IT team had to turn its attention to the Web environment. Although Noah
Atwater had spent many of his years at EBS maintaining the Web servers, he had lit-
tle knowledge of the various applications running atop the infrastructure. There was
a separate programmer responsible for maintaining the applications and creating the
necessary content for EBS.
In order to properly address the security of the Web environment, Noah and Paige
were going to have to address the security of the network architecture supporting
the Web servers, analyze the security of the Web servers themselves, and then move
up the stack to investigate the applications, protocols, and programming languages
to discover what vulnerabilities existed. The complexity of the challenge intimidated
the team, but it couldn’t be avoided—they were going to become entangled in
the Web.

communications. The point is that Internet security depends not only on securing Web sites
(although we will focus mostly on that) but also on securing the various services that use the
interconnected networks. This section briefly explains some of the more popular services, their
vulnerabilities, and the security solutions that protect them. Some key information about the
most common Internet services is provided in Table 8-1.
SMTP, POP, and IMAP
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send Internet mail, whereas the Post
Office Protocol 3 (POP3) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are used to
receive Internet mail. For example, if an organization installs an e-mail server like Microsoft
Exchange to allow the company to share e-mail over the Internet, the e-mail server normally
has SMTP and POP3 enabled to facilitate this communication. Both are higher-layer proto-
cols that operate within the Application layer of the OSI reference model. For e-mail commu-
nication, SMTP uses TCP and UDP ports 25, POP3 uses TCP and UDP ports 110, and
IMAP uses TCP and UDP ports 143.

Attacks on E-mail The bulk of e-mail attacks involve an attacker or malicious software
that uses an e-mail server to send messages from the victim organization. In its early stages,
SMTP had no way of authenticating users prior to e-mail being sent. Eventually, the Internet
community realized that some form of user authentication was needed in order to minimize
the amount of spam being generated on a daily basis. The SMTP-AUTH feature was
included in the Extended SMTP (ESMTP) protocol to address this need. Unfortunately,
attackers were soon able to use the SMTP-AUTH feature itself to attack SMTP servers or
to send spam by compromising a legitimate user’s account.
Another major attack involving an SMTP server occurs when an e-mail server administrator
does not restrict who can use the SMTP server to send e-mail. This type of configuration is
referred to as an open relay. Attackers will scan the Internet looking for open relays that they
can use to send spam. This allows the attackers to use the e-mail system to send e-mail anon-
ymously. In the case of worms, malicious software can also use the open relay to propagate
itself across the Internet.
Mail bombing is another threat to e-mail servers. During this type of attack, a malicious user
sends a flood of e-mail to the e-mail server—essentially, an e-mail-based denial of service
(DoS) attack.

Security Solutions The most effective methods for preventing mail attacks are to apply
security patches and restrict mail relayed on the e-mail server. Unfortunately, many e-mail
server software packages either fully allow relaying or fully deny it. However, with the help
of third-party software, organizations can maintain more precise control over the messages
that come into and go out of the organization. In general, the following policies should be
observed:
●
A sender with a valid internal IP address should be allowed to send e-mail to internal
e-mail addresses.
●
A sender with a valid internal IP address should be allowed to send e-mail to external
e-mail addresses.
●
A recipient with a valid internal e-mail address should be allowed to receive e-mail
from external e-mail addresses.
●
A sender with an external e-mail address should be prohibited from sending e-mail to
other external e-mail addresses.2
Server administrators should test their e-mail server configurations to be sure the server is
not incorrectly set up as an open relay. Several publically accessible Web sites can be used to
test a server configuration—for example, www.spamhelp.org/shopenrelay or www.abuse.net/
relay.html.
Real-time blacklisting (RBL) lists are another way to defend against spam attacks. RBLs are
collections of IP addresses of known spam sources on the Internet, and they can be easily inte-
grated into most SMTP server configurations. When a connection request is received by the
SMTP server, it checks the IP address of the requester against the RBL and denies the connec-
tion if the address is on the list.
The “POP before SMTP” authentication method is another way to defend against improper
use of an SMTP server. With this method, a user must be authenticated against an associated
POP server before being allowed to send mail through the SMTP server. Once authenticated,
the SMTP server records the IP address of the sender and allows mail to be sent from there
for a period of time. Care should be taken with how long that period lasts, though; an open-
ing could be created from which attackers at that same IP address could later send e-mail.
FTP
Most users are familiar with the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is a simple method of
transferring files between computer systems. An example of a popular freeware FTP client
(CoreFTP Lite) is shown in Figure 8-2. FTP operates in the Application layer of the OSI ref-
erence model and only uses TCP for communication. It actually requires two TCP ports for
communication: a command port and a data port. The command port communicates over
TCP port 21, and the data port normally uses TCP port 20.
In active mode, the FTP client connects from a TCP source port greater than 1024 (N) to the
FTP server’s destination TCP port 21. The FTP client then starts listening on TCP port (N+1)
and identifies for the FTP server the port to which it is listening. The server then connects to
the destination port (N+1) on the client side and sends data from the server’s TCP port 20.
As shown in Figure 8-3, in active mode, the server must be able to establish a connection to
the client for data transfer.

In passive mode, the FTP client does not listen and wait for the server connection. Instead, it
initiates a connection from a TCP source port greater than 1024 (N) to the FTP server port
21. The FTP client, as shown in Figure 8-4, makes another connection from TCP port N+1
to the FTP server’s port 20 to transfer data.
With passive mode, a trusted internal FTP client makes an outgoing request to the FTP
server. With active mode, the untrusted FTP server makes a connection to the listening client.
Using the passive mode, an intervening firewall is more likely to allow FTP traffic because the
trusted client is initiating the connection.
TFTP The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is very similar to FTP. TFTP is used to
transfer data files as well, and it too operates within the Application layer of the OSI refer-
ence model. Most often, TFTP is used on network appliances to transfer configuration files,
backups, and boot files. However, TFTP differs from FTP in the following ways:
Figure 8-2

●
It is implemented over UDP instead of TCP, which allows for less overhead and more speed.
●
It is a lightweight implementation of FTP that has far fewer features.
●
It does not allow for authentication.
●
It does not require two different communication links and only uses UDP port 69 for
data transfers.

Attacks on FTP and TFTP When configuring an FTP server, administrators can set up
anonymous FTP access. This can lead to a major problem with FTP in that it allows anyone
with a network connection and an FTP client to access the FTP server and the files served.
When properly configured to afford anonymous users only very limited access, the FTP server
works well. However, in many cases, administrators mistakenly give an anonymous user too
many rights to the server or do not restrict the areas in which a visitor can read files.
Another major problem with FTP is that data is transferred in plaintext. If an abuser is able to
sniff the network traffic using a packet sniffer, he or she will be able to see usernames, pass-
words, and any other sensitive data.
In addition to the previous weaknesses, TFTP has an additional threat exposure in that it does
not allow authentication. Because TFTP is typically shipped with a variety of systems and
even network devices, an abuser can use TFTP to simply transfer sensitive data off the system.
This poses a serious threat to both computer systems and network devices.

Security Solutions To reduce the overall risk, the best option is to not enable an
FTP or TFTP server at all. Both actions pose serious threats because they have the poten-
tial of resulting in a server not requiring authentication, and because they send data in
plaintext.
If FTP or TFTP must be used, then encryption and authentication should be employed. Both
FTP implemented over SSL and Secure Copy (SCP) are secure substitute methods of transfer-
ring files. Each employs encryption techniques to hide data while in transit. Also, each enables
only users with the proper credentials to gain access to the FTP server.
Anonymous FTP access should be avoided whenever possible. When it is not possible to avoid
it, you should apply and maintain the latest patches for the operating system and FTP server
software. Additionally, you should ensure that anonymous users have only limited access to
files and directories. Remember, because the FTP connection is anonymous, everyone has
access; worse, there’s no record of who accessed your files.
Telnet
Like FTP, Telnet is an Application-layer protocol that allows users to connect to a remote
computer. However, instead of transferring files, Telnet allows users to connect a remote
shell to run programs, view files, and perform a variety of other operations as if they were

using the system locally. For example, PuTTY, shown in Figure 8-5, is a free Telnet client
that also supports Secure Shell (SSH).
There are still some servers that have Telnet enabled, which is good for functionality but bad
for security. Therefore, a special effect must be made to close any unnecessary security holes.
Telnet communicates over TCP port 23, whereas SSH communicates over TCP port 22.
For more information on Telnet, refer to RFC 854. For more informa-
tion on SSH, refer to RFC 4253.
Attacks on Telnet Like FTP, Telnet is susceptible to misconfiguration and poor admin-
istration. The security of the Telnet server can be undermined by guest users with too many
rights, users with no passwords, or a policy of requiring no passwords at all.
However, the biggest threat exposure is that the Telnet protocol sends traffic unencrypted
over the network. This opens the door for sniffers to monitor Telnet sessions.
Security Solutions As with FTP, the best security practice is to not use Telnet at all.
Use Secure Shell (SSH) or some other encrypted remote session tool instead. In addition,
make sure that all users have the appropriate rights and strong passwords that change
regularly.
If Telnet must be used, avoid having the server available to the Internet. Then, look to have
external users attach to the internal network using a virtual private network (VPN). This is
by no means a perfect solution, as the traffic from the VPN server to the Telnet server would
still be in plaintext, but it does reduce the overall attack surface on the Telnet server.

SNMP
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), as its name implies, is an Application-
layer management protocol that is used to monitor the status and performance of network
devices and systems. For example, the HP Network Management Center (used to be OpenView)
product is able to monitor SNMP-enabled devices (and other network communications) to
provide IT organizations with real-time information on the overall health of the environment,
as shown in Figure 8-6.
To provide monitoring, an SNMP agent must be installed on a desired host or network
device. The SNMP agent then monitors and collects information according to the instructions
and format of a particular management information base (MIB). A MIB is designed to trans-
late information sent from a particular agent or class of agents. This information can then be
communicated to a central management system via SNMP traps. A trap is a simple message
providing status information about the monitored device.
SNMP traffic occurs over TCP port 161 and UDP port 161. SNMP traps are sent back to the
server over TCP port 162 and UDP port 162.
For more information on SNMP, refer to RFC 1157.

Attacks on SNMP SNMP provides information about the monitored system, such as IP
address, operating system and version, host name, and a variety of other configuration
options. Most of the weaknesses with SNMP occur with Version 1 of SNMP. SNMP v1
agents need a community string, which acts as a simple password, in order to allow read or
write operations. In many cases, administrators do not change these strings from the default
of “public.” This allows an attacker to gain access to the SNMP agent to read information
or use the setRequest command to perform actions on the target system. Because SNMP
v1 uses only simple authentication and sends data over the network in plaintext, it is ripe
for both break-in and eavesdropping.
Security Solutions Upgrading SNMP to a newer version (e.g., v3) affords network
administrators encryption, stronger authentication, and other security tools to protect
SNMP traffic. Additionally, for all SNMP agents, community strings must be changed to a
value that is hard to guess. Another strong security measure is to ensure that SNMP-
enabled systems are not connected to the Internet, thereby eliminating a public avenue of
attack.
LDAP
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is another Application-layer protocol that
rides on top of IP. Its purpose is to provide a communication framework with centralized
directories that hold a variety of useful data. For example, manufacturers implement LDAP
to communicate to a central database of users, user rights, and user properties that have
access to particular systems or applications.
The LDAP protocol defines six standard operations that can be performed:
●
Authenticating to the directory
●
Searching the directory
●
Reading attributes from the directory
●
Adding entries to the directory
●
Modifying entries in the directory
●
Removing entries from the directory
LDAP communicates over TCP port 389 and UDP port 389.
For more information on LDAP, refer to RFC 4511.
Attacks on LDAP Like any sensitive data store, LDAP is a target because of the sensi-
tive nature of the data it stores (e.g., user attributes). It’s crucial that LDAP servers be hard-
ened and patched regularly. The most common attacks on LDAP servers are very similar to
SQL injection attacks (SQL injection attacks are covered in more detail later in this chapter)
in that the attack manipulates the data sent from a Web page or Web application to the
LDAP server.3 These LDAP injection attacks seek to insert, modify, or delete data from the
LDAP server without proper authentication.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Security Solutions Because LDAP servers and applications tend to send sensitive data,
such as usernames and attributes, it is important to protect these servers with the typical
security controls: physical security, user ID management, and rights management. Again,
make sure these servers are patched regularly.
To thwart LDAP injection attacks, it is critical that any Web page or application gathering
data from the user first scrub the data to only pass valid information back to the LDAP
server. This countermeasure, called input validation, serves to prevent a variety of Web
attacks.
NNTP
Many users like to communicate with other users in the forum-type environment of news-
groups. Designed to facilitate Usenet newsgroup communications, the Network News Trans-
fer Protocol (NNTP) is similar to SMTP in architecture and function. NNTP runs over TCP
port 119 and is another Application-layer protocol. Clients use a newsgroup client, like the
one shown in Figure 8-7, to connect via NNTP to a central newsgroup server to download
and post selective messages.
For more information on NNTP, refer to RFC 3977.

Attacks on NNTP News servers tend to reside in a DMZ and are accessible from the
Internet, which places more risk on the server. Though not an attack on NNTP itself, Usenet
groups and various sites carrying user forums tend to post links to malicious files or Web sites.
Security Solutions Many users will have access to the system, so make sure NNTP ser-
vers are patched regularly and the newsgroup content is continuously scanned for malware.
If you happen to moderate a user forum, police the posts for malicious or inappropriate
content. Additionally, you should implement user authentication, when possible.
DNS
For a domain name typed into a Web browser, there must be a helper service to translate
that domain name into an IP address for proper routing. This is accomplished by Domain
Name System (DNS) servers that are installed within organizations, at ISPs, and at key points
within the Internet. DNS operates within the Application layer and allows clients to access
these various DNS servers to perform the translation. The distributed nature of this informa-
tion store allows users to type a domain name (e.g., facebook.com) into a Web browser and
get the same response regardless of where the user is located.
DNS also helps Internet services other than the Web—for example, FTP and newsgroups—
make the translation between domain names and IP addresses. The DNS software performs a
query to the DNS server over UDP port 53. Using UDP makes the query quick and efficient.
DNS Overview DNS operations are split among three components: DNS servers, the
DNS protocol, and DNS clients (otherwise known as resolvers). On the Internet, BIND
(Berkeley Internet Name Domain) software is the most prevalently used software for DNS
servers. Fortunately, almost all modern operating systems include a DNS client to make
effective DNS queries. A typical DNS query exchange for a host that exists within the same
organization is shown in Figure 8-8. A DNS typical query for an Internet system is shown in
Figure 8-9.
DNS queries are initiated by clients to resolve a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to its IP
address. A FQDN uniquely identifies a host by representing the host name, subdomain,
second-level domain (SLD)—or possibly a country code second-level domain (ccSLD)—and
Host1.sampleorg.com asks:
What is the IP address host2.sampleorg.com?

The IP address for host2.sampleorg.com
is 10.0.0.110.

ultimately is controlled by the IANA Name Registration Authority. Note that the complete
listing of TLDs can be found on the IANA Web site at www.iana.org/domains/root/db/.
These FQDNs are stored in a resource record (RR) within the DNS database. The RR indi-
cates key attributes that help to direct traffic within a specific domain. Table 8-2 lists some of
the major types outlined in RFC 1035.
DNS Zones In addition, the Internet DNS infrastructure is divided into zones. Zones pro-
vide a mechanism to divide ownership responsibility among various DNS servers and the
organizations they serve. For example, each zone contains all the hosts and subdomains
that end with the zone’s domain name. The DNS server considered authoritative—that is,
holding the most accurate information for the zone—is identified by the first record in the
zone, called the Start of Authority or SOA for the zone.4
A zone’s NS server must get the latest DNS translation information from the organization’s
ISP. The ISP, in turn, must synchronize the data store with the TLD owner. These bulk trans-
fers of data are called zone transfers. To allow the reliable exchange of this information, DNS
switches to TCP for zone transfers on port 53.
For more information on DNS, refer to RFCs 1034 and 1035.
Attacks on DNS Attacks on DNS communication usually come in three varieties. The
first type, the DNS open resolver, is similar to e-mail open relays in that the DNS server is
open for anyone internal or external to the organization to query all the information from
the DNS server to see the zone’s complete list of hosts and their translations to IP addresses.
An attacker can then use this information to footprint, or perform reconnaissance, on the
target organization.
The second type of attack, called DNS poisoning, consists of inserting incorrect translation
information within the DNS server (or within the communication between the resolver and
server) in order to take a legitimate domain name and point the resolver to a malicious server,
thereby secretly subverting the session. This can be accomplished by inserting malicious

information into the DNS cache (used to speed up communication by allowing the DNS
server to provide translation results without having to look up frequent queries), modifying
the DNS records themselves, performing a man-in-the-middle attack on the DNS communica-
tion, or by tricking DNS servers into believing a malicious system is the authoritative name
server, which is what infamously happened with the so-called Kaminsky bug.5
The third type of attack seeks to cause a DNS denial of service by asking the DNS server to
perform a large number of recursive lookups or searches for domain information not located
within its own zone, as shown in Figure 8-10. Most DNS servers have this recursive ability
enabled by default so that the DNS server can perform an added service to its clients; how-
ever, the recursive queries can easily be manipulated.

Limit zone transfers to trusted IP addresses. An attacker should not be able to trick a
DNS server into performing a zone transfer with a malicious system.
●
Employ DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to digitally sign infor-
mation provided to the resolver. DNSSEC attempts to provide a level of authenticity
to the DNS communication to avoid DNS poisoning attacks. DNSSEC is outlined in
RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035.
●
Disable recursive query ability to avoid DoS attacks on the DNS server.
Web Overview
Despite arguments to the contrary, the Web continues to be actively used. In this textbook, we
distinguish the Web from the Internet itself. The Internet is that worldwide network of inter-
connected data communication networks that interoperate using the IP protocol. The Web is
the HTTP-driven content that is transmitted over the Internet. As security professionals, there-
fore, we must continue to protect our organizations from Web attacks that seek to subvert the
information we publish to the Web and the services we offer to our customers over the Web.
In order for you to be prepared to protect that content, we will begin with a discussion of the
fundamentals of Web communication, how it makes use of servers, and how it delivers con-
tent and services to browser clients.
Web Client/Server Architecture
There are three fundamental aspects of Web communication: the server, the client, and the
communication protocol. Although a particular Web server may also be a Web client (and
vice versa), the key distinction is that a server hosts Web content and a client requests access
to content. Throughout this section, these broad definitions will continue to apply.
Web Server There are some fundamental requirements that systems need to meet in
order to serve as a Web server. The obvious one is that the system needs to be connected
to the Internet (for a public Web server) or to an internal network (for an intranet Web
server). The system must also have a Web server installed. Popular packages include:
Apache HTTP Server, from the Apache Software Foundation; Internet Information
Services (IIS), from Microsoft; and NGINX, from the NGINX open-source community.7 To
be a useful Web server, the system must also have content to share and allow incoming con-
nections to access the content. For traditional HTTP traffic (more on that in a moment),
incoming TCP/UDP ports 80 need to be open for incoming requests, and for encrypted
HTTP traffic, TCP port 443 must allow incoming connections.
Web Client There are numerous ways that client systems can access Web servers, but the
most common way is to use a Web browser like Mozilla’s Firefox, Microsoft’s Internet
Explorer, Google’s Chrome, or Apple’s Safari. These applications hide much of the details
of the HTTP communications from the user and translate the host of Web programming
language automatically for content display. For those users who are too paranoid to allow
the client to translate the numerous programming elements automatically, Linux and UNIX
distributions allow command-line Web clients like Lynx or wget.

HTTP Communication Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basis for Web
communication. (The 1.1 version of HTTP is explained in RFC 2616.) It consists of requests
and responses. These form the basis for the client requesting information from the Web server
and the Web server sending information to the client. Table 8-3 outlines some common HTTP
request methods. Table 8-4 lists some common response codes, and Figure 8-11 shows how a
typical HTTP session is initiated.

HTTP communication and its encrypted counterpart, HTTPS, form the foundation for Web
communication and for sessions between clients and servers. There are a number of tools for
viewing these communications at the OSI Application layer. Traditional network sniffers, such
as tcpdump or Wireshark, are always a good option. However, there are a number of HTTP-
specific sniffers that can manipulate the HTTP commands being used—for example, HttpFox
(shown in Figure 8-12) and HttpWatch.
Web Programming Languages
Although the Web was built on the basis of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the use of
various programming languages has greatly expanded the content, use, and user experience of
the Web. This section covers HTML and some of the more popular programming languages.
HTML HTML is a key component of the Web, working in conjunction with HTTP to
move content from servers to clients. Similar to the formatting in a word-processing applica-
tion, HTML, using tags, tells Web browsers how to format the content displayed to the
user. Table 8-5 displays some of the common HTML tags.
HTML Versions Since its inception, HTML has gone through a number of changes. The list
that follows documents the various major versions and the functionality introduced with each.

Language (SGML), a system for “marking up” documents by “representing structural,

presentational, and semantic information alongside content.”9 HTML added the
HREF tag invented by Tim Berners-Lee to link documents.10
●
HTML 2.0—Formed first official HTML standard (RFC 1866). Codified many of the
informal tags and HTML usage already in existence.11
●
HTML 3.2—Provided support for style sheets, tables, footnotes, forms, and a host of
additional features.12
●
HTML 4.01—Provided improvements on features such as style sheets, tables, and
forms and extended the feature set by adding mechanisms for scripting, frames,
embedding objects, and mixed direction text.13
●
HTML 5—This standard is still a work-in-progress but promises to provide a single
language that can be written in HTML or XML syntax, improve interoperability
among implementations, make improvements to the markup language, and provide
support for emerging Web applications.14
CSS CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) standardizes the HTML formatting for an entire Web
site by allowing developers to customize fonts, tables, and other page elements. For exam-
ple, if changes need to be made to the font used on the Web site, the developer can change
the font within the CSS, thereby updating all the uses of that font on the Web site, rather
than have to manually put <font> tags on every single page.
CSS styles are typically saved within a .css file, and within a particular Web page, they are
linked to using the following tag: <link
rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="example.css" />. Figure 8-13 shows the interaction between the standard
HTML tags, their customization using an external style sheet, and the modified display.
XML One of the limitations of HTML is that it was designed as a display language. You
use it to format text and other elements so as to direct the client in how to view the data.
However, if developers want to send or store data easily, they have to use the Extensible
Markup Language (XML). XML is an extension to HTML that allows developers to define
their own tags for structure. In other words, they can come up with their own dictionaries
of tags—what each tag means and how the Web application or browser will handle the
XML as it is passed to the client.
Here is a simple example of XML that defines a small retail catalog:
<retail_catalog>
<clothing>
<sku>3489222</sku>
<description>Women’s Cotton Blouse</description>
<price>$34.95</price>
</clothing>
<jewelry>
<sku>1299001</sku>
<description>Women’s Gold Watch</description>
<price>$126.99</price>

CGI A common misconception is that the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a program-
ming language in and of itself. Actually, CGI is an API (application programming interface)
that allows external programs or scripts to interact with a Web server. As defined in RFC
3875, CGI provides a simple interface for running external programs or scripts on an
HTTP server.15
Perl One of the first programming languages used for its CGI capability, Perl was devel-
oped in 1987 by Larry Wall as an interpreted language (based on C syntax) that helps pro-
vide a more robust scripting capability for UNIX. One of the biggest strengths of Perl is its
text-manipulation abilities. Using regular expressions, Perl can easily parse text for a variety
of purposes. Here is a sample Perl script used as a CGI program, in which the program
queries various Web server variables and uses those for creating dynamic HTML output
based on the user properties.
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$remoteIp = $ENV{’REMOTE_ADDR’};
$remoteClient = $ENV{’HTTP_USER_AGENT ’};
print "content-type: text/html \n\n";
print "<html> \n";

print "<h1>Welcome to my first CGI script!</h1> \n";
print "<p>You’re visiting from the following IP address: ",
$remoteIp, "</p> \n";
print "<p>You’re using the following Web browser: ",
$remoteClient, "</p> \n";
print "</html>";
exit (0);
This script creates the following HTML for display on the client side:
<html>
<h1>Welcome to my first CGI script!</h1>
<p>You’re visiting from the following IP address: 10.1.23.129</p>
<p>You’re using the following Web browser: Mozilla/5.0
(Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15)
Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15</p>
</html>
PHP PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP as a recursive abbreviation) was devel-
oped specifically to allow developers to create dynamically generated HTML content. PHP
was originally developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995 and named after his set of Perl scripts
called Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter. The modern versions of PHP are based on the
wholesale rewrite to version 3.0 by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski in 1997.16
Like most CGI scripts, PHP languages are interpreted on the server-side prior to content being
delivered to the user. This allows the use of server variables, connections to databases, and a
number of other features that create dynamic content. The following is a simple PHP script to
determine whether the user agent reported by the Web server contains MSIE—thus, indicating
the use of Internet Explorer.
<html>
<h1>Welcome to my first PHP script!</h1>
<p>Looking for Internet Explorer...</p>
<?php
if (strpos($_SERVER[’HTTP_USER_AGENT’], ’MSIE’) !== FALSE) {
echo ’You are using Internet Explorer.<br />’;
}
else {
echo ’You must be using a browser other than Internet Explorer.’;
}
?>
</html>
This script then generates the following HTML to display to the client Web browser:
<html>
<h1>Welcome to my first PHP script!</h1>
<p>Looking for Internet Explorer...</p>
You must be using a browser other than Internet Explorer.
</html>

JavaScript In 1995, Netscape, to coincide with its release of Netscape Navigator 2.0, was
looking to add support for Java applets. Brendan Eich was hired to lead the team that cre-
ated this support via a scripting language called JavaScript. The syntax of the language is
based on Java and has a fairly low “barrier to entry” compared with other scripting lan-
guages, such as Perl.17
JavaScript was originally developed as a client-side language, which means the code is inter-
preted on the client side instead of on the Web server. (Today, this has evolved so that various
implementations of JavaScript can now be interpreted on the Web server side using custom-
ized Web applications.) The following HTML page with embedded JavaScript demonstrates a
simple use of displaying text if scripting is enabled on the client side.
<html>
<h1>Welcome to my first JavaScript!</h1>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(’Hello World!’);
</script>
<noscript>
<p>Your browser either does not support JavaScript, or you have JavaScript
turned off.</p>
</noscript>
</html>
Using a browser with scripting enabled, the following HTML is generated. You can see that
the client gets all the content since no server-side interpretation is involved.
<html>
<h1>Welcome to my first JavaScript!</h1>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(’Hello World!’);
</script>
<noscript>
<p>Your browser either does not support JavaScript, or you have JavaScript
turned off.</p>
</noscript>
</html>
AJAX The term “AJAX” was coined by Jesse James Garrett in an article published in
2005.18 In the article, Garrett described a new approach to Web applications that allowed
a more interactive user experience. “AJAX” stands for “Asynchronous JavaScript and
XML” and does not refer to a new programming language but to a new use of existing
technologies. The idea is to have a number of mini-requests from the client to the server to
make the content seem dynamic. This illusion is achieved by implementing a program
exchange like the one illustrated in Figure 8-14. The key aspect of this exchange is centered
on the XMLHttpRequest function in JavaScript. This request will gather XML data from
the server and load the response directly into a script.19 This approach has revolutionized
Web site interactions, as seen in examples like Google’s implementation of the Google Talk
instant messaging client within the Gmail Web site.

Other Languages There are a number of other programming languages in use around
the Web. Most notably, Ruby and Python have made huge gains in Web programming
mindshare in recent years. Microsoft has developed technologies specific for Windows that
use Internet Explorer and Jscript or VBScript as programming languages of choice. We
won’t cover these languages in detail, given that most of them are similar to languages like
Perl, PHP, and JavaScript and don’t, on their own, add much to the security discussion
about Web applications.
Threats and Vulnerabilities in Web Applications
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization dedicated to collab-
oration, discussion, and education regarding the security of Web applications. OWASP is a
nonprofit organization that releases all its materials under a free and open-source software
license. This section will use OWASP’s Top Ten Project (see www.owasp.org/index.php/
Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) as the basis to discuss the top risks to Web applications.
The client Web browser opens a Web
page containing JavaScript code.
The JavaScript routine creates an
XMLHttpRequest object when executed.
The XMLHttpRequest object sends an
HttpRequest to the Web Server.
The HttpRequest request is processed by
the server and returns relevant XML data.
The XMLHttpRequest object processes
the returned XML data and updates the
appropriate information on the Web page.

Injection
In 2010, OWASP determined that injection attacks were the top risk to Web applications.
Most notably, these attacks use a variety of techniques to inject data into a SQL command
and thereby add, modify, or remove data from the back-end database communicating with
the Web application. There are other injection attacks against LDAP, the underlying OS, or
other components tied to the Web server using similar techniques.
The basic concept behind a SQL injection attack involves modifying the data sent via a URL
or via an HTML form to the Web server. For example, a Web form might ask a user for a
name in order to look up the person’s e-mail address. That data is then passed to the data-
base in the form of the following SQL statement:
SELECT email FROM users WHERE name = ’<name field contents>’;
The statement is asking the database to return the email field from the table users when the
name field equals a particular value. Thus, if the Web visitor enters the name “David,” the
SQL passed is the following:
SELECT email FROM users WHERE name = ’David’;
The result of the query would then be the e-mail address associated with David.
An attacker, however, can manipulate the data returned by simply modifying the data
entered into the form field. For example, an attack can enter the following text:
’ or 1=1;--
The data passed then creates the following SQL statement:
SELECT email FROM users WHERE name = ’’ or 1=1;--’;
This statement translates to return the e-mail address for the user with the name field blank
or in instances where 1=1. In SQL, the “--” denotes a comment, so the database will ignore
the proceeding characters. The fact that 1 will always equal 1 makes the SQL statement
always true and effectively turns the SQL statement into:
SELECT email FROM users;
That statement will return all e-mail addresses stored within the table named users. A more
nefarious attack could perform a task more damaging by passing the following value:
’; drop table users;--
This value would then translate to the following SQL statement:
SELECT email FROM users WHERE name = ’’; drop table users;--’;
The statement would effectively destroy the table named users, assuming the attacker had the
appropriate privileges to do so within the database.
Security Solutions Here are some preventative measures to ward off an SQL injection
attack:20
●
Make sure there is limited access to the Web application within the database, to
prevent attacks that remove data.

●
Use prebuilt statements that do not take user input. This creates more work for the
developer, given that all possible SQL queries have to be predefined, but it also elimi-
nates the direct translation of user input into a query that interacts with the database.
●
Instead of sending SQL queries to the database, invoke stored procedures to take the
appropriate actions on the database data. Stored procedures are saved within the
database and do not allow user interaction. A key to using stored procedures is to
make sure the Web application does not have too high a privilege to access adminis-
trative stored procedures.
●
Scrub all user input to make sure no invalid characters are passed in the SQL state-
ment. Although this approach is still prone to problems when the attacker obfuscates
characters with ASCII codes, the idea is to remove quotes, parentheses, dashes, and
other SQL characters that can affect the behavior of the SQL query.
●
Alternatively, use a “white list” or simply indicate which type of data is acceptable
and discard the rest. For example, instead of removing quotes from the user input,
check to see if letters exist, then discard everything else.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities may be the least understood in that the attack code
is not sent from the client to the server, as with injection attacks. Instead, a server sends
unverified data to the client, and the client, in turn, executes code that exploits the Web
browser. This type of attack should be rare, in that the majority of Web sites are trusted
and legitimate. However, the attack occurs because a legitimate Web site has a vulnerability
that can be exploited by attackers who then cause the Web site to send malicious code to the client.
A simple approach to an XSS attack is to find Web sites that take user input and redisplay
the results to the user, without scrubbing results. As an example, Acunetix hosts an HTML
form at http://testasp.vulnweb.com/search.asp that is susceptible to an XSS attack. By enter-
ing the following HTML code as a search result, the form accidentally processes the script
instead of looking for search terms:
<script>location.replace("http://www.yahoo.com");</script>
The result is that the user is redirected to yahoo.com without his knowledge. The key to this
attack, then, is to find a way to pass that to a user. In this case, the trick is to entice a user
into clicking the following link:
http://testasp.vulnweb.com/search.asp?tfSearch=<script>location.replace(“http://www.yahoo.com”)
%3B<%2Fscript>
A user might only look to see that the URL points to a trusted Web site and ignore the odd
script command contained within the URL. He then clicks the link expecting to be taken to a
known Web site, only to be automatically redirected to a malicious site. Or better yet, we can
transform the link so the user can’t see the script contents by substituting hex codes for URL
encoding, to form:
http://testasp.vulnweb.com/search.asp?tfSearch=%3C%73%63%72%69%70%74%3E%
6C%6F%63%61%74%69%6F%6E%2E%72%65%70%6C%61%63%65%28%27%

URL encoding allows the transmission of characters outside the stan-
dard ASCII character set by performing a simple ASCII code lookup,
prefixing the hexadecimal value with a percentage sign.
Security Solutions Here are some preventative measures to ward off an XSS attack:21
●
Make sure that untrusted data cannot be inserted into the HTML that is returned to a
client or into URL parameters passed to the Web application. In particular, don’t
allow any JavaScript to be inserted that is automatically run on the client side.
●
If untrusted data must be inserted into the returned HTML, all accepted input must be
scrubbed prior to its return. This means removing special characters, script tags, and
other characters that have special meaning to browsers, such as &, <, >, and “, or ‘.
●
Again, if untrusted data must be used to form a URL parameter, scrub all characters
to remove special URL characters.
Broken Authentication and Session Management
This is a broad category of vulnerabilities that occur when Web developers create applica-
tions with custom-made systems to authenticate users and manage the authentication during
an active Web session. The most obvious example is when the Web application does not
automatically end an authenticated session. For example, a user with a public kiosk com-
puter can log in to her bank’s Web site to check her account balances. She finishes, closes
the Web browser (without logging off from the bank’s Web site), and walks away. An
attacker watches the exchange, visits the bank’s Web site, and, with the user’s credentials, is
able to restart the same session. From there, the attacker has the same access as the user to
the user’s bank account information and transactions.
Security Solutions Here are some preventative measures to strengthen authentication
or session vulnerabilities:22
●
Require complex passwords for authentication. To avoid easy guessing, simple and
short passwords should not be allowed. Even better, use two-factor authentication,
such as tokens, to replace simple username and password combinations.
●
Use encrypted communication to transmit password information. Use a VPN, Secure
Socket Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security (TLS).
●
Make sure all user sessions are disconnected after a certain amount of inactivity. For
good measure, set an upper limit on a session, regardless of activity. Unfortunately,
this will require a legitimate user to authenticate again, but it will also disconnect an
attacker in the middle of a hijacked session.
●
Do not give away too much information in an authentication error message. Make
sure the error message lets a legitimate user know that the login attempt failed and he
has to retry, but don’t let an attacker know that, although the password is incorrect,
the username is valid.
●
Make sure an account is locked out after a certain number of invalid login attempts.
This prevents brute force password attacks.

●
Make sure session IDs are random and encrypted. This prevents attackers from
guessing valid sessions and hijacking them.
Insecure Direct Object References
In many cases, an HTML form will restrict the choices a user has by way of a drop-down
list, check box, or radio button, as shown in Figure 8-15. Most developers will then assume
that the choices or data passed to the Web application will be limited by these forced choices.
Unfortunately, that assumption is rarely valid.
The trick is that the data from the form is passed in either the URL or via an HTML POST
command. In both cases, an attacker can intercept the request, modify the choice, and try to
gain access to an object or values to which she would not normally be given access. One
example of this vulnerability is called directory traversal. A Web site’s URL could be the fol-
lowing: www.sampleorg.com/reference.php?view=article1.html.

Copyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part. Due to electronic rights, some third party content may be suppressed from the eBook and/or eChapter(s).
Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The intent is that the PHP script takes a variable called “view” that stores the page with the
article information the user wants to view. However, an attacker, seeing the exposed vari-
able, changes the URL to the following to expose a file unintended by the Web site developer
or administrator:
www.sampleorg.com/reference.php?view=../../../../etc/passwd.
Security Solutions Here are some preventative measures to avoid improper access to
files, database objects, or other data:23
●
Analyze your Web server’s settings to make sure the server prevents directory traversal
and other forms of insecure object access. Upgrade or modify the configuration to
ensure restrictions are added.
●
Check the access of the user whenever he is accessing authorized (or unauthorized)
objects. For example, within a database access request, make sure the user is authen-
ticated and has authorization to the requested data. Do not assume that, because the
data is coming from the Web server, that user’s input has been verified by the Web
application or Web server.
●
Avoid exposing key names, variable types, or other attributes that help the attacker
understand what has been passed. For example, map a list of file names to numbers
so the attacker has no control over changing the mapped data.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
A cross-site request forgery (CSRF—pronounced “sea-surf”) is an attack that exploits a Web
site’s trust or previous authentication of a user. Let’s assume a food-delivery Web site allows
you to order food online. You choose the food items and drinks, and pay via credit card. The
food is delivered in due time. However, the Web site performs the ordering tasks using pre-
dictable variables and actions, as shown in the following URL:
www.favoritefoodexample.com/app/orderFood.asp?food=pizza&foodamt=2&drink=2ltrCola
&drinkamt=2.
The URL passes parameters that define the type and amount of food ordered. The attacker,
however, does not want to modify his own order. He wants you to modify yours—better
yet, he wants you to enter an order when you did not intend to. To get you to do this, he
might create an invisible image and trick you into visiting the image on a Web site, using
the following HTML:
<img src =
"www.favoritefoodexample.com/app/orderFood.asp?food=pizza&foodam
t=2&drink=2ltrCola&drinkamt=2" width="0" height="0" />
The image is not visible to the user, but the user hopefully has session credentials or a valid
cookie that automatically logs him into the food-delivery site, initiates the order, and results
in the food being delivered. Now, imagine this same scenario, only with a banking applica-
tion in which money is transferred. That could be much more costly than a couple of pizzas.
Security Solutions Here are some preventative measures to keep attackers from trick-
ing users into inadvertently using CSRFs:24

●
Generate random tokens with the various HTML forms used by a user. These tokens
are then passed to the server for each of the sensitive Web application actions. In this
way, random parameters cannot be passed via URL (or form) to initiate these actions.
Make sure the secret token is sufficiently random to keep an attacker from guessing a
token identifier.
●
Use another challenge-response mechanism when the action is initiated. Mechanisms
like CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and
Humans Apart) allow a Web site to make sure that an automated script or system is
NOT making the request. A Web site can also simply insist that a user reauthenticate
himself for sensitive transactions.
●
On the client side, make sure users log off of every session to prevent an automatic
reinitiation of the same session.
Security Misconfiguration
Web servers are fairly complex to administer correctly. Like any system, there is always the
concern of keeping the underlying hardware and operating system secure. However, there is
the added concern of maintaining the Web server, any installed Web applications, and any
developer framework necessary to run the applications. If administrators do not stay up on
the latest patches, configuration changes, and versions, the Web server can be compromised.
Security Solutions There are a number of steps a system administrator can take to
ensure the security of the Web server:25
●
Stay informed of OS, Web server, and application updates as they are released from
the vendor.
●
Treat the Web server as a bastion host. Remove unnecessary applications, services,
daemons, accounts, or other components.
●
Secure application and development frameworks to make sure the applications do not
open vulnerabilities to the system.
●
Limit user accounts to those that are absolutely essential, and make sure that complex
passwords are used for the remaining user accounts.
●
Limit error messaging to Web visitors in order to limit the information an attacker
can use to find vulnerabilities.
Insecure Cryptographic Storage
Given the threat of leaking sensitive personal information or personally identifiable informa-
tion (PII), more and more organizations are turning to encryption to make sure the data is
stored in a format that cannot be leaked if a system is compromised. Organizations must
first determine what data they want to encrypt, then they must make sure they are properly
encrypting the data in storage. In some cases, the data is encrypted while resting in a data-
base but not when sent to backup, or the encryption key is included on the backup. In other
cases, data is automatically decrypted when requested from a Web server, which could allow
an attacker to gain access to the data through an injection attack.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Security Solutions Here are a number of ways to properly encrypt Web data at rest:26
●
Use strong encryption algorithms, keys, and methods to encrypt sensitive information.
●
Encrypt backups of the data, but manage keys separately.
●
Verify that data can only be decrypted by authorized users or processes.
Failure to Restrict URL Access
URLs indicate the resources the client would like to request from a server. The following
URL indicates the client would like access to the orderFood.asp script:
www.favoritefoodexample.com/app/orderFood.asp.
However, there is nothing stopping a user from manipulating the URL to access resources
that are not normally accessible. For example, an attacker may venture a guess by trying the
following URL:
www.favoritefoodexample.com/app/admin_orderFood.asp.
If the Web server does not check for authorization, the user may be able to access a script
meant only for the administrator.
Security Solutions Here are some ways to restrict URL access:27
●
Make sure sensitive pages require authentication.
●
Check each user to make sure he or she has authorization to the specific page. Do not
assume that if users are authenticated, they have access.
Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
A network sniffer is a tool that can capture traffic traversing a network with both the packet
headers and the packet data. If the data is not encrypted, the sniffer can display the text
included in the packet. Similar to the need to encrypt data in storage, it is important for sen-
sitive information to be encrypted while in transit.
Security Solutions Here are some ways to make sure data is properly encrypted while
in transit:28
●
When sensitive information is transferred from the client to the server (and vice versa),
make sure it is encrypted with SSL and TLS.
●
Use the “secure” flag on all sensitive cookies.
●
Make sure the SSL is valid and issued by a trusted Internet certificate authority.
●
Make sure communications from the Web server to other back-end systems are encrypted.
Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
There are a number of instances where a Web site might need to redirect visitors to another
page. When pages are updated, edited, moved, or removed, a site administrator may want to
direct visitors to the new location or page. For example, an administrator may want to redi-
rect visitors from www.sampleorg.com/old.html to www.sampleorg.com/new.html. This can be
done a number of ways, but one way is to create a .htaccess file with the following entry:
Redirect 301 /old/old.html /new/new.html

Security Solutions Here are some preventative measures to make sure redirects are not
manipulated:29
●
Do not use them at all.
●
If they have to be used, make sure no parameters are fed to the redirects. An attacker
should not be able to inject the ultimate target of the redirect.
●
If you can, determine whether the parameters are valid and the user is authorized to
create a redirect.
Securing a Web Server
Like any system, there are a number of best practices with regards to securing a Web server.
NIST has published detailed guidelines for securing public Web servers in SP 800-44.30 Web
system administrators should use the following best practices:
●
Upgrade and patch the underlying operating system and Web server software.
●
Remove or disable unnecessary applications, services, and communications.
●
Limit user accounts, enforce a strong password policy, and monitor user activity.
●
Limit access to sensitive OS and Web resources.
●
Configure various security settings within the Web server and make sure the applica-
tion does not run with administrative privileges.
●
Do not use links in the public Web content to point to other files or directories on the
host or other network systems.
●
Disallow search engine indexing on sensitive Web directories.
●
Control access to specific pages and directories to ensure proper authorization.
Chapter Summary
■
It is important to delineate the Internet from the World Wide Web (WWW). The
Internet is a physical set of networks (the hardware, if you will), whereas the WWW
is a set of applications (the software) that runs on top of the Internet. Internet security
depends not only on securing Web sites but on securing the various services that use
the interconnected networks.
■
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send Internet mail, whereas the
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are
used to receive Internet mail. The most effective methods for preventing mail attacks
is to apply security patches and restrict mail relayed on the e-mail server.
■
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) are simple
methods of transferring files between computer system. They are often considered
unsecurable unless used in conjunction with SSL or some other additional means of
securing the communication channel they use.

■
Telnet is an Application-layer protocol that allows users to connect to a remote
computer, run programs, view files, and perform a variety of other operations as if
they were using the system locally. Like FTP, it must be used over a secured network
link in order to be used safely.
■
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Application-layer manage-
ment protocol that is used to monitor the status and performance of network devices
and systems.
■
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an Application-layer protocol
that provides a communication framework with centralized directories that hold a
variety of useful data.
■
Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an Application-layer protocol that allows
users to use a distributed protocol to download and post messages.
■
The Domain Name System (DNS) operates within the Application layer and allows
clients to perform the translation of domain names to network addresses. A related
protocol, Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), is employed to digi-
tally sign information provided to the resolver and attempts to provide a level of
authenticity to the DNS communication to avoid DNS poisoning attacks.
■
There are three fundamental aspects of Web communication: the server, the client,
and the communication protocol. A Web server shares content to incoming connec-
tions. The most commonly encountered Web client is a Web browser, which hides
much of the details of HTTP communication and provides an easy-to-use interface for
users. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basis for Web communication.
■
The Web was built on the basis of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), but the use
of various programming languages has greatly expanded the content, use, and user
experience of the Web:
●
Similar to the formatting in a word-processing application, HTML, using tags, tells
Web browsers how to format the content displayed to the user.
●
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) standardizes the HTML formatting for an entire Web
site by allowing developers to customize fonts, tables, and other page elements.
●
XML is an extension to HTML that allows developers to define their own tags for
structure.
●
CGI is an application programming interface (API) that allows external programs
or scripts to interact with a Web server.
●
Perl is an interpreted language (based on C syntax) that helps provide a more
robust scripting capability.
●
PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor was developed to allow developers to create dynam-
ically generated HTML content.
●
JavaScript was developed as a client-side language, which means the code is inter-
preted on the client side instead of on the Web server. It has evolved to a hybrid
model that runs on clients and servers.
●
“AJAX” stands for “Asynchronous JavaScript and XML”; it does not refer to a
new programming language but to a new use of existing technologies. The idea is

to have a number of mini-requests from the client to the server to make the con-
tent seem dynamic.
●
There are a number of other programming languages in use on the Web, such as
Ruby, Python, and VBScript.
■
Web Applications are subject to a variety of attacks, including:
●
Injection attacks, which use a variety of techniques to inject data into the commu-
nication channel from the client to the back-end server or database that is commu-
nicating with the Web application
●
Cross-site scripting (XSS), in which, instead of attack code being sent from the cli-
ent to the server, a server sends unverified data to the client, and then the client
executes code that exploits the Web browser
●
Broken authentication and session management, insecure direct object references,
cross-site request forgery, general security misconfiguration, insecure cryptographic
storage, failure to restrict URL access, insufficient transport layer protection,
unvalidated redirects and forwards

Hands-On Projects
In this project, we will examine various methods that attackers use to exploit
vulnerable Web-based applications. To complete this exercise, we will use
Badstore, a deliberately insecure Web-based application designed for
educational purposes. Badstore is available from the Badstore Web site at
www.badstore.net.
To complete this exercise, you will need to download the Badstore ISO and set it up to run
in a virtual environment. This setup is outside the scope of this exercise. Note that Badstore
is a vulnerable application by design. It should only be set up to run in a test environment,
not in a production environment on the Internet.
1. Start the Badstore virtual machine. After startup is complete, type ifconfig and press Enter.
Take note of the IP address assigned to the interface, as you will need this going forward.
2. Open a Web browser and enter http://<ip address> in the address window. You should
see the front page of the Web site, as shown in Figure 8-16. Note that the site greets you
as {Unregistered User}.
One of the most basic methods of attack against Web sites involves the use of SQL injection.
Attackers can leverage SQL injections to inflict damage, gain unauthorized access to an
application, or create new users and subsequently grant those users (i.e., themselves) unau-
thorized privileges.
3. Click the Login / Register link in the site menu. In the “Login to Your Account” sec-
tion, enter ’ or 1=1 or ’ in the Email Address field, as shown in Figure 8-17.

4. Click Login. Note that the greeting has changed from “Unregistered User” to “Test
User,” indicating that the SQL injection was successful.
5. Frequently, attackers gain information about an application via error messages. Click
the magnifying glass icon in the “Quick Item Search” area of the page, being careful to
leave the search field blank. As displayed in Figure 8-18, the application returns an error
message that provides valuable information about the structure of one of the tables
being used in the database. Attackers can use this information to make informed guesses
about the names and structures of the other tables used by the application.
6. Attackers can also gain information about an application by viewing a Web page’s
source code. Click the Login / Register link in the site menu. After the page loads,
right-click the page and choose the option to view the source code.
7. Copy the source code and paste it into a new document in a text editor.
8. Take a few minutes to examine the code. Toward the bottom of the code, you will see
the section that allows users to register for a new account. Careful observation will
show that the form has a hidden input value. The hidden value has the name “role”
and a value of “U.” Although you cannot be certain at this point, it seems reasonable
to think that these attributes set the new user account with “user” access. It may be pos-
sible to escalate privileges to administrator by changing the value from “U” to “A.” To
test this theory, we will need to submit the form with this changed value. Most attackers
will use some type of proxy application, such as Paros, to trap and change values like
this in transit. However, for this exercise, we will make the changes manually to the
source code, then load the modified source code in a browser and execute it.
9. In the text editor, change the value from “U” to “A,” as shown in Figure 8-19.

ACTION value associated with the POST command for this form. Search the code
until you find the text “Register for a New Account.” Behind that text is the beginning
of the FORM command that creates the new user account. Edit the ACTION value by
adding http://<IP address of Badstore> in front of the “/cgi-bin/badstore.cgi?action=
register” value already present. When done, your code should look like what is shown
in Figure 8-20.

13. In the upper-left corner of the Web page, note that you are logged in as “illegal user.”
14. Now, we will determine if this user has administrative privileges. To do this, we will
engage in basic URL manipulation. URL manipulation is the act of changing values in
a Web site’s URL, submitting the changes to the Web server, and observing what hap-
pens. Currently, the URL is http://<IP ADDRESS>/cgi-bin/badstore.cgi?action=register.
To manipulate this URL, replace “register” with “admin” and submit the page to the
server. You are now taken to the secret administration menu, as shown in Figure 8-22.
This figure also shows what the manipulated URL should look like.
15. From here, we can effectively function as an application administrator, giving us access
to all types of data and functionality. For example, we can now view credit card data by
selecting View Sales Reports and clicking Do It. The report is shown in Figure 8-23.
Further examination of the available menu options shows that we can now reset user
passwords, add and delete users, view user details, view technical details about the Web server,
and create a database backup that we can view in a Web browser.

Network Vulnerability Assessment
For years I’ve been saying security consists of protection, detection and response–and you
need all three to have good security. Before you can do a good job with any of these, you
have to assess your security. And done right, penetration testing is a key component of a
security assessment. — Bruce Schneier, renowned security technologist and author, blog
post from May 15, 2007
Upon completion of this material, you should be able to:
●Name the common categories of vulnerabilities
●Discuss common system and network vulnerabilities
●Find network vulnerabilities using scanning tools and in-depth penetration testing
●Access sources of information about vulnerabilities and determine how best to remediate
those vulnerabilities

Introduction
To maintain secure networks, information security professionals must be prepared to identify
network vulnerabilities, whether by hiring vulnerability assessment experts or by conducting
self-assessments using scanning and penetration tools. The term “vulnerability,” like so many
terms in information security, has a variety of meanings. To a systems developer, a vulnerabil-
ity may be a poorly designed input buffer that is at risk of an overflow attack, or it may be a
badly designed exception handler that allows an escalation of user privileges. To system
administrators, a vulnerability may be the presence of unneeded services, or it may be an eas-
ily guessed password.
In general, a network security vulnerability is a defect in a network device, device configura-
tion or implementation, or process or procedure that, if exploited, may result in a violation of
security policy, which in turn may lead to a loss of revenue, a loss of information, or a loss of
value to the organization.
Common Vulnerabilities
Network vulnerabilities fall into three major categories: defects in software or firmware, errors
in configuration or implementation, and weaknesses in processes and procedures.
Paige Davis was thinking about several computer attacks that had recently been
mentioned in the news. In one case, government, nonprofit, and commercial
documents had been stolen and posted on the Web. In another, several high-profile
commercial organizations had had malware lurking inside their networks for months.
In yet another, Internet infrastructure servers had been subjected to DoS attacks.
Without a doubt, some of these incidents resulted from the fact that the necessary
security controls had not been implemented. That didn’t explain all the attacks, how-
ever; even diligent security measures could not thwart dedicated, persistent attackers.
Even beyond prepping the PCI audit, EBS saw the value in conducting regular
security testing. By constantly testing the network and system defenses, it found pro-
blems before abusers did. What Paige needed to do was determine whether the find-
ings from these tests were being taken seriously and whether the vulnerabilities were
being addressed. How easily were the company’s networks being compromised?

Defects in Software or Firmware
Defects in software or firmware (i.e., software that is embedded in a device such as a router
or network switch) are common. In fact, an industry has grown up around researching, iden-
tifying, and fixing them, then deploying the fixes across an organization’s infrastructure.
In their book, 24 Deadly Sins of Software Security,1 Michael Howard, David LeBlanc, and
John Viega categorize the 24 types of programming flaws that create most vulnerabilities. As
shown in the following list, some of the more frequently encountered of these are buffer over-
runs, command injection attacks, and information leakage.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The Web-application vulnerabilities listed previously were discussed in Chapter 8. The
remaining vulnerabilities are discussed in the following sections.
Buffer Overruns Buffer overruns (also called buffer overflows) arise when a program-
mer does not ensure that the quantity of input data fits within the size of the available data
area (buffer). The most innocuous outcomes of exploiting these vulnerabilities are the
program or application crashing, but an attacker can craft instructions that are executed by
the computer when the buffer overflows. Executing these instructions is referred to as arbi-
trary code execution, and this mini-program can insert a backdoor for later access, install
malware, or provide a remote login to an attacker.
Format String Problems Format string vulnerability arises when a software program
asks the user for input, does not validate that input, and then passes the input to a format-
ting function. For example, a contact database program might ask the user to input a phone
number to search, but if the code has a vulnerability in it and the user’s entered phone num-
ber hasn’t yet been validated, an attacker could input memory location, commands, or other
data to control program execution. The classic (yet oversimplified) example involves the
printf command in C:
printf (user_input);
In this example, the user input is not assigned a particular data type by the printf com-
mand, which opens the door to a variety of inputs. The proper form of the command would
restrict input to a string data type, as follows:
printf ("%s", user_input);
Integer Overflows In its broadest sense, the term “integer overflow” refers to a wide
range of arithmetic overflows that occur when a programmer does not restrict data to the
size boundaries of their data types. For example, in Windows, a “short int” data type has a
defined length of 16 bits. An attacker could input a number that caused the arithmetic oper-
ation to overflow the 16 bits used to represent the integer, thus resulting in an integer
overflow.
Integer overflows are more subtle than stack or heap overflows in that they don’t typically
allow an attack to overwrite memory or direct program execution. Instead, the intent is to
store an erroneous value that can be exploited later in the code. However, in cases where the
overflowed integer is allocating a buffer size, the attack could attempt more serious cases of
direct memory manipulation.
C++ Catastrophes These vulnerabilities have to do with intrinsic properties of the C++
programming language. In particular, most of these vulnerabilities rely on uninitialized func-
tion pointers in a class. If an attacker is able to modify the contents of the class—through
initializing, reinitializing, freeing, or double-freeing a pointer—he or she could take control
of program execution. Although this category of vulnerabilities focuses on C++, there are a
number of other object-oriented languages that can be vulnerable.
Catching Exceptions Many languages, applications, and operating systems have standard
error-handling routines. In some cases, the programming team does not implement the error-
handling routine correctly and inadvertently introduces a vulnerability in that portion of the

code. An attacker who has uncovered this vulnerability can cause an error in the program.
Knowing that the program will head to the error-handling routine, the attacker can then inter-
cept the call in order to run his own malicious code.
Command Injection Injection attacks can occur when the programmer does not prop-
erly validate user input, which allows an attacker to include input that, when passed to a
database, can give rise to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Consider this example of a Windows
command script:
echo off
set /p newdir = "Directory to be created:"
mkdir %newdir%
This simple script requests that the user input a directory name and then creates that direc-
tory. However, if a malicious user types mynewdir&cmd at the script’s prompt, the content
beginning with “&” (the command chaining character) opens another command window,
which can be used to execute the command of the attacker’s choice. SQL injection works sim-
ilarly, by appending the attacker’s SQL command(s) to a programmer’s intended user input of
a simple query variable, allowing the attacker to execute SQL commands that are different
than those the developer intended.
A related issue, the failure to validate how user input is handled, can result in vulnerability to
a cross-site scripting attack. This is a type of injection attack in which maliciously formed
scripts are injected into otherwise trusted Web sites. The cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
occurs when the attacker leverages a poorly configured or designed Web-based application so
that it executes a browser-side script within the browser of the Web site visitor. Server-side
applications (including variants of widely used Web servers) can enable these attacks to suc-
ceed. Any Web application that uses user-generated input directly as an output without vali-
dating or encoding it may be susceptible.
The attacker will use the XSS attack to inject a script crafted with malicious intent and ensure
that it is executed by the browser of an unsuspecting user. That end user’s browser will not
suspect the script because it trusts the Web server to deliver trustworthy code. The browser
being attacked will execute the script. Because the script is trusted, the attacker will have full
access to the session tokens, cookies, and any other sensitive data being handled by the
browser or accessible to the browser via the Web site it is visiting. For example, the Web cam-
era or microphone of the client computer may be activated; or, when privileged accounts are
used, the attacker can rewrite HTML content to the server.
Failure to Handle Errors Correctly Similar to problems in error-handling routines,
the failure to handle errors correctly can lead to vulnerabilities in code. Most of the time,
failing to catch an error and recover the program simply leads to a denial of service or a
program crash; however, a crash is an opportunity to exploit the program execution flow.
In 24 Deadly Sins of Software Security, the authors arrange the error-handling mistakes
into the following categories.2
●
Yielding too much information (i.e., giving an attacker enough details to reliably
troubleshoot and further hone an attack)
●
Ignoring errors

●
Misinterpreting errors
●
Using useless return values
●
Using non-error return values
Information Leakage Information leakage is the release of sensitive data outside the
intended organization, either inadvertently through a variety of other vulnerabilities or pur-
posefully by users in the organization. As mentioned in the previous section, there are cases
in which the error message returned for bad input values gives away too much information
about the authentication system. For example, consider this error message:
The password you entered is incorrect. You must use a password that is 6-8
characters long. No numbers or special characters are allowed.
Other cases are more subtle. An example is when a programmer doesn’t realize that the appli-
cation’s owner doesn’t want certain information released. Another example is when the pro-
gram releases information that the programmer didn’t realize would help the attacker carry
out further attacks.
Race Conditions “Race conditions” refers to situations in which two threads, processes,
or applications are able to modify a resource (and therefore interfere with each other) and
the programmer has not taken precautions to ensure that the desired sequence of events
is completed in the proper order. From a security standpoint, an attacker is looking to
exploit the condition whereby a legitimate thread or process is consumed passing a code
check and the malicious code slips by unnoticed.
The 24 Deadly Sins authors mention an example in which an application, when creating a
temporary file, first checks to see if the file already exists. If it does exist, the application uses
the existing file. If not, the application creates a new file. In this scenario, an attacker could
guess the application’s temp file-naming conventions and insert a file with malicious data.
Poor Usability The problem with achieving security in applications is that the process
may not be easy for users. When users find an application—or the secure way of using the
application—difficult to work with, they often find a way to bypass the security features.
Therefore, programmers must make the security measures both effective and easy to use.
Not Updating Easily Before there was auto-updating, most applications and operating
systems required CDs or disks in order to perform an update. And only the most vigilant
users—or those who wanted the latest features—even applied security patches, version
upgrades, or fixes. Microsoft led the way in 2000 by developing an easy-to-use, automated,
and comprehensive updating via the Internet with Automatic Updates.3 Since then, most
developers have updated their applications remotely using a similar type of service. Those
companies who don’t employ easy-to-use updating methods or automatic patch checking or
who don’t allow users to roll back patch problems pay the price with insecure code.
Executing Code with Too Much Privilege Many applications mistakenly require
administrative privileges in order to be installed or run on a system. What’s dangerous
about this is that all software should be assumed to fail someday—and when it fails, that

failure can be exploited by an attacker. To minimize the impact of such a situation occur-
ring, applications should never run with administrative privileges. That way, even if an
application’s vulnerability is exploited, the attacker still has to find a way to elevate his
privileges.
Failure to Protect Stored Data For applications that handle sensitive data, it is
important to protect that data both while it is moving among systems (in transit) and while
it is stored on disk (at rest). When attempting to protect data that’s at rest, here are some
common mistakes:
●
The application relies on a file system that does not have file permissions (e.g., FAT).
●
There are no data access controls, or the data access controls are weak.
●
Permissions to the data are not set properly (e.g., a user is given full read, write, and
execute privileges when read-only would be sufficient).
●
The data is not encrypted, or the algorithm used to encrypt it is weak.
Weaknesses Introduced with Mobile Code Mobile code is code that is down-
loaded and executed on a user’s computer—for example, a Web page that contains an
ActiveX control, Flash application, or Java applet. Vulnerabilities introduced by program-
mers can be exploited, or attackers could trick users into executing malicious mobile code.
To prevent this, browsers must implement strict control over which sites can execute the
code or ensure that the code requires user approval. (This latter control, by allowing users
to decide which mobile code to run, can lead to its own problems.)
Use of Weak Password-Based Systems Passwords are the bane of most security
professionals’ work lives. To avoid cracking, complex passwords are required, but users
tend to hate complex passwords and, therefore, attempt to circumvent the password require-
ments. Software developers have a responsibility as well. The software developed should
require complex password systems. Requirements for a complex password system include
using a salt value (explained in Chapter 3), implementing strong encryption, requiring peri-
odic password changes, and generally implementing a system where guessing a password or
its hash is very difficult.
Weak Random Numbers Although most operating systems have libraries that pro-
vide pseudo-random numbers, these numbers are not truly random. This can be a security
concern, because the strength of the security of encryption, session keys, and other crypto-
graphic functions relies on the use of the degree of randomness of the values used as inputs.
To generate adequately random pseudo-random numbers, programmers should use seed
values and cryptographic libraries that provide the necessary functions.
Using Cryptography Incorrectly A number of cryptographic algorithms and sys-
tems provide powerful protection against data leakage. Unfortunately, application develo-
pers often incorrectly implement the cryptographic functions, or they fail to follow the
proper steps to encrypt data properly. Implementing cryptography requires a rigorous effort
in implementing the function. This class of vulnerabilities covers those software errors that
fail to implement cryptography correctly.

because a network medium is essentially an open channel. Through active network taps and
other attacks, wired networks are just as vulnerable to sniffing as wireless networks. Once
an attacker has access to the medium, he or she can record (and later replay) traffic, modify
it, or hijack a communications session.
Improper Use of PKI, Especially SSL Public-key infrastructures (PKIs) are difficult
to manage. Although the cryptographic algorithms are sound (for now) and the keys are
exchanged effectively, revoking keys, issuing new keys, establishing trust among keys and
providers, and other factors create enough complexity to introduce weaknesses. Addition-
ally, SSL is a powerful method for encrypting data in transit. However, like any security
mechanism, the application developer must implement it correctly in order for it to be
effective.
Trusting Network Name Resolution DNS and its Microsoft cousin, WINS, are
ubiquitous network services. Users only have to remember domain names or system
names, not IP addresses. (This is especially important for the 128-bit long IPv6
addresses!) However, these services were not developed with security in mind; thus, the
information they render can be manipulated by attackers. It is important for developers
to understand that the data provided by network name resolution services can fail and
that it is, therefore, important that applications verify the true communication destina-
tion during execution.
Errors in Configuration or Implementation
It would be easy to blame most of the network vulnerabilities on software developers. We
hear the same story over and over: Developers create software, the software has a bug, and
the bug is exploited for malicious gain by an attacker. What is talked about less often is
how software can be exploited because of the way it is configured or implemented.
As an example, the Apache Software Foundation created one of the most popular Web
servers in use today: Apache HTTP Server. Like any other software product, Apache HTTP
Server has software vulnerabilities, but the security problems most organizations face from
using Apache HTTP Server is the way it is installed and/or configured within the network
environment.
In Apache HTTP Server, the MaxClients configuration directive indicates to the system how
many requests HTTP Server processes concurrently. By default, the value is 256, which
means that the server should be able to handle 256 user requests at a time. The problem is
that HTTP Server creates a new process for every request. If a system is to handle 256 pro-
cesses, it must have the memory capacity to do so. If the server administrator does not get
the hardware configuration correct or does not set the MaxClients value to match the hard-
ware, the admin will cause a denial of service situation with the Web server.
Another configuration problem on HTTP Server installations is that, by default, if the Web
software can access parts of the underlying operating system’s file system through normal
URL mappings, it will. This is referred to as a directory traversal attack and was a very pop-
ular vulnerability to exploit in early versions of various Web server applications.

The Apache Software Foundation offers the following advice in regard to configuration
issues to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities:4
Consider the following example:
# cd /; ln -s / public_html
Accessing http://localhost/~root/
This would allow clients to walk through the entire filesystem. To work around
this, add the following block to your server’s configuration:
<Directory />
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
</Directory>
This will forbid default access to filesystem locations. Add appropriate Directory
blocks to allow access only in those areas you wish. For example,
<Directory /usr/users/*/public_html>
Order Deny,Allow
Allow from all
</Directory>
<Directory /usr/local/httpd>
Order Deny,Allow
Allow from all
</Directory>
The point here is that there are no inherent bugs in the Apache HTTP Server software, at
least in relation to these issues. Instead, security problems are caused because administrators
do not follow Apache’s advice or do not implement the software correctly.
Weaknesses in Processes and Procedures
Although they generate much less buzz than software vulnerabilities, weaknesses in processes
and procedures are just as hazardous, and they are more difficult to detect and fix because
they typically involve the weakest link in security defense: the human element. These “soft”
vulnerabilities often arise when a policy is violated or when the processes and procedures
that implement the policy are inadequate or fail.
For example, consider passwords. Almost all organizations have policies that specify a degree
of password complexity (e.g., the password must be at least eight characters long and include
at least one alphabetic character) as well as a schedule for changing passwords and restric-
tions on how often they can be reused. However, if these policies are not enforced through
the appropriate processes and procedures, the organization is vulnerable to a dictionary
attack on access credentials.
To ensure its security policies are implemented, an organization should hold regular security-
awareness training sessions for its employees as well as contractors and business partners.
However, training by itself is not sufficient and must be supplemented with a regular review
of the policies and their implementation. These reviews have many names, but a common
one is the policy compliance audit.

Audits verify that an organization’s security policies are prudent (cover the right issues) and
are being implemented correctly. For example, to verify the implementation of the password
policy, an auditor would seek evidence that employees are required to change their pass-
words on a regular basis and that the complexity and reuse standards are enforced as part
of that process.
The auditor typically looks at two things: the policy and the evidence that the policy is being
implemented. If the compliance is not documented, you are not in compliance with the
policy.
Security professionals view the process of implementing policy and auditing (verifying) com-
pliance with that policy as integral parts of policy development. Resources on policy and
compliance are offered by the Computer Security Resource Center at the U.S. National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology (http://csrc.nist.gov) and by textbooks such as Manage-
ment of Information Security, by Michael Whitman and Herb Mattord (CENGAGE/Course
Technology).
Finding Vulnerabilities on the Network
The heart of any vulnerability management program is identifying the various vulnerabilities
we’ve outlined. This section discusses various automated tools that perform a wide variety of
network reconnaissance and vulnerability mapping. It also discusses the manual process of
penetration testing.
Scanning and Analysis Tools
To truly assess the risk within a computing environment, you must deploy technical controls
using a strategy of defense in depth, which is likely to include intrusion detection/prevention
systems (IDPS), active vulnerability scanners, passive vulnerability scanners, security informa-
tion and event management (SIEM), and protocol analyzers (commonly referred to as snif-
fers). The IDPS helps to secure networks by detecting intrusions; the scanners and analyzers
help to discover vulnerabilities. More specifically, scanners and analysis tools can find vulner-
abilities in systems, holes in security monitoring coverage, and unsecured aspects of the
network.
Scanner and analysis tools are typically used as part of an attack methodology to collect
information that an attacker would need to launch a successful attack. The attack methodol-
ogy, or attack protocol, is a series of steps or processes used by an attacker, in a logical
sequence, to launch an attack against a target system or network, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Although this approach is more of a pedagogic tool, it offers security testers a roadmap to
follow when scanning the network.
Reconnaisance, fingerprinting, and vulnerability analysis tools are invaluable because they
enable administrators to see what weaknesses the attacker sees. Some of these tools are
extremely complex; others are rather simple. Some are expensive commercial products, but
some of the best scanning and analysis tools were developed by the security research commu-
nity and are available free on the Web. Others have been created by the attack community
and have become widely used.

There is nothing wrong with a security administrator using the tools that potential attackers
use in order to examine network defenses and find areas that require additional attention. In
the military, there is a long and distinguished history of generals inspecting the troops under
their command before battle, walking down the line to inspect the equipment and mental
preparedness of each soldier. In a similar way, the security administrator can use vulnerabil-
ity analysis tools to inspect the units (host computers and network devices) under his or her
command. A word of caution, though: Many of these scanning and analysis tools have dis-
tinct signatures, and some Internet service providers (ISPs) watch for these signatures and
might pull the access privileges of those who use them. Administrators should establish a
working relationship with their ISPs and notify them if planning to scan the external
network.
Reconnaissance One of the preparatory parts of the attack methodology is the collec-
tion of publicly available information about a potential target, a process known as recon-
naissance (often shortened to recon by Americans and to recce by the British). This process
of exploring the Internet presence of a target is sometimes called footprinting. This could
include information on the target’s Web site, contact names and phone numbers, job posts
issued by the target, Internet addresses owned or controlled by a target organization, and
anything else that could provide valuable intelligence on the network, systems, and people
associated with the target.
Target IP Addresses Imagine you’re an attacker and your target is a Web site:
fictitious.com. A great way to start conducting reconnaissance would be to identify the Web
site’s assigned address range, beginning with the IP address of the Web site itself. This is eas-
ily done using the nslookup command (note that these examples are contrived to use
RFC1918 addresses rather than publicly routable addresses):

And its output might be:

would use the ARIN database at http://ws.arin.net/whois.

The most important information for recon purposes is the NetRange, which shows that
ficticious.com has been assigned the addresses 192.168.3.0–192.168.3.255. All publicly
accessible services will be offered on addresses in a valid NetRange, so when you begin the
fingerprinting process, you will look at all those addresses.
Also useful is the name, phone number, and e-mail address of the technical contact. With this
information, you might be able to launch a social-engineering attack on the organization. For
this reason, it is a recommended practice to provide generic information rather than actual
employee names (e.g., network operator, the phone number of the help desk, and an e-mail
address such as netops@ficticious.com).

Target Web Site When attackers move to the next phase of their attack methodology
they often look for more information about their targets. IP address information can be
augmented by browsing the organization’s Web pages because those pages usually contain
information about internal systems, individuals developing Web pages, and other tidbits that
can be used for social-engineering attacks. The View Source command, available on most
popular Web browsers, allows users to see the source code behind the page. Details in this
source code can provide attackers with clues and give them insights into an internal net-
work’s configuration, such as the locations of and directories for Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) scripts and the names or addresses of computers and servers.
Business Research Another source of attack intelligence is the use of business-oriented
Web sites, such as Hoovers, Forbes, Google Finance, and Yahoo! Business. These sites
routinely provide data used for market research as well as more general information about a
company. In doing so, they often reveal information that attackers can use, like: company
mergers (i.e., two companies will be connecting networks), company divestitures (i.e.,
network will be divided), or information on company officers for social-engineering attacks.
Google Hacking Another type of security research is called Google hacking. The idea is to
use the advanced search options provided by Google to locate more and more information
about your target. Although advanced Google searches are not malicious in and of themselves,
attackers are using the search to further their recon efforts. For example, a simple search might
reveal any site that links to a proposed target. By doing more focused research into a company,
however, an attacker can often find additional Internet locations that are not commonly associ-
ated with the company—such as business-to-business (B2B) partners and subsidiaries. Armed
with this information, the attacker can find the weakest link into the target network.
Let’s say Company X has a large datacenter located in Atlanta. The datacenter has been
secured, making it very hard for an attacker to break into it via the Internet. However, the
attacker has run a “link:companyx.com” query on Google and found a small Web server
that links to Company X’s main Web server. After further investigation, the attacker learns
that the small Web server was set up by an administrator at a remote facility, and that the
remote facility has, via its own leased lines, an unrestricted internal link into Company X’s
corporate datacenter. The attacker can now attack the weaker site at the remote facility and
use this compromised network—which is an internal network—to attack the true target. If a
company has a trusted network connection with 15 business partners, one weak business
partner can compromise all 16 networks.
Here are some of the more complicated and elegant Google hacks catalogued on the Google
Hacking Database (GHDB)5 Web site:
●
intitle:index.of.secret, intitle:index.of.private, intitle:index.of.password—returns Web
sites that display indexes of files labeled with sensitive names
●
indexof:cgi-binreturns—Web sites that allow indexing of scripts located in the cgi-bin
directory
●
inurl:j2ee/examples/jsp—returns Web sites that contain sample JavaScript or JSP
scripts that come with the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition application

Fingerprinting After gathering publicly available information, the attacker will often
communicate with the systems on the target network. This is the fingerprinting stage of the
attack methodology, a systematic survey of the target organization’s Internet addresses, con-
ducted to identify the network services offered by the hosts in that range. Using the tools
discussed in the next sections, fingerprinting reveals information about the internal structure
and operational nature of the target system or network.
Sam Spade To assist in the recon process, the attacker will often use an enhanced Web
scanner that, among other things, scans an entire Web site for valuable pieces of information,
such as server names and e-mail addresses. One such scanner is called Sam Spade. The original
developer’s Web site, samspade.org, has not been operational for some time. However, a num-
ber of other Web sites also offer the Sam Spade scanner, such as www.petri.co.il/sam_spade_
tools.htm
and
www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,4709-order,1-page,1/description.html.
A sample screenshot from Sam Spade is shown in Figure 9-2. This scanner can also do a host
of other scans and probes, such as sending multiple ICMP information requests (pings),
attempting to retrieve multiple and cross-zoned DNS queries, and performing network analysis
queries (known, from the commonly used UNIX command for performing the analysis, as tra-
ceroutes). These are all powerful diagnostic and hacking activities. Sam Spade is not, however,
considered hackerware (or hacker-oriented software); rather, it has become recognized as a
utility that happens to be useful to network administrators and miscreants alike.
Wget UNIX or Linux systems support a tool called “wget” that allows a remote individual
to “mirror” entire Web sites. With this tool, attackers can copy an entire Web site and then

go through the source HTML, JavaScript, and Web-based forms at their leisure, collecting
and collating all the data from the source code that will be useful to them for their attacks.
Port Scanners Port-scanning utilities (or port scanners) are tools used by both attackers
and defenders to identify (or fingerprint) the computers that are active on a network as well
as the ports and services active on those computers, the functions and roles the machines are
fulfilling, and other useful information. These tools can scan for specific types of computers,
protocols, or resources, or the scans can be more generalized. You need to understand the
network environment you are using so that you can select the tool most suited to the data
collection task at hand. For instance, if you are trying to identify a Windows computer in a
typical network, a built-in feature of the operating system, nbtstat, may be able to get the
answer you need very quickly, without the installation of a scanner. This tool does not
work on other types of networks, however, so you must know your tools in order to make
the best use of the features of each.
The more specific the scanner is, the more useful the information it provides to attackers and
defenders. However, you should keep a generic, broad-based scanner in your toolbox as well,
to help locate and identify rogue nodes on the network that administrators may be unaware
of. Probably the most popular port scanner is Nmap, which runs on both UNIX and Win-
dows systems. You can find out more about Nmap at http://nmap.org. As of 2007, Nmap
includes the Zenmap GUI front end,6 which simplifies the use of the tool.
A port is a network channel or connection point in a data communications system. Within
TCP/IP, TCP, and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), port numbers differentiate the multiple
communication channels that are used to connect to the network services being offered on
the same network device. Each application within TCP/IP has a unique port number. Some
have default ports but can also use other ports. Some of the well-known TCP port numbers
are presented in Table 9-1. In all, there are 65,536 port numbers in use for TCP and another
65,536 port numbers for UDP. Services using the TCP/IP protocol can run on any port; how-
ever, the services with reserved ports (also called well-known ports) generally run on ports
1–1023. Port 0 is not used. Ports greater than 1023 are typically referred to as ephemeral
ports and may be randomly allocated to server and client processes.
Why should you secure open ports? Because an open port is an open door and can be used
by an attacker to send commands to a computer, potentially gain access to a server, and pos-
sibly exert control over a networking device. The general rule is to remove from service or at
least secure any port not absolutely necessary to conducting business. For example, if a busi-
ness doesn’t host Web services, there is no need for port 80 to be available on its servers.
Firewall Analysis Tools Understanding exactly where an organization’s firewall is located
and what the existing rule sets on the firewall do are very important steps for an attacker or
any security administrator. There are several tools that automate the remote discovery of fire-
wall rules and assist the administrator (or the attacker) in analyzing the rules to determine
exactly what they allow and what they reject.
The Nmap tool mentioned earlier has some advanced options that are useful for firewall
analysis. The Nmap option called “Idle scanning” (which is run with the -sI switch) allows
you to bounce your scan across a firewall by using one of the idle DMZ hosts as the initiator

of the scan. More specifically, given that most operating systems do not use truly random
IP packet identification numbers (IP IDs), if there is more than one host in the DMZ and
one host uses nonrandom IP IDs, then the attacker can query the server (server X) and obtain
the currently used IP ID as well as the known algorithm for incrementing the IP IDs. The
attacker can then spoof a packet that is allegedly from server X and destined for an internal
IP address behind the firewall. If the port is open on the internal machine, the internal
machine replies to server X with a SYN-ACK packet, which forces server X to respond with
a TCP RESET packet. In responding with the TCP RESET, server X increments its IP ID
number. The attacker can now query server X a second time to see if the IP ID has incremen-
ted. If it has, the attacker knows that the internal machine is alive and that the internal
machine has the queried service port open. In a nutshell, running the Nmap Idle scan allows
an attacker to scan an internal network as if he or she were physically located on a trusted
machine inside the DMZ.
Another tool that can be used to analyze firewalls is Firewalk. Written by noted author and
network security expert Mike Schiffman with David Goldsmith,7 Firewalk uses incrementing
Time-to-Live (TTL) packets to determine the path into a network as well as the default fire-
wall policy. Running Firewalk against a target machine reveals where routers and firewalls
are filtering traffic to the target host. More information on Firewalk can be obtained from
http://packetstormsecurity.org/UNIX/audit/firewalk/.
Another firewall analysis tool is hping, which is a modified ping client. It supports multiple
protocols, and you can use a command line to specify nearly any of the ping parameters.
For instance, you can use hping with modified TTL values to determine the infrastructure of
a DMZ. You can use hping with specific ICMP flags in order to bypass poorly configured

firewalls (i.e., firewalls that allow all ICMP traffic to pass through) and find internal systems.
You can find hping at www.hping.org.
Administrators who are wary of using the same tools that attackers use should remember
two important points: (1) Regardless of the nature of the tool used to validate or analyze a
firewall’s configuration, it is the intent of the user that dictates how the information gathered
will be used, and (2) In order to defend a computer or network, it is necessary to understand
the ways it can be attacked. Thus, a tool that can help close up an open or poorly configured
firewall helps the network defender minimize the risk from attack.
Operating System Detection Tools Identifying vulnerabilities on a target computer is
much easier once an attacker knows the operating system. As a system administrator or secu-
rity tester, the same logic holds true. Once the OS is known, it is easy to determine all the
vulnerabilities to which it is susceptible. There are many tools that use networking protocols
to determine a remote computer’s OS. One such tool is XProbe2, which uses ICMP to deter-
mine the remote OS. This tool can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/xprobe/.
XProbe2 sends a lot of different ICMP queries against the target host. As reply packets are
received, XProbe2 matches these responses from the target’s TCP/IP stack with its own inter-
nal database of known responses. Because most OSs have a unique way of responding to
ICMP requests, Xprobe2 is able to find matches and thus detect the operating systems of
remote computers. System and network administrators should take note of this and restrict
the use of ICMP through their organization’s firewalls and (when possible) within their orga-
nization’s internal networks.
The port scanner Nmap, described earlier, also includes a version detection engine, which
attempts to identify the operating system version and version information for any running
services, as shown in Figure 9-3.

Wireless Security Tools 802.11 wireless networks exist as subnets on nearly all large
networks. A wireless connection, though convenient, has many potential security holes. An
organization that spends all its time securing the wired network while neglecting its wireless
networks is opening itself up for a security breach. As a security professional, you must
assess the risk of wireless networks. The wireless security toolkit you choose should include
the ability to sniff wireless traffic, scan wireless hosts, and assess the level of privacy or confi-
dentiality afforded on the wireless network.
There are several tools that apply packet sniffing to wireless networks, including NetStumbler,
which is offered as freeware and can be found at www.netstumbler.org. (For Windows Vista
and Windows 7 support, a similar tool, called Vistumbler, is available at www.vistumbler.net.)
Figure 9-4 shows NetStumbler running on a Windows XP machine. Another wireless tool is
AirSnare, also free, which can be run on a low-end wireless workstation. AirSnare monitors
the airwaves for any new devices or access points. When it finds one, it sounds an alarm alerting
the administrators that a new, potentially dangerous wireless apparatus is attempting access on
a closed wireless network. Figure 9-5 shows AirSnare in action.
Finally, Aircrack-ng (http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php) is a tool designed to crack WEP
and WPA-PSK keys to allow packet sniffing and wireless network auditing.
Vulnerability Scanners Vulnerability scanners are tools designed to identify known sys-
tem vulnerabilities. They fall into three types: active, passive, and fuzzers. Active scanners
produce network traffic to actively probe systems for vulnerabilities. Passive scanners listen
to network traffic to analyze traffic for vulnerabilities. Fuzzers produce a variety of user

Active Vulnerability Scanners An active vulnerability scanner initiates traffic on the
network in order to identify security holes. In doing so, it exposes usernames and groups,
open network shares, and configuration problems as well as other vulnerabilities in servers.
An example of a vulnerability scanner is GFI LanGuard, which is available as a 30-day eval-
uation download, then requires a paid registration. Another vulnerability scanner is Nessus, a
professional freeware utility that uses IP packets to identify available hosts, the services
(ports) each host is offering, the operating system and OS version they are running, the type
of packet filters and firewalls in use, and dozens of other network characteristics. Figures 9-6
and 9-7 show sample LanGuard and Nessus result screens.
Passive Vulnerability Scanners A passive vulnerability scanner listens in on the network
and identifies vulnerable versions of both server and client software. There are currently two
primary vendors offering this type of scanning solution: Tenable Network Security, which
offers a product called Passive Vulnerability Scanner, and Sourcefire, which offers a product
called RNA. Passive scanners are advantageous in that they do not require vulnerability ana-
lysts to get prior approval for testing. They simply monitor the network connections to and
from a server to obtain a list of vulnerable applications. Furthermore, passive vulnerability
scanners can find client-side vulnerabilities that are typically not found by active scanners.
For instance, an active scanner operating without Windows Domain Admin rights would be
unable to determine the version of Internet Explorer running on a desktop machine, but a
passive scanner can observe the traffic to and from the client to make that determination.

Fuzzers Vulnerability scanners are proficient at finding known, documented holes, but
what happens if the Web server is from a new vendor, or if the application was developed
by an internal development team? That’s where a class of vulnerability scanners called
black-box scanners, or fuzzers, comes in. Fuzz testing, also known as “fuzzing,” is a straight-
forward technique that looks for vulnerabilities in a program or protocol by feeding random
input into the program or the network running the protocol. Vulnerabilities can be detected
by measuring the outcome of the random inputs.
Examples of fuzzers are shown in Table 9-3.10 For a list of protocol-specific and other
fuzz-testing tools, go to http://blogold.chinaunix.net/u2/69926/showart_706962.html.
One fuzz scanner, SPIKE, has two primary components. The first is the SPIKE Proxy, a full-
blown proxy server. As Web site visitors use the proxy, SPIKE builds a database of each of
the traversed pages, forms, and other Web-specific information. When the Web site’s owner
determines that enough history has been collected to fully characterize the Web sites, SPIKE
can check the Web site for bugs—that is, administrators can use the usage history collected
by SPIKE to traverse all known pages, forms, active programs (e.g., asp, cgi-bin) and can
test the system by attempting overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and many other
classes of Web attacks.

SPIKE can fuzz any protocol that utilizes TCP/IP. By sniffing a session and building a SPIKE
script, or building a full-blown C program using the SPIKE API, a user can simulate and fuzz
nearly any protocol. Figure 9-8 shows a sample SPIKE script being prepared to fuzz the
ISAKMP protocol (which is used by VPNs). Figure 9-9 shows the SPIKE program generic_
send_udp fuzzing an IKE server using the SPIKE script. As you can see, SPIKE can be used
to quickly fuzz and find weaknesses in nearly any protocol.
Penetration Once an attacker has gained the necessary intelligence on the target, he can
start penetrating the network. Typically, this is accomplished through a type of manual test-
ing called penetration testing (more on that shortly). However, there are also tools that
automatically attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on a system.

use them are not likely to employ the most aggressive modes on their own production
networks.
There is a class of scanners that actually exploit the remote machine and allow the vulnerability
analyst (sometimes called a penetration tester) to create an account, modify a Web page, or view
data. These tools can be very dangerous and should be used only when absolutely necessary. This
is usually when the applications or systems can be isolated in a test environment. Examples of
testing tools include Core Impact, Immunity’s CANVAS, and the Metasploit Framework.
Of these three, only the Metasploit Framework is available without a license fee (see www.
metasploit.com). The Metasploit Framework is a collection of exploits coupled with an interface
that allows you to customize exploitation of vulnerable systems. For instance, you can custom-
ize the overflow to exploit a Microsoft Exchange server and enable the specific attack script to
insert a unique command (perhaps to create a new user and add that user to the administrators
group). See Figure 9-10 for a screenshot of the Metasploit Framework in action.
Tools can also be combined to form a quite effective penetration solution. For example,
Nmap can identify open network ports and make a good guess as to the software versions
running on the servers. This information can then be used with the Metasploit Framework to
run all available exploits for that software and version. In Figure 9-11, this operation is shown
as the “hack-o-matic.” For this technique to succeed, there only has to be one server accessible
to the attacker somewhere in the infrastructure.
Exploitation When considered as part of the attack methodology, “exploitation” refers
to the tools and techniques for breaking into more systems, gaining further network access,
or gaining access to more resources. Other than netcat (see the next section), there are fewer
legitimate security tools that fall into this category; however, sniffers can be incredibly

powerful in gaining further access to networks during an attack or helping administrators
detect further vulnerabilities.
Netcat Once the remote system has been subverted, many attackers use FTP, TFTP, and
similar types of file transfer utilities to store the necessary attack tools in a data cache. These
tools can then be transferred to other servers within the target environment and used later.
One of the most useful utilities to accomplish this type of file transfer is netcat. Netcat is a
full client and server environment that allows the transfer of data between netcat
installations.
However, netcat also does a lot more: it can be used as a remote shell utility to allow control
of a remote system, as shown in Figure 9-12. With this feature, attackers and testers alike can
use netcat as a backdoor to allow future access to the exploited system. Netcat can also grab
Web banners—and it can act as a port scanner. This tool offers a cornucopia of security test-
ing features.
• Port scan to identify open ports
• Fingerprint services to identify versions
• Targeted Metasploit attacks against those services

Packet Sniffers A packet sniffer (sometimes called a network protocol analyzer) is a net-
work tool that collects copies of packets from the network and analyzes them or stores the
packets for later analysis. As such, it can provide a network administrator with valuable
information for diagnosing and resolving networking issues. In the wrong hands, however, a
sniffer can be used to eavesdrop on network traffic.
Many administrators feel that they are safe from sniffer attacks when their computing envi-
ronment is primarily a switched network environment. This couldn’t be farther from the
truth. There are a number of open-source sniffers that support alternative networking
approaches that can, in turn, enable packet sniffing in a switched network environment.
Two of these alternative networking approaches are ARP-spoofing and session hijacking,
both of which use man-in-the-middle tools like ettercap. To secure data that’s in transit
across any network, organizations must use encryption.
Typically, to use these types of programs most effectively, the user must be connected to a
network from a central location. Simply tapping into an Internet connection floods you with
more data than can be readily processed and, technically, constitutes a violation of the Wire-
tap Act. In order to comply with legal requirements, an administrator using a packet sniffer
must: (1) be on a network that the organization owns, (2) be under direct authorization of
the owners of the network, and (3) have knowledge and consent of the content creators. If
all three conditions are met, the administrator can selectively collect and analyze packets to
identify and diagnose problems on the network. The first two conditions are self-
explanatory. The third, consent, is usually handled by having all system users sign a release
when they are issued a user ID and passwords. Incidentally, these three conditions are the
same requirements for monitoring employee activities on the network. Unless consent from
all users of a network has been acquired, packet sniffing should be construed as a form of
employee monitoring.
There are both commercial and open-source sniffers. A free, client-based network protocol
analyzer that happens to be free is Wireshark (www.wireshark.com), known as Ethereal
until a trademark battle in 2006. Wireshark allows the administrator to examine data from
both live network traffic and captured traffic. It also has several other features, including a
language filter and a TCP session reconstruction utility. Figure 9-13 shows a sample screen
from Wireshark.
Table 9-4 provides a list of the Top 10 Packet sniffers—again, according to survey results
from the security community.
Return When considered as part of the attack methodology, “return” refers to actions an
attacker takes to ensure she is able to return to the target unobstructed. This could entail
installing backdoors, installing bots, creating user accounts, or other actions. There are no
legitimate security tools administrators can use to mimic this stage, nor are such tools neces-
sary. If the team can stop the attack in the first place, there will be no return.
Penetration Testing
Many organizations use a specialized service called a penetration test to assess their security
posture on a regular basis. A penetration test uses all the techniques and tools available to
an attacker in an attempt to compromise or penetrate an organization’s defenses.

Penetration tests can be performed in a variety of ways and with different scopes. For example,
the organization might only wish to assess the quality of its network defenses and would,
therefore, limit the scope of the test to its externally accessible network resources (Web sites, e-
commerce sites, wireless networking infrastructure, etc.). For a more complete assessment, the
scope may include all the organization’s defenses, including physical security.

The scope will depend on the goal of the test—for example, whether the compromise will
stop at identifying an exploitable vulnerability or whether the exploit should actually be car-
ried out. There are advantages and disadvantages to either decision. For example, stopping at
the identification phase has minimal impact on the organization, whereas carrying out a full
exploit exercises the organization’s incident detection and response plans.
Penetration testing can be performed by an internal group (so-called “red teams”) or out-
sourced. Needless to say, when a penetration (or pen) test is outsourced, the agreement must
carefully specify the scope and limitations of the test and ensure absolute confidentiality of
the results.
One variable of the penetration test, whether it’s performed internally or outsourced, is the
amount of information provided to the red team. There are three categories of testing:
●
Black box—The red team is given no information about the organization and
approaches the organization as an external attacker. Although this is the most realistic
type of test, it also requires the most work on the part of the red team and is, there-
fore, the most expensive. This is also the most difficult type of test for an organization
to do internally, as its employees cannot really approach the organization as if they
knew nothing about it.
●
Gray box—The red team is given some general information about the organization,
such as its general network architecture, its network address ranges, and the software
versions it uses. This reduces the level of effort for the red team and reduces the cost
of the exercise.
●
White box—The red team is given full information about the organization and its
structure, including detailed network maps, software documentation, details on alarm
systems, and the like. This type of test is perhaps easiest to perform and can serve the
very useful purpose of verifying that the controls in place are actually installed and
operating correctly and, most importantly, do what they are supposed to.
The tools used in a penetration test are the same tools security professionals use to defend the
organization (a fine example of dual-use technology). Whereas a defender uses the tools to
identify potential weaknesses that can be remediated, the red team uses them as an attacker
would, to identify portals and methods of entry.
Remember that not all attacks against an organization’s assets are technical attacks. For
example, an attacker, using the domain registration information for ficticious.com, could
call the organization’s help desk and claim he was the network’s technical contact, then
have the organization’s password reset.
Recommended Vulnerability Assessment Methodology
Now that you understand the tools involved in conducting a vulnerability assessment, it’s
time to put them all together. An excellent reference in this area is the NIST Special Publica-
tion 800-115, which recommends using the set of review techniques shown in Table 9-5 and
the Baseline reviewer skills shown in Table 9-6. Together, these provide a systematic
approach to identifying and validating vulnerabilities in systems and networks.
Evaluating and validating vulnerabilities in an organization’s systems falls into three stages,
each stage including multiple steps:14

Addressing Vulnerabilities
Understanding risks posed by a software vulnerability starts with the disclosure of the vulner-
ability by security researchers or by the software vendor. From there, the vulnerability assess-
ment tools can start to look for the vulnerabilities and notify organizations when they exist.
Once a system vulnerability has been discovered, either through testing or through being noti-
fied by the software vendor, the risk posed by the vulnerability must be assessed. After all, if
there is minimal risk, there’s no reason to do anything. In general, though, there are three
ways to address a vulnerability:
●
Fix it (e.g., apply a software patch)
●
Mitigate it (e.g., provide IDPS to stop applicable attacks)
●
Ignore it
●
Remove the system, service, or process

Vulnerability Disclosure
Organizations must stay informed of vulnerabilities in the software products they deploy.
There are two general sources of this type of information: software vendors and security
researchers. These two sources employ very different philosophies on the kind of informa-
tion that is shared with the general public. Vendors tend to take a long time to fix a
vulnerability—if they admit the vulnerability exists at all, that is. (There’s no additional
revenue to be gained by diverting resources to fixing bugs.) However, most security researchers
believe that everyone needs to know about vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered. The
idea is that, if attackers know about a vulnerability, so should administrators.
There are three philosophical approaches to handling the disclosure of vulnerabilities that
encompass the views of both groups:
●
Full disclosure—Announce to the public immediately upon discovery.
●
Delayed disclosure—Disclose only after a fix is available.
●
Responsible disclosure—Report the vulnerability to the vendor. Allow the vendor time
to develop a fix. If too much time passes, report the vulnerability to the public.
The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches have been hotly debated since the
early-1990s.15 Well-known security experts such as Bruce Schneier advocate full disclosure16
because it is likely that attackers already know about the vulnerabilities and public disclosure
encourages vendors to provide fixes in a timely fashion, but others maintain that publicly dis-
closing the vulnerability only encourages the production of automated attack tools that
“script kiddies” can use to mount attacks.
A successful example of a delayed disclosure was the Sendmail vulnerability that was discov-
ered in 2003.17 This vulnerability was quietly communicated to the affected vendors and only
publicly disclosed when a fix was available. In fact, the first public exploit of the vulnerabil-
ity appeared the day after its existence became public.
Full-disclosure adherents are quick to point out that there is really no way to ensure that a
vulnerability has not been discovered in the hacker underground and that there are often
measures that can prevent a successful exploit in advance of the fix.
A complicating factor is that the person who discovers a vulnerability is the one who decides
whom to tell. Although many security researchers follow the “responsible disclosure”
approach of communicating the vulnerability to the affected vendor and withholding public
disclosure until a vendor fix is released (or a reasonable amount of time has passed), others
may immediately disclose the vulnerability to the hacker underground, on public Web sites,
or via full-disclosure mailing lists.
This debate shows no sign of resolving; wise security professionals carefully monitor both
vendor security announcements and the full-disclosure mailing lists.
How can security professionals remain informed of all the vulnerabilities that are out there?
First, they should know the following:
●
Their organization’s security policies—A vulnerability is not necessarily a cause for
concern. The danger arises from the damage that the vulnerability, if exploited, could
cause. Consider a Web server with a known vulnerability that operates only on a
protected network and that provides data of limited value. That might not need to be

dealt with, but if that same vulnerability existed on an Internet-exposed e-commerce
server, it would be essential to repair it immediately.
●
What software and hardware devices the organization uses—If the organization does
not use a vulnerable piece of software, then the risk is minimal. If a new vulnerability
for Microsoft Internet Information Server is announced, this is of little concern to a
company that uses only Apache Web servers.
Information security professionals should regularly consult the following types of public-
disclosure lists:
●
Vendor announcements
●
Full-disclosure mailing lists
●
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database (CVE List) maintained by Mitre
Corporation
●
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) sponsored by the Department of Home-
land Security18
Vendor Announcements Most of the major vendors maintain mailing lists to
announce vulnerabilities, fixes, or any compensating actions that can be taken (e.g., closing
the network port associated with a vulnerable network service or disabling script execution
in a vulnerable Web browser). Figure 9-14 shows a Microsoft security bulletin summary for
January, 2011.19 Figure 9-15 shows the exploitation index associated with the vulnerabil-
ities mentioned in Figure 9-14. Figure 9-16 shows the Windows operating systems and com-
ponents affected by these vulnerabilities.
Security professionals should subscribe to the relevant vendor mailing lists and conduct risk
assessments on each new announcement to determine the appropriate actions to be taken.
Full-Disclosure Lists Vendors tend to delay announcing vulnerabilities until they’ve
had time to research them and develop a fix or identify compensating actions, which can
create a “window of vulnerability”20 for organizations if the problem has been discovered
elsewhere or disclosed to others.
The hacker community and some security researchers release details of vulnerabilities as soon
as they are discovered on Web sites, blogs, IRC channels, chat rooms, or full-disclosure mail-
ing lists such as Bugtraq or Full-Disclosure.
The Bugtraq mailing list is a widely known, major source of public vulnerability announce-
ments. As a founding member of the “full disclosure” movement, Bugtraq disseminates vul-
nerability information as soon as it is discovered, regardless of whether vendors have been
notified or a fix is available. Bugtraq has been alternately praised for improving software
quality (by focusing public attention on the prevalence of security flaws) and castigated for
informing potential attackers of methods for compromising systems.
A sample Bugtraq posting is shown in Figure 9-17.21

threats, assessments of their severity, and advice on how to counter them. Perhaps the most
useful feature of the site is the “handler’s diary,” a daily log written by volunteer intrusion
analysts who staff the storm center. The handler’s diary is available as an RSS feed
(http://isc.sans.edu/xml.html), which includes the ability for forwarding the entries to
a pager.
Because it accepts firewall and intrusion logs from many sources, the ISC is often one of the
first organizations to spot network anomalies, and it often traces them to specific malware or
vulnerability exploits. For example, an advisory issued on January 20, 2011 described a possi-
ble new Twitter worm, as shown in Figure 9-18.
First The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is another organization
that facilitates information sharing on the latest cyber-threats and attacks. On its Web site
(www.first.org), the organization describes its mission this way:
FIRST brings together a variety of computer security incident response teams
from government, in incident prevention, to stimulate rapid reaction to incidents,
and to promote information sharing among members and the community at
large.22

The CVE List @ Mitre Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is “a dictionary
of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.”23 In addition to
announcing vulnerabilities, the CVE List (http://cve.mitre.org) assigns unique identifiers to
individual vulnerabilities. Thus, if two Microsoft Word buffer overflow vulnerabilities were
announced at the same time or a Linux kernel overflow prompted the creation of fixes by
Debian and Red Hat, the CVE identifiers would help security professionals distinguish
among the vulnerabilities and their fixes.
The NVD The National Vulnerability Database (http://nvd.nist.gov/) is the U.S. govern-
mental repository of vulnerabilities, which includes CVE identifiers and alerts from the US-
CERT on current threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities. The NVD allows searches in either
direction (from CVE reference numbers to NVD reference numbers and vice versa).
NVD employs the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) to allow vulnerabil-
ity information queries. According to the introduction to OVAL at oval.mitre.org, OVAL pro-
vides a common language “to encode system details and an assortment of content repositories
held throughout the community. Tools and services that use OVAL for the three steps of sys-
tem assessment—representing system information, expressing specific machine states, and
reporting the results of an assessment—provide enterprises with accurate, consistent, and
actionable information so they may improve their security. Use of OVAL also provides for
reliable and reproducible information assurance metrics and enables interoperability and auto-
mation among security tools and services.”24
OVAL can collect data directly from systems using XHTML and report it directly to the
OVAL database.
US-CERT The United States Computer Emergency Response Team (www.us-cert.gov) is a
centralized collection and reporting facility that focuses on the tracking and dissemination of
information about current computer security threats. A US-CERT National Cyber Alert,
which corresponds to the Microsoft Alerts illustrated in Figures 9-14 to 9-16, is shown in
Figure 9-19.
According to the frequently asked questions at the US-CERT’s Web site:
The National Cyber Alert System is America’s first cohesive national cyber secu-
rity system for identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing emerging vulnerabilities
and threats. Managed by the US-CERT, the system relays computer security
update and warning information to all users. It provides all citizens—from com-
puter security professionals to home computer users with basic skills—with free,
timely, actionable information to better secure their computer systems. The
National Cyber Alert System provides valuable cyber security information in the
form of Technical Cyber Security Alerts, Cyber Security Alerts, Cyber Security
Tips, and Cyber Security Bulletins.25
US-CERT also maintains several mailing lists to allow individual information security profes-
sionals, organizations, and government institutions to receive periodic and emergency updates.
ISACs The U.S. government’s plan to protect the country’s critical infrastructure relies
heavily on the US-CERT. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, critical
infrastructure are “the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital

to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect
on security, national economic security, public health or safety, or any combination
thereof.”26 However, another critical component is reaching out to key industries to collect
and provide information about the latest cyber-threats. Many of these industry groups have
Information Security and Analysis Centers (ISACs) to help provide these operational capa-
bilities. For example, the IT and Telecom industry sectors have the IT-ISAC to provide this
type of threat information to its member organizations.
Here is a description of IT-ISAC taken from its Web site (www.it-isac.org):
Founded in 2000 and achieving operational capability in 2001, the Information
Technology - Information Sharing and Analysis Center (IT-ISAC) is a non-
profit, limited liability corporation formed by members within the Information
Technology sector as a unique and specialized forum for managing risks to their
corporations and the IT infrastructure. Members participate in national and
homeland security efforts to strengthen the IT infrastructure through cyber infor-
mation sharing and analysis. As a result, members help their companies improve
their incident response through trusted collaboration, analysis, coordination, and
drive decision-making by policy makers on cybersecurity, incident response, and
information sharing issues.27

Vulnerability Risk Assessment
Once an organization knows about vulnerabilities, it must assess the risks they pose. Keep in
mind that, although each vulnerability poses some risk, the remediation effort must be in
proportion to the assessed risk.
Vendors commonly assign priorities to their fixes. For example, a fix for a vulnerability that
poses a significant risk that an attacker will take control of a system and already has publicly
available exploit code, may be rated “critical.” Less dangerous vulnerabilities may receive a
fix priority rating of “recommended.”
The problem is one of consistency. One vendor may rate its most dangerous vulnerabilities as
“critical” while another rates them as “high.” On top of that, each vendor may use different
criteria to determine the criticality of the vulnerabilities. To address this problem, FIRST cre-
ated the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
CVSS Here is a brief overview of CVSS taken from the FIRST Web site:
CVSS is a vulnerability scoring system designed to provide an open and stan-
dardized method for rating IT vulnerabilities. CVSS helps organizations prioritize
and coordinate a joint response to security vulnerabilities by communicating the
base, temporal and environmental properties of a vulnerability. For additional
information on CVSS v2, please see www.first.org/cvss and http://nvd.nist.gov/
cvss.cfm?version=2.28
CVSS consists of three groups of metrics: base, temporal, and environmental. These cascade
down from one to the next to come up with an overall vulnerability score for a particular
organization, as shown in Figure 9-20.
Base Score Generally speaking, software vendors (who participate in using the CVSS
metrics) set the Base Score, which does not change. This score focuses on the characteristics
of the vulnerability itself. Here are the factors that contribute to the Base Score:29
●
Access vector—Measures the ability of the attacker to reach a target system with this
vulnerability. Does the attacker need to be on the local network (e.g., SMB is gener-
ally only routed on internal networks)? Can she be on a connecting network? Or can
she exploit the vulnerability over the Internet?
●
Access complexity—Measures the difficulty level of exploiting the vulnerability.
●
Authentication—Measures the number of times the attacker must successfully authen-
ticate himself in order to exploit the vulnerability. The worst case is none.
●
Confidentiality impact—Measures the extent to which the attacker can access unau-
thorized information as a result of exploiting the vulnerability.
●
Integrity impact—Measures the extent to which the attacker can modify data on the
target system as a result of exploiting the vulnerability.
●
Availability impact—Measures the extent to which the attacker can prevent the avail-
ability of the information resources as a result of exploiting the vulnerability.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Temporal Score The Temporal Score is also set by the software vendor but changes over
time once exploits are discovered, fixes are released, or more reliable threat intelligence is
received. Here are the factors that contribute to the Temporal Score:30
●
Exploitability—Measures the availability of proven, reliable exploit code, simple
proof-of-concept code, or whether any known exploits exist.
●
Remediation level—Measures whether an official patch is available, only a temporary
fix is available, a workaround exists, or there are no current fixes.
●
Report confidence—Measures the reliability of the vulnerability report. Was it con-
firmed by the vendor? Is it a rumor on a mailing list? Is the source credible?
Environmental Score The Environmental Score is set by the organization using the soft-
ware. This represents the overall score for the vulnerability, taking into account unique factors
of the IT environment. Here are the factors that contribute to the Environmental Score:31

●
Collateral damage potential—Measures loss of lives, physical assets, or financial well-
being from the successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
●
Target distribution—Measures the percentage of systems that could be affected by this
vulnerability.
●
Security requirements—The subjective analysis of the local security team to determine
which aspect—confidentiality, integrity, or availability—would be most affected if the
vulnerability is exploited.
Other Factors Additional factors that must be taken into account when conducting a
risk assessment for a vulnerability include:
●
Exposure—How susceptible is the organization to an exploit of the vulnerability?
A critical defect in an Internet-facing router or firewall leads to much more exposure
than one in a Web server that is only accessible from within the organization.
●
Criticality of the affected assets—Patches are produced by the same developers who
introduced the problem in the first place; therefore, the patches must be tested to
ensure that they do not have undesirable side effects when installed. Loss of access
to a critical asset is equally disruptive to an organization, whether the cause is a
malicious attack or a bad software patch.
●
Compensating factors—There may be other ways to prevent the vulnerability from
being exploited before the fix can be tested and installed. For example, it might be
possible to close the network port associated with a vulnerable network service or
disable script execution in a vulnerable Web browser.
●
Downtime requirements—Many patch installations require the server to be rebooted
during installation. This restart will impact the availability of the services hosted by
the server and may require special scheduling, failover to alternate servers, or other
accommodations.
A risk assessment takes all these factors into account to determine what percentage of an
organization’s scarce IT resources should be dedicated to the deploying of a fix.
Chapter Summary
■
To maintain secure networks, information security professionals must be prepared to
systematically identify system vulnerabilities. This is often done by performing self-
assessment using scanning and penetration testing.
■
Many vulnerabilities have common underlying causes that stem from frequently
encountered errors or shortcomings that developers create or overlook when deploy-
ing networks or systems.
■
Common vulnerabilities fall into two broad classes: defects in software or firmware,
and weaknesses in processes and procedures, which typically involve the weakest link
in security defenses, the human element.
■
To keep informed of emerging vulnerabilities, information security professionals
should regularly consult vendor announcements, full-disclosure mailing lists, and

CVE, which is the common vulnerabilities and exposures database maintained by
Mitre Corporation for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
■
To assess the risk within a computing environment, network professionals must use
tools such as intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS), active vulnerability scan-
ners, passive vulnerability scanners, automated log analyzers, and protocol analyzers,
commonly referred to as sniffers.
■
Many organizations use a service called a penetration test to assess their security pos-
tures on a regular basis. A penetration test team, called a red team, uses all the tech-
niques and tools available to attackers in order to attempt to compromise or penetrate
an organization’s defenses.

Hands-On Projects
Project 9-1
For this project, you will need to download and set up the BackTrack suite
of tools to run in a virtual environment. The ISO can be located at www.
backtrack-linux.org/downloads/. Download and set up the appropriate ISO
for your environment, then create a virtual image using the VM software package of your
choice. Finally, we will need a “victim” system that we can scan against. There are numer-
ous preconfigured virtual systems available for download that are designed to be used for
just this type of exercise. For demonstration purposes, we have chosen to use the Metasploi-
table virtual system. Metasploitable is available for torrent download at http://updates.
metasploit.com/data/Metasploitable.zip.torrent. IMPORTANT: You MUST have permission
from the network owner to engage in this exercise. We will use Zenmap, an Nmap GUI that
comes pre-installed on the BackTrack ISO.
1. Start the Metasploitable virtual system.
2. On the BackTrack system, start Zenmap by clicking the graphic in the lower-left side of
the taskbar that looks like a dragon, then choosing BackTrack -> Information Gathering ->
Network Analysis -> Network Scanners -> zenmap, as shown in Figure 9-21.
3. Enter the IP address of the Metasploitable system in the Target field.
4. Choose Quick Scan in the Profile field. Notice the Command field shows the actual
command-line options you would type if you were not using the GUI.

5. Click Scan to begin the scan.
6. After the scan completes, Zenmap returns results, as shown in Figure 9-22.
These results show a system that has several open ports. However, the results are vague
and not helpful in assessing potential vulnerabilities. We need to use additional options
to get deeper details about the system.
7. In the Command field, manually add -O as an option, before the IP address, then click
Scan. This option enables the Nmap operating system feature.
8. After the scan completes, Zenmap returns results. Scroll down to the bottom of the
screen, and you will now see details regarding the operating system. This information
can be used to help research vulnerabilities for the “victim” system. Your output should
look similar to what is shown in Figure 9-23.
Having details about the operating system is an important step in conducting a vulnera-
bility analysis. However, having details about the individual applications that actually
answer requests on the open ports is important as well. To collect details about the
installed applications, we will have to use yet another option.
9. In the Command field, remove the -O option and replace it with -sV, then click Scan.
This option enables the Nmap service scanning feature.
10. After the scan completes, Zenmap returns results. Click the Ports/Hosts tab and review
the results. As you see, you now have details regarding the application and version
level operating on the “victim” system. This information can be used to help research
vulnerabilities related to the “victim” system. Your output should look similar to what
is shown in Figure 9-24.

Introduction
Auditing is a term used frequently in business and IT. It has a number of meanings, but the
dominant information security and business definition states that auditing is a review of orga-
nizational processes for compliance to policies, standards, or regulations. This is often viewed
by those being examined as an unpleasant event, with overtones of fear and dread. In this
book, we focus on two additional meanings. First, audit is a procedure for recording and
reviewing the variety of events that occur on a network or systems. Second, audit is a periodic
self-review of a network environment required to safely operate any complex organization.
The first of our definitions is probably better termed systems monitoring, which refers to the
continual self-examination of a system or a network of systems operations. This would
encompass the use of its applications and the actions of those who access and use those
systems. Thus, formally speaking, systems monitoring is the ongoing review of a system or
network of systems to determine if the operational results and events are within the bounds
established as proper functioning. This will include processes to detect potential incidents and
ensure compliance with systems policies.
EBS had come a long way in its preparation for the upcoming PCI audit. One area yet
to be addressed was monitoring systems for security-related events. As the volume of
attacks increase on computer systems, it is important that an organization monitor
activities and respond quickly to attacks. Some of the critical technical requirements
for this type of monitoring are contained in PCI DSS Section 10. In particular, Section
10 requires that organizations address the following issues related to their PCI
systems: installing file integrity monitoring, retaining log files for one year, and
reviewing the security logs daily. EBS had already spent a good deal of time centraliz-
ing logs via syslog and archiving them, as required. However, Paige Davis realized
that the company was not reviewing, on a daily basis, the security logs for EBS
systems that are used for PCI-governed credit card activity.
In order to meet the compliance requirements, Paige had to start doing some
research on the people, processes, and technology needed to meet these require-
ments. First, she would need to understand what types of events were currently
being tracked on PCI systems. Second, she would need to understand how (or if)
the necessary logs were being collected. Third, she would have to determine
how the necessary events could be reviewed daily. She had some serious log
work to do.

Systems monitoring is not to be confused with information security
program monitoring, also known as continuous monitoring,
which is defined by NIST Draft Special Publication 800-137 as “main-
taining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities,
and threats to support organizational risk management decisions.”
SP 800-137 goes on to say: “The objective is to conduct ongoing
monitoring of the security of an organization’s networks, informa-
tion, and systems, and respond by accepting, avoiding/rejecting,
transferring/sharing, or mitigating risk as situations change.”1
Program monitoring is outside the scope of this text. For additional
information on this topic, go to http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/
800-137/SP800-137-Final.pdf.
The second meaning of auditing being examined in this chapter refers to review of the design
and operational outcomes that come from the use of particular systems. In this context, an
audit is a periodic or ad hoc review of program or system functions to determine compliance
with a set of established standards. With regard to network security, this means looking at all
the systems, policies, personnel, and operations associated with protecting the organization’s
information and networking devices and making sure they are operating and being used in
accordance with the will or intent of management. In this text, we examine only those aspects
of auditing that are of benefit to network security along with the standards that are used to
audit network security operations. Keep in mind that auditing is also the term used for
reviews of financial (accounting) systems and information systems. In fact, there are domains
of knowledge for financial auditing and information systems auditing that will have character-
istics that overlap those being discussed here.
Monitoring Network Systems
Monitoring a system involves keeping a close watch on the operations (internal) and usage
(external) of that system—that is, tracking specific events that occur on the system and
recording them in the logs. As a detective control (a security control that detects intrusions),
logging is perhaps one of the best ways to get a picture of what is happening or has
happened on a system.
The term log comes from the formal records kept by ships’ captains as they traveled the open
seas. The term was later adopted by aircraft (and spacecraft) captains as well. As for a com-
puter log, it is a detailed chronological record of the operation of a computer system, includ-
ing the use of that system and any modifications to it. Most modern operating systems have
the ability to collect and store various types of data, including system events, user events, and
security events. In addition, network devices—firewalls, proxies, VPN concentrators, and so
forth—and their associated operating systems or firmware record events in logs.
The basic operation of a system logging facility is to collect information from the operating
system or application whenever specific actions occur. For example, whenever the operating
system receives a request for a user to log in, the OS should send this information to the
logging facility, as shown in Figure 10-1. All the events that trigger entries in the system log
are customizable, giving the administrator control over which events are watched.

What to Audit?
Although logging—or auditing—facilities differ from system to system and application to
application, you have to decide exactly what you are going to monitor on a device. First,
you need to understand that an event is any action that may be of interest to you on a
device. For example, a security event is an occurrence that you think might affect the sys-
tem’s security. The following sections discuss various categories of security events that might
be audited on a system.
Most advanced network devices and server systems give administrators
the ability to modify the audit system in order to choose which events
are logged (as shown in Figure 10-2) and how the log files are
managed (as shown in Figure 10-3). From a security standpoint, we
would like to capture all data possible to help us detect suspicious
behavior or reconstruct the steps of an attack. However, from a
practical standpoint, additional logging can tax system CPU cycles,
memory usage, and storage needed. This tradeoff should be spelled
out clearly in the system audit policy or log management policy. These
policy decisions are discussed later in this chapter.
Process Events Part of being able to audit a computer or other networking device is
having an awareness of the processes and services that are operating within the systems
or network so that you can distinguish between those that should be running and those
that should not. In the domain of information processing, a process is a task being per-
formed by a computing system. This is often done at the same time that the computer
system is processing other tasks. Therefore, many processes may be underway at the
same time, each of them being handled by the systems processor in its turn. Processes

are often called tasks in embedded operating systems. The word process suggests some-
thing that takes time, as opposed to memory, which suggests something that takes up
space.
In general, an operating system process consists of the following attributes:
●
Memory—Contains executable code or task-specific data
●
Operating system resources—File descriptors (in *nix) or handles (in Windows) as
well as other resources allocated by the OS

Many of these attributes are recorded in the logs when the process is created or when it
makes a significant change on the system. However, logs do not provide dynamic
records of running processes. To investigate running processes, we would turn to the
Task Manager in Windows (as shown in Figure 10-4) and the ps command in Linux
(as shown in Figure 10-5).

Services are processes that are designed to operate without user interaction. In the Windows
OS, services are usually initiated (loaded or started) at boot-up as dynamic-link libraries
(DLLs), which consist of software code, data and/or other resources necessary to provide the
service. You can view Windows Services in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), as
shown in Figure 10-6. In a Linux environment, this type of background service is known as
a daemon and is loaded upon start-up in a variety of ways, depending on the Linux distribu-
tion. You can view Ubuntu Linux distribution daemons using the service command, as
shown in Figure 10-7.

Logon Events Although it is important to understand the various processes running on
a system, it is equally important to understand what users are currently on the system.
Tracking user-related activities helps to identify what actions are taking place, who is initiat-
ing those actions, and ultimately provide an overview of the user session. To this end, audit
systems will usually log an event when:
●
A user logs on or off
●
An attempt to log on fails
●
A user starts or stops a network session
Log files may not give you an accurate picture of what users are currently logged on to the
system. To see this information in a Windows environment, use the PsLoggedOn tool,
available free from Microsoft.3 In a Linux environment, use the last command.
Group or Permission Change Events Once an attacker has gained access to a system
through a normal user account (either by cracking a password or through social engineering), the
next step in the attack is to elevate those privileges to those of an administrator. This is referred to
as privilege escalation. Tracking events in which group membership has changed or rights have
been elevated gives security professionals a warning that privilege escalation is occurring.
Resource Access Events Audit systems typically provide the ability to track when
users or processes access files, directories, printers, and other system resources. This type of
information is extremely valuable when trying to investigate an incident or track specific
user activity. It provides granular information about what user performed what activity on
what object and when.
However, auditing is not without costs, and the decision of what events to collect is one of tra-
deoffs. Recording every possible detail for auditing carries a heavy cost. By enabling a
maximum degree of audit detail, you will capture all legitimate events not just those that are
exceptions. The total number of these events can be astronomical. Table 10-1 identifies some
of the types of events that can be captured by the Windows auditing system. In most cases,
system administrators make the tradeoff decisions and limit this type of auditing either to
certain types of events or to certain critical areas of a system, or both.

Network Connection Events Many of the security incidents that concern organiza-
tions the most have to do with the external connections the organization’s systems make to
Internet systems. By tracking the communication sessions that are initiated and torn down,
administrators can detect any access to malicious IP addresses or URLs (provided they are able
to correlate network activity with threat intelligence that lists malicious IP addresses and URLs).
These types of events can be tracked at a system level, but they can also be tracked at
the firewalls (or other network egress points) to provide the most visibility on network
activity. Administrators can track connections that are allowed and established, connec-
tions that are denied and fail, or other network activity that does not fall into the fire-
wall’s ruleset. Figure 10-8 shows a basic example of firewall connection logging using
Ubuntu’s Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) application.
Network Data Transfer Events The exfiltration or unauthorized release of data,
known as data leakage, is a top concern for most security professionals. Losing valuable
company secrets, customers’ personally identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive
information has forced most organizations to focus on technology and programs that pre-
vent this kind of data loss. Tracking the particular Web sessions and the amount of informa-
tion transferred can help organizations identify data leakage as it is occurring and, hope-

fully, stop the activity before it is too late. Systems and network devices can do this type of
monitoring; however, data leakage prevention (DLP) and network proxies provide a much
more granular level of logging information. DLP is implemented as software or an appliance
and is designed to crawl data at rest on hard drives, monitor data saved to removable
media, and monitor communication systems like e-mail or instant messaging, looking for
sensitive data leaving the network.5
System Restart and Shutdown Events Keeping systems available for use is an IT
team’s number one priority. Therefore, it is important that auditing systems keep track of
when systems are booted, restarted, and shut down. From a security perspective, these
types of events may also indicate that a system has been attacked, although the attack,
instead of exploiting the system in some way, led to a crash.
Audit System or Log Events As mentioned earlier, log records are a valuable source of
information, particularly when they are centralized for consolidation and analysis. In most cases,
the auditing system reports when various activities have occurred to the logs—when the logs
have reached their capacities, when they have been truncated, and so forth. This information
can reveal that the logs have been manipulated by an attacker. Unfortunately, attackers are well
aware of this and often delete or modify log records to conceal their activities. For this reason,
unexplained gaps in records or modifications to records are definite indicators of an incident.
Log Management Policy
Auditing events for a single data source (e.g., a server) is extremely important to understand
the health of that particular resource. However, looking at all the data sources within an
IT environment in aggregate provides a more comprehensive picture of the overall health of
the IT environment. To collect, review, and retain those aggregate logs requires a unifying
standard in order to both provide a reliable source for incident management investigations
and an accurate source to meet compliance requirements.
To be effective, logs must first be configured to record event data, as mentioned earlier. Some
types of logging are enabled by default; others must specifically be activated. Log data is
typically stored both locally and also at another recording location separate from the system
being audited. Many organizations choose to create a central logging service (e.g., a central
syslogd server). The central logging service must be configured to be suitably hardened to
protect the information as well as large enough to handle the quantity of data that is usually
collected.6
NIST’s Guide to Computer Security Log Management advocates the following:
To establish and maintain successful log management activities, an organization
should develop standard processes for performing log management. As part of the
planning process, an organization should define its logging requirements and goals.
Based on those, an organization should then develop policies that clearly define
mandatory requirements and suggested recommendations for log management
activities, including log generation, transmission, storage, analysis, and disposal. An
organization should also ensure that related policies and procedures incorporate and
support the log management requirements and recommendations. The organiza-
tion’s management should provide the necessary support for the efforts involving
log management planning, policy, and procedures development.7

To create effective log management practices within your organization, you must address the
following:
●
Storage—You must prepare the system to handle the amount of data generated by
logging. Some systems create gigabytes of data that have to be stored or otherwise
managed. Some systems overwrite older log entries with newer entries in order to
comply with the space limitations of the system. You need to ensure that the rotation
of log entries is acceptable rather than merely accept system defaults.
●
Retention—Log systems can copy logs periodically to remote storage locations for
long-term storage and later investigation. It is important to understand what regulatory
requirements your organization may have in keeping log file information. For organi-
zations that have no formal requirements, there is a debate among security administra-
tors as to what the retention period should be for log files. Retention is the period of
time that log files or log file data should be maintained. Some argue that log files may
be subpoenaed during legal proceedings and, thus, should have short retention periods
and must also then be routinely destroyed to prevent unwanted disclosure during this
process. Others argue that the information to be gained from analyzing legacy and
archival logs outweighs the risk. Still others take a middle ground and aggregate the log
information, then destroy the individual entries. Regardless of the method employed,
some plan must be in place to handle these files, and the legal environment is such that
whatever policy is in place, it must be rigorously followed.
●
Baseline—To recognize and react to abnormal operations and functions of a system,
the administrator must be intimately familiar with the normal operations and func-
tions of the system. This is done through establishing activity baselines. A baseline is a
measurement of activity that represents the normal state or routine condition. The
first baseline is logging all the activity while the server is detached from the network.
This shows you what the system generates on its own. The second baseline is
established by connecting the server to the network—without user activity—and
logging several days’ worth of events to examine the amount and types of activity.
The third baseline is a snapshot of the server in production performing normal tasks
as everyday users log on and operate the system.
●
Encryption—If the organization decides to archive logs, the logs should be encrypted in
storage. Should the log file system be compromised, this prevents unwanted disclosure.
●
Disposal—When log files have outlived their usefulness, and have been retained as
long as policy or procedure allows, they should be routinely and securely destroyed.8
Standard OS Logs
A comprehensive look at the logs produced by network devices and servers is beyond the
scope of this book; however, it is important to look at some common systems to get a sense
of the nature of the type of data that they can log and some of the kinds of information
recorded. To provide such an overview, we will look at Windows and Linux systems.
Windows-Based Logging On most current versions of Microsoft Windows-based
systems, logging is managed by the Event Viewer, which is accessible from the system
control panel, as shown in Figure 10-9. The Event Viewer is actually a snap-in for the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC), a utility designed to allow central management

and administration of a system. Note that you can also use the Wevtutil utility to manage
event logs from the command line, as shown in Figure 10-10.
With the introduction of Windows 7, Microsoft divided logs into two categories: (1) Windows
Logs and (2) Applications and Services Logs.

Windows Logs The Microsoft Windows operating system has a number of data elements
it can report. These are captured in logs, each of which captures the events associated with
that category. In some cases, Windows programs use these logs to record specific program
events as well. Microsoft Technet provides the following list, which outlines the standard
logs and their main purposes:9
●
Application log—This records events generated by specific applications or programs
(see Figure 10-11). For example, a spreadsheet program might record an error for
access to a file in the application log. Each program will have the locations of its
logging activity determined by the associated development team.
●
Security log—This (see Figure 10-12) contains details about security-related events,
such as logon attempts (whether valid or invalid), along with details about resource
use (including creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects). Systems adminis-
trators have the option of specifying the events that are recorded in the security log.
For example, if you have enabled file deletion auditing, each attempt to delete a file is
recorded in the security log.
●
Setup log—This is used to make a record of the various events that occur during
Windows setup and other patches and/or application programs that are installed or
reconfigured (see Figure 10-13).

●
System log—This is used to record events logged by the various components that
make up the Windows operating system (see Figure 10-14). When some system
element fails (e.g., a software driver for a connected hardware device attempting to
initiate itself during startup), the details of that failure are recorded in the system log.
What is logged in the system log is predetermined by Windows.
●
Forwarded Events log—This stores events that have been reported by remote compu-
ters. These events can only be recorded when systems administrators have established
an event subscription.
●
Applications and Services logs—This is made up of four subtypes of information:
Admin, Operational, Analytic, and Debug. These logs are used to record functional
data rather than trying to capture system-wide events. They are used to enable very
specific types of activities, such as application debugging or tracing specific
application activities, as shown in Figure 10-15.

Admin—This area of the log records events intended for end users, administrators, and
support personnel. These events are usually from a problem that is well understood and
has a readily accessible solution that can be acted upon. Figure 10-16 shows how an
Admin/Operational log could be used to identify network issues—with a DHCP client
configuration, for example—if a problem existed.

Operational—This area of the log records operational events that are used to ana-
lyze and diagnose certain issues. This area is often used when a specific action can
be triggered by the log entry. For example, when a printer is added or removed
from a system, an entry here may trigger the installation of a driver for that
printer.


Analytic—This area of the log records events that happen frequently during
routine use and is used to make after-action assessment of systems’
performance. The events are usually the result of problems that cannot be
handled by user action.

Debug—This area of the log is used to record debugging events. These are
generated by developers who may be troubleshooting issues with specific
programs.10
From a network security perspective, the admin and operational logs are the most valuable
to a systems and network administrator in identifying and resolving issues. Of particular
value in the MMC/Event Viewer is the link at the bottom to Event Log Online Help,
which can help diagnose Windows-specific issues. The link brings the admin to the Micro-
soft TechNet Events and Errors Message Center, where the database can be queried to
determine if it is a known issue, as shown in Figure 10-17.
Linux-Based Logging In any operating system it is important to understand the
logging capabilities. Without sufficient logging, it is impossible to tell when a system is
misbehaving, has a security violation, or has been compromised. Linux has files used for
logging various activities on the machine. Although the location depends on the Linux

distribution, these files are typically located in the /var/log/ directory. Here are short descrip-
tions of each file:
●
boot.log—Records events that occur during the boot sequence
●
cron—Contains messages from the cron daemon which allows system administrators
to schedule the execution of processes or application
●
messages—Contains all the messages displayed on the console, which can be
operating system messages or errors, networking messages or errors, or application
messages or errors
●
lastlog—Records the login name, time, and port of the last time each user logged on
to the machine
●
wtmp—Records all logins and logouts that occur on the system
●
utmp—Records information about users that are currently using the system (e.g.,
login times, console, etc.)
●
btmp—Shows a listing of failed login attempts
Syslog Syslog stands for “system logger.” The idea behind syslog is to allow multiple system
utilities to log using the same mechanism, thus alleviating the need for every operating system
utility to implement its own logging facility. Syslog can be used to log messages from Linux appli-
cations and tools, such as Web servers and e-mail programs. From a security standpoint, syslog
also allows organizations to store logs on a separate system altogether, thereby helping to keep
the logs away from abusers who might tamper with their contents and hide their own tracks.
Syslog has its own daemon, syslogd, which runs as a background process. Syslogd uses a configu-
ration file, /etc/syslog.conf, to determine the type and extent of logging to perform. The
syslog.conf file can be configured to report on different levels in different ways. For example, the
following entry logs all info messages to /var/log/messages:
*.info
/var/log/messages.
Figure 10-18 shows a simple example of the syslog.conf file.

Log Management Technology
Most system logs are very difficult to collect, store, read, and understand. In cases where an
administrator is looking for a specific event, the chore can be overwhelming. Luckily, a number
of software manufacturers make tools that make log file analysis much easier.
Log Management A log management tool collects events from log files, processes the
data, stores the results, and performs notification or alerting, as required. Based on the concept
introduced by syslog of consolidating and centralizing all network and system logs, vendors like
ArcSight (purchased by HP), Splunk, Q1 Labs (purchased by IBM), and LogLogic provide a
number of log management tools and appliances to help organizations manage the mountain of
logs. Here are some of the things that log management technologies are designed to do:
●
Collect and centralize events in order to comply with various industry regulations
●
Retain log information in accordance with company policies or regulations
●
Normalize log information among a variety of endpoint technologies (e.g., Windows
systems, Linux systems, Checkpoint firewalls, Juniper routers)
●
Correlate events from the various event sources
●
Provide searching mechanisms to find specific events
●
Provide reporting mechanisms to help analyze the data
A typical log management architecture includes connectors or collectors that are able to
capture events from the various endpoint technologies and systems. These collectors work to
normalize and summarize events as the events are collected. From there, the normalized events
are forwarded to the log management appliance or software for storage. Reports like those
shown in Figure 10-19 can then be generated to help the organization meet compliance
requirements or investigate incidents.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Although log manage-
ment is focused primarily on the collection, centralization, and storage of network event
information, the next level of intelligence is provided by security information and event
management (SIEM) technology. SIEM technology (also known as SEM technology)
provides a layer of correlation that groups similar events from various technologies,
locations, and environments. For example, if an attacker enters through a firewall, is
detected by a network IDPS appliance, tries to log in to a system, and then launches mal-
ware, the SIEM technology should be able to correlate events from the firewall, IDPS,
server, and antivirus logs in order to show a more complete picture of the overall attack.
As shown in Figure 10-20, SIEM technology applies more information to the events to show
geographic location of attacks, correlate this with threat intelligence, and present the system
events in human-readable format. Like the log management architecture, events are collected
from endpoint systems; those events are then normalized and sent to a log management layer
for long-term storage. Additionally, those events can be forwarded from the connectors or the
logging systems to the SIEM database for correlation, alerting, and real-time monitoring.
Security Operations Center (SOC) One of the needs that quickly becomes apparent
with the deployment of log management and SIEM technologies is a talented pool of people
to manage these technologies, watch these events as they occur, and then investigate and
resolve them as needed. A security operations center (SOC) provides the operational infra-
structure to detect attacks and prevent damage to the organization. It is staffed with talented
information security professionals, has mature processes and procedures for repeatable
investigations, and has a SIEM technology to bring all the intelligence to the team’s finger-
tips. Most complex organizations have a SOC that serves as a command center for informa-
tion security activities.

Configuration and Change Management (CCM)
The purpose of configuration and change management (CCM) is to manage the effects of
changes or differences in configurations on an information system or network. Though not
technically part of network monitoring or a formal audit program, this process is crucial in
performing ongoing audits of the network systems and their associated configurations. In
some organizations, configuration management is the identification, inventory, and documen-
tation of the current information system’s status—the hardware, software, and networking
configurations. Change management is sometimes described as a separate function that only
addresses the modifications to this base configuration.
Configuration Management
Just like documents, a system’s technical components—its software, hardware, and
firmware—should have version numbers, revision dates, and other features that allow the
changes made to them to be monitored and administered.
Here are several terms used in CCM:
●
Configuration item—A hardware or software item that is to be modified and revised
throughout its life cycle.
●
Version—The recorded state of a particular revision of a software or hardware
configuration item. The version number is often noted in a specific format: “M.N.b.”
In this notation, “M” is the major release number, and “N.b” can represent various
minor releases or builds within that major release.
●
Major release—A significant revision of the version from its previous state
●
Minor release (update or patch)—A minor revision of the version from its
previous state
●
Build—A snapshot of a particular version of software assembled (or linked) from its
various component modules
●
Build list—A list of the versions of components that make up a build
●
Configuration—A collection of components that make up a configuration item
●
Revision date—The date associated with a particular version or build
●
Software library—A collection of configuration items that is usually controlled and
that developers use to construct revisions and to issue new configuration items
To make these definitions more concrete, imagine there’s a company named Security Solutions
Corporation that develops “the ultimate security solution,” a software application called
Panacea. Here, Panacea is the configuration item, and the configuration consists of three major
software components: See-All, Know-All, and Cure-All. Because this is the first major release of
Panacea and its components, the build list consists of See-All 1.0, Know-All 1.0, and Cure-All
1.0. The revision date is the date associated with the first build.
To create Panacea, the programmers at Security Solutions Corporation pulled information
from their software library. Suppose that while the application is being used in the field, the
programmers discover a minor flaw in a subroutine. When they correct this flaw, they issue
a minor release, Panacea 1.1. If at some point they need to make a major revision to the

software to meet changing market needs or to fix more substantial problems with the sub-
components, they will issue a major release, Panacea 2.0.
The configuration management process helps avoid confusion, problems, and unnecessary
spending, as shown in Figure 10-21. The additional resources required to correct a problem
that could have been prevented through sound configuration management practices is likely
to far exceed the amount of resources required to develop and implement an effective
enterprise process.
NIST Special Publication 800-64, “Security Considerations in the Information System
Development Life Cycle,” outlines the need for configuration and change management:
Configuration management and control procedures are critical to establishing an ini-
tial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware components for the information
system and subsequently to controlling and maintaining an accurate inventory of any
changes to the system. Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware of a system
can have a significant impact on the security of the system…[C]hanges should be
documented, and their potential impact on security should be assessed regularly.
NIST SP 800-53, R.1, “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,”
defines seven CM controls that organizations are required to implement based on an infor-
mation system’s security categorization. These are:
●
CM-1 Configuration Management Policy and Procedures—The organization
develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews and updates (1) a formal,
documented CM policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,

and compliance; and (2) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the imple-
mentation of the CM policy and associated CM controls.
●
CM-2 Baseline Configuration—The organization develops, documents, and
maintains a current baseline configuration of the information system and an
inventory of the system’s constituent components.
●
CM-3 Configuration Change Control—The organization documents and con-
trols changes to the information system. Appropriate organization officials
approve information system changes in accordance with organizational policies
and procedures.

CM-4 Monitoring Configuration Changes—The organization monitors changes
to the information system and conducts security impact analyses to determine
the effects of the changes.
●
CM-5 Access Restrictions for Change—The organization enforces access restric-
tions associated with changes to the information system.
●
CM-6 Configuration Settings—The organization configures the security settings
of IT products to the most restrictive mode consistent with information system
operational requirements.
●
CM-7 Least Functionality—The organization configures the information system
to provide only essential capabilities and specifically prohibits and/or restricts
the use of the following functions; ports, protocols, and/or services: [Assignment:
organization-defined list of prohibited and/or restricted functions, ports, proto-
cols, and/or services]. Information systems are capable of providing a wide vari-
ety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by
default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations
(e.g., key missions, functions). The functions and services provided by informa-
tion systems should be carefully reviewed to determine which functions and ser-
vices are candidates for elimination (e.g., voice over Internet protocol, instant
messaging, file transfer protocol, hypertext transfer protocol, file sharing).
Change Management
Change management seeks to prevent changes that could detrimentally affect the security
of a system. In its entirety, the CCM process reduces the risk that any changes made to a
system (insertions, installations, deletions, uninstallations, or modifications) result in a
compromise to system or data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. It does this by pro-
viding a repeatable mechanism that effects system modifications in a controlled environ-
ment. In accordance with the change management process, system changes must be tested
prior to implementation to observe the effects of the change, thereby minimizing the risk
of adverse results.
Each organization must take into account the costs, the planning and scheduling, and the train-
ing that will be needed for a thorough and effective change management process. However,
because the general approach to change management is universal, organizations can structure
and implement a repeatable process to save organizational resources on future projects.
The change management process also identifies the steps required to ensure that all changes
are properly requested, evaluated, and authorized. Also, the process provides a detailed,

step-by-step procedure for identifying, processing, tracking, and documenting changes. An
example of a change management process is described in the following sections.
Step 1: Identify Change The change process begins with the identifying of a need for
change. The change can be initiated by individuals, such as users or system owners, or it can
be identified by audits or other reviews. It may consist of updating the database fields or
records, or it may consist of upgrading the operating system using the latest security patches.
After the need for a change has been identified, a change request is submitted to the
appropriate decision-making body.
Step 2: Evaluate Change Request After a change request has been made, an
analysis of the affects that the change management will have on the system or related
systems is conducted using the following guidelines:
●
Is the change viable? Does it improve the system’s performance or its security?
●
Is the change the correct one, technically? Is it necessary? Is it feasible, given the
system’s constraints?
●
Will the system’s security be affected by the change?
●
Have the associated costs of implementing the change been considered?
●
Will security components be affected by the change?
Step 3: Implementation Decision After the change has been reviewed and evaluated,
one of the following actions is taken:
●
Approve—Implementation is authorized and may occur at any time after the
appropriate authorization signature has been documented.
●
Deny—The request is denied, regardless of circumstances and information provided.
●
Defer—The decision is postponed until further notice. In this situation, additional
testing or analysis may be needed before a final decision can be made.
Step 4: Implement Approved Change Request If implementation is authorized,
the change is moved from the test environment and into production. In general, the persons
who are updating the production environment should be distinct from the persons who
developed the change in order to provide greater assurance that unapproved changes do
not get implemented.
Step 5: Continuous Monitoring The change process calls for continuous monitor-
ing to ensure that the system is operating as intended and that implemented changes do not
adversely affect either the performance or the security posture of the system. Organizations
can achieve the goals of continuous system monitoring by performing configuration verifica-
tion tests. These tests ensure that the selected configuration for a given system has not been
altered outside the established change process. In addition to configuration verification tests,
organizations can perform system audits.
Configuration verification tests and system audits entail an examination of characteristics of
the system and supporting documentation to verify that the configuration meets user needs
and ensure that the current configuration is the approved system configuration baseline.

Auditing (Formal Review)
In this section, we examine the other definition of auditing, which refers to the systematic review
of an organization to ensure it meets regulations. Auditing must be performed by well-qualified
individuals. In the United States, the Auditing Standards Board of American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants has developed sets of standards referred to as Generally Accepted Auditing
Standards (GAAS). Although they are designed for financial auditing, the principles outlined in
these standards are applicable to technology auditing:
General Standards:
1. The auditor must have adequate technical training and proficiency to perform the audit.
2. The auditor must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters relating to
the audit.
3. The auditor must exercise due professional care in the performance of the audit
and the preparation of the report.
Standards of Field Work
1. The auditor must adequately plan the work and must properly supervise any assistants.
2. The auditor must obtain a sufficient understanding of the entity and its environ-
ment, including its internal control, to assess the risk of material misstatement of
the financial statements whether due to error or fraud, and to design the nature,
timing, and extent of further audit procedures.
3. The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence by performing audit
procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial state-
ments under audit.
Standards of Reporting
1. The auditor must state in the auditor’s report whether the financial statements are
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
2. The auditor must identify in the auditor’s report those circumstances in which
such principles have not been consistently observed in the current period in rela-
tion to the preceding period.
3. When the auditor determines that informative disclosures are not reasonably
adequate, the auditor must so state in the auditor’s report.
4. The auditor must either express an opinion regarding the financial statements, taken as
a whole, or state that an opinion cannot be expressed, in the auditor’s report. When the
auditor cannot express an overall opinion, the auditor should state the reasons therefore
in the auditor’s report. In all cases where an auditor’s name is associated with financial
statements, the auditor should clearly indicate the character of the auditor’s work, if
any, and the degree of responsibility the auditor is taking, in the auditor’s report.11
IT Auditing
Most formal IT audits examine established control objectives and compare those to the
organization’s implementations. This can be done for a single system or for an entire IT
infrastructure and program. One of the most prevalent standards for IT auditing was issued

by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). This document, called
“IT Standards, Guidelines, and Tools and Techniques for Audit and Assurance and Control
Professionals”12 provides a comprehensive set of standards and guidelines for the IT audit
professional. In fact, ISACA provides a certification for auditors; one is declared a Certified
Information Systems Auditor (CISA) after demonstrating five years of work experience as an
auditor and passing an exam that covers the following five job-practice domain areas:
1. The Process of Auditing Information Systems—Provide audit services in
accordance with IT audit standards to assist the organization with protecting
and controlling information systems.
2. Governance and Management of IT—Provide assurance that the necessary
leadership and organizational structures and processes are in place to achieve
objectives and to support the organization’s strategy.
3. Information Systems Acquisition, Development and Implementation—Provide
assurance that the practices for the acquisition, development, testing, and imple-
mentation of information systems meet the organization’s strategies and objectives.
4. Information Systems Operations, Maintenance and Support—Provide assurance
that the processes for information systems operations, maintenance and support
meet the organization’s strategies and objectives.
5. Protection of Information Assets—Provide assurance that the organization’s
security policies, standards, procedures and controls ensure the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of information assets.13
Although the specifics of an audit differ from organization to organization, most audits
follow this approach:
Phase 1: Initiation and Planning
Phase 2: Fieldwork
Phase 3: Analysis and Review
Phase 4: Final Reporting
Phase 5: Follow-up
We will discuss these phases in the following sections.
Phase 1: Initiation and Planning In the initiation portion Phase 1, the auditing
group is contacted by an organizational entity that requested an audit of a particular system,
department, or organization. This could be a senior manager asking for an audit of one or
more organizational components or an external regulatory entity requesting an independent
audit of a third-party organization. Either way, the senior auditing manager contacts the
organization to be audited (if the requester so desires) or makes it “a surprise.” The senior
auditing manager also begins to determine the scope and specifications of the audit, includ-
ing how many systems will be audited and how deep the audit will reach. The standard to
which the target will be audited is also determined.
It is customary for an engagement letter to be developed at this point, which serves as a ser-
vice agreement between the auditing team and the requesting entity. This document includes
information on the details of the audit as well as any contractual components, such as costs,
time frames, etc.

The planning portion of Phase 1 typically includes the formulation and preparation of the
auditing team. Details from the engagement letter are distributed to individual team members,
and specific assignments are made. The logistics of the on-site visit (fieldwork) are developed,
as are any other administrative tasks that will make the next phase more efficient. Should doc-
umentation be available beforehand, including organizational policies, procedures, and stan-
dards, this information is reviewed and incorporated into the audit plan.
Phase 2: Fieldwork The second phase of the audit process involves the on-site visit.
From the target organization’s perspective, this is the audit. A group of auditors arrives on
the site and is given access to systems, documentation, organizational policies, procedures
and standards, and pretty much anything else they need to conduct the evaluation. The
auditing team then begins looking at these documents (if they were not provided previously).
If the auditors were expected, the organization has typically prepared for the on-site visit by
setting up facilities to aid the auditors in their evaluation.
During the fieldwork phase, it is crucial that the target organization provide as much support
for the auditing team as possible. The longer it takes to examine the systems and supporting
documentation, the longer and more expensive the audit can become. It is especially crucial
to make sure that key personnel are made available to answer any questions the auditors
have. Note that the bulk of the audit involves interaction between an auditor and a key
system administrator, network administrator, security professional, or IT manager. The pri-
mary focus of an audit is to determine if the standards and/or regulations the organization
claims to comply with are in fact complied with. This means the organization is “practicing
what it preaches” and not only has developed and disseminated its operational methodology
but (as revealed by a physical investigation of the organization’s systems) also has implemen-
ted that methodology. A security audit (and many IT audits) seeks to determine if critical
controls are implemented and effective, for example.
Phase 3: Analysis and Review The third phase involves taking the findings from the
on-site visit and conducting detailed analyses of those findings. The reports developed by the
various auditors are compiled and compared, and the overall findings are examined. This
can include statistical analysis of surveys and other investigatory data. A category of support
technology known as Computer-Assisted Auditing Techniques (CAATs) is commonly used
to support the on-site investigation and subsequent analysis. CAATs include auditing soft-
ware and hardware designed to improve the auditors’ efficiency and effectiveness.
Phase 4: Final Reporting After the analysis and review are complete, the auditing
team makes a formal report to the target organization and/or requesting entity. This report
summarizes the findings of the audit team. Note that the audit report typically will not spec-
ify how to resolve any identified deficiencies. That is not the purpose of an audit. The audit
is designed to identify deficiencies in an organization’s IT infrastructure and operational
methodology. Resolution of these issues is typically the focus of the audited organization’s
employees and can involve consultants, either internal or external.
Phase 5: Follow-Up At a predetermined interval after the final report has been delivered—
hopefully, after the target organization has had a chance to resolve any issues—there is typically
a follow-up audit. This follow-up is usually not nearly as in-depth or intensive, and it focuses
exclusively on those areas identified as deficient. The results of the follow-up investigation are
summarized in a report and provided to whoever requested the audit.

Systems Certification, Accreditation, and Authorization
In security management, accreditation is what authorizes an IT system to process, store, or
transmit information. It is issued by a management official and serves as a means of ensuring
that systems are of adequate quality. It also challenges managers and technical staff to find the
best methods to ensure security, given technical constraints, operational constraints, and
mission requirements. In the same vein, certification is “the comprehensive evaluation of the
technical and nontechnical security controls of an IT system to support the accreditation
process that establishes the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets a
set of specified security requirements.”14 Organizations pursue accreditation or certification
to gain a competitive advantage or to provide assurance to their customers. IT systems used
by U.S. federal government agencies require accreditation under OMB Circular A-130 and
the Computer Security Act of 1987. Accreditation demonstrates that management has
identified an acceptable risk level and provided resources to control unacceptable risk levels.
Accreditation and certification are not permanent. Just as standards of due diligence and due
care require an ongoing maintenance effort, most accreditation and certification processes
require reaccreditation or recertification every few years (typically every three to five years).
At first glance, it may appear that only systems handling secret government data require
certification or accreditation. However, organizations are increasingly finding that, in order
to comply with all the new federal regulations involving the protection of personal privacy,
they need formal mechanisms for verifying and validating their systems.
Auditing for Government and Classified Information Systems
Two documents provide guidance for the certification and accreditation of information
system used by the U.S. federal government agencies:
●
SP 800-37, Rev. 1: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.
●
NSTISSI No. 1000: National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation
Process (NIACAP).
Information processed by the federal government is grouped into three categories: national
security information (NSI), non-NSI, and intelligence community (IC). National security
information is processed on national security systems (NSSs). NSSs are managed and oper-
ated by the Committee for National Systems Security (CNSS), and non-NSSs are managed
and operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Intelligence
community (IC) information is a separate category and is handled according to guidance
from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
The Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) defines an NSS as any information sys-
tem (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by an agency or by a con-
tractor of any agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency, the function, operation,
or use of which:15

an act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign
policy
However, the Federal Information Security Management Act states that this criterion “does
not include a system that is to be used for routine administration and business applications
(including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications.)”16
National security information must be processed on NSSs, which have more stringent
requirements. NSSs (which process a mix of NSI and non-NSI) are accredited using CNSS
guidance. Non-NSS systems follow NIST guidance. More than a score of major government
agencies store, process, or transmit NSI, and many of them have both NSSs and systems that
are not rated as NSSs. You can learn more about the CNSS community and how NSSs are

and NIST have transformed the formal certification and accreditation (C&A) program for non-
NSI systems from a separate C&A process into an integrated risk management framework
(RMF) that can be used for normal operations and yet still provide assurance that the systems
are capable of reliably housing confidential information. NIST SP 800-37, Revision 1 provides
a detailed description of the new RMF process (see http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/
800-37-rev1/sp800-37-rev1-final.pdf).
NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1 specifically cites NIST SP 800-39, “Integrated Enterprise-Wide Risk
Management: Organization, Mission, and Information System View,” as the reference for
its RMF. The NIST RMF uses a three-tiered approach to risk management, as shown in
Figure 10-22. The following text is taken from the recommendations of the Joint Task Force
Transformation Initiative that prepared NIST Special Publication 800-37, Rev. 1:

Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective with the development of
a comprehensive governance structure and organization-wide risk management
strategy.…
Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective and is
guided by the risk decisions at Tier 1. Tier 2 activities are closely associated
with enterprise architecture.…
Tier 3 addresses risk from an information system perspective and is guided by
the risk decisions at Tiers 1 and 2. Risk decisions at Tiers 1 and 2 impact the
ultimate selection and deployment of needed safeguards and countermeasures
(i.e., security controls) at the information system level. Information security
requirements are satisfied by the selection of appropriate management, opera-
tional, and technical security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53.
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) [shown in Figure 10-23] provides a
disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk
management activities into the system development life cycle. The RMF operates
primarily at Tier 3 in the risk management hierarchy but can also have interac-
tions at Tiers 1 and 2 (e.g., providing feedback from ongoing authorization
decisions to the risk executive [function], dissemination of updated threat and
risk information to authorizing officials and information system owners).

The RMF steps include:
●
Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and
transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis.
●
Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on
the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline
as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local conditions.
●
Implement the security controls and describe how the controls are employed
within the information system and its environment of operation.
●
Assess
the
security
controls
using
appropriate
assessment
procedures
to
determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating
as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system.
●
Authorize information system operation based on a determination of the risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
nation resulting from the operation of the information system and the decision
that this risk is acceptable.
●
Monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis
including assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or
its environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the
associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system to designated
organizational officials.17
The bottom line is that if your organization’s systems are subject to these standards, they
must be configured, operated, and audited accordingly.
Auditing and the ISO 27000 Series
Most commercial systems audit against a recognized standard. Currently, the most widely rec-
ognized one is called “Information Technology—Code of Practice for Information Security
Management.” Published in 2000 as British Standard BS7799, this document, now known as
ISO/IEC 17799, was adopted as an international standard framework for information security
by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechni-
cal Commission (IEC). It was revised in 2005 (as ISO 17799:2005) and then renamed ISO
27002 in 2007 when it was aligned with ISO 27001. Although the details of ISO/IEC 27002
are available to those who purchase the standard, here are the areas it covers:
1. Risk Assessment and Treatment
2. Security Policy
3. Organization of Information Security
4. Asset Management
5. Human Resource Security
6. Physical and Environmental Security
7. Communications and Operations
8. Access Control

For more details on these ISO/IEC sections, see www.praxiom.com/iso-17799-2005.htm.
The stated purpose of ISO/IEC 27002 is to provide recommendations for information
security management for use by those who are responsible for initiating, implementing,
or maintaining security in their organization. It is intended to provide a common basis
for developing organizational security standards and effective security management prac-
tice and to provide confidence in interorganizational dealings. It is also designed to serve
as a metric for the assessment of “good security management” within the organization,
as defined in the ISO series.
Whereas ISO/IEC 27001 provides a broad overview—information on 127 controls divided
into 10 areas—ISO/IEC 27002 provides information on how to implement ISO/IEC 27001
and how to set up an information security management system (ISMS). The major steps of
this process are presented in Figure 10-24. In the United Kingdom, the correct implementa-
tion of these standards (as determined by a BS7799 certified evaluator) allows an organiza-
tion to obtain ISMS certification and accreditation.
ISO/IEC 27001 provides implementation details using a step-by-step process that outlines
how you should approach implementing change. This is known as the Plan-Do-Check-Act
cycle:18
Plan:
1. Define the scope of the ISMS.
2. Define an ISMS policy.
3. Define the approach to risk assessment.
4. Identify the risks.
5. Assess the risks.
6. Identify and evaluate options for the treatment of risk.
7. Select control objectives and controls.
8. Prepare a statement of applicability (SOA).
Do:
9. Formulate a risk treatment plan.
10. Implement the risk treatment plan.
11. Implement controls.
12. Implement training and awareness programs.
13. Manage operations.
14. Manage resources.
15. Implement procedures to detect and respond to security incidents.

Although ISO/IEC 27001 provides some implementation information, it simply specifies what
must be done—not how to do it. As stated earlier, its primary purpose is to enable organiza-
tions to obtain certification; thus, it serves more as an assessment tool than an implementa-
tion framework.
Auditing and COBIT
Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) provides advice
about the implementation of sound controls and control objectives for information secu-
rity. This document can be used not only as a planning tool for information security but
also as an auditing framework controls model. COBIT was created in 1992 by the Infor-
mation Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and the IT Governance Institute
(ITGI). Documentation on COBIT was first published in 1996 and then updated in 1998,
2000, 2003, 2005, and 2007 (May). ISACA has prepared the following introduction to the
COBIT framework:
COBIT is an IT governance framework and supporting toolset that allows managers
to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues, and business risks.
COBIT enables clear policy development and good practice for IT control through-
out organizations. ITGI’s latest version—COBIT 4.0—emphasizes regulatory
compliance, helps organizations to increase the value attained from IT, enables
alignment, and simplifies implementation of the COBIT framework. It does not
invalidate work done based on earlier versions of COBIT but instead can be used to
enhance work already done based upon those earlier versions. When major activities
are planned for IT governance initiatives, or when an overhaul of the enterprise con-
trol framework is anticipated, it is recommended to start fresh with COBIT 4.0.
COBIT 4.0 presents activities in a more streamlined and practical manner so contin-
uous improvement in IT governance is easier than ever to achieve.19
COBIT presents 34 high-level objectives that cover 215 control objectives. The control objec-
tives are categorized into four domains, which are discussed in the following sections. Those
domains are: plan and organize, acquire and implement, deliver and support, and monitor
and evaluate.
Although COBIT was designed to be an IT governance structure, it provides a framework to
support information security requirements and assessment needs. Organizations that incorpo-
rate COBIT assessments into their IT governance are better prepared for general information
security risk management operations.

10
Plan and Organize This domain focuses on the planning and organization of IT use,
including recommendations for achieving goals and objectives. Part of this process is to
examine the form IT takes in the organization to obtain the best possible results. The
high-level controlling objectives for planning and organization are:
PO1—Define a Strategic IT Plan.
PO2—Define the Information Architecture.
PO3—Determine Technological Direction.
PO4—Define the IT Processes, Organization, and Relationships.
PO5—Manage the IT Investment.
PO6—Communicate Management Aims and Direction.
PO7—Manage IT Human Resources.
PO8—Manage Quality.
PO9—Assess and Manage IT Risks.
PO10—Manage Projects.
Acquire and Implement The acquisition and implementation domain focuses on the
specification of requirements, the acquisition of needed components, and the integration of
these components into the organization’s systems. Ongoing maintenance and change
requirements to extend the usability of the system are also focused on. The high-level
controlling objectives for acquiring and implementing are:
AI1—Identify Automated Solutions.
AI2—Acquire and Maintain Application Software.
AI3—Acquire and Maintain Technology Infrastructure.
AI4—Enable Operation and Use.
AI5—Procure IT Resources.
AI6—Manage Changes.
AI7—Install and Accredit Solutions and Changes.
Delivery and Support The delivery and support domain focuses on the functionality
of the system for the end user. It also focuses on the systems applications—including the
input, processing, and output components. Efficiency and effectiveness of operations are
critical to the system function, and therefore processes that support those operations
are also examined. The high-level controlling objectives for delivery and support are:
DS1—Define and Manage Service Levels.
DS2—Manage Third-Party Services.
DS3—Manage Performance and Capacity.
DS4—Ensure Continuous Service.
DS5—Ensure Systems Security.
DS6—Identify and Allocate Costs.

DS8—Manage Service Desk and Incidents.
DS9—Manage the Configuration.
DS10—Manage Problems.
DS11—Manage Data.
DS12—Manage the Physical Environment.
DS13—Manage Operations.
Monitor and Evaluate The monitor and evaluate domain focuses on the alignment
between IT systems usage and organizational strategy. This assessment identifies the regula-
tory requirements for which controls are needed. Another function of this domain is
monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of IT systems against the organizational control
processes in the delivery and support domain. The high-level controlling objectives for
monitoring and evaluating are:
ME1—Monitor and Evaluate IT Processes.
ME2—Monitor and Evaluate Internal Control.
ME3—Ensure Regulatory Compliance.
ME4—Provide IT Governance.
The latter sections are much more suited to systems auditing than the former. With an eye
toward the objectives of an information system, the functions of it become much more critical.
Auditing compares the functions to the objectives and identifies deficiencies.
Chapter Summary
■
The term auditing has more than one meaning. It can refer to the ongoing review of a
system’s functional data to evaluate proper operation of the system, detect potential
incidents, and ensure compliance with systems policies. Alternatively, it can refer to a
periodic self-review of the network environment to evaluate it against policy
requirements.
■
The process of monitoring a system involves keeping a close watch on both the
internal operations and the use of that system.
■
A computer or network device log is a detailed chronological record of the
operation of a computer system, including the use and modification of that system.
The kinds of events to be recorded include process events, logon events, group or
permission change events, resource access events, network connection events,
network data transfer events, system restarts and shutdown events, and audit system
or log events.
■
Aggregated log files from network devices, servers, and even critical workstations
must be well managed and should typically be stored off the entity that generates
them, and this storage area must be suitably hardened to protect the information.
Log management deals with storage, retention, baselining, encryption, and
disposal.

■
Key log sources include: Windows-based systems logs, such as Application,
Security, Setup, Forwarded Events, and System logs, as well as the Windows-
specific Admin, Operational, and Debug logs. Linux-based logging uses files for
recording various activities on the system. These files, typically located in the /var/
log/ directory, include boot.log, cron, messages, lastlog, wtmp, btmp, and utmp.
Linux also has a centralized logging facility named syslog that allows multiple
system utilities to log using the same mechanism.
■
Given that system logs are often difficult to collect, store, read, and understand, log
management solutions have been made available. These tools collect events from log
files, process the data, store the results, and provide notifications or alerts, as
required. The goals for log management technologies are to collect and centralize
events, retain log information, normalize log information, correlate events, provide
searching, and provide reporting.
■
An advanced form of log management called security information and
event management (SIEM) provides superior correlation and notification
capabilities.
■
Some organizations find the need for a Security Operations Center (SOC) to provide
the operational infrastructure for detecting attacks, coordinating responses, and
reducing damage to the organization.
■
Change and Configuration Management (CMM) controls the effects of revisions
to configurations on information systems and networks, a crucial aspect in per-
forming ongoing audits of the network systems and their associated configura-
tions. Configuration management seeks to monitor and perhaps control complex
systems configuration in an organization. Change management seeks to prevent
and/or control changes that could detrimentally affect the security posture of a
system.
■
Auditing should be performed by individuals who are well qualified using a set
of Generally Accepted Auditing Standards. Auditors must have adequate
technical training and proficiency to perform the audit and must maintain
independence.
■
The certification and accreditation of federal information systems is governed by
two documents: SP 800-37, Rev. 1 (“Guide for Applying the Risk Management
Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach”) and
the CNSS Instruction-1000 (“National Information Assurance Certification and
Accreditation Process”).
■
Currently, the most widely recognized model for security assessment and practice,
found in the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards, is called “Information Technology—
Code of Practice for Information Security Management.”
■
IT auditing examines established control objectives and compares them with the
actual implementations of the organization. Control Objectives for Information and
Related Technology (COBIT) provides advice about the implementation of sound
controls and control objectives for information security.

Hands-On Projects
Project 10-1
This project examines ways to audit various processes and services in a typical
Windows environment. To successfully complete this project, you need a
functioning Windows 7 system.
There are several methods for auditing running processes and services in
a typical Windows 7 environment. In this project, we use the Task Manager.
1.
To open the Task Manager, click the Windows Start button and type taskmgr.exe in
the Search Programs and Files box at the bottom of the menu. Make sure the file
appears in the search results at the top of the search box, and then press Enter. The
Windows Task Manager window appears.
2.
There are several tabs across the window that allow you to examine various applica-
tions, processes, and services running on the system. Click the Processes tab to show a
list of running processes. If you are logged in as a user with administrative privileges,
you can click the Show processes from all users box to show processes for all users
currently running; otherwise, you can only see processes spawned by your user account.
3.
Right-click one of the entries in the window and select Properties from the menu. Here,
you can see details about the file, such as size, location, and details regarding when the
file was created, last modified, and last accessed. To see which users have permissions
associated with this file, click the Security tab to see both the list of users or groups
and the permissions given to each.
4.
Scroll through the list, paying particular attention to the filenames listed in the Image Name
column. If you logged in as an administrator and enabled the check box, as described in the
previous step, pay attention to the names listed in the User Name column. If you see an
image name you’re not familiar with, use a search engine like Google or Bing to search for
that image name. If, based on your research of the image name, you believe the process
should not be running or could be malicious, you may want to stop the process from run-
ning. Do this by right-clicking the entry in the window and selecting End Process from the
menu. This should be done with extreme care and only after thoroughly researching the
process in question. Killing critical processes such as explorer.exe can make the system
unstable and force you to reboot the system to make it usable again.
5.
Click the Services tab to view the list of running services.

6.
As you did earlier, examine the list of running service names to see if there are any
unfamiliar services running. You may also right-click an unfamiliar service and select
Go to Process to see the process this service is associated with. If, based on your
research of the service, you believe the service should not be running, you may
want to stop the service from running. To do this, right-click the service and choose
Go to Process to be taken to the process responsible for this service, then right-click
the service and select End Process from the menu. As discussed earlier, this should
be done with extreme care and only after thoroughly researching the process in
question.
Project 10-2
This project examines ways to audit various processes and services in a typical Linux
environment. To successfully complete the project, you need a functioning Linux system.
We used the BackTrack R1 application running in a virtual environment.
There are several methods for auditing running processes and services in a typical Linux
environment. In this project, we use the ps command.
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type ps and press Enter. A list of active jobs will appear.
3. For details about the active jobs, type ps x and press Enter. The x option displays
information about the services and processes that are running in our X-windows
session, as shown in Figure 10-25.

4. Depending on circumstances, you may need to see a complete list of processes running
system-wide. To do this, type ps –AF and press Enter. Note the addition of a new col-
umn that shows the user ID (UID) that the listed service or process is running under.
The output should look similar to what is shown in Figure 10-26.
5. You can also audit running processes and services using the top command, which
allows you to view processes running in real-time, with periodic updates. Open a
terminal window.
6. Type top and press Enter. Your results should be similar to what is shown in
Figure 10-27.
7. The default view displays, based on CPU usage. However, this sort option can be
changed. To change the sort option, type F (note this is a capital letter).
8. You will now see a list of sortable options. Type n to sort by memory usage. Note that
the Current Sort Field in the upper-left corner has changed from K to N, and that the
menu item now has an asterisk to its left, as shown in Figure 10-28. Press Enter to
return to the main display.
9. We will now examine the processes in the order they started on the system. Type
F. When the sort menu appears, type a to sort by process ID (PID), then press Enter to
return to the main display.
10. The order is inverted, with the display showing the largest PID first. To reverse this,
type R (note that this is a capital letter). Notice the order has changed, and the lowest
PIDs are now being displayed, as shown in Figure 10-29.

Introduction
In addition to deliberate attacks from hostile parties, networks are susceptible to outside
events and internal failures. In fact, many network outages are the unintended consequences
of actions taken by friendly parties. When the network is disrupted, business operations often
come to a standstill. NIST Special Publication 800-34 Rev 1, “Contingency Planning Guide
for Federal Information Systems,” specifies the following:
Because information system resources are so essential to an organization’s suc-
cess, it is critical that identified services provided by these systems are able to
operate effectively without excessive interruption. Contingency planning supports
this requirement by establishing thorough plans, procedures, and technical
measures that can enable a system to be recovered as quickly and effectively as
possible following a service disruption. Contingency planning is unique to each
system, providing preventive measures, recovery strategies, and technical consid-
erations appropriate to the system’s information confidentiality, integrity, and
availability requirements and the system impact level.1
EBS had made great strides in preparing for the upcoming PCI audit. The IT team had
remediated a number of issues with its firewalls and intrusion prevention devices,
and it had audited a number of security program components that hadn’t been scru-
tinized in years. It was determined to address its security problems so as not to affect
PCI compliance.
Still, Scott McCaffrey, the IT operations manager, was nervous. He and his staff
had made great strides since the EBS Web site had been hacked several years before.
Because the company had been fortunate enough not to suffer another attack, there
had been no real-world test of the incident management process that had been
enacted at that time. The EBS IT staff felt confident, but they didn’t want to slide
back into the reactive security posture that had allowed the initial Web defacement.
Because Paige Davis was leading the PCI compliance effort, Scott entrusted her to
lead the effort in updating the process. Paige enlisted some of the security folks to
research and document threats, categorize the threats to help educate the rest of
the IT staff, and analyze the EBS’ security defenses in relation to these documented
threats. These combined actions would help EBS understand its current IT “enemies”
and develop the appropriate responses.

Some organizations—such as federal and state governmental agen-
cies, financial institutions, and healthcare providers—are required by
law or other mandate to have such procedures in place at all times.
Organizations in both the public and private sectors should prepare for the unexpected. In
general, an organization’s ability to weather losses caused by an unexpected event depends
on proper planning and execution of such a plan; without a workable plan, an unexpected
event can cause severe damage to an organization’s information resources and assets, from
which it may never recover. “On average, over 40 percent of businesses that don’t have a
disaster plan go out of business after a major loss like a fire, a break-in, or a storm.”2
What Is Contingency Planning?
Contingency planning (CP) is the process by which the information technology and informa-
tion security teams position their organizations to prepare for, detect, react to, and recover
from man-made or natural events that threaten the security of information resources and
assets. The main goal of CP is to restore normal modes of operation, with minimal cost and
disruption to business activities, after a disruptive event has occurred. Ideally, CP should
ensure that information systems are continuously available to the organization.
CP consists of four integrated components:
●
Business impact analysis (BIA)
●
Incident response plan (IR plan)
●
Disaster recovery plan (DR plan)
●
Business continuity plan (BC plan)
Depending on the size and business philosophy of an organization, information technology and
information security managers can either (1) create and develop these four components as one
unified plan or (2) create the four components separately in conjunction with a set of interlocking
procedures that assure continuity. Larger, more-complex organizations will typically create and
develop the CP components separately, given that the functions of each component differ in
scope, applicability, and design. Smaller organizations tend to adopt a one-plan method consisting
of a straightforward set of recovery strategies. Even in those organizations that develop indepen-
dent plans, however, there is usually a high degree of collaboration and cooperation (information
sharing) among the various groups that develop and test the individual components.
In general, four teams of individuals are involved in contingency planning and contingency
operations:
●
The CP Management Team (CPMT), also known as the CP Team, manages the over-
all CP process, performing the following functions:

Developing the master plan for all CP operations

Collecting information about information systems and the threats they face

Conducting the BIA

The CPMT often consists of a coordinating manager, a few CPMT representatives from vari-
ous business functions, and representatives from each of the subordinate teams.
•
The incident response (IR) team develops, tests, manages, and executes the IR plan by
detecting, evaluating, and responding to incidents.
•
The disaster recovery (DR) team develops, tests, manages, and executes the disaster
recovery plan by detecting, evaluating, and responding to disasters and by reestablish-
ing operations at the primary business site.
•
The business continuity (BC) team develops, tests, manages, and executes the business
continuity plan by setting up and starting off-site operations in the event of an incident
or disaster.
Incident response focuses on immediate response to small-scale events, such as hacking
attempts, malware outbreaks, and misuse of corporate assets. However, if the incident esca-
lates into a disaster, the IR plan may give way to the DR plan and BC plan, as shown in
Figure 11-1. The DR plan typically focuses on restoring systems after disasters occur; there-
fore, it is closely associated with the BC plan. In some organizations, these two plans are
considered one plan, which is known as the Business Resumption Plan. The BC plan occurs
concurrently with the DR plan when the damage is major or long term, requiring more than
simple restoration of information and information resources, as shown in Figure 11-2.
Some experts argue that the three plans contained within CP are so closely linked that
they are indistinguishable. In fact, each has a distinct place, role, and planning requirements.

Furthermore, each plan (IR, DR, and BC) comes into play at a specific time in the life of an
incident. Figure 11-3 shows this sequence and shows the overlap that may occur. How the
plans interact and the ways in which they are brought into action are discussed in the sections
that follow.
Stages and Components of Contingency Planning
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as noted in NIST Special
Publication 800-34 Rev.1: Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems, CP
involves the following major steps:
1. Form the CPMT. Assemble the management team that will guide CP planning
and execution. This includes representatives from business management, opera-
tions and the projected subordinate teams.
2. Develop the contingency planning policy statement. The CP Policy is the for-
mal policy that will guide the efforts of the subordinate teams in developing
their plans, and the overall operations of the organization during contingency
operations.
3. Conduct the BIA. The BIA, described later in this chapter, helps identify and
prioritize organizational functions, and the information systems and compo-
nents critical to supporting the organization’s mission/business processes.

4. Form subordinate planning teams. For each of the subordinate areas, organize
a team to develop the IR, DR and BC plans. These groups may or may not
contain individuals responsible for implementing the plan.
5. Develop subordinate planning policies. Just as the CPMT developed an overall
CP policy, the newly formed IR, DR and BC planning teams will begin by
developing an IR, DR or BC planning policy, respectively.
6. Integrate the BIA. Each of the subordinate planning teams will independently
review and incorporate aspects of the BIA of importance to their planning
efforts. As different teams may need different components, the actions and
assessments of each team may vary.
7. Identify preventive controls. Assess those countermeasures and safeguards that
mitigate the risk and impact of events on organizational data, operations and
personnel.
8. Organize Response Teams. Specify the skills needed on each subordinate
response team (IR/DR/BC) and identify personnel needed. Ensure personnel
rosters are exclusive (no personnel on two different teams) and that all needed
skills are covered. These are the individuals who will be directly called up if a
particular plan is activated in response to an actual incident or disaster.
9. Create contingency strategies. The CPMT, with input from the subordinate team
leaders will evaluate and invest in strategies that will support the IR, DR and BC
efforts should an event impact business operations. These include data backup
and recovery plans, offsite data storage and alternate site occupancy strategies.

10. Develop subordinate plans. For each subordinate area develop a plan to han-
dle the corresponding actions and activities necessary to a) respond to an inci-
dent, b) recover from a disaster and c) establish operations at an alternate site
following a disruptive event.
11. Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises. Ensure each subordinate plan is
tested and the corresponding personnel are trained to handle any event that
escalates into an incident or a disaster.
12. Ensure plan maintenance. Manage the plan, ensuring periodic review, evalua-
tion and update.3
The flow of these steps integrates the efforts of the various tasks (BIA, IR planning, DR plan-
ning, and BC planning), as shown in Figure 11-4.
Depending on the organization, the DR and BC planning could be integrated into a Business
Resumption Plan, as mentioned earlier. In this event, the overall planning methodology
would address the general contingency-planning strategies as well as the business resumption
components. The IR planning would be developed and integrated into the overall CP plan-
ning process but would also require additional information, as described next.

the threats they face. It is a crucial component, given that it provides an assessment of
the system operations that the organization absolutely needs to keep going during and after an
event. According to NIST Special Publication 800-34, Rev.1, the BIA involves three major steps:
1.
Determine mission/business processes and recovery criticality. Mission/Business
processes supported by the system are identified and the impact of a system dis-
ruption to those processes is determined along with outage impacts and esti-
mated downtime. The downtime should reflect the maximum time that an
organization can tolerate while still maintaining the mission.4
2.
Identify resource requirements. Realistic recovery efforts require a thorough
evaluation of the resources required to resume mission/business processes and
related interdependencies as quickly as possible. Examples of resources that
should be identified include facilities, personnel, equipment, software, data
files, system components, and vital records.5
3.
Identify recovery priorities for system resources. Based upon the results from
the previous activities, system resources can be linked more clearly to critical
mission/business processes and functions. Priority levels can be established for
sequencing recovery activities and resources.6
An example of the three stages of a BIA is shown in Figure 11-5.

seconds.”7 The Institute also reports that organizations “will not know what to do in the
event of an intrusion if the necessary procedures, roles, and responsibilities have not been
defined and exercised in advance.” The absence of systematic and well-defined procedures,
it says, can lead to:
●
Extensive damage to data, systems, and networks due to not taking timely
action to contain an intrusion. This can result in increased costs, loss of
productivity, and loss of business.
●
The possibility of an intrusion affecting multiple systems both inside and
outside your organization because staff did not know who else to notify
and what additional actions to take.
●
Negative exposure in the news media that can damage your organization’s
stature and reputation with your shareholders, your customers, and the
community at large.
●
Possible legal liability and prosecution for failure to exercise an adequate
standard of due care when your systems are inadvertently or intentionally
used to attack others.8
The actions an organization should take while an incident is in progress are defined in a doc-
ument referred to as the incident response (IR) plan. You might care to note that NIST has
begun using the term “Cyber Incident Response Plan” (CIRP) to differentiate computer inci-
dents from physical incidents. An incident is any clearly identified attack on the organization’s
information assets that would threaten the assets’ confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The
IR plan deals with the identification, classification, response, and recovery from an incident
and provides answers to questions that victims might pose in the midst of an incident, such
as “What do I do now?” For example, a systems administrator may notice that someone is
copying information from the server without authorization, signaling a policy violation by a
potential hacker or an employee. What should the administrator do first? Whom should he
or she contact? What should he or she document? The IR plan supplies the answers.
For example, in the event of a serious virus or worm outbreak, the IR plan may be used to
assess the likelihood of imminent damage and to inform key decision makers in the various
communities of interest (IT, information security, organization management, and users). The
IR plan also enables the organization to take coordinated action that is either predefined and
specific or ad hoc and reactive.
We will delve deeper into the aspects of the IR plan later in this chapter.
Disaster Recovery Plan The next vital part of contingency planning is the disaster
recovery plan. The IT community of interest, under the leadership of the CIO, is often
made responsible for disaster recovery planning, including aspects that are not necessarily
technology based.
Disaster recovery planning (DRP) entails the preparation for and recovery from a disaster,
whether natural or human-made. For example, if a malicious program evades containment
actions and infects or disables most of an organization’s systems and its ability to function,
the DR plan is activated. Sometimes, incidents are, by their nature, immediately classified as
disasters, such as an extensive fire, flood, damaging storm, or earthquake.

In general, a disaster has occurred when either of two criteria is met: (1) the organization is
unable to contain or control the impact of an incident, or (2) the level of damage or destruction
from an incident is so severe that the organization cannot quickly recover from it. The distinc-
tion between an incident and a disaster may be subtle. The CP team must document in the DR
plan whether an event is classified as an incident or a disaster. This determination is critical
because it determines which plan is activated. The key role of a DR plan is defining how to rees-
tablish operations at the location where the organization usually operates.
Business Continuity Plan Business continuity planning (BCP) ensures that critical
business functions can continue if a disaster occurs. Unlike the DR plan, which is usually
managed by the IT community of interest, the business continuity plan (BC plan) is most
properly managed by the CEO of an organization. It is activated and executed concurrently
with the DR plan when the disaster is major or long term and requires fuller and complex
restoration of information and IT resources. If a disaster has rendered the current business
location unusable, there must be a plan to allow the business to continue to function.
Although the BC plan reestablishes critical business functions at an alternate site, the DR plan
focuses on the reestablishment of the technical infrastructure and business operations at the
primary site. Not every business needs such a plan or such facilities. Some small companies
or fiscally sound organizations may be able to simply cease operations until the primary facili-
ties are restored. Manufacturing and retail organizations, however, depend on continued
operations for revenue. Thus, these entities must have a BC plan in place so as to quickly relo-
cate operations with minimal loss of revenue.
CP Disruption Phases The CP Disruption Phases define the actions that actually occur
when an event becomes an incident and/or disaster. According to NIST Special Publication
800-34 Rev.1, an organization goes through three distinct phases when reacting to an event
that is determined to pose a threat to the organization:
1.
The Activation/Notification Phase describes the process of activating the
plan based on outage impacts and notifying recovery personnel.
2.
The Recovery Phase details a suggested course of action for recovery teams
to restore system operations at an alternate site or using contingency capa-
bilities.
3.
The Reconstitution Phase includes activities to test and validate system
capability and functionality and outlines actions that can be taken to return
the system to normal operating conditions and prepare the system against
future outages.9
For evaluating IR life cycles, NIST’s Computer Security Incident Handling Guide10suggests a
four-step life cycle: (1) preparation, (2) detection and analysis, (3) containment, eradication,
and recovery, and (4) postincident activity. These categories could be used as replacements
for the CP stages, given that they address the same basic functions, as described in later sec-
tions. Whether the event is an incident or full-scale disaster, the progression through these
phases is the same. What is different between incidents and disasters is the escalation compo-
nent, whereby an event becomes an incident and then is escalated to a disaster, or goes
straight from event to disaster. This determination is part of the CP Activation/Notification
phase or the IR Detection and Analysis phase.

There are a number of data backup and management methods that aid in contingency plan-
ning and eventual recovery. The most commonly used varieties, disk backup and tape backup,
are presented here. Backup methods must be based on an established policy that meets organi-
zational needs. In general, data files and critical system files should be backed up daily, with
nonessential files backed up weekly.
Equally important is the determination of how long data should be stored. Some data must,
according to law, be stored for specific lengths of time. If data is not covered by law or regu-
lation, it may be in the organization’s best interest to destroy it quickly. Management should
create a formal data retention plan that includes recommendations from legal counsel that
conform to the applicable laws, regulations, and standards. For routine data backups of criti-
cal data, the organization only needs to retain the one or two most recent copies (daily back-
ups) and at least one off-site copy. For full backups of entire systems, at least one copy should
be stored in a secure location, such as a bank vault, security deposit box, remote branch
office, or other secure data storage facility.
Disk-to-Disk-to-Tape
With the decrease in the costs of storage media, including hard drives and tape backups,
more and more organizations are creating massive arrays of independent, large-capacity disk
drives to store information, at least temporarily, in storage area networks (SANs). In fact,
many home users are employing similar methods, adding external USB-mounted ATA drives,
in the 200–300 GB range, and simply copying critical files to these external and portable
devices as routine backup. The availability of these devices not only precludes the need for
time-consuming tape backups, but it also avoids the costs and implementation challenges of
employing tape at the user level. It also allows quick and easy recovery of individual files
and directories, as opposed to making extractions from tape.
Individuals and organizations alike can build libraries of these devices or massively connected
SANs to support larger-scale data backup and recovery. The problem with this technology is
the lack of redundancy if both the online and backup versions fail, because of a virus or
hacker intrusion. This is why the secondary data disk series should be periodically backed
up to tape or other removable media.
Backup Strategies
There are three basic types of backups: full, differential, and incremental. A full backup is
just that, a complete backup of the entire system, including all applications, operating sys-
tems components, and data. The advantage of a full backup is that it takes a comprehensive
snapshot of the organization’s system. The primary disadvantages are that it can require large
amounts of media and can be time-consuming. A differential backup is the storage of all files
that have changed or have been added since the last full backup. The differential backup is fas-
ter and uses less storage space than the full backup, but each daily differential backup is larger
and slower than that of the day before. For example, if you conduct a full backup on Sunday,
then Monday’s backup contains all the files that have changed since Sunday, and Tuesday’s
backup contains all the files that have changed since Sunday, including Monday. By Friday,
the quantity of data to back up has increased substantially. If one backup is corrupt, the previ-
ous day’s backup contains almost all the same information. An incremental backup only

archives the data that have been modified since the last backup (regardless of type), and thus
requires less space and time than a differential backup. The disadvantage of incremental back-
ups is that if an incident occurs, multiple backups are needed to restore the full system. In gen-
eral, incremental backups are designed to complete the backup in the shortest elapsed time. An
incremental backup also requires less storage space.
Regardless of the strategy employed, the following guidelines apply: (1) All on-site and off-site
storage must be secured. It is common practice to use media-certified fireproof safes or filing
cabinets to store backup media. The off-site storage in particular must be in a safe location,
such as a safety deposit box in a bank or at a professional backup and recovery service. The
trunk of the administrator’s car is not secure off-site storage. (2) A conditioned environment
must be provided for the media, preferably an airtight, humidity-controlled, static-free storage
container. (3) Each media unit must be clearly labeled and write protected. (4) Because media
wears out, it is important to retire media units before they reach the end of their useful life.
Tape Backup and Recovery There is still value in tape backups as a cost-effective
method for organizations with large quantities of data. Traditionally, tape has been able to
store larger quantities of data in smaller containers. The most common types of tape media
include digital audio tapes (DATs), quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) drives, 8 mm tape, digital
linear tape (DLT), and Linear Tape Open (LTO). The media types differ in their capacities,
lifetimes, and performance characteristics, and a type will be chosen based on the capacity
and performance requirements of the organization’s backup processes.
The most common backup schedule is a daily on-site, incremental or differential backup, with
a weekly off-site full backup. Most backups are conducted during twilight hours, when sys-
tems activity is lowest and the probability of user interruption is limited. There are three clas-
sic methods for selecting which files to back up: six-tape rotation, Grandfather-Father-Son,
and the Towers of Hanoi.
Six-Tape Rotation Six-tape rotation, which rotates six sets of media, is perhaps the
most simple and well-known backup method. It uses five media sets per week (plus one set
for rotation off-site each week). Monday through Thursday, the organization performs a dif-
ferential or incremental backup. On Friday, a full backup is performed and stored off-site.
During the next week of backups, the organization uses the extra backup media set for the
Friday full backup and retrieves the previous Friday set for the upcoming week.
The six-tape rotation method offers roughly two weeks of recovery capability in a five-step
process. First, the organization attempts to recover the file(s) using the Monday through
Thursday tapes, if they are on hand. If the file that needs to be restored is not contained
within the backups that are on hand, the last full backup that was stored off site is retrieved
and the file(s) are recovered from that media. For additional ease of use and for redundancy,
an organization can make a copy of each full backup so that an on-site version can be kept
in the data center and an off-site set of full backup (Friday) tapes can be sent to the secure
storage location. This prevents the need to retrieve the off-site set.
Grandfather-Father-Son The Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) method uses five media
sets per week and allows recovery of data for the previous three weeks. Every second or
third month, a group of media sets is taken out of the cycle for permanent storage, and
a new set is brought in. This method equalizes the wear and tear on the tapes and helps to
prevent tape failure.

The Towers of Hanoi The Towers of Hanoi is a more complex approach than the other
two methods and uses statistical principles to optimize media wear. This 16-step strategy
assumes that five media sets are used per week, with a backup each night.
Selecting a Rotation Method Which rotation method is best? Table 11-1 lists the
advantages and disadvantages of each.
Online Backups and the Cloud One of the newest forms of data backup is online
backup to a third-party data storage vendor. Several backup software and service providers
now offer multi-terabyte online data storage available to anywhere, from anywhere. Even
for the home user, companies like Memeo (www.memeo.com), Dropbox (www.dropbox.
com), and Microsoft (Live Mesh 2011, at http://explore.live.com/windows-live-mesh) offer
data storage ranging from free 1 and 2 GB accounts to low-cost multi-gigabyte and multi-
terabyte solutions.
For the corporate user, this online data storage is sometimes referred to as storing data “in the
cloud”—as in “cloud computing,” in which organizations lease computing resources from a
third party. Many organizations also lease data storage from these cloud vendors. Cloud com-
puting usually takes one of three forms:
●
Software as a Service (SaaS)—Applications are provided at a fee but hosted on third-
party systems and accessed over the Internet (and the Web).
●
Platform as a Service (PaaS)—Development platforms are available to developers for a
fee and similarly hosted by third parties.
●
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—Unofficially known as Everything as a Service, this
provides hardware and operating systems resources to host whatever the organization
desires to implement, again hosted by a third party for a fee.
Rotation Method
Advantages
Disadvantages
Six-tape rotation
Requires only a few tapes, therefore an
easy and cheap rotation method; ideal
for small volumes of data (as much as
one tape can hold)
Keeps only a week’s worth of data unless you
regularly archive the full backup tapes
Grandfather-Father-Son
(GFS)
Provides the most secure data protection
and implements monthly archival of
tapes; a simple method that most
software supports
Requires more tapes, which can become
expensive
The Towers of Hanoi
Allows for easy full-system restorations
(no shuffling through tapes with partial
backups on them); ideal for small
businesses that wish to do full restores;
more cost effective than GFS (uses fewer
tapes)
Requires a rotation strategy that is not as
straightforward to implement as the other
rotation methods; unless your backup
software supports it, too complex to track
tape rotation manually; requires a time-
consuming full backup every session

Organizations can lease SaaS online backup services and receive data storage as part of the
package. From an ownership perspective, clouds can be public, community, private, or some
combination of the three:
●
Public clouds—The most common implementation, in which a third party makes the
services available to whoever needs them, over the Internet (and the Web).
●
Community clouds—A collaboration between a few entities for the sole benefit of
those entities.
●
Private clouds—An extension of the intranet applied to cloud computing. Though
technically negating the benefits of cloud computing (little or no capital investment), a
theoretical implementation could exist in which a parent company creates a cloud for
its own use and for its subordinate organizations’ use.
From a security perspective, the leasing of third-party services is always a challenge. If you
don’t own the hardware, software, and infrastructure, you can’t guarantee effective security,
so you must “warranty” it by scrutinizing the service agreement and insisting on minimal
standards of due care.
Threats to Stored Information
Most organizations understand the need to back up their information, but not all have
recognized the risks of storing backups. Backup media hold copies of much, if not all, of an
organization’s information assets, and they are commonly moved around outside the secured
confines of the data center—that is, transferred to a different data center, subsidiary, business
partner, or offsite storage facility. If these media are misplaced, this may constitute unautho-
rized disclosure of the information and trigger notifications required by CA SB 1386 and
other privacy legislation. Careful processes and the use of professional bonded couriers are
among various techniques that organizations can use to avoid the accidental loss of backup
media. New technologies, such as tape encryption, can also provide valuable protection for
externalized data.
Another risk derives from the persistent nature of backup media—once written, the data
remains until it is erased or overwritten with fresh data. Consider, for example, a magnetic
tape containing the backup of a sensitive database. When the contents of the backup are
replaced by newer backup data, it is a common practice to return the tape to the “scratch
pool,” where it is available for reuse. If the contents of the media are not erased before
being returned to the pool, their contents are still available on the tape and can be accessed
in violation of security policy. For this reason, it is a good practice to erase backup tapes
before returning them to the scratch pool.
Backup and Recovery Elapsed Time One of the drawbacks of tape backups is the
time required to store and retrieve information. Even differential or incremental backups to
tape can take some time to complete. For planning purposes, remember that it typically
requires at least twice as much time to restore information from backup media as it does to
produce the backup. This additional time is required because disks usually take longer to
write to than to read.
Redundancy-Based Protection Using RAID Another form of data protection,
redundant array of independent disks (RAID) systems, provides another method to ensure

that data is not lost. RAID is not a replacement for backup and recovery processes; instead,
it serves as a valuable complement to provide high availability for data. It uses a number of
hard drives to store information across multiple drive units. For operational redundancy,
this can spread out data and, when coupled with checksums, eliminate or reduce the impact
of a hard drive failure. There are many RAID configurations (called levels); the most com-
monly encountered ones are covered in the following sections.
The original title of Patterson, Gibson, and Katz’s 1988 paper had the
word “inexpensive” rather than “independent” to highlight the differ-
ences in cost between the expensive mainframe disks of the time and
the much less expensive mass market disks used in their RAID imple-
mentation. Eventually, this was changed to “independent.”
RAID Level 0 RAID 0 creates one larger logical volume across several available physical
hard disk drives and stores the data in segments, called stripes, across all the disk drives in
the array. This is often called disk striping without parity and is frequently used to combine
smaller drive volumes into fewer, larger volumes to gain the advantages that larger volumes
offer as well as increased I/O throughput. Unfortunately, the failure of one drive makes all
data inaccessible. In fact, RAID 0 does not improve the risk situation when using disk drives;
rather, it increases the risk of losing data from a single drive failure. Some RAID configura-
tions combine RAID 0 with RAID 5 or RAID 1 to provide both data protection and
improved I/O throughput.
RAID Level 1 Commonly called disk mirroring, RAID 1 uses two drives in which data is
written to both drives simultaneously, providing a backup if the primary drive fails. It is a
rather expensive and inefficient use of media. Mirroring is often used to create duplicate cop-
ies of operating system volumes for high-availability systems—for example, by splitting disk
mirrors to create highly available copies of critical system drives.
RAID Level 2 This is a specialized form of disk striping with parity and is not widely
used. (There are no commercial implementations.) It uses a specialized parity coding mecha-
nism known as the Hamming code to store stripes of data on multiple data drives and corre-
sponding redundant error correction on separate error-correcting drives. This approach
allows the reconstruction of data in the event that some of the data or redundant parity
information is lost.
RAID Levels 3 and 4 RAID 3 uses byte-level striping of data, and RAID 4 uses block-level
striping of data. These approaches use a process in which the data is stored in segments on
dedicated data drives and parity information is stored on a separate drive. As with RAID 0,
one large volume is used for the data, but the parity drive operates independently to provide
error recovery.
RAID Level 5 RAID 5 is most commonly used in organizations that balance safety and
redundancy against the costs of acquiring and operating the systems. It is similar to RAID 3
and 4 in that it stripes the data across multiple drives, but there is no dedicated parity drive.
Instead, segments of data are interleaved with parity data and are written across all the drives
in the set.
RAID Level 6 RAID 6 is very similar to RAID 5; however, this level adds another layer of
parity data striped across the drives. Having two blocks of parity data solves one problem

with RAID 5 in that RAID 6 protects against situations where a second drive fails before the
first drive has been recovered.
RAID Level 7 This is a proprietary variation on RAID 5 in which the array works as a sin-
gle virtual drive. RAID 7 is sometimes performed by running special software over RAID 5
hardware.
RAID Level 10 There are a number of ways to combine the various RAID methods into a
single hybrid system. One of the most popular is RAID 10 (also referred to as RAID 1+0),
which combines the benefits of RAID 0 and RAID 1. The data is striped like RAID 0,
but the striped set is mirrored, as in RAID 1. This hybrid system is really a mirror of a
striped set.
Some of the more common implementations of RAID are shown in Figure 11-6.
Database Backups
Systems that make use of databases—whether that database uses a hierarchical, relational, or
object-oriented technology—require special backup and recovery procedures. Depending on
the type of database and the software vendor, you may or may not be able to back up the
database with the utilities that are provided with the server operating systems. A further con-
sideration is whether system backup procedures can be used without interrupting the use of
the database. In most databases, a system backup can work correctly only if all user access
to the database is stopped (or quiesced). Using these databases while they are being backed

up requires additional backup tools. Administrators also need to know whether the database
being safeguarded is using special journal file systems, such as run-unit journals or after-
image journals that enable database concurrency functions. If these file systems and the files
they are built upon are not backed up properly, the backup tapes or disk images may be
unrecoverable when it comes time to restore the prior state of the system.
Application Backups
Some applications use file systems and databases in ways that invalidate the customary way
of doing backup and recovery. In some cases, applications write large binary objects as files
and manage pointers, and they handle internal data structures in ways that make routine
backups unable to handle the concurrency or complexity of the application. Make sure that
members of the application support and development teams are part of the planning process
when these systems’ backup plans are made, and that these team members are included in
training, testing, and rehearsal activities.
Real-Time Protection, Server Recovery, and Application Recovery Some
data protection strategies seek to improve the robustness of a server or system in addition
to or instead of performing data backups. One approach that provides real-time protection
as well as data backup is the use of mirroring. Mirroring provides duplication of server
data storage by using multiple hard drive volumes, as described earlier. RAID 1 can be
achieved with software or hardware, writing data to other drives, even if they are located
on other systems. This mirroring concept can be extended to vaulting and journaling,
which are discussed later in this chapter.
One way to implement server recovery and redundancy through mirroring servers uses hot,
warm, and cold servers. In this strategy, the online primary server is the hot server, which pro-
vides the services necessary to support operations. The warm server serves as an ancillary or
secondary server that services requests when the primary server is busy or down. The cold
server is the administrator’s test platform, and it should be identically configured to the hot
and warm servers.
Before a patch, upgrade, or new application is applied to the hot and warm servers, it is first
tested on the cold server. Should the hot server go down, the warm server automatically takes
over as the hot server, and the cold server can be used as the new warm server while the hot
server is taken offline for repair.
Recent advances in server recovery have developed bare metal recovery technologies designed
to replace operating systems and services when they fail. These applications allow you to
reboot the affected system from a CD-ROM or other remote drive and quickly restore your
operating system by providing images backed up from a known stable state. Linux and
UNIX have been able to use boot CDs such as Knoppix or Helix for some time; Microsoft
developed its Preinstallation Environment (Win PE) to provide similar capabilities. Use of
bare metal recovery applications, in conjunction with routine backups, allows the recovery of
entire servers quickly and easily.
Another option for online backup and application availability is server clustering. Clustering
works similarly to the hot/warm server model described earlier. The simpler clustering model
is active/passive clustering in which two identically configured servers share access to the
application data storage. At any point in time, only the active server is controlling the storage

and responding to requests. If the active server crashes or hangs, the passive server takes con-
trol of the application storage and begins servicing requests.
Active/active clustering is a more complex model in which all members of a cluster simulta-
neously provide application services. As noted earlier, mirroring of data, whether through the
use of RAID 1 or alternative technologies, can increase the reliability of primary systems and
also enhance the effectiveness of business resumption strategies. Vaulting and journaling dra-
matically increase the level of protection. They are discussed in the sections that follow.
Electronic Vaulting The bulk transfer of data in batches to an off-site facility is called
electronic vaulting (see Figure 11-7). It is usually conducted via dedicated network links or
data communications services that are provided for a fee. The receiving server archives the
data as it is received. Some disaster recovery companies specialize in electronic vaulting ser-
vices. The primary criteria for selecting an electronic vaulting (or e-vaulting) solution are the
cost of the service and the required bandwidth. If the organization does not currently have
enough bandwidth to support e-vaulting, it must select a vendor to obtain the additional
bandwidth needed.12
Electronic vaulting can be more expensive than tape backup and slower than data mirroring,
so it should be used only for data that warrants the additional expense, such as critical
transactional data and customer databases. Although e-vaulting can be performed over
public infrastructure, the data must be encrypted while in transit, which can slow the data
transfer rate.

For managed solutions from vendors, typically a software agent is installed on all servers to be
included in the e-vaulting process. Once installed, the software initiates a full backup of data
to the remote vault and then prepares to continuously copy data as it is created or modified.
The vendor is then responsible for the maintenance and protection of the data. Data can be
accessed via a Web interface or by using installed software to facilitate restoration or valida-
tion of transferred data. Different applications can facilitate the transfer among organization-
ally owned equipment over public or private communications links for an organization that
wants to transfer data to its own vault.
Remote Journaling Remote journaling (RJ) is the transfer of live transactions to an
off-site facility. RJ was developed by IBM in 1999 for its AS/400 V4R2 operating system.
RJ differs from electronic vaulting in that only transaction data is transferred, not archived
data, and the transfer is performed online and much closer to real time. Although electronic
vaulting is much like a traditional backup, with a dump of data to the off-site storage,
remote journaling involves online activities on a systems level, much like server fault toler-
ance, in which data is written to two locations simultaneously or asynchronously, as pre-
ferred. RJ facilitates the recovery of key transactions nearly in real time. Figure 11-8 shows
an overview of the remote journaling process.
When journaling is enabled, the operating system initiates a process that creates a record of
changes to the object being journaled. These changes are recorded as a journal entry, which
is stored in a journal receiver, similar to storing a record in a database file. Once the journal

receiver is full or reaches a preset level, a new journal receiver is linked to the journal, and the
full receiver is available for storage.
To recover data, the stored receivers can be pulled from tape and applied to the data in the
production database, restoring the data to a known stable point. Remote journaling involves
the transferring of journal entries to a remote journal, which in turn stores them to a remote
journal receiver. This remote journal receiver is transferred to remote tape or other storage
when full, creating a virtual real-time backup of the entries.14
Database Shadowing Database shadowing is the propagation of transactions to a
remote copy of the database. It combines electronic vaulting with remote journaling, apply-
ing transactions to the database simultaneously in two separate locations. This technology
can be used with multiple databases on a single drive in a single system or with databases
in remote locations across a public or private carrier, as shown in Figure 11-9.
Shadowing techniques are generally used by organizations needing immediate data recovery
after an incident or disaster. The “shadowed” database is available for reading as well as writ-
ing and thus serves as a dynamic off-site backup. According to E-Net, a company that pro-
vides mainframe software solutions for business continuity and disaster recovery, database
shadowing also works well for read-only functions, such as the following:

Network-Attached Storage and Storage Area Networks
Two other advances in data storage and recovery are network-attached storage (NAS) and
storage area networks (SANs). NAS is usually implemented via a single device or server that
attaches to a network. It uses common communications methods—such as Windows file
sharing, NFS, CIFS, HTTP directories, or FTP—to provide an online storage environment.
Often used for additional storage, NAS is configured to allow users or groups of users to
access data storage.
NAS does not work well with real-time applications because of the latency of the communi-
cation methods. For general file sharing or data backup, NAS provides a less expensive solu-
tion. For high-speed and higher-security solutions, SANs may be preferable.
SANs are similar in concept but differ in implementation. NAS uses TCP/IP-based protocols
and communications methods; SANs use fibre-channel or iSCSI connections between the sys-
tems needing the additional storage and the storage devices themselves. This difference is
shown in Figure 11-10 and described in Table 11-2.16

Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
When an organization is making arrangements for off-site IT support options, the terms and
conditions of that site should be made known to all parties by negotiating and executing a
service agreement. Service level agreements (SLAs) are the contractual documents guarantee-
ing certain minimum levels of service provided by vendors.
An effective service agreement should contain the following sections:
1.
Definition of applicable parties—Identifies whom the document applies to
2.
Services to be provided by the vendor—Specifies exactly what the client is to receive in
exchange for the payments
3.
Fees and payments for these services—Specifies what the vendor receives in exchange
for the services rendered
4.
Statements of indemnification—Declares that the vendor is not liable for actions taken
by the client
5.
Nondisclosure agreements and intellectual property assurances—Obligates the vendor to
protect the confidentiality of the client’s information from everyone except authorized
law enforcement officials and parties that serve legal papers directing the vendor to pro-
vide such information
6.
Noncompetitive agreements (covenant not to compete)—States that the client will not
use the vendor’s services to compete directly with the vendor and that the client will
not use vendor information to gain a better deal with another vendor
Organizations strive for near-perfect availability. Availability is usually expressed as the per-
centage of time that systems are available over a specific period of time, after allowing for
planned maintenance times. Perfect uptime is not realistically achievable. Errors and mistakes
happen, and even when allowances are made for planned maintenance, most organizations
rely on external vendors for Internet service, power, and other services, and these will have
outages from time to time.
When service levels are measured, they are commonly reported as a series of nines. As a
frame of reference, most organizations feel that uptime less than 99.9 percent for data (often
called three nines availability) and 99.99 for voice communications (four nines availability) is
unacceptable. That means that most organizations consider acceptable downtime (outside of
planned maintenance times) for a data network to be 10.1 minutes or less per week. The
voice network cannot be unavailable for more than 1 minute per week.

Incident Response Plan
Although DR and BC are equally important to an organization, your primary focus, with
regard to networking, will be on IR planning and on operations to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of data both on the network and stored on networking devices. The
remainder of this chapter examines the details of the IR plan.
As indicated earlier, unexpected activities occur periodically and are referred to as events. In
CP, an event that indicates a threat to the security of the organization’s information is called
an incident. An incident occurs when an attack (natural or human-made) affects resources
and/or assets, causing disclosure, damage, or other disruptions. A computer incident occurs
when an attack affects information resources and/or assets, causing actual damage or other
disruptions.
Incident response (IR), then, is a set of procedures that commences when an incident is
detected. IR must be carefully planned and coordinated, because organizations heavily depend
on the quick and efficient containment and resolution of incidents. As was noted earlier in this
chapter, the IR plan comprises a detailed set of processes and procedures that anticipate,
detect, and mitigate the effects of an unexpected situation that might compromise information
resources and assets. Incident response planning (IRP), therefore, is the preparation for such a
situation. The three-step model that NIST recommends for CP operations (described earlier)
can also be used to describe IR functions. Figure 11-11 shows that NIST defines the IR execu-
tion process based on a different standard. As mentioned earlier, the two are similar in func-
tion, with the latter mostly focused on IR rather than general CP operations. Figure 11-12
provides a slightly broader perspective, showing how the Computer Emergency Response
Team Coordinating Center (CERT/CC) approach to IR planning fits into its overall IR
model.
When the CPMT completes the BIA, it begins to transfer the information gleaned from the
organization to the various subordinate committees. To assist in their subordinate planning,
the IR, DR, and BC committees are given some overlapping information on the attacks they
could face. They must also extract information from the organization’s periodic risk assess-
ments, provided the organization conducts them on a regular basis. In addition, the subordinate
planning committees get as much of the overall contingency plan as has been completed. Once
subordinate team members have this information, they begin to formulate their subordinate

plans. In the case of IR planning, the group conducts its portion of the overall CP methodol-
ogy described in Figure 11-4, focusing on the following stages (described in the following
sections):
●
Form the IR planning teams.
●
Develop IR planning policy.
●
Integrate the BIA.
●
Identify preventive controls unique to IR.
●
Organize the Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT).
●
Create IR contingency strategies.
●
Develop the IR plan.
●
Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises.
●
Ensure plan maintenance.
Some of these stages involve work conducted exclusively by the IR team; other stages may
involve other subordinate teams. The latter two stages, especially, may be conducted by the
IR team by itself, but at some point the organization should invest in joint CP operations
training and exercises.
Form IR Planning Team
The IRP process begins with staffing the IR planning team. Much of the preliminary organiz-
ing effort is done by the CPMT, but the IR team needs to be organized as a separate entity,
and that begins by identifying and engaging a collection of stakeholders—that is, a represen-
tative collection of individuals with a stake in the successful and uninterrupted operation of
the organization’s information infrastructure. These stakeholders are used to collect vital
information on the roles and responsibilities of the actual response team. Stakeholders
include representatives from general management, IT management, information security man-
agement and operations, and other specialized groups such as legal affairs, public relations,
and customer support.

Develop IR Planning Policy
One of the first projects to be undertaken by the IR planning committee should be the IRP
policy, which defines the IR-related roles and responsibilities for the Computer Security Inci-
dent Response Team (CSIRT) and for others who will be mobilized in the activation of the
plan. A CSIRT is the team—either dedicated staff or virtual team—responsible for incident
response and handling. The following list from NIST’s Computer Security Incident Handling
Guide provides a structural overview of a typical IR policy:19
●
Statement of management commitment
●
Purpose and objectives of the policy
●
Scope of the policy (to whom and what it applies and under what circumstances)
●
Definition of information security incidents and their consequences within the context
of the organization
●
Organizational structure and delineation of roles, responsibilities, and levels of
authority; should include the authority of the IR team to confiscate or disconnect
equipment and to monitor suspicious activity, and the requirements for reporting cer-
tain types of incidents
●
Prioritization or severity ratings of incidents
●
Performance measures
●
Reporting and contact forms
IR policy must gain the full support of top management and must be clearly understood by
all affected parties. It is especially important to gain the support of those communities of
interest that will be required to alter business practices or make changes to their information
technology infrastructures.
The responsibility for creating an organization’s IR plan usually falls to the chief information
security officer (CISO). Planning for an incident and the responses to it requires a detailed
understanding of the information systems and the threats they face. The IR planning team
and CSIRT (defined later in this chapter) seek to develop a series of predefined responses
that will guide the team and information security staff through the IR steps. Predefining IRs
enables the organization to react to a detected incident quickly and effectively, without con-
fusion or wasted time and effort.
Integrate the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
To determine these predefined responses, the IR planning committee must first identify poten-
tially successful attacks and understand the possible outcomes of these attacks. This is a
three-stage process:
1.
Threat Attack Identification and Prioritization—In this stage, organizations update the
prioritized threat list created during the risk assessment process and add an attack pro-
file, which is a detailed description of the activities that occur during an attack, includ-
ing the preliminary indications of the attack as well as the actions taken and the
outcome.
2.
Attack Success Scenario Development—Next, the BIA team creates a series of scenarios
depicting the effects of an occurrence of each threat on each prioritized functional area.

Attack success scenarios are added to the attack profile, including alternative outcomes:
best, worst, and most likely to occur.
3.
Potential Damage Assessment—From these detailed scenarios, the IRP team must esti-
mate the cost of the best, worst, and most likely outcomes by preparing an attack sce-
nario end case, which identifies the costs associated with recovering from each possible
case. For every attack scenario end case, the IR team creates the incident plan, which is
made up of three sets of incident-handling procedures to be deployed during, after, and
before the incident.
Identify Preventive Controls Unique to IR
The next step is to identify (and evaluate) the preventive controls that are currently in place
and protecting critical assets, from an IR perspective. An effective risk assessment involves
an asset inventory and prioritization. This information, along with the information from the
BIA, should give the team a head start in determining if the controls currently implemented
are effective. If the risk management team is doing its job, this phase may simply consist of
reviewing the most recent report and ensuring that it is current. Note that some assets protect
the organization from both incidents and disaster. It’s a matter of scale. A small fire is an
incident; a large fire is a disaster. Good fire suppression equipment can protect against both.
Thus, it is especially important for all subordinate teams to collaborate in this area, sharing
information on preventive controls and safeguards.
Organize the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), which is also known as the Security
Incident Response Team (SIRT), is the group of individuals who would be expected to
respond to a detected incident. The selection of CIRT personnel should be based on the skills
and access privileges needed to quickly and effectively react to a given situation. Different
CSIRT subteams can be formed based on the type and scope of the incident. The organization
may well have different teams to react to different incidents. Care should be taken to ensure
that critical skills necessary for other CP activities, like DR or BC, are balanced between the
IR, DR, and BC activities. It is conceivable that all three could be conducted concurrently.
Once the organization has staffed the CSIRT, training begins. Training computer IR team
members can be conducted in various ways. There are several national training programs
that focus on IR tools and techniques. The SANS Institute offers a number of classes and cer-
tifications designed to train the information security professional (see www.sans.org), includ-
ing ones related to IR. SANS even has a set of conferences—SANS Forensics and Incident
Response Education (SANSFIRE)—that specifically focuses on IR. In addition to formal
external training, the organization can set up its own training program in which more experi-
enced staff members share their knowledge with less-experienced employees. An ongoing
training program should include this mentoring-type training to prevent a loss of organiza-
tional knowledge when certain employees depart.
Create IR Contingency Strategies
As the team moves its attention to the actual activities performed by organizational person-
nel, including CSIRT members, it needs to decide exactly how it plans to respond to various
incidents. This is an area in which some of the work must be done by the CPMT, given that
budgetary decisions could be very wide reaching. There are also strategies that benefit or

impact more than one subordinate group. Contingency (or response) strategies vary greatly,
both in their effectiveness in responding to an attack and in their impact upon the organiza-
tion. If an organization automatically severs its Internet connection every time it is scanned
by an outside entity, odds are it will not be in business long.
Some organizations may choose to have a single IR strategy in place for all incidents. Others
may choose to have several optional plans to handle different circumstances. Here are a num-
ber of factors that influence the IR strategy that an organization decides to use:
●
Are the affected systems impacting profitable operations?
●
If information was stolen, what was the level of sensitivity or classification?
●
Which business functions are being impacted, and at what level?
●
Has the incident been contained, or is it continuing?
●
What is the origin of the emergency? Is it internal or external to the organization?
●
Is the incident public knowledge?
●
What are the legal reporting requirements? Does the law require this matter to be
reported immediately to authorities? Who are those authorities? Should this matter be
handled as a human resources function? Should this matter be handled as a civil suit?
●
What, if any, steps should be immediately taken to discover the identity of an outside-
agency attacker?
●
As of the moment the incident is contained, what are the financial losses?
●
Should the organization involve law enforcement? 20
Two general categories of strategic approaches are protect and forget strategies, which are
the simplest, and apprehend and prosecute, which require a greater and more complex
effort.21 The response to the incident is the same regardless of which strategy is employed,
but the data collection tasks differ dramatically.
Protect and forget strategies focus on the detection, logging, and analysis of events for the
purpose of determining how they happened and preventing reoccurrence. Once the current
incident is over, who caused it or why is immaterial except insofar as it is relevant to the pre-
vention of future incidents. Apprehend and prosecute strategies focus on the identification
and apprehension of the intruder (if a human threat-agent is involved), with additional atten-
tion given to the collection and preservation of potential evidentiary materials that might sup-
port administrative or criminal prosecution.
The key steps used in both strategies are shown in Table 11-3.
Develop the Incident Response (IR) Plan
Once the organization’s IRP team has progressed to this point, it begins developing the actual
IR plan. The IR plan can be broken into the following four general sections:
1.
Identification
2.
Response
3.
Containment and Eradication
4.
Recovery

Identification The identification of an incident begins with the trigger—that is, the
circumstances that cause the IR team to be activated and the IR plan to be initiated. This
trigger could be any of a number of situations or circumstances, including the following:
●
A phone call from a user to the help desk about unusual computer or network
behavior
●
Notification from a systems administrator about unusual server or network behavior
●
Notification from an intrusion detection device
●
Review of system log files indicating unusual pattern of entries

Other specific identifiable situations that result in the invocation of the IR plan
The IR team’s lead person, also known as the IR duty officer, determines when the IR plan
must be activated. A duty officer is a CSIRT team member, other than the team leader, who
is on call for purposes of responding to an incident report.
Data Collection The routine collection and analysis of data is required to properly detect
and declare incidents. Even if an incident is not detected in real time, the data collected by
automatic recording systems assist the teams in better understanding the normal and routine
operations of the systems that process, transmit, and store information. Understanding nor-
mal operations assists in detecting abnormal operations. The information that should nor-
mally be collected is presented in Table 11-4.

Incident Response Plan Activation Among the earliest challenges IR planners face is
determining how to classify events as they occur. Some events are the product of routine sys-
tem activities, whereas others are indicators of situations that require an urgent response.
Incident classification is the process of evaluating organizational events, determining which
events are possible incidents, also called incident candidates, and then determining whether
or not the incident candidate is an actual incident or a nonevent, also called a false positive
incident candidate.
Designing the process used to make this judgment is the role of the IR design team; the pro-
cess of actually classifying an event is the responsibility of the IR team. Some organizations
have a single incident center where all incident candidates are sent as soon as they are recog-
nized. Others have geographically separate review locations, perhaps based on time zones,
wherein preliminary determinations about the status of an incident candidate can be assessed.
Still other organizations handle incident candidate evaluation by business unit, product line,
or some other criterion.22
Incident candidates can be detected and tracked via a variety of sources: end users, intrusion
detection systems, virus management software, systems administrators, and so forth. Careful
training in incident candidate reporting allows end users, the help desk staff, and security
personnel to relay vital information to the IR team.
Classifying Incidents A number of different events can signal the presence of an incident
candidate. Unfortunately, these same events may occur when a system becomes overloaded,
encounters an error, or through a normal operation that mimics an incident candidate. To
help make the detection of actual incidents more reliable, D. L. Pipkin has identified three
broad categories of incident indicators: possible, probable, and definite.23 This categorization
enables an organization to expedite the decision-making process of incident classification and
ensure that the proper IR plan is activated as early as possible.
Possible Indicators of an Incident The four types of possible actual incidents are:
●
Presence of unfamiliar files—Users might discover unfamiliar files in their home direc-
tories or on their office computers. Administrators might find files that are not in a
logical location or owned by an authorized user.

●
Presence or execution of unknown programs or processes—Users or administrators
might detect unfamiliar programs running, or processes executing, on office machines
or network servers.
●
Unusual consumption of computing resources—Memory consumption or hard disk
usage might suddenly spike or fall. Many computer operating systems, including Win-
dows, Mac OS, Linux, and many UNIX variants, allow users and administrators to
monitor CPU and memory consumption. Most computers also have the ability to mon-
itor hard drive space. In addition, servers maintain logs of file creation and storage.
●
Unusual system crashes—Older operating systems running newer programs are noto-
rious for locking up or spontaneously rebooting whenever the operating system is
unable to execute a requested process or service. You are probably familiar with sys-
tems error messages such as “Unrecoverable Application Error,” “General Protection
Fault,” and the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death. However, if a computer
system seems to be crashing, hanging, rebooting, or freezing more frequently than
usual, the cause could be an incident candidate.
Probable Indicators of an Incident Pipkin identifies four types of probable indicators
of actual incidents:
●
Activities at unexpected times—If traffic levels on an organization’s network exceed
the baseline values, an incident candidate is probably present. If this activity surge
occurs when few members of the organization are at work, the probability becomes
much greater. Similarly, if systems are accessing drives, such as floppy and CD-ROM
drives, in the absence of user actions, an incident may also be occurring.
●
Presence of new accounts—The presence of an account (or accounts) that the admin-
istrator did not create or that are not logged in the administrator’s journal signal an
incident candidate. An unlogged new account with root or other special privileges has
an even higher probability of being an actual incident.
●
Reported attacks—If users of the system report a suspected attack, there is a high
probability that an attack has occurred, which constitutes an incident. The technical
sophistication of the person making the report should be considered.
●
Notification from IDS—If the organization has installed and correctly configured a
host- or network-based intrusion detection system (IDS), then notification from the
IDS indicates that an incident might be in progress. However, IDSs are seldom con-
figured optimally and, even when they are, tend to issue many false positives or false
alarms. The administrator must determine whether the notification indicates an inci-
dent or is the result of a routine operation by a user or other administrator.
Definite Indicators of an Incident There are five types of definite indicators of an
actual incident—that is, indicators that clearly and definitively signal that an incident is in
progress or has occurred. In these cases, the IR plan must be activated immediately.
●
Use of dormant accounts—Many network servers maintain default accounts, and
quite often accounts exist from former employees, employees on a leave of absence or
sabbatical without remote access privileges, or dummy accounts set up to support
system testing. If any of these accounts begins accessing system resources, querying
servers, or engaging in other activities, an incident is almost certain to have occurred.

●
Modified or missing logs—Log records are a valuable source of information, particu-
larly when centralized for purposes of consolidation and analysis. Unfortunately,
attackers are well aware of this value and often delete or modify log records to con-
ceal their activities. For this reason, unexplained gaps in records or modifications to
records are definite indicators of an incident.
●
Presence of hacker tools—Network administrators sometimes use system vulnerability
and network evaluation tools to scan internal computers and networks to determine
what a hacker can see. These tools are also used to support research into attack pro-
files. Too often the tools are used by employees, contractors, or outsiders with local
network access to hack into systems. To combat this problem, many organizations
explicitly prohibit the use of these tools without written permission from the CISO,
making any unauthorized installation a policy violation. Therefore, if unauthorized
hacker tools are detected on a system, an incident has occurred.
●
Notifications by partner or peer—If a business partner or another connected organi-
zation reports an attack from your computing systems, then an incident has occurred.
●
Notification by hacker—Some hackers enjoy taunting their victims. If an organiza-
tion’s Web pages are defaced, it is an incident. If an organization receives an extortion
request for money in exchange for its customers’ credit card files, an incident is in
progress.
Additional Incident Indicators The following additional events indicate that an incident
is underway:
●
Loss of availability—Information or information systems become unavailable.
●
Loss of integrity—Users report corrupt data files, garbage where data should be, or
data that just looks wrong.
●
Loss of confidentiality—You are notified of sensitive information leaks, or informa-
tion you thought was protected has been disclosed.
●
Violation of policy—If organizational policies addressing information or information
security have been violated, an incident has occurred.
●
Violation of law—If the law has been broken and the organization’s information
assets are involved, an incident has occurred.
Identification Triage An important role of the IR duty officer is to talk to the incident
reporter and triage the information presented. Many organizations will design a script to
help the duty officer triage the situation during the report and determine how best to
respond. The script will include questions like:
●
What symptoms or information did you witness?
●
When did you detect the event?
●
What was happening on the system when the event occurred?
●
What actions were you performing on the system when the event occurred?
●
Whom else did you notify, or with whom did you discuss the event?
●
What actions did you take once the events were identified?

Challenges in Incident Identification It should be painfully obvious by this point that
the detection of incidents can be a tedious and technically demanding process. Only those with
advanced technical skills in a certain set of hardware and software can manually detect signs of
an intrusion through reviews of logs, system performance, user feedback, and system processes
and tasks. This underscores the value of two key facets of incident detection: (1) effective use of
technology to assist in detection, and (2) the necessity of cooperation between IR and informa-
tion security professionals and the entire IT department. The former is discussed in detail in
Chapter 6. As for the latter, the IT staff is best prepared to understand the day-to-day opera-
tions of the hardware, software, and networking components that support organizational
operations on an ongoing basis. It can work with the CSIRT and information security teams
to identify anomalies in the system’s performance and administration. This should underscore
the necessity to integrate IT systems and network administrators as part of CSIRT operations.
Response The next IR plan component is the determination of what must be done to
react to a particular situation. An organization may have spent great effort in developing
an IR Plan (IRP is IR Planning) yet still be unprepared when an incident occurs. It is not
enough to simply prepare plans; it is necessary to alter the culture of the organization to
make the organization more responsive and resilient when incidents occur. The best plans
may not necessarily be the most thorough or most elaborate; the best plans are those that
improve the outcome when an incident occurs. How and when to activate IR plans is deter-
mined by the IR strategy the organization chooses to pursue. Whether a one-size-fits-all IR
strategy or a more complex and responsive multipart approach is chosen, the organization
must make sure the outcome from the planned response meets the organization’s strategic
and tactical needs.
Notification As soon as the IR team determines that an incident is in progress, the right
people must be immediately notified in the right order. Most response organizations, such as
firefighters or the military, maintain an alert roster for all emergencies. An alert roster is a
document containing contact information for the individuals that need to be notified in the
event of an incident.
There are two ways to activate an alert roster: sequentially and hierarchically. A sequential
roster requires that a contact person call each and every person on the roster. A hierarchical
roster requires one person to call certain other people, who in turn call other people, and so
on. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. The hierarchical system is quicker,
because more people are calling at the same time, but the message can become distorted as
it is passed from person to person. The sequential system is more accurate, but it is also
slower because a single contact person provides each responder with the message.
The alert message is a scripted description of the incident that consists of just enough infor-
mation so that each CSIRT responder knows what portion of the IR plan to implement with-
out impeding the notification process. It is important to recognize that not everyone is on the
alert roster; only those individuals who must respond to a specific actual incident are on it.
As with any part of the IR plan, the alert roster must be regularly maintained, tested, and
rehearsed if it is to remain effective.

During this phase, other key personnel not on the alert roster, such as general management, must
be notified of the incident as well. This notification should occur after the incident has been con-
firmed but before media or other external sources learn of it. In addition, some incidents are dis-
closed to the employees in general, as a lesson in security, and some are not, as a measure of
security. Furthermore, other organizations may need to be notified if it is determined that the
incident is not confined to internal information resources or if the incident is part of a larger-
scale assault. For example, during Mafiaboy’s distributed denial-of-service attack on multiple
high-visibility Web-based vendors in late 1999, many of the target organizations reached out
for help. In general, the IR planners should determine in advance whom to notify and when,
and should offer guidance about additional notification steps to take as needed.
Documenting an Incident As soon as an incident has been confirmed and the notifi-
cation process is under way, the team should begin to document it. The documentation
should record the who, what, when, where, why, and how of each action taken while the
incident is occurring. This documentation serves as a case study after the fact to determine
whether the right actions were taken and if they were effective. It also proves, should it
become necessary, that the organization did everything possible to prevent the spread of the
incident. Legally, the standards of due care protect the organization should an incident
adversely affect individuals inside and outside the organization or other organizations that
use the target organization’s systems. Incident documentation can also be used as a simula-
tion in future training sessions on future versions of the IR plan.
Interviewing Individuals Involved in the Incident Part of determining the scale,
scope, and impact of an incident is the collection of information from those reporting the
incident and responsible for the systems impacted by the incident. This can be potentially
dangerous when you consider that one of the individuals interviewed during IR may in fact
be the cause of the incident.
Interviews involve three groups of stakeholders: end users, help desk personnel, and systems
administrators. Each group can provide a different perspective on the incident as well as
clues to its origin, cause, and impact. Interviews with end users require the CSIRT to collect
information in a manner that does not intimidate them or overwhelm them with technical
jargon and questions.
The interview should make the user feel that he or she is contributing to the IR effort. Inter-
views with the help desk tend to be more technical, intense, and often seek information
beyond that gained from the one or two individual users who initially contacted the help
desk. Interviewers frequently ask the help desk staff to review previous trouble tickets look-
ing for signs of similar attacks that could indicate a previous incident or attempted incident
by the same attacker. Interviews with systems administrators similarly seek additional infor-
mation—specifically, logs from the affected systems and possibly online or offline forensic
images to be analyzed in a lab.
Containment/Eradication One of the most critical components of the IR plan is
stopping the incident or containing its impact. Incident containment strategies vary
depending on the incident and on the amount of damage caused. Before an incident can
be stopped or contained, however, the affected areas must be identified. During an inci-
dent is not the time to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected areas; those tasks are typ-
ically performed after the fact, in the forensics process. Instead, simple identification of

what information and systems are involved determines the containment actions to be
taken. Incident containment strategies focus on two tasks: stopping the incident and recov-
ering control of the affected systems.
The CSIRT team can attempt to stop the incident and try to recover control by means of sev-
eral strategies. If the incident originates outside the organization, the simplest and most
straightforward approach is to disconnect the affected communication circuits. Of course, if
the organization’s lifeblood runs through that circuit, this step may be too drastic; if the inci-
dent does not threaten critical functional areas, it may be more feasible to monitor the inci-
dent and contain it another way. One approach used by some organizations is to dynamically
apply filtering rules to limit certain types of network access. For example, if a threat agent is
attacking a network by exploiting a vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Proto-
col (SNMP), then applying a blocking filter for the commonly used IP ports for that vulnera-
bility stops the attack without compromising other services on the network. Depending on the
nature of the attack and the organization’s technical capabilities, ad hoc controls can some-
times allow an organization to gain valuable time to devise a more permanent control strat-
egy. Other containment strategies include the following:
●
Disabling compromised user accounts
●
Reconfiguring a firewall to block the problem traffic
●
Temporarily disabling the compromised process or service
●
Taking down the conduit application or server—for example, the e-mail server
●
Stopping all computers and network devices
Obviously, that last strategy is used only when all system control has been lost and the only
hope is to preserve the data stored on the computers so that operations can resume normally
once the incident is resolved. The IR team, following the procedures outlined in the IR plan,
determines the length of the interruption.
Recovery Once an incident has been contained and system control has been regained, inci-
dent recovery can begin. As in the Response phase, the first task is to inform the appropriate
human resources. Almost simultaneously, the CSIRT must assess the full extent of the damage
to determine what must be done to restore the systems. Each individual involved should begin
recovery operations based on the appropriate incident recovery section of the IR plan.
The immediate determination of the scope of the breach of confidentiality, integrity, and avail-
ability of information and information assets is called incident damage assessment. Incident
damage assessment can take days or weeks, depending on the extent of the damage. The
damage can range from minor (a curious hacker snooped around) to severe (the infection of
hundreds of computer systems by a worm or virus). System logs, intrusion detection logs, con-
figuration logs, as well as the documentation from the IR provide information on the type,
scope, and extent of damage. Using this information, the CSIRT assesses the current state of
the information and systems and compares it to a known state. Individuals who document
the damage from actual incidents must be trained to collect and preserve evidence in case the
incident is part of a crime or results in a civil action.
The following sections detail the appropriate steps to be taken in the recovery process.

Identify and Resolve Vulnerabilities Although it may appear simple, identifying and
resolving vulnerabilities could prove to be a major challenge in reestablishing operations.
Forensics analysis, used both as a tool for intrusion analysis and evidentiary purposes, can
also help organizations best assess how the incident occurred and what vulnerabilities were
exploited. In some cases, such as disasters, computer forensics may not be necessary, but
when hackers, worms, and other systems violations are involved, organizations can benefit
greatly from better understanding exactly what occurred.
However, if the incident data is to be used in legal proceedings, it is imperative that the indi-
viduals performing the forensic collection and analysis be trained to recognize and handle the
material in such a way that does not violate its value as evidence in civil or criminal
proceedings.
After any incident, address the safeguards that failed to stop or limit the incident, or were
missing from the system in the first place, and install, replace, or upgrade them. Whether the
result of a faulty, malfunctioning, or misconfigured network security device (such as a fire-
wall, router, or VPN connection) or a breach in policy or data protection procedures, the
safeguards that were already in place must be examined to determine if they were part of
the incident. If the incident was due to a missing safeguard, an assessment as to why the safe-
guard was not in place should be conducted. It may be determined that the incident occurred
because a planned safeguard had not been procured yet, or it may be determined that a safe-
guard that could have prevented or limited the incident was assessed as being unnecessary.
Evaluate monitoring capabilities, if present. Improve detection and reporting methods, or install
new monitoring capabilities. Many organizations do not have automated intrusion detection
systems. Some feel that the performance does not justify the cost, especially when perceptions
of “it can’t happen to me” cloud the judgment of those responsible for the recommendation.
Unfortunately, some decision makers must witness firsthand or secondhand the damage,
destruction, or loss caused by an incident before they are willing to commit to the expenses of
intrusion monitoring. This is especially unfortunate because in some cases, open-source software
can provide many of the capabilities needed with little or no additional hardware or software
expense (for example, Snort, found at www.snort.org). Although each set of circumstances
needs to be carefully analyzed, in many cases the expense of training staff and providing sup-
port for open-source solutions is much less than replacing existing proprietary solutions.
If you don’t have monitoring capabilities, get them. If you have them, review the implementa-
tion and configuration to determine if they failed to detect the incident. Network or host
IDSs won’t detect all incidents, especially attacks that are not network based. Burglar and
fire alarm systems are also needed to detect physical forms of incidents.
Restore Data The CSIRT must understand the backup strategy used by the organization,
restore the data contained in backups and then use the appropriate recovery processes from
incremental backups or database journals to recreate any data that was created or modified
since the last backup, as described previously.
Restore Services and Processes Compromised services and processes must be examined,
verified, and then restored. If services or processes were interrupted in the course of regaining
control of the systems, they need to be brought back online.
Continuously monitor the system. If an incident happened once, it could easily happen again.
Hackers frequently boast of their exploits in chat rooms and dare their peers to match their

efforts. If word gets out, others may be tempted to try the same or different attacks on your
systems. It is, therefore, important to maintain vigilance during the entire IR process.
Restore Confidence across the Organization The CSIRT may wish to issue a short
memorandum outlining the incident and assuring all that the incident was handled and the
damage was controlled. If the incident was minor, say so. If the incident was major or
severely damaged systems or data, reassure the users that they can expect operations to
return to normal as soon as possible. The objective of this communication is to prevent
panic or confusion from causing additional disruption to the operations of the organization.
After Action Review (AAR) Before returning to its routine duties, the CSIRT must con-
duct one last process, the after-action review (AAR). The after-action review entails a detailed
examination of the events that occurred from first detection to final recovery. All key players
review their notes and verify that the IR documentation is accurate and precise. All team mem-
bers review the actions taken during the incident and identify areas where the IR plan worked,
didn’t work, or should improve. This exercise allows the team to update the IR plan. AARs are
conducted with all role players in attendance. The CSIRT team leader presents a timeline of
events and highlights who was involved at each stage, with a summary of their actions.
Ideally, each involved person relates what he or she discovered or did, and any discrepancies
between documentation and the verbal case are noted. The entire AAR is recorded for use as
a training case for future staff. All parties should treat the AAR not as an inquisition but as a
discussion group. If properly structured and conducted, the AAR can have a positive effect
on the organization’s IR capacity and employee confidence in responding to incidents. If
poorly handled, the AAR can actually reduce the organization’s ability to react because indi-
viduals, especially users, may prefer to sweep potential incidents under the rug rather than
risk improperly responding and having to face a punitive-seeming AAR.
The AAR serves as a review tool, allowing the team to examine how it responded to the
incident. Examining the documentation of the incident should reveal the point at which the
incident was first detected, the point at which the IR plan was enacted, and how the first
responders and CSIRT reacted. This is to ensure that the best methods were employed and
that any mistakes made during the process, whether from a failure to follow the IR plan or
from errors in the IR plan, are not made again. The IR plan is continually reexamined during
AARs to ensure the procedures are in fact the best method of responding to incidents. Should
the AAR reveal that the incident represents a new type or variation of incident, additional
material can be added to the IR plan to better prepare the team for future interactions.
An additional use of the AAR is a historical record of events. Such a record may or may not
be a requirement for legal proceedings, depending on the laws that apply to your organiza-
tion. In any case, it is useful to be able to establish a timeline of events, drawn from a num-
ber of different sources, to show the evolution of the incident, from first identification to final
resolution. This timeline then serves other purposes, as described in the following sections.
One of the positive aspects of an incident is that it can improve an organization’s ability to
respond to future incidents; that is, “That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.”24 By
examining previous attacks, students of information security and IR can learn from others’
actions, whether correct or incorrect. You can learn as much from mistakes as from suc-
cesses. As Thomas Edison is credited with saying “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000
ways that won’t work.”25

Honest effort in the pursuit of one’s goals is not failure. By studying the AAR reports from
an organization’s past incidents, not only do the new information security professionals and
CSIRT members become familiar with the system, plans, and responses of the organization,
they get a lesson in how to deal with the challenges of incident response in general. Part of
knowing yourself is knowing how you and your team handle victories as well as defeats.
Even in defeat, however, as in the case of a successful and consequential attack, the organiza-
tion must continue, recover, and rebuild its defenses.
One final quote on the AAR and its reports, this one from Yogi Berra: “It ain’t over ’til it’s
over.” People require closure, especially in the wake of traumatic events. The AAR serves as
a closure to organizational incidents, although there may still be a great deal of systems data
and recovery and training to be done.
Ensure Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises
An untested plan is no plan at all. Very few plans are executable as written; they must be
tested to identify weaknesses, faults, and inefficient processes. Once problems are identified
during the testing process, improvements can be made, and the resulting plan can be relied
on in times of need. Five strategies that can be used to test contingency plans are:
●
Desk check—Each member of the CSIRT performs a desk check by reviewing the IR
plan and creating a list of correct and incorrect components. Although not a true test,
it is a good way to review the perceived feasibility and effectiveness of the plan.
●
Structured walk-through—All involved individuals walk through the steps they would
take during an actual event. This can consist of an on-site walk-through, in which the
team discusses its actions at each location and juncture, or it may be more of a “chalk
talk,” in which team members sit together and discuss in turn their responsibilities as
the incident unfolds.
●
Simulation—Each team member works separately, simulating the performance of each
task. The simulation stops short of the physical tasks—installing the backup or dis-
connecting a communications circuit. The major difference between a walk-through
and a simulation is that individuals work on their own tasks and are responsible for
identifying the faults in their own procedures.
●
Parallel testing—Team members act as if an incident occurred, performing their
required tasks and executing the necessary procedures without interfering with the
normal operations of the business. Great care must be taken to ensure that the proce-
dures performed do not halt the operations of the business functions, creating an
actual incident.
●
Full interruption—Team members follow each and every procedure—interrupting ser-
vice, restoring data from backups, and notifying appropriate individuals. This type of
testing is often performed after normal business hours in organizations that cannot
afford to disrupt business functions. Although full interruption testing is the most rig-
orous, it is unfortunately too risky for most businesses.
●
War gaming—Team members act as defenders, using their own equipment or a dupli-
cate environment, against realistic attacks executed by external information security
professionals. This valid, effective training technique is so popular that there are
national competitions at conferences like Black Hat (http://blackhat.com) and
DEFCON (www.defcon.org). War gaming competition at the collegiate level is held at

the West Point Military Training Academy (itcf.cs.ucsb.edu). A National Collegiate
CyberDefense Competition has been held annually since 2005, and details can be
found at www.nationalccdc.org.
While the authors emphatically denounce the actions of hackers and
the criminal acts associated with hacking, these conferences are typi-
cally attended not only by hackers but by information security profes-
sionals and representatives of law enforcement and the military. In
keeping with our philosophy of “know your enemy,” one cannot
pass up the opportunity to visit the enemy’s camp and observe them
preparing for battle, learning their strategies and tactics firsthand.
At a minimum, organizations should conduct periodic walk-throughs (or chalk talks) of each
of the CP component plans. A failure to update each of these plans as the business and its
information resources change can erode the team’s ability to respond to an incident, and pos-
sibly cause greater damage than the incident itself.
Training the Users Training the end user to assist in IR is primarily the responsibility
of those individuals who provide security education training and awareness (SETA) for the
organization. As part of the ongoing employee-training program, SETA trainers should
instruct end users on:
●
What is expected of them as members of the organization’s security team.
●
How to recognize an attack; each user should be instructed on what to look for and
be apprised of the key attack indicators.
●
How to report a suspected incident and who to report it to—that is, the help desk and
the information security hotline or e-mail address or some another designated
mechanism.
●
How to mitigate the damage of attacks on the desktop by disconnecting the system
from the network if they suspect an attack in progress, and by reporting suspected
incidents promptly.
●
Good information security practices that prevent attacks on the desktop, such as:

Keeping antivirus software up to date

Using spyware detection software

Working with systems administrators to keep the operating system and applica-
tions up to date with patches and updates

Not opening suspect e-mail attachments

Avoiding social engineering attacks by not providing critical information over the
phone or e-mail

Not downloading and installing unauthorized software or software from untrusted
sources

IR Plan Maintenance
The final phase of the IR planning function is plan maintenance. The specific processes for
maintaining the IR plan vary from one organization to another, but there are some com-
monly used maintenance techniques. When shortcomings are noted, the plan should be
reviewed and revised to remediate the deficiency. Deficiencies may come to light based on
AARs, when the plans are used for actual incidents, during rehearsals when the plan is used
in simulated incidents, or by review during periodic maintenance. At periodic intervals, such
as one year or less, an assigned member of management should undertake a review of the IR
plan that addresses the following questions:
●
Has the plan been used since the last review?
●
Were any AAR meetings held, and have the minutes of any such meetings been
reviewed to note deficiencies that may need attention?
●
Have any other notices of deficiency been submitted to the plan owner, and have they
been addressed?
Depending on the answer to these questions, the plan may need to be reviewed and amended
by the CPMT. All changes proposed to the IR plan must be coordinated with the CPMT so
that the plan remains aligned with the organization’s other contingency planning documents.
Chapter Summary
■
Contingency planning (CP) is the process of positioning an organization to prepare
for, detect, react to, and recover from events that threaten the security of information
resources and assets. The goal of CP is to restore normal operations after an unex-
pected event—in other words, to make sure things get back to the way they were
within a reasonable period of time.
■
CP has 12 stages:

Form the CPMT.

Develop the contingency planning policy statement.

Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA).

Form subordinate planning teams.

Develop subordinate planning policies.

Integrate the BIA.

Identify preventive controls.

Organize response teams.

Create contingency strategies.

Develop subordinate plans.

Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises.

■
The BIA provides the CP team with information about systems and the threats they
face.
■
The actions an organization should take while the incident is in progress are defined
in an incident response plan (IR plan).
■
Disaster recovery planning (DRP) entails the preparation for and recovery from a
disaster, whether natural or human-made.
■
Business continuity planning (BCP) ensures that critical business functions can con-
tinue if a disaster occurs.
■
Incident classification is the process of determining which events are possible inci-
dents. Three broad categories of incident indicators have been established: possible,
probable, and definite. The routine collection and analysis of data is required to
properly detect and declare incidents.
■
How and when to activate IR plans is determined by the IR strategy the organization
chooses to pursue. The organization must make sure the outcome from the planned
response meets the organization’s strategic and tactical needs. Two general strategies
govern how an organization responds to an incident: “protect and forget” or “appre-
hend and prosecute.”
■
One of the most critical components of IR is stopping the incident or containing its
scope or impact. Incident containment strategies vary depending on the incident and
on the amount of damage caused.
■
Once an incident has been contained and system control has been regained, incident
recovery can begin. The IR team must assess the full extent of the damage to deter-
mine what must be done to restore the systems.
■
The ongoing maintenance of the IR plan includes effective after-action reviews
(AARs), planned review and maintenance, training staff that will be involved in inci-
dent response, and rehearsing the process that maintains readiness for all aspects of
the incident plan.
■
There are a number of data backup and management methods that aid in the prepa-
ration for IR. The most commonly used varieties are disk backup and tape backup.
Backup methods must be based on an established policy that meets organizational
needs.

Hands-On Projects
Project 11-1
In this project, we examine ways for organizations to monitor their networks
for signs of possible attack. This project was created using the “Security
Onion” open-source project built for Intrusion Detection and Network
Security Monitoring. You can find out more about the project and its creator, Doug Burks,
at http://securityonion.blogspot.com.
To complete this project, it is recommended that you run Security Onion as a virtual
machine. Configure the VM to allow 1 GB of memory, 20 GB of disk space, and a single
NIC set to “bridged.” Configuring virtual machines is outside the scope of this project, but
there are numerous tutorials available on the Internet. You will also need to install the
Nmap/Zenmap GUI network scanning application or have it available elsewhere on the
network.
This project was written using VMWare and the 20111103 release of Security Onion.
1. Start the virtual machine. When prompted, choose the live – boot the Live System
option. After a brief delay, Security Onion will start.
2. On the desktop, double-click the Setup icon, as highlighted in Figure 11-13, to start the
setup process.
3. Click Yes, Continue!
4. Click Yes, use Quick Setup!
5. When prompted, enter a username for the Sguil setup, as shown in Figure 11-14. Note:
Remember this username, as it will be needed later in the exercise.

8. Click Yes, proceed with the changes!
9. After a brief delay, click OK to complete the setup process.
One of the many features built into Security Onion is SQueRT, a Web-based tool that
allows monitoring of IDS/NSM events in real time. SQueRT can be accessed either
within the VM by double-clicking the Squert icon on the desktop or by opening a Web
browser on another system and pointing it to http://IP address of the Security Onion
system/squert/squert.php—for example, http://192.168.1.114/squert/squert.php. Either
method is acceptable for the steps going forward.
10. At the SQueRT login screen, enter the username and password you supplied during the
initial setup, as shown in Figure 11-15, then click submit.
11. Depending on the level of network activity present, you may already see alerts already
present. Disregard these, as we will be generating our own using the Nmap application.
Note that at the top of the page there are several tabs to choose from. Click through all
of them quickly to become aware of what each has to offer, then return to the Sum-
mary. Take note of the data presented at the top of the page, including “total events.”

12. On the second system, start the Nmap/Zenmap GUI.
13. In the Target field, type the IP address of the Security Onion system and choose
the Intense scan option in the Profile list, then click Scan. After a brief delay, Nmap/
Zenmap should complete its scan and return a set of results, similar to what is shown
in Figure 11-16.
14. Go back to the SQueRT browser window and refresh the page. Note that the “total
events” count has increased and has new information in the “Event Distribution” and
“Top Signatures” sections. This is a lot of general information, but the details are
sketchy. Click Query at the top of the page in order to get further details on the ques-
tionable traffic.
15. Change the View option from signature to event detail, and click submit. SQueRT
will display details from the current day, which should look similar to what is shown
in Figure 11-17.
16. We now examine one of the entries in greater detail. Look through the entries until you
find one with the Signature value of “ET POLICY Suspicious inbound to MSSQL port
1433,” then click the date/time stamp for that entry. A window will pop up that shows
complete details on the traffic in question, as shown in Figure 11-18. Once these details
are displayed, security professionals can make a further determination as to whether or
not an incident is actually occurring and take appropriate steps based on that finding.

Introduction
The word forensics comes from the Latin word forensis, which in ancient Rome referred to
the forum—the precursor to today’s courts of law.1 When its information resources have
been affected by an incident and an organization decides to apprehend and prosecute the
offender(s), it must collect information in such a way that the information will be usable in a
criminal or civil proceeding. This information is usually called “evidence,” but in fact nothing
is evidence until a judge admits it as evidence in court. During legal proceedings, opposing
counsel can (and usually will) challenge this admission on every available ground. Even some-
thing as simple as just taking a look at a compromised computer may allow opposing counsel
to challenge the information gathered from that computer on the grounds that it might have
been modified or otherwise tainted.2
What we really mean by evidence, therefore, is items of potential evidentiary value.3
Computer forensics is, thus, defined as the use of technical investigation and analysis techni-
ques to identify, collect, preserve, and analyze electronic items of potential evidentiary value
so that they may be admitted as evidence in a court of law, used to support administrative
action, or simply used to further analyze suspicious data. This definition has been generally
interpreted to apply almost exclusively to computers and computer-based media. The term
digital forensics, which covers a broader area, applies to all modern electronic devices, includ-
ing mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable music players, and other elec-
tronic devices capable of storing digital information.
With all the due diligence completed, the EBS team was finally able to take a breath.
The PCI audit was next week, and most of the loose ends were tied up. Through
several months, the team had looked at its vulnerability management program, hard-
ening practices, security event monitoring, and incident response procedures. The
effort was finally paying off.
One of the last items to address was EBS’s digital forensics capability. In a typical
business day, forensics was not part of the information security program. It was only
in cases of compromised servers, zero-day vulnerability exploits, or unusual attacks
that EBS enlisted the services of a third party in order to properly analyze the
residual data on a system.
Despite the lack of in-house resources, this ability to perform digital forensics was
critical and was going to be of interest to the auditors. Paige planned a last-minute
trip to the third-party digital forensic consultancy that EBS used. The visit would help
her evaluate the processes the agency used as well as the evidence-handling
procedures.

In this chapter, you will learn the requirements for digital evidence, the processes involved in
identifying and acquiring it, and the general process of analyzing digital evidence.
Legal Matters
Although the process of conducting digital forensics within an organization does not
necessarily lead to prosecution, that is the most important outcome. Thus, it’s important
to understand various aspects of the U.S. legal system that have a bearing on the digital
forensics process, including how to interact with law enforcement personnel.
Search and Seizure
The laws governing private sector search and seizure are somewhat more straightforward
than the ones that govern public sector search and seizure. Certain conditions must be met
in order to ensure that any evidentiary material found is admissible in any legal proceedings
that follow, whether administrative or judicial. In the public sector, law enforcement agents
generally must have a search warrant or the employer’s consent to search for evidentiary
materials. In the private sector, an organization wishing to search an employee’s computer
must generally meet the following conditions:
●
The employee must have been made aware of the organizational policy establishing
that such a search may occur.
●
The search must be justified from its inception. There must be a legitimate business
reason for the search—that is, it will be conducted by an authorized individual to
locate legitimate evidence or to look for suspected misconduct involving organiza-
tional resources. If an organization routinely searches every employee’s computer or
if it conducts truly random searches and uncovers potential evidentiary material,
then the findings are admissible.
●
The search must be permissible in its scope—that is, it must have a specific focus and
be constrained to that focus. This requirement does not prohibit the use of materials
found during a normal, less focused business search, but it precludes a search of the
organization’s entire set of data if the identified area of interest has been confined to
one or two folders or directories.
●
The organization must have clear ownership of the container the material was
discovered in. This precludes searches of the employee’s person, personal belongings,
and personal technologies but does not exclude those containers provided by the
organization for the employee’s use, such as a PDA, cell phone, laptop, and so on.
Gray areas include employee-purchased briefcases, satchels, and backpacks used to
transport work as well as personally owned computers, PDAs, and cell phones used
by telecommuters.
●
The search must be authorized by the responsible manager or administrator. For
systems, the senior system administrator must authorize the search, unless of course
that person is a suspect in an internal investigation. For most organizational
equipment, a designated manager must provide authorization. Forward-thinking
organizations designate a senior executive officer (e.g., the chief information officer)
as a magistrate who authorizes organizational searches. Even then, the search should

be conducted by a designated, disinterested individual, such as the CISO or other
individual recommended by legal counsel.
Once these conditions are met, an organization should have a reasonable degree of confidence
in its right to search for and collect potentially evidentiary material. This does not mean that
any administrative or judicial actions will go unchallenged; however, it does mean that the
organization has much stronger grounds to refute any allegations of impropriety.
Interacting with Law Enforcement
When an incident violates civil or criminal law, it is the organization’s responsibility to notify
the proper authorities. Which is the appropriate law enforcement agency depends on the type
of crime committed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for example, handles
computer crimes that are categorized as felonies. The U.S. Secret Service investigates crimes
involving U.S. currency, counterfeiting, and certain cases involving credit card fraud and
identity theft. The U.S. Treasury Department has a bank fraud investigation unit, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission has investigation and fraud control units as well.
However, given these agencies’ heavy caseloads, they typically give priority to those incidents
that affect the country’s critical infrastructure or that have significant economic impact.
Gordon Snow, the assistant director of the FBI’s Cyber Division, is on record as saying:
Countering efforts by foreign countries to steal our nation’s secrets, evaluating
the capabilities of terrorists in a digital age, and fighting cyber crime are the
FBI’s highest priorities. It is difficult to overstate the potential impact these
threats pose to our economy, our national security, and the critical infrastructure
upon which our country relies …
Cyber criminal threats to the U.S. result in significant economic losses. But the
threat against financial institutions is only part of the problem. Also of serious
concern are threats to critical infrastructure, the theft of intellectual property,
and supply chain issues. U.S. critical infrastructure faces a growing cyber threat
due to advancements in the availability and sophistication of malicious software
tools and the fact that new technologies raise new security issues that cannot
always be addressed prior to adoption. The increasing automation of our critical
infrastructures provides more cyber access points for adversaries to exploit.4
In other words, if the crime doesn’t affect the U.S. national infrastructure or is not an attempt to
commit an interstate criminal act, the FBI may not be able to assist an organization as effectively
as state or local agencies could. However, in general, if a crime crosses state lines, it becomes a
federal matter. The FBI may also become involved at the request of a state agency.
Each state, county, and city in the United States has its own law enforcement agencies. These
agencies enforce all local and state laws, handle suspects, and secure crime scenes for state and
federal cases. Local law enforcement agencies rarely have computer-crime task forces, but the
investigative (detective) units are quite capable of processing crime scenes and handling most
common criminal violations, such as physical theft, trespassing, damage to property, and the
apprehension and processing of suspects in computer-related crimes.
Involving law enforcement agencies has advantages and disadvantages. Such agencies are
usually much better equipped for processing evidence than business organizations. Unless the
security forces in the organization have been trained in processing evidence and computer

forensics, they may do more harm than good when attempting to extract information that
can lead to the legal conviction of a suspected criminal. Law enforcement agencies are also
prepared to handle the warrants and subpoenas necessary when documenting a case. They
are adept at obtaining statements from witnesses, affidavits, and other required documents.
For all these reasons, law enforcement personnel can be a security administrator’s greatest
allies in prosecuting a computer crime.
It is, therefore, important to become familiar with the appropriate local and state agencies
before you have to make a call announcing a suspected crime. Most state and federal agen-
cies offer awareness programs, provide guest speakers at conferences, and offer programs
such as the FBI’s InfraGard program (www.infragard.net). These agents clearly understand
the challenges facing security administrators.
The disadvantages of involving law enforcement include possible loss of control of the chain
of events following an incident, including the collection of information and evidence and the
prosecution of suspects. An organization that wishes to simply reprimand or dismiss an
employee should not involve a law enforcement agency in the resolution of an incident.
Additionally, the organization may not hear about the case for weeks or even months
because of heavy caseloads or resource shortages.
A very real issue for commercial organizations when involving law enforcement agencies is
the tagging as evidence of equipment vital to the organization’s business. When this happens,
organizational assets can be removed, stored, and preserved to prepare the criminal case.
Despite these difficulties, if the organization detects a criminal act, it has the legal obligation
to notify the appropriate law enforcement officials. Failure to do so can subject the organiza-
tion and its officers to prosecution as accessories to the crime, or they can be charged with
impeding the course of an investigation. It is up to the security administrator to find out
when each law enforcement agency needs to be involved and which crimes it addresses.
Adversarial Legal System
Perhaps one of the most confusing things about the U.S. legal system is its adversarial nature.
Two parties enter the proceeding holding opposing views on a question of fact and attempt
to prove that their own views are correct either beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal
proceeding) or with a preponderance of the evidence (civil proceeding).
Within the rules of the court, everything is open to challenge by opposing counsel. Consider
a criminal case involving possession of child pornography. During her analysis, the prosecu-
tor’s forensic investigator found criminal images involving small children on the defendant’s
computer; the defense would likely challenge this finding on some of the following grounds:
●
Was the prosecution’s forensic expert properly trained and qualified?
●
Did the evidence collection process follow established procedures to ensure that the
evidence was not modified in any way during its collection and analysis?
●
Was the evidence under proper controls at all times, and is the chain of custody complete?
●
Were the images actually downloaded by the defendant, or were they downloaded by
a hacker, virus, or other malware?
These types of issues are what laypeople think of as technicalities—the kinds of things that a sly
attorney uses to get a guilty person off. However, the adversarial roles played by opposing

counsel ensure that all parties “follow the rules.” Thus, the wise forensic practitioner never
thinks in terms of “if this is challenged” but in terms of “when this is challenged.”
Digital Forensics Team
In their book, Principles and Practice of Criminalistics, Keith Inman and Norah Rudin argue
that forensics is really about translating a real-world problem into one or more questions that
can be answered by means of forensic analysis.5 Therefore, the digital forensics team is a team
of experts responsible for translating a real-world problem into one or more questions that can
be answered by means of digital forensic analysis. For example, let’s say Joe is suspected
of having violated his organization’s intellectual property policy by disclosing details of a new
product to a competitor in hopes of gaining employment with that competitor. The challenge
for the digital forensic analyst is to translate the question “Did Joe violate the IP policy by
disclosing the product details to a competitor?” into a series of questions answerable by digital
forensic investigation, such as:
●
Did Joe access the new product information during the relevant time period?
●
Are there indications of a quid pro quo agreement between Joe and the competitor?
●
Did Joe send e-mails to the competitor containing that information?
●
Did Joe transmit the information to the competitor over the network?
The answers to these questions might be found on the disk image of Joe’s computer, network
logs, access logs for a file server, data leakage protection (DLP) tools, or within other digital
sources.
To tackle the task of digital forensics, many organizations divide the roles into two teams:
1.
First response—This team will assess the location, identify sources of relevant digital
information, collect evidence, and preserve the evidence for later analysis.
2.
Analysis and presentation—This team will analyze the collected information to identify
material facts relevant to the investigation, prepare the results of the investigation, and
finally present the results of the analysis to management or support possible legal
action.
First Response Team
The size and makeup of a first-response team will vary based on the size of the organization
and other factors, but the team often includes the following roles and duties:
●
Incident manager—Surveys the scene and identifies sources of relevant information;
orchestrates the work of the other team members and usually produces any photo-
graphic documentation
●
Scribe or recorder—Produces the written record of the team’s activities and maintains
control of the field evidence log and locker
●
Imager—Collects copies or images of digital evidence
Consider a situation in which a digital forensics team has been given the assignment of per-
forming on-site data collection at an employee’s office. After securing the scene, the scribe

begins the written record of the events taking place. The incident manager enters the scene to
survey the situation, identify and photographically document the locations of evidence
(computer, servers, disk arrays, etc.), and prioritize the collected evidence. Some considera-
tions that guide this prioritization are:6
●
Value—The likelihood that the information will be useful
●
Volatility—The stability of the information over time. Some types of information are
lost when the power is cut, and others are lost by default over time (e.g., log records
overwritten with newer data).
●
Effort required—The amount of time needed to acquire a copy of the information
After the sources of information have been prioritized, the incident manager photographs
equipment that will be removed for imaging, identifies a safe area for the imager to set up
equipment, and directs him or her in removing items to image. The scribe also documents
the equipment removals within the written record.
As the imager finishes imaging an item, its integrity assurance (hash and other information) is
documented in the written record, the image is logged into the field evidence locker, and the
original item is returned for reinstallation.
When all the items have been imaged, the incident manager, as part of the exit process, com-
pares the scene’s appearance to the initial photographic survey to ensure that the team has
left little trace of its presence.
Analysis Team
Whether performed in-house or outsourced to a third party, the analysis and presentation
phase is performed by persons specially trained in the use of digital forensic tools to analyze
the collected information and provide answers to the question(s) that gave rise to the investi-
gation. These digital forensics tools help forensic analysts recover deleted files, reassemble file
fragments, and interpret operating system artifacts.
The forensic analysis phase is sometimes further broken into two parts: examination and
analysis. The examination phase involves the use of forensic tools to recover deleted files,
retrieve and characterize operating system artifacts, and obtain other relevant material,
whereas the analysis phase involves using those materials to answer the question(s) that gave
rise to the investigation.
Larger organizations may delineate these two functions as separate job descriptions: forensic
examiners, who are skilled in the operations of particular tools used to gather the information,
and forensic analysts, who know operating systems and networks as well as how to interpret
the information gleaned by the examiners. Additionally, an incident will sometimes require
expertise in subject areas beyond the purview of the forensic analysis team—for example, ana-
lyzing data from a Lotus Notes server that has been compromised. In these cases, the team
should draw upon a pool of resources that’s already been set up to help with forensic analysis.
The presentation portion of the analysis and presentation phase encompasses reporting and
presenting the investigation’s findings. Forensic reports serve a variety of audiences, ranging
from upper management to legal professionals and other forensic experts that may use the
findings to build a case in court; therefore, the reports must clearly communicate highly tech-
nical matters without sacrificing critical details.

Effective communication becomes even more critical when the forensic analyst is called into
court, where the audience includes a judge and jury (who likely have only a nodding
acquaintance with computer technology) and an opposing counsel whose job is to undermine
the analyst’s findings and expertise.
Presenting a forensic analysis to a nontechnical audience can be quite
challenging. If the analyst’s presentation is ineffective, the findings are
likely to be regarded as technical gobbledygook; worse, members of the
jury may perceive that the analyst is talking down to them.
Analogies play an important part in communication; a common analogy is using the
library card catalog to illustrate how deleted files are recovered. A computer hard drive
is rather like a large library in which books (files) are shelved according to the informa-
tion in a card catalog (file system directory). Deleting a file is rather like removing the
book’s card from the card catalog. The pointer to the book is gone, but the book itself
can still be found in the library stacks, although it might take some searching.
This analogy aptly illustrates how a technical process can be explained to a nontechni-
cal audience. Sometimes the most challenging part of presenting the results of forensic
analysis is finding a relevant analogy that helps the audience grasp the technical
details.
Dedicated Team or Outsource?
Should an organization have a dedicated digital forensics team? That depends on the size and
nature of the organization as well as the available resources. Sometimes, the need for a digital
forensic unit is obvious, as in the case of large enterprises that are subject to frequent net-
work attacks (government agencies or high-profile companies like Microsoft); but as digital
information becomes more and more critical for business operations, organizations of all
types and sizes may be required to engage in some form of digital forensic investigation. In
the case of smaller companies, they may need to consult a third party for this type of
expertise.
An organization should consider the following in deciding whether to employ in-house
investigatory expertise:7
●
Cost—This includes the tools, hardware, and other equipment used to collect and
examine digital information as well as staffing and training.
●
Response time—Although hiring an outside forensic consultant may seem
less expensive because you only pay when the service is actually used, the
interruption to normal business operations while the consultant gets up to speed
may turn out to be more expensive than maintaining an in-house forensic
capability.
●
Data sensitivity—Providing outside consultants with access to the organization’s
information resources may prove complicated. Forensic data collection can expose
highly sensitive information, such as personal health records, credit card information,
business plans, and other sensitive information.

Forensic Field Kit
Most digital forensic teams have a prepacked field kit, also known as a jump bag, which
has a set of all the portable equipment and tools needed for an investigation. This
preplanning ensures that the team can leave at a moment’s notice to perform the
necessary response and analysis. The key is that the equipment in the kit should never
be borrowed or used in order to keep the kit at the ready. The field kit is typically
as personal as the individual investigator, but the one shown in Figure 12-1 is a fairly
standard kit.
A kit can include:
●
Forensic laptops that have multiple operating systems and can be dedicated to the
field kit. These ensure that no prior evidence contaminates the investigation by using
the investigator’s laptops.
●
Call list with subject matter experts in various IT technologies, management, and
other stakeholders in the incident management process
●
Mobile phones with extra batteries and chargers for continuous communication
during the investigation
●
Hard drives, blank CDs, blank DVDs, and thumb drives to use for evidence collection
(must be sanitized and free from previous evidence!)
●
Imaging software or hardware with write blockers (more on these tools later in the
chapter)
●
Forensic software and tools to perform the forensic data collection and analysis
(more on these tools later in the chapter)
●
Ethernet tap to sniff network traffic. This can be a DIY project using a simple switch
or prepackaged products sold by Barracuda Networks or Net Optics.

Extension cords and power strips to power all the equipment in areas that have either
few or hard-to-reach outlets

Evidence bags, seals, and permanent markers for storing and labeling evidence. The
bags should be anti-static and might need desiccants—or drying agents—to absorb
any moisture.

and straps, mechanics’ mirrors, telescoping lights and grabbers, and other tools that
may come in handy for opening computer equipment.
Digital Forensics Methodology
Usually, a digital investigation begins with an allegation of wrongdoing—either a policy
violation or the commission of a crime (see Figure 12-2). Based on that allegation, authoriza-
tion is sought to begin the investigation by collecting relevant evidence. In the public sector,
this authorization may take the form of a search warrant; in the private sector, it takes the
form specified by the organization’s policy. Many private sector organizations require a
formal statement, called an affidavit, which furnishes much of the same information usually
found in a public sector search warrant. In the private sector, it is more common to authorize
collecting images of digital information; in the public sector, the warrant authorizes seizure of
the relevant items that contain the information.

Assessing the Scene
It is important to assess the scene and document its state before the forensics team moves in
to collect evidence. This process typically involves interviewing the key contacts (the incident
reporter, the relevant system owner, business unit manager, etc.) and documenting the scene
as is. To do so, forensics teams typically use two methods: photography and field notes.
Photography Photographic evidence plays a major role in documenting evidence and its
provenance. Like forensic analysis of computer systems, capturing the state of the scene can
help investigators go back for reference during the analysis phase. For example, photographs
can help answer questions like: Did the server have both network cables plugged in at the time
of the incident, or was it only connected to one network? The best tool for photography is the
digital camera, which offers much more convenience than a traditional field camera but does
require some preparation and sound practices. When using a digital camera, one should:
●
Sterilize the digital photographic media (memory card). Forensic sterilization can
easily be performed by formatting the card to destroy the directory information and
then using a tool such as SDelete from Sysinternals (www.sysinternals.com) to clear
the card of any existing content.
●
Set the camera’s clock to ensure that the dates/times recorded for the digital
photographs are accurate.
●
Make the photographic media “self-documenting” by taking the first exposure of a
“Begin Digital Photography” marker.
●
Ensure that the :DPM (Digital Photographic Media) number—a tracking number
assigned to the particular card—is identified in the digital photography log as each
photograph is taken.
●
At the conclusion of the on-site activities, make an “end of photography”
exposure.
●
Remove the card from the camera, package it in a static bag, and seal it in an
evidence envelope, like any other piece of digital evidence. (There is more on evidence
handling later in this chapter.)
●
Do not make hashes of digital photographs until the first time the evidence envelope is
opened.
Field Notes A valuable companion to the digital photographs is the collection of field
notes. Field notes are any notes that help investigators remember key aspects of a scene and
the evidence collected. These notes are normally assembled into a case file that travels with
the investigation team and becomes a permanent part of the documentary record of the
investigation.
A number of forms can help the team keep these notes, such as:
●
Scene Sketch form—The scene sketch is the only item that can be done in pencil.
Its purpose is to show the general locations of items. A sample is provided in
Figure 12-3.
●
Field Activity Log form—This documents the team’s activities during evidence
collection (see Figure 12-4).

Acquiring the Evidence
An organization’s incident response (IR) policy must spell out the procedures for initiating
the investigative process, including management approvals. This is particularly critical in the
private sector, as private organizations do not enjoy the broad immunity accorded to law
enforcement investigations. In general, a law enforcement organization cannot be sued for
its conduct during an investigation; a private organization can become the target of a retalia-
tory lawsuit for damages arising from an investigation that proves to be groundless.
Once the authorization to conduct an investigation is obtained, the collection of evidence can
begin. As shown earlier, this is also the point when IR begins to interface with the forensics
process.
At heart, digital evidence collection is a four-step process:
1.
Identifying sources of evidentiary material
2.
Authenticating the evidentiary material

3.
Collecting the evidentiary material
4.
Maintaining a documented chain of custody
Upon completion of the collection process, the evidence awaits presentation and reporting in
some formal proceedings.
Identifying Sources Identifying evidence sources is somewhat straightforward in the
physical world of bloodstains and fingerprints, but it is much more complex in the digital
world. In a suspect’s corporate office, simple data collection may involve hundreds of
gigabytes of information that resides on:
●
Disks in a desktop or laptop computer (or both)
●
Disks in external storage enclosures
●
Memory sticks or cards
●
PDA (possibly with additional removable memory cards installed)
●
Cellular phone (including any memory cards installed in it)
●
Storage devices such as MP3 players
●
Optical storage such as CDs and DVDs
●
Networked storage

When identifying evidence in a data center (perhaps as part of an intrusion or complex fraud
investigation), the sources of potential evidence also include:
●
Disks attached to servers
●
Storage attached to a storage network, such as a fiber channel or iSCSI SAN
●
Files on NAS (network-attached storage) devices
●
Logs on servers, routers, firewalls, or centralized logging servers
One of the more perplexing problems in collecting digital data concerns so-called volatile
information, such as the contents of a computer’s memory. Traditional forensic practice calls
for photographing a running computer’s screen and then disconnecting the power, but this
leads to loss of volatile information. Should investigators sacrifice the evidence stored on disk
by running tools to collect the volatile information, or should they sacrifice the volatile
information in favor of the information on disk? In time, better tools will make this less of a
quandary, but currently it is a challenge.
Authenticating Evidentiary Material Unlike objects in the physical world, which
have characteristics that set them apart from other objects, one binary digit looks pretty much
like any other. This presents a significant challenge in the practice of digital forensics, as the
legal system demands assurances that the information presented in court is authentic—for
example, it is a genuine image of the disk in John Doe’s workstation or a true copy of the log
records from the RADIUS server collected on January 15. You must be able to demonstrate
that the particular collection of bits being prepared is a true and accurate copy of the original.
One way to identify a particular digital item (which is represented as a collection of bits) is by
means of a cryptographic hash. This involves collecting a file or data into evidence and then
feeding that data through the hash function. (The hash tool is typically carried with the digital
forensics teams so as not to rely on any cryptographic libraries on a compromised system.) As
discussed in Chapter 3, hashes are mathematical functions that have the following properties
that make them ideal for this purpose:
●
Regardless of the size of their input, hash functions produce a fixed size output
(128 bits for MD5 and 160 bits for SHA-1).
●
It is computationally infeasible to determine a particular hash value based on a given input.
●
It is computationally infeasible to find another input that could produce the same
output value as a given input.
As the following example shows, simply changing the case of two letters generates very
different hash values:
:echo hello there > test.txt
:md5sum test.txt
782a482a8ba848cec578e3006678860c *test.txt
:echo Hello There > test.txt
:md5sum test.txt

When a piece of digital evidence is collected, its hash value is calculated and recorded. At any
subsequent point, the hash value can be recalculated to show that the item has not been
modified since its collection. This technique can also authenticate copies of the original item
as true and accurate copies. Two commonly used hashes are MD-5 and SHA-1. Command
line and GUI tools for calculating hashes are widely available, such as: md5sum, WinMD5-
Free, and MD5Deep.
In the recent past, there have been a number of research studies
aimed at validating the cryptographic strength of hash algorithms.8
In Australia, this research was successfully used to challenge digital
evidence,9 but the general consensus is that hashes are still
acceptable for demonstrating the integrity of digital evidence.10 NIST
is developing new hash algorithms that will be more resistant to the
types of attack outlined in recent research.
Collecting Evidence When collecting digital evidence, an investigator must decide on
the mode of acquisition: live or dead. Live acquisition is collecting evidence from a currently
running system, whereas dead acquisition involves powering down the system to copy the
data from the hard drives. The investigator must also decide how to package and image the
collected material. All the activities she undertakes must be accurately and thoroughly
documented. Most importantly, she must make no changes to the evidence.
The emphasis on making no changes to the evidence may seem overstated, but is justified by
the potentially serious consequences. Digital forensic findings can cost an organization
millions of dollars and deprive people of their jobs or (if used in criminal proceedings) their
freedom or even their lives.
When a piece of digital information is altered, the question arises: What exactly was changed?
Did an investigator inadvertently boot up a computer, or did the investigator plant evidence
and cover the modification by booting up the computer? Although it is possible to minutely
describe every change that occurred during the computer boot to verify that only those
changes were made in the image, such an effort is not likely to be rewarded, given the time
and expertise involved, the difficulty in explaining these changes to the judge and jury, and
the possibility of lingering doubts that will cause the evidence to be discounted.
To prevent doubts regarding the handling of evidence, labels and seals are crucial.
Although any secure package will serve, the use of packaging specifically designed for this
purpose aids proper documentation and storage. The evidence envelope is preprinted with
a form that collects the relevant information for establishing where, by whom, and when
the information was collected. The evidence seal is designed for single use and is very
difficult to remove without breaking it. Types of evidence labels and seals are shown in
Figures 12-7 and 12-8.
Challenges can also come from alleged contamination—that the evidence came from some-
where else or was somehow tainted in the collection process. For this reason, media that is
used to collect digital evidence must be forensically sterile, meaning that it contains no residue
from previous use. There are various ways to prepare sterile media, but a common method is
to write 0s to every block on the device to erase any previous contents and then, if needed,
format the device with a file system.

All sterilization procedures must be codified, and all media sterilization processes must be
documented. Most forensic practices maintain an inventory of sterilized media that should be
sealed and tagged to preclude the possibility of tampering (see Figure 12-9).
Live Acquisition When an investigator is faced with a running system that may have been
compromised, valuable information such as open network connections and other running
processes may reveal the intentions and mode of entry of the attacker. The investigator may

conclude that this volatile information is important enough to warrant conducting a live
acquisition, thus sacrificing the durable information that might be obtained by powering
down the system. Note that the investigator can later shut the computer down and image its
disk(s) to gather information that may be useful in identifying the mode of entry and other
activities of the attacker. However, because the live response tools modified that state of the
system, it is very unlikely that the information collected from the disks would be admissible
in any legal proceeding.
In a live acquisition, the investigator has no idea what the attacker did to the system during
the compromise. Common system tools may have been replaced with malicious versions, or
various traps may have been put in place to destroy information if the system is disturbed.
For these reasons, the investigator will typically use a trusted set of CD-based tools, such as
BackTrack, Helix, KNOPPIX STD, or F.I.R.E. These Live CDs, or CDs with full bootable
operating systems, contain a collection of tools and scripts that run a series of known-
to-be-good executables, and preserve their outputs.
There are also many stand-alone tools that help investigators gather evidence from live acquisi-
tion. Examples include Windows Forensic Toolchest (WFT), which you can learn more about
at www.foolmoon.net/security/wft/, SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT), which you can
learn more about at http://computer-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads, and First
Responder’s Evidence Disk (FRED), which you can learn more about at http://darkparticlelabs.
com/portfolio.php. These tools capture volatile information that might be useful in investigating
a system compromise.
WFT is essentially a driver script for running a series of tools that identifies and lists
running processes, active network connections, and other activity, then saves the output
on an external medium such as a thumb drive. It is designed for forensics use and
includes a number of integrity checks such as verifying the tools before they are run
(see Figure 12-10).

At the completion of WFT, the files logging its execution are hashed and their values displayed in
order to provide an integrity reference, as shown in Figure 12-11.
Although live acquisition is usually thought of in the context of a running server, the need to
acquire the state of an active process arises in at least two other situations:
●
Logs, the records for which are generated on a continuous basis, thus requiring a live
acquisition to capture their state at a point in time
●
Active devices such as PDAs and cellular phones
A continuously changing process presents challenges in acquisition, given that there is no
“fixed” state that can be collected, hashed, and so forth. This has given rise to the idea of

“snapshot forensics,”11 which involves capturing a point-in-time picture of a process, much
like a photograph that freezes the action of a running child.
Consider the log files on a centralized syslog server that is continually receiving log
records from firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication servers, application
servers, and other sources. Because log records are arriving on a more or less continual
basis, there is no “fixed” state of the log file that can be collected and hashed. For this
reason, a snapshot is taken of the active log file by copying it, perhaps using a normal
filecopy. This copy is then acquired (perhaps by another copy) and hashed to verify that
a true and accurate copy has indeed been acquired. The investigator should be prepared
to produce good documentation and to fully justify the actions in testimony, perhaps
using the analogy of extracting a single frame from a motion picture or of taking a still
photo of a running child, the idea being that the copy operation does not “add” informa-
tion to the item copied.
Often, an intrusion is detected by the end effect it has, such as the disk devices being deleted.
In these cases, the investigator must work backward to identify the evidence sources, but the
information in log records often provides critical evidence of how the situation developed
over time. For example, logs from the VPN and authentication servers might show an
intruder logging in from outside the corporate network, and records generated by manage-
ment applications might reveal the exact operations performed in deleting the disks from
the storage array.
Active devices such as PDAs and cellular phones present similar challenges.12 As long as they
have power, they are active (monitoring the status of tasks and appointments, checking for
e-mail or instant messages, managing connections with the cellular network), so their internal
state is continually changing. They also retain in memory a lot of volatile information that is
lost if the batteries are removed.
These types of small wireless devices are increasingly critical to modern forensic investiga-
tions because almost everyone has at least one and they are increasingly used for a variety
of business and personal communications, including e-mail and instant messaging. They
are also fairly promiscuous—if there is a compatible network available, it will connect to
it. A PDA seized from a suspect might be accessed wirelessly to modify or delete information,
and a cellular phone could continue to receive calls, instant messages, and e-mails after its
seizure.
For these reasons, it is critical to keep wireless devices from accessing (or being accessed
through) the network after seizure and during analysis. Because turning off the device’s
power would cause the volatile information to be lost, a better solution is to block wireless
access using a Faraday Cage. A Faraday Cage is an enclosure that ensures that electromag-
netic waves are blocked so that a device cannot transmit or receive radio waves while in
custody. For example, Paraben Corporation has developed the Wireless StrongHold Bag
shown in Figure 12-12 to protect wireless devices from wireless access while being transported
or stored.
This bag has a metallic coating that prevents the enclosed device from receiving or sending
wireless signals. To provide similar protection while an investigator works with the device,
Paraben designed the StrongHold Box, which is shown in Figure 12-13.

Equipping an organization to handle forensics with these types of devices can easily cost
$10,000–$20,000 in specialized hardware and software alone. For that reason and because
of the rapid change in the technology, forensic analysis using these devices is an excellent
candidate for outsourcing to a specialist consultant.
Dead Acquisition In a dead acquisition, the computer is typically powered off so that its
disk drives can be removed for imaging; the information on the devices is static (“dead”)
and durable. Although dead acquisition was developed for computer disks, it applies equally
well to disk-like devices such as thumb drives, memory cards, MP3 players, and others.
In dead acquisition, an investigator seeks to obtain a forensic image of the disk or device.
This image must include active files and directories as well as deleted files and file fragments.
Figure 12-14 shows a small snapshot of a portion of a file system.
A normal file system copy of the disk shown in Figure 12-14 would obtain File1 and File3,
which are the only active files. However, there is more information on the device, including:
●
The “Deleted” entry in the directory, which might contain useful information about
the deleted file
●
The remnant of File2 that was not overwritten by File3, which might contain useful
file fragments
●
File4, which has been deleted but not yet overwritten, so its contents should still be
recoverable
●
The free space, which might contain other files or fragments
To make sure this potentially valuable information is acquired, forensic investigators use bit-stream
(also known as sector-by-sector) copying when making a forensic image of a device. Bit-stream
copying reads a sector (or block, 512 bytes on most devices) from the source drive and writes it
to the target drive; this process continues until all sectors on the suspect drive have been copied.
Forensic imaging can be accomplished using specialized hardware tools or software running
on a laptop or other computer. The advantage of hardware tools specialized for the purpose of
copying disks is that they are generally faster. When performing a large imaging task (e.g.,
imaging disks from 150 desktop computers involved in a complex fraud investigation), a hard-
ware imaging solution will speed the process. A common type of hardware imaging solution is
the ImageMaSSter Solo, which is shown in Figure 12-15.

The disadvantages of hardware imaging platforms are cost and the fact that they support
only certain interfaces. For example, an IDE imaging device might require an expensive
upgrade to support SATA drives.
There are many software imaging and other forensic tools. Popular software tools include
EnCase Forensic, UNIX/Linux’s dd command, and Paraben’s Forensic Replicator. These
software packages run on a standard laptop or other system and support any disk interface
supported by the host. A laptop-based imaging solution is shown in Figure 12-16.

In the figure, the suspect drive on the left (enclosed, for imaging, in a protective rubber
“boot”) is connected to the laptop through a forensic bridge, which serves two purposes:
●
It bridges the IDE drive interface to the laptop USB interface.
●
It blocks any write requests the laptop might generate.
It is critical that the information on the suspect media not be changed during the imaging
process, because its value as evidentiary material may be compromised. Because Helix is
specialized for forensic use, it does not mount file systems or create swap partitions on any
of the attached disks; an experienced investigator following correct procedure should not
need any additional write block protection.
However, investigators are human, and most will admit to having at least once confused the
suspect and destination disks when performing imaging (say, at 4:00 AM, while imaging
the 72nd of 83 disks). For this reason, and to preclude any grounds for challenging the
image output, it is common practice to protect the suspect media using a write blocker.
Write blockers are devices that allow you to acquire the information on a drive without
accidentally damaging the drive’s contents. They do this by allowing read commands to pass
while blocking write commands—hence, their name.13 Write blockers are traditionally hard-
ware devices, but software write blockers are beginning to emerge. Hardware write blockers
have the advantage of having been vetted more often in legal cases. They’re also better under-
stood by the legal community, and they can perform the bridging function described earlier.
For example, a write blocker kit (such as the UltraKit sold by Digital Intelligence) may con-
tain bridges for IDE, SCSI, and SATA devices that both provide the write blocking function
to protect the suspect media and “bridge” the connection to a USB or FireWire compatible
with the laptop.
The Imaging Process Before imaging a piece of disk media, its origin and a description of
it (vendor, model and serial number) are documented in both written and photographic form.
This establishes the provenance of the disk image and helps to ensure its authenticity. Also,
the media used as the target for forensic imaging should be forensically sterile, and that
should be documented as well.
Once the suspect media is attached to the imaging setup, the general imaging process is as
follows:
1.
Calculate and record a baseline cryptographic hash of the suspect media.
2.
Perform a bit-stream image of the suspect media.
3.
Calculate and record a hash of the target (and, optionally, another hash of the suspect
media to verify it was not modified by the imaging process).
4.
Compare the hashes to verify that they match.
5.
Package the target media for transport.
The screenshot shown in Figure 12-17 shows the imaging process using the UNIX/Linux dd com-
mand being carried out with the following simple naming convention for the files produced:
●
The PI prefix indicates a pre-image hash.
●
The DI prefix indicates the disk image.
●
The AI prefix indicates a post-image hash.

Case numbers are of the form YYYY-BK-PAGE, in which the case numbers are assigned
from a standard record book of numbered pages. In the example, the case number
assigned is for the year 2008, book 1, page 0011. The four-digit item number provides a
reference number for this particular item of evidence and can be cross-referenced in the
Field Evidence Log.
As you can see in Figure 12-17, the hash for the image file matches the hash for the device; thus,
you can be confident that you have obtained a true and accurate image of the device. Once the
imaging is completed, the target media must be securely packaged. It can then be sealed in an
anti-static bag, sealed in an evidence envelope, and signed as shown in Figure 12-18.

Note the practice of signing across the seals to assure that someone else doesn’t break the
seal and replace it.
Maintaining a Chain of Custody Documentation of processes and procedures,
digital fingerprints, and secure packaging help demonstrate the authenticity of digital
evidence, but there are additional requirements in order to demonstrate that the evidence
has been protected from accidental or purposeful modification at every point from its col-
lection through analysis to presentation in court. What is protected is called the chain of
custody.
In principle, the chain of custody is quite simple; basically, it is a legal record of where the
evidence was at each point in its lifetime as well as documentation of each and every access
there was to it. An example of a chain of custody log is shown in Figure 12-19.
The usual process is that the field investigator maintains personal custody and control of the
sealed item until it is logged into the chain of custody log at the evidence storage room. Each
time the item is removed (for analysis, copying, etc.), it is logged out, forming a documented
trail of who accessed the information and when that access occurred.
Collected evidence must be stored and handled appropriately to protect its value, especially
because, in some cases, items may be stored for weeks or months before they are analyzed.
In fact, if the investigation results in legal proceedings, the evidence may be stored for years
before the matter is heard in court.

Proper storage requires a protected, controlled-access environment coupled with sound
processes governing access to its contents (e.g., limiting access to specifically authorized
personnel and documenting each access in the chain of custody log). The storage facility must
also maintain the proper environment for holding digital information, which means:
●
Controlled temperature and humidity
●
Freedom from strong electrical and magnetic fields that might damage the items
●
Protection from fire and other physical hazards
The evidence storage facility can be a specialized evidence room, a locked filing cabinet in an
office, or something in between.
Analyzing Evidence
To settle an issue that originated in the physical world and triggered a digital investigation, an
analyst must translate that issue into a series of questions that are answerable through forensic
analysis. These “digital world” questions will set the analysis’ scope and guide its progress.
The first step in the analysis process is to obtain the evidence from the storage area (signing it
out in the chain of custody log) and performing a physical authentication. This involves veri-
fying the written documentation (i.e., the manufacturer, serial number, and other identifying
information) against the actual item of evidence. After successful completion of that step, a
copy of the evidence is made for analysis, while the original returned to storage. (It is crucial
that the analysis never take place on the original evidence.) The copy of the evidence can then
be authenticated by recomputing its hash and comparing it to the written record.
Disk images must be loaded into the particular forensic tool used by the organization. This
typically involves processing the image into the format used by the tool, performing preproces-
sing such as undeleting files, carving data (recovering files, images, and so forth from
fragments in free space), and comparing to the hashes created by the digital forensics team at
the time of disk imaging.
Two of the major tools used in digital forensic analysis are EnCase Forensic, from Guidance
Software, and Forensic Toolkit (FTK), from AccessData. Although very similar in function,
they take different approaches to the analysis task.
FTK does extensive preprocessing of the evidence items, as shown in Figure 12-20, and it
organizes the various items into a tabbed display. It is common for an analyst to start this
preprocessing late in the day and leave it running overnight, so that it will be completed at
the beginning of the following workday.
EnCase Forensic takes a slightly different approach in that it presents an extensible forensic
platform that makes it easy for trained investigators to carry out their tasks. For example,
rather than finding all the deleted files and folders during lengthy preprocessing, EnCase
provides a right-click menu function to conduct analysis on specific files.
EnCase also supports EnScripts, which are written in a C-like language and automate tasks
not provided by the main program. There is a very active user community that develops and
contributes these scripts, and some of the functionality has been incorporated into recent
versions of EnCase. One type of EnScript is the “filter” that searches for particular types of
information. Running the Deleted Files filter produces the list of deleted files.

Searching for Evidence
With the increasing sizes of disk devices, identifying relevant information is one of the more
important analysis tasks. For example, when investigating a computer image in a case
involving widespread identity theft, credit and Social Security numbers are highly relevant.
As part of its preprocessing, FTK constructs an index of terms found in the image; the results
are available under the Search tab. Figure 12-21 shows the occurrences of the word “arson”
and the context of one of the search hits.

FTK also includes the Live Search tab, which allows searching on user-specified terms. Devel-
oping relevant search terms can be challenging. A technique from the legal profession called
“cartwheeling,” in which a term is extended via links to subsidiary terms, can help.14 For
example, the cartwheel diagram shown in Figure 12-22 shows how you can develop search
terms when investigating the unauthorized use of a keylogger.
EnCase also offers a flexible search interface and includes predefined filters for common
items such as e-mail and Web addresses as well as Social Security numbers. As relevant
items are located, they are “bookmarked” for inclusion in the final report.
Reporting the Findings
Once the analysis is complete, the findings must be reported in a written presentation and
(often) legal testimony. This report must clearly communicate the findings to the various
audiences that will use the report, such as the following:
●
Upper management, which is typically interested in the recommendations as to
whether or not the allegations were correct, the scope of a data breach, and the
impact and cost of that breach
●
A forensic expert retained by the opposition, who is interested in the details of evi-
dence collection and analysis so he can judge whether the analysis was done properly
and identify weaknesses that could be used to challenge it in court
●
Attorneys, judges, and juries, who are interested in compliance with the legal require-
ments and the real meaning of the evidence in deciding a question of fact
●
Other professionals (e.g., auditors and human resources departments), who are
interested in compliance with organizational policies and in identifying possible
changes to those policies
It is tempting to prepare a series of reports, each tailored to a particular audience. However,
if the investigation leads to legal proceedings, all these various reports are discoverable

(i.e., must be disclosed) by the opposing side. Any differences among the various versions
could cast doubt on the conclusions.
The safest approach is to prepare a single report, with an index to point the parties to their
particular areas of interest. The report should identify what gave rise to the investigation,
the sources of the evidence that was analyzed, the tools and processes that were used to
analyze the evidence, the specific findings, and an interpretation of the findings (i.e., whether
the evidence supports or disproves the allegation).
In general terms, the report summarizes the detailed records contained in the case file, the
analyst’s notebooks, and other documentation, which can be produced to address detailed
questions.
Encryption Concerns
Forensic tools excel at retrieving information that has been deleted through normal means or
hidden by the operating system. However, doing so can pose a significant threat to privacy
and to the confidentiality of an organization’s information assets.
Actions in the digital world leave many traces (such as records of Web sites visited or archived
e-mail messages), and these can be easily retrieved from discarded or recycled computer
equipment, causing data to leak outside the organization. This process is called data leakage,
as discussed in Chapter 9. Simson Garfinkel did an empirical study in which he purchased
used computers and drives from online merchants and analyzed what was left on the devices
by their previous owners (either inadvertently or due to poor deletion processes).15 He found
medical and business records and many other types of confidential information.
NIST has documented recommended practices for removing data from storage media in Special
Publication 800-88, Guideline for Media Sanitization. These practices range from overwriting
disk media with 0s or random data to physical destruction.
Organizations must be aware that forensic tools are not just in the hands of honest profes-
sionals, they are available to everyone. Therefore, policies and procedures must be in place to
assure that discarded digital information is destroyed beyond the reach of forensic recovery.
An increasing concern for privacy and availability of encryption products has led to the
widespread use of encryption for individual files or entire devices. Although some encryption
is poorly done and is easily broken, quality products are increasingly available that use good
encryption algorithms beyond our current capability to use brute force in cracking the data.
Encrypted information can present challenges to forensic investigators. A fairly common
encryption product accepts the encryption key when the user logs on and decrypts informa-
tion on the fly. When the system goes into screen saver mode or is powered down, the encryp-
tion key is destroyed and must be reentered. Unfortunately, data collected by a forensic inves-
tigator is encrypted and will not be readable without the key.
Some forensic products offer brute-force attacks against the encrypted information by using
dictionaries of common pass phrases. They are sometimes successful but can be defeated by a
good pass phrase. Also, encrypted information may exist in unencrypted form in temporary
“work files” or the paging file.

Chapter Summary
■
Computer forensics is the use of computer investigation and analysis techniques to
indentify, collect, preserve, and analyze electronic items of potential evidentiary value so
that they may be admitted as evidence in a court of law or used to support administrative
action. The term digital forensics refers to all modern electronic devices, including mobile
phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and portable music players.
■
A digital investigation begins with an allegation of wrongdoing—either a policy
violation or the commission of a crime. Based on that allegation, authorization is
sought to begin the investigation by collecting relevant evidence; once authorization
has been obtained, the collection of evidence can begin.
■
The first response digital forensics team secures and collects the devices, media, or
media images that are potentially evidentiary. Later, analysis and reporting techniques
are performed by persons specially trained in the use of forensic tools to analyze the
collected information and provide answers to the question(s) that gave rise to the
investigation.
■
To settle the issue that prompted an investigation, the analyst must translate that issue
into a series of specific questions that are answerable through forensic analysis, then
use the proper tools to answer those specific questions.
■
When an incident violates civil or criminal law, it is the organization’s responsibility
to notify the proper authorities and work with them throughout the investigation and
resolution of the matter.
■
Forensic tools can be used by investigators even to obtain information that has
been deleted from digital media. These tools can also be used for nefarious purposes—
that is, to illegitimately obtain private or proprietary information from discarded
digital media.

Hands-On Projects
Project 12-1
In this exercise, you learn more about various logs created by Linux systems as well
as how to view their contents. We use the logs of the “Security Onion” virtual
system created in Chapter 11.
1.
Start the Security Onion virtual machine.
2.
After logging in using the credentials created in Chapter 11, double-click the Terminal
icon on the desktop to start a terminal session.
3.
At the command prompt, type cd /var/log and press Enter.
4.
To display the directory contents, type ls and press Enter. Note there are several logs
present, but we will focus on the dmesg, messages, and lastlog files. The dmesg file con-
tains kernel messages generated at system boot. This can include messages regarding
hardware found and configured (or not) during boot, and it can also include messages
from the kernel during system operation. The contents of this file can be read two
different ways, as explained below.
5.
At the command prompt, type dmesg | more and press Enter. This will display file
output one page at a time. To advance a single line at a time, press Enter.
Alternatively, we can advance forward a screen by pressing the spacebar.
6.
If for some reason the dmesg command is not available, we can use the tail command
to view file contents located at the bottom of the file, which are the most recent entries
made. Type tail dmesg and press Enter. By default, the tail command returns
the last 10 lines present. To change this to a different number, use the –n <number>
option—for example, tail –n 20 dmesg. In general, dmesg file output should look
similar to what is shown in Figure 12-23.

The messages file functions as a “catchall” log file, collecting messages from various applica-
tions and system log daemons. This is an important file to examine when trying to do any
type of forensic analysis, as it can provide a great deal of data. We will examine this file’s
contents using the tail command in combination with the grep and more commands.
The grep command provides a way to search a file or files for a text string. When
combined with the pipe command (|), the grep command allows you to efficiently sift
through many lines of text to display only what you are looking for.
7.
Type tail messages | grep "Jan 11" and press Enter. This will display all lines in
the file that contain “Jan 11” anywhere in the text. If you find the output scrolls off the
top of the screen, remember you can use the more command to control the display—for
example, tail messages | grep "Jan 11" | more. Your output should look similar
to what is shown in Figure 12-24.
The lastlog file contains login times for all users. You would examine this file to help
determine if any unusual or unauthorized logins have taken place on the system. Unlike
the logs we discussed previously, you cannot use the tail command to view the
contents, given that this is a binary file.
8.
To view the log file contents, type lastlog |more and press Enter. Note this command
is available only to users with root privileges. Your output should look similar to what
is shown in Figure 12-25.

signals to travel on the same fiber-optic channel.
well-known ports Port numbers that are defined for most
common services—the Web (port 80), SSH (port 22), Simple
Mail Transport Protocol (port 25), POP Mail (port 110), and
many others.
white noise Unwanted noise from a signal coming across the
media at multiple frequencies; also referred to as “static noise.”
wide area network (WAN) A very large network that covers a
vast geographic region like a state, a country, or even the planet.
wireless access point A device that allows systems with
wireless network cards to attach to a wired network.
wireless IDPS An IDPS that monitors and analyzes
wireless network traffic, looking for potential problems
with the wireless protocols (Layers 2 and 3 of the OSI
model).
wireless local area network (WLAN) A group of intercon-
nected networking nodes operating within a limited
geographic area that offers network access by the use
of broadcast rather than physical media.
WLAN See “wireless local area network.”
work factor The amount of effort required to decode an
encrypted message when the key and/or algorithm is
unknown.
World Wide Web (WWW) A set of documents on the Internet
linked via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
worms Malicious programs that replicate themselves without
requiring another program to provide a safe environment for
replication.
write blockers Devices that allow an investigator to acquire
the information on a drive without accidentally damaging the
drive’s contents.
XML See “Extensible Markup Language.”
XOR See “exclusive OR operation.”
XSS See “cross-site scripting.”
