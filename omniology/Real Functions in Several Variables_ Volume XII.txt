Real Functions in Several Variables:  
Volume XII
1801 
Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Real Functions in Several Variables:

Introduction to volume XI
Introduction to volume XI,
Vector Fields III; Potentials, Harmonic Functions and Green’s
Identities
This is the twelfth volume in the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables.
It is the third volume on Vector Fields. It was necessary to split the material into three volumes
because the material is so big. In the ﬁrst volume we dealt with the tangential line integral, which
e.g. can be used to describe the work of a particle when it is forced along a given curve by some
force. It was natural to introduce the gradient ﬁelds, where the tangential line integral only depends
on the initial and the terminal points of the curve and not of the curve itself. Such gradients ﬁelds
are describing conservative forces in Physics.
Tangential line integrals are one-dimensional in nature. In case of two dimensions we consider the
ﬂux of a ﬂow through a surface. When the surface ∂Ωis surrounding a three dimensional body Ω,
this leads to Gauß’s theorem, by which we can express the ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld V through ∂Ω, which
is a surface integral, by a space integral over Ωof the divergence of the vector ﬁeld V. This theorem
works both ways. Sometimes, and most frequently, the surface integral is expressed as space integral,
other times we express a space integral as a ﬂux, i.e. a surface integral. Applications are obvious in
Electro-Magnetic Field Theory, though other applications can also be found.
In this book we introduce the scalar potential H of a gradient ﬁeld V, i.e. if we know that V is a
gradient ﬁeld, then it can be written V = −▽H, where the minus sign has conventionally been
added. Similarly, if instead V is a rotational ﬁeld, then there exists a vectorial potential W, such
that V = ▽× W = rotW. Given that V is a gradient ﬁeld, we set up a solution formula for the
corresponding scalar potential.
Similarly, if we know that V is a rotational ﬁeld, so its vectorial
potential W exists, we set up a solution formula for W. By using these ideas it is possible under mild
assumptions, from the knowledge of p = div V and P = rotV to reconstruct the vector ﬁeld V.
We proceed by giving some applications in Physics and Electomagnetism, before we turn to Poisson’s
equation and Laplace’s equation. The solutions of the latter equation are called harmonic functions,
which in their two-dimensional version also occurs in Complex Functions Theory, because it is not
hard to prove that the real part as well as the imaginary part of an analytic function are harmonic
functions in 2 dimensions. Finally, we show Green’s three identities.

Deﬁnitions
It was previously shown that a gradient ﬁeld is rotational free, i.e. ▽× ▽f = 0, and also that a
rotational ﬁeld is divergence free, i.e. ▽· (▽× V) = 0. It is then quite natural to ask the following
questions,
1) Is a rotational free vector ﬁeld also a gradient ﬁeld?
2) Is a divergence free vector ﬁeld also a rotational ﬁeld?
The answer is ‘yes’, if we add an extra assumption on the domain of V, namely that it is star
shaped. We have previously dealt with the ﬁrst question, so we recall that if V is rotational free,
rotV = ▽× V = 0 in a star shaped domain, then there exists a primitive F, such that V = ▽F.
In the applications in Physics one by convention introduces a minus sign, so F = −H, and we get
V = −▽H,
and the scalar ﬁeld H is then called a scalar potential of V. We note that if H and G both are scalar
potentials of the same vector ﬁeld V, then there exists a constant c ∈R, such that
G(x) = H(x) + c.
In other words, every scalar potential of V has the form H + c, c ∈R, if H is a scalar potential.
There are several ways of calculating the (candidate of a) scalar potential. We list some of them in one
of the following sections. We shall here for theoretical reasons focus on the following reconstruction
formula, where we assume that we can use 0 as a star point in the star shaped domain Ωof V, i.e. if
x ∈Ω, then also τx ∈Ωfor all x ∈[0, 1], so all points of the line segment
[0; x] := {τx | 0 ≤τ ≤1} ⊆Ω
for all x ∈Ω.
Then a (candidate of a) scalar potential is given by
H0(x) := −x ·

=

for x ∈Ω.
Before we prove this formula under the given assumption we shall give some warnings concerning the
practiacl applications of this formula:
Even if Ωis star shaped with 0 as a star point, this formula does not automatically make the result H0
a scalar potential. If rotV = 0, we know already that the scalar potential does not exist, because V
is not a gradient ﬁeld. And yet the formula can be applied! It only gives a wrong answer! Therefore,
whenever one uses a solution formula like the above one should always afterwards check, if we indeed
have V = −▽H0.
Another warning is the following. Although the solution formula apparently is straightforward to
apply, it usually gives some very nasty calculations. One should instead try other methods, which are
also applicable. It is mentioned here for theoretical reasons, because it gives a hint of how we should
solve the other problem mentioned above.

from which we conclude that ▽F = V. Since H = −F, the claim follows.
We leave the scalar potential and turn to the vectorial potentials. We assume that V is a divergence
free vector ﬁeld, ▽· V = div V = 0, in the star shaped domain Ω. Then the formula above for the
scalar potential of a rotational free vector ﬁeld gives us a hint that we may look for a formula of the

for x ∈Ω, provided that ▽· V = 0. We shall prove that this formula indeed is correct.
To shorten the notation we put
W0(x) = −x × S(x),
where S(x) :=

where we again write
U(x, τ) := V(τx),
and note that U(x, 1) = V(x).
Using the rules of calculation of nabla, listed in Section 36.2, we get
▽× W0

▽× (S × x) = (▽· x)S + (x · ▽)S −(▽· S)x −(S · ▽)x
=
3S + (x · ▽)S −(▽· S)x −S = 2S + (x · ▽)S −(▽· S)x.
As above we get by the chain rule for Ui, where U = (U1, U2, U3),

and we have proved that S is also divergence free, ▽· S = 0, so the result above is reduced to
▽× W0 = 2S + (x · ▽)S.
Finally, we calculate the i-th coordinate of the diﬀerential (x · ▽)S,

Then the i-th coordinate of ▽× W0 becomes
(▽× W0)i (x) = 2Si(x) + (x · ▽)S(x) = 2Si(x) + Vi(x) −2Si(x) = Vi(x),
so we conclude that under the assumptions above we indeed have ▽× W0 = V.

V = ▽× W0 = rotW0.
We call W0, derived in this way, a vectorial potential of the divergence free vector ﬁeld V.
Clearly, if a vector potential W0 of V exists in Ω, and ▽g is any gradient ﬁeld in Ω, then since
▽× ▽g = 0 we also get that W0 + ▽g is a vector potential of V. In fact, a check shows by the
linearity of rot that
▽× (W0 + ▽g) = ▽× W0 + ▽× ▽g = V + 0 = V.
Conversely, if both W0 and W1 are vector potentials of the same vector ﬁeld V, i.e.
V = ▽× W0 = ▽× W1,
then we get by subtraction that
▽× (W0 −W1) = 0,
which shows that the vector ﬁeld W0 −W1 is rotational free. Since we have assumed that the domain
Ωis star shaped, it follows from the ﬁrst part that there exists a scalar potential g, such that
W0 −W1 = −▽g,
i.e. by a rearrangement
W1 = W0 + ▽g.
We collect the results above in the following

Theorem 38.1 Theorem of potentials. Assume that Ω⊆R3 is a star shaped domain of a C1 vector
ﬁeld V : Ω→R3.
1) If ▽× V = rotV = 0 in all of Ω, then V is a gradient ﬁeld, i.e. there exists a scalar potential
H : Ω→R, such that
V = −▽H
in Ω.
If H is a scalar potential of V, then every scalar potential of V has the form H + c for some
constant c.
2) If ▽· V = div V = 0 in all of Ω, then V is a rotational ﬁeld, i.e. V can be written as a rotation
of a vectorial potential W, i.f.
V = ▽× W = rotW.
If W is a vectorial potential for V, then to any other vectorial potential W1 of V there exists a
function g, such that W1 = W + ▽g.
We note the following application: Assume that W is a vectorial potential of V, i.e. V = ▽×W, and
V is divergence free. Let F be a C1 (bounded) surface of closed piecewise C1 booundary δF. Then
it follows from Stokes’s theorem that

and we have proved
Theorem 38.2 The ﬂux of a divergence free vector ﬁeld V, which has the vectorial potential W, is
equal to the circulation of W along the boundary curve, i.e. if V = ▽× W, then

it should be noted that unlike the reconstruction formula for the scalar potential, where the path of
integration can be modiﬁed, we are here forced to use integration along the line segment
[0; x] := {τx | 0 ≤τ ≤1} ⊆Ω
for x ∈Ω.
If we change this path of integration without changing the integrand appropriately, we shall obtain a
wrong result. However, in order not to make things too diﬃcult in the computations when using this
formula, we recommend that one ﬁrst calculates the integral
U(x) :=

and then the vector product,

A vector ﬁeld given by its rotation and divergence
We shall in this section consider the following problem:
Given the divergence dV = ▽· V = p and the rotation rotV = ▽× V = P of an unknown
vector ﬁeld V. What conditions should be put on the given scalar ﬁeld p and vector ﬁeld P in
order to ﬁnd a formula for the vector ﬁeld V itself?
We shall give some suﬃcient conditions, namely that p and P are of class C1, and that they both
vanish outside a bounded domain Ω⊂R3. These assumptions will in general be suﬃcient for the
applications, because in Physics we may in most cases assume that the model is dealing with smooth
functions, and also that the processes are bounded in space.
As usual we shall not give a strict proof; only sketch it quoting a result, which cannot be proved here.
Due to the linearity the problem can be split into two simpler problems which then are solved sepa-
rately. We shall ﬁrst ﬁnd V1, when
div V1 = ▽· V1 = p,
and
rotV1 = ▽× V1 = 0.
Here p is a scalar ﬁeld, which is assumed to be 0 outside a bounded domain Ω. In mathematical terms,
p is assumed to have compact support contained in the compact set Ω⊂R3. (In Euclidean spaces a
compact set is a bounded closed set.)

Since V1 is supposed to be rotational free in R3, it is a gradient ﬁeld, so there exists a scalar potential
H, such that
V1 = −▽H.
Then by assumption,
div V1 = ▽· V1 = −▽· ▽H = −▽2 H = p,
so the scalar potential H must satisfy the so-called Poisson equation
▽2H = −p,
i.e.
∂2H
∂x2 + ∂2H
∂y2 + ∂2H
∂z2 = −p (x, y, z) .
Since p is zero outside the bounded set Ω, one can prove the following solution formula for Poisson’s
equation
H(x, y, z) = 1
4π

Ω
p(ξ, η, ζ)

(x −ξ)2 + (y −η)2 + (z −ζ)2 dξ dη dζ.
Clearly, this space integral is improper, when (x, y, z) ∈Ω.
However, it is easy to see that it is
convergent. Let (x, y, z) ∈Ωbe ﬁxed. By a translation of the coordinate system we may assume
that (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0), in which case the denominator in spherical coordinates becomes the radius r,
while the weight function r2 sin θ easily cancels the factor r in the denominator, when r →0. This
can be done for every point of Ω, and since Ωis bounded and p is continuous, the improper integral
is convergent. We shall not go further into the proof of that this really is the right solution.
Next we consider the similar problem, where instead
div V2 = ▽· V2 = 0
and
rotV2 = ▽× V2 = P,
where P is a given divergence free (otherwise ▽× V2 = P would not make sense) vector ﬁeld, which
is 0 outside the bounded set Ω, so P has also compact support, contained in Ω.
Then P has a vector potential W, i.f. V2 = ▽× W. We assume that div W = ▽· W = 0, which
actually also will follow from the solution formula below.
Using the assumption above it follows that
P = ▽× V = ▽× (▽× W) = ▽(▽· W) −▽2W = −▽2 W,
so W satisﬁes the vectorial Poisson equation
▽2W = −P,
which is equivalent to



▽2Wx = −Px,
▽2Wy = −Py,
▽2Wz = −Pz.
Each of these equations is a scalar Poisson equation, and since Px, Py and Pz are all zero outside the
bounded set Ω, we can use the same solution formula as above, so we get
W(x, y, z) = 1
4π

Ω
P(ξ, η, ζ)

(x −ξ)2 + (y −η)2 + (z −ζ)2 dξ dη dζ.
This particular W is therefore deﬁned as a convergent improper space integral, and it is not hard to
check that ▽· W = 0 as required.

Potentials
In the general case, where
div V = ▽· V = p
and
rotV = ▽× V = P,
and where we assume that p and P vanish outside the bounded set Ω, we split V in the following way
V = V1 + V2,
where
div V1 = ▽· V1 = p
and
rotV1 = ▽× V1 = 0,
and
div V2 = ▽· V2 = 0
and
rotV2 = ▽× V2 = P.
Using the solution formulæ above we can ﬁnd V1 and V2, hence also V = V1+V2. We have therefore
justiﬁed the following
Theorem 38.3 Helmholtz’z theorem. Let p and P be a scalar and a vector ﬁeld, resp., of class C1,
which are vanishing outside a bounded set Ω. We deﬁne
H(x, y, z) = 1

Ω

(x −ξ)2 + (y −η)2 + (z −ζ)2 dξ dη dζ,

4π

Ω
P(ξ, η, ζ)

(x −ξ)2 + (y −η)2 + (z −ζ)2 dξ dη dζ.
Then the vector ﬁeld
V := −▽H + ▽× W = −gradH + rotW
satisﬁes the diﬀerential equations
div V = ▽· V = p
and
rotV = ▽× V = P,
and the growth condition at inﬁnity,
V(x) =→0
for x →+∞.
This theorem is also called the fundamental theorem of vector analysis.
It should be noted that it in the omitted proof of this theorem is essential that we have V(x) →0 for
x →∞.
A consequence of the theorem above is that given the four equations (i.e. coordinate wise for rot)
div V = p
and
rotW = P,
where p and P vanish outside a bounded domain Ω, then we can ﬁnd all coordinate functions V1,
V2 and V3 of V. Therefore, one cannot in general solve the following system of nine inhomogeneous
equations,

∂x1

for the nine arbitrary continuous functions wij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, even if they all vanish outside Ω. These
nine functions must satisfy some (in fact, ﬁve) compatibility conditions. We shall not go further into
this discussion here.

Some applications in Physics
Consider a ﬂuid or a gas of density ̺ and velocity vector ﬁeld v. Let Ωbe a (bounded) domain. Then
the total mass in Ωis
M =

Ω
̺ dΩ,
and the ﬂux of mass through the surface ∂Ω(positive in the direction away from Ω), is given by
q =

∂Ω
̺v · n dS.
Then the law of conservation of mass is written
q dt = −dM.

We get by a rearrangement and an application of Gauß’s theorem,
0 = q + dM

̺v · n dS + d

Ω
̺ dΩ=

div (̺v) + ∂̺

dΩ.
This equation is true for every domain Ω, and since the integrand is continuous, it must be 0, and we
have derived the so-called continuity equation
div (̺v) + ∂̺
∂t = 0,
also written
∂̺
∂t + ▽· (̺v) = 0.
If we restrict ourselves to the stationary case, i.e. ∂̺
∂t = 0, then also ▽· (̺v) = 0, so ̺v is divergence
free. We conclude in this case that there exists a vector potential for ̺v.
I the next special case we furthermore assume in this stationary case that the ﬂuid is incompressible,
which means that its density ̺ is constant. Then clearly ▽· v = 0, so v is divergence free, and there
exists a vector potential A, such that v = ▽× A.
Returning to the general case it should be mentioned that the same mathematical structure can also
be found in other situations in Physics. We list for convenience some of them below.
1) Continuity equation, i.e. the above,
div (̺v) + ∂̺
∂t = 0,
also written ▽·(̺v) + ∂̺
∂t = 0,
where ̺ is the density and v the velocity of a ﬂuid gas.
2) Conservation of energy,
div q + ∂u
∂t = 0,
also written ▽·q + ∂u
∂t = 0,
where u denotes the energy density and q the density of the energy ﬂow.
3) Conservation of electric charge,
div J + ∂̺
∂t = 0,
also written ▽·J + ∂̺
∂t = 0,
where J is the current density and ̺ the density of charge.
As an illustration we let T (x, t) denote the temperature ﬁeld in a body, in which heat is supposed to
be the only transport of energy. Then by the law of conservation of energy above,
▽· q + ∂u
∂t = 0,
where q denotes the density of heat ﬂow, and u is the density of the inner energy.
Assume that the density of heat ﬂow follows Fourier’s law
q = −λ ▽T,

where λ is called the conductivity of heat.
Furthermore, assume that the energy density is given by the temperature alone, such that the following
equation holds,
∂u
∂t = du
dT
∂T
∂t .
By convention we put
du
dT = ̺ c,
thus
∂u
∂t = ̺ c ∂T
∂t ,
where ̺ denotes the density of mass, and c denotes the speciﬁc capacity of heat.
Then we get by insertion,
̺ c ∂T
∂t = ∂u
∂t = −▽·q = −▽·(−λ ▽T ) = ▽λ · ▽T + λ ▽2 T.
We shall restrict ourselves to the case where the conductivity of heat λ is a constant. Then ▽λ = 0,
and we get
̺ c ∂T
∂t = λ ▽2 T,
or by a rearrangement
∂T
∂t = λ
̺ c ▽2 T.
This equation is called the heat equation. The same equation occurs in the case of diﬀusion, in which
case it is called the diﬀusion equation. In civil engineering the same equation is known as Fick’s law.
We shall turn to another physical situation. Consider a large mass of ﬂuid of constant mass density
̺0, and let p denote the pressure in this ﬂuid. Then
p(z) = p(0) + ̺0 g z,
and clearly
▽p = ̺0 g ez,
where g denotes the gravity constant, and the vertical coordinate z is chosen positive downwards in
the same direction as the gravity.
Let a body Ωbe immersed into the ﬂuid. Then the ﬂuid will aﬀect an area element dS of the surface
∂Ωwith a force dF of the size p dS and of a direction perpendicular to the surface ∂Ωinto the body.
By our previously chosen convention we always understand the vector ﬁeld n on the surface ∂Ωas
the outgoing unit normal vector ﬁeld, so we conclude that
dF = −p n dS
on ∂Ω.
Then the total force F acting on Ωis obtained by integrating dF over the surface ∂Ω. This integral
can be calculated by using the third variant of Gauß’s theorem, so
F =

∂Ω
(−p n) dS = −

Ω
▽p dΩ= −̺0 g ez

Ω
dΩ= −̺0 vol(Ω) g ez.
We have thus above derived Archimedes’s theorem, The buoyancy of the ﬂuid acting on the body Ωis
equal to the gravitational force on the superseded ﬂuid.
The moment of the forces M with respect to origo O is obtained by integration of
dM = x × dF = −p x × n dS,

Examples from Electromagnetism
Example 38.4 We know from Maxwell’s equations, cf. Section 35.3, that the electric ﬁeld E and the
magnetic ﬂux density B satisfy the diﬀerential equations
▽× E = −∂B
∂t
and
▽·B = 0.
Since Ω= R3 is star shaped and div B = 0, we conclude that there exists a vector potential A for B,
so
B = ▽× A.
This implies that the magnetic ﬂux Φ through a surface F according to Stokes’s theorem is equal to
the circulation of the vector potential taken along the boundary curve δF, i.e.

F
B · n dS =

F
n · ▽× A dS =

Then, by a rearrangement of the ﬁrst equation above,
0 = ▽× E + ∂B
∂t = ▽× E + ∂
∂t(▽× A) = ▽×

E + ∂A
∂t

.
This result shows that E + ∂A
∂t is rotational free, hence a gradient ﬁeld. Since the domain R3 is star
shaped, there exists a scalar potential V , such that
E + ∂A
∂t = −▽V,
i.e.
E = −∂A
∂t −▽V.
The pair (A, V ) is called the set of electromagnetic potentials. It is left to the reader to give the simple
proof that a set of electromagnetic potentials (A, V ) can be replaced by

A + ▽g, V −∂g
∂t

, where
g(x, y, z, t) is any C1 function. ♦
Example 38.5 Let K denote a closed curve with a current I. We assume that K lies in a magnetic
ﬁeld of constant ﬂux density B. The magnetic ﬁeld acts on the vectorial curve element t ds with the
so-called Laplace force dF = I t × B ds.
The total force F acting on K is given by the line integral

because K is closed, so the initial point r(α) and the end point r(β) are coinciding, r(α) = r(β).
The moment of the forces M is obtained by integrating
dM = x × dF
along the curve K. We note that since the resulting force F = 0, the moment M is independent of
the point O which is used when deﬁning the moment.
We then choose a surface F which has the given curve K as its boundary, K = δF, and adjust the
corresponding orientations. Using the rule of calculation of the double cross product of x × (t × B),
known from Linear Algebra, we ﬁnd
M =

Then we apply the third version of Stokes’s theorem with f = x · B on the ﬁrst integral, and the
ﬁrst version of Stokes’s theorem on the second integral. Since ▽× x = 0, and since B is constant, so
▽(x · B) = B, we get

Example 38.7 Given for a material which is not in an electric sense an ideal isolator,
▽· D = ˜̺,
▽· J + ∂˜̺
∂t = 0,
D = α J,
where D is the electric ﬂux density, J is the ﬂow density, and ˜̺ is the charge density, while α is
a scalar ﬁeld, which describes the electric properties of the material, and t is the time. We further
assume that we are in a stationary case and that we are given a current distribution, so J is a known
vector ﬁeld.
Find an expression of ˜̺.
A Nabla calculus and Electromagnetism.
D Analyze the equations, when J and α are given.
I We ﬁrst derive that
˜̺ = ▽· D = ▽· (α J) = (▽α) · J + α ▽·J.
Since we are in the stationary case, we have
∂˜̺
∂t = 0,
hence
▽· J + ∂˜̺
∂t = 0
implies that ▽· J = 0. Finally, by insertion,
˜̺ = (▽α) · J.

Example 38.8 Considering potentials it can be proved that the electric ﬁeld intensity E and the
magnetic ﬂux density B can be derived from a scalar potential V and a vector potential A in the
following way:
B = ▽× A,
E = −∂A
∂t −▽V.
We also have equations of the same form with another set of potentials ( ˜A, ˜V ), provided that
˜V = V −∂g
∂t ,
˜A + ▽g,
where g is a scalar ﬁeld. We note that the potentials are not uniquely determined, so it is natural to
set up an extra condition on the potentials. One often applies the so-called Lorentz condition
▽· A + ∂V
∂t = 0.
1. Derive the diﬀerential equation which the scalar ﬁeld g must fulﬁl if one from any given set of
potentials ( ˜A, ˜V ) can create a set of potentials (A, V ), which also satisﬁes the Lorentz condition.
It turns up that one can solve this diﬀerential equation. We therefore assume in the following that the
Lorentz condition is satisﬁed, and then consider the vector ﬁeld
Z(x, t) =
 t
t0
A(x, τ) dτ,
where t0 is some constant.
2. Show that if we put V = −▽·Z, then the Lorentz condition is fulﬁlled.
3. Express the electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B by means of the vector ﬁeld Z.
A Set of potentials satisfying the Lorentz condition.
D Insert into the equations. Note that the operator ∂
∂t commutes with the operators ▽, ▽· and ▽×.
I First assume that (A, V ) is given, and let g be a scalar ﬁeld. If
˜V = V −∂g
∂t
and
˜A + ▽g,
then
▽× ˜A = ▽× A + ▽× ▽g = B + 0 = B,
and
−∂˜A
∂t −▽˜V = −∂A

∂t ▽g + ▽

= E + 0 = E,
and we have proved that (A, V ) and ( ˜A, ˜V ) are both a set of potentials for B and E.

1) It follows by a rearrangement that
V = ˜V + ∂g
∂t
and
A = ˜A −▽g,
where the set of potentials ( ˜A, ˜V ) is given. By insertion into the Lorentz condition we get
0 = ▽· A + ∂V
∂t = ▽· ˜A −▽· ▽g + ∂˜V
∂t + ∂2g
∂t2 ,
and we derive the requested diﬀerential equation
▽2g −∂2g
∂t2 = ▽· ˜A + ∂˜V
∂t
where the right hand side is known. This is a classical inhomogeneous wave equation in three
space variables and one time variable.
2) Assume that only the vector ﬁeld A is given. Put
Z(x, t) =

Example 38.10 Change the problem of Example 38.9 in the following way: The two parallel strips
are placed in the same plane. We assume that the strips may be considered as inﬁnitely thin, that the

the distance by a, cf. the ﬁgure. It can be proved that the inductance per length L of this wire is given

2 + b that 0 ≤ξ ≤1, and similarly, 0 ≤η ≤1. Furthermore,
˜x = x corresponds to ξ = η. Finally,

Remark. Since K is chosen among a very special set of curves we can strictly speaking not
conclude the uniqueness. However, the existence is obvious. ♦
2) This is straightforward.
Example 38.12 Consider a double wire, i.e. two parallel conductive cylinders. The direction of the
generator is parallel to the z-axis. We denote the two domains in which the two cylinders intersect
the (x, y)-plane by S1 and S2. We shall also assume the following:
The ﬂow density J of the conductors is parallel to the z-axis, the ﬂows are I and −I, and the perme-
ability µ is constant. It can be proved that we get a vector potential (0, 0, A) by adding contributions
from the two conductors and that the inductance per length L is given by
LI2 =

Show by applying the result of Example 38.11 and a mean value theorem for harmonic functions
that if we consider a double wire consisting of two equal circular cylinders of radius a and distance c

D Sketch a ﬁgure. Add the vector potentials from Example 38.11 in order to ﬁnd J.
Finally,
compute L by showing that some convenient function is harmonic.
I Let S1 be the disc of centrum (0, 0), and S2 the disc of centrum (c, 0), both of radius a, where
c > 2a.

Scalar and vector potentials
Example 38.14
A. Given the divergence free vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) =

3y2z2, xy, −xz

,
(x, y, z) ∈R3.
Since R3 is star-shaped, V has vector potentials W. Find one of these, i.e. ﬁnd W, such that
V = ▽× W = rot W.
D. The usual solution formula of textbooks looks here very harmless, but from my experience of
teaching I can say that i is not that harmless. Therefore we shall give a thorough treatment of this
example.
The method can brieﬂy be described in the following way:
1) Has this exercise been solved earlier in the text?
2) If ‘no’, examine if V(x, y, z) is divergence free.
3) Calculate separately the auxiliary ﬁeld T(x) = V(x) × x.
4) Replace x by τ x. (This is the critical phase of the method).
5) Calculate W0(x) =
 1
0 T(τ x) dτ.
6) Check once more the preassumptions of the method.
7) Check the result.
I. 1) We ﬁrst check if we earlier have solve the problem.
It happens quite often at an examination that one in the ﬁrst part of a problem as a check are
asked to calculate the rotation of e.g. the vector ﬁeld

= V.
Half an hour later one comes to another question in which one is asked to ﬁnd a vector potential
for V. Some students may immediately see that W1 is a solution. Other poor souls have to
go through the following steps:
2) Examine if V(x, y, z) is divergence free.
If not, there is no vector potential, and the problem is solved.
In the example under consideration we get
div V = 0 + x −x = 0,
so we must carry on to the next point.
3) Calculate the auxiliary ﬁeld T(x) = V(x) = ×x.
Be very careful with the order of the factors. And do not yet introduce the parameter τ in the
calculations. It will only confuse the overview.

.
4) Replace x by τ x, y by τ y and z by τ z.
This is the critical step where most errors are made. Be extremely scrupulous here. It may be
useful to note that one in polynomials just add the factor τn to every term which contains n
factors of the type x, y or z (they are considered as equal at this count).
In the case under consideration where T(x) is composed of polynomials we get
T(τ x) =

2τ 3xyz, −τ3x2z −3τ5y2z3, 3τ5y3z2 −t4x2y

,
because xyz, x2z and x2y contain three factors, i.e. we shall multiply by τ 3, while y2z3 and
y3z2 contain ﬁve factors, so here we add the factor τ5.
5) Calculate the candidate
W0(x) =
 1
0
T(τ x) dτ
by a coordinate-wise integration after τ.

.
The expressions are often so enormous that it pays to calculate each coordinate separately. We
see that even in this simple case the equations are huge.
6) If our calculations have been correct – note that 0 must lie in the domain – then W0(x) is a
vector potential for V(x) in every sub-domain of Ω, which can be reached by a radial line in Ω
from 0.
In the case under consideration we see that R3 satisﬁes this criterium, hence
W0(x) =

2 xyz, −1
4 x2z −1
2 y2z3, 1
2 y3z2 −1

is a vector potential in the whole of R3 (if our calculations were without errors, of course).

7) By a comparison we see that we have obtained two diﬀerent solutions, W0(x) in the latter
case and W1(x) in the former one. They are both correct, because their diﬀerence is only a
gradient ﬁeld. Nevertheless this phenomenon often causes some panic after the examination,
because students are used to from high school that the solution is unique. It is not in problems
of this type!
Since the method is so diﬃcult it is highly recommended that one always check every calculation
in exercises of this type. In the present case we get

We have now checked that W0 is a vector potential.
Remark 38.1 If a check does not give the right answer and div V = 0, then we have made an
error at some place, probably at 4) which would be the ﬁrst place where I would search myself.
This does not leave out the possibility of errors in the other steps as well. ♦
Example 38.15 Prove in each of the following cases that the given vector ﬁeld V : R3 →R3 is
divergence free. The ﬁnd a vector potential W : R3 →R3, such that V = ▽× W. (We may not
necessarily consider the points where xyz = 0).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our

Example 38.16 Consider a vector ﬁeld V : A →R2, where A is an open star shaped subset of the
(X, Y )-plane. Furthermore, assume that the ﬁeld V is divergence free.
1) Prove that the vector ﬁeld ez × V is rotation free and that there exists a scalar ﬁeld W : A →R,
such that W ez is a vector potential of V.
2) Prove that a level curve of W is a ﬁeld line of V.
A Vector potential.
D Analyze the text step by step and prove the claims in succession.
I 1) According to the assumption, V : A →R2 is a function of the variable (x, y), which satisﬁes
div V = ∂V1
∂x + ∂V2
∂y = 0.
Deﬁne a vector ﬁeld ˜V by
˜V(x, y, z) = (V1(x, y), V2(x, y), 0) ,
(x, y, z) ∈A × R = ˜A.
Then ˜A is star shaped and ˜V is also divergence free.
We shall in the following only write V instead of the more precise ˜V.
By one of the formulæ of diﬀerentiation of a product,
▽× (ez × V)
=
(V · ▽)ez−V(▽· ez)−(ez · ▽)V+ez(▽· V)
=
0 + 0 −∂
∂z V + div V · ez = 0,
and the vector ﬁeld ez × V is rotation free.
Thus there exists a scalar ﬁeld ˜W : A × R →R, such that
▽˜W =

∂˜W
∂x , ∂˜W
∂y , ∂˜W
∂z

= ez × V = (−V2, V1, 0) .
Since V is independent of z, also ˜W = W must be independent of z, thus we can choose a
scalar ﬁeld W : A →R2, such that
▽W = (−V2, V1, 0) = ez × V.
Furthermore,

(▽W) × ez + W ▽×ez = (ez × V) × ez =

(Alternatively we may twice apply the geometric interpretation of the cross product). This
shows that W ez is a vector potential for V, and we have proved all the claims.

2) A level curve of W is given by
W(x, y) = c,
where the tangent ﬁeld U(x, y) of the level curve satisﬁes
▽W · U = (ez × V) · U = 0.
Clearly, this equation has the solution U = V, thus the level curve is also a ﬁeld line of V.
Example 38.17 Let α be a constant, and let two vector ﬁelds on R3 be given in the following way:
U = (▽f) × (▽g),
W = α (f ▽g −f ▽f).
Show that one can choose α such that W is a vector potential for U.
[Cf. Example 36.12.]
A Vector potential.
D Compute ▽× W and compare with U = ▽f × ▽g.
I By the rules of calculations,
▽× W
=
α ▽×(f ▽g) −α ▽×(g ▽f)
=
α ▽f × ▽g+αf (▽× ▽g)−α ▽g × ▽f −αg (▽× ▽f)
=
α ▽× ▽g + 0 + α ▽f × ▽g + 0
=
2α ▽f × ▽g = 2α U.
We see that if α = 1
2, then W is a vector potential for U.

A The standard formula of computation of a vector potential applied on non-divergence free vector
ﬁelds. The example shall illustrate what can go wrong when the assumptions are not fulﬁlled.
D First note that the given ﬁelds are not divergence free. Then just compute.

Summarizing,
▽× W = V,
and we have proved that W is a vector potential for V.
Remark. The formula of this example of a vector potential in R3 is far easier to apply than the
usual procedure of solution given in most textbooks. ♦

(x, y, z) ∈R3.
1. Compute the divergence ▽· V and the rotation ▽× V.
2. Check if there exists a vector ﬁeld W : R3 →R3, such that V = ▽× W.
Let L = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 | x ≥0, y ≥0, x2 + y2 + z2 ≤9}.

4) a) LetB(0, a) denote the disc in the (X, Y )-plane of centrum (0, 0) and radius A. The union
of the surfaces O and B(0, a) surrounds a simple body Ω.
Since V is divergence fret,
the ingoing ﬂux through O must be equal to the outgoing ﬂux through B(0, a), where
n = (0, 0, −1), hence the ﬂux is

Example 38.23 Consider the vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) = (2x + 3y, 2y + 3x, −4z),
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
and the function
G(x, y, z) = αx2 + βy2 + γz2 + δxy,
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
where α, β, γ, δ are constants.
1. Show that one can choose the constants α, β, γ, δ such that V = ▽G.
2. Compute the tangential line integral

K
V · t ds,
where K is the broken line composed of the two line segments from (2a, 0, a) via (2a, 0, 0) to (a, 0, 0).
3. Show that the vector ﬁeld
W(x, y, z) =

2yz + xz −x2, −2xz −yz + y2, y2 −x2 + z2
,
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
is a vector potential for V.
Let a be a positive constant, and let F be the oriented surface given by
x2 + y2 + z2 = a2,
z ≥0,
with the unit normal vector n pointing away from (0, 0, 0).
4. Find the ﬂux

F
V · n dS.
A Vector analysis, i.e. check the gradient ﬁeld, tangential line integral, vector potential and ﬂux.
D The examples can be solved in many ways, and I have probably not found all variants. Below we
give the following variants:
1) We solve 1) in 5 variants.
2) We solve 2) in 2 variants.
3) We solve 3) in 2 variants.
4) We solve 4) in 4 variants and 1 subvariant (and there are more; we miss e.g. the calculations
when F is a surface of revolution).
I 1) First variant. A simple check.
When we compute ▽G we get
▽G = (2αx + δy, δx + 2βy, 2γz).
Choose α = 1, β = 1, γ = −2 and δ = 3. Then
▽G = (2x + 3y, 3y + 2y, −4z) = V,
and V = ▽G is a gradient ﬁeld with the integral
G(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 −2z2 + 3xy.

that
G(x, y) = x2 + y2 −2z2 + 3xy
is an integral of ▽G = V, and V is a gradient ﬁeld.
Then by comparison, α = 1, β = 1, γ = −2, δ = −3.
Third variant. Indeﬁnite integration.
Put
ω = V · dx = (2x + 3y) dx + (2y + 3x) dy −4z dz.
Then
F1(x, y, z); =

(2x + 3y)dx = x2 + 3xy,
thus
ω −dF1 = (2x+3y) dx + (2y+3x) dy −4z dz −{(2x+3y) dx + 3x dy} = 2y dy −4z dz,
which is reduced to

and we conclude that
G(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 −2z2 + 3xy
is an integral of V, i.e. V = ▽G, and α = 1, β = 1, γ = −2, δ = 3.

gradient ﬁeld.

Fourth variant. Integration along a broken line.
We get by a tangential line integration along the broken line

Since we already have proved that V is a gradient ﬁeld, an integral is given by
G(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 −2z2 + 3xy,
▽G = V,
and we get by comparison that α = 1, β = 1, γ = −2, δ = 3.

is an integral of V, i.e. ▽G = V, and we get by comparison that α = 1, β = 1, γ = −2,
δ = 3.
2) First variant. The gradient theorem.
According to 1), the ﬁeld V is a gradient ﬁeld with the integral
G(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 −2z2 + 3xy.
Then by the gradient theorem,

K
V · t ds = G(a, 0, 0) −G(2a, 0, a) = a2 −(4a2 −2a2) = −a2.
Second variant. Line integral.
We have on the line segment from (2a, 0, a) to (2a, 0, 0) that x = 2a and y = 0, while z runs
through the interval [0, a] from a to 0 (the reverse direction).
On the line segment from (2a, 0, 0) to (a, 0, 0), the variable x runs through the interval
[a, 2a] from 2a towards a, also in the reverse direction, while y = 0 and z = 0.

Example 38.24 Given the two functions
L(x, y) = ey + y(ex −exy),
(x, y) ∈R2,
M(x, y) = ex + x(ey −exy),
(x, y) ∈R2.
1) Prove that the vector ﬁeld V(x, y) = (L(x, y), M(x, y)), (x, y) ∈R2, is a gradient ﬁeld, and ﬁnd
all integrals of V.
2) Show that the vector ﬁeld
U(x, y, z) = (z M(x, y), −z L(x, y), L(x, y) + M(x, y)),
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
is not a gradient ﬁeld, while there exists a vector potential for U. (One shall not ﬁnd such a vector
potential).
A Gradient ﬁeld, vector potential.
D We shall prove in three ways that V is a gradient ﬁeld. That U has a vector potential is shown
by means of the necessary and suﬃcient conditions.
I 1) First note that L(x, y) and M(x, y) are of class C∞in all of R2.
First method. Manipulation.
By means of the rules of calculations we get by some manipulation,
L dx + M dy = {ey+y(ex−exy)} dx + {ex+x(ey−exy)} dy
=
{ey dx+xey dy} + {yex dx+ex dy} −exy{y dx+x dy}
=
{ey dx+x d (ey)} + {y d (ex)+ex dy} −exy d(xy)
=
d (xey) + d (yex) −d (exy) = d (xey + yex −exy)
=
▽F · ( dx, dy).
Hence (L(x, y), M(x, y)) is a gradient ﬁeld and its integrals are given by
F(x, y) = xey + yex −exy + C,
C arbitrary constant.
Second method. Indeﬁnite integration.
We ﬁrst get
F1(x, y) =

L(x, y) dx =

{ey + y(ex −exy)} dx = xey + yex −exy.
Then by a check
∂F1
∂y = xey+ex−xexy = ex+x(ey−exy) = M(x, y),
which shows that (L(x, y), M(x, y)) is a gradient ﬁeld and that its integrals are
F(x, y) = F1(x, y) + C = xey + yex −exy + C,
(x, y) ∈R2,
where C is an arbitrary constant.

Third method. Integration along a broken line followed by a check.
When we integrate L dx + M dy along the broken line
(0, 0) −→(x, 0) −→(x, y),
we get the candidate
F(x, y)
=
 x

L(t, 0) dt +

tex + xet −exty
0 = x + yex + xey −exy −x + 1
=
yex + xey −exy + 1.
By testing (this is mandatory by this method) we get
∂F
∂x = yex + ey −yexy = ey + y(ex −exy) = L(x, y),
∂F
∂y = ex + xey −xexy = ex + x(ey −exy) = M(x, y).
It follows from the above that (L(x, y), M(x, y)) is a gradient ﬁeld and that its integrals are
F(x, y) = xey + yex −exy + C,
C an arbitrary constant.
2) Now
∂
∂z {z M(x, y)} = M(x, y) = ex + x(ey −exy)
and
∂
∂x {L(x, y) + M(x, y)} = yex −y2exy + ex −exy −xyexy = ∂
∂z {z M(x, y)},
so the necessary conditions for a gradient ﬁeld are not satisﬁed, and U is not a gradient ﬁeld.
Clearly, U is of class C∞in all of R3, and R3 is star shaped. (It is even convex.)
As (L, M) is a gradient ﬁeld, we have in particular
∂L
∂y = ∂M
∂x ,
thus
div U = z ∂M
∂x −z ∂L
∂y + 0 = z
∂M
∂x −∂L
∂y

= 0,
and U is divergence free and deﬁned in a star shaped domain.
Therefore U has a vector
potential.
Remark. In principal the integrals of the formula of the vector potential can be computed.
However, the result is very diﬃcult to manage with a lot of exceptional cases. For this reason
it is highly recommended always to ﬁnd some other method before one tries to ﬁnd the vector
potential by means of the standard formulæ. ♦

hence by integration
G(x, z) = 1

and by a rearrangement

2 z2 −ϕ2(z) = 1
2 x2 −ϕ1(x) = constant,
so
G(x, z) = 1

Remark.
Alternatively we should ﬁrst note that U is divergence free in the star shaped
(convex) domain R3 containing 0. This implies the existence of the vector potentials and that
one of these can be found by the formula
W0(x) =

2.
2. As rot V = 0 and R3 is star shaped (it is even convex), V is a gradient ﬁeld. Its integrals may
be found in one of the following three ways:
First variant. Indeﬁnite integration.
F1(x, y, z) =

Vx(x, y, z) dx =

ey sin z dx = x ey sin z,
where
▽F1 = (ey sin z, x ey sin z, x ey cos z) = V,
proving that F1 is an integral of V and all integrals are given by
F(x, y, z) = x ey sin z + C,
C arbitrary constant.
Second variant. Manipulation, using the rules of calculations. It follows immediately from
V · dx
=
ey sin z dx + xey sin z dy + xey cos z dz
=
ey · sin z dx + x · sin z · d (ey) + xey d(sin z)
=
d (xey sin z) = d (xey sin z + C) ,
that the integrals are given by
F(x, y, z) = x ey sin z + C,
C arbitrary constant.

Third variant. Integration along a broken line
(0, 0, 0) −→(x, 0, 0) −→(x, y, 0) −→(x, y, z).

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
39.1
Harmonic functions
We shall in this chapter prove some important consequences of Gauß’s theorem. We shall start with
noting that in connection with potentials – one of the subjects of Chapter 38 – we had to consider
Poisson’s equation
▽2w = p,
where p(x) is a given function (a scalar ﬁeld). Poisson’s equation is one of the classical (inhomogeneous)
elliptic partial diﬀerential equations. We mention without proof that in order to secure a unique
solution in a given domain Ωwe must also have given the boundary conditions on ∂Ω, which in the
following is assumed to consist of one or more surfaces, i.e. we exclude the case, in which ∂Ωcontains
isolated points. Then the above means that we require that the solution w of Poisson’s equation is of
class C2 in the interior Ω◦of Ωand continuous on Ω(almost everywhere) with
w(x) = q(x)
for x ∈∂Ω,
where q(x) is a given function, continuous almost everywhere on the boundary ∂Ω. We note the
special case, when Ω= Rn is the whole space. In this case ∂Ω= ∅, and the Poisson equation does
not have a unique solution.
In the initial study of the Poisson equation we assume for simplicity that we do not have any boundary
condition, so we do not have uniqueness in this case. However, if w1 and w2 are two solutions of
Poisson’s equation, i.e.
▽2w1 = p
and
▽2 w2 = p,
then it follows from the linearity of the diﬀerential operator ▽2 that
▽2 (w1 −w2) = ▽2w1 −▽2w2 = p −p = 0,
so the diﬀerence between any two solutions of Poisson’s equation for the same given p(x) must be a
solution of the so-called Laplace equation,
▽2w = 0,
which is the classical homogeneous elliptic partial diﬀerential equation. It occurs in so many applica-
tions that it has been thoroughly studied during the last centuries, and there exists a large literature
on this matter. Here we shall not go into details in the theory of linear partial diﬀerential operators,
though we shall need some of the structure of the solutions, so we introduce
Deﬁnition 39.1 An harmonic function in an open set Ω◦is a solution of the Laplace equation in
Ω◦, i.e. the function w(x) is harmonic in Ω◦, if
▽2w = 0
in Ω◦.
Every solution of Poisson’s equation ▽2w = p in Ω◦is then given by one particular solution of this
equation plus an harmonic function.
In the plane R2 the harmonic functions are connected with the Theory of Complex Functions. We
shall in this chapter mostly consider harmonic functions in ordinary space R3, so if nothing else is
speciﬁed, we tacitly consider an open domain Ω◦⊆R3.

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
Deﬁnition 39.2 Given a body (containing interior points) Ω⊂R3 with a piecewise smooth boundary
∂Ω= ∅. Let n denote the outgoing unit normal vector ﬁeld on the boundary ∂Ω. Finally, let f be of
class C1 in a neighbourhood of (a part of) the boundary ∂Ω. We deﬁne the normal derivative of f on
(a part of) the boundary ∂Ωby
∂f
∂n = n · ▽f.
Clearly, the normal derivative of the function f indicates the change of f at the boundary point under
consideration in the outgoing direction perpendicular to the boundary.
Let us assume that the function f is harmonic in an open set U, which contains the closure Ωof the
domain Ω, i.e. Ω◦= ∅and Ω⊂U. Since ▽2f = 0, it follows immediately from Gauß’s theorem that

so we have proved the important

Ω⊂U, the surface integral over the boundary ∂Ωof the normal derivative of f is always 0,

Green’s ﬁrst identity
Let f and g be of class C2 in an open set U, which contains the closure Ωof some domain Ω. It
follows from one of the rules of computation for ▽that
▽· (g ▽f) = g ▽2 f + ▽g · ▽f,

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
A simple application of Green’s ﬁrst identity is a uniqueness theorem for the Poisson equation.
Theorem 39.2 Uniqueness theorem for the Poisson equation. Let Ω⊂R3 be an open set with a
nonempty boundary ∂Ωconsisting of piecewise smooth surfaces. Let p be a function in Ω, and let q be
a function on the boundary ∂Ω. If the boundary value problem for the Poisson equation has a solution
w,
▽2w = p
in Ω,
and
w = q
on ∂Ω,
then this solution is unique.
Remark 39.1 Note that the theorem does not say anything of the existence of a solution. If p or q
are not continuous, such a solution may not exist. ♦
Proof. Let us assume that both w1 and w2 are solutions of this boundary value problem for the
Poisson equation. If we put f = w1 −w2, it follows from the linearity of the problem that
▽2f = ▽2w1 −▽2w2 = p −p = 0
on Ω◦,
and
f = w1 −w2 = q −q = 0
on ∂Ω.
When we put g = f in Green’s ﬁrst identity, we get

because ▽2f = 0 on Ω◦, and f = 0 on ∂Ω. Hence

Ω
 ▽f2 dΩ= 0.
The function f = w1 −w2 is of class C2, so  ▽f2 ≥0 is continuous. The integral can only become
zero, if  ▽f2 = 0, which implies that ▽f = 0, so f is constant. Since f is continuous on Ω, and
f = 0 on ∂Ω, we conclude that f = w1 −w2 = 0, and the uniqueness is proved. 
39.3
Green’s second identity
Let f, g ∈C2(U), where U ⊆R3 is an open set, and let Ωbe a set, such that Ω⊂U, and ∂Ωconsists

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
Theorem 39.3 Green’s second identity. Assume that f, g ∈C2(U), where U ⊆R3 is an open set,

We shall use Green’s second identity to prove the following
Theorem 39.4 Mean value theorem for harmonic functions in space. Let f be harmonic in an open
set U, and let P ∈U be a given point. Then the value f(P) of f at the point P equal to the mean
value of f over any ball or sphere of centrum P and contained in U. In the case of the sphere all
points inside this sphere should also be contained in U.
Proof. Let the point P ∈U be given. By translation we may assume that P is 0. Let f be harmonic
in U, i.e.
▽2f = 0
in U,
and choose the radius a > 0, such that the closed ball B[0, a] ⊂U. The trick is to choose a convenient
function g in U.

Since 4πa2 is the area of the sphere ∂B[0, a], this shows that the mean value of the harmonic function

We shall in the following exploit this remarkable identity. The given harmonic function f cannot be

on every sphere of centrum 0. We choose the harmonic function
g = 1

Let f be harmonic in the set Ω. If f is not a constant, then f cannot have an extremum at an interior
point P ∈Ω◦. In fact, assume e.g. that P is a maximum point. For convenience we translate the
coordinate system, such that P = 0. Then choose r > 0, such that
f(x) < f(0),
for some points, for which x < r.
Then the mean value theorem is clearly violated, so the assumption that 0 was a maximum point was
wrong. In particular, it follows that maxima and minima for harmonic functions in Ωare always to
be found on the boundary ∂Ω. This property is called the maximum-minimum principle for harmonic
functions.
Green’s identities above have only been stated for scalar ﬁelds. One may obtain similar formulæ for
vector ﬁelds, where we start with the expressions ▽· (W × (▽× V)). The analogue vectorial version

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities

Green’s third identity
Let Ωbe a bounded set with 0 as an interior point, 0 ∈Ω◦. Let f be a function of class C2 in an open
set U ⊃Ω. We do not assume that f is harmonic, so in general, ▽2f = 0. If we choose the auxiliary
function g = 1
r for r = 0, then ▽2g = 0, so g is harmonic.
Figure 39.1: The set Ωand the subset Ω(b), where we have cut a solid ball B[0, b] out of Ω. We apply
Green’s second identity on Ω(b) with g = 1
r in the proof of Green’s third identity.
Choose b > 0, such that B := B[0, b] ⊂Ω.
Then we apply Green’s second identity on the set
Ω(b) = Ω\ B, where we note that
∂Ω(b) = ∂Ω∪∂B.

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
39.5
Green’s identities in the plane
In the plane case, i.e. in R2, we get some similar identities, which can also be derived by instead
applying the theory of harmonic functions in the Theory of Complex Functions. This is not done here.
The ﬁrst two of Green’s identities are formally identical with the identities given previously in this
chapter. The only diﬀerence is that we only use two coordinates (x, y) instead of three, (x, y, z). The
proofs of these identities are identical with those given in the three-dimensional case. There is no need
to repeat all this here.
The diﬀerence in structure can be seen in Green’s third identity in the plane, which we here quote
without being too precise with the assumptions. (Just take more or less the same assumptions as in

Gradient, divergence and rotation in semi-polar and spherical coor-
dinates
We shall in this section quote – without proofs – the formulæ for the gradient, the divergence, and
the rotation in R3 in the three standard coordinate systems, the rectangular (x, y, z), the semi-polar
̺, ϕ, z) and the spherical (r, θ, ϕ), coordinate systems.
First recall that we in rectangular coordinates refer to the orthonormal system (ex, ey, ez) of unit basis
vectors, and we found that
gradf = ▽f =
∂f

We expect similar structures in semi-polar coordinates and spherical coordinates.
Figure 39.2: The orthonormal system (e̺, eϕ, ez) of unit vectors for semi-coordinates.
In semi-polar coordinates we also have an orthonormal system (e̺, eϕ, ez) of unit basis vectors, i.e.
they are mutually perpendicular to each other, cf. Figure 39.2. Since eϕ = 1, while the rectangular
coordinates x = ̺ cos ϕ and y = ̺ sin ϕ includes a scaling with the factor ̺, we may expect that ̺
enters the formulæ in semi-polar coordinates of the gradient, the divergence and the rotation. This is
true, and it can be proved that we have

Finally, we also have an orthonormal system (rr, eθ, eϕ) in spherical coordinates. Here, er at a point
(x, y, z) is pointing in the direction speciﬁed, when only r varies, while θ and ϕ are kept ﬁxed, and
similarly for eθ and rϕ. The formulæ are

It should be added that for a given function f the gradient ▽f is a geometrical object and as such
independent of the chosen coordinate system. It is the coordinates which changes, when we choose
another orthonormal basis.

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
39.7
Examples of applications of Green’s identities
Example 39.1 Consider a bounded domain Ω⊂R3 with its boundary consisting of m + 1 disjoint
surfaces F0, F1, . . . , Fm, such that F0 surrounds all the others.
We shall ﬁnd a function w, which in Ω0 fulﬁls Poisson’s equation
▽2w = p,
and which has constant values on the surfaces F0, F1, . . . , Fm. Let Φi denote the ﬂux of ▽w through
Fi, i.e.
Φi =

Fi
∂w
∂n dS.
1. Let the function p be given, and assume that w is zero on F0, and for each i ∈{1, . . ., m} either
Φi or the value of w is given.
Show that w is uniquely determined.
Let Ωbe an unbounded domain with its boundary consisting of m disjoint and bounded surfaces F1,
. . . , Fm. Then the uniqueness theorem proved above also holds when the condition on F0 is replaced
by the following:
There exist positive constants C1, C2, such that
x |w(x)| ≤C1
and
x2 ▽w(x) ≤C2
for all x ∈Ω.
2. Prove this by considering Ω(R) = Ω∩K(0; R) and then let R tend to plus inﬁnity.
A Uniqueness theorem for a mixed Dirichlet/Neumann problem for Poisson’s equation.
D Assume that w and ˜w are solutions. Put f = v −˜w and apply Green’s ﬁrst identity by choosing
g = f and applying that f(x) = 0 on every Fi.
In 2) we estimate the integrand in

∂Ω(R) f ∂f
∂n dS.
Remark 1. The example is dealing with a uniqueness theorem within a smaller class of functions
than the mathematically most natural class. Therefore, one cannot expect that there actually
exists a solution within this class. The problem is that the Neumann problem in some cases is
diﬃcult to treat. However, we can succeed if we have a boundary surface Fi with a Dirichlet
condition instead, i.e. f(x) = αi on Fi. The situation is worse if we are given the ﬂux Φi on Fi,
because then we cannot in general conclude that f(x) is equal to some (unknown) constant on Fi.
This is in general not the case, so we shall usually only expect to be able to show the uniqueness
and not the existence of a solution within the given class of functions. ♦

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
Since  ▽f2 is continuous and nonnegative, we must have ▽f = 0, and we conclude that f is
a constant. Now, f is continuous and zero on the boundary, so f must be identical zero, thus
w = ˜w, and we have proved the uniqueness in the bounded case.
Remark 2. Note that the ﬂux Φi through some of the surfaces Fi does not enter the argument
at all, since we are only using the strong additional condition that w(x) = αi (the same though
unknown constant) for i /∈{i1, . . . , ik}. Hence the problem is formally over-determined, since
we do not apply all our information. (If this information is not in agreement with that we
only get the zero solution, we clearly have a problem. This illustrates what is mathematically
“wrong” with this example). ♦
2) Then consider the unbounded case with the additional growth conditions as a replacement of
the missing surface F0.
When we take the intersection of Ωwith the ball K(0; R), we get a bounded domain Ω(R). It
is left to the reader to sketch the situation on a ﬁgure.
Then split the boundary of Ω(R) in the following way
A(R) = K(0; R) ∩
k
j=1
Fij,
B(R) = K(0; R) ∩

i/∈{i1,...,ik}
Fi,
C(R) = ∂K(0; R) \ {A(R) ∪B(R)},
where we have Dirichlet conditions on Fi for i ∈{i1, . . . , ik} and Neumann conditions on Fi for
i /∈{i1, . . . , ik}. Apart from the fact that we do not know the behaviour on C(R), the problem
can with some modiﬁcations be written as in (39.1).
Let w and ˜w be solutions.
We again put f = w −˜w.
Then f satisﬁes (39.2) with the
modiﬁcations that A ∪B = ∂Ωis replaced by A(R) ∪B(R) [⊆∂ΩR], and Fi is replaced by
Fi ∩K(0; R).
Choose as before g = f in Green’s ﬁrst identity. Then

it follows from the boundary value that f(x) = 0 for x ∈Ω, hence w(x) = ˜w(x) in Ω, and we
have proved the uniqueness.

Note that we do not assume that w is constant on the Neumann boundaries.
Assuming that p and h are nice functions we can prove that we have both an existence and a
uniqueness theorem for the problem. For the pure Dirichlet problem the proof is classical known.
However, if just one Neumann boundary occurs, the proof becomes very diﬃcult. One shall e.g.
apply Hopf’s maximum principle: In a connected domain Ωa non-constant harmonic function
w only attains its maximum values (if they exist) on the boundary ∂Ω, and we have at such a

Overview of Green’s theorems in the plane
For completeness we here include a small section, where Gauß’s and Stokes’s theorems are “translated”
to the 2-dimensional case.
In this case they are called Green’s theorems in the plane.
They are
applicable at the most strange places in the technical sciences, so they ought to be more emphasized
in the textbooks.
Conventions for Green’s theorems in the plane:
Let ∂E be a closed and plane curve without double points. The orbital direction for ∂E is always
chosen such that the domain E to the left of ∂E, is bounded.
The direction of the tangent is determined by the orbital direction, so t is unique. The normal is
always directed away from E, so n is also uniquely determined.
Theorem 39.6 Green’s theorems in the plane:
1) Gauß-like:

2) Stokes-like:

Miscellaneous examples
We collect in this section some examples which are relevant and yet could not be included in the
previous chapters.
Example 39.4 The plane domain on the ﬁgure S is the union of three rectangles, and it is symmetric
with respect to the y-axis.
1. Find the barycentre for each of the three rectangles.
2. Find the barycentre B for S.
The dotted line is indicating the y-axis, and the x-axis is put through B.
3. Compute the axial moment
Ia =

S
y2 dS.
4. Compute Ia and the area of S for a =
√
3 cm. The moment is given in four decimals.
A Barycentre and axial moment.
D Find the barycentre and compute the plane integral.
I Assume that S is covered homogeneously. Choose the y-axis as the axis of symmetry, and the lower
edge of the ﬁgure as the x-axis. Then all three barycentres lie on the y-axis.
1) Put S = S1 ∪S2 ∪S3, where S1 is the upper, S2 the middle and S3 the lower rectangle. Clearly,
of symmetric reasons,
y1 = a + 5a + 1
2 · 2a = 7a,
area(S1) = 8a2,
y2 = a + 1
2 · 5a = 7

where yi denotes the ordinate of the corresponding barycentre. We see in particular that
area(S) = (8 + 5 + 7)a2 = 20a2.
2) Let y denote the ordinate of B. Then
y · area(S) = y1 · area(S1) + y2 · area(S2) + y3 · area(S3),

Example 39.5 Consider for every a ∈R+ the set

Let the vector ﬁeld V : R3 →R3 be given by

3. Find the ﬂux of V through the boundary ∂La.
Let Fa denote that part of ∂La, which is given by x2 + y2 = az and z ≤a, and let n denote the
outward unit normal vector ﬁeld of the surface Fa.
4. Find the ﬂux

Furthermore, let the vector ﬁeld W : R3 →R3 be given by

and put U = V + W.
5. Show that the vector ﬁeld U is a gradient ﬁeld and ﬁnd all its integrals.
A Volume; mass; ﬂux; gradient ﬁeld.
D Sketch La. Then follow the guidelines. Apply Gauß’s theorem, and possibly also Stokes’s theorem.
Finally, show that U · dx is a total diﬀerential.

Hence along ∂Fa,
V(t) =

t ∈[0, 2π].
When we consult the ﬁgure we see that the orientation is pointing in the wrong direction, so
in order to obtain an outward normal we must multiply by a factor −1:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

and the minimum is
f(x, 0) = f(0, y) = 0.
Alternatively we may ﬁnd the possible stationary points follows by an examination of the

The possible stationary points satisfy V(x, y) = 0, thus
xy(1 + xy)

(y, x) = (0, 0).
We thus get three possibilities:
x = 0,
y = 0,
or
xy−1.
In the interior of A we get
{(x, 0) | x ∈] −2, 2[}
and
{(0, y) | y ∈] −2, 2[},
because the hyperbola xy = −1 only intersects A in the boundary points (1, 1) and (−1, 1) in
∂A.
The boundary is symmetric with respect to (0, 0).
As F(−x, −y) = F(x, y), it suﬃces to
consider the following boundary curves
x + y = 2,
x ∈[0, 2],
and
x −y = 2,
x ∈[0, 2].

Harmonic functions and Green’s identities
Example 39.7 Given a C1-function U(x), x ∈A, where A ⊆R3, and consider a curve such that x
is a function in time t. The curve is determined by the diﬀerential equation
x′′(t) + ▽U(x(t)) = 0,
where ′ denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to t.
Prove by using the chain rule that
1
2 x′2 + U = C,
where C is a constant. (This diﬀerential equation is called a ﬁrst integral of the above because the
order is reduced by 1).
In Mechanics, x(t) can be interpreted as the path of a particle in a ﬁeld of the potential U; then the
two diﬀerential equations express Newton’s second law and the energy theorem.
A Derivation of the ﬁrst integral.
D When we analyze the desired result, we see that here occurs x′2 = x′ · x′, which roughly
speaking means that we must have “something like x2”. Hence, the idea must be to take the
dot product between the ﬁrst diﬀerential equation and x′(t) follows by an integration over the
parameter interval I = [t0, t].

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. It is highly recommended
that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by heart.
40.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occur very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
40.2
Powers etc.

Remark 40.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 40.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days. It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 40.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 40.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 40.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 40.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.

sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x −y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) −sinh(x) sinh(y).

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
