This section delves into the nuances of advanced IAM
policies and permissions in AWS.
Understanding IAM Policies
IAM policies are documents that define permissions and can
be attached to IAM identities (users, groups, and roles).
They control what actions are allowed or denied on what
AWS resources. These policies are written in JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) and consist of elements like
Effect, Action, Resource, and Condition.
Structure of IAM Policies
IAM policies typically contain the following elements:

●Effect: Specifies whether the policy allows or denies
access.
●Action: Lists the specific actions that are allowed or
denied.
●Resource: Specifies the AWS resources to which the
actions apply.
●Condition: Defines the circumstances under which the
policy grants or denies permission.
Policy Evaluation Logic
AWS evaluates these policies when a principal (user or role)
makes a request. Policies are evaluated in order, starting
with explicit deny, then explicit allow, and finally, if no
explicit allow or deny is found, the request is implicitly
denied.
Advanced Policy Elements
Advanced policies in IAM use complex elements to create
granular and specific permissions.
Wildcards in Actions and Resources
Wildcards (*) can be used in Action and Resource
elements to allow or deny multiple actions or resources. For
instance, "Action": "s3:*" would apply to all Amazon S3
actions.
