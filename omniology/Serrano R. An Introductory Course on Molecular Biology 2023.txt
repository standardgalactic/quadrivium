I want to thank the many students of the grade on Biotechnology at the 
Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), Spain, who attended my courses 
on Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, because by answering my 
questions and asking me questions they helped to clarify a lot of concepts. 
 
I want to recognize the work of the architect Rafael Ligorit for the layout of 
the book. Thanks also, to Hilario Teruel, consul of Burkina Faso, who 
always encouraged me to finish this book, my son Ramón, a professional 
translator, and proof reader Laurence Fenton, for a full correction of the 
manuscript. Last, but not least, thanks to the computer scientist Ramón 
Nogales who helped a lot with the computer work. Organizations such as 
Wikipedia, ResearchGate and others that offer figures and illustrations free 
of copyright on the internet have been very useful, especially given the 
enormous amounts of money demanded by some editorials for reproduction 
of figures and illustrations.

Research Institute on Molecular and Cellular Plant Biology (IBMCP) for 
providing me the opportunity to teach and enabling me to continue research 
after retirement as Emeritus Professor. 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
This book is intended to introduce students and scholars to Molecular 
Biology, the modern approach to living organisms that has revolutionized 
biology and generated novel biotechnological applications. The best text 
book in the field of Molecular Biology is that of Berg, Tymoczkko, Gatto 
and Stryer (2015). However, that book is a mixture of Biochemistry and 
Molecular Biology, which in my opinion are not the same thing.  
 
 
I want to pinpoint in this introduction two great paragraphs from Steven 
Pinker (2018, page 378): 
 
Any curriculum will be pedagogically ineffective if it consists of a lecturer 
yammering in front of a blackboard, or a textbook that students highlight 
with a yellow marker. People understand concepts only when they are 
forced to think them through. A second impediment to effective teaching is 
that pupils don’t spontaneously transfer what they learned from a concrete 
example to another in the same abstract category. 
 
Science is not a game with an arbitrary rulebook; it’s the application of 
reason to explaining the universe and to ascertaining whether its 
explanations are true. 
 
Finally, we should consider the thinking of the great Russian science fiction 
author Ivan Efremov (1952, 2): 
 
The school must teach the latest knowledge. A lot of time is wasted teaching 
past things. 
 
Another consideration is that the best way to think about a subject is to 
discuss it frequently with others, as Socrates and Plato did. For example, an 
isolated person like the one in the figure below gets bored while the group 
in the figure below has a good time.  

Introduction

Finally, Albert Einstein said once that: “You do not really understand 
something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.” 
I would also like to make a digression about scientific literature. The 
Thomson Reuters impact factor of a journal in 2022 is calculated as follows:
A = citations in 2022 in all journals to articles published in journal X during 
2020 and 2021.
B = number of articles published in journal X during 2020 and 2021.
Then the 2022 impact factor of journal X is A/B.
This method has some problems: (a) the citation period of only 2 years 
discriminates against papers that are slow to be accepted; and (b) it does not 
correct for the size of one scientific field (for example, biomedicine is much 
larger than plant sciences). A fashionable field has more journals that could 
provide citations (A above), but one particular journal might publish a 
similar number of articles in all fields (B above)
Other classifications of journals are: (a) journals with no publication fee 
(with the exception of color figures) but where institutions must pay to have 
access to the digital form of the journal or to receive the printed form in the 
library; and (b) journals with expensive publication fees (from €2,000 up to 
€10,000). These are the Open Access journals. In the latter case, some 
potential authors of articles may be excluded based on financial but not 
scientific criteria.
Randy W. Schekman, the 2013 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology and 
Medicine from the University of California at Berkeley, has said: “Pressure 
to publish in luxury journals encouraged researchers to cut corners and 
pursue trendy fields of science instead of doing more important work. The 
problem was exacerbated by editors who were not active scientists but 
professionals who stimulated studies that were likely to make a splash”.

In order to evaluate the scientific production of scientists, Jorge E. Hirsch, 
presently professor of Physics at the University of California at San Diego, 
USA, proposed the “h index” (Hirsch 2005, 16569-16572). This is defined 
as the number of articles with a QXPEHURIFLWDWLRQVh. A scientist has an 
“h index” of X if X of his N articles have at least X citations each, and the 
other N-X papers have < X citations. It is calculated by ordering 
publications by decreasing number of citations. See an example below.
How to calculate the “h index” of an author:
The advantage of this index is that the impact factor of the journals does not 
matter because journals with a high impact factor may have poor articles 
with few citations. The important thing is the number of citations received 
by the articles of one scientist, independently of the impact factor of the 
journals where the articles are published.

CHAPTER 1 
WHAT IS MOLECULAR BIOLOGY? 
 
 
 
1.1 What is not and what is Molecular Biology 
Molecular Biology is not the study of the molecules of living organisms. 
Biochemistry, also called Biological Chemistry, fits this definition because 
it studies biological molecules and their chemical reactions in cells 
(metabolism). The adjective “Molecular” before Biology does not refer to 
all molecules of living organisms but only to the two crucial ones: nucleic 
acids and proteins (structural and catalytic, as well as motors, membrane 
transporters and regulators). Molecular Biology is not the classical study 
of genes. This corresponds to Genetics, which deals with genes in relation 
to heredity, loci and genetic variation. 
 
Molecular Biology is an approach to biological phenomena that is based 
on the atomic structures and genetic modifications of the mechanisms and 
physiological functions of the two crucial molecules for life: nucleic acids 
(DNA and RNA) and proteins. It is a reductionist approach derived from 
Biochemistry and from Genetics and it has developed a specific tool called 
Genetic Engineering (also known as Recombinant DNA Technology) to 
isolate genes, modify them in vitro and reintroduce them into organisms to 
investigate the physiological functions of genes and encoded proteins. It 
has also developed physical methods to determine the atomic structure and 
mechanism of these macromolecules. In X-Ray Diffraction, ordered 
molecules in fibers or crystals give a three-dimensional atomic picture of 
nucleic acids and proteins. More recently, in Cryo-Electron Microscopy 
(cryo-EM), many pictures of single, unordered molecules at liquid helium 
temperature are combined to provide similar atomic pictures of 
macromolecules because at such low temperatures the molecules are static, 
and without need of crystallization. Both Genetic Engineering and 
structural methods require a specific informatics approach: Bioinformatics, 
which is crucial to generate and utilize the big data provided by the above 
methods.

Some time ago, the physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937, Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry 1908, Figure 1.1) said the following: “All science is either 
Physics or stamp collecting”. He was right because Physiology is fantasy, 
just correlations without cause-effect connections, Biochemistry may be an 
artefact because it consists of just “in vitro” studies and Genetics is just 
phenotypes and loci and does not reach the molecular level (genes and 
proteins). However, Molecular Biology has raised Biology to the level of an 
exact science because Genetic Engineering can prove hypotheses about the 
functions of genes and proteins, and structural studies of nucleic acids and 
proteins can demonstrate their mechanisms.

Genetic Engineering can be used to generate mutants of specific genes 
with either gain-of-function (over-expression) or loss-of-function (knock-
out) and then check the phenotypes of the organisms. If a function of an 
organism is worsened by the loss of function of a gene, this is a proof of 
the role of the gene and its corresponding protein in this function. If a 
function of an organism is improved by the gain of function of a gene, this 
is a demonstration that this gene and its corresponding protein not only 
participate in this function but that they are rate-limiting.  
 
Molecular Biology explains “what is life”, the question and title of a 
famous 1944 book of Erwin Schrödinger, by testing hypotheses thanks to 
Genetic Engineering and uncovering biological mechanisms at the atomic 
level thanks to X-Ray Crystallography and Cryo-Electron Microscopy. 
These methodologies provide biotechnological tools such as transgenic 
organisms and rational drug design.

1.2 Gene nano-programs and protein nano-machineries 
explain the hallmarks of life 
The mystery of life has always intrigued scientists. With regards to the 
chemical activities of organisms, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob 
Berzelius proposed in 1815 that organic compounds (those made by 
organisms) could only be produced by a God-given “vital force”. But a 
German disciple of Berzelius, Friedrich Wöhler, synthesized urea in the 
laboratory in 1828, without the use of animals, and so dispelled the need 
of a mysterious vital force.  
  
 
However, the chemical activities of organisms (metabolism) are relatively 
simple functions of life and cells are much more complex than just a bag 
of enzymes (the biological catalysts). 
 
The six hallmarks of life, as adapted from SCIENCEFACTS,  
https://www.scifacts.net/biology/what-is-life/, are: 
 
1. Carbon-based and cellular organization  
 
Living things are made from organic compounds (carbon-based); 
 
they are composed of cells and are either unicellular or multi-
 
cellular. 
2. Reproduction and heredity 
Asexual or sexual reproduction, the later involving the joining of 
 gametes or sex cells. Daughter cells and children organisms 
inherit  features from mother cells and parent organisms, 
respectively. 
3. Metabolism 
 
The chemical reactions of living things; nutrients are taken and 
 
utilized as sources of energy (catabolism) and as sources of pillars 
 
to build up cell components (anabolism). 
4. Growth and development 
Cells enlarge and divide; development of multi-cellular organisms 
occurs by growth and differentiation of cells. 
5. Response to stimuli and homeostasis 
 
Cells and organisms make changes in response to external stimuli 
 
to keep their internal environment within a narrow range. 
 
 

Chapter 1

6. Adaptation and evolution 
 
Variation of individuals is important for adaptation of species to 
 
certain environments; selection of adaptation traits is the basis for 
 
evolution. 
 
Living things have all these features, while other beings, such as viruses, 
demonstrate only a few of these characteristics, specifically numbers 2 and 
6 above, and are not living organisms. Because all living things have these 
common features (the hallmarks of life) and utilize the same basic 
molecules, nucleic acids and proteins as key molecules and carbohydrates 
and lipids as secondary ones, it has been proposed that all present 
organisms derived from a single ancestral cell called LUCA (Last 
Universal Common Ancestor), who lived about 4 billion years ago, see 
https://phys.org/news/2018-12-luca-universal-common-ancestor.html). 
 
The emerging picture of Molecular Biology is a scientific understanding of 
the complexity of life with no need to invoke mysterious forces in 
organisms (“vitalism” theories). Molecular Biology was born in the middle 
of the 20th century through the realization that life consisted of molecular 
phenomena that transcended classical biochemistry and genetics. Genes 
are complex nano-programs of DNA that dictate all cellular activities and 
determine inheritance and evolution (hallmarks 2 and 6). Sophisticated 
nano-machineries made from proteins (and sometimes including RNA) 
replicate and express genes, convert chemical energy into mechanical and 
osmotic energy, move molecules across biological membranes, and 
regulate all cellular activities. See Figure 1.2 for a graphic description of 
these statements. 
1.3 Molecular Biology is a basic science but its methods 
have enormous applications 
Molecular Biology has raised Biology from a descriptive level into the 
category of an “exact science” because hypotheses can be tested by 
genetic modifications of organisms and the mechanisms of nucleic acids 
programs and protein nano-machineries can be understood at the atomic 
level through either X-ray Crystallography or Cryo-Electron Microscopy. 
 
Genetic Engineering is the basic tool that proves the physiological 
function of genes and proteins by generating gain-of-function and loss-of-
function mutants. Basically, modifications of isolated genes are made “in 
vitro” to generate gain-of-function (higher expression or higher protein 

What is Molecular Biology? 
 
5 
activity) or loss-of-function (knock out/null mutants or mutants with 
partial loss of function) and then these mutated genes are introduced into 
organisms by replacing the wild type copy. Phenotypes are investigated to 
ascertain what functions of the organism are modified. A final 
development has been the study of thousands of genes at the same time 
with special microarrays containing thousands of nano-samples in small 
pieces of glass. This process has been named “Genomics”, and the word 
“omics” has been generalized to massive studies with proteins 
(Proteomics). 
 
 
 
Figure 1.2. Molecular Biology is an approach to understanding life by considering 
proteins and nucleic acids as the “hardware” (nano-machineries) and “software” 
(nano-programs), respectively, of living cells. These crucial molecules are studied 
at the atomic level and modified to test hypotheses.  
 
An example is shown in Table 1.1. The physiological function during 
intracellular acid stress of the two prolyl isomerases in the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated using two kinds of transgenic 
plants: (a) single (rof1 or rof2) and double (rof1 rof2) mutants with loss-
of-function (knock out) by insertion of T-DNA (the part of the Ti plasmid 
of Agrobacterium tumefaciens transferred to plant cell genomes by 
conjugation); and (b) gain-of-function by over-expression of ROF2 (OE 
ROF2) through transformation with a chimeric gene containing the strong 
2x35S viral promoter and the coding regions of ROF2. Intracellular acid 
stress was produced by the addition of acetic acid, which diffuses into 

Chapter 1 
 
6
cells in the protonated form and dissociates protons inside. The experiment 
demonstrates that these two prolyl isomerases are redundant (single 
mutants have little phenotype but the double mutant is clearly more 
sensitive to the acid than the wild type) and required for maximum 
tolerance to intracellular acidification. On the other hand, the improved 
tolerance to intracellular acidification resulting from over-expression of 
ROF2 suggests that this prolyl isomerase gene is limiting for tolerance to 
intracellular acid stress. Over-expression of a gene corresponding to a not-
limiting step would not improve stress tolerance.

3.5 mM acetic acid. Data from the author.

These methodologies, developed to test the physiological function of 
genes, have also led to transgenic organisms (GMOs or Genetically 
Modified Organisms) with applications in agriculture (useful transgenic 
crops), animal breeding (useful transgenic animals) and medicine (useful 
transgenic microorganisms producing drugs, hormones or antibodies). One 
example of a genetically modified organism widely utilized is the insect-
resistant potato, which expresses insecticide proteins from Bacillus 
thuringiensis called Bt and is encoded by Cry genes (see Figure 1.3). 
Other examples are the fast-growing salmon (which over-expresses growth 
hormone) and the insulin-producing bacteria (which express the human 
insulin gene).  
 
An irrational rejection of transgenic crops has been developed in Europe 
by environmental (Green) parties and non-scientific populist organizations 
such as Greenpeace. This rejection has no scientific basis and it is hoped it 
will go away with time because GMOs are the future of agriculture and 
cattle raising. In America and China there is no such rejection. When the

Spanish discoverers of America brought tomatoes and potatoes from the 
new world to Europe (16th century) they were immediately eaten in Spain 
but it took two centuries for the French and Germans to eat these 
wonderful healthy foods. Non-Mediterranean Europeans are very conservative 
and easily confused by environmental activists. The European Union, for 
example, had for a period a Scientific Advisor, the English scientist Prof. 
Anne Glover, but as she made a document in favor of transgenic 
organisms she was inmediately fired. Clearly, the European Union 
operates by the non-scientific ideology of Greenpeace and has no respect 
for scientists.

Engineers, Madrid, Spain). 
 
Atomic structures require the biochemical purification of proteins from 
either cell tissues or from transgenic microorganisms or convenient 
organisms expressing the protein of interest. X-ray diffraction of crystals 
or cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) of single particles provide the 
required structures. Protein crystals provide a static array of molecules for 
X-ray diffraction, but by using single protein molecules at the liquid 
helium temperature (-269 ºC) during Cryo-EM, molecules are static and, 
as indicated above, the three-dimensional structure can be solved without 
the tedious crystallization.    
 
Atomic structures allow us to understand the mechanisms of the protein 
nano-machineries involved in chemical, mechanical, osmotic and 
regulatory works in cells. An example of a complex protein machinery is 
the mitochondrial Fo.F1-ATPase or ATP synthase of bacteria, mitochondria 

Chapter 1

and chloroplasts, which is composed of 31 protein subunits and has had its 
atomic structure solved by modern Cryo-Electron Microscopy (see Figure 
1.4). Mitochondria carry out oxidation of reduced substrates with oxygen 
and the respiratory complexes couple the chemical energy of red-ox 
reactions to pumping protons out of mitochondria. This is the 
chemiosmotic theory of Peter Mitchell, who received the Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry in 1978 and buried the previous model based on chemical 
phosphorylated intermediates as occurs in glycolysis. The electrochemical 
proton gradient (pH difference and electrical potential) drives ATP 
synthesis by forcing mitochondrial Fo.F1-ATPase to run in reverse, 
working as an ATP synthase and coupling proton uptake by mitochondria 
to ATP synthesis.  
 
The enzyme was discovered by Efraim Racker and is made of two parts: 
Fo - with the “o” coming from conferring sensitivity to the drug 
oligomycin, binding to the trans-membrane part - and F1 - factor 1 of the 
oxidative phosphorylation with ATPase activity protruding from the 
membrane. Both parts contain static subunits and rotary ones. The 
mechanism was solved by the model of Paul Boyer and the enzyme 
structure of John E. Walker and both shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
in 1997. This protein nano-machinery works as a rotary motor: ATP 
hydrolysis (ATP + H2O -> ADP + Pi + 30 kJ/mol) forces rotation of the 
rotor part with respect to the stator part (counter clock-wise from the top 
of F1), resulting in the pumping of protons out of the mitochondria. When 
the proton gradient generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain is big 
enough (> 40 kJ/mol), protons move into mitochondria though the 
ATPase, and force rotation of the rotor part clockwise from the top of F1, 
i.e. in the opposite direction to before, and the enzyme is converted into 
ATP synthase. Rotation of the rotor part modifies the three catalytic 
subunits (E) sequentially from active site open (O), to active site binding 
ADP + Pi (L), to active site binding preferentially ATP + H2O (T). 
Alternatively, ATP hydrolysis when no respiration is working results in a 
T > L> O sequence. See Figure 8.19.

In addition to providing insight into mechanisms, the atomic structures of 
crucial proteins in human diseases, such as viral proteins and oncogenic 
proteins, paved the way for rational drug design. Major examples are 
inhibitors of the essential protease of human immunodeficiency virus such 
as Crixivan (Figure 1.5 A) and inhibitors of tyrosine kinases such as 
Gleevec (imatinib mesylate), which inhibits the oncogenic Bcr-Abl fusion 
protein active in chronic myelogenous leukemia (Figure 1.6 A). Both cases 
illustrate the point that determination of the atomic structure of targets is 
essential for rational drug design. Organic molecules are then designed to 
block the active site of the protein. In the first case the inhibitor resembles 
the peptide substrate of HIV protease (Figure 1.5B). In the second case, 
Gleevec binds to the catalytic cleft of the kinase without resembling the 
substrates of the enzyme (Figure 1.6 B).

The three steps of rational drug design are: 
 
1. Identifying the protein responsible for a disease. 
2. Solving the atomic structure of this protein. 
3. Designing an organic molecule able to block the active site of the 
protein. 
 
Another methodology of Molecular Biology is Bioinformatics, which is 
the analysis of the sequences and structures of genes and proteins. This has 
become especially prevalent with the “big data” that resulted from the 
“omic” approaches (global studies of all the genes and proteins of an 
organism – called genomics and proteomics, respectively). Algorithms for 
“big data” analysis have enormous importance in health and marketing

studies. An example is the genotyping of human beings and 
microorganisms, plants and animals. The sequencing of different genomes 
from the same species has shown differences between individuals 
belonging to geographical and racial groups. This has become a very 
profitable business for an American company named “23andMe” that 
utilizes saliva samples from customers to isolate DNA and analyze SNPs 
(Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - changes of one nucleotide at a 
position of the genome in different individuals) to estimate ancestry and 
health risks. More than 600,000 oligonucleotides are printed onto small 
chips by the company Illumina (San Diego, California, USA) to be 
hybridized with the DNA samples of the organism by automated 
techniques and the resulting map is correlated with phenotypes (https:// 
www.23andme.com/?mdc2=true). 
1.4. An example of a Molecular Biology approach: growth 
control by proton transport 
Physiological and biochemical studies have shown that cell plasma 
membranes have transport systems for two monovalent cations: protons 
and sodium. Two types of transporters exist: primary active transporters 
and secondary transporters. The first couple light or chemical energy (red-
ox reactions or ATP hydrolysis) to pump H+ or Na+ out of cells, creating 
the electrochemical gradient of these cations. Secondary transporters 
couple the uptake of nutrients or the efflux of toxic molecules to the 
energy released by the downhill movements of H+ or Na+ into cells. 
Animal cells and some prokaryotes have a primary transport of sodium 
and a secondary one of protons, while fungi, plants and most prokaryotes 
have a primary transport of protons and a secondary one of sodium. In 
addition to nutrient uptake, intracellular pH and sodium concentrations 
seem to have a more specific regulatory role in cell growth (see Chapters 
8, 9 and 10). A Molecular Biology approach to this important aspect of 
Biology has the following steps: 
 
1. Isolation by biochemical methods of the plasma membrane H+-
ATPase (Pma1) from the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
(baker’s yeast) and demonstration in vitro (upon reconstitution in 
lipid membranes) that the enzyme couples ATP hydrolysis to pump 
protons into vesicles. See Table 10.1. 
2. Isolation by Genetic Engineering methods of the PMA1 gene 
encoding the yeast proton pump. 

What is Molecular Biology? 
 
13 
3. Generation by reverse genetics of mutant yeast cells with different 
levels of proton pump activity. 
4. Correlation between growth rate and Pma1 activity in the above 
series of mutants (Table 1.2). 
5. Expression in mouse fibroblasts of the yeast PMA1 gene, resulting 
in fast growth and tumorigenic transformation (Table 1.3). 
6. The conclusion is that proton transport regulates growth not only in 
yeast, where H+ transport is primary, but also in mouse fibroblasts, 
where H+ transport is secondary to Na+ transport. Cancer is a 
disease of unregulated growth control where proton efflux and 
intracellular pH are greater than normal and the above results open 
novel therapeutic strategies centered on proton transport.

1.5. Hallmarks of Molecular Biology 
Molecular Biology can be differentiated from Biochemistry and from 
Genetics, the two most related disciplines. We may list the most important 
distinguishing features (hallmarks) as the conclusion of this chapter: 
 
(1) The basic concept of Molecular Biology is that biological phenomena 
can be understood through knowledge of the genes involved (software) 
and their encoded proteins (hardware), the two central molecules of life. 
This generalization reflects the molecular unity underlying the biological 
diversity of living organisms (Chapter 1). 
 
(2) In addition to the classical tools of Biochemistry and Genetics, the 
specific tools of Molecular Biology are Genetic Engineering (gene 
manipulation), physical methods (X-ray crystallography and Cryo-
Electron Microscopy) applied to the atomic structure of genes and proteins 
and, finally, Bioinformatics (to manipulate normal and “Big” data). These 
tools have generated novel applications in Medicine and Agriculture 
(Chapters 1-4). 
 
(3) The function of genes and encoded proteins can be demonstrated by 
genetic modification. The mechanisms of protein machineries can be 
investigated at the atomic level through structural studies (Chapters 3 and 
4). 
 
(4) The genomic revolution is transforming Molecular Biology and its 
applications. Biological phenomena are tackled by studying thousands of 
genes at the same time (Chapters 2 and 3). 
 
(5) Gene expression and protein synthesis are precise and regulated by  
complex machineries of many protein subunits and RNAs, explaining 
inheritance and the production of the proteins encoded by genes (Chapter 
8). 
 
(6) Protein nano-machineries execute chemical, mechanical, osmotic and  
regulatory works in cells (Chapters 5-6 and 8-9), explaining all the 
mysteries of life.

1.6. The chemical bonds important in Molecular Biology 
The secondary (three-dimensional) structure of nucleic acids and proteins 
is based on two kinds of bonds: hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects. 
The first are formed by sharing hydrogen atoms between nitrogen and 
oxygen atoms (Scheme 1.1).  
 
Hydrogen-                Hydrogen- 
bond donor               bond acceptor  
-        +  
               - 
 
N---- H ---------------------- N  
N---- H ---------------------- O 
O-----H ---------------------- N 
O-----H ---------------------  O 
 
Scheme 1.1. The four types of hydrogen bonds in biomolecules. 
 
Electronegativity is the relative strength of atoms to attract shared 
electrons in a covalent bond. The values for the most important biological 
atoms in organic molecules are: hydrogen 2.1, carbon 2.5, nitrogen 3.0, 
oxygen 3.5, phosphorus 2.1, sulfide 2.5, and chlorine 3.0. When the 
difference in the electronegativity of two bound atoms is close to 1 or 
greater the bond is polarized and therefore the covalent bonds H-O and H-N 
are polarized and the H is shared between two more electronegative atoms, 
N and O, in a linear form. Hydrogen bonds are broken by high 
concentrations of formamide or urea by competition, and by strong acids or 
bases by dissociation of the donor of H or the protonation of the H acceptor.  
 
Linus C. Pauling (1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1962 Nobel Peace 
Prize) (see Figure 1.6), together with Robert B. Corey, was the first to 
recognize that hydrogen bonds stabilize protein, D helices and Esheets, as 
well as DNA structures (Pauling, 2014).

Chapter 1 
 
16
During the formation of base pairs in nucleic acids by hydrogen bonds, 
water molecules (that were forming H-bonds with the nitrogen bases) are 
released. This exchange is favored because H2O-H2O bonds are less stable 
than base-base bonds due to the motility of free water molecules (bases in 
double strand nucleic acids are immobilized). 
 
The hydrophobic effect is based on the fact that hydrophobic surfaces in 
contact with water are surrounded by cages of partially immobilized water 
molecules. When the hydrophobic surfaces bind to each other these water 
molecules are released and entropy increases (see Figure 1.7). This was 
first described by Charles Tanford (1980). 
 
This effect is broken by strong ionic detergents such as sodium dodecyl 
sulphate (SDS) that bind to hydrophobic surfaces, and by chaotropic salts 
(Figure 1.8) with big ions such as guanidine and thiocyanate that destroy 
the partial structure of liquid water and then there is no gain of entropy 
when a few water molecules are released by joining hydrophobic surfaces. 
Finally, it is broken by organic solvents (chloroform and phenol) that bind 
to hydrophobic surfaces preventing their interaction. 
 
                                   
 
 
 
Figure 1.7. The basis of the hydrophobic effect. 
 
Proteins are denatured by the disruption of hydrophobic effects while 
nucleic acids are not affected by these treatments. Disruption of H-bonds 
and high temperatures denature both types of macromolecules.

GENES AND GENOMES 
 
 
 
2.1. The discovery of the double helix of DNA 
The discovery of the double helix of DNA was an important milestone for 
Molecular Biology, but it also illustrated the sometimes-tortuous pathways 
of scientific research. The protagonists of this story appear in Figure 2.1.

In 1953 Watson and Crick published a crucial article on the structure of 
DNA (Watson and Crick 1953, page 737), presenting the first picture of 
the double helix (Figure 2.2). This article explained the mechanism of 
copying of the genetic material by base pairing and they, together with 
Maurice Wilkins, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 
1962. Rosalind Franklin, working in Maurice Wilkins’s laboratory, had 
obtained by X-ray crystallography the first picture of DNA, revealing the 
helical shape of the molecule. The double helix is composed of two linear 
strands that run opposite to each other and twist together. Another 
important part of this discovery was the rule discovered by Erwin Chargaff 
that in DNA there is always equality between the bases A (adenine) and T 
(thymine) and between the bases G (guanine) and C (cytosine). DNA had

been discovered as a chemical by the Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher in 
1860 (Watson and Crick 1953, page 737).

DNA through the major groove. Courtesy of biologyexams4u.com. 
 
It is difficult to understand why Watson and Crick did not include Franklin 
and Wilkins in their Nature paper, considering that the x-ray data belonged 
to them. Franklin died from cancer soon after and Wilkins was included in 
the Nobel Prize. 
 
The discovery of DNA as the hereditary material was made by Frederick 
Griffith in 1928 and Oswald Avery in 1933 working with Streptococcus 
pneumoniae. Two different forms of the bacteria, named R (rough) and S 
(smooth) for the appearance of their surfaces, could spontaneously convert 
into the other. Mice unexpectedly died after Griffith injected them with a 
mixture of live Type I R (not pathogenic) and heat-killed Type II S 
pneumococci (pathogenic), while neither killed the mice when injected 
alone. The transforming principle was found to be DNA (O’Connor 2008, 
page 104). 
2.2. Scarcity of genes is solved by Genetic Engineering or 
Recombinant DNA technology: cloning in vivo and in vitro 
Genes exist in one or two copies per cell within a big genome and this 
makes their isolation by biochemical methods (cell disruption and 
purification of desired molecules) impossible. The solution is cloning - the 
production of many copies of a given gene. This is done by propagation in

the model bacterium Escherichia coli and requires the cutting of genes 
away from the long chromosomes and pasting them into plasmids. These 
are circular molecules of DNA that replicate inside the bacterium and 
make any desired amount of the attached gene during growth at different 
scales. They contain the gene coding for enzymes that destroy antibiotics, 
which enables the selection of bacteria containing them (Sambrook and 
Russell, 2001, pages 1.31-1.162, and Primrose, Sandy and Twyman, 2006, 
pages 43-60). 
 
DNA is cut by type II restriction endonucleases, enzymes that cut DNA at 
specific sites making ends compatible with other DNA molecules cut with 
the same enzyme or making blunt ends that are always compatible (Figure 
2.1): 
 
                
 
 
 
Figure 2.1. Sequence of the site recognized by endonuclease EcoR V (A) and 
structural view with the two halves recognized by the dimeric enzyme (B). B is a 
courtesy of the Protein Data Bank. 
 
The sites recognized by most enzymes are palindromic (see Figure 2.1 A) 
because the enzyme is formed by two identical subunits that bind the two 
halves of the DNA site from different sides to avoid mutual interference 
(see Figure 2.1 B). The binding of the restriction enzyme to its specific site 
is based on hydrogen bonds between the side chain of amino acids or the 
main chain of the protein (peptide bonds) with the nitrogen bases. 
Restriction endonucleases were discovered by Werner Arber, Daniel 
Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith, who received the Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine in 1978 (see Figure 2.2). 
 
Cloning in E. coli (in vivo) is done by cutting with restriction endonucleases 
and pasting into cut plasmids with DNA ligases. The resulting plasmids 
are called recombinant plasmids because they include DNA molecules 
from different sources. These enzymes utilize the energy of ATP to make 
covalent bonds (phospho-ester) (see Chapter 5).

The first recombinant plasmid was constructed by Stanley Cohen and 
Herbert Boyer (see Figure 2.3) in 1972. Using restriction endonucleases 
they cut a piece of DNA from a plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium that 
carried a gene for antibiotic resistance and pasted this fragment into a 
plasmid of Escherichia coli.  
 
Paul Berg (see Figure 2.4) succeeded in joining DNA from bacteria to the 
DNA of the SV40 virus in 1972 and received the 1980 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry. 
                     
 
An alternative method to constructing plasmids is the Gateway (commercial 
name) system, discovered by James L. Hartley and co-workers in 2013 
(Hartley, Temple and Brasch 2000, page 1788) and commercialized by 
ThermoFisherScientific:  
(https://www.thermofisher.com/es/es/home/lifescience/cloning/gateway). 

Chapter 2 
 
22
Thanks to commercial enzymes of the recombination system of Ophage, a 
DNA fragment of the plasmid is exchanged for the gene to be inserted. 
Both the plasmid and the desired insert need to have specific flanking sites 
recognized by the recombination machinery. The DNA released from the 
plasmid during recombination contains a toxic gene for the E. coli host, 
which makes cloning very efficient because the non-recombinant plasmids 
from the ligation reaction cannot produce bacterial colonies after 
transformation of competent cells. In the traditional cut and paste system 
the digested plasmid very often ligates with itself without including the 
foreign DNA. 
 
Cloning in vitro is made by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), but in 
this case you need to know the sequence of the DNA to be cloned. This is 
so because DNA polymerase requires primers, small oligonucleotides that 
hybridize with the two strands of the DNA to be cloned and in order to 
make them we need to know their sequence. 
2.3. Reverse transcriptase makes RNA accessible 
 to Genetic Engineering 
The enzymes utilized for gene cloning work only with double stranded 
DNA and have no activity with RNA. Therefore, in order to study RNA, it 
has to be converted into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This 
enzyme only exists in animal retroviruses and was discovered by Howard 
M. Temin, Renato Dulbecco and David Baltimore, who shared the 1975 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Figure 2.5). I heard a lecture of 
David Baltimore at the Whitehead Institute (MIT, Boston, USA) and he 
said that he forgot to patent reverse transcriptase. At that time, scientists 
were not so interested in money. Now it is different. 
 
Retroviruses have a single strand RNA genome that once inside the animal 
cell is converted into double strand DNA that integrates into the cell 
genome. Once there it is transcribed as single strand RNA to be packed 
into viral particles. The polyprotein produced is cut into individual 
proteins by an essential protease of the virus (see Figure 2.6).

transcriptase (5), integrated into the cell genome (6), transcribed into RNA and 
viral proteins (7), assembled as viral particles (8) and extruded from cells (9).

2.4. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
PCR was invented by Kary B. Mullis in 1983 (see Figure 2.7 left). He was 
working for a small biotechnological company, Cetus, and during a 
vacation with his wife he could not stop thinking about how to replicate 
DNA in vitro. Arthur Kornberg, the discoverer of DNA polymerase, 
shared the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine with Severo 
Ochoa for the discovery of the mechanisms used in the biological 

Chapter 2 
 
24
synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. Kornberg had 
developed “primer extension”, where you extend a strand of DNA with a 
primer, but he tried to extend the two strands with two primers without 
success. Mullis realized that what happened in Kornberg’s experiments 
was the re-hybridization of the two template strands. The solution Mullis 
found was to dilute the reaction mixture in such a way that the primers 
competed favorably with the templates. This was successful, and he 
received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but his wife divorced him 
because she felt ignored during that vacation. 
 
Kornberg was called by the large chemicals company DuPont to help 
question the Mullis-Cetus patent in the tribunals. In the trial, Mullis’s 
lawyer asked Kornberg to show in which part of his book on DNA 
polymerase did the polymerase chain reactions appear. Kornberg could not 
show it and accordingly the trial was lost (Mullis, 1994, page 427).  
 
PCR is now a basic tool for many important techniques, such as the 
detection of viral infections, paternity tests and criminal investigations. It 
also allows for the fast isolation of genes with known sequences.

discoverer of DNA and protein sequencing (right). Courtesy of The Washington 
Post (KM) and es.wikipedia.org (FS). 
2.5. DNA sequencing: Sanger method and Next 
Generation Sequencing (NGS)  
The first method for sequencing DNA was developed by Frederick Sanger 
(see Figure 2.7 right), who shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980. The Sanger method is called the 
dideoxy method because it uses 2´, 3´ dideoxy analogues of nucleotides 
(see Figure 2.8). These nucleotides, when incorporated into a growing 
strand of DNA, inhibit the further incorporation of nucleotides because 

Genes and Genomes 
25 
they lack the hydroxyl group at position 3´. The functioning of the method 
is described in Figure 2.9. A convenient primer starts replication of a 
single-stranded DNA by DNA polymerase I. The reaction mixture 
contains an excess of the four unlabeled deoxynucleotides and small 
amounts of the dideoxy ones with four different fluorescent labels. When 
one dideoxy is incorporated strand elongation ends and the fluorescent 
label indicates the complementary nucleotide in the sequenced strand at a 
given position. Ordering finished strands by size and looking at their 
fluorescence results in the sequence of the starting single strand. Up to one 
thousand nucleotides can be read from every reaction. Sanger had 
previously received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery 
of a method for sequencing amino acids in proteins. 
 
Once the sequence of the genome of an individual within one species has 
been established, it is possible to do very fast and cheap sequencing of 
other individuals by the so-called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). 
There are three major NGS methods with instruments developed by 
different companies (Figure 2.10). After each deoxynucleotide incorporation 
pyrophosphate (PPi) and protons (H+) are liberated and detected with 
specific systems. The template strands are bound in nano drops or nano-
resins in Roche (454) and Ion Torrent instruments. Illumina and Solexa 
have developed “reversible terminator sequencing”, adapting the Sanger 
method to NGS. In these novel technologies only small pieces of sequences 
(up to a hundred nucleotides) are obtained for millions of readings. Using 
the complete sequence of one individual obtained by the standard Sanger 
method, you can assemble the whole genome of other individuals.

More recently, Nanopore sequencing has been developed by the Oxford 
Nanopore MinION company (Jain, Hugh, Benedict and Akeson 2000, 
page 239). In this method, chains of single strand DNA or RNA pass 
through a channel made by the protein alpha-hemolysin inserted in a 
membrane surface. This movement is driven by an electrical potential and 
every nucleotide of the sequence produces a different signal of ion current 
(see Figure 2.11). It is the most promising method for the future.

The Sanger method has been used for de novo sequencing of genomes and 
Sanger himself obtained in 1977 the first complete sequence of a genome, 
that of the FX174 DNA virus. Other genomes sequenced in the following 
years are indicated in Table 2.1.

Some plants are among the organisms with the greatest genomes, for 
example wheat has 17 000 Mb and 200,000 estimated genes.  
 
Clearly, the size of genomes and the number of genes does not correlate 
with the evolutionary level of an organism. 
2.7. Genetic modification of organisms 
The final goal of Genetic Engineering is genetic modification to test 
hypotheses about the function of genes and proteins. In addition, genetic 
modifications have biotechnological applications. 
 
Genetic modification of animals and plants is complicated because you 
have to use isolated cells and then obtain an organism. In mammals this is 
made by the microinjection of DNA into the male pronucleus of fertilized 
eggs (Figure 2.12).

pipette to support the fertilized egg of a mouse and on the right, the micropipette 
with the solution of DNA.  Courtesy of en.wikipedia.org. 
 
Genes can be disrupted by homologous recombination, where a gene with 
a null-mutation and connected to a selection marker replaces the wild type 
gene (see Figure 2.13). This method is highly efficient in bacteria and 
yeast and still possible in the cells of mice. 
 
Genetic modification of bacteria and yeast is relatively simple: genes are 
supplemented after cloning into plasmids behind bacterial promoters. 
Bacteria and yeast cells are made competent for plasmid uptake by 

Genes and Genomes 
29 
electroporation or chemical treatments with calcium and manganese 
(bacteria) or lithium (yeast). These treatments permeabilize the cell wall 
and enable the plasma membrane to allow DNA uptake (Primrose and 
Twyman, 2006, page 26).  
 
 
 
Figure 2.13. Gene disruption by homologous recombination. 
 
Genetic modification of plants is made with the soil bacterium 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes tumors in plants (Figure 2.14).

Chapter 2

This bacterium contains a plasmid called Ti (for Tumor inducing) that 
contains a region known as T-DNA (for Transferred DNA) which is 
transferred to the plant genome by a process of conjugation between 
bacteria and plant cells (see Figure 2.15). This region contains genes for 
the synthesis of plant growth hormones and for the synthesis of amino acid 
derivatives known as octopines and agropines. These metabolites can only 
be utilized by Agrobacterium tumefaciens because the Ti plasmid contains 
genes for the metabolism of octopines and agropines. Genetic transformation 
of plants is made with modified Ti plasmids where in the T-DNA region 
the genes produced by plant growth hormones and octopines or agropines 
synthesis have been replaced by genes of interest, with constitutive high 
expression promoters (such as the 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic 
virus) or inducible promoters regulated by ethanol or by the steroid 
hormones of mammals. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.15. The Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 
 
A method that can transform all kinds of cells is electroporation, which 
consists in submitting cell suspensions to short pulses of high electric 
fields (200-2000 volts). This creates transient pores both in cell walls and 
cell membranes. 
 
Genomic modification has been revolutionized by two novel technologies: 
RNA silencing or interference and CRISPR-Cas9. In both cases nucleases 
guided by small RNAs can specifically degrade mRNAs (RNA silencing 
or RNAi, see Figure 2.16) or specifically modify genes (CRISPR-Cas9, 
see Figure 2.18). In the first, case double strand RNA (the mRNA to be 
destroyed and the complementary RNA expressed from an inverted coding 
region) is cut into small fragments by the ribonuclease Dicer and then 

Genes and Genomes 
31 
another ribonuclease, RISC, takes the non-coding strand as a guide to bind 
and destroy the target mRNAs. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.16. The mechanism of RNA silencing. 
 
The CRISPR-Cas9 system was discovered by the Spanish scientist 
Francisco Martinez Mojica (see Figure 2.17) (Mojica, Ferrer, Juez and 
Rodriguez-Valera, 1995, page 85), from the University of Alicante, Spain, 
as a bacterial system to destroy viruses that had previously infected the 
bacteria. Fragments of viral genomes were found in the bacterial genome 
to produce RNAs that directed the Cas9 endonuclease to destroy the 
integrity of any virus genome that were trying to infect the bacterium. The 
French scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier and the American scientist 
Jennifer Doudna (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014, page 1258096-1) 
adapted the system to the editing of genomes in general and received the 
2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Clearly, Mojica should have shared in this 
Nobel Prize. In the case of restriction enzymes, the 1978 Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Werner Arber, Daniel 
Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith "for the discovery of restriction enzymes 
and their application to problems of molecular genetics". The case of F. 
Martinez Mojica indicates an intolerable discrimination against Spanish 
scientists, paying attention only to the scientists who developed 
applications, but not to the one who discovered the most important thing: 
the phenomenon.

system who was ignored by the Nobel Foundation in a demonstration of 
discrimination against the south of Europe. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.18. The mechanism of the CRISPR-Cas9 editing of genomes. 
 
As indicated in Figure 2.18, Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease 
(A). The guide RNA bound to the enzyme directs it to the desired region 
of the genome where it makes a double strand cut (B). Then the 
endogenous DNA repair machinery mediates non-homologous end 
joining, which results in random mutations (insertions and deletions, 
called indels) at the break point (NHEJ). Another possibility is to supply to 

Genes and Genomes 
33 
the guide RNA and Cas9 endonuclease a fragment of DNA with homologous 
sequences at both sides of the cut region. The homologous recombination 
systems are activated by the DNA cut, and are then repaired by introducing 
the desired DNA fragment (HDR) (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014, page 
1258096-1).  
 
An important aspect in both RNA silencing and CRISPR-Cas9 is the size 
of the guide RNA. In order to target a single site in transcriptomes (all 
mRNAs) and in genomes 20 bp are needed because: 
 
1/420 = 1/1.1 x 1012 § 1 site/ 106 Mb. 
 
One of the biggest genomes, that of wheat, has 17,000 Mb and therefore 
an RNA guide of 20 nucleotides can only target one site in this genome.

PROTEIN STRUCTURE 
 
 
 
3.1. The four levels of protein structure 
The primary structure of proteins is their amino acid sequence. The 
secondary structure is composed of Dhelices, E sheets, loops and turns. 
The tertiary structure is the folding of the latter in a native protein 
monomer and the quaternary structure is the binding together of several 
monomers (Figure 3.1). Not all proteins have a quaternary structure. The 
formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar carbonyl and the amino 
groups of the main chain determines that these secondary structures can be 
buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein. Sequences are always N-
term to C-term.

The first protein structure determined by the X-ray diffraction of crystals 
was obtained by Max Perutz and John Kendrew (see Figure 3.2) in 1950 
using whale myoglobin crystals and received the 1962 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry.  

Chapter 3

Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) was discovered by Jacques Dubochet, 
Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson, who received the 2017 Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry (see Figure 3.3).   
3.2. Visualizing protein structure 
As indicated in Figure 3.4, the visualization of protein structure is made by 
either space filling models (the real structure) or by simplified ribbon 
diagrams for alpha helices (as coils), beta sheets (as flat arrows) and loops 
and turns (as lines). The real structure is not useful for appreciating special 
features of the protein; they can be better pinpointed in the ribbon diagrams. 
 
Protein structures are more complex than DNA structures. Only a few 
general rules are known and structures cannot be fully predicted from the 
amino acid sequence.  
 
Peptide bonds are flat because of resonance that confers a double bond 
character (Figure 3.5).

Accordingly, peptide bonds are rigid but all the other bonds within 
proteins can rotate and the possibilities of folding are enormous.  
 
Peptide bonds exist in trans conformation because of the steric hindrance 
of amino acid side chains in the cis conformation (see Figure 3.6, upper 
panels). An exception are the X-proline bonds because in these cases trans 
conformation is not more stable than cis conformation (see Figure 3.6, 
lower panels) and during protein folding the exchange between the cis and 
trans is catalyzed by chaperones called prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The 
proline-X bonds are normal and exist only in trans conformation.

bonds. Courtesy of Projects at Harvard, Chapter 5. 
3.3. Flexibility for conformational changes but fragility 
and denaturation 
The secret of the functionality of proteins as cellular machineries is their 
flexibility to experience conformational changes after binding other 
molecules or experiencing chemical modifications. Exceptions are proteins 
with structural roles and those serving as reserves of amino acids. 
 
This functional feature of flexible proteins comes at a price: these proteins 
are labile and denature (lose their native structure) very easily. This 
generates the need for protecting, refolding and degradation systems, as 
described in the following sections.  
3.4. Alpha-helices 
The secondary structure of proteins is made of D-helices, E-sheets and 
reverse turns. D-helices are shown in Figure 3.7.

diagram on the right. Courtesy of dreamtime.com (left) and en.wikipedia.org 
(right). 
 
The alpha helix is a coiled structure stabilized by intrachain hydrogen 
bonds. It is right-handed with a length of 1.5 nm per 10 amino acids. Its 
width is 1.2 nm and there are 3.6 residues per turn. The carbonyl backbone 
group of residue “n” form a hydrogen bond with the NH group of “n + 4” 
residue.  
 
Fibrous proteins made of helices, like keratin and leucine zippers, provide 
structural support for the cells and tissues of animals (Figure 3.8). They 
have 3.5 residues/turn instead of 3.6 in isolated helices. They can have lengths 
of 100 nm with a resistance similar to stainless steel. In leucine zippers, every 
seven residues should be a leucine to make hydrophobic interactions.

3.5. Beta-sheets 
E-Sheets can be parallel or antiparallel (Figure 3.9) and have a length of 35 
nm per 10 amino acids. They have a twisted shape. Beta-sheets may form 
beta-sheet barrels (Figure 3.10).

Reverse or hairpin turns result in a change of direction of polypeptide 
chains (Figure 3.11).

3.7. Disulfide bridges 
Disulfide bridges between two proteins (like coiled coils) or between two 
parts of one protein can be broken by reduction with a thiol reagent and 
reformed by oxidants (Figure 3.12). 
 
 
 
Figure 3.12. Reversible oxidation and reduction of disulfide groups in proteins. 
 
These changes are applied to introduce curls of hair in hairdressing salons. 
First, disulfide bonds in the hair are broken up by adding a thiol-
containing reagent and gentle heating. Then the hair is curled as desired. 
Finally, an oxidizing agent is added to re-form the disulfide bonds, 
stabilizing the desired shape.

3.8. Collagen triple strand helix 
The amino acid sequence of the collagen monomer is special because 
glycine is present at every third position. There are also many prolines and 
hydroxyprolines. Collagen forms a triple helix (Figure 3.13) and it is 
essential that the glycine is positioned to fit in the center of the triple helix. 
The pyrrolidine ring of prolines is on the outside to be hydroxylated.

One example of a protein with quaternary structure is hemoglobin (see 
Figure 3.14), which has two alpha subunits (red and blue) and two beta 
subunits (green and purple).

As indicated in Figure 3.15, proteins contain several modifications of the 
side chains of the amino acids.

3.11. Prion diseases affect protein structure 
Special types of neurological diseases, including Alzheimers, Parkinsons 
and mad cow disease, are caused by a kind of molecular contagion. 
Insoluble aggregates are formed by beta-sheet structures interlocked as a 
double helix (see Figure 3.16) and called “Prions”. Prions are incorrectly 
folded proteins that form insoluble aggregates with beta sheet structures. 
When Prions contact correctly folded proteins a contagion occurs and 
these correct proteins form insoluble aggregates with beta-sheet structures.

3.12. Chaperones or HSPs 
Chaperones were discovered through two different approaches:  
 
1) Some Escherichia coli mutants failed to support replication of 
Ophage. Mutated chaperones were defective in the massive 
assembly of viral proteins required for phage reproduction. 
2) During heat-shock stress chaperones were massively induced to 
refold denatured proteins. 
 
Chaperones or Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are specialized proteins that 
protect other proteins against denaturation or help them to refold. They 
have two nomenclatures because of the two approaches that lead to their 
discovery: one as HSPs and another from the Escherichia coli mutants. 
The five kinds of chaperones are: 
 
(a) HSP100 – these have molecular weights between 97 and 114 kilo 
Daltons and are oligomers that form a hexamer ring. They mediate 
ATP-dependent disaggregation of denatured aggregated proteins. In 
Escherichia coli they are called ClpA and ClpB. In eukaryotic cells 
they are located in the cytoplasm. 
(b) HSP90 – these have molecular weights between 80 and 94 kilo 
Daltons and are dimers. They mediate the ATP-dependent stabilization 
of client proteins. In Escherichia coli they are called HtpG and in 
eukaryotic cells are located in the cytoplasm. 

Protein Structure 
45 
(c) HSP70 – these have molecular weights between 69 and 71 kilo 
Daltons. They mediate ATP-dependent folding of denatured 
proteins and have one accessory subunit. In eukaryotic cells they 
are called HSP70 and HSP40 and localize both to the cytoplasm 
and the mitochondria. In Escherichia coli the two subunits are 
called DnaJ and GrpE. 
(d) HSP60 (also called chaperonins) – these have molecular weights 
between 57 and 60 kilo Daltons and form double heptameric rings. 
They mediate ATP-dependent folding of denatured proteins. In 
Escherichia coli they are called GroEL and GroES. In eukaryotic 
cells the accessory subunit is called HSP10. 
(e) Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) – these have molecular weights 
between 15 and 30 kilo Daltons and form complexes of 200-800 
kilo Daltons. They bind denatured proteins to prevent their 
aggregation and do not require ATP.  
 
The HSP70 mechanism is shown in Figure 3.17. The chaperone binds to 
the hydrophobic residues of denatured proteins to prevent aggregation and 
upon binding ATP releases the denatured protein in the vicinity of the 
chaperone to give it a chance to refold without risk of aggregation. When 
ATP is hydrolyzed a new cycle starts. They mediate ATP-dependent 
folding. 
 
Chaperonins or HSP60 utilize an even safer mechanism for refolding 
denatured proteins: an isolated box. In Figure 3.18, the chaperone has two 
identical chambers bound together with affinity for denatured proteins. 
Once inside, a subunit of the complex (acting as a lid) closes the chamber 
after ATP binding and therefore refolding can be made without any danger 
of aggregation. Hydrolysis of ATP completes the cycle by opening the 
cap. Chaperonins act after protein synthesis has been completed and assist 
about 10% of all proteins.

3.8. LEA proteins and osmolytes 
LEA proteins (Late Embryogenesis Abundant) owe their name to the fact 
that they were discovered as proteins accumulated in seeds during the 
latter stage of seed development anticipating desiccation, but they are also 

Protein Structure 
47 
present in vegetative tissues of plants and in other living systems during 
drought stress. They are small hydrophilic proteins with high glycine 
content (> 6%) that are intrinsically unstructured, have low sequence 
complexity based on repeated motifs, and accumulate during water stress. 
They effectively protect proteins and cellular membranes during drought 
stress because of the preservation of hydration layers. During stress, LEA 
proteins become structured (Hoekstra, Golovina and Buitink 2001, page 431). 
 
Osmolytes or compatible solutes are metabolites without aldehyde or 
amino groups that could damage proteins by chemical reactions. Examples 
are betaine, glycerol, sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol and raffinose (see Figure 
3.19). They accumulate in many organisms during water stress to protect 
proteins and membranes with the same mechanism as LEA proteins. They 
also confer protection against reactive oxygen species. 
 
As indicated in Figure 3.20, osmolytes protect the hydration layer of 
proteins. In the case of membranes, desiccation results in rigidity of the 
fatty acid chains of phospholipids (see Figure 3.21). This increases the 
passive permeability of membranes because the rigid phospholipids can’t 
cover the whole surface covered by flexible phospholipids. Osmolytes 
protect the hydration layer of membranes and avoid this problem.

hydration layer of proteins to stabilize them during desiccation.

3.9. The proteasome 
Most proteins are in continuous turnover due to several reasons: 
irreversible denaturation, chemical damage (oxidation, radiation-induced 
cuts and chemical modification) and the need to stop regulatory proteins 
when they are not useful. The resulting supply of amino acids is important 
in cells. The two steps of protein degradation are: 
 
a) Tagging of the selected protein by ubiquitination, consisting in the 
formation of isopeptide bonds of a small (76 amino acids) 
conserved protein known as ubiquitin (Ub, see Figure 3.22), whose 
carboxyl terminus reacts with the amino groups at the side chains 
of lysins. These isopeptide bonds are generated by ubiquitin 
ligases, which are very important cell regulators. 
b) Degradation by the proteasome, a protein complex of 15 nm (a 
little less than the ribosomes). The ubiquitinated proteins are 
recognized by the two regulatory subunits flanking a central 
catalytic core that contains the proteases. The regulatory parts 
utilize ATP to pump ubiquitinated proteins inside the catalytic part. 

Protein Structure 
49 
The regulatory subunits (see Figure 3.23) hydrolyze and release the 
ubiquitin for reutilization at the cytoplasm. 
 
The 26S proteasome is a big structure of 45 nm (ribosomes are 20-30 nm) 
with about 50 protein subunits. It contains a central catalytic core (20S, a 
barrel of 15 x 11.5 nm) and two accessory subunits at the ends (19S) (see 
Figure 3.23). The 19S subunits contain an Ub-protein isopeptidase to 
release the Ub for reutilization. It also contains the machinery for ATP-
dependent unfolding of the substrate protein and for pumping it into the 
catalytic barrel.

Inhibitors of the proteasome inhibit protein turnover and this is toxic for 
growing cells because of amino acid depletion (Kisselev 2021, page 54). 
The mechanism of inhibition of cell growth by high concentrations (mM 
range) of polyamines such as spermidine and norspermidine is based on 

Chapter 3

inhibition of protein ubiquitylation and the consequent amino acid 
depletion (Sayas, Pérez-Benavente, Manzano, Farrás, et al. 2019, page 
209).

BIOINFORMATICS AND EVOLUTION 
 
 
 
4.1. Sequence alignment  
The close kinship between humans and chimpanzees is demonstrated by 
the fact that the amino acid sequences of myoglobin (153 residues) of 
these two species only differ in one amino acid.  
 
In the comparison of sequences, proteins have an advantage over nucleic 
acids because one amino acid is encoded by the sequence of 3 nucleotides. 
As indicated in Scheme 4.1, bioinformatics uses the one-letter symbols for

between the two sequences in the different alignments. Two alignments 
with a number of matches are shown.

red. (B) Two alignments with 5 and 2 matches. The graph plots the matches as a 
function of alignment. There is one alignment with more matches than the rest.  
 
During the alignment of the two protein sequences, the introduction of 
gaps in one sequence may increase the number of identities. However, the 
introduction of gaps may generate artificial similarities. Score systems 
giving positive points to identities and negative points for gaps have been 
introduced, for example +10 for identities and -20 for gaps. With these 
criteria the two peptides below are about 23% identical with a score of 
+10.

The statistical significance of the alignments is determined by random 
rearrangement of the sequence of one of the two proteins being compared 
(this is called “shuffling”): 
 
 
Original sequence:  
I S S T C A H P 
 
After one shuffling:           A T I S P H S C 
 
All the resulting sequences are aligned with the other protein and the 
scores are represented in a figure like that in Figure 4.2. The best 
alignment should be much better than the ones of the shuffled sequences.

the best alignments. 
4.2. Comparison of protein structures 
Nature has selected protein sequences that result in stable folding and 
therefore there are proteins that have similar structures despite differences 
in their functions. This suggests a common ancestor. One example is 
shown with the three proteins of Figure 4.3. Bovine ribonuclease A and 
human ribonuclease A have the same function: hydrolysis of RNA. 
However, although angiogenin has a very similar structure, its function is 
completely different because it has very little ribonuclease activity and is 
instead a potent stimulator of angiogenesis.

diagram of bovine ribonuclease A (courtesy of wikiband.com), which is a digestive 
enzyme, in the center, human ribonuclease A (courtesy of en.wikipedia.org), also a 
digestive enzyme, and on the right, angiogenin (courtesy of digital.CSIC.es), a 
potent stimulator of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) with almost no activity as a 
ribonuclease.  

Chapter 4

4.3. The concept of homology 
Two proteins are homologs if derived from a common ancestor. It makes 
no sense to speak of percentages of homology because two proteins are 
either homologous or they are not. We should only speak of percentages of 
similarity. Orthologs are homologs that are present in different species and 
have the same function, such as bovine and human ribonuclease. Paralogs 
are homologs with different functions in different species or in the same 
species: in the latter case, they are also called isoforms (see Figure 4.4). 
 
 
           
Figure 4.4. The concept of homology: orthologs and paralogs. Structures 
from Figure 4.3.  
4.4. Evolutionary trees 
In evolutionary trees the distance between two proteins through 
connecting lines is proportional to the differences in sequence between 
them (see Figure 4.5).  
 
Figure 4.5. Evolutionary tree of globins. Branching was deduced from the 
comparison of amino acid sequences while the time scale on the left in millions of 
years is the result of fossil studies. 

Bioinformatics and Evolution 
55 
There is evidence that horizontal gene transfer occurred during evolution. 
This is the transfer of genes from one species to another. For example, the 
unicellular red alga Galdieria sulphuraria contains two genes of arsenate 
transporters with more similarity of sequence to bacterial genes of these 
transporters than to eukaryotic algae. Clearly, small fragments of DNA 
from dead bacteria have been incorporated in the course of evolution into 
the genome of one eukaryotic alga (Daubin and Szöllösi, 2016, page 
a018036). 
4.5. Substitution matrixes  
In order to detect distant evolutionary relationships between proteins a 
more sensitive system than that which uses identities of amino acids in a 
given position has been introduced. This system takes into account the 
similarity of amino acids. Conservative substitutions occur when in one 
position of the alignment one amino acid of one of the proteins has been 
replaced by a similar one in the other protein. In non-conservative 
substitutions one amino acid in one protein has been replaced by a 
chemically different one in the other protein. It is also important that the 
substitutions of one amino acid by another occur by the fewest number of 
nucleotide substitutions. 
 
The programs for protein sequence comparisons utilize substitution 
matrices such as Blosum62 (see Figure 4.6) to identify homologies that are 
not shown by considering only sequence identities in the alignment. This 
is the default matrix for BLASTP (see next section). It was developed by 
analyzing the frequencies of amino acid substitutions in clusters of related 
proteins. Within each cluster the amino acid sequences were at least 62% 
identical when two proteins were aligned. See the following web page:

at+is+BLASTP. 

Chapter 4 
 
56
 
 
Figure 4.6. The Blosum-62 substitution matrix. The score of a substitution of one 
amino acid (above) by amino acids in the table is at the left. 
4.5. The “BLAST” program 
BLAST is the “Basic Local Alignment Search Tool” of the National 
Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI, USA). It is used for 
identifying sequences similar to the one being queried in protein or nucleic 
acid databases. This program is designed to find local regions of sequence 
similarity. BLASTP refers to protein sequences and BLASTN to nucleic 
acid sequences. One example is shown in Table 4.1. 
 
The gene SSD1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated by Consuelo 
Montesinos in the laboratory of the author of this book as a gene that by 
modest overexpression (2-fold) dramatically increases the tolerance of the 
cells to intracellular acidification by acetic acid. The protein sequence of 
SSD1 was compared with the data bank of protein sequences using 
BLASTP and the best fifteen results are shown, identifying fungal proteins 
with 67% to 71% identity to Saccharomyces SSD1. It will be interesting to  

Bioinformatics and Evolution 
57 
Table 4.1. Example of results of a BLASTP. Only the top scores are shown. 
 

Chapter 4 
 
58
investigate if these proteins also contribute to tolerance to intracellular 
acidification generated by weak organic acids, such as acetic, propionic 
and sorbic acids. 
 
As shown below, the BLASTP results include the scientific name of the 
organism where the sequence comes from, the score number, the statistical 
E value, the percentage identity with the query sequence, and the 
accession number of the sequence. The E value is a parameter that 
describes the number of hits one can "expect" to see by chance when 
searching a database of a particular size. It decreases exponentially as the 
Score (S) of the match increases. Essentially, the E value describes the 
random background noise. 
4.6. Genomics and proteomics: “big data”  
“Genomics”, the study of all the genes of organisms at the same time, and 
“Proteomics”, the study of all the proteins of organisms at the same time, 
are features of modern biological research. These studies can only be done 
through the use of robots that can manipulate thousands of samples. The 
large amount of data collected can only be managed by “big data” 
technologies (Tolani et al., 2021). Data mining can help to explore, 
develop and verify mechanistic studies and major advances in medical 
biotechnology can be made by utilizing genome sequencing of patients to 
predict the onset of disease. 
 
Bioinformatics focus on analyzing biological data, while data science is a 
much broader field that analyzes data from any number of sources, such as 
phenotypes of different organisms and sequences of population genomes, 
and establish correlations with sensitivity to diseases. One example is 
Genome Wide Analytical Studies (GWAS), an approach where correlations 
are established between genetic markers (for example, Single Nucleotide 
Polymorphisms and where there is variation of a single nucleotide at a 
position of the genome) and phenotypes of interest such as propensity to 
diseases, seed longevity, tolerance of plants to intracellular acidification, 
etc. The results are depicted in the so-called “Manhattan plots” (Figure 
4.7).

CHAPTER 5 
THE DIFFERENT WORKS OF PROTEIN 
NANOMACHINERIES AND THE CHEMICAL 
WORK OF ENZYMES 
 
 
 
5.1 The different works of proteins 
Some proteins, like collagen, have structural roles and others serve for 
nitrogen storage in seeds and eggs. But the most complex proteins perform 
sophisticated works, such as: 
 
a) Chemical works, speeding up metabolic reactions and are called 
enzymes. It must be indicated that some RNAs have catalytic 
power and are called ribozymes. 
b) Mechanical works, acting as motors, helicases, chaperones or 
assembly factors. 
c) Osmotic works, mediating transport across biological membranes. 
d) Regulatory works, controlling gene expression and the activity of 
other proteins. Most cellular proteins have regulatory work and 
control the activity of all the other proteins in cells. A high 
proportion of cellular proteins have regulatory activity and for 
every working protein there are several other proteins controlling 
their expression (at the gene and ribosomal levels), their stability 
and their activity or cellular localization. 
 
One limitation of using protein structural studies to investigate their 
mechanisms is that we cannot make videos of how they change 
conformation, only static pictures of different fixed conformations and we 
must guess how the protein changes from one conformation to the other. 
This will be apparent in the following discussions of protein nano-
machineries. 

The Different Works of Protein Nanomachineries and the Chemical 
Work of Enzymes

5.2. Why enzymes are so specific and efficient  
Enzymes are fantastic catalysts, much more specific and effective than the 
inorganic catalysts utilized by chemists. The atomic structure of enzymes 
has revealed why this is so, showing the tricks of their active sites: 
 
(a) residues for binding substrates  
(b) proximity and orientation of substrates and catalytic groups  
(c) stabilization of the transition state of the reaction.    
 
In a reaction where group “x” is transferred from one substrate (A-x) to 
another (B), the binding of the substrates in the catalytic site of the enzyme 
places them close to each other and in the proper orientation. This is 
unlikely with random collisions in the absence of an enzyme (Figure 5.1). 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1. Proximity and orientation in enzymatic reactions 
5.3 Mechanisms of enzymatic catalysis in reactions 
 of nucleophilic substitutions 
After binding substrates to the active site of enzymes there are several 
mechanisms to stabilize the transition state of a reaction, a crucial process 
in catalysis. Nucleophiles (negative charges) are stabilized by positive 
charges of the enzyme and also by acidic groups donating protons. 
Electrophiles (positive charges) are stabilized by negative charges and by 

Chapter 5 
 
64
carbonyl groups (partial negative charges at the oxygen atom). Basic 
groups at the active site can also accept protons from the substrate.  
An example of a generic reaction of nucleophilic substitution is : A-x + 
BH Æ AH + B-x, with the transfer of an electrophilic group (x+) that 
places a proton (H+) from one nucleophile (A-) to another (B-). In 
hydrolases BH is water (H-OH). In summary: A-: Æ H+ while B-: Æx+. 
 
 The exagerated transition state is: A-  x+  B-  H+. The stabilization of A- 
can be made with positive charges, such as the side chains of the amino 
acids arginine or lysine, metal groups and the amino terminal amino acid. 
Also the acidic groups of the amino acids aspartatic and glutamatic acids 
yield protons (H+) to A-. The stabilization of x+ is made by the negative 
charges of the dissociated form of the amino acids aspartate and glutamate 
and also by the partial negative charge of the carbonyl groups (-CO-). The 
stabilization of B- is made with the positive charges of the side chains of 
the amino acids arginine and lysine or by metals and the positive charge of 
the amino terminal group of proteins. The stabilization of H+ is made by 
bases that accept protons such as histidine, aspartate and glutamate. 
 
An example is the hydrolysis of a phosphate ester: 
 
R-O-PO3-+ HOH >>> R-OH + HO-PO3- 
 
where A- is R-O-, x+ is +PO3- and B- is OH- and H+ is H+ 
 
A concrete example is the reaction of lysozyme, as shown at Figure 5.2.

but only four are shown. NAG corresponds to N-acetyl glucosamine and NAM to 
N-acetyl muramate. The broken bond is the one between central NAM and NAG.

Work of Enzymes 
65 
The mechanism of lysozyme suggested by its atomic structure is shown in 
Figure 5.3. Binding of substrate is made by hydrogen bonds of side chains 
from D101 and W62 and by carbonyl groups of the main chain of amino 
acids at positions 59 and 107. Catalysis is mediated by E35 and D52. In 
the first case, this is by general acid catalysis, where the protonated 
carboxylic group donates a H+ to the oxyanion generated at the transition 
state when the glycosidic bond is broken. In the second case the 
dissociated carboxylic group of D52 stabilizes the positive charge acquired 
by carbon 1 of the substrate when a water molecule attacks the sugar 
residue (electrostatic catalysis).

of transition state. Courtesy of Iowa Wsstern Community College. Adapted from 
Tanaka, Nishinomiya, Gotto, Shimazaki et al., 2021, page 288. 
5.4 Covalent catalysis 
A special mechanism utilized by many enzymes consists in forming an 
intermediate substrate covalently bound to the enzyme while a strong 
nucleophile at the active site of the enzyme facilitates subsequent attack by 
water. The family of serine proteases contains a highly reactive 
nucleophilic serine at position 195 that attacks ester or amide bonds of 
substrates making an acyl-enzyme. Hydrolysis of this intermediate 
substrate is easier than that of the starting substrate (Figure 5.4).  
 
               

Chapter 5 
 
66

The high reactivity of this serine is due to its forming part of a catalytic 
triad that facilitates the dissociation of the hydroxyl group (see Figure 5.5). 
The alcoholic hydrogen of S195 makes a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen 
of a histidine (H57). This side chain contains a hydrogen that makes a 
hydrogen bond with one oxygen of the carboxylate from D102. This chain 
of events stabilizes the alkoxide anion of dissociated serine (Ser195--O-).

5.5 The special work of ligases or synthetases to drive 
biosynthetic reactions 
A category of enzymes known as ligases or synthetases act as 
nanomachines utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis to create new bonds 
by a thermodynamically irreversible reaction. As indicated below, 

The Different Works of Protein Nanomachineries and the Chemical 
Work of Enzymes 
67 
basically the condensation of alcohol and carboxylic acid is made possible 
by avoiding the liberation of a water molecule (due to the fact that high 
concentration of water in the medium opposes the reaction). The reaction 
is divided into two parts: first ATP reacts with the carboxylate group of 
one substrate to make an acyl phosphate intermediate and pyrophosphate 
(PPi). The later product is hydrolyzed by soluble pyrophosphatases. The 
acyl-AMP bond is high energy and in the second step the alcohol substrate 
attacks the carbonyl-AMP bond to create the ester bond. In this way no 
water is liberated during condensation because it is utilized for ATP 
hydrolysis to AMP and PPi. See the scheme below: 
 
 
5.6. Every enzyme is a potential motor 
During the catalytic cycle of enzymes there are conformational changes as 
illustrated in Figure 5.6. 
 
 
Figure 5.6. Changes in conformation during the catalytic cycle of an enzyme. 

Chapter 5 
 
68
The binding of the substrate triggers the first change and conversion into 
product the second one. The number of conformations increases if more 
than one substrate or product is involved. This creates enormous possibilities 
for protein nano-machineries, as will be described in the next chapters.  
 
Visualization of the structure of these multiple conformations is not easy 
because an enzyme performing its catalytic cycle cannot be crystalized for 
X-ray analysis or used for Cryo-Electron Microsocopy as it is continuously 
changing in structure. Therefore, special tricks are needed to fix particular 
conformations, such as, a non-hydrolyzable analogous of ATP that 
contains a nitrogen bridge between the beta and gamma phosphates (AMP-
PNP) in the case of enzymes using ATP, as shown in Figure 5.7. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.7. Structure of AMP-PNP. Courtesy of Brend-enzymes.org. 
 
Another difficulty is that we cannot see videos of the changing conformation 
of an enzyme, as mentioned previously. Therefore, researchers must collect 
structures of different conformations of the protein and make a guess at the 
sequence of events. 
5.7 P-loop is a sequence motif specialized to bind 
nucleotide triphosphates  
Many proteins binding ATP or GTP have a common sequence motif 
between a beta-sheet and an alpha-helix. This sequence is (X means any 
amino acid): GXXXXGK(T/S). It constitutes an anion hole to bind the 

The Different Works of Protein Nanomachineries and the Chemical 
Work of Enzymes

beta- and gamma-phosphate of the ATP or GTP (Saraste, Sibbald and 
Wittinghofer 1990, page 430). One example is shown in Figure 5.8. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.8. Structure of one P-loop. Courtesy of ResearchGate.com. 
5.8 The classes of proteases 
According to the crucial amino acid or prosthetic group in the active center 
there are four classes of proteases:  
 
(a) Serine proteases (Figure 5.5) 
(b) Cysteine proteases (Figure 5.9) 
(c) Aspartyl proteases (Figure 5.10) 
(d) Metalloproteases (Figure 5.11). 
 
In papain (a cysteine protease), the cysteine in position 25 is the attacking 
nucleophile, assisted by the histidine in position 159. The ribbon structure 
of papain and the details of the active site are shown in Figure 5.9. The 
asparagine, histidine and cysteine form a catalytic triad. 
 

Chapter 5 
 
70
 
 
Figure 5.9. Structure of papain, a cysteine protease (top, courtesy of Protein Data 
Bank) and detail of the active site catalytic triad (below, courtesy of puns.rsc.org). 
 
As indicated in Figure 5.10, in renin (an aspartyl protease) the aspartate in 
the active center accepts a proton from a water molecule generating a 
hydroxyl group that attacks the peptide bond of the substrate giving rise to 
a carboxylate and an amine. 
 
As indicated in Figure 5.11B, a metal group (Zn2+) chelates the oxygen of 
the carbonyl group of the peptide bond to be broken. Then the carbon atom 
of the carbonyl group acquires a negative charge and breaks an O-H bond 
in a water molecule. Histidine 231 accepts the proton in the nearby 
nitrogen and the >N-H group of the histidine ring gives a proton to 
aspartate 226. 
 
Protease inhibitors are important drugs. One example is captopril (Figure 
5.11C). This drug inhibits the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), a 
metalloprotease that increases blood pressure.

CHAPTER 6 
PROTEIN NANO-MOTORS AND MECHANICAL 
WORK 
 
 
 
An important motor of eukaryotic cells is myosin, which functions as a 
locomotive moving on rails made of actin filaments. The scheme of this 
dimeric protein is shown in Figure 6.1. One accessory subunit is essential 
for activity and the other contains an EF hand and is regulatory by sensing 
calcium. 
 
The impressive muscles of the rearing horse (Figure 6.2), like the muscles 
of all animals, are powered by the molecular motor protein myosin. A part 
of myosin, the globular catalytic domain, moves dramatically in response 
to ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release, propelling myosin along 
an actin filament (Figure 6.3). This molecular movement is translated into 
the movement of the entire animal, as vividly depicted in Leonardo da 
Vinci’s rearing horse. 
 
The crucial conformational change of the myosin ATPase domain during 
the catalytic cycle is shown in Figure 6.3. At the carboxyl-terminus of this 
domain, some parts move as much as 2.5 nm. The filamentous domain of 
myosin is shown in Figure 6.4.

The regions known as Switch I and Switch II bind to the ATP analogous 
(ADP-N-phosphate) but not to the ADP. A long D-helix changes position 
according to the bound nucleotide. 
 
All these conformational changes are transformed into “walking” over a 
path made by microfilaments of the actin protein. These filaments have 
directionality because the actin molecule is not symmetric and there are 
plus (barbed) and minus (pointed) ends (see Figure 6.8). 
 
 
 
Figure 6.8. An actin filament has directionality. The direction of myosin movement 
is from minus to plus ends. Courtesy of Protein Data Bank. 

Chapter 6 
 
78
The movement of myosin over actin filaments is caused by conformational 
changes of this motor protein (Figure 6.9). When myosin binds ATP, it 
dissociates from the actin filament and when ATP is hydrolyzed there is a 
big conformational change of the lever arm that afterwards allows the 
myosin to bind the actin filament in a different position. Finally, the 
release of phosphate results in the “power stroke”, with the movement of 
actin relative to myosin. The release of ADP from the active site of the 
enzyme allows another reaction cycle.

actin. The myosin head is a circle and the lever arm a line. Small arrows indicate 
the direction of movement of the different parts of the myosin. 
 
Some functions of myosin resemble that of a locomotive pulling wagons 
of cell secretory vesicles to the plasma membranes, where they should 
fuse. It can also move organelles inside cells along actin tracks. 
6.3. Role of myosin in muscle  
A specialized function occurs in the striated muscles of animals, where the 
locomotive activity results in muscle contraction. As indicated in Figure 
6.10 filaments of actin (called thin filaments) are anchored to the so-called 
“Z-lines”, which are made of structural proteins. Myosin molecules are 

Protein Nano-Motors and Mechanical Work

grouped into thick filaments by the inter-binding of their filamentous 
domains. Two groups bound to separate Z lines are joined by interlocking 
their filamentous domains. When the myosin heads walk along thin 
filaments the two connected Z lines approach and the muscle contracts.  
 
Muscle contraction is activated by cytosolic free calcium, which binds to 
the regulatory protein tropomyosin that was blocking the binding sites for 
actin. After binding calcium troponin experiences a conformational change 
and releases these binding sites. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum of muscle cells when a nerve impulse arrives at these cells and a 
component of the troponin complex senses the increase in calcium. In a 
resting muscle fiber, tropomyosin partially covers: (a) calcium binding 
sites on troponin, (b) actin binding sites on myosin, (c) myosin binding 
sites on actin and (d) calcium binding sites on actin.

6.4. Other cellular motors 
Eukaryotic cells contain two other nano-motors, kinesin and dynein, that 
move on tracks made of microtubules (Figure 6.11). Microtubules are 
made of two similar tubulins: D-tubulin andE-tubulin.

Kinesins move organelles, secretory vesicles and chromosomes, while 
dyneins power the movement of cilia and flagella. Microtubules in 
eukaryotic flagella form doublets and aggregate in a complex of nine 
surrounding two single microtubules (Figure 6.12).

The anticancer drug taxol (see Figure 6.14) binds to microtubules and 
stabilizes the polymerized form. Therefore, it is not possible to make new 
microtubules within the cells and growth and proliferation are inhibited.

The structure of kinesin is shown in Figure 6.15. 
 
The kinesin motor has two steps (see Figure 6.16). In the first, the head 
domain with ADP (black neck) binds to the microtubule. Then the ATP 
replaces the ADP and this produces a conformational change and the other 
head domain (black neck) moves ahead. Upon ATP hydrolysis the head 
domain with the black neck moves ahead of the head domain with the red 
neck. Then ATP hydrolysis produces ADP in the head domain with the red 
neck. Finally, the head domain with the red neck moves ahead of the head 
domain with the black neck to complete the cycle.

6.5. Bacteria have a rotary motor in their flagella 
Bacteria swim by rotating their flagella. This motor spins on a central axis 
instead of moving along a track. The structure of bacterial flagella is 
shown in Figure 6.17. It contains many different types of proteins: the 
flagellum itself is made of the protein flagellin which can be recognized by 
the defenses against plant pathogens. After a hook it crosses the outer 
membrane (L ring) and the peptidoglycan layer (P ring) and finally is 
inserted in the inner membrane at the MS ring, surrounded by another ring 
made by the proteins MotA and MotB.  
 

Protein Nano-Motors and Mechanical Work 
83 
The proton gradient across the inner bacterial membrane forces the uptake 
of protons and this causes the rotation of the flagella by a mechanism 
described in Figure 6.17. The MotA subunits have two half proton-
channels and H+ movements force rotation of the MS ring. When protons, 
driven by the electrical membrane potential positive outside, enter the cell 
they go through the external half-channel and to complete the entrance 
into the cell they force the counter-clockwise rotation of the MS ring to 
bridge the separation of the two half-channels. Finally, protons are 
released through the inner half-channels (see Figure 6.18). This 
mechanism is similar to the one of the rotary ATPases that will be 
described in Chapter 8 (Figure 8.19).

(courtesy of commons.wikipedia.org). B: a schematic view. 
 
However, the bacterial flagella are more complicated than the rotary 
ATPases and contain many more subunits.

CHAPTER 7 
REGULATION OF GENE TRANSCRIPTION 
 
 
 
7.1. Promoters, enhancers (UAS) and repressing sequences 
(URS) 
As indicated in Figure 7.1, upstream of the TATA box of eukaryotic 
promoters there are Upstream Activating Sequences (UAS) and Upstream 
Repressing Sequences (URS) that can be recognized by different 
transcription factors. They not only promote or hinder the recruitment of 
RNA polymerase II but also recruit the machineries that modify the 
chromatin structure to activate or inhibit accessibility. 
 
 
Figure 7.1. The basics of regulation of gene expression. 
 
In bacteria and their viruses (phages), genes coding for functionally related 
proteins are clustered into operons, and are under the control of a single 
promoter. Transcription produces a single mRNA that is either translated 
directly or cut into mono-cistronic mRNAs.  
 

Chapter 7 
 
86
7.2. RNA polymerases and helicases 
RNA polymerase II unwinds the template double helix. This is made by 
the preferential binding of single strand DNA without the need of ATP. 
Then RNA polymerase catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of the 3c-hydroxyl 
group of the last nucleotide in the chain to the Į phosphoryl group of the 
incoming nucleoside triphosphate, and pyrophosphate (PPi) is produced as 
in DNA replication (Figure 7.2). 
 
 
 
Figure 7.2. The reaction of RNA polymerase. Courtesy of web-books.com. 
 
The RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli has 5 subunits and the TATA 
binding protein is subunit V It is important to distinguish between the 
RNA transcript, the template/antisense strand and the coding/sense strand 
(Figure 7.3).

RNA polymerase distinguishes between sense and antisense strands 
because the TATA box has directionality (Figure 7.4).

RNA polymerases backtrack and correct errors but the final error rate (1 
mistake/104-105 nucleotides) is higher than that for DNA replication (1 
mistake /109-1010 nucleotides). The human genome has 3 x 109 bp and 
therefore there is 1 or no errors at all during replication of the whole 
genome. On the other hand, mRNAs have from 300 to 3000 nucleotides 
and therefore there are almost no errors during transcription of one 
particular mRNA. 
 
RNA polymerases bind to promoter sites on the DNA template and initiate 
transcription. In bacteria the core promoter contains a TATA box 
(TATAAT) at 10 nucleotides before the transcription start site (-10) and 
another recognized motif (TTGACA) at -35: 
 
5’…….TTGATA…………..TATAAT…………Transcription start site 
 
 
 
It must be indicated that the above motifs are consensus 
sequences of different motifs that may differ at some position of the 
consensus. In bacteria the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase recognizes 
both the -10 and -35 motifs.  
 
There are alternative bacterial promoters recognized by 
alternative sigma subunits, as indicated in Figure 7.5.

Another important aspect is that RNA polymerases require no primers 
while DNA polymerases require primers to start replication. Elongation of 
mRNA takes place at transcription bubbles that move along the DNA. 
(Figure 7.6) 

Chapter 7 
 
88
 
Figure 7.6. Transcription bubble during transcription. In blue and red the two 
strands of DNA and in green the emerging mRNA. 
 
Termination of transcription is better understood in bacteria, where it is 
determined by sequences of the transcribed RNA that make a hairpin and a 
repetition of uracils (see Figure 7.7).  
 
 
Figure 7.7. A hairpin and a repetition of uracils signal transcriptional termination 
in bacteria. 
 
Finally, the prokaryotic protein Rho (U) acts as an ATP-dependent helicase 
that binds the nascent RNA chain and pulls it away from the transcription 
bubble of RNA polymerase and the DNA template. It is an example of 
mechanical work with ATP energy (Figure 7.8).   
 

Regulation of Gene Transcription 
89 
 
 
Figure 7.8. The Rho helicase utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pull the 
mRNA away of the transcription bubble. 
 
Transcription termination is different in eukaryotes. In RNA polymerase I, 
the “transcription termination factor” binds downstream of the pre-rRNA 
coding regions, causing the dissociation of the RNA polymerase from the 
template and the release of the new RNA strand. In RNA polymerase II, 
the termination occurs via a polyadenylation/cleaving complex. The 3' tail 
on the end of the strand is bound at the polyadenylation site, but the strand 
will continue to code. The newly synthesized ribonucleotides are removed 
one at a time by the cleavage factors CSTF and CPSF, in a process that is 
still not fully understood. The remainder of the strand is disengaged by a 
5ƍ-exonuclease when the transcription is finished. RNA polymerase III 
terminates after the addition of uracil residues in the transcribed mRNA. 
Unlike in bacteria and in RNA polymerase I, the termination hairpin needs 
to be upstream to allow for correct cleaving. In RNA polymerase I, a 
transcription termination factor binds downstream of pre-RNA coding 
region. See Xie et al., 2023. 
7.4. Antibiotics that inhibit transcription 
There are some important antibiotics that inhibit transcription in different 
biological systems. Rifampicin (see Figure 7.9) inhibits initiation of RNA 
synthesis in bacteria but not in eukaryotes. It binds to a pocket in the 
channel occupied by the newly formed RNA-DNA hybrid in bacterial 
RNA polymerase.

D-Amanitin (Figure 7.11) strongly inhibits RNA polymerase II of 
eukaryotes, with little or no effect on polymerases I and III.

7.5. Types of transcription factors 
The central role of transcription factors for life was a discovery of Roger 
D. Kornberg (Figure 7.12), who proposed that transcription factors 
regulate the expression of the genetic message and who received the 2006 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry. All transcription factors contain a DNA binding 
domain and a domain for interaction with proteins involved in transcription, 
including RNA polymerases, and chromatin remodeling proteins. 
Sometimes these interactions occur through intermediate mediator proteins.

There are several kinds of transcription factors (TFs) classified by their 
DNA-binding domains and oligomerization domains. As indicated in 

Chapter 7

Figure 7.13, Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are trimers with monomers bound 
by leucine zipper repeats (Perisic, Xiao and Lis, 1989, page 797).

orientations. 
 
They bind to DNA sequences known as the heat shock promoter elements 
(HSPE) with the sequence xGAAxxTTCxxGAAx, where “x” is any 
nucleotide. A scheme of the binding is shown in Figure 7.13 and a more 
detailed view in Figure 7.14 (Perisic, Xiao and Lis 1989, pages 797-806).

into the major groove of the DNA for recognition.

Basic-leucine zippers are heterodimers of two basic-leucine zipper 
proteins stabilized by the zippers. The basic regions are intercalated into 
the major groove of the DNA (Figure 7.16).

site in DNA. Courtesy of es.m.wikipedia.org 
 
Transcription factors with zinc-finger domains are a family containing 
several structures with a Zn+2 cation chelated by two cysteines and two 
histidines (see Figures 7.17 and 7.18)

Another important kind of transcription factor are the mammalian nuclear 
receptors for hydrophobic hormones, such as estradiol, retinoic acid and 
thyroxine (see Figure 7.19). These hydrophobic hormones diffuse into 
cells and reach the nucleus to bind these transcription factors.

trans-retinoic acid (a retinoid). Courtesy of researchgate.net.  
 
 
 

Regulation of Gene Transcription 
95 
Nuclear hormone receptors have two functional domains, a DNA-binding 
domain and a ligand-binding domain made of zinc fingers (Figure 7.20 B). 
When the hormone binds to its site a conformational change occurs at the 
DNA binding domain and then the transcription factor becomes able to 
bind DNA (compare Figures 7.20 A and 17.20 C).

7.6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
The DNA sequences recognized by transcription factors can be determined 
“in vitro” by so-called retardation gels. Labeled double strand oligonucleotides 
are incubated with the purified protein and the mixture is run in an 
electrophoresis gel to separate DNA molecules. If the oligonucleotide 
binds to the tested protein its motility is greatly reduced. This procedure 
does not ensure that this binding occurs “in vivo” because many regions of 
chromatin are blocked by histones in nucleosomes (see below) and are not 
functional “in vivo”.  
 
The method called “Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation” (ChIP) determines 
DNA binding sites under “in vivo” conditions (Figure 7.21). 
 

Chapter 7 
 
96
 
 
Figure 7.21. The steps of a ChIP experiment. A purple protein is used as an 
example 
 
Cells or tissues are first fixed with formaldehyde, which intertwines amino 
groups of the protein of interest with amino groups of nucleotides bound 
to it (step 1). Then chromatin (DNA plus associated proteins) is isolated 
(step 2) and sonicated to fragment it into small pieces which should 
contain a single protein (step 3). Then the fragments containing the protein 
investigated are isolated by use of a specific antibody that will bind to the 
protein in question (step 4). There are bacterial proteins (protein A and 
protein G) that bind to the Fc part of antibodies (IgGs), a domain common 
to all antibodies produced by an animal. If these A or G proteins are 
immobilized in some spherical material such as Sepharose, the 
transcription factor and its recognized sequence can be easily isolated. 
Then the crosslinking of the formaldehyde is reversed by high concentrations 
(0.1 M) of a substance such as glycine with amino groups (step 5). Finally, 
the free DNA fragment is sequenced or detected by PCR or hybridization. 
It is usually found that the sites bound “in vivo” by a transcription factor 
are only a small fraction of the identical sequences found in the genome 
that are recognized “in vitro” by the protein. 
7.7. Protein complexes involved in eukaryotic 
transcription and splicing 
Eukaryotes have three types of RNA polymerase that can be differentiated 
by their sensitivity to D-amanitin (see Figure 7.11), a poison produced by 
the mushroom Amanita phalloides (see Figure 7.22). The eating of this 
mushroom is a common cause of poisoning of unaware mushroom 
collectors.  

Regulation of Gene Transcription 
97

(right). Courtesy of Getty Images. 
 
Type I RNA polymerases are insensitive to D-amanitin and transcribe the 
28S, 18S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Its promoter contains a 
TATA-like transcriptional initiator sequence and an upstream promoter 
element. Type II RNA polymerases are very sensitive to D-amanitin and 
transcribe mRNAs for translation into proteins. Additional promoter 
elements to the TATA box of this RNA polymerase are the CAAT box 
(5’-GCNCAATCT) and the GC box (5’-GGGCGG). Type III RNA 
polymerases have little sensitivity to D-amanitin and transcribe 5S rRNA 
and the tRNAs involved in protein synthesis at the ribosomes. The 
initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is shown in Figure 7.23. 
 
 
 
Figure 7.23. The initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II involves 
formation of protein complexes at the initiation site. 
 

Chapter 7 
 
98
Transcription factor II for RNA polymerases II, has several subunits 
named A, B, D, E and F. The TFIID protein initiates the assembly of the 
transcription complex and includes the TATA binding protein (TBP). The 
ten-subunit TFIIH factor opens the DNA double helix by a helicase using 
ATP hydrolysis. It also phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the RNA 
polymerase II to leave the promoter and start transcription 
 
The initial mRNA transcript undergoes two modifications: a 5’-cap and a 
3’-polyA tail. The 5’-cap includes a 7-methylguanilate (see Figure 7.24) 
and the methylation of some adjacent riboses. The polyA tail is made by 
two enzymes: an RNAse that recognizes a signal sequence (AAUAAA) 
and cleaves the nascent mRNA and then a poly (A) polymerase that adds 
up to 200 adenylates from the ATP, which is split into AMP and PPi (see 
Figure 7.25). Both modifications improve the translation and stability of 
the mRNA.

Figure 7.25. Polyadenylation of a primary transcript. 
 
Primary transcripts of eukaryotic mRNAs contain coding sequences 
(exons) and insertions of non-coding sequences (introns) that must be 
removed by a process called “splicing” (see Figure 7.26). Sequences at the 
ends of introns specify splicing sites (see Figure 7.27). The splicing 
machinery, called the spliceosome, is made of small nuclear RNAs with 
catalytic activity (ribozymes) and structural proteins.

Chapter 7 
 
100
The splicing reaction (see Figure 7.28) proceeds as follows: the 2´OH of a 
ribose at the branch site makes a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate 
bridge between exon 1 and the intron, forming a lariat intermediate. Then 
the liberated 3´end of the exon1 attacks the phosphate bridge between the 
exon 2 and the intron, giving rise to the spliced product and the liberated 
intron in lariat form. No energy in the form of ATP is needed because in 
the lariat intermediate a new bond is formed and another is broken and the 
same happens to generate the final products.

It has been proposed that exons encode structural modules of proteins and 
that the recombination of exons in the course of evolution (exon shuffling) 
has contributed to the generation of protein diversity (Gö 1985, page 91). 
 
As indicated in Figure 7.28, polyadenylation, capping and splicing occur 
in eukaryotes when nascent mRNAs are still bound to the transcriptional 
complex

7.6. Epigenetic modifications 
DNA in chromatin is bound to histones (Figure 7.30). DNA wraps up 
around histone octamers making cylindrical structures known as 
nucleosomes (Figure 7.31). The amino-terminal basic tail of the histones 
interacts with the negatively charged phosphates of DNA. Octamers have 
two copies each of histones 2A, 2B, 3 and 4. The core of nucleosomes 
have a diameter of 10 nm and 146 base pairs (bp). The linker between 
nucleosomes has 55 bp and binds histone 1.

Epigenetic modifications are those that do not affect the coding of genes 
but changing their expression and these modifications can be inherited. 
The French scientist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (see Figure 7.32) postulated 
the inheritance of acquired characters long time ago but at his time this 
was not taken into consideration because of the opposition of Charles 
Darwin (Figure 7.33), whose ideas pointed to random genetic variation 
and natural selection, without inheritance of acquired characters 
(Burkhardt Jr. 2013, page 793).

Chromatin has several levels of packing as indicated in Table 7.1. After 
the nucleosome there are helical arrays of nucleosomes, also called the 30 
nm chromatin fiber (Wu, Bassett and Travers 2007, page 1129). This is 
followed by interphase chromosomes and metaphase chromosomes. The 
packing factor is defined as the length of naked DNA divided by the 
length of the chromatin level considered.

The inheritance of acquired characters was first observed in bacteria, 
which methylate its DNA at cytosines to protect it from degradation by 
restriction endonucleases. Both the restriction enzyme and the methylase 
are encoded by the same operon. When cells duplicate their DNA these 
enzymes are distributed between the two copies of DNA and the 
methylation is inherited. 
 
In eukaryotes histone acetylases (HAT) add acetyl groups from acetyl-
coenzymeA (acetyl CoA) to the lysines in the histone N-terminal tails 
(Figures 7.34 and 7.35). This reaction eliminates the positive charge of 
histones and inhibits their interaction with the negative charges of the 
phosphates in DNA. The enzymes histone deacetylases remove the acetyl 
groups from the lysines and facilitate the interaction of histones with 
DNA.

part is from Figure 7.30 and the acetylated lysine is a courtesy of 
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. 
 
In addition, acetylation of histones is recognized by bromodomains, which 
bind acetylated lysines in the histones. These domains are present in 
chromatin remodeling machineries, systems that utilize ATP hydrolysis to 
break nucleosomes in one particular site and remake them in another site. 
Other epigenetic reactions are those of histone methyl-transferases (Figure 
7.36) and of DNA methyl-transferases (Figure 7.37). Histone methylation 
is required for DNA methylation because the DNA methyl-transferases 
contain chromodomains that recognize histone methylation. The later 
modification hampers the interaction of transcription factors with the large 
groove of DNA. DNA methylation is reversed by DNA demethylases.

First, a transcription factor binds to its regulatory sequence in DNA (step 
1). Then, binding of an intermediate coactivator protein helps recruitment 
of histone acetyl-transferase to acetylate histone tails (step 2). The next 
step is the recruitment of a chromatin remodeling machinery by binding 
acetylated histone tails through its bromodomain (step 3). Movements of 
nucleosomes mediated by the chromatin remodeling machinery expose 
transcription initiation sites in DNA (step 4) that are recognized by the 
initiation complex of RNA polymerase II. 
 
A derivative of cytidine known as 5-azacytidine (see Figure 7.41) can 
activate gene expression in growing cells because it cannot be methylated 
(this should occur at position 5, which is changed) and also inhibits DNA 
methyl-transferase.

DNA methylation is analyzed with the restriction enzyme Hpa II, which 
cleaves CCGG sites but cannot do so if any of the cytosines are 
methylated. As shown in Figure 7.42, after cutting mouse DNA with Hpa 
II most of the DNA is not cut while in Drosophila and Escherichia coli 
DNA is fully cut.

CHAPTER 8 
MEMBRANE PROTEINS INVOLVED  
IN TRANSPORT ACROSS BIOLOGICAL 
MEMBRANES AND BIOPHYSICAL  
REGULATION OF CELLULAR ACTIVITIES 
 
 
 
8.1. Ion homeostasis: the role of major cellular ions 
Nucleic acids, especially RNA, are the major source of negative charges 
inside cells. The negative charges of nucleic acids correspond to the 
phosphate groups between nucleotides: 
 
adenine-ribose-phosphate-…uracil-ribose-phosphate- ……. 
 
The concentration of these negative charges inside cells if they were not 
incorporated to the nucleic acids would be 0.1-0.2 M. Inorganic phosphate 
(Pi) and phosphorylated metabolites could contribute another 10-20 mM 
and chloride another 1-20 mM. 
 
Concerning cations, potassium (K+) at 0.1-0.2 M is the major positive 
charge neutralizing the negative charges of nucleic acids. In addition, K+ is 
the bigger contributor to cellular osmotic concentration and turgor and is 
required for the proper activity of ribosomes and by some metabolic 
enzymes. 
 
Protons (H+, 10-6-10-7 M, pH 6-7) have important permissive and 
regulatory roles of intracellular and extracellular pH. Permissive refers to 
allowing some activities, for example the optimum pH of enzymes. 
Regulatory refers to modulation of the activity of crucial proteins for 
metabolism, cell growth and proliferation. Protons are essential for the 
chemiosmotic circuit of most prokaryotes, fungi and plants. 
 

Membrane Proteins Involved in Transport across Biological Membranes  
and Biophysical Regulation of Cellular Activities 
111 
Sodium (Na+, § 10 mM) is toxic at high concentrations by counteracting 
K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ but is essential to animals for the plasma membrane 
chemiosmotic circuit and osmotic regulation. Na+ extrusion compensates 
for the colloid osmotic pressure of macromolecules (see below). 
 
Calcium (Ca2+, 0.1-1 μM free, § 1 mM bound) has a structural role in 
membranes and a regulatory role as a second messenger. High 
concentrations would precipitate with phosphates. 
 
Magnesium (Mg2+, § 1 mM free, 10 mM bound) is required by many 
enzymes either directly or with nucleotide triphosphates. 
 
Iron (Fe3+/2+, 0.1-1μM free, § 1 mM bound) is required by many enzymes 
in the form of either heme groups or iron-sulfur complexes in proteins. 
High concentrations produce oxidative stress. 
 
Finally, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ are oligo-elements present as prosthetic 
groups in many proteins. 
8.2. The two chemiosmotic circuits: the one of sodium 
showed up first, the one of protons later  
When students hear “ion homeostasis”, their response is one of surprise 
(Figure 8.1). They have rarely heard these words! Ion homeostasis has two 
aspects: ion transporters and their regulation. 
 
In present-day organisms there are two chemiosmotic circuits: one based 
on Na+ and another based on H+ (Figure 8.2). Intracellular potassium provides 
ionic strength and turgor while sodium, chloride and protons are toxic and 
must be extruded. The sodium circuit, on the left part of the figure, is the 
animal solution, although a few prokaryotes also use this type of circuit. It 
is based on a plasma membrane enzyme called Na+/K+- ATPase which 
couples the hydrolysis of one ATP to ADP and phosphate (Pi) to the 
extrusion of three sodium ions and the uptake of two potassium ions. 
Therefore, it is electrogenic and generates a modest (§ 60 mV) membrane 
potential ('<). 
 
The proton circuit, on the right part of the figure, is the solution adopted 
by plants, fungi and most prokaryotes. In this case, the plasma membrane 
contains H+-pumping ATPase which couples hydrolysis of one ATP 
molecule to ADP and Pi to the extrusion of one or more protons. The 

Chapter 8 
 
112
achieved membrane potentials are much greater than in animal plasma 
membranes, of the order of 150-250 mV. Animal cells have low turgor 
because they lack rigid cell walls. The cells of bacteria, fungi and plants 
have rigid cell walls and have high turgor.

113 
The universal principle of monovalent cation homeostasis is the uptake of 
K+ and the efflux of Cl-, Na+, and H+. Ki+ provides ionic strength and 
turgor. Nai+, Cli- and Hi+ are toxic. Na+ extrusion compensates for the 
colloid osmotic pressure of macromolecules (see below) and the 
membrane potential ('<) is positive outside. 
 
One plausible view of the evolution of ion homeostasis (Wilson and Lin, 
1980, page 421) is shown in Figure 8.3.  
 
 
 
Figure 8.3. Postulated evolution of ion homeostasis 
 
Life started in the sea, which originally covered the entire surface of the 
planet. Lipid membranes have low permeability to ions, but given enough 
time small ions finally equilibrate at both sides of the cellular membrane. 
However, macromolecules are completely non-permeable. This generates 
the entry of water because of the so-called “colloid osmotic pressure of 
intracellular macromolecules”. To avoid osmotic lysis, cells developed ion 
transporters to mediate the exit of Na+ and Cl- and the entry of K+. 
 
Another view of the evolution of ion homeostasis (Raven and Smith, 1975, 
page 301) is that primitive organisms used oxidation of aldehydes to acids 
to generate ATP (as it occurs in glycolysis today) and that this process 
acidified the cell interior. Accordingly, cells developed proton pumps 
which extruded H+, energized first with light energy and later with ATP 
hydrolysis. 
 

Chapter 8 
 
114
Also, the transporters must be finely regulated to avoid incidents. Sherlock 
Holmes is famous for recognizing the “importance of absence”, the things 
that did not happen. In one of the Sherlock Holmes novels a crime was 
committed during the night and the detective asked a servant:  
 
“Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” 
“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.” 
“The dog did nothing in the night-time.” 
“That was the curious incident.” 
 
Clearly, the dog knew the criminal (Doyle 1902, page 89 and Knoll 2003, 
page 170). The things that do not happen with the transporters are their 
fine regulations to avoid incidents such as excessive or insufficient 
accumulation of substrates at one side of the membrane (see Figure 8.4). 
Some possible incidents are: excessive accumulation of intracellular 
protons (intracellular acidification), too little accumulation of intracellular 
protons (intracellular alkalinization), too much accumulation of intracellular 
potassium (K+) causing osmotic bursting of the cells, and too little 
accumulation of potassium producing osmotic shrinking of the cells. A 
sophisticated regulation avoids these incidents in evolved cells. 
 
 
 
Figure 8.4. Possible incidents during ion transport 
 
Concerning the question of what was the first chemiosmotic circuit, there 
is evidence pointing to the Na+ circuit as the ancestral one and the H+ 
circuit as derived from the latter. The evidence will be discussed when we 
learn below about the two types of cation-pumping ATPases. 

Membrane Proteins Involved in Transport across Biological Membranes  
and Biophysical Regulation of Cellular Activities 
115 
8.3. Pumps, channels and transporters 
Active transporters are the ones that are able to concentrate substrates at 
one side of the membrane, accumulating substrates inside cells or 
extruding substrates from the cell interior. A distinction must be made 
between primary and secondary active transporters and passive 
transporters (see Figure 8.5). Primary active transporters, or pumps, are 
coupled to either the energy of light or red-ox reactions or to the 
hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 
they pump either protons (H+) or sodium (Na+). Secondary active 
transporters are of three types. Symporters couple the movement of H+ or 
Na+ with the movement of other molecules in the same direction. 
Antiporters couple the movement of H+ or Na+ with the movement of 
other molecules in the opposite direction.  
 
A uniporter transports a single molecule, and this may be passive transport 
if the substrate has no electrical charges, but if this is not the case and the 
membrane has an electrical potential, it could accumulate substrates at one 
side of the membrane (depending of the positive or negative charge of the 
molecule) and be considered secondary active transport. There are two 
kinds of uniporters: channels and transporters of facilitated diffusion.

Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump containing as a prosthetic 
group the pigment retinal bound to the amino group of a lysine in the 
protein (lysine 216). Light absorption induces a conformational change at 
the double bond of carbon 13, from the all-trans to the C13-cis and this 
moves the proton at carbon 16 of the retinal from facing the interior of the 
cell to facing the exterior (see Figure 8.6 A).

There is evidence pointing to the sodium circuit as the ancestral form. In a 
publication by the Russian author Eugene V. Koonin (Mulkidjanian, 
Galperin, Makarova, Wolf et al. 2008, page 13; see Figure 8.6) he studied 
within the evolutionary tree of the family of rotary ATPases the specificity 
of cation pumped H+ or Na+, and found that Na+ pumping enzymes were 

Chapter 8 
 
118
present all over the tree mixed with H+ pumping ones. Studying the 
structure of the enzyme subunit “c” binding the transported cation in 
rotary ATPases (Figures 8.7B and 8.8) it was found that in Na+-pumping 
enzymes there are four ligands of the cation: glutamine, glutamate, serine 
or threonine, and the carbonyl group of valine or leucine. However, in H+-
pumping enzymes two ligands are missing, the glutamine and the 
serine/threonine, and therefore Na+ cannot be bound. The glutamate ligand 
remains and can only bind H+. Therefore, the logical scenario is that Na+ 
was the first cation pumped by this family of enzymes and that, by loss of 
ligands, the H+ pumping enzymes appeared.  
 
 
 
Figure 8.8. Schematic ribbon diagram of the subunit c that binds the transported 
Na+ in rotary ATPases. 
 
The structure of one P-ATPase, the Na+/K+-ATPase of animal cells, is 
shown in Figure 8.9. This enzyme pumps 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in and 
therefore is electrogenic and generates a modest electrical potential across 
the plasma membrane (§ 60 mV) and modest gradients of Na+ (up to 5-
fold more outside than inside) and K+ (up to 10-fold more inside than 
outside). There are four more types of P-ATPases with similar structures 
with the exception of the membrane part (with the cation binding sites) 
and the external loops. These loops demonstrate that only the Na+/K+-
ATPase is inhibited from outside the cells by cardiotonic steroids, as we 
will see later. 
 
 
 

Membrane Proteins Involved in Transport across Biological Membranes  
and Biophysical Regulation of Cellular Activities 
119 
The H+-ATPase of plants and fungi has a stoichiometry of 1 H+ pumped 
per 1 ATP hydrolyzed. It creates enormous pH gradients (up to 5 more 
units of pH inside than outside) or enormous electrical membrane 
potentials up to 300 mV (Serrano 1985, pages 39-47). The gastric H+/K+-
ATPase has a stoichiometry of 2 H+ outside the cell and 2 K+ inside per 1 
ATP hydrolyzed. It is not electrogenic and is responsible for the 
acidification of the gastric juice. The drug omeprazole is a very potent and 
specific inhibitor of gastric acidification, ten times more potent than the 
previously-used drug cimetidine.

en.wikipedia.org. 
 
The specificity of omeprazole is based on the fact that the drug is 
converted to the active form by a very acid pH that only occurs in stomach 
juice (Figure 8.10). The sulfur atom of omeprazole becomes activated as a 
nucleophile by an acid-induced rearrangement of the molecule. Then it 
forms a disulfide bridge with a sulfhydryl group of the H+/K+-ATPase that 
is essential for activity (Wallmark 1986, pages 11-16). 
 
There are two kinds of Ca2+- pumping ATPases. The plasma membrane 
enzyme has a stoichiometry of 1 Ca2+ moving out and 2 H+ moving in per 
one ATP hydrolyzed (Brini and Carafoli 2011, page a004168). The 
ATPase of endoplasmic (sarcoplasmic in muscle) reticulum has the same 
stoichiometry (Toyoshima 2009, page 941).

There are also signs of evolutionary primacy of sodium in P-ATPases 
(Bublitz, Poulsen, Morth and Nissen 2010, page 1). These enzymes have 
4-5 acidic groups (aspartate and glutamate) in the cation binding sites of 
Na+, K+ and Ca2+ P-ATPases, but only one acidic group in H+ P-ATPase. 
It is plausible that, as in the case of rotary ATPases, the ancestral enzyme 
was pumping sodium and by loss of binding sites the proton pumps 
appeared. 
8.4. The mechanisms of primary active transporters  
or pumps 
All enzymes can perform work by conformational changes triggered by 
binding and releasing substrates and products. In the case of ATPases we 
have four possible conformations (E1-4, Figure 8.11). For example, E1 is 
the conformation of enzyme without bound substrate or product, E2 is the 
conformation with bound substrate (ATP in this example), E3 is the 
conformation with bound products (ADP and phosphate in this case) and 
E4 is the conformation bound to only one of the products (ADP in this 
case).

Figure 8.11. The four conformations of an ATPase during its reaction cycle. If there 
were more than one substrate the number of conformations would increase. 
 
The mechanism of a P-ATPases pumping Ca2+, in a plasma membrane or 
endoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) reticulum, is shown in Figure 8.12. 
 
 
Figure 8.12. The four stages of a calcium-pumping P-ATPase. 
 
There are a few rules that the enzyme must follow to change conformation 
and perform transmembrane transport. Starting with the E2 conformation 
of the non-phosphorylated enzyme bound to two protons, it has the 
calcium binding site exposed to the inside of the membrane (inside the 
cytosol or out of the endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum) with a high 
affinity and the proton binding site exposed to outside with a low affinity. 
After releasing 2 H+ the Ca2+.E1 form has auto-kinase activity and 
catalyzes the transfer of the J-phosphate of ATP to an aspartyl residue in 
the conserved motif DKTGTLT of the enzyme (Thever and Saier 2009, 
page 115). This turns the enzyme into a form with the proton binding site 
facing the cytosol or out of the endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum 
with a high affinity and the calcium binding site facing outside with a low 
affinity. Proton binding converts the enzyme into the E2 conformation of 
the phosphorylated enzyme that has auto-phosphatase activity and gets 
dephosphorylated in a reaction depending on a conserved TGES motif 

Chapter 8 
 
122
(Thever and Saier 2009, page 115), leading to the start of a new reaction 
cycle.  
 
It has been proposed that there are switching loops in the enzyme with the 
two conserved motifs for the two states E1 (DKTGTLT) and E2 (TGES) 
and the crucial change is the replacement at the active site of one of the 
motifs by the other (Serrano 1988, page 1). This mechanism is valid for all 
the P-ATPases. 
 
The P-ATPases were discovered by Jens C. Skou (Figure 8.13), who 
found the Na+/K+ ATPas. He was born in Lemvig, Denmark in 1918 and 
died in 2018 in Aarhus, Denmark. He received the 1997 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry. The chemiosmotic circuit of animal cells is based on Na+, and 
the Na+/K+ ATPase is its driver.   
 
Na+/K+ ATPase is inhibited by cardiotonic steroids, such as digitonin 
(Figure 8.14) from the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea). This natural 
drug works by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase and is used to treat 
congestive heart failure. The partial inhibition of the enzyme decreases the 
Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane and this reduces the exit of 
calcium from cells by the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter. The increase in intracellular 
calcium stimulates the cardiac muscle. The foxglove plant is very 
dangerous because its fruits resemble strawberries and every year some 
hikers die from eating these berries and inhibiting their Na+/K+ ATPase. 
This collapses the essential Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane of 
animal cells.

A completely different mechanism is utilized by the rotary ATPase of 
bacteria, mitochondria and the vacuoles in plants that are equivalent to 
lysosomes in animals.  
 
The rotary ATPases were discovered by Efraim Racker (born in Neu 
Dandez, Poland, now Austria, in 1913 and died in 1991) in calf 
mitochondria (see Figure 8.15 right). He performed the crucial experiment 
to demonstrate the chemiosmotic theory of Peter Mitchell (born in 
Mitchum, Surrey, in 1920 and died in 1992, recipient of the 1978 Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry) (see Figure 8.15 left).

This experiment consisted of placing in the same liposome (an artificial 
lipid vesicle) bacteriorhodopsin (a light-driven proton pump from 
Halobacterium halobium, an archaea from the Dead Sea) and the 
mitochondrial ATPase (rotary, reversible ATPase transporting protons) 
(see Figure 8.16). Racker should have shared in the Nobel Prize given to 
Mitchell.

Figure 8.16. The crucial experiment of Efraim Racker to demonstrate the 
chemiosmotic theory of Peter Mitchell. 
 
Scientists resistant to Mitchell’s chemiosmotic theory argued that a 
phosphorylated intermediate similar to the acyl phosphate in the glycolysis 
(1,3-diphosphoglycerate) could still be the missing energy for making 
ATP. The Racker experiment clearly demonstrated that the only connection 
between the supplier of energy (Bacteriorhodopsin) and the machinery that 
made the ATP (the mitochondrial ATPase) was a proton gradient because 
only purified components were used. 
 
The structure of the mitochondrial Fo.F1 ATPase/synthase (it can operate 
in both directions) has been solved by Cryo-electron microscopy in the 
laboratory of Werner Kühlbrandt (Figure 8.17). 
 
The mechanism of rotary ATPases was solved by John E. Walker (born in 
Halifax, Yorkshire, United Kingdom, in 1941 and still alive) (see Figure 
8.18 left) who received the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with 
Paul D. Boyer (born in Provo, Utah, USA, 1918 and died in 2018) (see 
Figure 8.18 right).

One curious incident is that during the 8th European Bioenergetic 
Conference (celebrated in Valencia, Spain, in 1994 and organized by the 
author of this book) there was a discussion between an American 
participant and John E. Walker. The American had crystallized the 
mitochondrial ATPase and found that the three catalytic E subunits had the 
same conformation. On the other hand, John E. Walker found three 
different conformations of the three E subunits. Paul D. Boyer had 
proposed a mechanism based on three different conformations of these 
subunits (Figure 8.19 A). What came out of the discussion was that the 
American group had worked on the assumption of three identical 
conformations of catalytic subunits to facilitate the solution of the 
structure while John E. Walker did not use this simplification and found 
three different conformations. In the O conformation the catalytic site was 
empty, in the L conformation the catalytic site contained ADP and Pi and 
in the T conformation the catalytic site contained ATP.

lower part ATP hydrolysis occurs by O > T> L > O sequence. B: the structure and 
rotary mechanism of mitochondrial ATPase with two half-channels for protons 
bridged by the rotation of subunit “c”. Courtesy of jbc.org. 
 
The complete structure of the mitochondrial ATPase is shown in Figures 
8.17 and 8.19B. There is a static part and a rotary one. The first contains 
the F1 part, protruding from the membrane, with three catalytic subunits E 
subunits) and three structural subunits (D subunits) with similarity to the E 
subunits. The FO part is embedded into the membrane and contains a “c” 
subunit with two half proton channels, one facing the same side than the F1 
part and the other facing the other side of the membrane. These two half 
channels are not communicated. Therefore, in order for the proton to cross 
the membrane a bridge must be operative. This bridge is provided by the 
rotating multimer (10-12 molecules of “c” subunits). Synthesis of ATP 
occurs when the rotation is in a counter-clockwise direction and ATP 
hydrolysis when rotation is in a clockwise direction. The “c” subunit 
contains a proton binding site (aspartate or glutamate) in the middle of the

membrane and during rotation communicates the two half proton channels, 
taking a proton from one side of the membrane and releasing it at the other 
side. This energy transducing mechanism is similar to that of bacterial 
flagella (see Figure 6.18).
8.5. Channels and transporters  
Channels allow the free movement of polar molecules in hydrophobic 
phospholipid membranes through a pore. One example is the Shaker type 
of K+ channels, identified for the first time in a mutant of Drosophila 
melanogaster that could not stop making shakings. These channels have a 
conserved motif in the pore region with the sequence GYG (Nieves-
Cordones and Gaillard 2014, page e972892) and a MPM structure 
(Membrane-Pore-Membrane) (Figure 8.20A). Some shaker channels are 
tetramers and the channel is formed by four inner transmembrane helices. 
A few shaker channels have the four MPM structures in the same 
polypeptide. The specificity of K+ channels (that cannot transport Na+) is 
based on the size of the cations (Figure 8.20B). In water solution K+ and 
Na+ are hydrated by four water molecules and in the case of K+ these four 
water molecules are replaced by four carbonyl groups of the pore region. 
However, the smaller Na+ cannot fit and binds only two carbonyls of the 
pore. Therefore, this cation is more stable bound to water than to the pore 
and is not transported. 
 
Figure 8.21 illustrates the differences between channels and transporters 
(symporters, antiporters and uniporters or facilitated diffusions). In the 
channels a single binding site is accessible from both sides of the 
membrane and there are no conformational changes of the protein. The 
turnover is very high (106-108 sec-1). In the transporters the protein makes 
a conformational change to alternate binding sites for the transported 
molecule from both sides of the membrane and the turnover is very low 
(from 1 to 100 sec-1).

Channels are regulated by conformational changes of a “gate” controlled 
by membrane potential, ligand binding or phosphorylation (Figure 8.22). 
A gate is a barrier for movement of the molecules across the channel.

8.6. Antiporters, symporters and uniporters or facilitated 
diffusion  
Antiporters couple the movement of one molecule in one direction to the 
movement of another molecule in the reverse direction (see Figure 8.23 
left). On the other hand, symporters couple the movement of H+ or Na+ 
with that of another molecule in the same direction (see Figure 8.23 right).

Figure 8.23. Mechanism of antiporters (left) and symporters (right). 
 
Uniporters or facilitated diffusion proteins transport a single molecule 
across membranes. Channels are another kind of uniports. Antiporters, 
symporters and uniporters can be regulated by phosphorylation. 
 
There are some indirect ways of transport. For example, bicarbonate 
uptake in symport with Na+ is equivalent to proton efflux as indicated in 
Figure 8.24 (Casey, Grinstein and Orlowski 2009, page 50). Also, 
ammonium uptake results in proton uptake (Figure 8.25). The pKa of 
ammonia is §9 and the protonated form is taken by cells. Inside the cells 
ammonia gets deprotonated and diffuse out through the hydrophobic 
membrane.

Figure 8.24. How bicarbonate uptake results in proton efflux. 
 
The first pKa of carbonic acid/CO2 is 6.3 (the second is 10.3). The reaction 
is CO2 + H2O <<>>CO3H2 <<>>CO3H- + H+. For the equilibrium between 
CO2 + H2O and CO3H2 to be fast enough the enzyme carbonic anhydrase is 
required. 
 
 
 
Figure 8.25. How uptake of ammonium results in proton uptake. 
8.6. The regulatory cations: Na+, H+, Ca2+ and K+ 
Na+ in general is toxic because it displaces K+ from its binding sites at the 
ribosomes and other essential enzymes. However, Na+ regulates Ca2+ 
concentration by a Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Protons are also toxic by inhibiting 
metabolic reactions and growth. Calcium regulates many proteins after

binding to C2 domains or EF hands. Potassium activates some enzymes 
such as Na+/K+-ATPase and pyruvate kinase. 
 
There is a problem when assigning specific regulatory roles to protons 
(Figure 8.26). 
 
 
 
Figure 8.26. The problem of assigning specific regulatory sites to protons. 
 
Calcium has specific binding sites in C2 domains and EF hands (see 
Chapter 9, Figures 9.12 and 9.15) but protons bind to many sites 
(carboxylates and amino groups) in all proteins, and only some of these 
binding sites will be regulatory. 
 
Only a few specific regulatory sites for protons have been identified, 
including H+ inhibition of phosphofructokinase (Krebs, Wiggins, Stubbs, 
Sols et al. 1983, page 657), H+-gated receptors OGR1 and OGR4 activated 
by extracellular protons (Imenez Silva, Camara and Wagner 2022, page 
C400) and the Bax inhibitor-1 activated by intracellular acidification 
(Lebeaupin, Blanc, Vallée, Keller et al. 2020, page 1772).

CHAPTER 9 
BIOCHEMICAL REGULATION BY PROTEINS 
 
 
 
9.1. The regulatory work of proteins 
As mentioned in Chapter 5, protein nano-machineries perform four kinds 
of work in cells: chemical (enzymes), mechanical (nano-motors), transport 
across membranes (membrane transporters) and regulatory (regulatory 
proteins), the latter being the subject of the present chapter. Of course, 
some proteins perform less sophisticated work, such as having structural 
roles in cells and organisms and storing nitrogen for biosynthesis of new 
molecules. But regulatory proteins are the most important because they 
take care of crucial processes for Medicine and Agriculture, such as 
growth and proliferation of cells (important for cancer and crop yields), 
responses to environmental conditions (stress adaptations in animals and 
plants, survival and crop yields) and development of higher organisms 
(differentiation of tissues and organs). 
 
As previously shown in Figure 5.6, every enzyme is a potential regulatory 
protein because during its catalytic cycle it can experience at least three 
conformations (Figure 9.1). 
 
 
 
Figure 9.1. Every enzyme is a potential regulator because it exists as (at least) three 
different conformations during its catalytic cycle: free enzyme (E), enzyme bound 
to substrate (ES) and enzyme bound to product of the reaction (EP).

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
137 
The regulatory work of proteins in cells can be assimilated to the 
bureaucracy of our human world. It seems unimportant but actually 
controls all the activities needed to avoid “problems” such as cell growth 
when it is not needed or biosynthesis of substances outside of the required 
time. The importance of regulation is such that most cellular proteins are 
regulatory and take care of controlling all the other working proteins. 
  
Regulatory proteins arrange into signal-transduction circuits that, like 
those in a computer chip (Figure 9.2), transmit information when “on”. We 
will study first the different types of regulatory proteins and later a few 
illustrative circuits. Signal transduction is the change of one signal into 
another in the circuits of regulation. 
 
 
Figure 9.2. A computer chip. Courtesy of unsplas.com. 
9.2. Protein kinases and phosphatases 
Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins in serines, 
threonines or tyrosines side chains to regulate their activity (activation or 
inhibition) and protein phosphatases hydrolyze the phosphate esters to 
revert the state of the proteins (Figure 9.3). Protein kinases are activated 
by ligand binding (membrane receptors or second messengers, see below) 
or by phosphorylation by other protein kinases in the so-called “activation 
loop”, a loop in the structure that blocks the access of substrates to the 
active site and is removed by a conformational change induced by 
phosphorylation within it. Phosphorylation of proteins is involved in the 
brain memory of animals. 
 

Chapter 9 
 
138
 
 
Figure 9.3. Changes in conformation of proteins by phosphorylation and 
dephosphorylation. 
9.3. G proteins 
G proteins are regulatory proteins that bind GTP or GDP. In the first case 
they are active and regulate other proteins (Figure 9.4). 
 
. 
 
Figure 9.4. Regulation of G proteins. 
 
 
 

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
139 
G proteins may have an endogenous GTPase activity (GTP + H2O >>> 
GDP + Pi) but in many cases this is increased by GTPase Activating 
Proteins (abbreviated as GAPs). Activation of G proteins occurs by 
GTPase Exchange Factors (abbreviated as GEFs). By opening the active 
site, cytosolic GTP replaces GDP because the concentration in the cytosol 
of GTP is much greater than that of GDP. GAPs and GEFs can be 
regulated by membrane receptors or by second messengers (see below). 
 
There are two kinds of G proteins: trimeric G proteins and monomeric or 
small G proteins. Trimeric G proteins have a subunit that binds GTP or 
GDP (Dsubunit) and two regulatory subunits (E and J) that block the 
active site and prevent activation by nucleotide exchange.  
9.4. Second messengers  
Second messengers are regulatory molecules induced by activated surface 
receptors bound to hormones (Figure 9.5). 
 
                   
 
 
Figure 9.5. Some important second messengers. Courtesy of researchgate.net 
(cGMP and cAMP), es.wikipedia.org (IP3) and shutterstock.com (DAG). 
 
Calcium refers to free calcium because most calcium in cells is bound to 
the surface of lipid membranes. Intracellular and extracellular pH (H+ 
concentration inside and outside cells) is a novel second messenger that 
has received little attention previously but appears now as a very important 

Chapter 9

signal for growth and stress tolerance (see Chapters 10-12). Cyclic AMP 
(cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) are produced by adenylate cyclase and 
guanylate cyclase, respectively. These enzymes have the nucleotide 
triphosphates ATP or GTP as substrates and work by a nucleophilic attack 
of the 3’ OH of the ribose to the Jphosphate with liberation of 
pyrophosphate (PPi). See Figure 9.6. 
 
 
 
Figure 9.6. The reaction of adenylate or guanylate cyclases. Courtesy of 
researchgate.net. 
 
Other second messengers are:  
 
(a)  Adenosine triphosphate or ATP, its levels signal the energy status 
of the cells.  
(b) Special metabolites such as phosphorylated sugars (signals the 
carbon status of the cells) and 2-oxo-glutarate, an intermediate of 
the tricarboxylic acid cycle and carbon skeleton for nitrogen-
assimilatory reactions (signals carbon and nitrogen availability 
through 2-oxoglutarate-sensing regulatory proteins). 
(c)  Iron-sulfide clusters composed of iron and inorganic sulfide with 
different stoichiometries and that regulate iron homeostasis.  
(d) Denatured proteins, which signal stress conditions.  
(e)  Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2), which is the most stable ROS. These regulate growth and 
death of cells and participate in defenses against pathogens.  
(f)  Membrane electrical potential ('<), which controls the activity of 
many membrane proteins in a similar manner to cell turgor and 
membrane lipid fluidity. 

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
141 
9.5. Regulatory exterior signals 
Outside cells the most important signals are light, water potential, 
temperature, toxic molecules, nutrients, pathogens, cell contacts and 
hormones. All have specific receptors.  
Transduction of external signal proceeds in three steps (Figure 9.7). 
 
 
 
Figure 9.7. The three steps of signal transduction. 
 
First the signal is perceived by a receptor, then the signal is converted into 
a second messenger that amplifies the signal and finally there is a response 
that could be transcriptional (gene expression) or non-transcriptional 
(regulation of a protein). The second one is faster. 
9.6. Receptors of hormones and growth factors 
One important family of membrane receptors has seven transmembrane 
helices and are abbreviated as “7TM” and respond to a variety of external 
signals such as light, hormones and tasty molecules. 7TM receptors 
participate in hormone actions, neurotransmission, development, vision, 
smell, taste and pathogen infections. An example is shown in Figure 9.8 
with the structure of rhodopsin. 
 
Rhodopsin is a protein in mammalian retina with covalently bound 11-cis-
retinal to lysine 296. Upon light absorption it changes to 11-trans retinal 
(Figure 9.9).

absorption. Courtesy of researchgate.net. 
 
An example of a receptor and signal transduction pathway is the hormone 
epinephrine, also called adrenaline (Figure 9.10). 
 
When the hormone binds to its E-adrenergic receptor from outside the cell 
a conformational change occurs at the intracellular protruding domain of 
the receptor, which is bound to a heterotrimeric G-protein. This 
conformational change releases the E and J subunits and converts the 
intracellular domain into a G protein exchange factor or GEF. The activated 
D subunit is released from the receptor and binds to the membrane enzyme 

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
143 
adenylate cyclase that converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). This 
second messenger activates a protein kinase named protein kinase A 
(sometimes abbreviated as PKA). See Figure 9.10. 
 
 
 
Figure 9.10. The signal transduction pathway of epinephrine (adrenaline). 
 
There is amplification of the signal at several steps of this signal 
transduction pathway: (a) one hormone-bound receptor can activate many 
molecules of heterotrimeric G-protein; (b) one activated D-subunit of the 
heterotrimeric G-protein can activate many molecules of adenylate 
cyclase; (c) one molecule of adenylate cyclase can produce many 
molecules of cAMP to activate many molecules of protein kinase A. 
 
The epinephrine signal is stopped by different mechanisms: (a) the binding 
of the hormone to its receptor is reversible and therefore when the 
concentration of the hormone in blood decreases the receptor dissociates  
the hormone and becomes inactive, (b) the GD dissociated subunit has 
some GTPase activity (without GAP proteins) and when converted into the 
GDP form re-associates with theE and J subunits, and (c) the enzyme 
called “E-adrenergic receptor kinase” is activated by the protein kinase A 
and phosphorylates the receptor, then a protein known as E-arrestin binds 
to the phosphorylated receptor and inhibits the activation of the heterotrimeric 
G protein. 
 

Chapter 9 
 
144
Another important signal transduction pathway in mammals is started by 
the enzyme phospholipase C, which catalyzes the reaction shown in Figure 
9.11 at the plasma membrane. 
 
Phospholipase C (abbreviated as PLC) is activated by G proteins coupled 
to receptors binding many hormones (serotonin, calcitonin, histamine, 
glutamate and others). When activated it catalyzes the conversion of 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (abbreviated as PIP2) to diacylglycerol 
(abbreviated as DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (abbreviated as IP3).  
 
      
 
 
Figure 9.11. Reaction of phospholipase C. The structures are courtesy of 
researchgate.net. 
 
IP3 moves to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and activates a 
Ca2+ channel present in this membrane. This releases Ca2+ at the cytosol 
that binds to the C2 domain of the protein kinase C (abbreviated PKC) and 
the DAG at the plasma membrane binds to the C1 domains of PKC. Both 
events cooperate to activate PKC (Figure 9.12).  
 
Intracellular free calcium has multiple regulatory roles by binding to 
proteins containing EF hands or C2 domains. It can be detected by 
fluorescent compounds such as Indo-1 (Figure 9.13).  Calcium binds to 6-
8 oxygen atoms in proteins. The oxygen in proteins can be H2O, carbonyl 
groups of the main chain and carboxylic acids of the side chain of 
glutamate or aspartate (Figure 9.14). 
 

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
145 
 
 
Figure 9.12. The signal transduction pathway of PLC and PKC. 
 
There are two types of domains that bind calcium: C2 domains like in 
protein kinase C and EF hands like in calmodulin (Figure 9.15).

In the EF hand there is the end of an D-helix, a loop, the beginning of a E-
sheet and the beginning of an D-helix. &DOPRGXOLQ binds to enzymes and 
activates them; for example, calmodulin dependent kinase I (abbreviated 
as CaM kinase I, Figure 9.16). Calmodulin experiences a conformational 
change upon binding calcium and also upon binding to CaM kinase I. 
Upon binding calcium-calmodulin the kinase experiences a big 
conformational change and becomes active (Figure 9.16).

calmodulin when bound to an D-helix of calmodulin dependent kinase (Courtesy of 
researchgate.net) (D): ribbon structure of CaM kinase I (Courtesy of 
jkweb.berkeley.edu). 
 
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is another example of a 
receptor (Figure 9.17). It exists as two monomers that are linked by 
binding to EGF. A signal is then transmitted though the membrane that 
activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor to make cross-
phosphorylation of the two monomers at tyrosine residues. Then a protein, 
Grb2, with SH2 domains (Src homologous domains 2), binds to the 
phospho-tyrosines and experiences a conformational change. This active 
conformation interacts with the intermediate protein Sos, which then acts 
as a GEF (GTPase Exchange Factor) to activate the small, monomeric G 
protein Ras. Ras then activates a MAPK protein kinase cascade, where 
Ras activates protein kinase Raf (a MAPK, from Mitogen Activated 
Protein Kinase), Raf activates protein kinase MEK (a MAPKK, from 
MAPK Kinase), and MEK activates protein kinase ERK (a MAPKKK, 
from MAPKK Kinase), which phosphorylates and activates transcription 
factors and produces a change in gene expression that results in cell 
growth. 
 
This signal transduction pathway is ended by specific protein phosphatases 
(acting on phosphorylated threonines, serines and tyrosines). In addition, 
small monomeric G proteins have a GTP hydrolyzing activity that can be 
increased by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).  
 
 

Chapter 9 
 
148
 
 
Figure 9.17. The signal transduction pathway of the epidermal growth factor (EGF). 
 
There are specific receptors for smell and taste (Figure 9.18) and there are 
some important differences in the perception of these two signals.  
 
 
 
Figure 9.18. Differences in the perception of smell and bitter taste. 

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
149 
In the case of smell, sensory neurons express a single gene of smell 
receptor and the nervous impulses generated by those expressing the same 
gene converge at the same point of the brain. Accordingly, there are many 
different smells. In the case of specific tastes (bitter taste in the figure), all 
different genes for receptors are expressed in all cells and converge at the 
same point of the brain and therefore there is a single bitter taste. There are 
§ 100 sensory neurons and § 200 genes for olfactory receptors in humans. 
Animals have many more. 
 
In the case of taste there are five primary tastes: sweet, salty, umami, bitter 
and sour, and different receptors bind very different molecules with the 
same taste result (Figure 9.19); for instance, glucose, aspartame, saccharin 
and sucralose.

molecules with the same taste result. The structures of glucose, glutamate, quinine, 
aspartame, saccharin, sucralose and naringin are courtesy of bartheby.com, 
researgate.net, MedChemExpress, researchgate.net, en.wikipedia.org, infinitylearn.com 
and en.wikipedia.org, respectively. 
 
Interestingly, some chemicals produce sensations of high (capsaicin) or 
low (menthol) temperatures (Figure 9.20). 
 

Chapter 9 
 
150
 
 
Figure 9.20. Capsaicin in the mouth produces hot sensation and menthol produces 
cold sensation. Structures are courtesy of researchgate.net. 
 
The mechanism of signal transduction is the same in the perception of 
smells and tastes (see Figure 9.21 for the case of a taste molecule).  
 
 
 
Figure 9.21. Mechanism of signal transduction in perception of different taste 
molecules. 
 
The molecules of the different tastes bind to a specific 7-transmembrane 
receptor, the signal of the conformational change is transferred across the 
plasma membrane of the neurons, and as in the case of the adrenaline 
(epinephrine) receptor, a trimeric G protein is activated by releasing E and J 
subunits and up-regulates the activity of adenylate cyclase. At variance with 
the case of adrenaline, the cAMP activates a cAMP-gated channel specific 
for Na+ and Ca2+, which enter the cells and depolarize the plasma membrane. 
This is the beginning of an action potential (see Figures 9.22, 9.26 and 9.27). 

Biochemical Regulation by Proteins 
151 
 
Figure 9.22. An action potential triggered by a taste molecule opening Na+ and 
Ca2+ channels.  
 
As indicated in Figure 9.22, two cation channels activated by 
depolarization are involved in an action potential: a sodium channel and a 
potassium channel. The sodium channel is activated faster and the entry of 
the sodium cation produces a depolarization of the plasma membrane 
nearby. This activates more sodium channels nearby and the process 
results in very fast transmission of the signal (100 meters per second). The 
potassium channel is activated more slowly and the exit of potassium 
results in repolarization. 
 
Salty and sour tastes are detected directly by passage through Na+ and H+ 
entry channels. This causes the initial depolarization that triggers the 
action potential.  
 
There are three kinds of plasma membrane receptors: coupled to tyrosine 
kinase activity, coupled to G proteins and coupled to cation channels. 
 
The perception of hot and cold occurs through cation channels of the TRP 
family permeable to sodium and calcium, thereby triggering depolarization 
and action potentials. TRP1 is activated by high temperature, acidic pH 
and by the compound capsaicin of cayenne peppers (Figure 9.23). TRP8 is 
activated by low temperature and by the compound menthol of the oils of 
corn mint (Figure 9.23).

The transmission of the nervous impulse occurs by the opening and 
closing of two cation channels in the neurons: depolarization by the fast 
activated Na+ entry channel (uptake of Na+ positives charges depolarize 
the membrane) and repolarization by the slowly activated K+ exit channel 
(efflux of K+ positive charges repolarize the membrane). See Figures 9.26 
and 9.27.

GROWTH CONTROL IN CELLS AND CANCER 
 
 
 
10.1. The three stages of growth and proliferation control 
We can distinguish between three stages in the development of growth 
control in cells (Figure 10.1). 
 
 
 
Figure 10.1. The three development stages of growth control. 
 
Primitive cells simply grew when nutrients were available. Present-day 
microorganisms and eukaryotic cells have developed the so-called “Pre-
exhaustion regulation”. This implies that growth only starts when enough 
nutrients are available to complete a cell’s growth and division cycle. The 

Growth Control in Cells and Cancer 
155 
reason is to prevent unfinished cellular activities when nutrients are 
exhausted because incomplete proteins and nucleic acids are toxic to the 
cells. The pre-exhaustion regulation corresponds to the “Start point” or G0 
to G1 transition of the cell cycle and the regulation by growth factors 
(peptide hormones inducing growth) and cell contacts correspond to the 
“Restriction point” of the cell cycle (Figure 10.2).  
10.2. Markers for growing state and ion homeostasis 
The growing state of cells is characterized by different types of markers: 
 
(a) Metabolic: high nutrients in media, high intracellular ATP (energy 
status) and high metabolic intermediates.   
(b) Oxidative: low amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
superoxide anion (O2.-) and oxygenated water (H2O2).  
(c) Membranes state: proper turgor for cell expansion and proper 
fluidity for membrane stability and membrane protein activity. 
(d) Development of higher organisms: growth factors. 
(e) Ion homeostasis: high intracellular pH (pHi), high intracellular 
potassium (K+i), low intracellular free calcium (Ca2+i) and low 
intracellular sodium (Na+i).

The wiring of signal transduction includes external signals (nutrients and 
growth factors), plasma membrane receptors, protein kinases and 
phosphatases, G proteins, transcription factors and chromatin remodeling. 
Mutations of any of these components of growth regulatory pathways can 
produce cancer and the genes are then called “oncogenes” (Figure 10.3). 
 
 
Figure 10.3. Scheme of the signal transduction pathways for the regulation of cell 
growth. At the end of these regulatory pathways with biochemical and biophysical 
components are the TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) protein kinase, the unstable 
proteins known as “cyclins” and the Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs). Cyclins 
drive the different phases of the cell cycle and those involved in the G0ÆG1 
transition are the most important to initiate cell proliferation. Biochemical 
elements in green and biophysical elements in blue. Final effectors in brown. 
 
An example of the complexities of the signal transduction pathways is 
shown in Figure 10.4.

I heard a lecture by Bob (Robert A.) Weinberg at the Whitehead Institute 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Boston, USA) where 
he said, in front of a slide similar to Figure 10.4, that one friend of him 
spent all his life in a little corner of the big scheme. 
10.3. The hallmarks of cancer 
 Robert A. Weinberg, author of the best book on cancer (Weinberg, 2014, 
pages 1-876), pointed to five hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg 
2000, page 57): 
 
(a) Unregulated cell growth and division, independent of growth 
factors and contact inhibition. 
(b) Resistance to apoptosis. 
(c) Immortality. 
(d) Angiogenesis. 
(e) Cancer-related inflammation. 
 
The scheme followed by Weinberg was: Growth factor Æ Receptor Æ PK 
(protein kinase) cascade Æ TFs (transcription factors) Æcancer. 

Chapter 10 
 
158
However, he had no interest in the final effectors of this regulatory 
scheme, no interest in metabolic alterations such as the Warburg effect 
(Warburg, Wind and Negelein, 1927, page 519) and no interest in ion 
homeostasis mechanisms, especially H+ (pH) homeostasis. Therefore 
Weinberg’s list is missing several important hallmarks: 
 
(f) The Warburg effect (see above), consisting of decreased 
respiration, because of poor blood irrigation, and increased lactic 
acid fermentation.  
(g) Metastasis, the only hallmark specific to malignant tumors 
(Lazebnik 2010, page 232). 
(h) Altered pH homeostasis and reversed pH gradient (Cardone, 
Casayola and Reshkin 2005, pages 786-795 and Casey, Grinstein 
and Orlowski 2009, page 50). This is discussed below. 
10.4 pH homeostasis and cancer 
Intracellular pH is a crucial parameter for all organisms (Figure 10.5).  
 
 
 
Figure 10.5. The multiple roles of intracellular pH. 
  
Some organisms like fungi and plants have a proton pumping P-ATPase at 
the plasma membrane (H+ chemiosmotic circuit). Others such as animals 
have a Na+/K+-ATPase (Na+ chemiosmotic circuit). See Chapter 8, Figure 
8.2. 
 

Growth Control in Cells and Cancer 
159 
Most of the signal transduction pathways we have studied in Chapter 9 can 
be classified as “biochemical”, while the action potentials of neurons and 
the regulation by intracellular free calcium (Ca2+i) and intracellular pH 
(pHi) can be classified as “biophysical”.  
 
In normal mammalian cells the intracellular pH is § 7.1 and the 
extracellular pH is § 7.4. In tumor cells the intracellular pH is increased to 
7.4-7.6 while the extracellular pH is decreased to 6.4-6.8. Therefore, there 
is a reversed pH gradient inside and outside the cells. The reversed 
gradient of pH in tumor cells (see above) is obtained as indicated in Figure 
10.6. Because of the reduced blood irrigation of tumors, they receive very 
little oxygen and have decreased respiration. They must change to lactic 
acid fermentation and extrude protons by lactate-H+ symport and Na+-
bicarbonate symport, as described in Chapter 8, Figure 8.16. 
 
 
 
Figure 10.6. How the reversed pH gradient of tumor cells is made. 
 
The major proton transporters in animal cells are described in Figure 10.7 
(Casey, Grinstein and Reshkin 2005, page 50).

Figure 10.7. Proton transport in animal cells. 
 
The Na+/H+ antiporters (NHE), the most important being the isoform 2 
(NHE2), are at the top-left of Figure 10.7. At the top-right there is the Cl-
/HCO3- antiport, which expels protons by introducing bicarbonate into the 
cells (see Chapter 8, Figure 8.16). At the left we have the plasma 
membrane Na+/K+-ATPase that creates a Na+ gradient with higher 
concentrations outside than inside the cells. This is required for the NHE 
antiporters. At the bottom-right corner we have the plasma membrane 
Ca2+/H+ ATPase that expels calcium and introduce protons into the cells. 
The Na+/HCO3- symporter NBC extrudes protons by bicarbonate uptake as 
described in Chapter 8, Figure 8.1. The Na+ dependent HCO3- antiporter 
(NDCBE) and the anion antiporter (AE) that exchange Cl- outside with 
HCO3- inside the cells are also important. The lower part reflects the 
respiration pathway that produces CO2 and, by hydration, H+ and HCO3-. 
Carbonic anhydrases (catalyzing the reaction CO2 + H2O Æ H+ + HCO3-) are 
required for the latter reaction to be fast enough. Also important is the lactic 
fermentation pathway with lactate dehydrogenase, which produces lactate- 
(Figure 10.8) and H+ that are extruded from the cells by a H+/lactate- symport.

Intracellular pH may have both permissive and regulatory roles in cellular 
regulation (Figure 10.9).  
 
 
 
Figure 10.9. The two roles of intracellular pH in cells. 
 
Permissive means that proteins have an optimum pH for activity and 
therefore intracellular pH should be adequate for this requirement of the 
active sites. Regulatory means that intracellular pH regulates the activity 
of a protein at a site different from the active site of the protein. However, 
one can think that a permissive action is also regulatory. 
 
The main questions on the connection between intracellular pH and cancer 
are: (a) is the altered pH of tumors a cause or consequence of the 
malignant transformation? (b) how is this altered pH achieved? and (c) in 
the case it is regulatory, how does it drive growth?. The path of progress 
for scientific research in Biology is the use of model systems. A list of 
model systems is shown in Figure 10.10. 
 
The author of this book has worked with baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) (Portillo and Serrano 1989, page 501), 3T3 mouse fibroblast 
(Perona and Serrano 1988, page 438) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Alejandro, 
Rodriguez, Bellés, Yenush et al. 2007, page 3203). 
 
An example of using yeast to study the connection between intracellular 
pH and cell growth is shown in Table 10.1. Clearly, there is a correlation 
between intracellular pH and growth rate.

10.5. Doxorubicin and the pH gradient 
Doxorubicin, most often sold under the commercial name of “Adriamycin”, is 
one of the most important chemotherapy drugs (Figure 10.12). 
 
 
 
Figure 10.12. Structure of doxorubicin. Courtesy of Wikipedia. 

Growth Control in Cells and Cancer 
163 
Doxorubicin is a base with pKa = 8.2 (Webb, Chimenti, Jacobson and 
Barber 2011, page 671) and its protonation outside the cells is much 
greater in cancer cells (extracellular pH § 6.9) then in normal cells 
(extracellular pH § 7.4). The non-protonated form, without electric charge, 
equilibrates at both sides of the membrane by diffusion or, if relatively 
polar, through porins. 
 
Figure 10.13. The distribution of doxorubicin at both sides of the plasma membrane 
in normal and in cancer cells. DH+ is the protonated form of doxorubicin and D the 
non-protonated neutral form. 
 
Surprisingly, this chemotherapeutic drug accumulates much more in 
normal cells than in cancer cells and this explains the many side effects of 
doxorubicin in normal tissues. 
10.6. How to conquer cancer 
It is important to remark how cancer will be defeated. In a book by 
Herbert G. Wells (Wells, 1927, page 44) there is a very illuminating 
conversation between a scientist (Mr Sempack) and a politician (Lord 
Tamar) that pinpoint the importance of basic research driven by scientific 
curiosity to solve practical problems: 
 
Mr. Sempack:  
The disease of cancer will be banished from life by calm, unhurrying, 
persistent men and women, working with every shiver of feeling controlled 
and suppressed, in hospitals and laboratories. And the motive that will 
conquer cancer will not be pity nor horror, it will be curiosity to know how 
and why. 
 
Lord Tamar: 
And the desire for service! 

Chapter 10 
 
164
Mr. Sempack: 
As the justification of that curiosity, but not as the motive. Pity never made 
a good doctor, love never made a good poet. Desire for service never made 
a discovery.  
 
This is reflected in the discovery of antibiotics by A. Fleming, of 
restriction enzymes by H.O. Smith and D. Nathans, of transgenic plants by 
M. Van Montagu and J. Shell and by the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 
system by F.J. Mojica. 
10.7. Metastasis 
One important problem of cancer is metastasis, the exit of cells from a 
primary tumor to establish new tumors in different organs of the body. In a 
publication of Robert J. Gillies’ group (Robey, Bagget, Kirkpatrick, 
Dosescu et al. 2009, page 2260), it was shown that sodium bicarbonate 
supplemented to the food of mice, by increasing the extracellular pH, 
greatly reduced metastasis. The mechanism is that metastasis of a primary 
tumor involves secretion of lysosomal proteases with acidic optimal pH to 
destroy the extracellular matrixes that keep enclosed cells from the tumors. 
Therefore, increasing the extracellular pH of tumors from its normal value 
of about 7.0 to 7.4 (measured by 31P magnetic resonance) reduces metastasis. 
The equivalent dose for humans will be 12.5 grams per day of sodium 
bicarbonate, something that was considered in the past as a healthy 
routine. 
 
As bicarbonate has sodium as a counter ion and this may have potential 
undesirable health effects, Robert J. Gillies’ group developed an alternative 
base: the famous laboratory base tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane 
(abbreviated as Tris). A Tris base buffer at pH 8.4 had no toxicity to mice 
and effectively inhibited metastasis at a concentration in the drinking 
water of mice of 0.2 M (Ibrahim-Hashim, Abrahams, Enriquez-Navas, 
Luddy et al., 2017, page 1720). 
10.8. Inhibition of pH regulation 
Another approach to cancer therapy is the inhibition of proton transport 
(Meehan, Wars, Turnbull, Bukovski et al. 2017, page 42857 and McIntyre, 
Hulikova, Ledaki, Snell et al. 2016, page 3744). One feature of tumor 
hypoxia is the activated expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9). This 
is important for H+ efflux by the mechanism described in Chapter 8, 

Growth Control in Cells and Cancer 
165 
Figure 8.16. Basically, bicarbonate uptake results in proton efflux but for 
maximal speed carbonic anhydrase is needed to accelerate the equilibrium 
CO2 + H2O <> CO3H- + H+. This approach involves targeting the pH 
regulatory proteins carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), antiporter H+/Na+ 
(NHE1) and vacuolar rotatory H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which is also 
located at the plasma membrane. The drugs targeting CAIX (S4), NHE1 
(dimethyl amiloride, DMA) and V-ATPase (bafilomycin A1) inhibited 
proliferation of tumor cells in culture. Both NHE1 and CAIX inhibitors 
combine effectively with irradiation to inhibit clonogenic assays of tumor 
cells. The V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 was the most potent 
inhibitor of proliferation of tumor cells. 
10.9. The triggering role of Hypoxia via HIF1 in cancer 
development 
The transcription factor HIF (Hypoxia Induced Factor) is regulated by a 
curious mechanism. Under aerobic conditions HIF is hydroxylated at 
proline residues by oxygen-dependent hydroxylases. This modification 
triggers ubiquitination by ubiquitin ligase pVHL (Von Hippel-Lindau 
protein) and then it is degraded by the proteasome. Under anaerobic 
conditions hydroxylation is inhibited and HIF is protected. Then this 
transcription factor induces genes related to glycolysis, pentose-phosphate 
pathway, angiogenesis for oxygen supply, H+ and lactate- efflux transporters, 
metastasis, antioxidants and growth and proliferation. 
10.10. Inhibition of bicarbonate transport 
Adrian L. Harris’ group (see reference in section 10.8 above) from the 
University of Oxford, Molecular Oncology Laboratories, Department of 
Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe 
Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom, has shown that the disruption 
of two genes encoding bicarbonate transporters (SCL4A4 or SCL4A9) by 
either genetic or pharmaceutical approaches result in acidified intracellular 
pH and inhibition of tumor cell growth. Also, RNA interference (RNAi) 
mediated attenuation of SCL4A9 induced apoptosis (regulated cell death) 
in breast cancer spheroids and reduced growth in several tumor cell lines. 
It is concluded that “disrupting pH homeostasis by blocking bicarbonate 
import might broadly relieve the common resistance of hypoxic tumors to 
anticancer therapy”. 

Chapter 10

10.11. A promising approach to specifically inhibit growth 
of cancer cells 
The author of this book has developed a novel approach to specifically 
inhibit the growth of tumor cells that is summarized in Figure 10.14. 
Cancer cells have a reversed pH gradient as we have discussed in section 
10.4 of this chapter. A weak organic acid such as 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-
dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (abbreviated as DMO, Figure 10.15) with 
pKa 6.2 can be accumulated in tumor cells (more alkaline inside) but is 
excluded in normal cells (more alkaline outside). This accumulation in 
cancer cells will be accompanied by proton uptake and a decrease of 
intracellular pH. The proton extrusion systems of the cancer cell will be 
activated and ATP depletion is expected. Either the lowering of 
intracellular pH or the depletion of ATP to extrude protons or both will 
cause inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. Other methods to induce 
intracellular acidification such as the addition of proton ionophores (for 
instance CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) would be 
toxic because they act on all cellular membranes and inhibit oxidative 
phosphorylation, the secretory pathway and lysosomal activities.

DMO is used to treat schizophrenia and therefore it is a well-known drug, 
ready to be used in cancer patients. The main problem with this approach 
is that most medical doctors and scientists working on cancer do not 
understand the tricks of proton homeostasis and think that it is too simple 
to be true. But it really should work and these negative people should 
study proton homeostasis before giving their negative opinions that 
probably are delaying a general treatment of cancer. 
 
A further step would be to modify non-selective toxic drugs (such as 
rapamycin) by adding to their structure an acidic group with pKa 6.2-6.5 
in parts of the molecule that are not needed for their toxicity. For example, 
the compound 2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid has a pKa of 6.2 and 
when coupled to another molecule without acid/base groups it will favor 
its preferential accumulation in cancer cells. These derivatives would 
accumulate much more in cancer cells than in control cells and therefore 
exhibit selective toxicity.

CHAPTER 11 
THE TOLERANCE OF PLANTS TO ABIOTIC 
STRESSES 
 
 
 
11.1. The importance of tolerance of crops  
to abiotic stresses 
An analysis of major US crops shows that there is a large genetic potential 
for yield that is unrealized because of the need for better adaptation of the 
plants to the environments in which they are grown. Evidence from native 
populations suggests that high productivity can occur in these environments 
and that opportunities for improving production in unfavorable environments 
are substantial. A crucial publication (Boyer 1982, page 443) compares the 
record yields (the year with the greatest harvest of the crop), average yields, 
and average losses caused by bacterial and fungal diseases and by 
unfavorable environments (Table 11.1). Abiotic stress is the major limiting 
factor for agricultural productivity, although biotic stresses such as the potato 
beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), the potato late blight (Phytophtora 
infestants) and the locust plague (Schistocerca gregaria) also cause enormous 
losses. In 1847 a plague of Phytophtora infestans devastated Ireland and 
forced a massive emigration of Irish people to the USA. 
 
Table 11.1. Losses of crop production due to unfavorable environment. Values are 
in Kg per hectare. Losses due to unfavorable environment were calculated as 
follow: record yield minus average yield plus disease loss plus insect loss. Data 
from Boyer 1982. 
 

The Tolerance of Plants to Abiotic Stresses 
171 
Heat, drought and salinity have driven the collapse of civilizations in the 
past and they can do it again (Kerr 1988, page 325 and Weiss and Bradley 
2001, page 609). The climatic changes that have occurred during the 
history of the Indo-European civilization are as follows: 
 
§ 10,000 years Before Christ (B.C.): the last glaciation and the first arid 
period occurred. It stimulated the agricultural revolution because ancient 
humans were forced to abandon the hunting and collecting activities and 
start planting crops and living in cities. 
 
6,400 B.C.: there was a second postglacial period and the ancient people 
who invented agriculture and civilization in Mesopotamia had to emigrate 
to the east (Iran, India) and to the west (Europe, first to Greece, and 
Africa, first to Egypt). 
 
3,100 B.C.: a third arid period occurred and it collapsed the Uruk 
civilization of the sumerians, first at Sumer city and later at Babylon. 
 
2,200 B.C.: a fourth arid period occurred in a global scale and collapsed 
the Akkadian empire in Mesopotamia, the Old Kingdom in Egypt, the 
Harappan civilization in India and the bronze civilization in Crete and 
Greece. 
 
1,700 B.C.: the agricultural fields in the Diyala region (Mesopotamia) 
were salinized making the cultivation of wheat impossible. It was replaced 
by barley (more salt tolerant) but after some time even barley could not 
grow in the fields. A map of the region is shown in Figure 11.1 - left part. 
 
More recently, at about 900 A.D. (Anno Domini, after Christ) the Maya 
civilization, that had existed since 1,800 B.C. in central America at the 
Yucatan peninsula, collapsed and its cities were abandoned because a 
lengthy drought period. 
 
 
Pictures of salinized fields are shown in Figure 11.1 - center and right.

Aral sea in Russia. Bottom: agricultural fields in Lower California (Mexico) before 
(top) and after (bottom) a few decades of intensive irrigation. Pictures provided by 
Prof. Roberto Gaxiola, University of Arizona at Tempe, USA. 
 
The usual cause of salinization is intensive irrigation. The irrigation water 
always has some salt and when the water evaporates the salt concentrates. 
The two lower parts of Figure 11.1 shows this mechanism. The upper 
picture shows a big irrigation channel used to water the fields. The bottom 
image shows the resulting salinization after a few years of cultivation. 
Cultivation is no longer possible at this stage. We may say that drought 
brings irrigation and then irrigation brings salinity. 
 

The Tolerance of Plants to Abiotic Stresses 
173 
It may be concluded that abiotic stresses led to limited agricultural 
production and caused the collapse of civilizations in the past and this may 
also occur in the future. My advice for politicians that administrate 
research funds and that usually prioritize biomedical research is that they 
should increase massively the funding of agricultural research because 
future humans may have very good hospitals, medical doctors and drugs 
but nothing to eat. 
 
Abiotic stress is not only a limiting factor for agricultural productivity, it is 
an ideal probe to investigate basic cellular functions because it impinges 
on the structure and function of crucial biological systems (Figure 11.2). 
 
 
 
Figure 11.2. Studies on abiotic stresses in plants which lead to discoveries in 
different important areas of biological research. 
 
Heat stress studies led to the discovery of protein instability and unfolding 
and also heat-shock proteins or chaperones. Water stress studies led to the 
discovery of the instability of protein and membrane structures and the 
discovery of osmolytes and LEA proteins (hydrophilins). Salt stress 
studies have shed light on ion transport and homeostasis.

11.2. The physiology and biochemistry of abiotic stress 
Physiological correlations and biochemical (in vitro) assays have provided 
putative crucial phenomena in abiotic stress tolerance, and a list of the 
crucial phenomena in abiotic stress tolerance that proved to be relevant to 
genetic modification of the corresponding genes is shown in Table 11.2.

One important aspect for tolerance to drought stress is the closing of 
stomata. This plant specialized structure has two guard cells surrounding a 
pore for entry of CO2 in photosynthesis and the exit of water vapor. As 
indicated in Figure 11.3, the stomata close when the guard cells are flaccid 
(shrunken) and open when they are turgid (swollen).

and ions though membranes and through xylem and phloem vessels. Xylem moves 
water and other molecular from roots to aerial part and phloem does the same in 
the opposite direction.        
 
The crucial phenomena for abiotic stress tolerance that proved to be 
relevant by genetic modification are (see Figure 11.4): 
 
a) In osmotic and heat/cold stress tolerance: 
 
1) stomata regulation and ABA (abscisic acid as stress hormone) 
 
2) osmolytes 
 
3) LEA proteins (Late Embryogenesis Abundant) 
 
4) HSP proteins (Heat Schock Proteins, chaperones) 
 
5) antioxidants 
 
6) cellular toxicity targets (proteins, membranes) 
 
 
b) In salt toxicity tolerance: 
 
1) uptake, efflux, compartmentation of salt 
 
2) xylem and phloem transport of salt  
 
3) cellular toxicity targets (proteins, membranes) of salt. 
 
The molecular biology of abiotic stress in plants allows us to make 
correlations between genes (and encoded proteins) and their corresponding 
functions in tolerance to abiotic stress (Figure 11.5). 
 

Chapter 11 
 
176
There are two kinds of approaches: (a) forward genetics, from plant 
mutants (selected by the screening of mutant collections) to isolation of 
the responsible genes; (b) reversed genetics, from genes to mutants by 
generating transgenic organisms with gain and loss of function with 
known genes. 
 
Concerning genomic approaches, we must distinguish between “Expression 
Genomics” and “Mutant Genomics”. I consider the latter the “True 
Functional Genomics” (Figure 11.6). The rationale for Expression 
Genomics is that if regulation of a gene expression has been selected by 
evolution up to the present time it must be useful. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11.5. The molecular biology of abiotic stress. Correlations between genes 
(and proteins) with cellular functions. 
 
But there is a caveat: living organisms are not so simple and exhibit 
responses that are without apparent usefulness, perhaps waiting for a 
future use, not at present time. In Mutant Genomics you screen collections 
of mutants made by chemical mutagenesis (gain or loss of function) or by 
activation tagging.

11.4. The usefulness of biodiversity 
Biodiversity is very useful in stress studies. There are two higher plant 
systems with great drought stress tolerance: orthodox seeds and resurrection 
plants (Figure 11.7). 
 
 
 
Figure 11.7. Corn seeds are very tolerant to drought stress (A) and resurrection 
plants (Miraculus sight) recover after complete desiccation (B). Courtesy of 
shutterstock (A) and alamy.com (B). 
 
The question we must ask to explain tolerance of these systems is: do 
resurrection plants and seeds have more and/or better defenses against 
water stress than vegetative tissues of normal plants? In any case, genes 
specific to these systems need to be tested by expression in transgenic crop 
plants. 
 
Another tool of biodiversity is Genome Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS). You need many sequenced genomes of different cultivars from 
the same species. Then you determine the drought tolerance of all of them 
and establish correlations with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs, 
changes of one nucleotide in different cultivars) (see Renard et al. 2020, 
page 2523). The results are expressed in Manhattan Plots (Figure 11.9). 
The upper horizontal line points to the statistical limit of significance and 
the points with different colors (depending on the chromosome) correspond 
to SNPs. Those above the significance level must be checked by testing 
mutants with loss of function: if drought tolerance is increased the gene of 
the SNP was negative for the phenotype and if drought tolerance was 
decreased the gene was positive (Korte and Farlow 2013). In a recent 
publication, the author of this book used this GWAS strategy to study seed

longevity: the loss-of-function of 20 candidate genes was obtained, with 
seven genes positive for this phenotype and five negative.

11.5. Cold, freezing and salt stress 
Cold and freezing cause membrane permeabilization, osmotic stress and 
mechanical damage by ice crystals (Figure 11.10). 
Dehydration causes packing of phospholipids, transition into gel phase and 
membrane damage with increased permeability. Osmolytes and LEA 
proteins maintain the bilayer in the liquid-crystalline state.

Buchanan, Gruissem and Jones, 2015, Figure 22.18. 
 
Salt produces osmotic stress by decreasing water potential outside and 
forcing water to leave the cells. 
 
The molecular damage caused during cellular dehydration includes protein 
denaturation (by loss of the hydration layer of external side chains of polar 
amino acids), membrane damage also by loss of the hydration layer of the 
polar heads of membrane phospholipids (loss of permeability barrier, 
turgor and fluidity) and oxidative damage by increased production of 

The Tolerance of Plants to Abiotic Stresses 
179 
Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS: anion superoxide O2.-, oxygen peroxide 
H2O2 and hydroxyl radical OH.).  The hydration shells of proteins and 
membranes are protected by osmolytes (see Figure 11.11). ROS are 
always produced as side reactions of electron transport chains of 
mitochondria and chloroplasts and stress increases ROS production. ROS 
oxidizes proteins, nucleic acids and membranes. This cause protein 
denaturation and destabilization of membranes. Dehydration causes 
packing of membrane phospholipids, transition from liquid crystalline 
state into gel phase and increased passive permeability (see Chapter 3, 
section 5). 
   
Osmolytes, also known as compatible solutes, are small organic molecules 
accumulated by organisms upon osmotic stress (desiccation) for osmotic 
adjustment to restore turgor. They are chemically compatible with proteins 
and membranes (no carbonyl or amine groups that can react with proteins) 
and stabilize these structures during desiccation and freezing. For 
example, the amino acids acting as osmolytes have an amino group 
blocked by double methylation. Osmolytes also protect against ROS. 
 
Osmolytes have important biotechnological applications, such as the 
preservation of living organisms during desiccation or freezing (needed to 
preserve humans during long space trips!) and the lowering of aging-
causing metabolisms.

in Figure 11.12.

11.6. LEA proteins and chaperones 
LEA proteins receive their name from Late Embryogenesis Abundant (as 
described in section 11.2) and are present in seeds but also in vegetative 
tissues when subjected to osmotic stress. They are small hydrophilic 
proteins with high content of glycine (> 6%). They have a low sequence 
complexity with repeated motifs such as SAKEKIS (in the group of LEA4 
proteins) or AYDKA-AKD (in the group of LEA3 proteins) (see Bies-
Ethève et al. 2008). They protect proteins and membrane like osmolytes. 
LEA proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins and remain soluble upon 
boiling, a feature that facilitates their purification. LEA proteins and 
chaperones (Heat-Shock Proteins) were discussed in Chapter 3. It must be 
indicated that in plants Heat-Shock Factors (HSFs) are activated not only 
by heat but also by high light, drought, ROS and, during seed maturation, 
by development. Also, activated plant HSFs induce the expression of 
antioxidant defenses such as ascorbate peroxidases in addition to 
chaperones and are part of multiple stress resistance (Jacob, Hirt and 
Bendahmane 2017, page 405).

12.1. The goal of the research on intracellular pH 
Intracellular pH (cytosolic pH, pHc) regulates many crucial cellular 
functions and must be tightly controlled by homeostasis. The mechanisms 
of pHc regulation and the targets of high and low pHc are only partially 
known. A high pHc (7.2-7.4) is a universal feature of actively growing 
cells and a low pHc (< 6.5) inhibits cell growth and, if intense enough, 
triggers cell death. 
 
Intracellular acidification is especially relevant for agriculture because it is 
a consequence of many stresses, in the same way as an increase in 
intracellular free calcium and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) (see 
Scheme 12.1). Crucial systems for pHc homeostasis are the biophysical 
pH-stat (H+ uptake and efflux), the biochemical pH-stat (metabolic acid 
production and consumption) and the cellular targets of pHc controlling 
growth.

The basic mechanisms of proton transport in plants are shown in Figure 
12.1. All systems are required but the important ones are those that are 
limiting and this is not always known (see below). 
 
 
 
Figure 12.1. The mechanisms of proton transport in plants (Arabidopsis names). 
 
The most important system for regulation of intracellular pH is the H+-
pumping P-ATPase of the plasma membrane, which has been mostly 
studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Falhof, Pedersen, 
Fuglsang and Palmgren 2016, page 323 and Haruta, Gray and Sussman 
2015, page 68). This pump is regulated by biophysical and biochemical 
systems, as indicated in Scheme 12.2. It must be stated that the protein 
kinases mediating the regulation of the enzyme by low pHc have not been 
identified. These regulatory enzymes phosphorylate the penultimate 
threonine (T947 in Arabidopsis) of the ATPase (see Haruta, Gray and 
Sussman, 2015, page 68). K+ uptake may also be limiting for electrical 
balance during H+ extrusion by the ATPase.

RALF is a peptide hormone. FC is fusicoccin, a substance produced by fungi to 
induce stomata opening and then penetrate into the plants. 
 
Another system controlling intracellular pH is the biochemical pH-stat 
shown in Scheme 12.3. 
 
 
 
Scheme 12.3. The biochemical pH-stat with two crucial enzymes (malic enzyme 
and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. 
 
The biochemical pH-stat is based on carboxylation (alkaline stress) and 
decarboxylation (acid stress) reactions. It was proposed by D.D. Davies 
(1973, pages 513-529). Many cellular systems could modulate growth in 
response to small changes in pH. An example is glycolysis, where 
phosphofructokinase is inhibited at acidic pHc. Protein synthesis and cell 
growth TOR kinase are also inhibited at acidic pHc. However, the cellular 
systems most important for pHc responses and for controlling growth 
remain unknown and genetic approaches are needed to clarify this issue.

12.2. A forward genetic approach with the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana to identify targets and defense 
mechanisms of intracellular acidification 
In order to identify targets of intracellular acidification and defense 
mechanisms we have used a forward genetic approach (Figure 12.2). 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12.2. A forward genetic approach to identify genes important for tolerance 
to intracellular acidification. 
 
There are two strategies to induce intracellular acidification (Figure 12.3). 
One is based on decreasing the pH of the external medium of the plants 
(Iuchi, Koyama, Iuchi, Kobayashi et al. 2007, page 9900) and the other 
utilizes weak organic acids at a pH close to their pKa (§ 5.5) to induce 
intracellular acidification without affecting the external medium (Niñoles, 
Rubio, García-Sánchez, Fernández et al. 2015, page 557). Very low pH in 
the soil solubilizes the toxic aluminum cation and may also have the direct 
effects of an acidic external pH.  
 
It is important to indicate that at the concentrations of acetic acid utilized 
(3-5 mM at external pH of 5.5) there is no cell death, just inhibition of 
growth by intracellular acidification (Figure 12.4).

We used 63,000 lines of Arabidopsis generated by W. Sheible and C. 
Sommerville with T-DNA containing the 35S enhancer, which must be 
coupled to the TATA box of the closest genes (Figure 12.5). This is called 
“activation tagging”. The BASTA genes in the plasmid encode the enzyme 
phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase, which inactivates this herbicide.

The first two mutants tolerant to intracellular acidification, obtained after a 
limited screening of the activation-tagging collection, were wat1-1D (over-
expression of a dominant-negative form of AP-3 Adaptin, see Niñoles, 
Rubio, García-Sanchez, Fernandez et al. 2013, page 557) and rof2-1D 
(over-expression of ROF2 cis-trans prolyl isomerase, see Bissoli, Niñoles, 
Fresquet, Palombieri et al. 2020, page 704). In the first case, a vacuolar K+ 
channel was probably redirected to the plasma membrane because AP-3 is 
required for membrane traffic to the vacuole. In the second case 
intracellular acidification probably induces protein denaturation and ROF2 
is required for re-folding. In both cases the tolerance to intracellular 
acidification correlates with an increased K+ uptake and the depolarization 
of the plasma membrane that increased the activity of the proton pump 
(Figure 12.6). 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12.6. Increased K+ uptake depolarizes the plasma membrane and this 
activates the electrogenic plasma membrane H+-ATPase.

The changes in membrane potential ('<) and intracellular pH in control 
and mutant over-expressing the ROF2 gene are indicated in Table 12.1 
below. In the wild type intracellular acidification triggered by acetic acid 
results in hyperpolarization. In the ROF2 over-expressing mutant, the 
intracellular pH is not affected by acetic acid and the change in membrane 
potential is very small.

After performing an exhaustive screening of the activation-tagging 
collection two new mutants were isolated. Southern analysis (see Bissoli et 
al. 2020) indicated that they correspond to the same insertion of T-DNA. 
The phenotype of tolerance to weak organic acids was very clear (Table

This novel mutant segregates 3:1 in crosses and was named wat2-1D from 
“Weak Acid Tolerant 2, allele 1, Dominant”. 
 
Plasmid rescue (Figure 12.7) makes possible to identify the region of the 
insertion of the T-DNA. By digestion of genomic DNA with one 
restriction enzyme cutting once in the T-DNA (Hind III in this case) and 
with another restriction enzyme that do not cut inside the T-DNA, a linear 
fragment containing a genomic region flanking the insertion is obtained. 
This linear DNA contains the sequence of a plasmid (pUC18 in this case) 
and during a ligation reaction at high dilution, the circularization of the 
DNA will have advantage over the formation of linear concatemers. By 
transformation of competent bacteria and growth, the plasmid multiplied 
and was isolated and sequenced. The sequence of the flanking region in 
the genomic DNA indicated that the 35S enhancer was close to the 
promoter of the gene At5g59120, encoding a protease of the subtilisin 
family called “subtilisin 4.13”, abbreviated “SBT4.13”. See Figure 12.8.

In order to demonstrate that over-expression of SBT4.13 is the cause of 
the tolerance to intracellular acidification we first measured the level of 
expression of the three genes close to the 35S enhancer: SBT.11, SBT.13 
and SBT-like. The results are shown in Table 12.3 below.

In order to exhibit tolerance to intracellular acidification induced by weak 
organic acids the expression of SBT4.13 must be in the range of 85 to 100 
times the level in wild type. Transgenic lines with values below or above 
this range do not exhibit more tolerance to weak organic acids than the 
wild type. 
12.4. Additional phenotypes of the sbt4.13 mutant 
In addition to tolerance to intracellular acidification the sbt4.13 mutant has 
tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and to toxic cations such as lithium (Table

potential negative inside), the lower pHc in the absence and presence of 
acetic acids indicates a lower activity of the proton pump of the plasma 
membrane (H+-ATPase) and this cannot explain the tolerance to 
intracellular acidification. The '<is determined by the activities of the

major ion transporters of the plasma membrane, the H+-ATPases and the 
K+ uptake system (Figure 12.9).                       
 
Figure 12.9. Membrane potential is determined by the activities of major ion 
transporters. Red: H+-ATPase; Blue, K+ uptake systems. 
 
At the intersection there is a balance between H+ efflux and K+ influx and 
this is the cell membrane potential. In the R5 mutant the lower membrane 
potential could be due to lower activity of the H+-ATPase or higher 
activity of the K+ uptake systems. 
 
Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against the plasma membrane 
H+-ATPase indicated that there is less amount of the enzyme protein as 
well as less activity of the enzyme measured in purified plasma membrane 
vesicles. The decrease in H+-ATPase explains the small size of the mutant 
plants. As there is over-expression of a protease such as subtilisin it is 
expected that there may be degradation of proteins. SBT14 is a secreted 
protease and could attack the H+-ATPase in the secretory pathway and 
also after being located at the plasma membrane. 
12.6. How can less H+-ATPase explain acid and oxidation 
tolerance? 
How can we explain the tolerance to intracellular acidification with less 
proton pump? Arabidopsis has two major plasma membrane H+-ATPases: 
AHA1 and AHA2. The aha2-4 mutant, with half the amount of enzymes, 
has similar activity to the sbt4.13-1D mutant. The aha2-4 mutant exhibits 
tolerance to H2O2 but not to acetic acid. Therefore, the sbt4.13-1D mutant 
must have another difference, in addition to less H+-ATPase, to explain 
acid tolerance. At this stage Gaetano Bissoli and Eduardo Bueso in my 

Chapter 12

research group launched the hypothesis that (a) acid pHc may activate 
production of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species); (b) a certain level of ROS 
may inhibit growth without killing the plants; (c) ROS production is 
inhibited by over-expression of SBT4.13. 
 
In order to test this hypothesis Arabidopsis seedlings were preincubated in 
liquid medium containing 2.5 mM acetic acid for 24 h and then 
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was added and the 
incubation continued for 30 min. This compound becomes green 
fluorescent upon reaction with ROS. The results of one experiment are 
shown in Table 12.8. Cells contain an enzyme family that is specially 
dedicated to ROS production and called NADPH oxidases. We compared 
the wild type, the sbt4.13-1D mutant and a null mutant in two major 
NADPH oxidases of Arabidopsis (Atrboh D, F). ROS production was 
reduced in this mutant.

The important role of NADPH oxidases in mediating growth inhibition by 
intracellular acidification was demonstrated by testing the tolerance to 
weak organic acids of the double null mutant in the two major NADPH 
oxidases (Table 12.9). This mutant exhibited a similar tolerance to weak 
organic acids then R5.

These results demonstrate that the inhibition of growth in Arabidopsis by 
intracellular acidification is mediated by ROS production through NADPH 
oxidases. Intracellular acidification seems to inhibit growth of mammalian 
cells by inhibiting the TOR kinase. It will be interesting to check in the 
animal system the role of NADPH oxidases after the results of the present 
work (Bissoli, Muñoz-Bertomeu, Bueso, Sayas et al. 2020, article 1173). 
 
We could also explain the tolerance to oxidative stress of the aha2-4 
mutant and of the sbt4.13 over expression mutant. These mutants have 
acidic intracellular pH and one important cause of oxidative damage is the 
oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in proteins. As indicated in Figure 12.10 
the form of sulfhydryl groups suffering oxidation is the sulfide one, which 
at low intracellular pH is very low because the sulfhydryl form is 
dominant.

RECAPITULATION 
 
 
 
By reading this book we have taken a tour to many aspects of the 
mysterious phenomenon of life and I hope that readers will be able to 
answer the question raised by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger in his 
famous book “What is Life”. The physical aspect of the living cell (1944, 
2014 Cambridge University Press, ISBN 9781107295629). You are now 
familiar with the programs and machineries utilized by cells and the 
fascination for Molecular Biology may have conquered you. Biology is 
now an exact science like Physics and the applications of this part of 
science will be crucial for the medical care and nutrition of humanity. Let 
us go back to making research and teaching Molecular Biology.
