Introduction
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an emerging technology and one of the 
most rapidly growing segments of today’s automatic identification data collection 
(AIDC) industry. However, this emerging technology is not new; in fact, it is cur-
rently being used, in numerous applications throughout the world. It was originally 
implemented during World War II to identify and authenticate Allied planes, in an 
identification system known as Friend or Foe, and is still being used today for the 
same purposes.
RFID usage is steadily increasing, and companies across many industries are 
now looking at RFID to streamline operations, meet regulatory requirements, and 
prevent the introduction of counterfeit product into the supply chain to protect 
both consumer safety and company profitability. 
Today, industry experts view RFID not as a competition with but as a comple-
ment to bar code technology; in many cases, such as tracking pallets, cartons, and 
cases in a warehouse, both technologies are used. RFID technology, in fact, over-
comes certain limitations found in some bar code applications. Because it is not an 
optical technology like bar coding, no inherent line of sight is required between the 
reader and the tagged RFID object. In addition, RFID transmits data wirelessly and 
is a read/write technology, so it can update or change the data encoded in the tag 
during the tracking cycle.
For an RFID project to be successful, it is necessary to approach any business 
problems that may arise and any potential RFID solution by using a systems ap-
proach. In a design process, we need to look at all the processes, be forward think-
ing, and think creatively about how to improve each operation. Implementing an 
RFID-based system is like implementing any new system: RFID systems should be 
conceived, designed, and implemented using a systematic development process in 
which end users and specialists work together to design RFID systems based on the 
analysis of the business requirements of the organization. 
One of the greatest obstacles to the wide adoption of any new technology is a 
standardization process. The purpose of standardization is to define the most ef-
ficient platform on which an industry can operate and advance. For example, stan-
dardization would address the question of how to ensure that a tag manufactured 
and installed in one part of the world will be readable and the product properly 
identified on another side of the globe. 
Several organizations are involved in drafting standards for RFID technology, 
but in looking at the present status, it seems like it will be some time before all of

Introduction
the details are agreed on. Because RFID standardization is a very dynamic process, 
this book discusses only the present standards that were current at the time of this 
writing in a brief section and then provide readers with directions for pursuing 
further research. 
Despite the considerable technical diversity of RFID technology, much of it is 
largely transparent to prospective users and much can be done to promote aware-
ness of the technology’s attributes without going into considerable technical details. 
However, some basic technical knowledge is necessary for making an informed 
choice of products to meet particular application needs and to allow informed dis-
cussion among users, suppliers, systems integrators, and consultants.
This book introduces prospective users and system designers to the basics of 
RFID technology, including applications, benefits, technical characteristics, securi-
ty and privacy, as well as technical and economic challenges of standardization, de-
sign, and implementation. As these technical, policy, and cost challenges are slowly 
mitigated, RFID will likely become the system of choice for global commerce.
Numerous issues beyond the detailed technical and sheer operational capabili-
ties of RFID technology must be considered. Due to the large number of consid-
erations that must be undertaken, only a few intangible and theoretical consid-
erations, such as security, privacy, social, ethical, and future considerations, are 
presented in this book. 
In addition, this book mentions briefly a wide number of new and exciting top-
ics and concepts; some of them, at this point are only of marginal interest to RFID, 
with the hope of piquing readers’ interest in pursuing these new technologies.
This book should become a valuable resource to a wide spectrum of readers 
interested in exploring this new and exciting topic.
The first edition of this book was prepared and published almost four years 
ago. Since then, principles of RFID operation have become widely utilized in many 
branches of science and engineering, with biotech and medical applications being 
just some of the examples. Although briefly mentioned in the first edition, an up-
date of the book was required in order to cover these new developments in more 
details. 
I believe that the coverage of medical applications in biomedical field will at-
tract additional audience to this book, including biomedical engineers, program 
managers, and other professionals involved and/or interested in this new and fast-
developing field.
Because medical applications create many new ethical challenges, which at 
some point, will inevitably have to be discussed, a substantial amount of material 
has been added to the topic of ethical and moral dilemmas of technology.

2.1  Radio-Frequency Spectrum and Propagation
2.1.1  Theory of Electromagnetism and Maxwell’s Equations
James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) was a Scottish physicist and mathematician 
whose major discovery of the ether described the vast sea of space that made pos-
sible the transmission of light, heat, and radio waves. Maxwell’s nineteenth-century 
discovery of the ether (or its metaphor) led to many advances in electronic commu-
nications. His extension of the electromagnetic theory of light led directly to Hein-
rich Hertz’s discovery of radio waves and to the related advances in science and 
technology of today. Maxwell’s mathematical equations, expressing the behavior of 
electric and magnetic fields and their interrelated nature, were valid, even though 
his theory of the ether was not. 
Maxwell’s calculations were scientific observations resulting in his conclusion 
that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of 
the speed of light (300 million m/s). His proposal that the phenomenon of light is 
therefore an electromagnetic phenomenon seemed to fit what he and other scien-
tists could observe of the world around them. Maxwell concluded that visible light 
forms only a small part of the entire spectrum of possible Electromagnetic Radia-
tion (EMR).
Maxwell’s book, The Complete Laws of Electrodynamics, defines the relation-
ship between the electric field quantities and the magnetic field quantities, and 
although a detailed explanation of these laws is beyond the scope of this book, 
they deserve to be mentioned here at least briefly. Maxwell was the first to correctly 
assemble the complete laws of electrodynamics in his classic text in 1873. Mod-
ern electromagnetism theory is based on the four fundamental equations known 
as Maxwell’s equations. Before Maxwell, the laws of electrodynamics, including 
Gauss’s law, Ampere’s law of magnetostatics, and Faraday’s law, were laws of elec-
trostatics and did not predict waves. 
These laws correctly described what is known as the near field (i.e., the elec-
trostatic field of an electric charge and the magnetostatic field of a current loop). 
They described the observable impact of electric charges and magnetic fields close 
to the source but failed to describe the distant impact of these forces. In the static 
case, when all electric charges are permanently fixed or if they all move at a steady

state, the electric field and the magnetic field are not interconnected. This allows 
us to study electricity and magnetism as two distinct and separate phenomena. Up 
until Maxwell challenged conventional wisdom, the separation of electricity and 
magnetism was the accepted state of the world. 
Maxwell corrected Ampere’s law of magnetostatics to become Ampere’s law as 
corrected by Maxwell, so that consistency with the law of conservation of charge 
now occurred. Maxwell added a term indicating that vortices of magnetic fields 
can be displacement current density (time-varying electric flux density), as well as 
conduction current density. The resulting corrected equations define the complete 
laws of electrodynamics and predict electromagnetic waves. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz 
confirmed experimentally that these waves exist.
Maxwell showed that any conductor (e.g., an antenna) supplied with an alter-
nating current produces a varying magnetic field (H-field), which, in turn, produces 
electric field lines (E-field) in space. This is termed the near field. In the near field, 
both the E- and H-fields are relatively static with no propagation. They only vary 
in strength as the current varies, with the magnetic flux of the H-field coming out 
from the antenna, and going back in, and the E-field emanating outward. 
Maxwell also proved that beyond this quasi-static near field, both the E-fields 
and H-fields at a certain distance, detached themselves from the conductor and 
propagated into free space as a combined wave, moving at the speed of light with 
a constant ratio of E/H = 120π or 377 ohms. (Ohms are used because the E-field 
is measured in volts per meter and the H-field in amperes per meter.) The point in 
which this happens is called the far field. 
The electromagnetic waves are generated by the movement of electrical charges 
such as in a conductive metal object or antenna. Maxwell’s first two equations 
contain constants of proportionality that dictate the strengths of the fields. These 
are the permeability of the medium m in henries per meter and the permittivity of 
the medium ε in farads per meter. They are normally expressed (2.1) relative to the 
values in free space:

[F/m] are the values 
in free space, c is a speed of light in free space, and mr and er are the relative values 
(i.e., mr = er = 1 in free space and greater elsewhere). Free space strictly indicates 
a vacuum, but the same values can be used as good approximations for dry air at 
typical temperatures and pressures [1].
By applying the Maxwell’s equation to magnetic dipoles, we can identify that

 is of significance in determining the nature of the fields sur-
rounding the dipoles. Within this distance, we have the near-field region; beyond 
this distance, the far-field region starts. Maxwell’s equations correctly describe 
both the energy storage field and the energy propagation field.
It was the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann who said that “there is nothing more 
practical than a good theory,” and that is absolutely true in case of Maxwell’s

equations. Although highly theoretical and mathematical in their nature, they 
provided an unprecedented contribution to our understanding of the world 
around us, as well as very practical side in the form of the development of radio 
communications.
2.1.2  RF Propagation and Interference
Radio waves and microwaves are forms of electromagnetic energy we can col-
lectively describe by the term radio frequency (RF). RF emissions and associated 
phenomena can be discussed in terms of energy, radiation, or fields. We can de-
fine radiation as the propagation of energy through space in the form of waves or 
particles. Electromagnetic radiation can best be described as waves of electric and 
magnetic energy moving together (i.e., radiating) through space as illustrated in 
Figure 2.1. 
For example, the alternating movement of charge (i.e., the current) in an an-
tenna used by a radio or television broadcast station or in a cellular base station 
antenna generates electromagnetic waves. These waves that radiate away from the 
transmitting antenna are then intercepted by a receiving antenna such as a rooftop 
TV antenna, car radio antenna, or an antenna integrated into a handheld device 
such as a cellular phone or another wireless communications device. 
Continuous harmonic waves are typically sinusoidal in nature; thus, they are 
characterized by frequency, amplitude, and phase. They are also characterized by 
their three-dimensional shape. The energy radiated by any antenna is contained in 
a transverse electromagnetic wave (TEM) that is comprised of an electric field and 
a magnetic field. These fields are always orthogonal to one another and orthogonal 
to the direction of propagation.

or Poynting vector, named after the English physicist John Henry Poynting, who 
introduced it in 1884.
The term electromagnetic field is used to indicate the presence of electromag-
netic energy at a given location. The RF field can be described in terms of the 
electric and/or magnetic field strength at that location. Like any wave-related phe-
nomenon, electromagnetic energy can be characterized by a wavelength and/or 
frequency. 
Frequency, f, is defined as a number of cycles, or periods, per unit of time and 
is measured in hertz (Hz). The wavelength, λ, of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial 
period of the wave, that is, the distance over which the wave’s shape repeats. In 
other words, the wavelength is the distance by which the phase of the sinusoidal 
wave changes by 2p radians, so we can say: kl = 2p, w = kc, and f = w/2p. Angular 
frequency, ω, is a rotational unit of angular frequency 2πf with units in radians per 
second (rad/s). From here we have:

(2.2)
Electromagnetic waves travel through space at the speed of light, and the wave-
length and frequency of an electromagnetic wave are inversely related by a simple 
mathematical formula (2.2) connecting wavelength, speed of light, and frequency. 
Variation, or modulation, of the properties of the wave (amplitude, frequency, 
or phase) then allows information to be carried in the wave between its source 
(transmitter) and destination (receiver), which is the goal of every type of wireless 
communications.
Because the speed of light (c = 3 × 108 m/s or 1.86 × 105 miles/s) in a given 
medium or vacuum does not change, we can see from (2.2) that the high-frequency 
electromagnetic waves will have short wavelengths and the low-frequency waves 
will have long wavelengths. 
The electromagnetic spectrum1 includes all the various forms of electromagnet-
ic energy from extremely low-frequency (ELF) energy, with very long wavelengths, 
to X-rays and gamma rays, which have very high frequencies and correspondingly 
short wavelengths (Figure 2.2). Between these extremes are radio waves, micro-
waves, infrared radiation, visible light, and ultraviolet radiation, in that order. The 
RF part of the electromagnetic spectrum is generally defined as that part of the 
spectrum where electromagnetic waves have frequencies in the range of about 3 
kHz to 300 GHz.
Different frequencies have different propagation characteristics. All frequen-
cies are attenuated and reflected by materials to a greater or lesser degree, with 
the higher frequencies being more greatly attenuated than the lower frequencies. 
Low frequencies, such as the 125-kHz frequency, are attenuated very little as they 
propagate through materials, allowing them to have significant signal-penetration 
capabilities through all materials including metal.

When radiated and used in the far field, these frequencies can also have a sig-
nificant communication range. For example, we listen to AM radio stations (typi-
cally operating between 580 and 1,700 kHz) that were being broadcast hundreds 
of miles away from us, while FM radio stations, operating typically between 88 
and 108 MHz, have a range of about 20 miles.
For the regulations limiting RF emissions, the U.S. Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) distinguishes between intentional, unintentional, and inciden-
tal radiators: 
•• Intentional radiators are devices that intentionally emit RF energy, such as 
transmitters. 
•• Unintentional radiators are devices that intentionally generate RF energy for 
use only within the device or a cable system but not for the purpose of radia-
tion. Examples for unintentional radiators are computer motherboards and 
receivers with local oscillators. 
•• Incidental radiators are devices that are not designed to generate RF energy 
at all, but for which RF radiation may occur as an unwanted side effect. Ex-
amples of incidental radiators are dc motors and mechanical switches.
As with all waves, electromagnetic waves interact with one another whenever 
they intersect at a point in space. Depending on the phase, amplitude, and po-
larization, intersecting waves may either constructively interfere or destructively 
interfere. This is one of the basic properties of linear waves. The observed wave at 
a point of intersection is the addition of all of the waves at that point.

Constructive interference increases the amplitude of the detectable wave at that 
point while destructive interference decreases the amplitude of the detectable wave. 
Both of these cases could be harmful for the communications channel and the qual-
ity of the resulting signal.
When two waves that have traversed different length paths intersect at a point, 
they will be out of phase with one another. The phase difference is due to differ-
ences in the time required to traverse the different paths. Most phase differences 
cause destructive interference and may cause the observed wave at a point to ap-
pear to have a different frequency than what was originally transmitted.
Fundamental physics teaches us that at every boundary between two materi-
als, electromagnetic waves incident upon that boundary will be both transmitted 
from one material to the other and reflected back into the material in which they 
are traveling. Conducting materials, such as metals, act similar to perfect reflectors 
for UHF radiation. Materials such as glass, concrete, and cardboard are effectively 
RF transparent for waves that are incident upon them with an angle of incidence 
of 90°, but they become less transparent as the angle of incidence becomes more 
oblique. 
Some materials, such as water, act as both good reflectors of electromagnetic 
waves and good attenuators, or absorbers, of electromagnetic energy. The partial 
reflection of a wave results in the energy of the wave being separated to traverse 
multiple paths. The result is that a partial reflection attenuates the partially trans-
mitted wave by the amount of energy reflected at the boundary.
By passing through several materials and being reflected by several more, an 
electromagnetic wave traverses a path through the environment. In addition to 
attenuating the wave as it travels through the environment, the environment may 
impact the polarization of the wave. Two long parallel metal strips separated by a 
few inches, for example, will filter the UHF waves that are incident upon them by 
allowing waves that are polarized parallel to the metal strips to pass through the 
space between the strips, while electromagnetic waves polarized perpendicular to 
the metal strips will be reflected.
Electromagnetic waves are linear, meaning that the wave experienced at a point 
in space and time is the sum of the waves that intersect at that point. Because of 
reflections, attenuation, and different path lengths (multipath) caused by objects in 
the environment, the waves that arrive at a point in space may have amplitude that 
sums to zero or nearly zero. The position of nulls may be changed or the nulls may 
be eliminated by changing the position of the objects in the environment or chang-
ing the frequency being radiated by the antenna. 
When the environment is static, standing waves may result. The common oc-
currence is when the two waves intersect each other exactly half a wavelength (l/2) 
out of phase and completely cancel out the signals. 
2.1.3  Basic Antenna Parameters
Antennas are a very important component of communication systems. By defini-
tion, a transmitting antenna is a device used to transform an RF signal, traveling 
on a conductor, into an electromagnetic wave in free space. A receiving antenna 
performs an inverse function, that is, converts electromagnetic field into an electri-
cal signal that can be processed in the receiver. 

2.1  Radio-Frequency Spectrum and Propagation

Antennas demonstrate a property known as reciprocity, which means that an 
antenna will maintain the same characteristics regardless if it is transmitting or 
receiving. 
Most antennas are passive resonant devices, which operate efficiently over a 
relatively narrow frequency band. An antenna must be tuned to the same frequency 
band of the radio system to which it is connected; otherwise, the reception and the 
transmission will be impaired. When a signal is fed into an antenna, the antenna 
will emit radiation distributed in space in a certain way. A graphical representation 
of the relative angular distribution of the radiated power in space is called a radia-
tion pattern.
2.1.3.1  Antenna Polarization and Polarization Diversity
Polarization is a physical phenomenon of radio signal propagation and refers to the 
orientation of the electric field vector in the radiated wave. If the vector appears to 
rotate with time, then the wave is elliptically polarized. The ellipse so described may 
vary in ellipticity from a circle to a straight line, or from circular to linear polar-
ization. So, in the general sense, all polarization may be considered to be elliptical 
(Figure 2.3). 
For linear polarization, the vector remains in one plane as the wave propagates 
through space. Linear polarization has two subcategories: vertical polarization or 
horizontal polarization, and right- or left-handed for circular cases. 
The term used to describe the relationship between the magnitudes of the two 
linearly polarized electric field components in a circularly polarized wave is axial 
ratio. In a pure circularly polarized wave both electric field components have equal 
magnitude and the axial ratio, AR, is 1 or 0 dB (10 logAR). In a pure linearly polar-
ized wave, the axial ratio is equal to infinity. 
Generally speaking, in most cases two antennas that form a link with each 
other must be set for the same polarization; however, intentional exceptions are 
sometimes made, and we will discuss them here as well. When transmit and receive 
antennas are both linearly polarized, physical antenna misalignment will result in

a polarization mismatch loss (PML) that can be approximated using the following 
formula (2.3): 
	
(

]
20log cos

θ
=
	
(2.3)
where θ is the misalignment angle between the two antennas. For 15° we have a loss 
of 0.3 dB, for 30° we have 1.25 dB, for 45° we have 3 dB, and for 90° (orthogonal) 
we, ideally, have an infinite loss, which means no communication at all.
One of the common misconceptions regarding polarization relates to the cir-
cumstance where one antenna in a transmit-to-receive circuit is circularly polarized 
and the other is linearly polarized [2]. It is generally assumed that a 3-dB system 
loss will result because of the polarization difference between the two antennas. In 
fact, the polarizations mismatch loss between these two antennas will only be 3 dB 
when the circularly polarized antenna has an axial ratio of 0 dB. The actual mis-
match loss between a circularly polarized antenna and a linearly polarized antenna 
will vary depending on the axial ratio of the circularly polarized antenna. 
When the axial ratio of the circularly polarized antenna is greater than 0 dB, 
this indicates that one of the two linearly polarized components will respond to a 
linearly polarized signal more so than the other component will. When a linearly 
polarized wave is aligned with the circularly polarized linear component with the 
larger magnitude, the polarization mismatch loss will be less than 3 dB. When a lin-
early polarized wave is aligned with the circularly polarized linear component with 
the smaller magnitude, the polarization mismatch loss will be greater than 3 dB.
Assuming a 1-dB maximum axial ratio over the main beam, the signal loss, due 
to polarization mismatch, will be between 2.5 and 3.5 dB. We will see later that in 
RFID systems 3 dB will be used as an approximation and an average between the 
minimum and maximum polarization loss for a given axial ratio.
Multipath signals in RF systems arrive at the receiver’s antenna via the reflection 
of the direct signal from nearby objects. If the reflecting objects are oriented such 
that they are not aligned with the polarization of the incident wave, the reflected 
wave will experience a polarization shift. The resultant or total signal available to 
the receiver at either end of the communications link will be the vector summation 
of the direct signal and all of the multipath signals. In many instances, a number 
of signals arriving at the receive site will not be aligned with the assumed standard 
polarization of the system antenna. As the receive antenna rotates from vertical to 
horizontal, it simply intercepts or receives energy from these multiple signals. 
To improve or extend system performance, some system designers use receive 
polarization diversity techniques in an effort to enhance signal reception. In these 
systems, a circularly polarized or dual linearly polarized antenna will be used at the 
receive site to take advantage of the fact that many linearly polarized multipath sig-
nals, with different orientation, exist at the receiving site. These circular and dual 
polarized antennas theoretically have a better chance of receiving more total signal 
than a single, linearly polarized antenna.
Polarization of the waves in RFID systems becomes very important in tag an-
tenna designs and deployments; antennas may be designed such that they efficiently 
capture and communicate with energy in one or a few different polarizations. If a 
reader antenna is linearly polarized and the tag antenna is linearly polarized, then 
the tag and the reader may communicate only when both antennas are oriented 

2.1  Radio-Frequency Spectrum and Propagation 
11
in the same linear direction. Circularly polarized antennas reduce the orientation 
requirements, but do not completely eliminate the orientation dependence for op-
timal performance.
It is difficult to predict the orientation of the electric field in the near-field 
region (i.e., very close to the antenna), because the transmitting antenna cannot 
be considered as a point source in this region. In the far-field region, the antenna 
becomes a point source, the electric and magnetic components of the field become 
orthogonal to the direction of propagation, and their polarization characteristics 
do not vary with distance. 
Most RF and microwave systems operate in far-field region, with the excep-
tion of passive point-to-point microwave repeaters. Some RFID systems at lower 
frequencies operate in the near field and, as we will see later, use coupling methods 
instead of usual electromagnetic wave propagation.
2.1.3.2  Impedance Matching and Return Loss
Input Impedance
For an efficient transfer of energy, the impedance of the radio, of the antenna, and 
of the transmission cable connecting them must be the same. Transceivers and their 
transmission lines are typically designed for 50Ω impedance. If the antenna has im-
pedance different from 50Ω, then there is a mismatch and an impedance matching 
circuit is required. Of course, other impedances are also common.
Standing Waves and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)
In order for the antenna to operate efficiently, maximum transfer of power must 
take place between the transmitter and the antenna. Maximum power transfer can 
take place only when the impedance of the antenna is matched to that of the trans-
mitter. According to the maximum power transfer theorem, maximum power can 
be transferred only if the impedance of the transmitter is a complex conjugate of the 
impedance of the antenna under consideration and vice versa [3]. 
Transmitter and load are usually connected through some type of transmission 
line; transmitter and the load have to be matched with the transmission line for 
the optimal transfer of power. If the condition for matching is not satisfied, then 
some of the power maybe reflected back, leading to the creation of standing waves, 
which can be characterized by a parameter called the voltage standing wave ratio 
(VSWR), written, for example, as 1.2:1.
Matching the load ZL to the transmission line is very important, and although 
for most applications in radio communications, the VSWR is required to be smaller 
than 2, in some applications (RFID, for example) of interest are also the following 
special cases (2.4):

Another way to think about VSWR is it is the amount of input power needed 
to get an equivalent of unity power out. In transmission line theory the accepted 
definition is that standing waves are created by superposition of two waves travel-
ing in opposite direction.
The reflection coefficient at the load, ΓL, can be calculated as follows:

and VSWR can be calculated according to:

(2.6)
Note that the reflection coefficient defined above is the reflection coefficient at 
the load. It is possible to define a generalized reflection coefficient along the line 
and see that the magnitude does not change as we move along the line; only the 
phase changes.
Because the standing wave ratio is not always calculated from the voltages, the 
V is sometimes dropped from VSWR, and the term is referred to as standing wave 
ratio (SWR). The terms VSWR and SWR can be used interchangeably.
Return Loss
The return loss (RL) is another way of expressing impedance mismatch. It is a 
logarithmic ratio measured in decibels that compares the power reflected by the 
antenna to the power that is fed into the antenna from the transmission line. For a 
matched load, VSWR = 1. The relationship between VSWR and return loss is the 
shown in the (2.7):

The reflection coefficient, the return loss, and VSWR are all quantities used for 
describing impedance matching.
2.1.3.3  Bandwidth
The bandwidth of an antenna refers to the range of frequencies over which the 
antenna can operate correctly. The antenna’s bandwidth is the number of hertz for 
which the antenna will exhibit a VSWR of less than 2:1. 
The bandwidth (BW) can also be described in terms of percentage (2.8) of the 
center frequency of the band.

where fH is the highest frequency in the band, fL is the lowest frequency in the 
band, and fC is the center frequency in the band. In this way, bandwidth is constant 
relative to frequency. If bandwidth was expressed in absolute units of frequency, it 
would be different depending upon the center frequency. Different types of anten-
nas have various bandwidth limitations.
2.1.3.4  Directivity and Gain
Directivity is the ability of an antenna to focus energy in a particular direction when 
transmitting or to receive energy better from a particular direction when receiving. 
In a static situation, it is possible to use the antenna directivity to concentrate the 
radiation beam in the given direction. 
Gain is not a quantity which can be defined in terms of a physical quantity such 
as the watt or the ohm, but it is a dimensionless ratio. Gain is given in reference to 
a standard antenna. The two most common reference antennas are the isotropic 
antenna and the resonant half-wave dipole antenna. 
The isotropic antenna radiates equally well in all directions. Real isotropic an-
tennas do not exist, but they provide useful and simple theoretical antenna patterns 
with which to compare real antennas. 
Any real antenna will radiate more energy in some directions than in others. 
Since it cannot create energy (antenna is a passive device), the total power radiated 
is the same as an isotropic antenna, so in other directions it must radiate less en-
ergy. The gain of an antenna in a given direction is the amount of energy radiated 
in that direction compared to the energy that an isotropic antenna would radiate 
in the same direction when driven with the same input power. Usually we are only 
interested in the maximum gain, which is the gain in the direction in which the 
antenna is radiating most of the power. 
An antenna gain of 3 dB compared to an isotropic antenna would be written 
as 3 dBi. The resonant half-wave dipole can be a useful standard for comparing to 
other antennas at one frequency or over a very narrow band of frequencies. Com-
paring the dipole to an antenna over a range of frequencies requires a number of 
dipoles of different lengths. 
An antenna gain of 3 dB compared to a dipole antenna would be written as 3 
dBd. Compared to the gain of an ideal isotropic antenna of 1 (0 dB), the gain of a 
half-wave dipole antenna is 1.64 (2.15 dB). 
The relationship between the two units, dBi and dBd, is therefore expressed as 
follows:

2.1.3.5  Radiation Pattern
The radiation pattern of an antenna is a plot of the far-field radiation from the an-
tenna. An antenna’s radiation pattern is usually plotted by normalizing the radiation 

14 
����������������������������������
Short-Range Communications Systems
intensity by its maximum value and plotting the result. To compare radiation pat-
terns, a few different parameters, described next, can be used.
Beamwidth
An antenna’s beamwidth is usually understood to mean the half-power beamwidth. 
The peak radiation intensity is found and then the points on either side of the peak, 
which represent half the power of the peak intensity, are located. The angular dis-
tance between the half-power points is defined as the beamwidth. 
Half the power expressed in decibels is -3 dB, so the half-power beamwidth is 
sometimes referred to as the 3-dB beamwidth. Both horizontal and vertical beam-
widths are usually considered. 
Assuming that most of the radiated power is not divided into sidelobes, then 
the directive gain is inversely proportional to the beamwidth (i.e., as the beam-
width decreases, the directive gain increases).
Sidelobes
No antenna is able to perfectly radiate all the energy in one preferred direction. 
Some is inevitably radiated in other directions. The peaks are referred to as sid-
elobes, commonly specified in decibels down from the main lobe.
Nulls
In an antenna radiation pattern, a null is a zone in which the effective radiated 
power is at a minimum. A null often has a narrow directivity angle compared to 
that of the main beam. Thus, the null is useful for several purposes, such as suppres-
sion of interfering signals in a given direction.
Front-to-Back Ratio
It is useful to know the front-to-back ratio, which is the ratio of the maximum 
directivity of an antenna to its directivity in the rearward direction. For example, 
when the principal plane pattern is plotted on a relative decibel scale, the front-to-
back ratio is the difference in decibels between the level of the maximum radiation 
and the level of radiation in an opposite direction (180°).
2.1.3.6  Antenna Modeling
The equations extracted from both the receiving and transmitting antenna models 
allow us to describe the behavior of a single bidirectional antenna. In both cases, 
antenna systems can be represented using Thevenin’s equivalent circuits.
In the transmit mode, an antenna system can be represented by a Thevenin 
circuit equivalent, as shown in Figure 2.4. In this figure, the antenna is represented 
by impedance ZA given by (2.10):

(2.10) 
The radiating element is symbolized by a radiation resistance Rr and an imagi-
nary part XA. In this case, RL represents both the conduction and the dielectric 
losses of the antenna. The source to which the antenna is connected is represented 

2.1  Radio-Frequency Spectrum and Propagation 
15
by an ideal generator Vg having its own internal complex impedance consisting of 
Rg and jXg. 
The energy transferred to the antenna and its environs by the reactive power 
flow is stored mostly in the reactive near field. The energy transferred to the an-
tenna by the resistive power flow either heats up the antenna structure (or objects 
in the near-field region of the antenna) or else is radiated; most often, combination 
of both of these phenomena occur. 
Thus, we can break down the resistive part, R, of the driving point impedance 
into the sum of a loss resistance, RL, which gets hot, and a radiation resistance, Rr. 
Because the purpose of an antenna is to radiate energy, it is therefore the radiation 
resistance Rr that is most interesting. 
The radiation power delivered by the antenna is the power collected by resis-
tance Rr and it is given by:

where It is the current through Rr. 
The factor 2 arises because the average value of the square of a unit sinusoidal 
signal over one cycle is just 1/2. In determining the average power dissipated, we 
intrinsically assume that the average is taken over a whole number of cycles of the 
ac signal.

The maximum power at maximum efficiency will be transferred when the im-
pedances are complex conjugate matched throughout the power chain, from the 
transmitter output, through the transmission line (which may be a balanced pair, a 
coaxial cable, or a waveguide), to the antenna system, which consists of an imped-
ance matching device and the radiating element(s). For maximum power, Zload = 
Zsource* (where * indicates the complex conjugate).
If we consider a lossless antenna (RL = 0), the ideal amount of power col-
lected by Rr is calculated by combining (2.12) and (2.13) and given by the resulting 
equation:

It follows that the maximum power transferred to the load will be one-half 
the total power, while the other half is being lost. If the generator and antenna are 
mismatched, the transferred power will be even lower.
The case of a receiving antenna is very similar. Power collected induces a volt-
age Vr on the receiving antenna, which is analogous to Vg of the transmitting anten-
na model. The Thevenin equivalent circuit of the receiving antenna and its load is 
shown in Figure 2.5. The load to which the receiving antenna is connected (receiver 
and transmission line) is represented by the receiver’s input complex impedance,

Rrec and Xrec. As previously shown for the transmitting model, we can derive the 
functional equations from this receiving antenna model as well.
Typically, the gain in any given direction and the impedance at a given fre-
quency are the same when the antenna is used in transmission or in reception, due 
to reciprocity. 
2.1.4  Range of a Radio Communications System
For any given radio transmitter and receiver, there is a maximum distance (or range) 
over which communications can work reliably. If the separation between transmit-
ter and receiver in increased beyond this distance, the receiver will no longer be able 
to correctly recreate the information being transmitted.
It is prudent to operate a radio communications system with a certain margin, 
that is, not right at the maximum range, because the exact range is likely to vary 
from moment to moment, and this must be accommodated to achieve reliable per-
formance. The exact range will be affected by a number of factors, but in simple 
terms there are four:
1.	 The power contained in the wave transmitted;
2.	 The sensitivity of the receiving equipment;
3.	 The environment through which the wave travels;
4.	 The presence of interference.
These are largely self-explanatory, but of particular importance is the rela-
tionship between power and distance. As the radio wave travels away from the 
transmitting antenna, it disperses in all directions. This means that every time the 
distance from the transmitter doubles, the proportion of the original wave that is 
available for reception is quartered (the so-called inverse square relationship).
Also note the effect that the environment has on radio communication; when 
electromagnetic radiation passes through materials, it may be absorbed to a certain 
extent, depending on the properties of the material and the type of radiation. This 
absorption results in a reduction of the strength of the radiation, a process known 
as attenuation. This attenuation increases with the thickness of the material. 
Visible light is absorbed relatively easily, whereas radio waves are more likely 
to pass through materials (especially gases in the atmosphere, such as nitrogen and 
oxygen, and also paper, cardboard, and certain plastics) with only little attenuation 
of the radiation. Other materials (metal and liquids, for example) have a stronger 
attenuating effect, although such attenuation varies depending on the frequency of 
the wave. 
In addition to attenuation by absorption, certain frequencies of radio waves 
are also susceptible to multipath fading. This occurs when waves are reflected by 
objects in the environment, and the reflections interfere with the original wave-
form, making it much more difficult for the radio wave receiver to determine the 
original wave. In the worst case there are positions (called nulls) in which reception 
is not possible even though the transmitter and receiver are relatively close to each 
other. Similarly, if there are any other radio waves being transmitted on a similar 
frequency, they will cause interference in the same manner.

2.2  Spread-Spectrum Communications Systems
Human society is entering an era of ubiquitous computing,2 when networks are 
seamlessly interconnected and information is always accessible when needed. This 
is the computing environment that all objects and target in physical environment 
become intelligent and exchange the information by linking each other. 
The practical implementation of ubiquitous services requires three levels of 
connectivity: wide area networks (WAN), typically via the Internet, to remotely 
connect all types of severs and terminals; local area networks (LAN), typically via 
Ethernet or Wi-Fi connectivity among all the information and communication ap-
pliances in offices and homes; and human area networks (HAN) for connectivity 
to personal information, media and communication appliances within the much 
smaller sphere of ordinary daily activities (i.e., the last 1 meter or 3 feet). Short-
range wireless technology already plays a key role in scenarios where people are 
connected anywhere and anytime by different types of communication links.
Short-range radio communications Devices (SRD) have been used for many 
years to provide low-cost services such as short-range telemetry, voice and video 
communications, radio LANs, and security systems (Figure 2.6). They are defined 
by the ITU-R as “radio transmitters which have a low capability of causing inter-
ference to other radio equipment.” In recent years, there has been rapid growth 
in the use of SRDs, driven by new technologies and international coordination on 
specifications. 
Designers of SRD wireless systems need to exercise great care in selecting the 
radio’s communication frequency. In most cases, the choice is limited to those por-
tions of the spectrum that allow license-exempt operation given that certain spec-
ifications and conditions on usage are met. The international coordination has 
included attempts to provide common spectrum allocations in the major trading 
2.	
The concept called ubiquitous (meaning “that is everywhere”) was introduced by Xerox’s PARC (Palo Alto 
Research Center) in 1988 for the first time.

regions to ensure mass markets and minimize the chance of nonstandard equip-
ment appearing on the market.
Products typically operating in the frequency range between 300 MHz and 2.5 
GHz are often referred to as industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)-band products 
in the United States and short-range device (SRD) products in the European Union 
(EU). Both the U.S. and EU regulatory agencies place limitations on the operating 
frequencies, output power, spurious emissions, modulation methods, and transmit 
duty cycles, among other things. 
The 2.4-GHz band is widely used by designers who want to build systems that 
can operate worldwide, and in fact, it has become the frequency band of choice 
for such standards as Bluetooth, WLAN, and ZigBee. The 5.8-GHz band has also 
attracted some attention in cordless phones or the 802.11a version of WLAN, for 
example.
In the United States, the regulations governing license-exempt wireless prod-
ucts fall into two broad categories: periodic devices and ISM-band devices. The 
type of application and the communications range determine the appropriate band 
and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) classification to use. In the Eu-
ropean Union, the regulations governing low-power wireless devices are essentially 
defined by two separate bodies. One group defines the allocation of frequency 
bands and their use, and another group defines the test methodologies and general 
transceiver specifications.
License-exempt systems often (although not always) use spread-spectrum prin-
ciple of operation, originally developed by the military to counter attempts to de-
tect, decode, or block signal transmissions. The most important peacetime charac-
teristics of spread-spectrum systems are that they facilitate radio communications 
in a manner that minimizes the potential to cause harmful interference to other 
services and are able to withstand higher levels of interference than other technolo-
gies. Hence, spread-spectrum systems have significant potential to share common 
spectrum with other services. Spread-spectrum devices operate on a license fee-
exempt basis, if the technical conditions are met, and type approval is mandatory. 
Two main types of spread-spectrum system are commercially available: di-
rect sequence and frequency hopping. Prior to the latest EN 300 220 specification 
(1996), however, the U.S. and European bodies took vastly different regulatory ap-
proaches. The United States adopted a frequency-hopping approach, while Europe 
applied duty-cycle limits in each of the subbands as described in the ERC REC-70 
document. Both of these implementations are useful in minimizing interference, but 
manufacturers who were designing systems for both regions needed to completely 
rewrite the media-access layer (MAC) in the system’s communication protocol. 
Fortunately, the latest European EN 300 220 regulations have extended the fre-
quency bands to allow for frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS) or direct-
sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS), thus making the MAC implementations more 
similar to those designed for the U.S. market.
Aside from the two most popular spread-spectrum systems, described below, 
an interesting aspect of the new European regulations is that they provide for other 
wideband spread-spectrum modulation schemes in addition to FHSS and DSSS. 
FSK/GFSK (Gaussian frequency-shift-keying) modulation, with an occupied band-
width greater than 200 kHz, is considered wideband modulation under the Euro-
pean regulations.

Short-Range Communications Systems
Many countries do not have rules for license-exempt systems like the United 
States. Instead, they allocate spectrum on a primary or secondary basis and require 
that all radio transmitters be licensed by the government. Similar to the United 
States, several other countries do not allocate spectrum specifically for RFID but 
to categories of service such as short-range devices. In 2006, the ITU-R released a 
Recommendation SM.1538-2 [4] that outlines the spectrum requirements and reg-
ulatory approaches applicable to short-range devices in Europe, the United States, 
the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and South Korea. 
2.2.1  Frequency-Hopping Spread-Spectrum Systems
The FHSS transmission technology spreads energy in the time domain by dividing 
the spectrum into a number of channels, switching between them in a pseudo-ran-
dom sequence or hopping code, that is known by both the receiver and transmitter. 
U.S. and European standards both specify a similar number of hopping channels, 
and a maximum dwell time (the time spent at a particular frequency during any 
single hop) of 400 ms. 
Bandwidths of up to 7 MHz are available once either the listen-before-talk 
(LBT) or duty-cycle limits are met, as compared to the 2-MHz range available pre-
viously. Listen-before-talk, a “polite” communication protocol, scans the channel 
for activity before initiating a transmission. Also called clear-channel-assessment 
(CCA), systems using it with frequency hopping have no duty-cycle limitations.
2.2.2  Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum Systems
Besides FHSS, direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) is also addressed in the new 
European regulations. In a DSSS system, a narrowband signal is multiplied by a 
high-speed pseudorandom number (PRN) sequence to generate a spread signal. 
Each PRN pulse is called a chip, and the rate of the sequence is called the chip rate. 
The extent to which the original narrowband signal is spread is referred to as the 
processing gain; it is the ratio of the chip rate to the narrowband data symbol rate. 
At the receiver, the incoming spread-spectrum signal is multiplied with the 
same PRN code to despread the signal, allowing the original narrowband signal 
to be extracted. At the same time, any narrowband interferers at the receiver are 
spread and appear to the demodulator as wideband noise. The allocation of differ-
ent PRN codes to each user in the system allows isolation between users in the same 
frequency band. This is known as code-division multiple access (CDMA).
A few examples of systems using DSSS modulation include IEEE 802.15.4 
(WPAN), IEEE 802.11 (WLAN), and the global positioning system (GPS). The 
main advantages of DSSS are:
•• Interference resilience: The essence of the interference-rejection capability of 
DSSS is that the useful signal gets multiplied twice (spread and despread) by 
the PRN code while any interferers are multiplied just once (spread).
•• Low-power spectral density: Introducing minimal interference with existing 
narrowband systems.

•• Security: Very resistant to jamming because of spreading/dispreading.
•• Mitigation of multipath effects.
2.3  WLAN
2.3.1  Basics of WLAN
Four standards dominate the WLAN marketplace; 802.11b has been the industry 
standard for several years. Operating in the license-exempt portion of the 2.4-GHz 
RF spectrum, it delivers a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps and boasts numerous 
strengths. 802.11b has broad user acceptance and vendor support since many ven-
dors manufacture compatible devices, and this compatibility is assured through the 
Wi-Fi certification program. Thousands of enterprise organizations that typically 
find its speed and performance acceptable for their current applications have de-
ployed 802.11b technology. 
In the United States, a number of wireless ISPs have emerged who are offering 
public access services using IEEE 802.11b equipment operating in the 2.4-GHz 
band. These providers are targeting public areas in which business travelers may 
wish to access corporate intranets or the Internet, for instance, in hotels or coffee 
shops. In some parts of Europe there are now a number of service providers, both 
mobile operators and ISPs, offering wireless Internet services based on 802.11b 
technology in the 2.4-GHz band. 
Another WLAN standard, IEEE 802.11a, operates in the uncluttered 5-GHz 
radio frequency spectrum. With a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps, this standard 
offers a fivefold performance increase over the 802.11b standard. Therefore, it pro-
vides greater bandwidth for particularly demanding applications. The IEEE ratified 
the 802.11a standard in 1999, but the first 802.11a-compliant products did not be-
gin appearing on the market until December 2001. The 802.11a standard delivers 
a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps and eight nonoverlapping frequency channels, 
resulting in increased network capacity, improved scalability, and the ability to cre-
ate microcellular deployments without interference from adjacent cells.
Operating in the license-exempt portion of the 5-GHz radio band, 802.11a is 
also immune to interference from devices that operate in the 2.4-GHz band, such 
as microwave ovens, cordless phones, and Bluetooth (a short-range, low-speed, 
point-to-point, personal-area-network wireless standard). The 802.11a standard 
is not compatible with existing 802.11b-compliant wireless devices. The 2.4-GHz 
and 5-GHz equipment can operate in the same physical environment without 
interference.
IEEE 802.11g is also widely adopted high-performance standard, it delivers the 
same 54-Mbps maximum data rate as 802.11a, and it operates in the same 2.4-
GHz band as 802.11b.
Because this spectrum is license-exempt, even more uses for it are expected to 
develop in the future. As the band becomes more widely used, radio interference 
will increase. Bluetooth uses FHSS and is a shorter range and lower bandwidth 
technology than 802.11b and it uses frequently changing, narrow bands over all 
channels. Not only do microwave ovens operate within this range, but other RF 
communications technologies as well, most notable of which is IEEE 802.11b.

Short-Range Communications Systems
802.11n is newer standard for wireless local-area networks with the real data 
throughput estimated to reach a theoretical 540 Mbps. 802.11n builds upon previ-
ous 802.11 standards by adding multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO). 
MIMO uses multiple transmitter and receiver antennas to allow for increased 
data throughput through spatial multiplexing and increased range by exploiting 
the spatial diversity and new coding schemes. Channels operating at 40 MHz are 
another feature incorporated into 802.11n, which doubles the channel width from 
20 MHz in previous 802.11 PHYs to transmit data. The IEEE approved the amend-
ment, and it was published in October 2009. 
2.3.2  WLAN Components
A WLAN is made up of two key components: an access point (AP), or base station, 
that is usually, but not necessarily, physically connected to a LAN and a wireless 
card that is either built into or added to a computer device, be it a handheld (i.e., 
PDA), tablet, laptop, or desktop computer (Figure 2.7).
With a wireless LAN in place, portable computers can remain connected to the 
network while on the move. Any device with a wireless adaptor within range of an 
access point can potentially connect to the WLAN, thus providing greatly increased 
freedom and flexibility compared to a wired network. 
Extending the WLAN to include additional users often only requires that the 
user has a wireless-enabled computer device and is in range of an access point. 
Figure 2.7  WLAN components.

2.4  Wireless Personal Area Network 
23
Increasing the overall network coverage of the WLAN can often be achieved by 
adding further access points.
2.4  Wireless Personal Area Network
Wireless personal area network (WPAN) is defined as a network of a very limited 
radius, up to 10 feet (3.3m), occupying a very small amount of space. Specification 
802.15 is a wireless specification defined by IEEE for WPANs, which has characters 
such as short range, low power, low cost, small networks and communication of 
devices within a personal operating space (POS). 
As radios decrease their cost and power consumption, it becomes feasible to 
embed them in more types of electronic devices, which can be used to create smart 
homes, sensor networks, and other exciting new applications. Two radio technolo-
gies have emerged to support this trend, Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) and ZigBee 
(IEEE 802.15.4). WPANs come in another variation that targets high data rates 
for image and multimedia applications, known as high-rate wireless personal area 
network, described by the IEEE 802.15.3 standard.
2.4.1  Bluetooth
Bluetooth3 radios provide short-range connections between wireless devices along 
with rudimentary networking capabilities. Bluetooth is mainly used for short-range 
communications, for example, from a laptop to a nearby printer or from a cell 
phone to a wireless headset. Its normal range of operation is 10m (at 1-mW trans-
mit power), and this range can be increased to 100m by increasing the transmit 
power to 100 mW. 
The Bluetooth standard is based on a tiny microchip incorporating a radio 
transceiver that is built into digital devices. The transceiver takes the place of a 
connecting cable for devices such as cell phones, laptop and palmtop computers, 
portable printers and projectors, and network access points. The system operates 
in the license-exempt 2.4-GHz frequency band; hence, it can be used worldwide 
without any licensing issues. 
For carrier frequencies, 79 RF channels are available in the 2.4-GHz frequency 
band and the following relation is valid:

The RF channel bandwidth is 1.0 MHz. In order to comply with out-of-band 
regulations, the guard bands are defined. The lower guard-band bandwidth is 2.0 
MHz, and the upper guard-band bandwidth is 3.5 MHz. 
The Bluetooth standard provides one asynchronous data channel at 723.2 
kbps. In this mode, also known as asynchronous connectionless (ACL) there is a 
3.	
The Bluetooth standard is named after Harald I Bluetooth, the king of Denmark between 940 and 985 AD, 
who united Denmark and Norway. Bluetooth technology proposes to unite devices via radio connections, 
hence the inspiration for its name. The Bluetooth standard was developed jointly by 3Com, Ericsson, Intel, 
IBM, Lucent, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and Toshiba.

reverse channel with a data rate of 57.6 kbps. The specification also allows up to 
three synchronous channels, each at a rate of 64 kbps. This mode, also known as 
Synchronous Connection Oriented (SCO), is mainly used for voice applications 
such as headsets, but can also be used for data. These different modes result in an 
aggregate bit rate of approximately 1 Mbps. 
Routing of the asynchronous data is done via a packet switching protocol based 
on frequency hopping at 1,600 hops per second. There is also a circuit-switching 
protocol for the synchronous data. Bluetooth uses frequency hopping for multiple 
access with a carrier spacing of 1.0 MHz and typically, up to 80 different frequen-
cies are used, for a total bandwidth of 80 MHz. At any given time, the bandwidth 
available is 1 MHz, with a maximum of eight devices sharing the bandwidth. Dif-
ferent logical channels (different hopping sequences) can simultaneously share the 
same 80-MHz bandwidth. Collisions will occur when devices in different piconets, 
on different logical channels, happen to use the same hop frequency at the same 
time. As the number of piconets in an area increases, the number of collisions in-
creases, and performance degrades.
Bluetooth technology allows for the replacement of the many proprietary ca-
bles that connect one device to another with one universal short-range radio link. 
But beyond replacing the cables, Bluetooth radio technology provides a universal 
bridge to existing data networks, a peripheral interface, and a mechanism to form 
small, private, ad hoc groupings of connected devices away from fixed network 
infrastructures. Designed to operate in a noisy RF environment, the Bluetooth ra-
dio uses a fast acknowledgment and frequency-hopping scheme to make the link 
robust. Bluetooth radio modules avoid interference from other signals by hopping 
to a new frequency after transmitting or receiving a packet. 
Compared with other systems operating in the same frequency band, its radio 
typically hops faster and uses shorter packets, thus making the Bluetooth radio 
more robust than other systems. Short packages and fast hopping also limit the im-
pact of domestic and professional microwave ovens. Use of forward error correc-
tion (FEC) limits the impact of random noise on long-distance links. The encoding 
is optimized for an uncoordinated environment since Bluetooth radios operate in 
the license-exempt ISM band at 2.4 GHz.
Bluetooth can support an asynchronous data channel, up to three simultaneous 
synchronous voice channels, or a channel that simultaneously supports asynchro-
nous data and synchronous voice. Each voice channel supports 64-kbps synchro-
nous (voice) link. The asynchronous channel can support an asymmetric link of 
maximally 721 kbps in either direction while permitting 57.6 kbps in the return 
direction or a 432.6-kbps symmetric link. 
The Bluetooth system supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 
connections; a piconet is an ad hoc computer network of devices using Bluetooth 
technology protocols to allow one master device to interconnect with up to seven 
active slave devices (3-bit address space limits the number of devices in any pi-
conet to eight). Up to 255 further slave devices can be inactive, or parked, which 
the master device can bring into active status at any time. Several piconets can be 
established and linked together in an ad hoc manner, in which each piconet is iden-
tified by a different frequency-hopping sequence, and all users participating on the 
same piconet are synchronized to this hopping sequence. The topology can best be 
described as a multiple piconet structure.

2.4  Wireless Personal Area Network 
25
Voice channels use the continuous variable slope delta modulation (CVSD) 
voice coding scheme and never retransmit voice packets. The CVSD method was 
chosen for its robustness in handling dropped and damaged voice samples. Rising 
interference levels are experienced as increased background noise: even at bit-error 
rates (BER) up to 4%, the CVSD coded voice is quite audible. The Bluetooth air 
interface is based on a nominal antenna power of 0 dBm. The air interface com-
plies with the FCC rules for the ISM band at power levels up to 0 dBm. Spectrum 
spreading has been added to facilitate optional operation at power levels up to 100 
mW (20 dBm) worldwide. Spectrum spreading is accomplished by frequency hop-
ping in 79 hops displaced by 1 MHz, between 2.402 GHz and 2.480 GHz. Due 
to local regulations, the bandwidth is reduced in Japan, France, and Spain. This is 
handled by an internal software switch. 
Different master/slave pairs of the same piconet can use different link types, 
and the link type may change arbitrarily during a session. Each link type supports 
up to 16 different packet types. Four of these are control packets and are common 
for both SCO and ACL links. Both link types use a time division duplex (TDD) 
scheme for full-duplex transmissions. There are three error-correction schemes de-
fined for Bluetooth baseband controllers:
•• 1/3 rate FEC;
•• 2/3 rate FEC;
•• Automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme for data.
The purpose of the FEC scheme on the data payload is to reduce the number of 
retransmissions. However, in a reasonably error-free environment, FEC creates un-
necessary overhead that reduces the throughput. Therefore, the packet definitions 
have been kept flexible as to whether or not to use FEC in the payload. The packet 
header is always protected by a 1/3 rate FEC; it contains valuable link information 
and should survive bit errors. An unnumbered ARQ scheme is applied in which 
data transmitted in one slot is directly acknowledged by the recipient in the next 
slot. For a data transmission to be acknowledged both the header error check and 
the cyclic redundancy check must be okay; otherwise, a negative acknowledge is 
returned.
In April 2009, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) formally adopted 
Bluetooth Core Specification Version 3 High Speed (HS), or Bluetooth 3. Bluetooth 
3 gets its speed from the 802.11 radio protocol. The inclusion of the 802.11 Proto-
col Adaptation Layer (PAL) provides increased throughput of data transfers at the 
approximate rate of 24 Mbps. In addition, mobile devices, including Bluetooth 3, 
will realize increased power savings due to enhanced power control being built in.
In July 2010, the Bluetooth SIG announced the formal adoption of Bluetooth 
Core Specification Version 4.0 with the important new feature, Bluetooth low-en-
ergy technology. Low-energy technology is an evolution in Bluetooth wireless tech-
nology that will enable many new applications, including health care [5]. Similar to 
previous versions of Bluetooth, Bluetooth low-energy technology will operate using 
a simple protocol stack, and will be used primarily in short-range communications 
systems.

For example, a product that Bluetooth makes possible is a wireless electrocar-
diogram. Each patient lead can be designed as a separate battery-powered Blue-
tooth device that communicates with a battery-powered, Bluetooth-enabled pa-
tient monitor. That patient monitor, which also communicates with the hospital’s 
802.11b network (WLAN), is continuously sending the electrocardiogram data to 
the network, and the doctor can monitor this data from anywhere in the hospital 
using his or her handheld PDA.
2.4.2  ZigBee
The ZigBee4 radio specification is designed for lower cost and power consumption 
than Bluetooth. ZigBee can be defined as a low tier, ad hoc, terrestrial, and wireless 
standard, and in some ways it is similar to Bluetooth. It is promoted by ZigBee Alli-
ance and described in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, but ZigBee has some features in 
addition to those of 802.15.4. Another protocol was needed because other existing 
short-range protocols such as 802.11 and 802.15 use too much power and the pro-
tocols are too complex, and thus too expensive, to be embedded in virtually every 
kind of device imaginable. 
Potential applications are sensors, interactive toys, and remote controls. In ad-
dition, ZigBee technology makes it possible to control home networks, such as 
those used for controlling electrical appliances, checking temperature and humid-
ity, and sending mobile messages to alarm in cases of trespass.
The goal of ZigBee is to provide radio operation for months or years without 
recharging, thereby targeting applications such as sensor networks and inventory 
tags. The IEEE 802.15 WPAN Task Group 4 (TG4) was chartered to investigate 
a low data rate solution with a multimonth-to-multiyear battery life and very low 
complexity, and the new standard has been published as IEEE 802.15.4-2006, 
which is the latest version at the time of this writing. It operates in the 2.4-GHz 
(ISM) radio band, the same band as 802.11b standard, Bluetooth, and microwaves. 
It is capable of connecting 255 devices per network [6]. 
The data rate of ZigBee is 250 kbps at 2.4 GHz, 40 kbps at 915 MHz, and 
20 kbps at 868 MHz, whereas that of Bluetooth is 1 Mbps. ZigBee’s data rates 
are slower than 802.11b (11 Mbps) and Bluetooth (1 Mbps), but it consumes sig-
nificantly less power. The transmit power levels for 802.15.4 radios are very low, 
typically -3 dBm (0.5 mW). The receive sensitivity is -80 to -100 dBm, depending 
on the 802.15.4 radio. 
ZigBee allows small, low-cost devices to quickly transmit small amounts of data 
such as temperature readings for thermostats, on/off requests for light switches, or 
keystrokes for a wireless keyboard. ZigBee devices, typically battery-powered, can 
actually transmit information much farther than 20m (60 feet) because each device 
within listening distance passes the message along to any other device within range, 
and only the intended device acts upon the message.

ZigBee takes its name from the dance that honey bees use to communicate information about newly found 
food sources to other members of the colony. The ZigBee Alliance, which totals nearly 100 companies, 
including Honeywell, Mitsubishi, Motorola, Philips, and Samsung, is hoping to penetrate the home-auto-
mation market overwhelmed by a variety of other proprietary technologies.

Although a ZigBee-compatible device for could be used for medically implant-
ed wireless telemetry as well, there could be a few drawbacks. One is represented 
by the overheads included in the standardized devices that have to meet very broad 
market requirements. Furthermore, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard allocates most of 
the communication channels (16 out of 27) in the 2.45-GHz band. This frequency 
range is close to the resonance frequency of water molecules; therefore, this may 
severely affect the transmission efficiency from an implanted device, especially if 
placed in areas such as the stomach and the colon that are completely surrounded 
by living tissues. In addition, the power required to establish a reliable connection 
with an external unit may exceed the international regulatory levels for human 
safety.
In many ZigBee applications, the total time the wireless device is engaged in 
any type of activity is very limited; the device spends most of its time in a power-
saving mode, also known as a sleep mode. ZigBee networks are primarily intended 
for low-duty-cycle sensor networks (<1%). A new network node may be recog-
nized and associated in about 30 ms. Waking up a sleeping node takes about 15 
ms, as does accessing a channel and transmitting data. ZigBee applications benefit 
from the ability to quickly attach information, detach, and go into a deep sleep, 
which results in low power consumption and extended battery life. As a result, 
ZigBee-enabled devices are capable of being operational for several years before 
their batteries need to be replaced [7]. 
One Zigbee application is in-home patient monitoring in which a patient’s 
blood pressure and heart rate, for example, can be measured by wearable devices 
[8].
2.5  Wireless Body Area Networks
2.5.1  About Wireless Body Area Networks
So far we talked about WLANs and WPANs, and now we will focus on the wire-
less networks with the range of less than 1 foot, the wireless body area networks 
(WBANs). People with chronic disease and the elderly need effective personalized 
health monitoring and delivery and represents the primary motivation for the de-
velopment of BANs, sometimes also referred to as body sensor networks (BSNs).
Devices such as implantable biomedical systems will become really miniature 
computers that employ sensitive, low-voltage, low-power application-specific inte-
grated circuits (ASICs) to measure, monitor, and regulate physiological parameters 
and control the delivery of electrical impulses to different organs in the human 
body (Figure 2.8). The implanted medical devices and on-body sensors are mainly 
connected with monitoring tools to provide patient health data in real time using 
BANs. 
Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are already very successful in the treat-
ment of many diseases. By definition, an active implantable medical device (AIMD) 
is any active medical device that is intended to be totally or partially introduced, 
surgically or medically, into the human body or by medical intervention into a 
natural orifice, in which it is intended to remain after the procedure.

Short-Range Communications Systems
These days, the new ultralow-power RF technologies are part of the develop-
ment of innovative medical tools, from endoscopic camera capsules that are swal-
lowed to implanted devices that wirelessly transmit patient health data. Radio links 
between external programming devices (or base stations) and medical implants are 
critical to the success of IMDs and have been researched extensively [9].
The network can deliver services to the person using the WBAN, including the 
management of chronic disease, medical diagnostics, home monitoring, biometrics, 
and sports and fitness tracking [10]. A health care provider provides a service that 
automatically collects data from the patient, integrates the data into the patient’s 
medical record, processes the information, and issues recommendations, if neces-
sary. The patient’s electronic medical record is updated in real time. 
The exact location of the patient can be determined using GPS, and medical 
professionals can monitor the activity of the patient and issue new guidance based 
on the new information. Standard IEEE 11073 describes and regulates communi-
cation between medical, health care, and wellness devices and external computer 
systems.5

The ISO/IEEE 11073 Medical/Health Device Communication Standards is a group of ISO, IEEE, and 
CEN joint standards that address the interoperability of medical devices, enabling communication between 
medical, health care, and wellness devices and with external computer systems.

Continuous monitoring the life signs of patients and analyzing the signal pat-
terns enable early detection of the dangerous medical conditions and lead to more 
effective treatment and shorter hospital stays. In addition, long-term life-sign data 
could improve the quality of diagnoses when a person becomes ill. Many other 
applications of on-body sensor have been explored by research groups, and up-to-
date information on the new products and applications can be found on the Medi-
cal Connectivity Web site [11].
The body network is composed of tiny portable devices equipped with a variety 
of sensors (such as heart rate, heart rhythm, temperature, pulse oximeter,6 and ac-
celerometer sensors) and performs biophysical monitoring, patient identification, 
location detection, and other desired tasks [12]. The energy consumption of these 
miniature sensors is also optimized so that the battery does not need to be changed 
regularly; they may use kinetic recharging. 
Actuators notify the wearer of important messages from an external entity. For 
example, an actuator can remind an early-stage Alzheimer’s patient to check the 
oven because sensors detect an abnormally high temperature, or a tone may indi-
cate that it is time for the patient to take medication. A node in the body network is 
designated as the gateway to the emplaced sensor network. Due to size and energy 
constraints, nodes in this network have small processing and storage capabilities.
Today a number of other implants in use and in development, for example, 
brain pacemakers for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, implantable drug pumps, 
cochlea implants, artificial eyes, muscle stimulators and nerve-signal recorders for 
use with robotic prostheses, bladder control implants, pain control implants,7 and 
so forth. All of these implants need some kind of data transfer, either in one or two 
directions. Neither inductive nor RF is the best for all of them because the power 
requirements, range, and speed are different from application to application. 
In medical applications, the radio-communication link enables a clinician to re-
program therapy and obtain useful diagnostic information. The low-frequency in-
ductive links (introduced in the early 1970s) used to be the most prevalent method 
of communication, typically operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz range, 
and with data rates of 1–30 kbps. These low-power systems can accommodate a 
small coiled antenna in the IMD, and have proven to be robust and sufficiently reli-
able. Unfortunately, antenna size and power limitations in implants result in a very 
low magnetic field strength for an IMD communication with an external program-
mer, and therefore they have a short range. 
Using functional electrical stimulus (FES), implants can stimulate muscles or 
nerves in response to movement detected by sensors elsewhere on the body, allow-
ing a paralyzed patient to walk again. Similarly, a radio-controlled valve for the 
urinary tract is in development that will be operated on-demand to restore bladder 
control.

Hollywood comedian Jerry Lewis has suffered from chronic back pain (and addiction to pain killers) for 
many years until April 2001, when he received an implant. The pain pacemaker delivers low-voltage stimu-
lation to his spinal cord to block the pain messages from reaching his brain, so he no longer feels pain; his 
back problem still exists, but he is made to think it doesn’t.

In case of ventricular fibrillation, a common type of cardiac arrest, the impulses 
travel through the heart as little wavelets, causing unsynchronized tightening and 
releasing of the muscle fibers in the ventricles, the two lower chambers of the heart. 
Without proper synchronization, blood flow ceases; starved of oxygen, other or-
gans rapidly begin to fail, and within 10 minutes, the victim will almost certainly 
die. 
In 2008, EU approved the Biotronik home monitoring system (the late Profes-
sor Dr. Max Schaldach, the company founder, developed the first German cardiac 
pacemaker in 1963) that lets physicians keep tab on patients at home. As with its 
other systems, this one relies on the wireless network to send vital information 
to the patient’s physician. The system will work with a whole range of different 
implants, including pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and cardiac resynchro-
nization therapy devices [13]. 
In November 2010 the West Wireless Health Institute unveiled its new portable 
cardiotocography (electronic fetal monitoring) system. The device, which commu-
nicates either over cellular or a wireless LAN connection, should allow a physician 
to monitor fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions remotely [14].
In 2009, FDA approved a totally implanted brain stimulator intended to 
suppress symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)8 that 
are not  adequately controlled with medications and/or other therapies [15]. an  
implanted pulse generator (IPG) is connected with a lead extension to a lead with 
four electrodes. The electrodes contact the patient at a specific location within the 
brain. 
The pulse generator is implanted under the skin of either the abdomen or un-
der the clavicle, and sends programmable electrical stimulation pulses to a selected 
combination of output electrodes within the brain. Two of these device systems 
may be implanted to stimulate both sides of the brain in order to relieve symptoms 
or one device with two lead outputs.
2.5.2  Technical Challenges of Body Area Networks
Integrated communications from different in-body implants and on-body sensors 
will also allow hearing for the deaf, sight for the blind, and mobility for the dis-
abled. The objective is to design and manufacture intelligent medical devices that 
have communication capability and utilize the full range of advanced technologies 
in design, materials, processes and manufacturing [16]. 
To promote its widespread use, there are a number of technical challenges 
that need to be tackled, like the need for better sensor design, MEMS integration, 
biocompatibility, power source miniaturization, low-power wireless transmission, 
context awareness, secure data transfer, and integration with therapeutic systems. 
As radios decrease their cost and power consumption, it becomes feasible to embed

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a type of mental disorder in which an individual experiences obsessions, 
compulsions, or both. Either the obsessive thought or the compulsive act may occur alone, or both may 
appear in sequence. Obsessions are recurring or persistent thoughts, images, or impulses that invade a 
person’s consciousness despite attempts to ignore, suppress, or control them. Compulsions are urges (or 
impulses) to commit meaningless repetitive acts. Should the sufferer be forcibly or externally prevented 
from performing the compulsive act, he or she may experience an overwhelming anxiety.

them in more types of electronic devices, which can be used to create smart homes, 
sensor networks, and other new medical applications [17]. 
Microsensor devices are exposed to varied constraints that determine their size 
and capability (Table 2.1). For example, a body network device need not be espe-
cially small, but a medical implant often has size constraints that must be met. In 
addition, a wireless system designed to operate in close proximity to the human 
body must not exceed regulated power limits, usually at the expense of the range, 
especially if it is an implant. The constraints of the implanted wireless technology 
and the difficulties of the antenna design are described in [18]. 
In another example of implants described in [19], microfluidic systems allow 
analytical tools/sensors to complete assays more rapidly due to the relationship 
between size, diffusion, and time. 
With the increased sophistication of medical implants, there is a growing need 
for flexible high-speed communication with the implant from outside the body. Up 
until recently, communication was achieved strictly using an inductive link operat-
ing at a low carrier frequency. 
For example, a small coil is placed inside the case of the pacemaker, and a 
larger coil is placed upon the chest of the patient, directly on top of the pacemaker. 
The inductive coupling between these two coils is then used to transfer data to 
and from the pacemaker. The link is usually working at half-duplex meaning that 
transmission is in only one direction at any given time. The speed is typically low, 
a few hundred bits per second, and although the higher speeds are achievable, the 
low-carrier frequency limits the available data bandwidth severely.
Extended range and communication speed are possible to achieve by increasing 
the carrier frequency and the bandwidth; even the 2.45-GHz ISM band is a pos-
sibility, but has the drawback of being heavily used by other applications, such as 
wireless computer networks and microwave ovens. A number of advantages accrue 
if the communication with the implant can be moved to a higher carrier frequency. 
The first one is an increase in bandwidth, which makes it possible to achieve a high-
er bit rate. The second one is that a higher-frequency gives rise to a propagating 
electromagnetic wave, which makes the system usable at longer ranges. A longer 
communication range makes a number of new user scenarios possible. 
A key element of an RF-linked implant is the in-body antenna, which must 
meet stringent biocompatible and size-limit requirements. An implanted transceiver

also faces numerous RF challenges. Unlike free-air performance, the human body 
is often an unpredictable and hostile environment for a wireless signal. Improving 
therapy and diagnoses, an implanted pacemaker will regularly transmit perfor-
mance data and the patient’s condition to a doctor’s office. If the pacemaker detects 
a cardiac arrest, the device could signal to a base station to alert an emergency 
response team. 
2.5.3  Principle of Inductive Coupling 
2.5.3.1  Brief Description and Applications
The inductive link uses the phenomenon of mutual inductance of two coupled coils 
for energy transfer and data transmission utilizing the inductive near field [20]. 
In the past years, an electromagnetic link is the most common link used for com-
munication and to supply power to the implanted medical devices. Since the first 
pacemaker was implanted in the human body in 1958, all communication takes 
place through electromagnetic link. With the amplitude modulation their use can be 
expanded, for example, to the transmission of pulse trains for deep brain stimula-
tion (DBS). 
Implants have a small coil outside the small housing, while the external source 
has another coil and is placed on the skin of the patient directly above the implant. 
The inductive coupling between these two coils serves as the communication chan-
nel but with the range of only a few inches. External circuitry consists of a modula-
tor and a transmitter. Transmitter is usually designed using Class D or E power am-
plifier to provide maximum power with high efficiency. The internal (implanted) 
circuitry contains voltage regulator and a demodulator [21]. In addition, previous 
studies have shown that RF energy between 1 and 10 MHz penetrates the body 
with minimum energy loss.
Systems with two coils (one internally and one externally) effectively behave 
as the primary and secondary coils of a transformer. Detailed design and experi-
mentation have shown that such a system can communicate effectively over the 
required range (typically few inches) consuming less electrical power than a more 
conventional radio system [22]. Electromagnetic induction is an attractive option, 
as it not only reduces the power constraint on the device but also removes the need 
for batteries. 
The maximum power density permitted near the human body is in the region 
of 10 W/sq m but varies with frequency and differs from country to country [23]. 
2.5.3.2  Theory of Operation
In general, inductive coupling is the transfer of energy from one circuit to another 
through a shared magnetic field. An electrical current passing through the coil of a 
primary conductor creates a magnetic field that induces an electrical current in the 
coil of a secondary conductor exposed to the magnetic field. A complete inductive 
powering system consists of two major parts; a drive coil and a pickup coil, and 
their associated impedance matching networks. 
The drive coil (reader) is designed to maximize the magnetic field within the 
desired enclosure at the drive frequency. Similarly, the pickup coil (tag) is designed 

2.5  Wireless Body Area Networks 
33
to maximize the amount of magnetic flux density converted to power for the im-
plant, while minimizing its own dimensions. The following is description of the 
reader/tag operation that can be used in the telemetry system for implanted devices 
in humans or animals. 
Without getting into too many details, we can say that a transformer is a couple 
of coils of wire which transfer power from one to the other by a changing magnetic 
field. By having different numbers of windings, or turns of wire, a transformer can 
step up or step down an ac voltage. According to (2.16), the proportion of energy 
captured by the secondary coil can be represented by the coupling coefficient, k: 
	
1
2
M
k
L L
=
	
(2.16)
where k is the coefficient of coupling and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, L1 is the inductance of the first 
coil, L2 is the inductance of the second coil, and M is the mutual inductance.
Mutual inductance depends only on the geometry of the two coils and is inde-
pendent of the current in the coil. The coefficient of coupling is always between 0 
and 1, and is an important factor in the operation of any inductively coupled sys-
tem; k = 1 means that all of the magnetic flux produced by one coil passes through 
the other coil, which is practically never the case. In other words, this coefficient 
describes how closely linked the two inductors are magnetically; the better these 
two inductors are magnetically coupled, the more efficient the energy transfer be-
tween them should be. 
The basic principles behind transferring power and data through an inductive 
link are the same as those used in transformer circuits; the major difference here is 
that in this case the two coils are fairly weakly coupled (i.e., through the air). Typi-
cal values for k in inductively powered system, in a very close proximity of a few 
millimeters, are between 0.01 and 0.1. 
The coupling coefficient between the two coils, where the radius of the reader 
coil is much larger than radius of transponder (implanted) coil, can be determined 
empirically for the air-coupling case:

(2.17) 
Equation (2.17) is based on the radii of the two coils (aImplant and aReader) and 
the distance r between them (see sample calculation in the Table 2.2). We will as-
sume that the two coils are parallel (θ = 0°=> q = 1) and center aligned, with only 
air between the two coils. While not as accurate as finite element modeling, this still 
provides a good approximation of the system coupling coefficient [24]. 
This value can then be used in a simplified model of the complete inductively 
coupled system shown in Figure 2.9. 
The two windings of the transformer were labeled rather generically 1 and 2. It 
is also quite common to refer to the two windings as primary and secondary. This 
convention is often used when a generator is connected to a primary winding, and 

34 
����������������������������������
Short-Range Communications Systems
a load is connected to a secondary winding. In that case, the energy flow is into the 
primary and out of the secondary; however, all transformers are bidirectional, so 
there is nothing inherently primary about either of the two windings. 
The transformer turns ratio was indicated as n1:n2 or 1:n. Because the ideal 
transformer is a model for a real transformer, the numbers n1 and n2 may be the 
actual physical turns count of a transformer, such as 363:33. For circuit analysis 
purposes it is equivalent to give the turns ratio as 11:1, or as n = 1/11 = 0.0909. It 
might be noted that the turns ratio of a physical transformer is always a rational 
number, that is, the ratio of two integers. Therefore, a turns ratio of 
3 : 1  is not 
possible, although 173 turns and 100 turns on a physical transformer would do a 
good job of approximating it. 
The left side of this model represents the outside components of the system 
(reader), while the right side includes a basic model of the implanted system. Here, 
R1 represents the parasitic resistance in the coil, C1 is the tuning capacitance used 
to raise the coil voltage, and RL is the load on the system. The weakly coupled 
transformer is used here to represent the two discrete coils, L1 and L2. The primary 
(reader’s) coil, L1, is driven by an RF amplifier supplying current at frequency w. 
In the real system, RL is time varying and complex, while in this model it is repre-
sented as a real resistor.

In circuit analysis it is quite common to use the concept of an ideal transformer, 
which does not generate, dissipate, or store energy (Figure 2.10). Therefore, the 
instantaneous power leaving the transformer is the same as that entering. In other 
words, if one were to draw a box around an ideal transformer and sum the power 
flows in and out of the box, the result is zero at every moment in time.
According to the basic equations governing ideal transformer (i.e., the magne-
tizing current is negligibly small) behavior, the current out of the transformer, i2, is 
shown in here:

Impedance scaling property means that if a given impedance is connected to 
one winding of an ideal transformer, it will appear the same at the other winding 
scaled in magnitude by the turns ratio squared (n2). The impedance appears greater 
at the winding having the greater number of turns and smaller at the winding hav-
ing fewer turns. 
The impedance scaling property of an ideal transformer allows circuit elements 
to be moved from one winding to another by scaling their impedances according to 
the square of the transformer turns ratio. 
Now, the weakly coupled transformer can be replaced by an approximation 
(Figure 2.11). In this model, the new ratio n′ (actually, a transfer function) is ap-
proximated by:

Both the data signal and other external spurious magnetic fields are trans-
formed by the primary coil. The magnitude of these transformed voltages depends 
on the coil geometry. Generally speaking, increasing primary inductance L1 will 
cause an increasing influence of the external fields. With a low coupling coefficient 
k, the impedance seen by current i2 is approximately equal to that of an inductor 
with value k2L2 (the impedance of this inductor is much lower than that of the 
other inductor in the circuit, therefore, nearly all of the current will flow through 
this inductor). 
Using the impedance equation of the inductor at a known frequency, the volt-
age induced by this current is:

Here uT is the voltage induced by the current i1 across the L2 component of the 
transformer. We can now replace the weakly coupled transformer with a voltage 
source, uT, in series with an inductor. With a small k value, we can approximate the 
value of this inductor by L2 (Figure 2.12).
In this simplified case, a basic equation for the voltage across the load, u2, is 
given by:

Equation (2.24) makes use of the impedances of the various components at a 
known frequency of operation (UHF band). Substituting in the equation for the 
transformer voltage and solving for the real part of the solution leads to a final 
answer with respect to the known parameters of the system:

where we require u2 within a certain range and it depends on the distance between 
the two coils. Therefore, by changing the current through the primary coil of the 
system, the voltage on the implanted coil could be adjusted for a fixed coupling fac-
tor. This gives a required coil (rms) current on the order of 100 mA for the system 
with weak coupling. 
Inductive coupling has many different applications as implanted electronic cir-
cuits, RFID, or even as a low-cost, low-power, high-bandwidth interface for inter-
connection of the modules on the chip [25].

2.5.4  Medical Implant Communication Service and Wireless Medical 
Telemetry Service Bands
2.5.4.1  MICS Development and Relevant Standards
As shown earlier, inductive links are short range and often require the external 
programmer to have contact with the skin of the patient directly over the implant. 
To overcome these operating-range and low-data-rate limitations, new ultralow-
power RF technologies are being developed that operate at much higher frequen-
cies, such as in the 433- and 915-MHz ISM bands and the more recently allocated 
402–405-MHz Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) band. RF inte-
grated circuit technology can now offer low-power, reduced external component 
count and higher levels of integration, which will open new markets for medical 
device manufacturers.
From a regulatory viewpoint, the establishment of the MICS band began in the 
mid-1990s when Medtronic petitioned the FCC to allocate of spectrum dedicated 
to medical implant use. After gaining wider industry support, the 402–405-MHz 
MICS band was recommended for allocation by ITU-R Recommendation SA1346 
in 1998. The FCC established the band in 1999, and similar standards followed in 
Europe.
The MICS band, located in the frequency range of 402–405 MHz, is reserved 
specifically for wireless data communications between implanted medical devices 
and external equipment. The FCC set aside this band because the signal-propaga-
tion characteristics in the band are particularly well suited for implantable appli-
cations, due to signal propagation characteristics in the human body, the relative 
dearth of other users in the band, and the ability to use the band internationally. 
The MICS use of this band is secondary to the primary users of this spectrum (i.e., 
Meteorological Aids Service, the Meteorological Satellite Services, and the Earth 
Satellite Service). 
MICS band has general worldwide acceptance and has been approved in the 
United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan [26]. In addition, since the 
device’s primary purpose is therapeutic, the communication link is used about 
0.005% of the time, further limiting its interference potential. 
The common standards should allow patients with implantable devices to ob-
tain care in the United States and Europe. Relevant MICS standards could be found 
in FCC and ETSI documents [27–29].
The MICS standard is set by ETSI EN 301 839-1 but Specific Absorption Rate 
(SAR)9 levels are not specified there; instead, safety limits can be taken from the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) [30]. 
MICS in Canada is regulated through RSS-243, “Active Medical Implant Com-
munications System Devices in the 402–405 MHz Band,” and these devices are 
defined as Category I equipment as per RSS-Gen. Devices certified under this stan-
dard are classified as Category I equipment and a Technical Acceptance Certificate 
(TAC), issued by the Certification and Engineering Bureau of Industry Canada, or 
a certificate issued by a recognized Certification Body (CB) is required. 
9.	
Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the body when 
exposed to an RF electromagnetic field (i.e., power absorbed per mass of tissue), expressed in watts per 
kilogram (W/kg).

2.5  Wireless Body Area Networks 
39
Insuring the flexibility and scope of potential uses under this new service, the 
FCC proposed to revise its nomenclature and designate the entire 401–406-MHz 
band as MedRadio service. To accommodate a wider variety of devices than the 
current MICS service, which is limited to use of implant devices, the FCC proposed 
allowing the use of body-worn transmitting devices in the MedRadio service.
There are two principal fields of application for the MICS standard. The first 
one is for communication between a base station and an implanted device and the 
second one is for communication between medical implants within the same body. 
There is also a third possible use, rarely discussed, and that is the communication 
between medical implants in different bodies; this application is today fairly far-
fetched but there are possible applications, such as mesh networking in order to 
increase the effective communication range.
2.5.4.2  Technical Characteristics of MICS
Technical rules were established to minimize interference and ensure safe coex-
istence of multiple MICS devices. The maximum transmitting power is very low, 
EIRP = 25 μW (-16 dBm), in order to reduce the risk of interfering with other users 
of the same band. The MICS band is broken into 300-kHz-wide channels. The rules 
specify that devices must listen for other devices before transmitting, called Listen-
before-talk (LBT). If interference is encountered, the radio switches channels and 
listens again, a process known as frequency agility. 
The rules also allow MICS devices to transmit without prior frequency moni-
toring in response to a non-RF actuation signal generated by a device external to 
the body (i.e., manual activation) or in response to a medical implant event (i.e., 
alert or alarm condition). 
The MICS regulations require the system to perform a Clear-channel Assess-
ment (CCA) in which the user scans all 10 of the 300-kHz channels and is al-
lowed to transmit on the channel with the lowest ambient signal level (the least 
noisy channel). The user can also choose to transmit on the first available channel 
with an ambient power below a certain threshold (as defined in the standard). The 
MICS standard requires that the external programmer carry out the scanning pro-
cess. For this reason, the IMD transceiver should support a low-power method of 
sniffing for the presence of an external programmer signal. 
MICS regulations provide an exception to the CCA procedure in the event 
of an emergency medical event. For clinically significant medical emergencies, the 
IMD may transmit immediately on any channel. For example, if an implanted ECG 
monitor or pacemaker detects a cardiac arrest, the device could transmit immedi-
ately to a monitoring base station that, in turn, calls an emergency response service.
There is a growing need for implants, particularly heart implants, to commu-
nicate over greater distances than the current rules allow. The power permitted 
under MICS accommodates, at most, 6 to 8 feet of separation. For instance, it is 
increasingly difficult, if not impractical, to position implant monitoring equipment 
near patients in operating environments when physicians and nurses require unre-
stricted access to patients at all times. In addition, in operating theaters, implant 
monitoring equipment must be located outside the sterile field, which often means 
an estimated 30 feet or more between implant and reader. Furthermore, where mul-
tiple patients reside in a common areas (e.g., nursing homes, hospital wards, and so 

40 
����������������������������������
Short-Range Communications Systems
forth), independent sessions with individual patients become increasingly economi-
cal and convenient as the distance between implants and programmers increases. 
The main problem with MICS is that the spectrum currently allocated to MICS 
may not be insufficient to support the variety of implants and data rates being 
demanded by doctors (and patients) in the years ahead. Because of the reliance on 
spectrum for functionality of medical devices, and in anticipation of even greater 
usage, the FCC initiated a proceeding to make more spectrum available for medical 
devices. 
2.5.4.3  Wireless Medical Telemetry Service
Wireless medical telemetry service (WMTS) enables monitoring equipment to re-
motely and unobtrusively observe several patients at one time. Such telemetry sys-
tems transmit real-time physiologic data, so it is critical to ensure that data are not 
lost or delayed. 
Increasingly more radios for nonmedical applications are operating in the 
ISM bands, increasing the likelihood of signal loss and interference. In response to 
growing concerns about interference resulting from new digital television transmit-
ters, low power television transmitters, and greater use of private land mobile radio 
equipment, the FCC established the WMTS, dedicating bands of frequencies for 
interference-free operation of medical telemetry systems. 
This is the only frequency spectrum designated strictly for medical telemetry 
systems and neither video nor voice transmission is permitted; all transmitters op-
erating in the WMTS bands must be registered in the database to ensure interfer-
ence-free operation. Authorized health care providers, who desire to use wireless 
medical telemetry devices, before starting the operation must register all devices 
with a designated frequency coordinator [31].
The WMTS bands are 608–614 MHz, 1,395–1,400 MHz, and 1,427–1,432 
MHz. All transmitters operating in the WMTS bands must be registered in the da-
tabase to ensure interference-free operation. Prior to operation, authorized health 
care providers who desire to use wireless medical telemetry devices must register all 
devices with a designated frequency coordinator.
The 608–614-MHz band is shared with the radio astronomy service. There are 
13 radio astronomy sites located throughout the United States. These sites have a 
protected radius of up to 50 miles. If the proposed WMTS deployment should fall 
within the protected radius of any of these sites, it is necessary to coordinate with 
the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
The 1,395–1,400 MHz is shared with military radar systems. There are 17 ra-
dar sites located throughout the United States; these systems can have a protected 
radius of up to 55 miles. If the proposed WMTS deployment should fall within the 
protected radius of any of these sites, it is necessary to coordinate with the NTIA. 
FCC excluded WMTS equipment from home use as well as the use of WMTS 
equipment in vehicles, including ambulances, due to potential interference issues. 
It would be difficult to ensure that WMTS equipment operated in ambulances or 
other vehicles would not interfere with other WMTS equipment operating on the 
same or adjacent frequencies at fixed sites in hospitals and health care facilities 
within the area passed by the ambulance. 

2.5  Wireless Body Area Networks 
41
Additional requirement for all WMTS transmitters that operate within 8 inches 
of a person’s body (portable WMTS transmitters, for example) is that they must 
be routinely evaluated to demonstrate compliance with the FCC’s RF radiation ex-
posure guidelines. However, WMTS transmitters that operate at 8 inches or more 
from a patient’s body are not required to undergo routine evaluation to demon-
strate RF exposure compliance. Mobile WMTS transmitters are designed to nor-
mally operate with a separation distance of at least 8 inches from the radiating 
structures of a device and a patient’s body. 
Typically, medical telemetry devices are worn on the body of the patient, so it 
is expected that most WMTS transmitters will be classified as portable transmitters 
and will therefore be required to demonstrate RF exposure compliance with respect 
to the SAR limit as specified in 47 CFR 2.1093. 
In some situations, the WMTS transmitter is mounted on a patient bed or 
incorporated within a separate device that is more than 8 inches away from the 
patient and nearby persons and in those cases, the WMTS transmitter will not be 
required to undergo routine evaluation to demonstrate RF exposure compliance. 
Due to relatively low transmitter power (less than 1.5-W EIRP) and the separation 
distance between the transmitter and the body of persons, the potential for mobile 
WMTS devices to exceed RF exposure limits is remote.
2.5.5  Passive Wearable Electrostatic Tags
Passive wearable electrostatic tags, also called body tags, have also been under 
development for some time. The wearable tag exploits the human body’s natural 
ability to conduct electric fields and allows the wearer to present tags to tag readers 
through natural motions such as the grasp of a doorknob or the push of a button. 
The tag and reader imbue the user’s physical gesture with digital meaning [32]. The 
body tag is also less expensive than other conventional inductive tags because it 
contains no magnetic flux coupling coil. The body may be modeled as a conductor 
surrounded by an insulator. Power and data signals may be coupled electrostatically 
to the body’s interior and sent through it. 
The human body acts as a poor conductor connecting the tag and the reader 
(Figure 2.13). However, displacement current, not dc current, passes through the 
user’s body allowing the tag and reader to exchange data and power through the 
body. We call this type of communication intrabody signaling. At low frequencies, 
the human body appears to be a capacitive load; at higher frequencies the body ra-
diates RF energy. It is possible to send power and data through the body by capaci-
tively coupling displacement current into the body and using the ambient ground 
reference provided by our environment as the current return path. 
The human body is modeled as a solid ideal conductor (the briny interior) sur-
rounded by an ideal insulator (the skin). It is not a good idea to send dc current 
through the body because it is surrounded by an insulator, not to mention that it 
could be hazardous to present a constant voltage drop across the interior of the 
body. However, ac current can be sent through the body by capacitively coupling to 
its interior and using it as a single low-impedance node in a network of capacitors.
Each of these capacitances is on the order of 10 to 100 pF. Note that body 
couples to one electrode on the tag, while the tag’s other electrode couples to the 
ambient ground. If we put the body tag into the shoe, these electrodes could be the

top and the bottom of an inserted pad. Generally speaking, wireless body-centric 
networks consist of a number of nodes and units placed on the human body or in 
close proximity, such as on everyday clothing. Currently, it is used to receive or 
transmit simple information which requires very low processing capabilities. 
However, some high-performance and complex units are needed in the future 
to provide the facilities for powerful computational processing with high data rates, 
for applications such as video streaming and heavy data communications. These 
have led to increasing research and development activities in the field of body area 
network applications for many purposes, with the main interest being health care 
and patient monitoring and task-specific/fully compatible wearable body networks 
(e.g., wearable computers) that have been applied in fields such as construction and 
medicine. 
There are three primary criteria for wireless modules for wireless body-centric 
networks. First, they must support high data rates. Second, they must be small, 
both of which suggest the use of high frequencies. Third, they must consume a 
minimum of power, which implies highly efficient links. In terms of antennas and 
propagation, efficient design requires good understanding of the properties of the 
propagation channel involved and the development of optimized antennas.
2.6  Ultrawideband Technology
2.6.1  Ultrawideband Description
Ultrawideband (UWB) is a recently approved technology which relies on extremely 
short pulses that generate signals with very wide bandwidths, sometimes up to sev-
eral gigahertz. UWB signals go undetected by most conventional receivers, minimiz-
ing their threat as harmful interferers. UWB technologies are currently being used 
in a variety of applications, such as ground penetrating radar, and are likely to be 
used in a variety of emerging applications, such as through-wall imaging and high-
speed data transmission.

Gerald F. Ross first demonstrated the feasibility of UWB waveforms for radar 
and communications applications in the late 1960s and early 1970s [33]. Originally 
developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the tech-
nology was called baseband, carrier-free, impulse communications or time-domain 
signaling, until the U.S. Department of Defense named it ultrawideband in 1989. 
UWB radios are extremely wideband radios with very high potential data rates 
(Figure 2.14). The concept of ultrawideband communications actually originated 
with Marconi’s spark gap transmitter, which occupied a very wide bandwidth. 
However, because only a single low-rate user could occupy the spectrum, wide-
band communications was abandoned in favor of more efficient communication 
techniques. 
The renewed interest in wideband communications was spurred by the FCC’s 
decision in 2002 to allow operation of UWB devices, as system underplayed be-
neath existing users, using over 7 GHz of bandwidth. These systems can operate in 
the 3.1–10.6-GHz range. 
FCC defines UWB as any signal that occupies more than 500 MHz in the 3.1–
10.6-GHz band and that meets the spectrum mask. Given the recent spectral allo-
cation and the new definition of UWB adopted by the FCC, UWB is not considered 
a technology anymore, but available spectrum for license-exempt use. This means 
that any transmission signal that meets the FCC requirements for UWB spectrum 
can be considered UWB technology. This, of course, is not just restricted to impulse 
radios or high-speed spread-spectrum radios pioneered by companies so far, but to 
any technology that utilizes more than 500-MHz spectrum in the allowed spectral 
mask and with the current emission limit’s restrictions.
In theory, the system could interfere with all the systems in that frequency 
range, including critical safety and military systems, license-exempt systems such as 
802.11 wireless and Bluetooth, and cellular systems where operators paid billions 
of dollars for dedicated spectrum use. The FCC’s ruling was quite controversial 
given the vested interest in interference-free spectrum of these users. To minimize 
the impact of UWB on primary band users, the FCC put in place severe transmit 
power restrictions. This requires UWB devices to be within close proximity of their 
intended receiver [34].

Short-Range Communications Systems
There are two common forms of UWB: one is based on sending very short 
duration pulses to convey information, and the other uses multiple simultaneous 
carriers. Each approach has its relative technical merits and demerits. The most 
common form of multicarrier modulation, OFDM, has become the leading modu-
lation for high-data-rate systems, and much information on this modulation type is 
available in recent technical literature. 
Pure impulse radio, unlike classic communications, does not use a modulated 
sinusoidal carrier to convey information. Instead, the transmit signal is a series of 
baseband pulses. Because the pulses are extremely short (commonly in the nanosec-
ond range or shorter), the transmitted signal bandwidth is in the order of gigahertz. 
2.6.2  UWB Technical Specifications
UWB radios come with unique advantages that have long been appreciated by the 
radar and communications communities. Their wideband nature allows UWB sig-
nals to easily penetrate through obstacles and provides very precise ranging capa-
bilities. Moreover, the available UWB bandwidth has the potential for very high 
data rates. Finally, the power restrictions dictate that the devices can be small with 
low-power consumption. 
Initial UWB systems used ultrashort pulses with simple amplitude or position 
modulation. Multipath can significantly degrade performance of such systems, and 
proposals have been suggested to mitigate the effects of multipath equalization and 
multicarrier modulation. Precise and rapid synchronization is also a big challenge 
for these systems. Although many technical challenges remain, the appeal of UWB 
technology has sparked great interest both commercially and in the research com-
munity to address these issues. 
UWB has several features that differentiate it from conventional narrowband 
systems:
•• Large instantaneous bandwidth enables fine time resolution for network time 
distribution, precision location capability, or use as radar.
•• Short duration pulses are able to provide robust performance in dense mul-
tipath environments by exploiting more resolvable paths.
•• Low power spectral density allows coexistence with existing users and has a 
Low Probability of Intercept (LPI).
•• Data rate may be traded for power spectral density and multipath 
performance.
On February 14, 2002, the FCC issued a First Report and Order, which classi-
fied UWB operation into three separate categories, and each category was allocated 
a specific spectral mask:
1.	 Communication and measurement systems;
2.	 Vehicular radar systems;
3.	 Imaging systems, including ground penetrating radar, through-wall imag-
ing and surveillance systems, and medical imaging.

2.6  Ultrawideband Technology

The FCC ruling, however, did not specifically address precision location for 
asset tracking or inventory control. These applications, known as location-aware 
communication systems, are a hybrid of radar and data communications that use 
UWB pulses to track the 2-D and 3-D position of an item to accuracies within a few 
tens of centimeters, as well as transmitting information about the item, such as its 
contents, to a centralized database system. The FCC has only specified a spectral 
mask and has not restricted users to any particular modulation scheme. 
As discussed previously, a number of organizations are promoting multicarrier 
techniques, such as Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing (OFDM), as a 
potential alternative for high-data-rate communications. Beyond the United States, 
other countries have been using a similar approach toward licensing UWB technol-
ogy; in both Europe and Japan, initial studies have been completed, and regulations 
are expected to be issued in the near future that are expected to harmonize with 
the FCC mask.
UWB systems are approved for license-exempt use within the United States 
under FCC Part 15, specifically Subpart F and Part 15.250, permitting both indoor 
and outdoor use. The FCC Part 15.250 band spans from 5,925–7,250 GHz. 
In March 2007, the European Commission (EC) formally adopted a UWB fre-
quency range from 3.4 to 4.8 GHz and 6 to 8.5 GHz, for use in EC member 
countries, which will establish several frequency limitations requiring UWB ven-
dors to alter their technology to meet those limits. The EC decision designates the 
frequency bands of 3.4 to 4.8 GHz and 6 to 8.5 GHz for use by UWB RFID tags 
and interrogators, as well as for other applications, such as data networking. UWB 
devices utilizing frequencies between 4.2 GHz and 4.8 GHz were permitted only 
until December 31, 2010, after which time they had to be converted to the 6- to 
8.5-GHz band.
2.6.3  UWB Medical Applications
In recent years, many proposals have been made to address the privacy and security 
issues of the WLAN and RFID systems. One of the proposals is to implement the 
link using UWB communications, since the use of an advanced modulation scheme 
offers a new approach to the security [35]. By using the modulation spreading code 
as a secret parameter of the communications link, it is possible to make eavesdrop-
ping extremely difficult and therefore increase the communication reliability. 
Recently, a UWB-based data link has been reported in biomedical applications 
to transmit data since it can offer low-power consumption, low signal power spec-
trum density, high data rate, and immunity against power interference and noise. To 
optimize receiver structures and antennas for UWB WBANs with respect to energy 
efficiency and complexity, the distinct features of the body area network channel 
have to be considered. Thus, it is necessary to know the propagation mechanisms 
in the proximity of the human body. Research in [36] is limited to transmission at 
the head, especially focusing on the link between both ears, and considers direct 
transmission, surface waves, reflections, and diffraction as possible propagation 
mechanisms. 
The use of UWB radio in RFID/BAN systems could bring significant benefits; 
for example, reduced risk of interfering with sensitive medical equipment in hos-

pital/health care applications, and very precise positioning of the person. These 
proposals and ideas are still under development.
2.6.4  Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing 
The basic idea behind OFDM is the use of a large number of parallel narrowband 
subcarriers instead of a single wideband carrier to transport information. OFDM 
refers to the use, by a single transmitter, of a set of frequency multiplexed signals 
with the exact minimum frequency spacing needed to make them orthogonal so 
that they do not interfere with each other. 
The advantages are that such a system is very efficient in dealing with multipa-
th and robust again narrowband interference. Disadvantages include sensitivity to 
frequency offset and phase noise and peak-to-average problem reduces the power 
efficiency of RF amplifier at the transmitter. 
Multicarrier communications were first used in the late 1950s and early 1960s 
for higher data-rate high-frequency military communications. Since that time, 
OFDM has emerged as a special case of multicarrier modulation using densely 
spaced subcarriers and overlapping spectra, and was patented in the United States 
in 1970. However, the technique did not become practical until several innova-
tions occurred. Fortunately, the apparently very complex processes of modulating 
(and demodulating) thousands of carriers simultaneously are equivalent to discrete 
Fourier transform operations, for which efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) al-
gorithms exist. Thus, integrated circuit implementations of OFDM demodulators 
are feasible for affordable mass-produced receivers. 
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, other practical issues in OFDM implemen-
tation were addressed, such as oscillator stability in the transmitter and receiver, 
linearity of the power amplifiers, and compensation of channel effects. Doppler 
spreading caused by rapid time variations of the channel can cause interference be-
tween the carriers and held back the development of OFDM until the development 
of a coded multicarrier modulation.
The concept of using parallel data transmission by means of frequency division 
multiplexing (FDM) was published in mid-1960s, while some early development 
can be traced back to the 1950s. A U.S. patent was filled and issued in January 
1970. The idea was to use parallel data streams and FDM with overlapping sub-
channels to avoid the use of high-speed equalization, to combat impulsive noise 
and multipath distortion, and to fully use the available bandwidth. The initial ap-
plications were in the military communications. 
In the telecommunications field, the terms of discrete multitone (DMT), mul-
tichannel modulation, and multicarrier modulation (MCM) are widely used, and 
sometimes they are interchangeable with OFDM. In OFDM, each carrier is or-
thogonal to all other carriers (see Figure 2.15); however, this condition is not al-
ways maintained in MCM. We could say that the OFDM is an optimal version of 
multicarrier transmission schemes.
OFDM is also used in asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) Services, digi-
tal audio broadcast (DAB), digital terrestrial television broadcast (DVB) in Europe, 
Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB) in Japan, IEEE 802.11a/g, 802.16a, 
and power line networking (HomePlug). Because OFDM is suitable for high-data-

rate systems, it is also being utilized in the fourth generation (4G) wireless services, 
IEEE 802.11n (high-speed WLAN) and IEEE 802.20 (MAN).
2.7  Review Questions and Problems
1.	 List some of the most unusual applications of the wireless technology you 
have encountered. Describe the principle of operation, frequencies, and po-
tential issues that users might face right now and in the future. 
2.	 A 75Ω load is connected to a transmission line with the characteristic im-
pedance of 50Ω. What is the VSWR at the load terminals? (Answer: 1.5.)
3.	 Calculate the wavelength of the signals that have a frequency of 125 kHz, 
13.56 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz. (Answer: 2.4 km, 22.2 m, 0.328 m, 
and 0.125 m.)
4.	 Although widely accepted as an inventor of radio, Guglielmo Marconi, 
an Italian engineer working in England, based his work on patents and 
inventions of Nikola Tesla. Tesla was an inventor of (among other things) 
alternate current, used today in every household (Figure 2.16). 
	
  In 1911, Tesla refused to share a Nobel Prize in Physics for the inven-
tion of radio transmission with Marconi. Tesla’s patents from 1900 were 
reversed in favor of Marconi in 1904 after large private investments (in-
cluding Edison) were made in Marconi’s company. In 1943, the U.S. Su-

preme Court upheld Tesla’s radio patent from 1900, and, as it stands today, 
Nikola Tesla is an official inventor of radio. 
	
  Although he is often nearly forgotten, Tesla held over 700 patents, and 
those patent are still valid. Write an essay describing the productive and 
very dynamic life of a genius and eccentric, Nikola Tesla. 
5.	 Although it is possible to continually increase the transmitting power of a 
system in order to achieve a path of any length, it is not necessarily desir-
able to do so. As the transmit power of a system increases, the potential of 
the system to cause interference to other services also increases, which lim-
its the use of spectrum in geographically adjacent areas. It is necessary to 
find a balance between the need of one user for increased power for his or 
her system and the need of another user for access to a channel to establish 
a service. 
	
  During the 1920s, radio communication was a veritable free-for-all; any-
one possessing radio equipment was allowed to broadcast signals over the 
air, resulting in chaos. Because interference resulted any time several trans-
mitters operated in near proximity, no one could be assured of reliable 
communications. By the early 1930s, radio sales and usage plummeted, 
and the market failure created by this chaos predestined today’s regulatory 
environment. Accordingly, with the passage of the Communications Act of 
1934, Congress created the Federal Communications Commission to regu-
late radio communications in the United States, the District of Columbia, 
and all U.S. possessions [37]. The FCC has historically controlled access to 
radio spectrum by allocating specific frequency bands for use by licensed 
service providers. 
	
  Today, many applications take advantage of the so-called license-exempt 
frequency bands. Research different applications and describe advantag-
es and disadvantages of the wide use of these (license-exempt) frequency 
bands. Show your results in a form of a table and briefly summarize your 
findings.
6.	 Verify whether the following two statements are correct and justify the 
answer:
•	 A horizontally positioned, linearly polarized receiver antenna is unlikely 
to capture any of the energy emitted by a vertically positioned, linearly 
polarized transmitter antenna. 
•	 A circularly polarized transmitter antenna will be able to communicate 
with any receiver antenna, regardless of its orientation.
7.	 List some of the ethical issues in the modern wireless (E911, for example) 
communications systems. Discuss the topic looking from different points 
of view (for example, an engineer, philosopher, doctor, clergyperson, politi-
cian, stay-at-home parent, or businessperson). 
8.	 UWB, a technology that was recently approved by the FCC for a number of 
communications and sensing applications, is a signaling method that relies 
on short pulses that create extremely wide bandwidths. In addition to their 
potential for communications systems, UWB technology can also support 
the operation of new low-power radar products that can provide precise

measurement of distances or detection of objects underground or behind 
walls or other structures. 
	
  Find at least three suppliers of commercial systems based on the UWB 
technology. Describe their products and systems.
9.	 If you were a person in charge of the decision whether wireless human 
body implants should continue to be developed and used on people, what 
would you decide? Can you justify your decision in a way to be acceptable 
to all of the people all of the times?
10.	What factors determine the range of a wireless link? Discuss the influence 
of each individual factor.
11.	How would you shape a wire of fixed length to obtain the greatest and the 
smallest inductance?
12.	There are many types of antenna radiation patterns, but the most common 
are omnidirectional, pencil beam, fan beam, and shaped beam. Discuss 
them in more detail and find examples of applications. More useful infor-
mation can be found in [38].

Automatic Identification Systems
The technologies used in the world of automatic identification and data capture 
(AIDC) are varied and often used in combinations to provide a broader base of 
information flow. This chapter attempts to summarize the technologies in common 
use today and give the reader a basic understanding of the technology and its uses 
and limitations.
3.1  Bar Codes
Perhaps the oldest of the AIDC technologies, bar code technology, can be looked 
upon as the best-known and probably the most successful to date. We are all famil-
iar with the basic bar code on a box of cereal or the jar of honey that we buy in the 
supermarket. This bar code is called UPC/EAN and is but one variation of over 250 
bar codes that have been designed over time. Bar codes like this are referred to as 
linear bar codes, as they are made up of a collection of bars and spaces side by side 
(Figure 3.1). Most of these barcodes have never gained broad acceptance and we 
usually only consider maybe a dozen of linear barcodes. 
Typical data content capacity varies from 8 to 30 characters with some bar 
codes restricted to numerals only and others using full alphanumeric information. 
Linear bar codes are used in many applications where the use of a simple nu-
meric or alphanumeric code can provide the key to a database of product. The 
most obvious limitation is the amount of data that can be stored in a linear bar 
code, though other problems can exist with the substrate on which the bar code is 
printed. The substrate might provide insufficient contrast or poor ink receptivity, 
which can cause the quality of the bar code to be less than ideal.
A new growth area in the world of bar codes is the 2-D version. Several varia-
tions of 2-D bar codes are available, but because these do not all comprise bars 
and spaces, the more accurate name of 2-D symbologies is used. Two-dimensional 
symbologies provide a means of storing large amounts of data in a very small 
space. Stacked symbologies (linear bar codes stacked on top of each other), ma-
trix symbologies (comprising a matrix of light and dark elements, circles, squares, 
or hexagons), and packet symbologies (a collection of linear symbols “random-
ly” arranged on a page) are commonly used. Examples of the three types include 
PDF417, Code 49, Code 16K (stacked), Code One, MaxiCode, Data Matrix, Aztec 
Code, QR Code (matrix), and Super Code (packet).

Two-dimensional symbologies have a major advantage over linear bar codes. 
They can store vast amounts of data. Individual symbols can store as much as 
7,000 numeric-only or 4,200 alphanumeric characters. Many of the symbologies 
also have the ability to use a device called structured append that allows messages 
to be split over multiple symbols, providing almost infinite storage space. 
The disadvantage of the 2-D symbologies is that a special scanner is needed. 
Matrix symbologies need a vision-based scanner to read the data, though some of 
the stacked symbologies can be read with a special laser scanner. 
3.2  Card Technologies 
3.2.1  Magnetic Cards
The first magnetic stripe cards were used in the early 1960s on transit tickets and 
in the 1970s for bank cards. Since then, the use of magnetic stripes continued to 
grow. Credit cards were first issued in 1951, but it was not until the establishment 
of standards in 1970 that the magnetic stripe became a factor in the use of the cards. 
Whether the card is a credit card-sized plastic card, a thin paper ticket, or an airline 
boarding card, the uses for magnetic stripe technology have grown considerably. 
Today with an infrastructure that encompasses every store in the high street 
giving them an ability to read the information on the magnetic stripe, the technol-
ogy is everywhere. Although some limitations exist on the amount of information 
that can be stored on the stripe and the security of the data, solutions from various 
vendors exist to solve these problems.
With the advent of new technologies, many people have predicted the demise 
of the magnetic stripe. However, with the investment in the current infrastructure, 
this is not likely to be any time soon. Magnetic stripe technology provides the ideal 
solution because it is very inexpensive and readily adaptable to many functions, 
meaning that it will still be used for many years to come. 
3.2.2  Smart Cards
Smart cards are not new; they were invented in 1974 by French journalist Roland 
Moreno [1] and first used as prepaid phone cards in 1984. Smart cards are credit 
card–sized pieces of plastic containing a data storage system. The technology was 
rapidly accepted in Europe because the high cost of telecommunications made on-
line verification of transactions very expensive. The smart card provided the mecha-
nism to move that verification off-line, reducing the cost without sacrificing any of 
the security. 
Figure 3.1  Linear and two-dimensional (2-D) bar codes.

3.2  Card Technologies

The first plastic cards were used in the United States for club membership, as 
calling cards after that, and finally as credit cards. Several terms are used to identify 
cards with integrated circuits embedded in them. The terms chip card, integrated 
circuit card, and smart card really all refer to the same thing. 
There are two types of smart card. The first type only contains memory and 
is used to store information; examples of this might include stored value cards in 
which the memory stores a dollar value that the user can spend in a variety of trans-
actions, such as in pay phones, retail bills, or vending machines. 
The second type of card is a true smart card in which a microprocessor is em-
bedded in the card along with memory. Now the card actually has the ability to 
make decisions about the data stored on the card. The card is not dependent on 
the unit to which it is attached to make the application work. Because the card 
contains a microprocessor, various methods can be used to prevent access to the 
information on the card, providing a secure environment. This security has been 
touted as the main reason that smart cards will replace other card technologies.
The microprocessor type smart card comes in two types: the contact version 
and the contactless version. Both types of cards are embedded with microproces-
sors; however, the contactless version does not have the gold-plated contacts visible 
on the card. The contactless card uses a technology to pass data between the card 
and the reader without any physical contact being made. The advantage to this 
contactless system is that there are no contacts to wear out, no chance of an electric 
shock coming through the contacts and destroying the integrated circuit, and the 
knowledge that the components are completely embedded in the plastic with no 
external connections. The disadvantage to this is that the card and reader are more 
complex and hence are more expensive. 
The biggest disadvantage today with smart cards is the cost to create a smart-
card system. Individual card prices have fallen over the past few years, but they are 
still high when compared with a magnetic stripe card. The biggest advantage is, 
of course, the amount of data that can be stored and the security that can be built 
into the card. 
3.2.3  Optical Cards
Optical memory cards use a technology similar to the one used for music CDs or 
CD-ROMs. A panel of the gold-colored laser sensitive material is laminated in the 
card and is used to store the information. The material is comprised of several lay-
ers that react when a laser light is directed at them. The laser burns a tiny hole (2.25 
µm in diameter) in the material, which can then be sensed by a low-power laser 
during the read cycle. The presence or absence of the burn spot indicates a 1 or a 0. 
Because the material is actually burned during the write cycle, the media is a 
write-once, read-many (WORM) media, and the data is nonvolatile (not lost when 
power is removed). The optical card can currently store between 4 and 6.6 MB of 
data which gives the ability to store graphical images such as photographs, logos, 
fingerprints, X-rays, and so forth. 
The major disadvantage of the optical card is the fact that it is a write-once 
technology, so the amount of data storage available is used up with every piece of 
new data written. In some applications, this can be considered an advantage be-
cause it maintains the complete history of changes made to the card.

3.3  Radio Frequency Identification
3.3.1  RFID Historic Background
The beginning of the RFID was in October 1948 after the paper by Harry Stock-
man, “Communications by Means of Reflected Power.” The popular system Iden-
tification of Friend of Foe (IFF) for aircraft was one of the first applications of 
the RFID [2]. In early 1940s, the British Royal Air Force outfitted airplanes with 
radio transponders that would respond when interrogated. This allowed pilots 
and ground crews to distinguish the RAF airplanes from the Luftwaffe’s airplanes, 
which proved to be a decisive advantage in the Battle of Britain. 
In 1960s, the electromagnetic theory related to the RFID application was de-
veloped, and this was the prelude to the RFID explosion. Commercial activities 
exploiting the RFID began also during the 1960s and the Electronic Article Surveil-
lance (EAS) application is one example. The EAS is a simple 1-bit tag, because only 
the presence or the absence of a tag can be detected. 
During the rapid development of microelectronic technology during the 1970s, 
companies, universities, and government laboratories were actively engaged in the 
development of practical applications of RFID, such as animal tracking, vehicle 
tracking, and factory automation. The 1980s was the decade for mass deployment 
of RFID technology. The interest in the United States was mainly for transportation 
and access control whereas in Europe the greatest interests were for animal tagging, 
industrial applications, and toll roads. 
Since the 1990s many technological developments have been dramatically ex-
panding the functionality of the RFID. Advances in microelectronics, embedded 
software, and microwave circuit integration are opening the door to new wireless 
system and expanding the application field of RFID1.
Benefits of RFID technology are that it allows manufacturers, retailers, and 
suppliers to efficiently collect, manage, distribute, and store information on inven-
tory, business processes, and security controls. RFID will allow retailers to identify 
potential delays and shortages, grocery stores to eliminate or reduce item spoilage, 
toll systems to identify and collect auto tolls on roadways, and suppliers to track 
shipments and in the case of critical materials, RFID will allow receiving authori-
ties to verify the security and authentication of shipped items. 
These uses are seen as only the beginning, and as RFID is deployed across dif-
ferent sectors and services, increasing efficiency and visibility, we can already see 
other applications and benefits, for example, in the medical and health care field.
3.3.2  RFID System Overview
In general terms, RFID represents a way of identifying objects or people using radio 
waves. Identification is possible by means of unique numbers that identify objects, 
people, and information, stored on microchips, which can be read automatically, 
unlike bar codes, which need to be scanned manually. With recent advancements in

A search of the U.S. Patent Office alone will reveal over 350 patents related to RFID and its use and that 
number is still growing.

the technology, the automatic identification data capture industry is accelerating its 
efforts to identify new applications to take advantage of RFID. 
RFID is fundamentally based on wireless communication, making use of ra-
dio waves, which form part of the electromagnetic spectrum; it is not unlike two 
other wireless technologies, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The three technologies are all 
designed for very different uses and therefore have different functionalities, but 
there is shared ground among them, with some hybrids starting to appear. RFID 
systems can utilize both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (and potentially other technologies, 
like UWB, for example) and need not see them as competitors. 
All RFID systems are composed of three main components:
•• RFID tag, or transponder, which is located on the object to be identified and 
is the data carrier in the RFID system;
•• RFID reader, or transceiver, which may be able to both read data from and 
write data to a transponder;
•• Data processing subsystem, which utilizes, in some useful manner, the data 
obtained from the transceiver.
The essential requirement in an RFID system is to transfer data stored in a 
tag, to a reader, across a wireless air interface (the region between the tag and the 
reader). A two-way communication process is required to do this and requires a 
radio carrier signal suitably modified (modulated) to carry the data. The concept is 
depicted in Figure 3.2. 
The RFID concept works as follows: a reader transmits a signal that is received 
by an antenna integrated with a small RF chip. In general, the chip is activated 
only when an RFID reader scans it. When the chip wakes up, it sends the unique 
identifier number, which the reader passes along to applications such as inventory 
control and shipping. It is this level of application logic that provides the selection 
of particular tag and data manipulation criteria for those identified tag(s). 
Figure 3.2  Basic components of RFID systems.

��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
Using a host computer application program, specific tags can be selected to be 
identified, and the data contained within those tags to be acted upon while those 
tags are active within the RF portal (interrogation area). The RF portal is defined as 
the area where RFID tags can be read or written to; it can be stationary or mobile.
Stationary portals are used mainly in applications where the item containing 
the RFID tag has to follow some prescribed physical path or flow. An example of 
this would be a location in which warehouse goods flow through a dock door or 
with items that travel down a conveyor or assembly line. 
Portable or mobile interrogators are used in applications when the tagged 
items do not follow a predefined path. This type of RFID interrogator can be used 
in conjunction with a portable computing device, such as a portable data terminal 
or mobile pen computer. Typical applications include asset tracking, picking or 
moving inventory, inspection, and quality control. In portable or mobile applica-
tions, the interrogator is aimed into a certain physical area in which RFID tags 
need to be scanned. It is more flexible in application scope since the user will define 
the RF portal by orienting the longitudinal and latitudinal axis of the interrogator. 
However, because this device operates on batteries, it is limited in its effective range 
of scanning or RF portal depth of field. The energized period of operation of this 
type of interrogator must also be controlled so that battery life can be maximized.
There are many potential applications for RFID; the most obvious one is as a 
more robust replacement to bar codes. However, innovative companies are regu-
larly finding new application for the enhanced range, capacity, and read/write ca-
pability. The RFID readers can be big enough for forklifts to pass through or small 
enough to fit on retail shelves.
RFID operates in license-exempt spectrum space, but the exact frequencies that 
constitute license-exempt bands may vary depending on the regulations in different 
countries. Typical carrier frequencies (reader’s transmitting frequency) in today’s 
applications range from 125 kHz to 2.45 GHz (with 5.8 GHz also being consid-
ered). The frequency bands must be selected carefully for applications because each 
one has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
The RFID systems themselves can achieve high levels of complexity having 
incorporated memory, data processing capabilities that include communication 
encryption, and protocols (Figure 3.3). As we will see later, the air interface (com-
munication between the reader and the tag), physical interrogator, data protocol 
processor, and application commands and interfaces are all covered by the differ-
ent, but related, standards.
A high-level description of the sequence of communication is as follows:
1.	 The host manages reader(s) and issues commands, after which the reader 
and the tag communicate via RF signal.
2.	 The reader continuously generates an RF carrier sine wave, watching al-
ways for modulation to occur. Detected modulation of the field would in-
dicate the presence of a tag.
3.	 The carrier signal is sent out through the antennas.
4.	 Carrier signal hits tag(s) (Figure 3.4).
5.	 Once the tag has received sufficient energy to operate correctly, it divides 
down the carrier and begins clocking its data to an output transistor, which 
is normally connected across the coil inputs. 

3.3  Radio Frequency Identification 
57
6.	 Tag receives and modifies carrier signal and sends back modulated signal 
(passive backscatter, which FCC and ITU refer to as a field disturbance de-
vice). The tag’s output transistor shunts the coil, sequentially correspond-
ing to the data that are being clocked out of the memory array. Inductive 
coupling and load modulation are used at lower frequencies, as opposed 
to systems operating at 2.45 GHz and higher bands, where true RF com-
munication links and backscatter principles are used.
7.	 Shunting the coil causes a momentary fluctuation (dampening) of the car-
rier wave, which is seen as a slight change in amplitude of the carrier.
8.	 Antennas receive the modulated signal and send them to the reader.
9.	 The reader decodes the data. The reader peak-detects the amplitude-modu-
lated data and processes the resulting bit stream according to the encoding 
and data modulation methods used.
10.	The results are returned to the host application.

The general requirements for the tag antenna are small size, high efficiency, and 
sufficient beamwidth for the reduction of orientation sensitivity. Tags also require 
simplicity and low manufacturing costs.
3.3.3	
Principles of RFID Operation
3.3.3.1 Near-Field and Far-Field Operations
The coupling between tag and reader is achieved in one of two ways, depending 
upon the carrier frequency used and the system and antenna design (Figure 3.5).
Low- (<135 kHz) and high-frequency (typically 13.56 MHz) systems invariably 
use reactive (typically inductive) coupling, wherein the predominantly magnetic 
field component carries the data in the communication between tag and reader, 
in much the same way as coupling between primary and secondary coils in an air-
cored transformer. In these systems the field is effectively tied to its source, and the 
field that couples with the tag is modulated by means of the tag circuitry, such that 
the data-related changes can be sensed by the reader.
The second form of coupling is by propagation of the electromagnetic field 
used to read or interrogate the tag. In these systems field components dissociate 
from their source in the reader and propagate into free space. The components of 
an RFID system that largely determine whether an RFID system couples by induc-
tive or propagation means are the antenna and the manner in which it is driven in 
electrical terms. The term antenna we can only use when describing the propaga-
tion coupling. Inductive coupling systems do not contain real antenna, just induc-
tively coupled coils. 
Figure 3.5  Inductive and propagation coupling RFID systems.

3.3  Radio Frequency Identification 
59
For low- and high-frequency RFID systems, the coils are structured and driven 
in such a way that the propagation component is small or even nonexistent, while 
the reactive component is predominant. At ultrahigh frequencies and above, the 
systems are essentially structured and driven to operate in the propagation mode, 
the antenna dimensions being matched or appropriately related to the carrier wave-
length to achieve the desired result. In these systems the reactive component is 
designed to be suitably small.
The far field begins where the near field ends, although not abruptly, at the 
certain distance from the transmitting antenna. In the near field, the tag-to-reader 
communication is achieved via load modulation. Load modulation is achieved by 
modulating the impedance of the tag as seen by the reader. In the far field, the tag-
to-reader communication is achieved via backscatter. Backscatter is achieved by 
modulating the radar cross section of the tag antenna.
3.3.3.2 Inductive Coupling and the Load Modulation
When a tag is placed within the alternating magnetic field created by the reader, 
it draws energy from the magnetic field. This additional power consumption can 
be measured remotely as a voltage perturbation at the internal impedance of the 
reader coil. The periodic switching on/off of a load resistance at the tag therefore 
effects voltage changes at the reader’s coil and thus has the effect of an amplitude 
modulation of the coil voltage by the remote tag. If the switching on/off of the load 
resistance is controlled by the tag’s stored data stream, then this data is transferred 
from the tag to the reader. This type of data transfer is called load modulation. 
In load modulation the carrier signal is modulated by switching impedance from 
a matched condition to an unmatched condition to alter the reflection coefficient. 
The data transfer from the transponder to the reader can be achieved in three differ-
ent ways: load modulation, load modulation by using a subcarrier (frequencies be-
low 30 MHz), or load modulation using subharmonic procedure (above 100 MHz).
The incident radio electromagnetic wave is received by the tag through the 
coil. The radiated energy is then converted to electrical current and travels down 
a transmission line configuration with intrinsic impedance Z0 (determined by the 
material properties of the transmission line) to load impedance, ZL. In a transmis-
sion line theory, as already mentioned in more detail in Chapter 2, three special 
cases are possible:
•• Matched load, ZL = Z0, no reflection;
•• Open load, ZL= ∞, full in-phase reflection;
•• Shorted load, ZL = 0, full out-of-phase reflection.
At the end of the transmission line, the electric waveform reaches a PIN diode, 
represented as a switch in Figure 3.6, and is used to toggle between two types of 
load impedances [3]. When the diode is forward biased, the current is allowed to 
flow through the matched load making ZL = Z0, and thus causes the reflection 
coefficient to equal zero. In the first case, all of the forward-traveling current is ab-
sorbed by the load and no power is sent backwards through the transmission line. 
When no power is transmitted, the tag transmits a logical bit 0. 

60 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
When the diode is reverse-biased, the load impedance essentially becomes in-
finite and makes the coefficient of reflection equal to 1. In this case, no power is 
absorbed, and all of it is reflected back down the line. When all the incident power 
is reflected, the tag transmits a logical bit 1.
These bits are propagated through the modulated backscatter, and ride on top 
of the reflected wave to the receiver. There are several methods to encode the data 
onto the carrier wave. The process of load modulation creates amplitude-modu-
lated sidebands symmetrically placed around the 13.56-MHz interrogation carrier 
frequency. 
Because the coupling between reader antenna and tag is relatively weak and 
the voltage change created by the tag leads to relatively poor signal-to-noise ratios, 
reply code modulation with a subcarrier is utilized in most RFID chips. In this 
improved signaling method, the tag’s data reply information is contained in a pair 
of backscattered sidebands, which are subsequently demodulated in the RF and 
baseband signal processing sections of the reader to recover the tag’s data stream. 
In the subharmonic procedure, a second frequency (which is usually lower by 
a factor of 2) is derived by a digital division by 2 of the reader’s transmission 
frequency. The output signal of a binary divider can be modulated with the data 
stream from the transponder. One popular operating frequency for subharmonic 
systems is 128 kHz. This gives rise to a transponder response frequency of 64 kHz.
3.3.3.3 Propagation Coupling and the Backscatter Modulation
The term backscatter modulation refers to the communication method used by a 
passive RFID tag to send data back to the reader. By repeatedly shunting the tag coil 
through a transistor, the tag can cause slight fluctuations in the reader’s RF carrier 
amplitude. 
The RF link behaves essentially as a transformer; as the secondary winding (tag 
coil) is momentarily shunted, the primary winding (reader coil) experiences a mo-
mentary voltage drop. The reader must peak-detect this data at about 60 dB down 
Figure 3.6  Load modulation circuitry.

3.3  Radio Frequency Identification 
61
(about 100 mV riding on a 100-V sine wave). This amplitude modulation loading 
of the reader’s transmitted field provides a communication path back to the reader. 
The data bits can then be encoded or further modulated in a number of ways.
We know from the field of radar technology that electromagnetic waves are 
reflected by objects with dimensions greater than around half the wavelength of 
the wave. The efficiency with which an object reflects electromagnetic waves is 
described by its reflection cross section. Objects that are in resonance with the 
wavefront that hits them, as is the case for antenna at the appropriate frequency, 
for example, have a particularly large reflection cross section.
Figure 3.7 shows a block diagram of a typical passive RFID reader/tag con-
figuration. The reader radiates an unmodulated signal (called the incident wave), 
which impinges on the tag. The tag antenna intercepts this signal, absorbs part 
of it, and reradiates the rest. A switch [field-effect transistor (FET)] is connected 
across the antenna, which, when closed, causes a mismatch in the tag antenna. 
The mismatch causes a small percentage (say, 10%) of the signal to be absorbed, 
which, in turn, results in the other 90% being reradiated. The switch, also known 
as a modulator, is controlled by the tag output data stream and causes the tag data 
to be modulated onto the incident wave and be reradiated (or backscattered) as a 
modulated signal. This technique is known as impedance modulated backscatter or 
backscatter modulation for short. 
The amount of energy intercepted and reradiated is determined by the differ-
ential radar cross section of the tag, which, in turn, is a function of the tag antenna 
aperture and modulation depth. 
The operating range of the tag is determined by the reader’s transmitted power, 
the reader’s receiver sensitivity, the path loss in both directions between the reader 
and tag, and the differential radar cross section of the tag. The backscattered signal 
received at the reader receiver decreases as the fourth power of the distance be-
tween the reader and tag (the square of the power in each direction). For example, 
a typical 900-MHz tag will have a radar cross section of at least 0.005m2 and typi-
cally 0.024m2. 
Present-day receiver technology allows a reader to reliably decode a signal hav-
ing a strength of –80 dBm or higher. This means that the signal arriving back at the 
reader from a tag must be stronger than –80 dBm. 
The ratio of power transmitted by the reader (incident wave) and power re-
turning from the transponder (backscatter wave) can be estimated using the radar 
equation, a detail of which can be found in Chapter 5.
The reader’s RF transceiver block diagram shown in Figure 3.7 uses the ho-
modyne topology and represents the classic approach for backscatter radar where 
received signals are close in frequency to the transmitted carrier. A homodyne re-
ceiver performs a direct conversion of the received RF signals to a zero intermediate 
frequency (IF) baseband. Elimination of the IF reduces the need to perform image 
rejection filtering as is typical with other receiver approaches, such as the super-
heterodyne approach. This architecture uses two high compression point MMIC 
mixers in quadrature along with lowpass filtering. 
Reducing continuous wave (CW) carrier leakage into the RF port of the mixers 
is critical to receiver performance since the resulting phase discriminator generates 
unwanted dc signal offsets. Leakage of the high-power transmitting signal into

the receive path can saturate the receiver and significantly degrade receiver signal 
sensitivity. 
The power is supplied to the tag’s antenna connections as HF voltage, and after 
rectification by the diodes, it can be used as turn-on voltage for the deactivation 
or activation of the power saving power-down mode. The diodes used here are 
low-barrier Schottky diodes, which have a particularly low threshold voltage. The 
voltage obtained may also be sufficient to serve as a power supply for short ranges.
Functions performed by the reader may include quite sophisticated signal con-
ditioning and parity error checking and correction. Once the signal from a tran-
sponder has been correctly received and decoded, algorithms may be applied to 
decide whether the signal is a repeat transmission and may then instruct the tran-
sponder to cease transmitting. This is known as the Command Response Protocol 
and is used to circumvent the problem of reading multiple tags, in a short period 
of time. Using interrogators in this way is sometimes referred to as hands-down 
polling. 
A more secure but slower tag polling alternative is a technique called hands-
up polling, which involves the interrogator looking for tags with specific identities 
and interrogating them in turn. This is contention management, and a variety of 
techniques have been developed to improve the process of batch (multiple tags) 
reading.
3.3.4	
The Electronic Product Code System
Electronic Product Code (EPC) is an item numbering and networking concept that 
emerged from research undertaken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) Auto-ID Center, and associated centers, in which RFID data carriers were 
identified as the method of choice for carrying the EPC numbers [4].
3.3.4.1 Electronic Product Code
The RFID technology itself offers several improvements over its predecessor tech-
nologies: the bar code and magnetic stripe cards. The central data feature of RFID 
technology is the electronic product code, which is viewed by many in the industry 
as the next generation bar code or the Universal Product Code (UPC). EPC code is 
a 96-bit code created by the Auto-ID Center that would one day replace bar codes 
(Figure 3.8). 
The EPC has digits to identify the manufacturer, product category, and indi-
vidual item. It is backed by the United Code Council and EAN International, the 
two main bodies that oversee bar code standards. The EPC code can carry more 
data than the UPC code and can be reprogrammed with new information if neces-
sary. Like the UPC, the EPC code consists of a series of numbers that identify the 
manufacturer and product type. The EPC code also includes an extra set of digits 
to identify unique items.
The EPC numbering scheme, initially composed of a 96-bit code, is structured 
as follows:
•• An 8-bit header (also known as a EPC version number);

64 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
•• EPC manager, 28 bits to facilitate identification of the item manufacturer or 
source provider, for example;
•• Object class identifier, 24 bits to facilitate the identification of the type of 
product, such as a specific stock-keeping-unit;
•• Serial number, 36 bits to facilitate the unique identification of an individual 
item. 
The header is used to distinguish multiple EPC formats, thus allowing designa-
tion of differing bit lengths tags as the technology matures (a 256-bit version has 
been proposed). The header can also be used to distinguish bit-length field varia-
tions to those indicated above with respect to manufacturer, product, and serial 
number support, thus allowing longer and more manufacturer identifiers for or-
ganization with a small number of product types and serial number requirements. 
While the initial bit-length designation for EPC was 96 bits, a shorter 64-bit 
version has been introduced on an interim basis to help facilitate the realization of 
lower-cost RFID data carrier devices. This seems reasonable on the basis that the 
full identification capability of the 96-bit version would not be required for some 
time.
3.3.4.2  Object Naming Service
EPC Object Naming Service (ONS) was introduced to provide a directory service 
capable of supporting the linkage of EPC numbers with additional data or infor-
mation concerning the item to which the EPC tag is attached. These additional 
item-associated data or information may be stored on a server connected to a local 
network or the Internet. The ONS is analogous to the domain name service used for 
location of information on the Internet.
3.3.4.3  Physical Markup Language 
Physical Markup Language (PML) is structured to allow the information about 
an item or object to be appropriately specified. The PML is based upon the 
popular XML metadata language, its syntax, and semantics to be administered 
Figure 3.8  Electronic Product Code.

3.3  Radio Frequency Identification 
65
and developed by the governing body (EPCglobal) in conjunction with the user 
community. 
Product definitions within this language markup facility, which began with 
food items, require the ongoing efforts of the governing body to build a sufficiently 
inclusive directory. Product descriptions already undertaken by standards bodies, 
such as the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), are being seen as valuable sources of 
information in this respect. 
In addition to fixed product information, the PML will also accommodate dy-
namic quantities, such as temperature, humidity or vibration, which may change 
as a result of some local, environmental, or intrinsic effect, including changes over 
time (temporal effects). This adds a further dimension to the data gathering and 
handling processes and, when presented in a PML file, may offer innovative op-
portunities for process enhancement. For example, condition status information 
derived dynamically could be used to automatically determine product pricing.
3.3.4.4  Savant Software 
Savant is the specification for standard RFID middleware, that is, software that 
bridges RFID hardware and enterprise applications. It defines an EPC events han-
dling framework and is thus the primary means of data gathering for any RFID 
deployment. It acts as the central nervous system of the EPCglobal Network [5]. 
Savant’s most basic function is to receive the EPC number and direct a query 
over the Internet or other established network to the ONS which then returns an 
address at which the item information is stored. The information is available to, 
and can be augmented by, Savant systems within the network, ostensibly around 
the world. 
The very high data handling envisaged within the EPC infrastructure indicates 
the potential need for companies to maintain ONS servers locally to support rapid 
retrieval of information. The Savant software is being developed to use a distrib-
uted architecture with a hierarchical structure to manage data flow. A highly ex-
tensive network of Savants is envisaged to support the EPC data management, with 
Savant platforms running, for example, in factories, stores, distribution centers, 
and regional support facilities, and even on mobile platforms such as container 
trucks and cargo planes. Creating such an infrastructure is one of the biggest chal-
lenges to realizing the EPC support objectives.
3.3.5  RFID and Biometrics
Biometric technology is the use of human bodily characteristics or “physiological 
autographs” in an attempt to uniquely and absolutely identify individuals. The 
earlier forms of unique body characteristics were recognized in the science of finger-
prints in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the Automated Fingerprint Identification System 
(AFIS), developed by NEC Technologies completely changed the role of finger-
prints. It combined computer graphics with special software programs and parallel 
processing to create forensic results.
Today biometric technologies include retina prints, iris prints, signature and 
handwriting analysis, palm prints and hand geometry, voiceprints, face recognition, 

66 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
facial thermograms, silhouette identification and gait prints, and even specific task 
performance and writing styles. 
Biometrics is widely used in fields as varied as e-commerce, network access, 
time and attendance, ATMs, corrections, banking, and medical record access. Due 
to the apparent ease of use and other factors, biometric technology applications 
are being used increasingly throughout private businesses and governmental sec-
tors. Of all the mentioned biometric identification systems, iris prints appear to be 
the most accurate. The iris patterns of each person’s eyes are fixed before birth and 
remain unchanged throughout one’s life unless trauma interferes.
Although phenomenal growth in both smart card and biometric technologies 
has been witnessed, another area of more recent and rapid growth is the merging 
of these and many other technical elements into the field of RFID. Major initiatives 
by the United States and other governments aim to combine RFID and biometric 
technologies in a new generation of identity cards. Together, RFID and biometric 
technologies promise to reduce fraud, ease identity checks, and enhance security. 
As part of its US-VISIT program, the U.S. government has mandated adoption 
of biometrically-enabled passports by the 27 nations in its Visa-Waiver Program 
(VWP), among them Japan, most of the nations of Western Europe, and a handful 
of others [6]. Soon, all passports produced in the United States will carry biometric 
information. These passports are based on guidelines issued by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a body run by the United Nations with a 
mandate for setting international passport standards. 
The ICAO guidelines, detailed in ICAO Document 9303, call for the incorpo-
ration of RFID chips into passports. Such chips are present in initial deployments 
of biometrically enabled U.S. passports and in the biometrically enabled passports 
of other nations as well. Next generation passports, sometimes called e-passports, 
will be a widespread form of identification within a couple of years. E-passports 
will contain digitized photographic images of the faces of their bearers. 
The standard additionally specifies fingerprints and iris data as optional bio-
metrics, and the goal is the strong authentication through documents that unequiv-
ocally identify their bearers. Data integrity and physical integrity are vital to the 
security of ID cards as authenticators. For authorities to establish someone’s iden-
tity with certainty, for example, the passport must carry a photograph of irrefut-
able pedigree, with a guarantee that no substitution or tampering has taken place. 
Without this guarantee, passports can be forged, enabling unauthorized persons to 
enter a country.
Strong authentication requires more than resistance to tampering. Data con-
fidentiality, that is, secrecy of data stored on ID cards, is also critical. Protecting 
biometric and biographical data is essential to the value and integrity of an authen-
tication system. In particular, data secrecy affords an important form of protection 
against forgery and spoofing attacks. Therefore, protecting e-passport data against 
unauthorized access is a crucial part of the security of the entire system. For a full 
review on the work leading to these decisions, see [7].
Confidentiality protection for stored data is important for other reasons as 
well. Both RFID and biometrics are highly privacy-sensitive technologies. Sensitive 
data, such as birth date or nationality, are carried on passports. The privacy, physi-
cal safety, and psychological comfort of the users of next generation passports and 

3.3  Radio Frequency Identification 
67
ID cards will depend on the quality of data-protection mechanisms and supporting 
architecture. 
3.3.6  Challenges of RFID Implementation
It has to be emphasized that the implementation of the technology itself is not a 
difficult exercise; however, to gain the full benefits of implementing RFID within an 
enterprise, a more holistic view needs to be taken. A large volume of data is created 
by implementing RFID, which has to be turned into information and intelligence. 
At the present time, enterprise resource planning technology suppliers are develop-
ing extensions to their products to work with RFID systems [8]. The following list 
represents the potential challenges to be considered when implementing an RFID 
solution. Some of those challenges are discussed in more detail in this chapter.
Business Issues
•• No proven return on investment;
•• Cost of initial implementation;
•• Data sharing between supply chain partners;
•• Intellectual property issues;
•• Environmental (disposal) issues;
•• Consumer privacy objections;
•• Lack of organizational expertise;
•• Lack of historic data.
Technology Issues
•• Technology standards and interoperability;
•• Reliability and maturity of technology;
•• Data integration and evolving middleware;
•• Environmental issues (temperature, moisture);
•• Spectrum congestion and frequency availability;
•• Security of data on tags and readers;
•• Accuracy of tag reading;
•• Volume of data produced.
Large Volumes of Data
Readers can scan each RFID tag several times per second, which generates a high 
volume of raw data. Although the data are redundant and discarded at the reader 
level, processing large volumes of data can be difficult.
Operational Speed
The RFID system must provide accurate reads at all levels, item, case, and pallet, 
without requiring any reduction in throughput.

68 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
Product Information Maintenance
When the reader processes high volumes of RFID tags, the attributes of each tagged 
product must be continually retrieved from a central product catalog database, a 
process that results in challenges for large-scale implementations.
Configuration and Management of Readers and Devices
When a large number of readers and related hardware devices are deployed across 
multiple facilities, configuration and management can be challenging. The imple-
mentation of automated devices for these processes is essential.
Data Integration Across Multiple Facilities
In an enterprise with multiple facilities that are geographically distributed, it is in-
creasingly difficult to manage data in real time and instantaneously aggregate it into 
the central IT facility, a process that can place a significant burden on the network 
infrastructure.
Data Ownership and Partner Data Integration
When there are different companies involved in business processes, such as the re-
tail supply chain, it can create issues pertaining to the ownership and integration of 
the data, thereby compromising the integrity of the solution architecture.
Data Security and Privacy
Depending on the nature of the business application and the solution scenario, 
security and privacy challenges could have a significant impact on the architecture.
Cost
At an average cost of around 20 to 30 cents apiece, RFID tags are still too costly, es-
pecially for retail applications and certainly for use on inexpensive and low-margin 
products, such as a 50-cent candy bar or a $1 bar of soap. This is a key reason why 
mass-market consumer retail businesses operating on very thin profit margins have 
been slow to adopt RFID-based smart shelf and smart checkout technology. RFID 
tag developers are working to lower the cost of tags to 10 cents, or even 5 cents, 
over the next few years. 
Materials
RFID signals are easily blocked. Over short ranges, these signals can be attenuated 
by certain materials (the most common is packing made from metallic substances). 
Over longer ranges, the signals, which are much weaker than commercial radio 
broadcast signals, can be blocked by common objects, including the human body. 
Researchers are working to solve this problem by using novel designs for tag anten-
nas and more sensitive reader arrays.
Tag Form Factor/Size
Full flexibility in tag sizing is required in order to accommodate the smallest items, 
as well as cases and pallets, with the same high level of reliability and performance 
for all tags. In addition, tags must be able to be rigid as well as flexible, for example, 

3.4  Wireless Sensor Networks 
69
to accommodate the curve of a pill bottle. And regardless of how tiny or flexible the 
tag must be, read-range requirements must still be met.
Tag Proximity and Orientation
RFID tags and readers are orientation dependent, so tags must be positioned prop-
erly relative to readers in order for the antenna coils to exchange signals. The solu-
tion to this problem will come with the development of multiple-reader systems that 
use an array of readers positioned to cover all the possible orientations for tagged 
items that might, for example, be found in a display bin in a store. Part of this solu-
tion will involve protocols to coordinate the operation of these reader arrays.
Environmental Noise
Because RFID equipment may be operating in the environment that generates elec-
tromagnetic energy (for example, cordless phones, mobile radios, fluorescent light-
ing, electrical equipment, and other RFID readers), the RFID system selected must 
be able to reject the interference from these products in order to ensure predictable 
and reliable system performance.
Accuracy of Tag Reading 
RFID readers often experience false negatives and false positives. A false negative 
occurs when a valid tag passes within the prescribed range of an RFID reader, but 
the reader does not read the tag. This can happen for many reasons, including when 
a case tag is buried deep inside a pallet, when reader signals are blocked or absorbed 
by substances such as metal or water, or when a case tag is not oriented properly 
(tag reads are more successful when tags are perpendicular to reader signals). 
A false positive occurs when a tag accidentally passes within range of an RFID 
reader but was not intended to be read. False negatives and false positives often 
occur with closely packed items where multiple tags in close proximity shadow 
each other.
Competing Technical Standards 
Competing standards prevent the universal adoption of RFID readers and tags. Dif-
ferent manufacturers are developing tag protocols that operate at different frequen-
cies, with a variety of packet. Ideally, a single standard should be adopted to make 
all tags compatible with all readers. Both the cost and standardization challenges 
are being addressed by individual companies and by the Auto-ID Center and the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), industry consortia working 
to set standards for RFID tags.
3.4  Wireless Sensor Networks
3.4.1  Basics of Wireless Sensor Networks 
Wireless sensor network (WSN) is the generic name for the technology consisting 
of a broad range of devices. Basically, any collection of devices equipped with a 
processor, having sensing and communication capabilities that are able to organize 
them into a network created in an ad hoc manner falls into this category. 

70 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
Research in the field of WSNs has increased tremendously during the last few 
years, and the initial projects have shown that building cheap smart sensors that 
can network is possible and the addition of the wireless communication capabili-
ties to sensors increased their functionality dramatically. WSNs bring monitoring 
capabilities that will forever change the way in which data is collected from the 
ambient environment [9]. 
The field of sensor networks is a relatively new one. Scientists from various 
communities approached this research area with enthusiasm and brought together 
knowledge from the various domains of computer science, electrical engineering, 
telecommunications, radiocommunications, and so forth. The initial directions of 
research were specific to each of these fields, everyone trying to adapt their knowl-
edge to make WSNs a reality.
Let us take, for example, the traditional monitoring approach of a remote loca-
tion for a given phenomenon, such as recording the geological activity, monitoring 
the chemical or biological properties of a region, or even monitoring the weather 
at a certain place. The old approach was to build rather big and robust devices. 
Besides the sensor pack itself, these devices contained a big power supply and lo-
cal data-storage capabilities. A team of technicians would have to travel together 
to the destination being monitored to place these expensive devices at predefined 
positions and calibrate all the sensors. Then they would come back after a certain 
amount of time in order to collect the sensed data. If, by misfortune, some hard-
ware failed, then nothing could be done about it and the information about the 
phenomenon itself would be lost.
The new approach is to construct inexpensive, small sized, energy-efficient 
sensing devices. Because hundreds or thousands of these devices will be deployed, 
the reliability constraints for them will diminish. No local data storage is needed 
anymore because they will process locally and then transmit wirelessly the ob-
served characteristic of the phenomenon to one or more access points connected to 
a computer network. The individual calibration of each sensor node is no longer 
needed because it can be performed by localized algorithms. The deployment will 
also be easier, by randomly placing the nodes (e.g., simply throwing them from a 
plane) onto the monitored region.
Wireless sensor networks are one of the most important tools of the new era of 
computing. They are the simplest intelligent devices around, having as their main 
purpose monitoring the environment surrounding us and alerting us of the main 
events happening. Based on the observation reported by these instruments, humans 
and machines can make decisions and act on them.
3.4.2  Applications of Wireless Sensor Networks
At this moment a large variety of sensors exists and sensors have been developed 
to monitor almost every aspect of the ambient world: lighting conditions, tempera-
ture, humidity, pressure, the presence or absence of various chemical or biological 
products, detection of presence and movement, and so forth. 
The sensor networks field is rapidly evolving, and although a large number 
of sensor network prototypes exist at this moment, the possible new applica-
tion areas are still being explored. The typical application that one can think of 

3.4  Wireless Sensor Networks 
71
has as the main goal some sort of monitoring, with the most common one being 
environmental monitoring. Some of the potential applications are listed as follows.
3.4.2.1  Intelligent Warehouses
Each item contained inside the warehouse will have a sensor tag attached that will 
be monitored by the sensor nodes embedded into the walls and shelves. Based on 
the read data, knowledge of the spatial positioning of the sensors, and time infor-
mation, the sensor network will offer information about the traffic of goods inside 
the building, create automatic inventories, and even perform long-term correlations 
between the read data. There will be no need for manual product scanning. 
3.4.2.2  Environmental Monitoring 
This is the widest area of applications envisioned up to now; a particular applica-
tion in this category is disaster monitoring. The sensor nodes deployed in the af-
fected areas can help humans estimate the effects of the disaster, build maps of the 
safe areas, and direct the human actions towards the affected regions. 
A large number of applications in this category address monitoring of wildlife. 
This scenario has an increased complexity. The area of deployment is no longer 
accessible in an easy manner and is no longer safe for the sensor nodes. There is 
hardly any infrastructure present, and a large number of nodes have to be scattered 
around in a random manner; in addition, the network might contain moving nodes.
3.4.2.3  Intelligent Highways
Cars have integrated sensors and these sensor nodes will communicate with each 
other collecting information about the traffic, routes, and special traffic conditions. 
On one hand, new information will be available to the driver of each car. On the 
other hand, a global view of the whole picture will also be available. The two main 
constraints that characterize this scenario are the large number of nodes and their 
high mobility. The algorithms employed will have to scale well and deal with a net-
work with a continuously changing topology.
3.4.2.4  Military Applications
Factors such as rapid deployment, self-organization, and increased fault tolerance 
make wireless sensor networks a very good candidate for usage in the military field. 
They are suited for deployment in battlefield scenarios due to the large size of the 
network and the automatic self-reconfiguration at the moment of the destruction/
unavailability of some sensor nodes. Typical applications are for monitoring of 
friendly forces, equipment and ammunition, battlefield surveillance, reconnaissance 
of opposing forces and terrain, targeting, battle damage assessment, and nuclear, 
biological, and chemical attack detection and reconnaissance. 

72 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
3.4.2.5  Health Care Applications
An increasing interest is being shown to the elder population. Sensor networks can 
help in several areas of the health care field. The monitoring can take place both at 
home and in hospitals. 
At home, patients can be under permanent monitoring, and the sensor net-
works will trigger alerts whenever there is a change in the state of the patient. 
Systems that can detect their movement behavior at home, detect any fall, or re-
mind them to take their prescriptions are being studied. Also, in hospitals, sensor 
networks can be used in order to track the position of doctors and patients (their 
status or even errors in the medication), expensive hardware, and so forth. 
Wireless sensor networks can also use sensors implanted inside of the human 
body; a combination of sensors, RFID principles of operation, and propagation ef-
fects inside of the human body are described in more detail in Chapter 7.
3.4.2.6  Home Applications
The home is the perfect application domain for the pervasive computing field. We 
can imagine a future with all the electronic appliances forming a network and co-
operating together to fulfill the needs of the inhabitants. These electronic appliances 
will have to identify each user correctly, remember their preferences and habits, 
and, at the same time, monitor the entire house for unexpected events. The sensor 
networks have also an important role here, being the eyes and the ears that will 
trigger the actuator systems. 
3.4.3  Concept of Ambient Intelligence
The next step from RFID systems is ambient intelligence (AmI), a new field de-
scribed as a seamless environment of computing, wireless sensor networks, ad-
vanced networking technology, and specific interfaces. AmI will have networking 
technology embedded in everyday objects such as furniture, clothes, vehicles, appli-
ances, roads, and smart materials. This environment should be aware of the specific 
characteristics and the needs of users, should be capable of responding intelligently 
to spoken or gestured indications of desire, and should possibly even result in sys-
tems that are capable of engaging in intelligent dialogue. 
AmI will be unobtrusive and simple in implementation and usage [10], and 
based on three key, fairly new, technologies: ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous 
communication, and intelligent user interfaces. By providing an intelligent envi-
ronment, innovative intelligent personal health services can be developed while 
improving the quality and cost control at the same time [11]. 
The WSN and BAN are the necessary technology for the development of the 
concept of AmI where users (patients) are provided of services depending on their 
context [12]. Intelligent interfaces can empower people with severe motion im-
pairments that can result from nonprogressive disorders, such as cerebral palsy, 
or degenerative neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
multiple sclerosis (MS), or muscular dystrophy (MD) [13].
Although the application of the AmI vision may lead to a dramatic lowering of 
costs (reduction of time to diagnosis and time to treatment, outpatient diagnosis 

3.4  Wireless Sensor Networks 
73
and treatment, and so forth), the risk of dehumanization and depersonalization of 
the patient should be carefully considered. The problem may exist in a progressive 
dehumanization and identification of the patient with the collection of his or her vi-
tal parameters. In other words, the risk is that the patient will be progressively dis-
embodied, reduced to the sum of his or her biological and physiological functions. 
A second risk may arise from the possibility for the patient to monitor directly 
data detected and stored by wearable biometric devices. This capability may con-
tribute to increase an awareness of the patient’s body, but it may also increase the 
likelihood of self-diagnosis, with potential serious implications for the patient’s 
health [14].
3.4.4  Sensor Networks Design Considerations
3.4.4.1  Sensor Networks Topology
The basic issue in communication networks is the transmission of messages to 
achieve a prescribed message throughput and quality of service (QoS). QoS can be 
specified in terms of message delay, message due dates, bit error rates, packet loss, 
and economic cost of transmission, transmission power, and so forth. 
Depending on QoS, the installation environment, the economic considerations, 
and the application, one of several basic network topologies may be used. A com-
munication network is composed of nodes, each of which has computing power 
and can transmit and receive messages over communication links, wireless or wire-
line. The basic network topologies are shown in Figure 3.9 and include fully con-
nected, mesh, star, ring, tree, and bus. 
A single network may consist of several interconnected subnets of different to-
pologies. Networks are further classified as local area networks (LANs) (e.g., inside 
one building) or wide area networks (WANs) (e.g., between buildings).
Mesh networks are regularly distributed networks that generally allow trans-
mission only to a node’s nearest neighbors. The nodes in these networks are gener-
ally identical, so that mesh nets are also referred to as peer-to-peer networks. Mesh 
networks can be good models for large-scale networks of wireless sensors that are 
distributed over a geographic region, for example, personnel or vehicle security 
surveillance systems. 
Figure 3.9  Basic network topologies.

74 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
Note that the regular structure reflects the communications topology; the actual 
geographic distribution of the nodes does not need to be a regular mesh [15]. Since 
there are generally multiple routing paths between nodes, these nets are robust to 
failure of individual nodes or links. An advantage of mesh nets is that, although all 
nodes may be identical and have the same computing and transmission capabilities, 
certain nodes can be designated as group leaders that take on additional functions. 
If a group leader is disabled, another node can then take over these duties.
The required transmission power in a wireless link increases as the square of 
the distance between source and destination. Therefore, multiple short message 
transmission hops require less power than one long hop. In fact, if the distance be-
tween source and destination is R, the power required for single-hop transmission 
is proportional to R2. If nodes between source and destination are taken advantage 
of to transmit n short hops instead, the power required by each node is propor-
tional to R2/n2. This is a strong argument in favor of distributed networks with 
multiple nodes, that is, mesh networks.
If we take a look at the number of sensors deployed with respect to the area 
covered, we can give the following categorization:
•• Coarse grained sensor networks: In this category usually fall the sensor net-
works made up of devices, each covering a large area. These devices are 
usually large and expensive, because they are equipped with high quality 
sensors. The network topology is usually a star topology. The sensor nodes 
themselves are fixed.
•• Fine grained sensor networks: This category comprises the networks made 
up of s large number of cheap devices, equipped with low-quality sensors 
having small amounts of resources available. The network topology is usu-
ally a multihop network. The large number of sensors and the dense deploy-
ment compensates the low quality of the sensors, the network as a whole 
producing high-quality results.¶
3.4.4.2  Sensor Networks Standardization and Compatibility
Desirable functions for sensor nodes include ease of installation, self-identification, 
self-diagnosis, reliability, time awareness for coordination with other nodes, some 
software functions and DSP, and standard control protocols and network inter-
faces. There are many sensor manufacturers and networks on the market today. 
It is too costly for manufacturers to make special transducers for every network 
on the market so different components made by different manufacturers should 
be compatible. Therefore, in 1993 the IEEE and NIST began work on a standard 
that resulted in IEEE 1451, an industry-wide open standard for intelligent sensors 
(smart sensors) [16].
The objective of this standard is to make it easier for different manufacturers to 
develop smart sensors and to interface those devices to networks. Under the original 
concept of IEEE 1451, a sensor is divided into two parts. The first, IEEE 1451.1-
1999, called a Smart Transducer Interface Module (STIM), contains the sensing 
element (strain gage, thermocouple, vibration sensor, and so on), the appropriate 
signal-conditioning circuits and A/D converter, and a Transducer Electronic Data 

3.4  Wireless Sensor Networks 
75
Sheet (TEDS), a memory chip that identifies the type of sensor, its make and model, 
its calibration information, its scale factor, and more. IEEE 1451.2-1997 defines 
the basic STIM, while IEEE 1451.1 defines the Network Capable Application Pro-
tocol (NCAP) (Figure 3.10).
Although 1451.1 and 1451.2 worked well, they did not cover enough configu-
rations, and another substandard was started, IEEE 1451.3-2003, “Standard for 
a Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors and Actuators, Digital Communication 
and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats for Distributed Multidrop 
Systems” (often called Dot3), which allows multiple transducer modules (called 
transducer bus interface modules) of varying complexity and data rates to be mul-
tidropped to one NCAP via a local transducer bus.
One limitation of IEEE 1451 was the lack of backward compatibility, that is, 
it did not address the large number of legacy sensors devices with analog outputs 
and no digital communications already in use. IEEE 1451.4-2004, “Standard for a 
Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors and Actuators-Mixed-Mode Communica-
tion Protocols and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats” (also called 
Dot4), was proposed as a way to do this. Unlike Dot2 and Dot3 sensors, a Dot4-
compliant sensor has an analog output and no A/D converter, but it does contain 
a TEDS. 
Other related standards are:
•• IEEE 1451.0-2007, “Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors 
and Actuators—Common Functions, Communication Protocols, and Trans-
ducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats”;
Figure 3.10  IEEE 1451 smart transducer concept.

•• IEEE 1451.5-2007, “Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors 
and Actuators—Wireless Communication Protocols & Transducer Elec-
tronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats”;
•• IEEE 1451.7-2010, “Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sen-
sors and Actuators—Transducers to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
Systems Communication Protocols and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet 
Formats.”
The Proposed IEEE 1451.6 Standard is a new and developing standard that 
combines IEEE 1451 and Intrinsically Safe (IS) technologies2.
3.4.5  The Future of RFID Sensing
Industry is fast moving toward employing networked, digital, and wireless com-
munications technologies for sensors. Using wireless connectivity for sensor net-
works increases the flexibility in deployment and reconfiguration and thus reduces 
the overall infrastructure cost. These advantages will enable sensor networks to 
monitor complex environments for applications ranging from industrial automa-
tion to battlefield surveillance to environment monitoring to the telemetry of a first 
responder’s health condition. 
RFID devices are going to play a key role in automated universal identifica-
tion system for accessing, securing, and tracking assets, personnel, equipment, and 
products throughout the supply chain. Combining RFID devices and sensors could 
expand the overall functionality and capability of the above applications. 
In today’s complex supply chain, even if technology standards are high, vis-
ibility still performs at very low efficiency levels. Asset tracking and management, 
anticounterfeit and in-transit visibility are few of the major contributions of RFID 
technology to the real world. Several suppliers already have met or are preparing 
to meet their retailers’ mandates. However, what if suppliers could not only find 
where their products were located, but also receive information about their condi-
tions and status? 
Location is just one part of the challenge. According to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, 10% of all perishable products spoil before they reach the consumer. 
The solution lies in adding several sensors to the RFID solution. So far, RFID has 
enabled a number of end users to gain a higher visibility of their supply chain, 
increase inventory efficiency, reduce out-of-stock items, and gain higher anticoun-
terfeit protection. RFID sensors can create and provide a new layer of protection 
and advance supply chain visibility.
Efficient sensor networks require the sensor nodes to be cheap, to consume 
little energy, to be multifunctional, to be small, and to have the ability to commu-
nicate both among themselves and with other networks. Compared with mobile ad 
hoc networks, wireless sensor networks differ in various ways, including the larger 
number of nodes, the dense deployment, and the attribution of fault-proneness, the

Intrinsically safe is a condition of safety in a hazardous environment, such as in areas where explosive gas-
ses or other flammable items exist. Any intrinsically safe instrument must not cause any type of ignition in 
any form under normal operation. In case of failure, it must not produce any form of hot spots.

3.5  RFID Applications 
77
frequent topology changes, the main use of broadcast communication instead of 
point-to-point communication, and the limitations in power, storage, and process-
ing units.
3.5  RFID Applications
RFID systems have been deployed in limited numbers for years; two of the most 
predominant have been in the form of toll road collection transponders and secu-
rity badges. Toll road authorities around the country have equipped drivers with 
transponder that are connected to their credit cards, which allows them to pay their 
tolls at 40 mph rather than stopping to throw quarters into a basket and slowing 
down the flow of traffic. 
Security badges have been equipped with RFID chips to allow centralized con-
trol of access to facilities and specific rooms within buildings. These can also be 
used to track the locations of people in a facility by identifying the door through 
which they last passed. Today, RFID has the potential for applications in virtually 
any area of industry, commerce, and services where items are handled and associ-
ated data collected and processed. These include:
•• Supply chain logistics;
•• Product authentication;
•• Tracking and traceability;
•• Security, ticketing, and access control;
•• Lifetime item identification;
•• Transient carrier labeling;
•• Animal and specimen identification;
•• Airline baggage handling.
The following sections will illustrate just a small number of examples; possi-
bilities are truly endless and limited only by our imagination.
3.5.1  Supply Chain Logistics
Global supply chain logistics are expected to be the largest and fastest-growing ap-
plication for RFID. This will most likely be done through smart labeling of cases, 
cartons, and pallets. The key benefits are the ability to read the entire contents of 
mixed pallets all at once during material handling operations such as truck loading 
or unloading. 
Managing pallets, totes, and other returnable transit containers with RFID rep-
resents one of the most dramatic cost-saving opportunities that this technology can 
provide. Many returnable containers are never brought back from customer sites 
after shipment, forcing companies to carry excess inventory to ensure adequate 
supplies of shipping materials where they are needed. Identifying returnable con-
tainers with smart labels or fixed tags enables companies to augment their legacy

bar code shipping applications by automatically recording materials shipped to 
customers. 
Fast-reading RFID enables instant identification of the shipping container and 
all of the individual items inside. For shipping, RFID readers can help packers 
quickly locate and aggregate all the items needed to complete an order.
The same principle is applied to improve warehouse picking. Workers scan 
shelves and bins with an RFID reader that automatically detects the storage loca-
tion of the sought items. The system can also detect items that are stored in the 
wrong location and alert operators to the problem. Using RFID for these appli-
cations enables items to self-report their locations, rather than requiring human 
intervention to find them, thus reducing errors, saving labor, and lowering costs.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the originators of the RFID movement, continues 
to expand its RFID capability to additional facilities. Aside from the initial RFID 
implementation to track inventory, in the near future, customers will be able to 
enjoy advantages such as automatic warranty activation on electronics, freshness 
assurance on foods, thanks to cold chain monitoring, and enhanced product safety 
as a result of faster, more accurate recalls and better freshness monitoring.
3.5.2  Product Authentication 
The role of product authentication is to answer whether a given product is genu-
ine or counterfeit (e.g., a product that infringes a trademark). An explicit way to 
authenticate products is needed in supply-chain applications because counterfeits 
can be very similar or even identical to authentic products. The starting point of 
automated nondestructive product authentication is to insert a special label or se-
curity feature into products, like a hologram or a water mark, and to authenticate 
this label. Product authentication can take place in single item level (smart label3) 
or in aggregated levels. 
Generally, multiple similar units are authenticated simultaneously, for example, 
when a shipment arrives to a retail store. The desired level of security, which can 
be defined as the effort that an illicit actor has to undertake to break or bypass the 
security mechanism, has a major impact on the cost of a product authentication 
system. While minimizing the cost, the level of security should be high enough to 
protect the item over its entire lifespan. Because different products have widely 
varying security requirements, different levels of security and thus different solu-
tions are needed. 
The level of security of product authentication system is defined by the level of 
security of a single security feature and by the granularity of the security features. 
By granularity, we mean how many products use an identical security feature; for 
example, applying weak but unique security features to all products can be more 
secure than using strong but identical features on the same products. One concep-
tual problem of automated product authentication is that it is only the security fea-
3.	
Label with integrated covert inscriptions helps eliminate the illegal practice of empty vials being refilled 
with fake drugs and resold. A multipart label has integrated security features; a label is functionally de-
stroyed during its initial use. When the label’s tear strip is removed, the inscriptions “opened” and “used” 
appear, making undetected reuse of a glass container with an original label virtually impossible.

3.5  RFID Applications

ture that is authenticated and not the product itself; therefore, difference between 
label and product authentication should be made. 
The general requirements of a product authentication system in the supply 
chain application are listed here:
•• The system needs to be used by multiple parties from multiple locations.
•• The authentication of products that are unknown to the system should be 
supported.
•• The cost and effort to perform a check need to be low.
•• The optimal solution should allow also the customers to authenticate 
products.
•• The product authentication system needs to have an appropriate level of 
security.
Among these requirements, the level of security demands most attention in 
the system design. The level of security can be considered as the resistance against 
attacks that are conducted against the authentication system. In supply chain ap-
plications, product authentication is typically performed under the supervision of 
authorized personnel, thus restricting the possible attacks of counterfeit players. 
The general attack scenarios of illicit actors against product authentication 
system can be divided into following four categories:
•• Omission of security features that are applied on the genuine objects refers to 
the counterfeiters’ not taking any explicit actions to fool the authentication. 
These products form a considerable part of the counterfeit trade due, for 
example, to consumer demand of counterfeits.
•• The use of misleading security features means that the fake products are 
equipped with security features whose role is to make the products avoid 
closer inspection. Interviews with brand owners and customs reveal that this 
scenario, together with the aforementioned one, is dominant, especially for 
all goods that are mass produced or where the consumers do not regularly 
check for the object’s authenticity.
•• The removal and reapplying of authentic security features remain a threat in 
all automated product authentication systems if not explicitly addressed by 
binding the product and the label. However, because acquiring and reapply-
ing authentic labels are costly, this attack does not threaten authentication 
systems in large scales.
•• The cloning and imitation of security features are the most obvious attack 
that a product authentication system has to resist. As the underlying problem 
of counterfeits is that the products themselves can be cloned, the first line of 
defense is to integrate such security features into products that are hard to 
be replicated.
The benefits of RFID compared to old authentication technologies include 
nonline-of-sight reading, item-level identification, the nonstatic nature of security 
features, and cryptographic resistance against cloning. RFID systems, in general, 

80 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
comprise transponders, readers, or interrogators and an online database, some-
times referred to as the back-end server. In many applications, RFID transponders 
are already being used for authentication, for example, in access control. Although 
RFID product authentication is very close to RFID access control, when it comes to 
the used authentication protocols, product authentication needs specific solutions 
because of the specific application requirements.
Resisting cloning and forgery is one of the most important security proper-
ties of authentication tags. The simplest cloning attack against an RFID tag only 
requires reading the tag serial number and programming the same number into an 
empty tag. There are two essential obstacles against this kind of replication. First, 
even the low-cost transponders (e.g., EPC Class-1, Generation-2) have a unique 
factory programmed chip serial number [or transponder ID (TID)] that is similar 
to the unique MAC address of PC network cards. Cloning a TID would therefore 
also require access to hardware manufacturing.
The second obstacle against cloning is to place read-protected secrets on tags 
and to check if the tag knows these secrets, for example, by cryptographic chal-
lenge-response protocols. Even though this can provide a significant improvement 
to a tag’s ability to resist cloning, many ways remain in which to conduct a clon-
ing attack against a single tag. These attacks include side-channel attack, reverse-
engineering and cryptanalysis, brute-force attack, physical attacks, and different 
active attacks against the tag. 
In addition, shared secrets–based product authentication approaches are al-
ways vulnerable to data theft, where the secret PIN codes or encryption schemes of 
valid products are stolen or sold out by insiders, which would enable criminals to 
create phony tags. This scenario is especially interesting for adversaries because it 
would allow them to clone a large number of tags.
Other RFID security issues that have to be considered in product authentica-
tion comprise resistance against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In general, DoS 
causes loss of service to users. Even though it cannot be used to fool the product 
authentication, it can pose a threat for the overall process. In RFIDs, DoS attack 
can be conducted, for example, by jamming the readers with hidden blocker tags 
or by desynchronizing tag and a database entry.
We assume that product authentication is normally performed under the sur-
veillance of authorized personnel or by the customer, which narrows down the pos-
sible attack scenarios. Therefore, active attacks, in which the adversary would need 
to participate in the authentication session and use special devices in the proximity 
of the reader (e.g., replay, relay, and man-in-the-middle attack), are not considered 
as realistic threats against RFID product authentication.
3.5.3  Agriculture and Animals 
RFID is already used to manage commercial livestock by farmers, improving farm-
ing efficiency and allowing them to be traced back to their origins (in case of dis-
ease). The technology can also be used to effectively develop a track-and-trace of 
meat, to keep track of pets and their vaccination records, for easy retrieval of pets 
by owners, to identify animals, and to reduce the potential spread of diseases when 
crossing borders (see Figure 3.11). 

3.5  RFID Applications 
81
The technology is also being used for fish and wild game to track migrations, 
breeding patterns, population, and so forth and to prevent poaching and illegal 
exporting of endangered species and ivory tusks.
Researchers have noticed recent cases of cannibalism in polar bears in the Arc-
tic (something that is previously undocumented) and further investigation will be 
required. A study on polar bears in Alaska, by members of the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS), shows that some types of RFID tags can be read from as far away 
as 1,500 feet, while the reader is in motion (in this case, a helicopter). 
In terms of savings, the RFID ear tags cost $35 and the battery lasts 5 years. In 
comparison, the older satellite radio collars cost $4,000, with batteries only lasting 
2 years. Obviously, the radio collars can be tracked at a greater distance. 
3.5.4  Intelligent Transportation Systems
Traffic congestion in the largest cities of the world is a growing problem that has 
to be taken into account seriously, not only by governments, but also by the pri-
vate sector. After an extensive survey and different alternatives being analyzed, the  
concept of intelligent vehicle/highway system (IVHS) is proposed as the best solu-
tion [17]. 
IVHS has been called by different names depending on the developing area 
and the application purposes—intelligent transportation system (ITS), intelligent 
cars and automated highways systems (AHS), and automated vehicle/highway  
system (AVHS) are just some of the different names basically describing the same 
concept.
IVHS is an intelligent transportation system in which vehicles and highways 
will exchange information through a two-way communication system (see Figure 
3.12). The automated highways will have a set of lanes on which vehicles with spe-
cialized sensors and wireless communications systems could travel under computer 
control at closely spaced intervals. This type of arrangement is called a platoon. 
The vehicles could continuously exchange information with other vehicles and 
traffic-control centers about speed, acceleration, braking, obstacles, road condi-
tions, and other vehicle data. Sensor data can be processed and sent back to each 
vehicle, guaranteeing a continuous exchange of information.
The highway system will know the destinations and planned routes of indi-
vidual vehicles. In that way the system can coordinate traffic flow more efficient-
ly, reduce speed fluctuations, monitor unsafe vehicle operation and traffic shock 
waves, maximize highway capacity, and minimize avoidable traffic congestion. In 
Figure 3.11  Glass transponder for the identification of animals (and humans).

82 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
addition, the system will respond rapidly to changing highway conditions. The 
vehicles might use several types of devices to sense its environment, such as magne-
tometers, visual sensors, infrared sensors, laser sensors, and accelerometers. Each 
vehicle has to have a powerful computer to process sensory data and the informa-
tion that come from the traffic control centers.
IVHS America has become the coordinating and planning entity in which the 
individual activities of state and local authorities, companies, and universities have 
a central orientation for constructing a national IVHS program. VERTIS (Vehicle, 
Road, and Traffic Intelligence Society) in Japan and ERTICO (European Road 
Transport Implementation Coordination Organization) perform similar activities 
as major coordinators of the intelligent vehicle/highway system programs.
Some proposals have suggested using RFID technology for positioning [18]. 
This technique, however, would not replace GPS; rather, it is a complementary 
technique. RFID tags need to be installed on a road in a manner that could maxi-
mize the coverage and the accuracy of positioning. On installation, necessary in-
formation such as coordinates of the location in which the tag is installed needs to 
be written on each tag. The accuracy of this position information is very critical for 
this technique to be successful. The position information can be acquired by using 
differential GPS (DGPS) or some other methods, which would take much longer 
time to compute the location. 
Contrary to GPS in navigation systems in which real-time positioning is neces-
sary, the time for getting the accurate information would be tolerated since this 
computation would take place once. Vehicles then need to be equipped with an 
RFID reader that can communicate with the tags on a road. 
No matter how accurate the RFID positioning is, it only gives the position 
where the tags are. Therefore, the vehicles need also to be equipped with a GPS 
receiver and inertial sensors such as a gyroscope for positioning when there are no 
tags around. While driving, the vehicles constantly monitor the presence of a tag. 
On detection, the reader retrieves the information from the tag including a lane

marker. The deployment should be done step by step; places such as tunnels from 
which getting GPS signal is not an option should be the first, intersections the next, 
then urban areas, and then nationwide. Due to this nationwide scale, governmental 
actions would be necessary.
3.5.5  Document Management
Books and other materials are identified with smart labels that carry a unique, tam-
perproof ID code. Librarians at the circulation desk and patrons read the tags with 
RFID readers to check items in and out. The process is faster and more accurate 
than with traditional optical bar code labels. Some economic facts that help justify 
installing this system are as follows:
•• A lost book typically costs a library around $45;
•• An average library can have as many as 22 million items circulating each 
year;
•• With RFID smart labels on items, check in and check out saves 1.5 minutes 
per transaction.
Besides the unique ID number, these labels can be programmed with additional 
information, such as type of media and storage location. In the retail RFID space, 
the EPCglobal suite of RFID specifications mandates that tags support an irrevo-
cable kill command. In the library setting, however, tags must be reused to check in 
loaned items. Irrevocably killing a tag is not an option. The tag has to be rewrite-
able so libraries do not have to replace a book’s digital identification tag when 
updating a book’s status or flagging a book for reservation. Libraries are finding 
new ways to take advantage of tagged items, such as gathering statistics on what 
items are most often used.
Aside from the libraries, RFID can also be used to improve the management of 
important individual document files in industries such as insurance companies and 
law offices, where the loss of such files can cause severe problems. RFID improves 
the tracking of documents so that files can be quickly located and document work-
flow more easily tracked. 
Each file is tagged with a smart label that contains a unique ID and human-
readable information. The file description is entered into a database along with 
its tracking number. The file can be assigned certain parameters such as expira-
tion date, permitted movement, and persons authorized to see it. Over time, the 
database can build up an audit trail of the handling and workflow history of each 
document file.
3.5.6  Pharmaceutical and Health Care Industry
A number of pilots are already under way in the pharmaceutical supply chain and 
health care markets for item-level management. Although much remains to be 
learned about the efficiencies and safeguards that can result from the use of RFID 
solutions in these markets, companies implementing RFID pilots are experiencing 
process improvements and safety benefits today. Suppliers to the medical industry, 

84 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
from garment to surgical instrument providers, as well as health care institutions 
managing blood and tissue sample processing, are investigating the viability and 
reliability of HF technology solutions, and they are seeing significant returns in the 
field [19].
3.5.6.1  Tracking Medications
State and federal laws have been enacted in order to address the increasing threat to 
public health posed by counterfeit drugs. At the federal level, the U.S. FDA enacted 
the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which went into effect in December 
2006, with a mandated requirement that every drug must have a full pedigree.4 
In addition, many states are enacting their own pedigree laws. Florida’s pedigree 
law, which enables companies to select either paper or electronic record keeping, 
requires full documentation of the drug from the manufacturer to the store, requir-
ing each shipment to be accompanied by the amount of the drug, dosage form and 
strength, lot numbers, name and address of each owner with owner signature, and 
complete shipping information. 
California’s pedigree law, which specifies the requirement for an electronic 
pedigree, went into effect on January 1, 2007. Many other states are considering 
similar laws. 
The need and value of RFID in the pharmaceutical industry are well recognized 
and documented. With the need to meet U.S. federal and state regulatory compli-
ance in the very near future, many companies in the pharmaceutical industry are 
aggressively seeking to implement RFID now (Figure 3.13). Leading companies 
have already defined critical strategic and business needs, as well as the system 
specifications that will meet those needs. These requirements are some of the most 
demanding and stringent of any RFID applications to date. 
For pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, RFID will provide a so-
lution for three critical issues: improvement of counterfeit protection; regulatory 
compliance by providing the ability to create a complete electronic pedigree, au-
tomatically, without human intervention; and rapid and cost-effective recalls by 
4.	
Pedigree is information required to ensure the security and authenticity of a drug as it travels through each 
step in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

providing the ability to instantly and automatically identify the location of product 
that must be recalled. 
3.5.6.2  Locating Tissue Samples
What was previously a painstaking and time-consuming task of locating and identi-
fying samples can now be completed quickly with a simple pass of an RFID reader 
over the existing inventory.
Tissue-sample processing labs are using miniature HF tags to create efficien-
cies in locating single test tube samples among the hundreds in the laboratory at 
any given time. The RFID tag contains a unique serial number as well as memory 
that can be read, modified, and protected. The serial number is then linked to a 
database containing critical information on each tissue sample, including patient 
data and tissue treatments. Using a fixed desktop or lightweight handheld reader 
at a distance of a few inches, researchers and laboratory technicians searching for 
a specific sample on a tray of 100 tubes can quickly and easily read all of the tags 
in less than a few seconds. 
3.5.6.3  Patient Identification and Care
The RFID-based system allows medical professionals to use RFID-enabled wrist-
bands to identify patients and to update their status, location, and medical informa-
tion in the system’s electronic whiteboard automatically. The Navy5 implemented 
a new system to replace a labor-intensive, entirely manual system consisting of pen 
and paper, cardboard tags, and a centrally located whiteboard to show patient 
movement throughout the hospital. With the new electronic system, each patient 
receives an HF-enabled wristband, on which basic identification information is 
stored. 
Medical professionals use a handheld RFID device to read the unique ID num-
ber, and to add or change data to create a digital treatment record that travels with 
the patient as he or she is moved throughout the facility. Using a wireless LAN, 
patient information is transferred to an electronic patient management system, fur-
ther eliminating manual reentry of data at a central computer terminal.
3.5.6.4  Matching Blood Samples to Patients
In the trial, the doctor or nurse taking the blood sample enters the patient informa-
tion into a handheld RFID device at the start of the blood sampling process. This 
data is stored on an RFID label (HF type) on the patient’s blood sample tube and 
can be read by fixed readers and automatically transferred to the facility’s database, 
enabling a fully automated process and replacing an entirely manual one. In addi-
tion, because the patient data is entered in electronic format at the beginning of 
the process, the integration of results into the patients’ records is quick and simple. 
5.	
The U.S. Navy is using HF technology to more efficiently track the status and location of hundreds of 
wounded soldiers and airmen, prisoners of war, refugees, and others arriving for treatment at Fleet Hospi-
tal Three, a 9-acre, 116-bed facility in Southern Iraq.

86 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
Trials have shown significant reductions in administration time, both during 
sampling and laboratory processing.
3.5.6.5  Context-Sensitive Medicine
By using active RFID tags, management of resources becomes more intelligent. 
For example, equipment needing servicing can automatically inform the technician. 
Patient care can be scheduled, and reminders will be sent out exactly when action 
is required. 
The location of equipment, doctors, and patients inside a hospital can be 
tracked in real time. This allows the patients to move around freely while it also 
allows doctors and nurses to tend to more patients.
3.5.7  Indoor Localization for First Responders 
Most of the research and development for indoor localization include that of a 
wireless network that integrates communications, precise tracking, and data telem-
etry, for use in hospital and manufacturing environments. In contrast, the system 
used by first responders is intended for an environment that is potentially much less 
friendly to RF propagation: the in-building environment that may contain smoke, 
dust, or flames.
The technology is intended to leverage advances in ubiquitous RFID tag tech-
nology and in combination with recent advances in miniaturized inertial sensors 
[20]. This research is a joint effort by components of three NIST laboratories: 
the Wireless Communication Technologies Group of the Information Technology 
Laboratory (ITL) and the Fire Fighting Technology Group of the Building and Fire 
Research Laboratory (BFRL) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and the Radio-Frequency 
Fields Group of the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
The most widely used navigation system today is the Global Positioning System 
(GPS), which enables position determination through the measurement of time de-
lays of signals from multiple satellites in known (moving) positions; the time-delay 
measurements are based on cross-correlating received satellite signals with local 
replicas to identify the signals’ digital code position in time relative to the common 
reference. The difficulty in using GPS indoors and in urban canyons is that the line 
of sight to the GPS satellites is obscured or severely attenuated. Without four good 
satellite signals, the GPS position solution is inaccurate. In addition, with weak sig-
nals, the GPS receiver continually loses lock and must spend an inordinate amount 
of time in attempting to acquire the signals. 
The research aims to find the way to implement a low-cost, reliable means for 
tracking firefighters and other first responders inside buildings, where navigation 
using GPS is not reliable or the GPS signal may have been disabled temporarily to 
prevent exploitation by terrorists. Even if the GPS signals are not blocked or ob-
scured for tactical advantage, the reception of GPS signals inside most buildings is 
not reliable. 
Prior to the establishment of GPS many techniques and devices for navigation 
have been used. Today’s navigation devices implement some very old navigation 
techniques, such as dead reckoning and waypoint navigation. 

3.5  RFID Applications 
87
Dead reckoning (DR) is the process of estimating position by advancing a 
known position using course, speed, time, and distance to be traveled, in other 
words, figuring out where a person will be at a certain time if he or she holds the 
planned speed, time, and course. The usefulness of the technique depends upon 
how accurately speed and course can be maintained in the air and on the sea, and 
the uncertainty of the DR position grows with time, so that it is necessary to check 
the position regularly with a fix of some kind, perhaps an RFID tag. 
It has been noted that 0.6–2 GHz is the best frequency band for propagation 
inside the buildings.
3.5.8  Passive Keyless Entry
When in 1993, a major German insurance company put up pressure to either pro-
tect vehicles against massively increasing theft or else renounce to full insurance 
coverage, nobody believed that RFID as a then-emerging technology would see one 
of its first major successes, still unbeaten in numbers by any other application today. 
Objection was raised as to the reliability of potential systems and their suitability 
in an automotive environment; and, of course, the lack of standards in what then 
seemed to be a collection of proprietary systems was seen to be a major obstacle. An 
extremely fast but substantial development effort was undertaken by a few power-
ful automotive industry suppliers, resulting in a miniaturized ignition key system 
and its car lock transceiver counterpart to be fitted to new cars a year later. 
This first generation system, still fitted to certain models of most major car 
makers, consisted of a 64-bit read-only, rod- or brick-type transponder, embed-
ded in the ignition key of the vehicle and a transceiver antenna with its electronics 
package on printed circuit board (PCB), integrated around and behind the lock. 
When the presented key does not match one of the prestored codes, the protection 
consists of safely cutting power supply to the starter, the fuel pump, the system igni-
tion, and other system elements required for the vehicle’s operation during driving 
for the case. 
Specifications for the miniaturized transponders were very stringent, requir-
ing maximum read distance in a metal-loaded environment over industry-practice 
thermal ranges with only a few parts-per-million failure rate allowed. Three main-
stream systems were adopted by the majority of the automotive industry and have 
since been fitted to millions of new cars with great success, and immobilizers today, 
for example, in Europe, are part of the normal equipment of cars.
Hands-free passive keyless entry (PKE) applications require bidirectional com-
munication between the base station and transponder units. The base unit inside 
the vehicle transmits a low-frequency command that searches for a transponder 
in the field. Once located, the transponder in the vehicle owner’s possession then 
automatically responds to the base unit. The base unit then unlocks the car doors 
if a valid authentication response is received. 
The company’s couriers use an automatic keyless entry and ignition system that 
has RFID transponders embedded within a Velcro wristband. The FedEx system 
uses RFID readers mounted at each of the four doors to the delivery vehicle and a 
reader mounted on the right side of the steering column near the ignition switch. 
When the courier places his or her transponder wristband within 6 inches of 
the readers, the transponder’s code is compared to ones in the system’s memory. If 

88 
��������������������������������
Automatic Identification Systems
it is a match, the door unlocks for 5 seconds. The courier simply pulls on the door 
handle to enter the vehicle, while the three remaining doors stay securely locked to 
prevent unauthorized entry. To start the vehicle, the courier pushes a button on the 
right side of the steering column. The courier pushes another button near the start 
button to turn off the vehicle.
3.5.9  Military Applications
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) became involved in RFID during the 1990s 
due to the identification of supply chain challenges. During Operation Desert Storm 
in 1991, logistics and materiel distribution were major problems. 
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) became known for mountains of un-
opened shipping containers in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert. The lack 
of supply chain visibility required 25,000 of the 40,000 containers to be opened 
in order to identify their contents. A Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
grant was awarded to identify whether RFID could help prevent similar supply 
chain problems in the future, resulting in several initiatives over the next few years.
Evaluations of the DLS’s effectiveness during Operation Desert Storm focused 
on the high cost of the DLA’s supply chain. In 1995, the Joint Total Asset Visibility 
office was formed with a charter to provide asset visibility in-storage, in-process, 
and in-transit to optimize the DoD’s operational capability. This had several re-
sults. First, it organized all RFID supply chain initiatives under one office, instead 
of being managed by individual armed forces or distribution depots. Second, it 
provided a source for funding future RFID initiatives. By 2004, the DLA had spent 
over $100 million on RFID initiatives; this level of funding would not have been 
available under the previous organizational structure. Finally, the implementation 
plan tied RFID usage to the overall strategic goals mandated by the department’s 
charter. By 2004, the DoD had joined EPCglobal.
When it comes to RFID, the DoD and the armed services have learned a thing 
or two from private industry. The DoD, for instance, is adding passive RFID tags 
to cartons and pallet, and rather than reinvent the wheel, the DoD is working with 
established industry technologies. Similarly, the armed services are implementing 
active RFID solutions to track mobile assets, like containers in the field and work 
in process. The Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2007 has had a total of 
$17 million added for projects either directly or indirectly related to RFID [21].
According to the DoD’s policy, which was finalized and released in July 2004, 
by January 1, 2005, suppliers had to put passive RFID tags on all individual cases, 
all cases packaged within a pallet, and all pallets of packaged troop rations, cloth-
ing, individual equipment and tools, personal items, and weapons systems repair 
parts and components shipped to the two DLA distribution centers. 
The Tobyhanna Army Depot, for instance, is using a Real-time Locating Sys-
tem (RTLS) to streamline the repair and overhaul of defense electronic systems. 
The Army maintains, repairs, and overhauls command, control, communications, 
intelligence, and reconnaissance systems at the 1.9-million-square-foot refurbish-
ment center in Pennsylvania, including the Army’s radar system, which detects and 
tracks enemy mortar and artillery shells in Afghanistan and Iraq. These systems 
are shipped from the field to Tobyhanna. There, each system is disassembled, over-
hauled, and tested before being shipped out into the field again. 

3.5  RFID Applications 
89
The RTLS allows Tobyhanna to track hundreds of components during the pro-
cess that might otherwise get misplaced in the massive facility. The system will ex-
pedite the refurbishment process, enabling the Army to return systems to the field 
up to 35 days sooner than in the past [22].
The U.S. Army is developing an RFID system to track weapons usage. In an 
effort to make sure that ground vehicles’ weapons are properly maintained, Benét 
Laboratories is working on a system using sensors and passive RFID tags to record 
the number of rounds fired. The first vehicle to demonstrate the sensor system will 
be the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank. The sensor systems will include microelectro-
mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors integrated with RFID tags to help the vehicle’s 
operator track how many times a weapon has been fired. This allows the gunner 
to determine whether it can be depended on to function properly. To date, vehicle 
and weapon operators have been required to log manually, on paper, how many 
times a weapon has been fired and the types of munitions used and then bring that 
information to the vehicle maintenance depot.
The first phase of the deployment, which will measure applied force, will focus 
only on using the MEMS sensors to count the rounds fired. However, the MEMS 
sensors will eventually be used to measure a fired round’s physical effects on the 
gun barrel as well, including the intensity of the applied force, heat and vibration. 
This will assist not only in counting the number of rounds fired, but also in record-
ing the physical effects of the type of munitions fired in each instance, resulting in 
an accurate indication of the health and maintenance requirements of the barrel.
An operator can access the weapon-firing count on a tablet PC inside the ve-
hicle. The tablet includes an RFID reader, and its data can be downloaded by Army 
personnel to keep a record of the weapon’s firing history. When a vehicle operator 
prepares the weapon for firing, the reader automatically sends an RF signal ener-
gizing the passive RFID tag, which transmits its unique RFID number and a count 
of each time the weapon has been fired. 
The tablet PC will include integrated data storage, communications, and dis-
play technologies. The MEMS will incorporate an RFID tag and a low-power mi-
croprocessor with limited memory, which would continue to record rounds fired 
even if the rest of the system were to fail [23].
3.5.10  Other RFID Applications
Gillette (which announced in early 2003 that it would purchase 500 million RFID 
tags) has worked with retailers to test smart shelves, as an adjunct to item-level tag-
ging, for inventory control. With a reader on each shelf and a tag on each package 
of razor blades, the data proprietor would always know how many packages are on 
the shelves, without having to count them.
Michelin has begun fleet-testing for RFID for passenger and light truck tires 
(Figure 3.14). Each tire’s unique ID number will be associated in an external data-
base with the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the car on which it is mount-
ed, and with information describing when and where the tire was made, its maxi-
mum inflation pressure, its size, and so on. The transponder consists of a UHF/
SHF RFID chip, circuit board, and two antennas. The antenna leads must be tuned 
to resonate at 868 and 960 MHz when cured into the tire. The current design has

a nominal recommended tuned length of around 61 mm end to end. Exact tuned 
length will always depend on tire type.
Casinos are putting RFID tags in chips to block counterfeiting, identify stolen 
chips, and track gamblers’ play. An Italian manufacturer has introduced a washing 
machine equipped to read RFID washing instruction tags in clothing.
A German supermarket, for a brief time, inserted RFID tags in supermarket 
loyalty cards, which gave the store the capability, while someone carrying the loy-
alty card was in the store, to pull up his or her entire buying history without his or 
her being aware that the query was taking place and without any other basis for the 
store’s knowing who he or she was.
It is possible to imagine a whole lot of uses, indeed, for a technology in which 
objects can be uniquely identified without direct contact. This is the ideal technol-
ogy if you want the milk in your refrigerator to notify you (or your supermarket) 
if you have failed to drink it by its pull date. Indeed, you could tie a slightly more 
elaborate tag to a nanosensor that checks for spoilage directly.
Students in an Osaka, Japan, elementary school will be getting RFID chips in 
their schoolbags, name tags, or clothing, to be read by readers installed in school 
entrances and exits. 
The University of Washington’s Brockman Memorial Tree Tour uses RFID 
and PDA technologies [24]. The combined use of these technologies increases the 
ease of locating and positively identifying each tree along the lengthy, spacious 
tour around the campus. Each tree is individually profiled including details such 
as origin, data planted, types of flowers, and other pertinent information. A map, 
located at the rear, visually locates each tree by its unique number. Originally, a 
nameplate was attached to each tree along the tree tour for quick identification 
from a distance. Over time, however, many nameplates have been removed, dam-
aged, or destroyed due to weather, growth, or vandalism. The optimum solution 
proposed was to embed RFID tags within the trees and retrieve the ID numbers via 
a tree-penetrating RF signal. The updated tour information is professionally read 
and recorded into PC-formatted sound files. The files are then embedded within the 
electronic tree tour version. 
At the click of a button, the text for each tree is played back through the on-
board speaker on the PDA device. The advantage is that the user can simultaneous-
ly observe the tree and receive audio information. Also, the high-volume capability 
of the chosen portable information device enables groups to share a single system 
with one person designated as a chief navigator and tree scanner. In the electronic 
version of the tree tour, a map with significantly higher detail is displayed on a PDA 
device with a crisp color screen at a magnification roughly four times that of the 
paper version.

The industry’s biggest score to date, however, could be in the works in Europe, 
where rumor has it that the European Central Bank is working with vendors on 
weaving RFID into the fabric of its bank notes. The technology, most probably 
for incorporation into larger bills, would enable money to carry its own history. 
Hence, it would become more difficult for kidnappers to ask for unmarked bills. It 
would also enable law-enforcement agencies to follow the money in illegal transac-
tions. The U.S. government is said to have expressed interest as well. 
A 2.45-GHz, high-frequency, ultrasmall antenna, embedded in an ultrasmall 
IC chip (a µ-chip or mu-chip), for RF identification is shown in Figure 3.15. An 
ultrasmall (0.3 × 0.3 × 0.06 mm) RFID chip, called the µ-chip, has been developed 
for use in a wide range of individual recognition applications. The chip is designed 
to be thin enough to be applied to the paper and paper-like media widely used in 
retailing to create certificates that have monetary value, as well as to tokens. It was 
designed and fabricated using 0.18-µm standard CMOS technology. 
A conventional general-purpose type µ-chip needs an external antenna to 
transmit the 128-bit ID number inside the chip. In this new type of µ-chip, only a 
small IC chip is required for batteryless data transmission operations, because the 
embedded antenna on the chip is able to receive electromagnetic power from the 
reader [25].
This miniaturization enables RFID devices to be easily inserted inside a bank 
note or gift card. Furthermore, this feature also enables the identification devices to 
be attached to a narrow surface, or inside thin materials. The embedded antenna is 
formed by using gold-plating technology, widely used in the fabrication process of 
packaging connection terminals on semiconductor wafers. Therefore, the antenna 
is not only ultrasmall, but also very easily made on the wafer by the fine and batch 
antenna-forming process.

Chinese jails have used RFID to upgrade security by fitting its 6,000 prison-
ers with RFID wristbands. The new prisoner identification program at Jiangsu 
Longton Jail in the Nanjing Jiangsu province uses 13.56-MHz ISO 15693 tags and 
readers. Each wristband contains a smart label with encrypted data including the 
inmate’s name, ID number, and security level. As inmates move around the prison, 
they present their wristband to a reader that records their identity and the time they 
entered and left a particular area. Guards are equipped with handheld readers for 
real-time spot checks and roll calls. Prisoners are required to check into the system 
for roll call at various times during the day, and if an inmate is not recorded by 
the system at the appropriate time an alarm indicates which prisoner has not been 
identified. Guards can view that prisoner’s last check-in point and locate him or 
her quickly. 
To deal with security threats posed by the volume of containers shipping in the 
United States, the U.S. Customs Service is proposing the Container Security Initia-
tive (CSI) to identify high-risk containers and secure them with tamper-detection 
systems. The initiative aims to expedite processing of containers prescreened at 
points of embarkation in overseas megaports participating in the initiative. 
The CSI’s basic goal is to first engage the ports that send the highest volumes 
of container traffic into the United States, as well as the governments in these lo-
cations, in a way that will facilitate detection of potential problems at the earliest 
possible time. To meet this requirement, high-end RFID tags could periodically 
monitor electronic seals on the containers during transit. This class of application 
requires tags that can integrate sensor management electronics, such as analog-to-
digital converters, and digital data interfaces. Tampering can also be detected in 
real time, and the tags, as the lowest level of a multitier architecture, can relay data 
to alert the shippers or customs authorities of tampering as it occurs.
Similarly, tags are used extensively to monitor transport of the high-value 
goods in the United States as well as worldwide. For example, Norway is a major 
exporter of salmon, so the RFID tags record the temperature in the containers so 
that the buyer can verify product freshness. This can be especially important when 
the shipments are bound for southern locations such as Italy, Spain, or North Af-
rica. The biosensor will have sensitive biological film coatings that will undergo 
changes in material properties on contact with target pathogens like Salmonella 
and Escherichia coli6.
Ski resorts are using smart label technology in lift tickets and passes. They not 
only authenticate the ticket as genuine and valid for that date and time, but also 
increase the traffic-flow rate on the lifts since passes can be read on the fly. The 
reader signals if there is a problem with a particular ticket. Skiers pass quickly 
through lift gates without having to remove their gloves to swipe a card, making 
their experience more pleasurable. 
Many nightclubs use a similar system for tagging their patrons and making it 
easy to exit and reenter the club at any time during the night.

Escherichia coli (commonly abbreviated E. coli and named after Theodor Escherich) is a Gram-negative 
rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. Most 
E. coli strains are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning in humans and are occasionally 
responsible for product recalls.

3.6.1  RuBee
RuBee is the commercial name for what is officially known as long-wavelength ID 
(LWID) as defined by the IEEE. The moniker was given to the technology by engi-
neers at Miami-based Visible Assets, who coined the name for LWID technology 
after the hit 1967 Rolling Stones’ song, “Ruby Tuesday.”
RuBee networks operate at long wavelengths and accommodate low-cost radio 
tags at ranges to 100 feet. RuBee networks and tags are distinguished from most 
RFID tags in that they are unaffected by liquids and can be used underwater and 
underground. RuBee devices will be able to be used as implantable medical sensors 
having a 10- to 15-year battery life, depending on the number of reads and writes. 
The ability of RuBee tags to maintain performance around steel, so they work well 
when steel shelves are present, removes a key obstacle for low-cost deployment of 
RFID in retail, item-level tracking environments.
Tags based on the RuBee technology can be either active or passive, and all 
operate at a low frequency of 132 kHz, rather than the HF (13.56 MHz) or UHF 
(916 MHz) ranges used in the most widely deployed RFID systems today. Because 
low frequencies have significantly smaller bandwidth for data transfer, relative to 
higher frequencies, only about 6 to 10 RuBee tags (active or passive) can be read 
per second, while several dozen passive HF tags and several hundred passive UHF 
tags can be interrogated in that same span of time. This is not foreseen as a problem 
because RuBee users are interested in tracking the locations of assets rather than 
the passage of fast-moving tagged goods through portals, for which passive UHF 
tags are optimized. 
The new IEEE RuBee standard, P1902.1 “RuBee Standard for Long Wave-
length Network Protocol,” will allow for networks encompassing thousands of 
radio tags operating below 450 kHz and represents candidate specification, which 
the standards group is using as a starting point for the future standardization of 
the technology. 
IEEE P1902.1 will offer a real-time, tag-searchable protocol, using IPv4 ad-
dresses and subnet addresses linked to asset taxonomies that run at speeds of 300 
to 9,600 baud. RuBee networks are managed by a low-cost Ethernet enabled rout-
er. Individual tags and tag data may be viewed as a stand-alone Web server from 
anywhere in the world. Each RuBee tag, if properly enabled, can be discovered and 
monitored over the World Wide Web using popular search engines (e.g., Google).
RuBee is the only wireless technology presently approved by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Energy (DoE) for use in high security, top-secret areas in which RFID, Wi-
Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee have all been banned [26].
In July 2006, the FDA classified 1902.1 as a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) Class 
1 device in medical visibility applications. In May 2007, a peer-reviewed study was 
published by the Mayo Clinic showing that RuBee has no effect on pacemakers or 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators. A second Mayo study has shown RuBee 
has no electromagnetic interference or electromagnetic compatibility in the operat-
ing room. RuBee tags are also expected to meet the Intrinsically Safe ANSI 913-88 
standard in a Zone 0 or Zone 1 explosive atmosphere as well as the DoD HERO 
(Hazards of Electro Magnetic Radiation to Ordinance) standards.

3.6.2  Visible Light Tags
Visible light tags use visible light instead of radio waves for the communication 
between tags and readers. Visible light tags can, for example, be used in a hospital 
where the use of radio waves is restricted or used underwater. The read range and 
scope can be modified by using optical devices, and people can visually see the com-
munication range/scope since it uses visible light. 
They are upper compatible with ISO15693, can replace part of existing RFID 
infrastructure, and could be used in hospitals, underwater, and other places where 
radio communication does not work. Obviously, visible light tags are not restricted 
by the radio interference, so there is no need to obtain a license, and actually they 
can be installed in an environment that is already crowded with RFID readers. 
3.6.3  RFID and Printable Electronics
The term printable electronics refers to circuitry created out of conductive inks us-
ing a wide variety of printing technologies, old and new [27]. Much of the buzz in 
printable electronics is about ink-jet printing offering cost-effective device creation 
in very small volumes. But there are many other ways of creating printable electron-
ics. These include: nanoimprint lithography (NIL), offset lithography, gravure, and 
flexographic printing. 
Different applications may be suited to different printing technologies, since 
each application has its own requirements and each printing technology has its 
own advantages and disadvantages. For example, ink-jet printing holds out the 
prospect of the economic creation of customized/small production run circuits, 
while conventional printing processes using masks are well suited to something 
closer to mass production. Nanoimprint lithography, a technique that may or may 
not be considered part of the printed electronics sector, is probably the only pro-
duction approach considered today that might genuinely be considered to be ca-
pable of creating features at the nanoscale.
The ability to cost-effectively create circuitry as part of other printed products 
is finding early use in greeting cards, but could become a big revenue generator 
through the success of printed RFIDs and smart packaging. It is possible to imagine 
some future smart packaging product, entirely created by multiple in-line print-
ing processes, that encompasses high quality graphics, RFIDs, sensors, and even a 
small display to show pricing as it varies. 
3.6.4  RFID and Mobile Phone Integration
RFID can be combined with mobile phone technologies by inserting either a tran-
sponder or a reader into a smart phone. A smart phone featuring a transponder 
connects to the wireless network and communicates with RFID readers, while a 
smart phone featuring a reader also connects to a wireless network but to retrieve 
RFID tag information. The smart phone transponders transfer their data to readers 
over the phone network. 
Communication between transponder and reader must be secured by crypto-
graphic means because RFID too poses the risks of virus and hacker attacks. As 
with RFID in general, communication between transponder and reader depends

on the range. All information is stored in the wireless network’s central database. 
Smart phones with RFID readers can be used for detecting RFID-tagged products’ 
Web sites via the wireless network for additional information on materials, origin, 
and so forth, locating the coordinates of anything or anyone that has been RFID 
tagged; for retrieving information from tagged items (computers, cars, furniture, 
ads); and for occasionally updating this information via the RFID reader. 
RFID tags can also be used to call people. Combining RFID with cellular tech-
nology enables instant access to information concerning items, which leads to im-
proved services, work efficiency, and performance. RFID provides direct, up-to-
date data and diminishes manual typing of passwords, keys, and codes. Overall, 
RFID combined with mobile technology facilitates processes the same way RFID 
does in general. 
3.7  Review Questions and Problems
1.	 If RFID has been around so long and is so great, why are only a few com-
panies using it? Discuss at least two main reasons for the slow deployment 
rate of RFID systems. 
2.	 Is RFID better than using bar codes? Will RFID ever completely replace bar 
codes?
3.	 Figure 3.16 represents flexible substrate. What is an importance of materi-
als like this one in the development of the RFID technology?
4.	 Over the last 10 years, a concept of smart skin has been under develop-
ment. This skin consists of an array of force sensing cells (i.e., sensels) that 
can measure the spatial distribution and magnitude of forces perpendicular 
to the sensing area. Tactile sensors have been the subject of extensive re-
search for use in robotic applications. 
	
  Recently, researchers have also developed a tattoo-like film that would 
allow doctors to monitor a patient’s vital signs without the wiring and elec-
trodes, just by using embedded electronic sensors in a film thinner than the

diameter of a human hair and then placing it on a polyester backing. In ad-
dition to monitoring heart rate and temperature, the device could monitor 
brain waves, aid muscle movement, sense the larynx for speech, emit heat 
to help heal wounds, and perhaps even be made touch-sensitive and placed 
on artificial limbs.
	
  Discuss different applications of this concept. What problems do you 
foresee in long term in medical applications? What about the use in AmI 
and other smart systems? How about sports (for example, intensity and 
duration of body stress)? How about the idea of the smart skin embedded 
in the floor and used to identify people by analyzing their footstep force 
profiles?
5.	 Using RFID in the pharmaceutical industry could prevent most of the 1.25 
million adverse reactions and 7,000 patient deaths that occur annually in 
the United States as a result of drug errors, according to the Meta Group 
Consultancy. Discuss the issue.
6.	 Transponder systems equipped with one or more sensors are able to mea-
sure continuously or time-discreet physical values such as temperature, 
pressure, or acceleration. Measurements and data storage outside the elec-
tromagnetic field of the reader are only possible if an energy source such as 
a battery or solar cell is available.
	
  A hard hat, as shown in Figure 3.17, worn by building workers or mo-
torcyclists, has been supplied with an RF tag and a sensor network with 
three acceleration sensors [28]. The maximum acceleration values and their 
distribution can be measured in case of an accident. With a reader, it is 
possible to read out these measurements quickly. Try to envision other ap-
plications of wireless sensors where human lives could be protected and/or 
saved.

7.	 There are four major frequency ranges at which RFID systems operate. As 
a rule of thumb, low-frequency systems are distinguished by short reading 
ranges, slow read speeds, and lower cost. Higher-frequency RFID systems 
are used where longer read ranges and fast reading speeds are required, 
such as for vehicle tracking and automated toll collection. Microwave re-
quires the use of active RFID tags. 
	
  Analyze Table 3.1 and answer the following questions:
	
a.	 You are planning an RFID system for tracking the location of people 
within the building. What frequency band(s) would you consider for this 
application? Elaborate your answer.
	
b.	 You are planning an RFID system for counting a large number of fast-
moving and cheap products on the conveyer belt. What frequency band(s) 
would you consider for this application? Elaborate your answer.
	
c.	 You are planning to deploy RFID system, but the environment already 
contains a large WLAN network with many users. What RFID bands may 
not be suitable for your system? Elaborate your answer.
8.	 Generally speaking, people are concerned about the social consequences 
of a world full of embedded wireless implants, tags and readers. WBANs 
are a part of AmI; monitoring and tracking of implanted devices outside of 
the designed purpose are a critical issue, as they provide details about the 
actual person. 
	
  The WSN and BAN are the necessary technology for the development of 
the concept of AmI where users (patients) are provided services depending 
on their context. Society may need laws to specify who can access personal 
data logs and for what purpose. In Europe, the Data Protection Act already 
limits access to computer records of this kind, and the United States should 
probably enact similar legislation.
	
  What are your thoughts on the application of AmI for medical purposes? 
Should people be concerned with unexpected and undesired side effects in 
the attempt to improve human lives using the latest technology? Should we 
even continue with the development of the AmI? Write a short essay and 
provide arguments that support your answer.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
4.1  Regional Regulations and Spectrum Allocations
The growing need for interoperable products demands both the harmonization of 
regulatory controls on spectrum usage and international standards to support com-
patibility or interoperability of RFID systems. These are important factors when 
considering identification and data capture solutions that are required to operate 
in different countries and/or require compatibility for the purposes of data capture 
and transfer. 
RFID data carriers (tags) and associated systems are generally considered to be 
part of a general category of radio-based short-range devices (SRDs) designed to 
operate in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that do not require operating 
licenses and do not incur operating fees. The use of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
particularly for radio usage, is carefully controlled and spectrum allocations are 
specified to avoid systems interfering with one another. The license-exempt regions 
of the spectrum are generally allocated for industrial, science, and medical (ISM) 
applications. Unfortunately, the regulations for spectrum usage vary from country 
to country. 
For the user of RFID systems, the expectation is that the necessary regulatory 
requirements will be satisfied. Although transparent to the user, the manufactur-
ers of RFID systems will need to have a detailed understanding of the requisite 
regulations and associated standards and be able to demonstrate to users that their 
products are compliant.
Generally speaking, the manufacturers are required to identify and comply 
with the essential regulations and standards in respect of:
•• Spectrum allocations and associated operating constraints;
•• Health and safety;
•• Electromagnetic compatibility;
•• Avoidance of interference with other spectrum users;
•• Compliance with national interface regulations;
•• Other regulations and directives that may arise from time to time concerning 
system usage.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
Manufacturers may also be required to carry out essential testing for compli-
ance purposes. The necessary requirements to be met will be available from the 
spectrum management authorities in respective countries.
For low frequency (<135 kHz) and high frequency (13.56 MHz), there is a fair 
degree of allowed usage worldwide for RFID purposes. However, at the UHF car-
rier frequency, the situation is more complicated. Differences between the United 
Kingdom and the United States in the allocation of mobile phone usage, for ex-
ample, prevent the use of common carrier frequencies and associated bands. 
Country-specific regulatory controls specify the field strengths and power lev-
els allowable for devices and systems operating at the different carrier frequencies. 
These levels naturally have a determining influence upon the ranges that are achiev-
able for the reactively coupled and propagation coupled systems. It is therefore 
important to establish and confirm what is allowable within the country in which 
the technology is to be used. 
The standardization process and efforts to agree regionalization of frequency 
usage are likely, in the fullness of time, to provide a foundation for wider open sys-
tems exploitation. It must be stressed that considerations for usage of RFID in dif-
ferent countries should include up-to-date information on spectrum allocation and 
constraints on usage obtained from the appropriate regulatory authority within the 
country concerned, as well as any encompassing regulations operating at union and 
international levels.
It is understood that the use of any modern technology requires some form 
of harmonization at the national and international levels. Standardization ensures 
compatibility and interoperability between different manufacturers and technical 
applications. This chapter will deal with the standards landscape and present areas 
for future standardization initiatives. In addition to the spectrum-related initia-
tives, RFID standardization is needed in the following areas:
•• Air interface and protocols: Communication between tags and readers, read-
ers and readers, RFID systems and other wireless communication systems;
•• Data structures: Organization of the data (e.g., on a tag);
•• Conformance: Tests ensuring that products meet the standards;
•• Applications: Use of the technology for a particular purpose. 
The importance of standards cannot be overemphasized for technologies, like 
RFID, that have universal relevance and significant potential for open systems us-
age. In addition, RFID systems generate radio signals that can interfere with other 
radio applications. Therefore, they must comply with regulations that state which 
frequencies may be used and the maximum power of transmission. 
In Europe, the European Radiocommunications Committee (ERC) regulates 
the use of frequencies. In the United States, radio devices have to comply with 
licensing regulations by the FCC’s licensing regulations. RFID systems are not sepa-
rately regulated, but they need to comply with regulations based on the frequency 
used. The regulation of other countries often corresponds to either the U.S. or the 
European regulations. One exception is Japan, which has its own regulation sys-
tem. However, it is often enough just to consider the FCC rules of the United States 
and the European ETSI standards.

4.2  Key Players in RFID Standardization
Various players are involved in working with and standardizing RFID technologies. 
This section aims to present some major players in RFID standardization activities 
and spectrum allocation. 
The Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), an association of 1,600 mem-
bers involved in the automotive and truck manufacturing supply chain, has been 
developing RFID specifications for the automotive industry. A general standard ex-
ists (ARF 156: Application Standard for RFID Devices in the Automotive Industry) 
and is accompanied by several standards dealing with special sectors of the auto-
mobile supply chain, such as AIAG B-1157, a standard to identify tires and wheels 
with RFID. AIAG B-11 has been developed together with EPCglobal. AIAG also 
holds regular conferences on the use of RFID in the automotive industry.
The European Article Numbering (EAN) and the Uniform Code Council 
(UCC), which administers and manages the EAN·UCC standards system in the 
United States and in Canada, launched the Global Tag Initiative (GTAG) in March 
2000. It is a standard that covers UHF RFID technology and data formats. The air 
interface aspects of GTAG have now been merged with ISO 18000 Part 6. EAN 
International and UCC started EPCglobal as a joint venture.
At a European level, the European Radiocommunication Office (ERO) has 
been working on radiocommunications policies and frequency allocation that are 
important to RFID technologies. The ERO is the permanent office that supports 
the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC). This committee, in turn, is the 
telecommunications regulation committee for the European Conference of Postal 
and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). The ERC Decision ERC/DEC 
(01)04 of 2001 addresses the use of nonspecific SRDs, such as RFID, in certain 
UHF frequency bands. 
Other important CEPT regulations related to RFID technologies include CEPT/
ERC 70-03 (relating to the use of SRDs), CEPT T/R 60-01 (low-power radioloca-
tion equipment for detecting movement and for alert, EAS), and CEPT T/R 22-04 
(“Harmonisation of Frequency Bands for Road Transport Information Systems, 
RTI”).
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has also been 
very active in the field of RFID standardization. In 2004, ETSI TG34, the technical 
group for electromagnetic compatibility and radio spectrum matters, completed, 
in cooperation with EPCglobal, the standard ETSI EN 302 208-xx1, for example, 
ETSI EN 302 208-1 V1.3.1 (2010-02): “Electromagnetic Compatibility and Radio 
Spectrum Matters (ERM); Radio Frequency Identification Equipment operating in 
the Band 865 MHz to 868 MHz with power levels up to 2 W; Part 1: Technical 
requirements and methods of measurement.” It allows readers to use more power 
and operate in a wider UHF band. Prior to that, ETSI had already developed the 
ETSI EN 300-220 standard.
1.	
ETSI EN 302 208-2 V1.3.1 (2010-02) is a document that includes improvements to the previous version of 
the standard that take advantage of technical developments within the RFID industry. In particular, this in-
cludes the ability for multiple interrogators to transmit simultaneously on the same channel. This provides 
significant improvements in spectrum efficiency and system performance. As a consequence, listen-before-
talk is no longer a requirement.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is studying RFID technolo-
gies for airline baggage management; a subgroup of the Baggage Working Group 
(BWG) is responsible for this. IATA has already adopted 13.56 MHz and ISO/
IEC 15693 in its “Recommended Practice for Airline Baggage RF Identification” 
(RP1745).
Within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 
the Technical Advisory Group on Machine Readable Travel Documents (TAG/
MRTD) has been working on international travel documents (e.g., a passport or 
visa) containing eye- and machine-readable data. Specifications for the design of 
these travel documents are contained in ICAO Doc 930376. An annex to that doc-
ument contains provisions on contactless integrated circuits, referring in particular 
to the ISO/IEC 14443 standard.
Within the International Committee for Information Technology Standards 
(INCITS), the Technical Committee T6 deals with RFID standardization. T6 has 
developed NCITS 256, an RFID standard for use in item management. INCITS is 
accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
The ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have under-
taken major activities to standardize RFID technologies in various areas. The work 
on RFID standardization in ISO and IEC has been carried out mainly under ISO/
IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) subcommittees 17 (Identification Cards 
and Personal Identification) and 31 (Automatic Identification and Data Capture 
Techniques). Inside of SC31, WG481 is responsible for RFID for Item Manage-
ment. Other groups within the ISO framework that work on RFID topics include 
ISO TC 23/SC 19 (Agricultural Electronics), ISO TC 104/SC 4 (Identification and 
Communication), and ISO/TC204 (Transport Information and Control Systems).
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations’ (UN) 
specialized agency for telecommunications. Two of its three sectors are dealing 
with RFID-related issues: the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) and the Tele-
communication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). As global spectrum coordinator, 
ITU-R plays an essential role in the management of the radio-frequency spectrum. 
It is governing the use of the radio spectrum by some 40 different services around 
the world. ITU-R Study Group 185 is responsible for spectrum management. The 
Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) creates globally agreed and 
globally accepted ICT standards. 
The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is the UN specialized agency for cooperation 
between postal services. The UPU Technical Standards Board has been developing 
standards to use RFID technologies in postal applications for several years. Among 
these standards are: S25-1G (“Data Constructs for the Communication of Infor-
mation on Postal Items, Batches and Receptacles”), S23-1 Part A,B,C,G (RFID) 
and Radio Data Capture (RDC) Systems), UPU RF 0001.2 (“Identification and 
Marking Using RFID Technology: Data Schemes”), UPU Snn-1 (“Identification 
and Marking Using RFID Technology: Reference Architecture and Terminology”), 
and UPU Snn-3 (“Identification and Marking Using RFID: System Requirements 
and Test Procedures”).

4.3  ISO and EPC Approach 
105
4.3  ISO and EPC Approach
Standards and specifications may be set at the international, national, industry, 
or trade association level, and individual organizations may call their own speci-
fications standards. Many industry standards and specifications set by individual 
organizations are based on international standards to make implementation and 
support easier and to provide a wider choice of available products. Standards can 
be applied to include the format and content of the codes placed on the tags, the 
protocols and frequencies that will be used by the tags and readers to transmit the 
data, the security and tamper-resistance of tags on packaging and freight contain-
ers, and applications use. 
The ISO and the EPCglobal have both been leading figures in this debate. The 
ISO has their 18000 standard and the EPCglobal Center has introduced the EPC 
standard. Wal-Mart has decided to use the EPC standard, where the DoD wants 
to use the EPC for general purposes, but use the ISO standard for air interface. 
This means a lot of pressure on the ISO and EPCglobal to come to some kind of 
an agreement.
What is EPC? The Auto-ID Center has proposed a new electronic product code 
(EPC) as the next standard for identifying products. The goal is not to replace ex-
isting bar code standards, but rather to create a migration path for companies to 
move from established standards for bar codes to the new EPC. To encourage this 
evolution, we have adopted the basic structures of the Global Trade Item Number 
(GTIN), an umbrella group under which all existing bar codes fall. There is no 
guarantee that the world will adopt the EPC, but the proposal already has the sup-
port of the Uniform Code Council and EAN International, which are the two main 
bodies that oversee international bar code standards. Other national and interna-
tional trade groups and standards bodies are working together.
The ISO is based in Geneva, and its standards carry the weight of law in some 
countries. All ISO standards are required to be universal around the world, so 
users of ISO RFID standards will not have to worry if their systems comply with 
the different regulations on frequencies and power output for each country where 
they do business. The ISO is very active in developing RFID standards for supply 
chain operations and is nearing completion on multiple standards to identify items 
and different types of logistics containers. As appropriate, EPCglobal submits its 
standards to ISO for review and ratification as ISO considers EPC as being a subset 
of its standards. 
Some in the industry anticipate a future where everyday objects and appli-
ances are connected to the Internet, and each other, via RFID tags. This so-called 
Internet of things will enable people to interact more with their environment, and 
their belongings with each other. EPCglobal, the not-for-profit standards organiza-
tion, is driving the development of a universal electronic product code system and 
a global information network to enable automatic identification of items in the 
supply chain. 
EPC standard is mainly backed by the U.S. vendors while ISO standard more 
widely supported and accepted in Europe. Japan has UID (ubiquitous ID), while 
China has announced its intent to create its own RFID standards. Even though 
EPC has the strongest commercial support, the true global standards are still under 
development and will be subjected to geopolitical forces.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
Appropriate standards allowing numerous companies to create interoperable 
products are a key prerequisite to widespread use of RFID tags. ISO/IEC 15693 
forms part of a series of international standards that specify a contactless smart 
card. It is titled “Identification Cards-Contactless Integrated Circuit(s) Cards—
Vicinity Cards”2 and has three parts: Part 1 (physical characteristics), Part 2 (air 
interface and initialization), and Part 3 (anticollision and transmission protocol). 
It specifies a 13.56-MHz RFID protocol, originally proposed by Texas Instruments 
and Philips Semiconductors in 1998, defining data exchange between RF tags and 
readers, and collision mediation when multiple tags are in a reader’s RF field. Com-
pliance guarantees that RF tags and readers using the ISO/IEC 15693 protocol will 
be compatible across companies and geographies. 
4.4  RFID Systems and Frequencies
4.4.1  Power Emissions Conversion
Before discussing the details of the regulations, note that there are several accepted 
means of describing one of the most important regulated parameters of an RF de-
vice: its radiated emissions. All license-exempt devices have some limitation on the 
amount of output power, or radiated energy, that they can produce. What differs 
among the various regulatory agencies is the means of describing this limit. Radi-
ated energy can be described in terms of: 
•• Electrical field strength (E) measured at some distance from the radiator;
•• Effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP);
•• Effective radiated power (ERP).
The electrical field strength (E) is perhaps the most precise way of describing 
the actual RF energy present at a point in space that a receiving antenna could 
use. Since the RF energy decreases with increasing distance from the transmitting 
antenna, the regulatory limits based on electrical field strength are specified at a 
specific distance from the transmitting antenna. While the electrical field strength 
may be precise, it is often not as useful from a design perspective as the effective 
isotropic radiated power (EIRP). 
The EIRP is the power that would have to be supplied to an ideal antenna that 
radiates uniformly in all directions in order to get the same electrical field strength 
that the device under test produces at the same distance; such an antenna is called 
an isotropic radiator. Given a distance r from the transmitting antenna, the EIRP 
can be calculated from E using the following formula:

Vicinity cards are cards that can be read from a greater distance as compared to proximity cards. ISO/IEC 
15693 systems operate at the 13.56-MHz frequency and offer a maximum read distance of 1–1.5m. As the 
vicinity cards have to operate at a greater distance, the necessary magnetic field is less (0.15 to 5 A/m) than 
that for a proximity card (1.5 to 7.5 A/m).

4.4  RFID Systems and Frequencies 
107
where the EIRP is expressed in dBm, E is the electrical field strength in V/m, r is 
distance in meters, and 0.377 is expressed in V2 (unit of measurement.) Contrary to 
the European regulations, the U.S. regulations are in most cases specified in terms 
of field strength, not power. The field strength shall be measured at 3m from the 
device under test.
The effective radiated power (ERP) is similar to the EIRP. It is the power that 
would have to be supplied to a half-wave dipole to get the same electrical field 
strength that the device under test produces at the same distance. A half-wave di-
pole represents more realistic antenna than an isotropic radiator. Since a half-wave 
dipole radiates more energy in some directions and less in others, it is said to have 
antenna gain in the direction of the most energy. 
The amount of antenna gain is usually expressed in decibels relative to an iso-
tropic radiator, or dBi. The maximum gain of a half-wave dipole is 2.15 dBi. Thus, 
in the direction of maximum gain, the amount of power required to produce the 
same electric field is less with a half-wave dipole than it is with an isotropic radia-
tor (Table 4.1). If both the ERP and the EIRP are expressed using a logarithmic 
scale, such as dBm, it holds that:

If one of the three parameters (EIRP, ERP, or E) at a distance r is given, the 
other two can be calculated. These reference parameters are used to define the 
permitted radiated power in RF systems, and they are often quoted in RFID reader 
and tag specifications. 
In the United States, engineers tend to use EIRP while in Europe engineers more 
commonly use ERP. 
4.4.2  North American and International Frequency Bands
The RF spectrum is a scarce and shared resource, used nationally and internation-
ally, and subject to a wide range of regulatory oversight. In the United States, the 
FCC is a key regulatory body that allocates spectrum use and resolves spectrum 
conflicts. The ITU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, which plays the 
same role internationally.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
Development of RFID systems suitable for international deployment faces 
some considerable problems as a result of disparate frequency regulations and the 
transmitting power of the reader. It is not only that the frequency bands have been 
allocated differently in different countries, but the permitted transmitting power 
for the reader also varies, which means that identical models can differ consider-
ably in their range. 
The frequency ranges of 125 kHz and 13.56 MHz are generally regarded as 
having been largely standardized. The standardization process for the remaining 
frequency ranges is being carried out on the basis of the ISO/IEC 18000 standards.
Both the U.S. and EU regulatory agencies place limitations on the operating 
frequencies, output power, spurious emissions, modulation methods, and transmit 
duty cycles, among other things. RFID tags and readers fall under the category 
of SRDs, in which, although they do not normally require a license, the products 
themselves are governed by the laws and regulations which vary from country to 
country. Today, the only globally accepted frequency band is the HF 13.56 MHz. 
For passive UHF RFID the problem is much more complicated, as frequencies 
allocated in some countries are not allowed in others, due to their proximity to 
already allocated bands for devices such as mobile phones and alarms. This dis-
continuity has resulted in the ITU dividing the world into three regulatory regions 
(Figure 4.1):
•• Region 1: Europe, Middle East, Africa, and the former Soviet Union, includ-
ing Siberia;
•• Region 2: North and South America and Pacific Rim east of the International 
Date Line;
•• Region 3: Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Rim west of the International Date 
Line.
Figure 4.1  ITU regions.

The main regulatory bodies in different regions are:
•• In the United States, the FCC;
•• In Europe, the CEPT;
•• In Japan, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Tele-
communication (MPHPT).
4.4.3  RFID Interoperability and Harmonization
When considering interoperability for global use of RFID devices, it is first neces-
sary to consider spectrum allocation. Perhaps the most essential aspect in world-
wide acceptance of RFID is to have spectrum available in all relevant markets so 
that RFID can be used where needed [1]. RFID systems in the United States, as with 
other ubiquitous RF devices used by the general public, are license-exempt. 
In the United States, RF radiation from intentional and unintentional license-
exempt radiators is regulated by the FCC under Part 15 of Title 47 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations. These regulations delineate the technical specifications, such 
as allowable frequency, power limits, and other operational constraints, under 
which an intentional radiator may be operated without an individual license. Part 
15 also allows operation of RFID systems over a broad range of frequencies, but 
places limits on the allowable output power of the system. 
Every available operating frequency has a specific power limit associated with 
it. The combination of frequency and allowable power level are the factors that dic-
tate the functional range of the particular RFID application, whether over a range 
of centimeters or hundreds of meters. These allowable power levels are particularly 
relevant for the power output of the readers, which have a far higher power output 
than the tags. 
Country-specific regulatory controls specify the field strengths and power lev-
els allowable for devices and systems operating at the different carrier frequencies. 
These levels naturally have a determining influence upon the ranges that are achiev-
able for the reactively coupled and propagation coupled systems. It is therefore 
important to establish and confirm what is allowable within the country in which 
the technology is to be used. 
In addition to power limits, there are restrictions on the use of certain bands by 
license-exempt devices to prevent potentially harmful interference to systems used 
for services such as safety, search and rescue, aeronautical communications, and 
scientific research. It should also be noted that license-exempt systems operating 
in United States under Part 15 must accept any interference from other systems in 
these bands, including interference from other license-exempt devices.
Many countries do not have rules for license-exempt systems like the United 
States. Instead, they allocate spectrum on a primary or secondary basis and require 
that all radio transmitters be licensed by the government. In addition, some coun-
tries that allow RFID currently do not recognize active tags within their regula-
tions. Similar to the United States, several other countries do not allocate spectrum 
specifically for RFID but to categories of service such as SRDs. 

110 
�������������������������������������
RFID Standards Development Challenges
In 2006, the ITU-R released a recommendation SM.1538-23 outlining the 
spectrum requirements and regulatory approaches applicable to SRD in Europe, 
the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea. Table 4.2 contains a partial 
list of countries currently using RFID and the frequency bands allowed for RFID 
operations.
Each frequency has advantages and disadvantages relative to its capabilities. 
Generally, a lower frequency means a lower read range and a slower data read rate 
but increased capabilities for reading near or on metal or liquid surfaces.
There are exceptions in terms of allowable frequency and functional use of the 
bandwidth for critical operations both in the United States and in other countries. 
For example, the allowable bandwidth and power for RFID devices are not gener-
ally the same from ITU region to region. In ITU Region 1, which covers most of 
Europe, the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band (13.553–13.567 
MHz) is much narrower than the bandwidth that is allowed in the United States 
for RFID. 
Also, use of the band at 433 MHz for active RFID in the United States is in-
tended for container tracking and is allowed at higher power levels than generally 
permissible for license-exempt devices in this band. However, operations of such 
systems are limited primarily to industrial locations, such as railheads and ship-
yards, and the systems must be registered with the FCC. 
3.	
ITU-R is presently exploring whether the traditional approach to spectrum management, allocating differ-
ent bands to different services, needs reconsideration, in light of the fact that hybrid services are becoming 
common and one channel can now carry a many different services (thanks to TCP/IP and packetization), 
while frequency-agile equipment allows for dynamic/flexible band sharing. This work may also include 
revising Recommendation ITU-R SM.1538-2: “Technical and operating parameters and spectrum require-
ments for short range radiocommunication devices,” which is now withdrawn.

111
In Europe, however, the 433.05–434.79-MHz band is an ISM band and is al-
located on a primary basis to SRDs such as RFID. In addition, many nations in 
East Asia (e.g., China, Japan, and South Korea) are currently developing their own 
regulations for RFID; for example, Japan is in the process of revising its regulations 
to allow the 950–956-MHz band to be used for license-exempt, low-power, pas-
sive tag RFID systems. They are also establishing a license structure for high-power 
(power levels up to any level not hazardous to humans at specified distances) pas-
sive RFID systems that will be used in industrial areas.
In general, RFID chips can be used to track products grouped in various 
hierarchies: 
•• Individual items or single packages containing multiple items for consumer 
purchase;
•• Cartons or cases of multiple items;
•• Pallets of multiple cartons or cases;
•• Loads (e.g., truckloads, shiploads, or railcar loads) of multiple pallets.
The products at each of these levels may be assigned an RFID label that is as-
sociated with information pertaining to at least one adjacent hierarchical level. For 
example, an RFID label on a pallet may be associated in a database with the RFID 
labels for each carton on the pallet, or may be associated with data pertaining to 
the RFID label from the truckload. 
Figure 4.2 illustrates needs for different requirements for different types (lay-
ers) of RFID tagging. The RF power, the frequency used, and therefore the reader-
tag distance will be different for different applications.
Although some of the ISM frequency bands are internationally recognized 
(e.g., 13.56 MHz and 2.45 GHz), others are not. In the United States, 915 MHz 
is recognized as an ISM band, while 433 MHz is not; however, in Europe the 915 
MHz is not recognized, but 433 MHz is. Differences like this add to the challenges 
of harmonization of RFID bands. 
Figure 4.2  Different layers of RFID tagging.

�������������������������������������
RFID Standards Development Challenges
In recognition of the complications associated with international harmoniza-
tion of frequency bands, the DoD requires that passive RFID systems be both multi-
mode and multiband to meet global requirements. Accordingly, the DoD has issued 
a set of policies mandating system performance and functionality for implementing 
RFID systems within the DoD supply chain. Additionally, it specifies operation 
in the 860–960-MHz frequency range and requires that passive RFID systems be 
capable of operating in this frequency range. 
4.4.4  Advantages and Disadvantages of Using 125-kHz Frequency
The 125/134.2-kHz low-frequency RFID tags are known as being robust, durable 
replacements for bar code or other fragile identification technologies. The 125 kHz 
is used in many industrial applications since it is the most “metal friendly” of all 
RF frequencies. 
Some examples of industrial applications are process controls (manufactur-
ing floor), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), authentication/verification (printers, 
UV bulbs, fluids, paints), vehicle identification, personnel ID, and specialized mar-
kets (oil and gas pipe, pharmaceutical), and so on. Advantages and disadvantages 
of this band are summarized next.
The advantages of the 125-kHz RFID are:
•• Works well in metal surroundings;
•• Works well around the objects with the high water content;
•• Anticollision (ability to read more than on tag at a time) rarely necessary;
•• Low sensitivity to interference;
•• Simple and inexpensive but sufficient for such applications as animal ID and 
car immobilizers.
The disadvantages of the 125-kHz RFID are:
•• Short read range: up to 5 feet, although in most cases only few inches;
•• Low read rate;
•• Limited EEPROM memory size;
•• Tags are usually read-only tags (simple tags with hardwired code), although 
read/write tag also exist;
•• Passive (inductive) tags are most common in this frequency band.
4.4.5  Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the 13.56-MHz Frequency
Much of the current activities today revolve around an RFID frequency of 13.56 
MHz. The reason for this attention is that there are several RFID technology pro-
viders who have designed their product offerings based on this particular frequency; 
13.56 MHz is, after all, an ISO standard for smart card applications.
Smart cards differ from RFID tags in that they are used for more than data 
storage. In some smart card applications, the card itself contains a microprocessor 
that can define parameters for data storage and byte allocation. 

4.4  RFID Systems and Frequencies 
113
Smart card applications require that certain RFID attributes be present for 
implementations of that technology to be successful. Since 13.56 MHz provides 
for RFID near-field read/write capability, it is ideally suited to smart card applica-
tions in which secure financial transactions are being transmitted. Understandably, 
a smart card user would not want his or her bank account number to be able to be 
read at a distance of 3–5m. Why are these attributes important? If a technology, 
or specific frequency in this case, was targeted for a particular application (smart 
cards), then it may not have the necessary attributes that would be needed for an-
other RFID application, such as item management. 
The 13.56-MHz inductive passive RFID systems are one of the mainstreams 
RFID products, and some of the main advantages (and disadvantages) of this band 
are listed as follows. 
The advantages of the 13.56-MHz RFID are:
•• Frequency band available worldwide as an ISM frequency;
•• Well suited for applications requiring reading small amounts of data and 
minimal distances;
•• Popular smart card frequency;
•• ISO 15693, ISO 14443, and HF EPC standardization for the air interface;
•• Robust reader-to-tag communication;
•• Excellent immunity to environmental noise and electrical interference;
•• Well-defined and localized label interrogation zones;
•• Minimal shielding effects from adjacent objects and the human body;
•• Penetrates water/tissue well; 
•• Freedom from environmental reflections that can affect UHF and microwave 
systems;
•• Good data transfer rate;
•• High clock frequency and synchronous subcarrier;
•• On-chip capacitors for tuning transponder coil can be easily realized;
•• Uses normal CMOS processing, cheap ICs, and disposable tags;
•• Cost-effective antenna coil manufacturing;
•• Low RF power transmission so EM regulation compliance does not cause 
problems;
•• No user licenses for reader systems required (license-exempt ISM band);
•• Possible to use the systems in industrial and in hazardous environments with 
potential for explosive substances.
The disadvantages of the 13.56-MHz RFID are:
•• Government-regulated frequency (United States and Europe recently 
harmonized);
•• Does not penetrate or transmit around metals; 
•• Large antennas (compared to higher frequencies);

114 
�������������������������������������

•• Larger tag size than those on higher frequencies;
•• Tag construction requires more than one surface to complete a circuit;
•• Reading range of less than 1.0m (3 feet).
4.4.6  Operation in the 433-MHz Band
The 433-MHz band has rarely been used for RFID applications in the past, but 
it seems that is starting to draw more attention lately. Major applications using 
this frequency are cargo handling, container locations, Real-Time Location Systems 
(RTLS), and asset tracking.
This band is only allocated as an ISM band in ITU Region 1 (including Eu-
rope). The 433-MHz RFID systems are subject to certification under ETSI EN 300 
220. ISO 18000-7 is the standard for the air interface for the 433-MHz RFID and 
ISO 24730-3 is the related 433-MHz RTLS standard.
The 433-MHz systems use active tags because of the low power allowance of 
10 mW. Selecting an optimal RF for operation of an active RFID system requires 
consideration of several factors, including technical performance, regulatory issues, 
and coexistence with other technologies. The 433 MHz has been selected as the op-
timal frequency for global use of active RFID from a broad range of radio frequen-
cies against these parameters and also a frequency used for ISM appliances [2]. 
Two key technical performance parameters of an active RFID system are di-
rectly related to the frequency of operation: maximum communication range and 
propagation within crowded environments. Frequencies between 100 MHz and 1 
GHz offer the best technical performance in terms of range for active RFID. The use 
of active tags provides ranges of hundreds of meters outdoors, making this technol-
ogy useful in the very large outdoor facilities used for storage and trans-shipment.
Implementation of active RFID in this band for some years has also shown that 
433-MHz active RFID can be used without interfering with other systems in the 
same band.
The advantages of the 433-MHz RFID are:
•• Works well in RF-impaired environments;
•• Affordable components plus deployment;
•• No special environmental configuration;
•• Multiple tag designs to match asset groups and application;
•• Supports a high density of tags;
•• 10–15-foot accuracy suitable for most applications;
•• Instant detection provides perimeter control capability.
The disadvantages of the 433-MHz RFID are:
•• High price if used as active tags;
•• Increased size and weight;
•• A need for maintenance (changing batteries, for example).

4.4.7  Operation in the 900-MHz Band
Traditionally, passive transponders operate at 125 kHz or 13.56 MHz using coils 
as antennas. These transponders operate in the magnetic near field of the base sta-
tion’s coil antenna, and their reading distance is typically limited to less than 1.0m 
(3 feet). A problem of these systems is the low efficiency of reasonably large anten-
nas at such low frequencies. 
Due to great demand for higher data rates, longer reading distances, and small 
antenna sizes, there is a strong interest in UHF frequency band RFID transponders, 
especially for the 868–915-MHz bands. The frequency band of 902–928 MHz 
is one of the ISM bands in the United States (FCC, Part 15.247 regulations) and 
Canada, commonly abbreviated as the 915-MHz ISM band. In this band, there are 
no restrictions to the application or the duty cycle as there were intended for the 
control and periodic applications only. Furthermore, the allowed power output is 
considerably higher. 
Because of the lack of restrictions and higher allowed power, the 915-MHz 
ISM band is very popular for license-exempt short range applications including au-
dio and video transmission. FCC section 15.249 allows 50 mV/m of electrical field 
strength at 3-m distance in the frequency band of 902–928 MHz. This corresponds 
to an EIRP of –1.23 dBm. The harmonics limit is one hundredth of the fundamen-
tal level, 500 µV/m, corresponding to an EIRP of –41.23 dBm [3]. 
The frequency of operation for the reader-to-tag communication in passive 
UHF RFID is not fixed. The reader does a frequency hopping in the ISM band in 
UHF for communicating with the tags. The frequency hopping avoids interference 
that might occur due to other devices using some part of the ISM band’s spectrum. 
Also, the modulation schemes used in the reader-to-tag communication depend on 
the type of the protocol being read.
The U.S. readers will have a maximum output power of +30 dBm (1W), the Eu-
ropean readers will have a maximum output power of +27 dBm, and the Japanese 
readers will have a maximum output power of +30 dBm. 
A new requirement for a dense reader mode is being introduced in the United 
States that will be used when there are a high number of readers in close proximity. 
Most 1-W readers to date in the United States are designed for low-density usage, 
and their emissions and out-of-band requirements are defined by the FCC. For the 
U.S. and Japanese readers, a saturated power amplifier can be used, which allows 
for higher power amplifier efficiency (PAE) on the order of 50%. Regulations re-
quire the European and dense reader mode readers to operate the power amplifier 
in the linear range, which reduces PAE to approximately 30%.
Even higher output power can be used if the system employs some form of 
spread spectrum such as frequency hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum. 
The reason such allowances are made is that spread-spectrum systems are less like-
ly to interfere with other systems than are single-frequency transmitter, and they 
are often more immune to interference from other systems.
For more up-to-date details on UHF regulations in Europe, see publication 
ERC REC 70-73 [4].
The advantages of the 915-MHz RFID are:

116 
�������������������������������������
RFID Standards Development Challenges
•• License-exempt ISM band in United States;
•• Read range of up to 20 feet (6m);
•• Significantly higher data rates than LF RFID;
•• Widespread use;
•• Can cover dock door portals up to 9 feet wide; therefore, suitable for inven-
tory tracking applications including pallets and cases.
The disadvantages of the 915-MHz RFID are:
•• Absorbed by liquids, although Gen2 tags and antenna designs are less 
susceptible;
•• Unpredictable performance near metal, although Gen2 tags and antenna de-
signs less susceptible;
•• Interferes with existing bands in some countries, but receiving certification;
•• Common sources of interference include 900-MHz cordless phones, older 
900-MHz wireless LANs, metal supports, equipment, and cabinets;
•• As a consequence of sometimes unpredictable radio propagation due to re-
flections, some tags may be successfully read from large distance away from 
the reader, while neighboring tags may receive little power from the reader.
Efficient antennas are most readily constructed with dimensions on the order 
of a half of the wavelength, in this case around 6 inches (150 mm), an inconve-
niently large size for many desirable applications. 
It is possible to compress the linear dimension by bending the conductive re-
gions, or using large-area structures, though inevitably with some compromise in 
radiation resistance and thus performance. At these frequencies tags are also sensi-
tive to environmental effects, and optimal designs may change depending on the 
material to which the tag is to be attached.
4.4.8  Operation in the 2.45- and 5.8-GHz Bands
The basic operating principle of microwave 2.45-GHz RFID systems is energy and 
data transmission using propagating radio signals (E-field transmission). This is 
exactly the same principle as used in long-range radio communication systems. 
An antenna of the reader generates a propagating radio wave, which is received 
by the antenna in the tag. A passive power tag converts the signal to DC voltage to 
supply the tag with energy. Data transmission from the reader to the tag is done by 
changing one parameter of the transmitting field (amplitude, frequency, or phase). 
The return transmission from the tag is accomplished by changing the load of the 
tag’s antenna (amplitude and/or phase). 
In this context, the microwave, 13.56-MHz and 125-kHz systems use the same 
principle. For microwave RFID systems, this method is called modulated backscat-
ter. Alternatively, a signal of different frequency can be generated, modulated, and 
transmitted to the reader. The latter types of systems are referred to as active RF 

4.4  RFID Systems and Frequencies

transmitter tags. The 2.4–2.4835-GHz band is another ISM band covered by FCC 
sections 15.247 and 15.249. 
The advantages of the 2.4-GHz RFID are:
•• The 2.4-GHz band is a worldwide license-exempt band, and this is an impor-
tant advantage compared to, for example, the 902–928-MHz band;
•• The 2.4-GHz band also has a wider bandwidth than the 902–928-MHz 
band, which means more available channels;
•• Good reflections off metal surfaces allow better propagation in cluttered 
environments;
•• It has reasonable propagation through nonconductive materials, such as 
wood and wood-based products, natural and synthetic garments, and plastics;
•• Because tags operating in the E-field do not require antennas with extremely 
low impedances, inexpensive flexible antennas able to withstand consider-
able bending are achievable.
The disadvantages of the 2.4-GHz RFID are:
•• The active components are more expensive and have higher current power 
consumption; 
•• It has reduced propagation distance for the same power;
•• Moisture and moisture-containing substances can exhibit energy absorbing 
mechanisms at microwave frequencies;
•• For ranges in excess of 1.0m (3 feet), multipath effects and fading need to be 
considered;
•• It shares spectrum allocation with spread-spectrum radios, microwave ovens, 
Bluetooth, WLANS, TV devices, and so forth;
•• It is more susceptible to electronic noise than lower UHF bands, for example, 
433-MHz and 860–930-MHz bands;
•• Regulatory approvals are still in process.
For single-frequency or other systems that do not qualify as spread-spectrum, 
the same transmit power limits as in the 902–928-MHz band apply. The only dif-
ference is that an averaging detector can be used in the 2.4-GHz band, allowing a 
higher peak output power, with the limitation that the peak electrical field strength 
must not be more than 20 dB above the average value. Thus, similar to the control 
and periodic applications described earlier, the transmitting strength can be up 
to 20 dB larger than the limits for continuous signals if the duty cycle is reduced 
accordingly.
As with the 902–928-MHz band, larger transmitting power levels are allowed 
if the spread spectrum is used. The criteria for a frequency-hopping system in the 
2.4-GHz ISM band are:

118 
�������������������������������������
RFID Standards Development Challenges
•• The transmitter hops pseudo-randomly between at least 15 nonoverlapping 
frequency channels.
•• The average time of occupancy at any frequency must not be larger than 
0.4 second within a time period of 0.4 second multiplied by the number of 
channels.
The permitted peak transmit power measured at the antenna input of a frequen-
cy-hopping system with at least 75 hopping frequencies is +30 dBm. For systems 
with less than 75 but at least 15 hopping frequencies, a peak transmitting power 
of +21 dBm is allowed. Similar to the 902–928-MHz band, the power has to be 
reduced if the isotropic antenna gain is larger than 6 dBi. This allows a maximum 
EIRP of +36 dBm in a system with at least 75 channels or +27 dBm in a system with 
less than 75 but at least 15 channels.
Systems operating at microwave frequencies may be considered to exhibit qua-
si-optical features with the facility to form well-defined beams. By exploiting these 
spatial directivity features, systems can be configured for interrogating defined ar-
eas. However, costs for transponders in the category are generally higher, by a fac-
tor of 2 or more, than lower-frequency devices. 
The antenna structures often used for microwave tags yield a directional beam, 
in contrast with the near-spherical field patterns associated with lower-frequency 
antenna structures. Each antenna structure will exhibit a primary forward lobe 
and, depending upon antenna dimensions in relation to the wavelength, a number 
of side lobes. Because of these features, the direction in which the antennas are de-
ployed (directivity) in relation to a readable tag will influence the range and ability 
to detect the tag.
Today 2.45-GHz tags are available in many different shapes and with differ-
ent functionality, influenced by applications and its requirements. Unlike inductive 
RFID tags, which require substantial surface area, many turns of wire, or magnetic 
core material to collect the magnetic field, UHF and microwave tags can be very 
small, requiring length in only one dimension. Thus, in addition to a longer range 
over the inductive systems, the UHF and microwave tags are easier to package 
and come in a wider variety of configurations. Tag lengths of 20 to 100 mm (1–4 
inches) are typical. The tag’s thickness is limited only by the thickness of the chip 
as the antenna can be fabricated on thin, flexible materials. 
The 5.8-GHz band offers the advantages of the less congested band, result-
ing in less interference (the longest range is up to 1,000m), but it has a number of 
disadvantages; for example, it is not available in the United States or many other 
countries, orientation of the antennas is very important, and chips are difficult 
and expensive to build. Microwave RFID has been effectively used in special ap-
plications where the directionality, range (particularly with active tags), and very 
fast data transfer features are required. These areas include asset tracking, factory 
automation (particularly in automotive manufacturing), toll systems, and barrier-
based access control. 
In the United States, the FCC has been requested to provide a spectrum alloca-
tion of 75 MHz in the 5.85–5.925-GHz band for intelligent transportation services 
(ITS).

4.5  ISO/IEC 18000: RFID Air Interface Standards
4.5.1  About the 18000 Standards
ISO/IEC 18000 is a series of standards being created by ISO/IEC/JTC creating RFID 
air interface standards for the item management. ISO/IEC 18000 has been devel-
oped in order to:
•• Provide a framework to define common communications protocols for in-
ternationally usable frequencies for RFID and, where possible, to determine 
the use of the same protocols for all frequencies such that the problems of 
migrating from one to another are diminished; 
•• Minimize software and implementation costs; 
•• Enable system management and control and information exchange to be 
common as far as is possible.
The standard contains the following parts:
•• 18000-1 Part 1; Reference architecture and definition of parameters to be 
standardized;
•• 18000-2 Part 2; Parameters for air interface communications below 135 kHz;
•• 18000-3 Part 3; Parameters for air interface communications at 13.56 MHz;
•• 18000-4 Part 4; Parameters for air interface communications at 2.45 GHz;
•• 18000-5 Part 5; Parameters for air interface communications at 5.8 GHz 
(withdrawn due to the lack of global interest);
•• 18000-6 Part 6; Parameters for air interface communications at 860 to 960 
MHz;
•• 18000-7 Part 7; Parameters for air interface communications at 433 MHz.
As can be seen, each of these parts deals with a different aspect of RFID. The 
first part is the defining document that explains how the standard works, and the 
rest are divided by frequency. All of the parts of ISO/IEC 18000 have been pub-
lished, but work items are currently open to revise parts 6 and 7.
4.5.2  ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 
ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 defines the generic architecture concepts in which item 
identification may commonly be required within the logistics and supply chain and 
defines the parameters that need to be determined in any standardized air interface 
definition in the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 18000. 
The subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 18000 provide the specific values for defini-
tion of the air interface parameters for a particular frequency or type of air inter-
face, from which compliance (or noncompliance) with ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 can 
be established. In addition, it provides description of example conceptual architec-
tures in which these air interfaces are often to be utilized. ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 
is an enabling standard that supports and promotes several RFID implementations 

120

without making conclusions about the relative technical merits of any available 
option for any possible application.
4.5.3  ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 
ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the air interface for RFID devices operating below 
135 kHz. The purpose of ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 is to provide a common technical 
specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing RFID 
application standards. 
ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 is intended to allow for compatibility and to encour-
age interoperability of products in the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-
2:2009 defines the physical layer used for communication between the interroga-
tor and the tag and further defines the communications protocol used in the air 
interface.
Two types of tag are defined by ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009: Type A and Type B, 
which differ only by their physical layer. Both support the same inventory (anticol-
lision) and protocol. Type A tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, 
including during the tag-to-interrogator transmission, and operate at 125 kHz. 
Type B tags are powered by the interrogator, except during the tag-to-interrogator 
transmission, and operate at 125 kHz or 134.2 kHz.
4.5.4  ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010 
It is an international standard for passive RFID item-level identification and pro-
vides physical layer, collision management system, and protocol values for RFID 
systems for item identification operating at 13.56 MHz in accordance with the 
requirements of ISO/IEC 18000-1. 
ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010 has three modes of operation, intended to address dif-
ferent applications. The modes, although not interoperable, are noninterfering.
4.5.5  ISO/IEC 18000-4:2008 
It defines the 2.45-GHz protocols that support ISO/IEC 18000-1. Each of the spe-
cific physical/data link configurations is defined in a separate subclause. The con-
figuration descriptions include a physical layer and a data link layer.
ISO/IEC 18000-4:2008 defines the air interface for RFID devices operating in 
the 2.45-GHz ISM band used in item management applications. ISO/IEC 18000-
4:2008 provides a common technical specification for RFID devices that can be 
used by ISO committees developing RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-
4:2008 is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage interoperability of 
products for the growing RFID market in the international marketplace. 
ISO/IEC 18000-4:2008 defines the forward and return link parameters for 
technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating 
channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum EIRP, spurious emis-
sions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit trans-
mission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, 
hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. ISO/IEC 18000-4:2008 further 
defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.

4.5  ISO/IEC 18000: RFID Air Interface Standards 
121
ISO/IEC 18000-4:2008 contains two modes. The first is a passive tag operating 
as an interrogator talks first, while the second is a battery-assisted tag operating as 
a tag talks first.
4.5.6  ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 
It defines the air interface for RFID devices operating in the 860–960-MHz ISM 
band used in item management applications. It provides a common technical speci-
fication for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing RFID ap-
plication standards. ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 is intended to allow for compatibility 
and to encourage interoperability of products for the growing RFID market in the 
international marketplace. 
The standard defines the forward and return link parameters for technical at-
tributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel ac-
curacy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum EIRP, spurious emissions, modu-
lation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order, 
and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence, 
spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines the communications protocol 
used in the air interface.
ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 specifies the physical and logical requirements for a 
passive-backscatter, interrogator-talks-first (ITF) or tag-only-talks-after-listening 
(TOTAL) RFID system. The system comprises interrogators and tags, also known 
as labels. An interrogator receives information from a tag by transmitting a contin-
uous-wave (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag responds by modulating the reflec-
tion coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering an information signal to the 
interrogator. The system is ITF, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection 
coefficient with an information signal only after being directed to do so by an inter-
rogator, or TOTAL, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient 
with an information signal upon entering an interrogator’s field after first listening 
for interrogator modulation in order to determine if the system is ITF or not.
ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 contains one mode with four types. Types A, B, and 
C are ITF. Type A uses pulse-interval encoding (PIE) in the forward link and an 
adaptive ALOHA collision-arbitration algorithm. Type B uses Manchester coding 
in the forward link and an adaptive binary-tree collision-arbitration algorithm. 
Type C uses PIE in the forward link and a random slotted collision-arbitration 
algorithm. Type D is TOTAL based on Pulse Position Encoding or Miller M=2 
encoded subcarrier. 
ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 specifies:
•• Physical interactions (the signaling layer of the communication link) between 
interrogators and tags;
•• Interrogator and tag operating procedures and commands;
•• The collision arbitration scheme used to identify a specific tag in a multiple-
tag environment.
This standard was revised and published in 2010 with the addition of a Type 
D and support for sensors and battery assist. The addition of these options to the 

122 
�������������������������������������
RFID Standards Development Challenges
standard meant that the document had grown to almost 500 pages. A new work 
item to break this standard into smaller parts was approved at the end of 2010, and 
the committee met, for the first time since that approval, to review the work that 
has been done. The standard has been broken into five parts:
•• Part 6: Parameters for air interface communications at 860 MHz to 960 
MHz General;
•• Part 61: Parameters for air interface communications at 860 MHz to 960 
MHz Type A;
•• Part 62: Parameters for air interface communications at 860 MHz to 960 
MHz Type B;
•• Part 63: Parameters for air interface communications at 860 MHz to 960 
MHz Type C;
•• Part 64: Parameters for air interface communications at 860 MHz to 960 
MHz Type D.
4.5.7  ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 
It defines the air interface for RFID devices operating as an active RF tag in the 
433-MHz band used in item management applications. It provides a common tech-
nical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO technical committees 
developing RFID application standards.
ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage 
interoperability of products for the growing RFID market in the international mar-
ketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the forward and return link parameters 
for technical attributes, including, but not limited to, operating frequency, oper-
ating channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power, spurious 
emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit trans-
mission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, 
hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 further 
defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.
ISO/IEC 18000-7, Parameters for active air interface communications at 433 
MHz, was last published in 2010. This standard has been opened to revise the 
technology to include multichannel utilization and more efficient communication 
techniques needed to address increased market and application needs for higher 
and more secure data transmissions. This revision will also specify the sensor inter-
face and a universal mechanism to allow for other services to be enabled on the tag.
4.6  UHF and EPCglobal Gen 2
The EPC is a universal identifier for any physical object. It is used in information 
systems that need to track or otherwise refer to physical objects. Large subsets of 
applications that use the EPC also rely upon RFID tags as a data carrier. 
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the EPC and RFID are not synony-
mous: EPC is an identifier, and RFID is a data carrier. RFID tags contain other data 

4.6  UHF and EPCglobal Gen 2 
123
besides EPC identifiers (and in some applications may not carry an EPC identifier 
at all), and the EPC identifier exists also in non-RFID contexts.
4.6.1  The EPC Class Structure
The RFID Class Structure, depicted in Table 4.3, provides a framework to classify 
tags according to their primary functional characteristics. The RFID Class Structure 
classifies tags as belonging to one of five classes: Class 1 (identity tags), Class 2 
(higher functionality tags), Class 3 (semipassive tags), Class 4 (active ad hoc tags), 
or Class 5 (reader tags). 
Each successive class within this framework builds upon, that is, is a superset 
of, the functionality contained within, the previous class, resulting in a layered 
functional classification structure. Class 1 forms the foundation of this framework 
[5]:
•• Class 1 identity tags are designed to be the lowest-cost, minimum-usable-
functionality tag classification. Identity tags are pure passive RFID tags 
that are expected to implement a resource discovery mechanism and store a 
unique object identifier only. The signaling and modulation defined for Class 
1 tags are the foundation for all passive communication within this hierarchy. 
•• Class 2 higher functionality tags build upon the identity tag by providing 
more functionality, such as a tag identifier and read/write memory, while still 
maintaining a pure passive power and communication scheme. 
•• Class 3 semipassive tags add an on-tag power source, such as a battery, to 
their higher functionality foundation. Semipassive tags combine passive com-
munication with an on-tag power source that enables a tag to operate with-
out the presence of a passive tag reader (i.e., a Class 5 reader tag). 
•• Class 4 active ad hoc tags encompass the Class 3 semipassive tags and, in 
addition, are ad hoc networking devices that are capable of communicating 
with other Class 4 tags using active communication and with Class 5 reader 
tags using both passive and active communication. Because they may initiate 
communication, Class 4 tags are necessarily active. Functionally, these tags 
lie in the realm of ubiquitous computers or smart dust.
•• Class 5 reader tags encompass the functionality of a Class 4 active ad hoc tag 
and are able to power and communicate with pure passive Class 1 and Class 
2 tags and communicate with Class 3 tags via passive communication.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
The main technological difference between passive and semipassive (battery-
assisted) labels has to do with the source from which the tags receives the ap-
propriate amount of power in order for the IC to reach the excitation level (or to 
wake up) and send signals back to the reader. Passive tags gather energy from the 
reader’s signal, whereas semipassive tags contain an integrated power source and 
have no need to receive energy from the reader. This enables semipassive labels to 
outperform passive labels in reliability (up to 100% read and write rates), even for 
liquids, metals, and foils, and in increased ranges of up to 60 feet.
The EPC Tag Data Standard4 defines the EPC and also specifies the memory 
contents of Gen 2 RFID Tags. In more detail, the Tag Data Standard covers two 
broad areas:
•• The specification of the EPC, including its representation at various levels of 
the EPCglobal Architecture and its correspondence to GS1 keys and other 
existing codes.
•• The specification of data that is carried on Gen 2 RFID tags, including 
the EPC, user memory data, control information, and tag manufacturer 
information.
4.6.2  UHF Gen 2
Developed by the EPCglobal Industry Group, the EPC Gen 2 standard5 defines 
the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter, ITF RFID system 
operating in the 860–960-MHz frequency range. EPC Generation 2 is the latest 
standard for RFID tags, specifying the operation of the tag and the communication 
protocol for interoperability with EPC readers worldwide (see Table 4.4). 
EPC Gen 2 was developed by a collaboration of leading RFID users and ven-
dors, working through EPCglobal, a nonprofit trade group. EPCglobal is part of 
the UCC/EAN organization, which has long administered bar code and other stan-
dards around the world. The frequency used for UHF RFID systems varies be-
tween 860 and 960 MHz. UHF RFID systems operate at 915 MHz in the United 
States and 868 MHz in Europe, and they are being widely deployed due to RFID

the DoD. In addition to retail, UHF systems are employed in various supply chain 
management applications.
Gen 2 (as well as ISO 18000-6) is a technical standard that specifies the air 
interface protocol or, in other words, how tags and readers communicate. The 
leadership of EPCglobal, along with collaborative efforts throughout the industry, 
has now set the stage for real-world implementation of Gen 2 technologies that are 
compliant with the newest EPCglobal RFID specifications for the UHF band. 
While primarily intended for the supply chain market, the Gen 2 RFID systems 
may also be used in asset tracking, baggage tagging, manufacturing, and a wide as-
sortment of other applications where long read range is required. The Gen 2 chip is 
intended for use in the manufacture of passive RFID tag products operating in the 
860–960-MHz frequency band. Thus, Gen 2 addresses a very small, although very 
important, part of the total standards environment.
The Gen 2 protocol takes the best features of the Gen 1 Class 1, Gen 1 Class 
2, and ISO protocols to make a new and improved standard. The Gen 2 promises 
to be a global, open, interoperable standard that incorporates the frequency and 
performance requirements for worldwide use. 
Some of the features of Gen 2 are as follows:
•• High read rate of 1,500 tags/second in North America, and 600 tags/sec-
ond in Europe. This is especially important in countries where the narrow 
bandwidth limits the data rates to 30% of that can be achieved in the United 
States.
•• Proven air interface with forward link PIE ASK, backscatter link FM0 or 
Miller-modulated subcarrier.
•• Provides an operating mode in dense reader environments.
•• Better read algorithms (bit mask filtering) that eliminate duplicate reads, al-
low tags to enter reader field late and still be read, and allow tags to stay 
quiet until asked to talk, thus making it faster to find a specific tag.
•• Each tag has security enhanced with 32-bit password encryption and perma-
nent kill capability.
•• Write schemes enhance write speed function.
•• In addition to the required EPC data, there is optional memory to support 
user-specific data.
•• Meets global regulatory compliance standards.
4.6.3  Electronic Product Code Information Services
In September 2007, EPCglobal Inc. announced a new industry standard providing 
the capability for visibility into the movement, location and disposition of assets, 
goods and services throughout the world. EPC Information Services (EPCIS)6 al-
lows for the seamless, secure exchange of data at every point in the life cycle of 
goods and services.

At the time of this writing, the latest revision of this specification was Version 1.0.1, approved on TSC 
September 21, 2007.

RFID Standards Development Challenges
In October 2006, EPCglobal successfully completed interoperability testing of 
the platform along with 12 other large and small solution providers from Japan, 
Korea, and North America, including Auto-ID Labs, Avicon, BEA Systems, Bent 
Systems, IBM, Globe Ranger, IIJ, NEC, Oracle, Polaris Systems, Samsung, and 
T3Ci. The interoperability test marked a significant milestone in the development 
of EPCIS, which is the result of years of effort by more than 150 companies and 
organizations participating in the EPCIS working group. The positive results of 
this test and solution provider support have led to the ratification of this standard. 
EPCIS, by providing a standard set of interfaces for EPC data, enables a single 
way to capture and share information, while still allowing the flexibility for indus-
try and organization-specific implementations. The specification supports business 
cases and consumer benefits such as container tracking, product authentication, 
promotions management, baggage tracking, and electronic proof of delivery, chain 
of custody, returns management, and operations management. 
4.6.4  UHF RFID Tag Example
The EPC tag class structure is often misunderstood; class is not the same as genera-
tion. Class describes a tag’s basic functionality, for example, whether it has memory 
or a battery, whereas generation refers to a tag specification’s major release or ver-
sion number. The full name for what is popularly called EPC Generation 2 is actu-
ally EPC Class 1 Generation 2, indicating that the specification refers to the second 
major release of a specification for a tag with write-once memory. Figure 4.3 and 
the description of the UHF RFID tag were taken from [6].
Antenna performance at UHF and microwave frequencies is dependent on the 
substrate, that is, thickness and electromagnetic properties (conductivity, permittiv-
ity, and permeability). It also depends on the conductive quality of electrodes. Low-
cost constraints and diversity of RFID applications lead to consider and investigate 
nonstandard materials to be used for both tag and antenna. These investigations 
concern low-cost substrate material such as paper, plastic, and polymers (Figure 
4.4).
The use of conductive inks is an alternative to usual electrodes made with stan-
dard conductors such as copper and aluminum. The performance of an antenna 
made with conductive ink is limited by the conductivity and the thickness of the 
deposited ink. To avoid excess loss and get good directivity, the thickness of the 
ink must be larger than skin depth (which is dependent on the conductivity and the 
frequency) [7].
The tag antenna is generally omnidirectional in order to ensure the identifica-
tion in all directions. The structure of the tag antenna should also be as small as 
possible in size. Because of its simplicity and omnidirectionality, the λ/2 dipole is 
one of the most preferred forms. At UHF frequencies the typical size is 150 mm (6 
inches), which is big. Usually the dipole is folded in order to reduce its size. This 
usually needs full-wave electromagnetic simulation in order to take into account 
the capacitive and inductive coupling introduced by the folded form.
Some typical specification parameters are shown in Table 4.5.

Components of the RFID System
5.1  RFID Engineering Challenges 
An RFID system consists of an RFID reader, an RFID tag, and an information-man-
aging host computer. The reader contains an RF transceiver module (transmitter 
and receiver), a signal processor and controller unit, a coupling element (antenna), 
and a serial data interface (RS232, RS485) to a host system. 
The tag acts as a programmable data carrying device and consists of a coupling 
element (resonant tuned circuit) and a low-power CMOS IC. The IC chip contains 
an analog RF interface, antenna tuning capacitor, RF-to-dc rectifier system, digital 
control, Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), 
and data modulation circuits. 
RFID involves contactless reading and writing of data into an RFID tag’s non-
volatile memory through an RF signal. The reader emits an RF signal and data is 
exchanged when the tag comes in proximity to the reader signal. 
Tags can be categorized as: 
•• An active tag, which has a battery that supplies power to all functions;
•• A semipassive tag, which has a battery used only to power the tag IC, and 
not for communication;
•• A passive tag, which has no battery on it. The absence of a power supply 
makes passive tags much cheaper and more reliable than active tags. 
Given the increase in RFID usage, many new challenges face design engineers. 
Currently, these challenges include multiple tag standards, 20% tag failure rate, in-
stallation and placement issues, the need for cost-effective management and main-
tenance of readers, the need for reductions in reader size that allows them to be 
imbedded into structures and handheld devices, and intellectual property protec-
tion and secure access control protocols. 
A number of different parameters will influence a quality and reliability of the 
RFID system: tag size, reader/writer antenna size, tag orientation, tag operating 
time, tag movement velocity, effect of metallic substances and metal items on op-
erating range, multi-tag operating characteristics, and effect of number of tags on 
operating success rate, tag overlapping, and so forth.

Components of the RFID System
5.2  Near-Field and Far-Field Propagation
There are two main categories for RFID systems on the market today. These are 
near-field systems that employ inductive (magnetic) coupling of the transponder tag 
to the reactive energy circulating around the reader antenna, and far-field systems 
that couple to the real power contained in free-space propagating electromagnetic 
plane waves [1]. 
Near-field coupling techniques are generally applied to RFID systems operating 
in the LF and HF bands with relatively short reading distances, whereas far-field 
coupling is applicable to potentially long-range UHF and microwave RFID sys-
tems. Whether or not a tag is in the near or far field depends upon how close it is 
to the field creation system and the operating frequency or wavelength. 
There is a distance, commonly known as the radian sphere, inside which one 
is said to be in the near field and outside of which one is said to be in the far field. 
Because changes in electromagnetic fields occur gradually, the boundary is not ex-
actly defined; the primary magnetic field begins at the antenna and induces electric 
field lines in space (the near field). 
The zone where the electromagnetic field separates from the antenna and prop-
agates into free space as a plane wave is called the far field. In the far field, the ratio 
of electric field E to magnetic field H has the constant value of 120 or 377Ω. The 
approximate distance (5.1) where this transition zone happens is given as follows:

r
λ
π
=
	
(5.1)
It is also important to notice that this expression is valid for small antennas 
where D << l.
The reactive near-field region is a region where E- and H-fields are not or-
thogonal; anything within this region will couple with the antenna and distort the 
radiation pattern, so the antenna gain is not a meaningful parameter here. 
Using (5.1), at 13.56 MHz (λ = 22m), this places the near-field to far-field 
boundary at about 3.5m (10 feet). 
It has been estimated that the far-field distance (5.2) in case when D > l is given 
as follows:
	
2
2D
r
λ
=
	
(5.2)
where D is the maximum dimension of the radiating structure and r is the distance 
from the antenna. Note that this is only an estimate, and the transition from near 
to far field is not abrupt. 
Typically, D for reader antennas is 0.3m (1 foot.) The far-field distance in UHF 
ISM band in the United States (λ = 0.33m) can be estimated to be 0.56m.

5.2  Near-Field and Far-Field Propagation 
133
Generally speaking, the radiating near-field or transition region is defined as a 
region between a reactive near field and a far field. In this region, antenna pattern is 
taking shape but is not fully formed, and the antenna gain will vary with distance.

The solution of Maxwell’s equations for the fields around an antenna consists 
of three different powers of the range: 1/r, 1/r2, and 1/r3. At very short ranges, the 
higher powers dominate the solution, while the first power dominates at longer 
ranges. This can be interpreted as the electromagnetic wave breaking free from the 
antenna. 
The near field may be thought of as the transition point where the laws of op-
tics must be replaced by Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism.
5.2.1  Far-Field Propagation and Backscatter Principle
RFID systems based on UHF and higher frequencies use far-field communication 
and the physical property of backscattering or “reflected” power. Far-field commu-
nication is based on radio waves in which the reader sends a continuous base signal 
frequency that is reflected back by the tag’s antenna. During the process, the tag 
encodes the signal to be reflected with the information from the tag (the ID) using 
a technique called modulation (i.e., changing the amplitude or phase of the waves 
returned) [2]. 
The concept of the radian sphere, which has a value for its radius of r = λ/2π, 
helps in the visualization of whether the tag coupling is in the near or far field. If 
the tag is inside this sphere, the reactive energy storage fields (dipolar field terms) 
dominate, and the near-field coupling volume theory is used. If the tag falls outside 
the sphere, then propagating plane wave EM fields dominate and the familiar an-
tenna engineering concepts of gain, effective area or aperture, and EIRP are used. 
These often more familiar EM concepts, whereby real power is radiated into free 
space, are relevant to the cases of UHF and microwave tagging technologies.
Most theoretical analysis, at least in the first approximation, assumes the so-
called free-space propagation. Free space simply means that there is no material or 
other physical phenomenon present except the phenomenon under consideration. 
Free space is considered the baseline (ideal) state of the electromagnetic field. Ra-
diant energy propagates through free space in the form of electromagnetic waves, 
such as radio waves and visible light (among other electromagnetic spectrum fre-
quencies). Of course, this model rarely describes the actual propagation accurately; 
phenomena such as reflection, diffraction, and scattering exist that disturb radio 
propagation. 
In the wireless industry, most models and formulas we use today are semi-em-
pirical, that is, based on the well-known radio propagation laws but modified with 
certain factors and coefficients derived from the field experience. RFID is definitely 
an area where this practice is required; short distances cluttered with multiple tags

and/or other objects are potential obstacles to radio propagation and will cause 
serious deviations, predictable or not, from the theoretical calculations.
A backscatter tag operates by modulating the electronics connected to the an-
tenna in order to control the reflection of incident electromagnetic energy. For suc-
cessful reading of a passive tag, two physical requirements must be met:
1.	 Forward power transfer: Sufficient power must be transferred into the tag 
to energize the circuitry inside. The power transferred will be proportional 
to the second power of the distance.
2.	 The radar equation: The reader must be able to detect and resolve the small 
fraction of energy returned to it. The power received will be reduced pro-
portional to the fourth power of the distance.
5.2.1.1  Forward Power Transfer
A typical RFID tag consists of an antenna and an integrated circuit (chip), both with 
complex impedances. The chip obtains power from the RF signal transmitted by the 
RFID reader. RFID tag antenna is loaded with the chip whose impedance switches 
between two impedance states, usually high and low. At each impedance state, 
RFID tag presents a certain radar cross section (RCS). The tag sends the informa-
tion back by varying its input impedance and thus modulating the backscattered 
signal.
In Figure 5.1 ZA = RA + jXA is the complex antenna impedance and ZC = RC 
+ jXC is the complex chip (load) impedance; chip impedance may vary with the 
frequency and the input power to the chip. 
The power scattered back from the loaded antenna can be divided into two 
parts. One part is called structural mode and is due to currents induced on the 
antenna when it is terminated with complex conjugate impedance. The second part 
is called antenna mode and is a result of a mismatch between antenna impedance 
and load impedance.
Figure 5.1  Forward power transfer.

5.2  Near-Field and Far-Field Propagation 
135
The separation between the antennas is r, which is assumed to be large enough 
for the tag to be in the far field of the reader. The efficiency of the matching net-
work will be taken as unity and ignored (losses in the network may also be ac-
counted for in the value of GT). 
Antenna gains GR and GT are expressed relative to an isotropic antenna. Polar-
ization mismatch between antennas is assumed negligible.
Let us assume for a moment that electromagnetic waves propagate under ideal 
conditions (i.e., without dispersion). If high-frequency energy is emitted by an iso-
tropic radiator, then the energy propagates uniformly in all directions. Areas with 
the same power flux density therefore form spheres (A = 4πr2) around the radiator.
Here

 is a nondirectional power flux density, S, from an isotropic an-
tenna. An isotropic radiator is a theoretical, lossless, omnidirectional (spherical) 
antenna. That is, it radiates uniformly in all directions. The power of a transmit-
ter that is radiated from an isotropic antenna will have a uniform power density 
(power per unit area) in all directions. In other words, the spreading out of electro-
magnetic energy in free space is determined by the inverse square law.
The directional power flux density at a distant point from a real reader antenna 
with a gain of GR is the power flux density from an isotropic antenna multiplied 
by the reader antenna gain:

The amount of power that is actually received by a tag placed at distance r

power from an incoming electromagnetic wave. For an isotropic antenna with an

 is called the free-space path loss. Free-space 
path loss is proportional to the square of the distance between the transmitter and 
receiver, and also proportional to the square of the frequency of the radio signal.
The typical maximum reader output power is 500 mW, 2W (ERP, CEPT), and 
4W (EIRP, FCC). Converted to dBm, the permitted maximum limits are about 29 
dBm (500-mW ERP, 825-mW EIRP), 35 dBm (2-W ERP, 3.3-W EIRP), and 36 dBm 
(4-W EIRP). 
The gain of the transmitter (reader) antenna (typical value) is assumed to be 
6 dBi. Therefore, the maximum output power from power amplifier should be 23 
dBm, 29 dBm, and 30 dBm, respectively. The tag available power versus distance 
can be seen in Figure 5.2.
From the industrial experience, the minimum RF input power of 10 μW (-20 
dBm) to 50 μW (-13 dBm) is required to power on the tag. The power received by 
the tag is then divided in two parts: the reflected power and the available power 
used by the chip. The distribution of these two parts is very critical for obtaining a 
maximum distance. For dipole antennas presented in the best orientation, GT may 
be taken as 2 dBi (gain over isotropic with allowance for losses, approximately 
1.6).

Note that PRGR is the EIRP of the reader. The maximum practical value of the 
input resistance, RC, is 600Ω. The received voltage VTag must be large enough to be 
rectified and power the tag; a voltage in excess of 1.2 Vrms may be required. This 
is with the tag presented to the interrogating field in the ideal orientation and with 
no power margin. 
It would be interesting to find out what is a required transmit power of the 
reader in order to have a large enough tag voltage for reliable operation. If we as-
sume that the tag’s RMS voltage is 1.6V, we can calculate PTag:

of the reader and the tag to be 2 dBi or 1.6), the required reader power at 1-m 
distance is 2.42W.

The relationship between the electrical field strength and the power flux den-
sity is the same as between voltage and power in an electrical circuit; from (5.4) and

5.2.1.2  The Radar Equation
Radar principles tell us that the amount of energy reflected by an object is depen-
dent on the reflective area of the object: the larger the area, the greater the reflec-
tion. This property is referred to as the RCS. The RCS is an equivalent area from 
which energy is collected by the target and retransmitted (backscattered) back to 
the source. 
For an RFID system in which the tag changes its reflectivity in order to convey 
its stored identity and data to the reader, this is referred to as differential radar 
cross-section or ∆RCS. Calculations of the complete return signal path are conve-
niently conducted in terms of the ∆RCS of the backscatter device. 
For the antenna to transfer maximum energy to the chip, the impedance of the 
chip must be a conjugate of the antenna impedance, ZA. However it is important 
to remember that the logic circuits of a chip used in a tag draw very little power 
relative to the amount of power consumed by the chip RF input circuits. As the 
modulator switches between two states, the load impedance of the chip, ZC, will 
switch between two states. 
The reflection due to a mismatch between antenna and load in a backscatter 
tag is analogous to the reflection found in transmission lines and may be expressed 
in terms of coefficient of reflection, ρ:

In a transmission line theory, we define a voltage reflection coefficient (at the 
load) as the ratio of reflected voltage to incident voltage, which can, in general, be 
a complex number. As already mentioned in more detail in Chapter 3, three special 
cases are possible:

5.2  Near-Field and Far-Field Propagation 
139
•• Matched load, ZC = ZA, no reflection, ρ = 0;
•• Open load, ZC = ∞, full in-phase reflection, ρ = +1;
•• Shorted load, ZC = 0, full out-of-phase reflection, ρ = –1.
The coefficient of reflection, ρ, will therefore change as the modulator switches 
between two states. When the tag modulator is in the off state, the chip input im-
pedance will be closely matched to the antenna impedance; therefore, the reflectiv-
ity will be low and hence the SWR will approach 1. When the modulator is in the 
on state, the tag antenna impedance will be mismatched and so the reflectivity will 
be high, and the SWR will tend to infinity, causing the maximum amount of power 
to be reflected.
The tag varies its RCS by changing the impedance match of the tag antenna 
between two (or more) states. The ratio between the states is called the differential 
coefficient of reflectivity represented by the symbol ∆ρ and may be calculated using 
well-known transmission line theory, a summary of which is provided next. 
Signal propagation follows the well-known Friis transmission formula2; ana-
lytical approaches like the Friis equation assume undisturbed near-field conditions 
(i.e., no proximity of dielectric or metal objects), known antenna characteristics, 
and no diffraction and reflection effects.

where the IC is in states 1 and 2 for a fraction of time, p1 and p2, respectively [3]. 
It is worth mentioning that in case the tag modulator switches from a perfectly 
matched state (ρ2 = 0) to a short circuit state or to an open circuit state (ρ1 = 1), 
Δρ will be approximately 0.5. Lower (and more realistic) modulation ratios will 
result in a Δρ < 0.5. However, in those cases where the modulator switches from 
a state where the chip has an impedance higher than the antenna impedance, to 
a condition where it is lower than the antenna impedance, Δρ will represent the 
difference between the two states, in which case Δρ could be greater than 0.5 (but 
never higher than 1).
In modulation schemes, where one of the two states is active most of the time 
(e.g., p1 << p2), this is a good choice in terms of power efficiency, but these schemes 
require a much larger bandwidth (due to the short gaps) which is often prohibited 
by national authorities’ regulations. Assuming that both states are active an equal 
amount of time (as it is in ASK with total mismatch in one state), that is, p1 = p2 = 
0.5, and assuming there are no antenna losses, 50% of the available input power is 
2.	
The formula was derived in 1945 by the Danish-American radio engineer Harald T. Friis at Bell Labs.

actually available for rectification, 25% is used as backscattered modulated power, 
and the remaining 25% is wasted.
The σ is the ∆RCS of the tag and PRet is the power returned to the reader. The 
radar cross-section (RCS),3 ∆RCS, of the tag antenna is equivalent to the antenna 
effective aperture Ae, when the tag is matched. For the ∆RCS, when the tag antenna 
is mismatched, theoretically speaking, we can say that:

where GT is the gain of the tag antenna (GT is squared because the signal is received 
and reradiated), λ is the wavelength, and Δρ is the differential reflection coefficient 
of the tag modulator. 
First, we assume that electromagnetic waves propagate under ideal conditions, 
that is, without dispersion. If high-frequency energy is emitted by an isotropic ra-
diator, than the energy propagate uniformly in all directions. Areas with the same 
power density therefore form spheres (A = 4πr2) around the radiator (see Figure 
5.3). 
As discussed in a previous section, the same amount of energy spreads out on 
an incremented spherical surface at an incremented spherical radius. That means 
that the power density on the surface of a sphere is inversely proportional to the 
radius of the sphere. So we get the formula to calculate the nondirectional power 
flux density, at the distance r:

where PR is the power transmitted from the reader.
Because a spherical segment emits radiation equally in all direction (at constant 
transmit power), if the power radiated is redistributed to provide more radiation 
in one direction, resulting in an increase of the power density in direction of the 
radiation. This effect is called antenna gain and it is obtained by directional radia-
tion of the power. 
So, from the definition, the directional power flux density, SD, is equal to:

The target (tag in our case) detection is not only dependent on the power den-
sity at the tag’s position, but also on how much power is reflected in the direction 
of the radar (reader in our case). In order to determine the useful reflected power, 
it is necessary to know the RCS, σ. This quantity depends on several factors, but 
it is a general rule that a bigger area reflects more power than a smaller area. For 
example, a jumbo jet offers a higher RCS than a sporting aircraft in the same flight 
situation. Beyond this, the reflecting area depends on design, surface composition, 
and materials used. 
Keeping all this in mind, we can say that the returned (reflected) power PRet 
towards the RFID reader depends on the distance, power density SD, the reader’s 
antenna gain, GR, and the RCS, σ:

It could be noticed that the received power at the reader depend heavily on the 
distance and decays with the fourth power of the distance. For successful opera-
tion, it is required both that signal at reader’s receiver is above the noise floor and 
that ratio of the power received and transmitted from the reader is not too small. 
Table 5.1 shows the return signal ratio for various situations. Ratios below 100 
dB are both manageable in terms of signal processing and ensure the return signal 
is significantly above the thermal noise floor.

5.2.1.3  Noise
Noise is the major limiting factor in communications system performance. Noise 
can be divided into four categories: thermal noise, intermodulation noise, cross-
talk, and impulse noise. For this analysis, we will only consider thermal noise and 
neglect other potential sources of noise. Now we have to calculate the power of the 
reflected signal at the receiver of the reader and compare it with the thermal noise 
threshold.
Thermal noise results from thermal agitation of electrons; it is present in all 
electronic devices and transmission media and is function of temperature and the 
channel bandwidth. Thermal noise is independent of any specific frequency. Thus, 
the thermal noise power in watts present in a bandwidth of B hertz can be ex-
pressed as:

where Boltzmann’s constant k = 1.3803 × 10–23 J/K and T is the temperature in

The noise figure or noise factor (NF) is a contribution of the device itself to 
thermal noise. It is commonly defined as the signal-to-noise ratio at the input di-
vided by the signal-to-noise ratio at the output and is usually expressed in decibels. 
Typical noise figures range from 0.5 dB for very low noise devices to 4 to 8 dB.

The kelvin is a unit of measurement for temperature and is one of the seven base units in the International 
System of Units (SI). The Kelvin scale is named after the Belfast-born engineer and physicist William Thom-
son, first Baron Kelvin (1824–1907), who wrote of the need for an absolute thermometric scale.

5.2  Near-Field and Far-Field Propagation 
143
In the case of 500-kHz bandwidth, at the room temperature, we can use (5.22) 
and calculate thermal noise of –117 dBm; with addition of the 3-dB receiver noise 
factor, total noise is –114 dBm, leaving enough reader signal margin to the noise 
threshold.
We can be seen that the return power ratio conditions are met at relatively 
longer ranges and that forward power transfer is the limiting factor in UHF back-
scatter tags. Battery-powered backscatter tags overcome this limitation and can be 
read at significantly greater ranges.
5.2.2  Near-Field Propagation Systems
5.2.2.1  Magnetic Field Calculations
At low to mid RFID frequencies, RFID systems make use of near-field communi-
cation and the physical property of inductive coupling from a magnetic field. The 
reader creates a magnetic field between the reader and the tag and this induces an 
electric current in the tag’s antenna, which is used to power the integrated circuit 
and obtain the ID. It is important to remember here that the term antenna actually 
means the magnetically coupled coil, and not an antenna in a radio propagation 
sense.
The ID is communicated back to the reader by varying the load on the anten-
na’s coil, which changes the current drawn on the reader’s communication coil. In 
the near field, it is possible to have an electric field with very little magnetic field or 
a magnetic field with very little electric field. The choice between these two alterna-
tives is determined by the design of the interrogation antenna, and RFID systems 
are generally designed to minimize any incidental electric field generation.
In the near field, the magnetic field strength attenuates according to the rela-
tionship 1/r3 (i.e., the magnetic field intensity decays rapidly as the inverse cube of 
the distance between the reader antenna and the tag). In power terms, this equates 
to a drastic 1/r6 reduction with distance (60 dB/decade) of the available power to 
energize the tag. 
The magnetic field strength is high in the immediate vicinity of the transmit-
ting coil, but a very low level exists in the distant far-field; hence, a spatially well-
confined interrogation region or localized tag reading zone is created. Note that 
magnetic loop reader antennas can also be designed that exhibit good electrical 
symmetry and balance to eliminate stray electric E-field pick-up. 
The tag’s ability to efficiently draw energy from the reader’s field is based on 
the well-known electrical resonance effect. The coupling or antenna element of 
the tag is really an inductor coil and capacitor connected together and designed to 
resonate at the 13.56-MHz system operating frequency (Figure 5.4). 
The current passing through the inductor creates a surrounding magnetic field 
according to Ampere’s law. The created magnetic field B (expressed in tesla5) is not 
a propagating wave [4], but rather an attenuating carrier wave (Figure 5.5), with 
its strength calculated using the following formula: 
5.	
The tesla (symbol T) is the SI-derived unit of magnetic flux density (or magnetic induction). It is used to de-
fine the intensity (density) of a magnetic field. It is named in honor of world-renowned inventor, scientist, 
and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. The tesla, equal to 1 weber per square meter, was defined in 1960.

As one moves away from the source with r >> a, the simplified equation (5.26) 
shows the characteristic 1/r3 attenuation. This near-field decaying behavior of the 
magnetic field is the main limiting factor in the read range of the RFID device.

From (5.29) with a given coil voltage at some distance from the coil, we can 
now see that B is inversely proportional to N. This is due to the fact that the current 
increases at the rate of 1/N2 with a given coil voltage V. Only the case of an air-
coiled inductor has been described, but the ferrite-cored inductor could be used as 
well. Adding a core has the effect of increasing the effective surface area, enabling 
one to reduce the physical size of the coil.
To maximize the magnetic field, given fixed antenna dimensions, (5.26) dic-
tates that the current delivered to the antenna must be maximized. Additionally, to 
maximize current, the antenna must resonate at the excitation frequency provided 
by the reader circuit. Resonance frequency, f0, of the reader is determined by the 
inductance, L, of the antenna (determined by the radius of the coil, the number of 
windings, the thickness of the windings, and the length of the coil) and a tuning 
capacitor, C, and is calculated as follows:

frequency:

In practice, when the tuned circuit is resonating, the sum of its capacitive and 
inductive reactance is zero (XL = XC), and the impedance shown in (5.31) becomes 
purely resistive.
Total resistance is thereby minimized and current through the antenna is maxi-
mized, yielding a maximized magnetic field strength. Passive tags utilize the energy 
provided by the carrier wave through an induced antenna coil voltage. The voltage 
is proportional to the product of the number of turns in the tag antenna and the 
total magnetic flux through the antenna. The ASIC within the tag must receive a 
certain minimum threshold voltage (or power) to operate. 
5.2.2.2  Voltages Induced in Antenna Circuits
Faraday’s law states that a time-varying magnetic field through a surface bounded 
by a closed path induces a voltage around the loop. Figure 5.6 shows a simple ge-
ometry for an RFID application. 
When the tag and reader antennas are in close proximity, the time-varying 
magnetic field, B, produced by a reader antenna coil induces a voltage (called elec-
tromotive force or simply EMF) in the closed tag antenna coil. The induced voltage 
in the coil causes a flow of current through the coil. The induced voltage in the coil 
is equal to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux Ψ:
	
d
V
N dt
ψ
= -
	
(5.32)
where N is the number of turns in the antenna coil and Ψ is the magnetic flux 
through each turn. The negative sign indicates that the induced voltage acts in such 
a way as to oppose the magnetic flux producing it. This is known as Lenz’s law, 
and it emphasizes the fact that the direction of current flow in the circuit is such 
that the induced magnetic field produced by the induced current will oppose the 
original magnetic field. 
The magnetic flux Ψ in (5.33) is the total magnetic field B that is passing 
through the entire surface S of the antenna coil (magnetic field B and surface S are 
vector quantities), and it is found by:

(5.33)
where:
B = magnetic field given in (5.22);
S = surface area of the coil;
• = inner product (cosine angle between two vectors) of vectors B and surface 
area S. 
The above formula for the inner product of two vectors suggests that the total 
magnetic flux ψ that is passing through the antenna coil is affected by an orienta-
tion of the antenna coils. 
The inner product of two vectors becomes minimized when the cosine angle be-
tween the two are 90°, or the two (B field and the surface of coil) are perpendicular 
to each other and maximized when the cosine angle is 0°. The maximum magnetic 
flux that is passing through the tag coil is obtained when the reader coil and tag coil 
are placed in parallel with respect to each other. This condition results in maximum 
induced voltage in the tag coil and also maximum read range. 
The inner product expression also can be expressed in terms of a mutual cou-
pling between the reader and tag coils. The mutual coupling between the two coils 
is also maximized when they are parallel.
Combining expressions given so far, the voltage across the tag antenna, at the 
resonant frequency, can be calculated using the following equation:

f = frequency of the carrier signal; 
S = area of the coil in square meters;
Q = quality factor of the resonant circuit; 
B = strength of magnetic field at the tag; 
θ = angle of the field normal to the tag area.
The Scosθ term in (5.34) represents an effective surface area of the antenna 
coil6 and is defined as an exposed area of the loop to the incoming magnetic field. 
The effective antenna surface area is maximized when cosθ becomes unity (q = 0°), 
which occurs when the antennas of the base station and the transponder units are 
positioned in a face-to-face arrangement. In practical applications, the user might 
notice the longest detection range when the two antennas are facing each other and 
the shortest range when they are orthogonally faced.

It is important to notice that the antenna coil is not a real antenna in a radio communications sense; we 
have to keep in mind that this is just a transformer coil.

Components of the RFID System
Voltage is built up in an onboard storage capacitor, and when sufficient charge 
has accumulated to reach or surpass the circuit operating threshold voltage, the 
electronics power up and begin transmitting data back to the reader. Both the read-
er and the tag must use the same transmission method in order to synchronize and 
successfully exchange data. 
Two main methods of communication occur between the reader and tag: full-
duplex and half-duplex. In a full-duplex configuration, the tag communicates its 
data by modulating the reader’s carrier wave by applying a resistive load. A tran-
sistor (load modulator) within the tag shorts the antenna circuit in sequence to the 
data, removing the antenna from resonance at the excitation frequency, thereby re-
moving its power draw from the reader’s carrier wave. At the reader side, the load-
ing and unloading is detected and the data can be reconstructed. In a half-duplex 
RFID system, the carrier wave transmits power and then pauses. Within the pause, 
the tag transmits the data back to the reader.
For a given tag, the operating voltage obtained at a distance r from the reader 
is directly proportional to the flux density at that distance. The magnetic field 
emitted by the reader antenna decreases in power proportional to 1/r3 in the near 
field. Therefore, it can be shown (5.35) that for a circularly coiled antenna, the flux 
density is maximized at a distance r (in meters) when:

(5.35)
where a is the radius of the reader’s antenna coil. Thus, by increasing a, the com-
munication range of the reader may be increased, and the optimum reader antenna 
radius a equals 1.41 times the demanded read range r. It is obvious that for some 
applications very large reader antennas may be required.
The quality factor, Q, of the coupling element defines how well the resonating 
circuit absorbs power over its relatively narrow resonance band. In general, the 
higher the Q, the higher the power output for a particular sized antenna. Unfor-
tunately, too high a Q may conflict with the bandpass characteristics of the reader 
and the increased ringing could create problems in the protocol bit timing. 
In smart-label RFID applications, the Q value demanded is reasonably high. 
Because most of the resonant circuit’s tuning capacitance is located within the 
microchip where high capacitor Q can be realized, the effective circuit Q value 
is determined mainly by the antenna coil losses. The coil Q is usually calculated 
(without taking into account additional parasitic capacitance losses) according to 
the following equation:

In (5.36), Rs is the coil’s total effective series loss resistance and takes into ac-
count both the dc resistance and the ac resistance due to high frequency current 
flow concentration caused by skin-effect phenomena in the conductor windings. 
Practical smart-label systems usually operate with a coupling element resona-
tor Q within the range of 20 to 80. The Q of the LC circuit is typically around 20 
for an air-core inductor and about 40 for a ferrite-core inductor. Higher Q values

than this are generally not feasible because the information-bearing amplitude 
modulated reply sidebands are undesirably attenuated by the resonator’s bandpass 
frequency response characteristic. At resonance, the induced RF voltage produced 
across the tuned tag and delivered to the microchip will be Q times greater than for 
frequencies outside of the resonant bandwidth. 
Figure 5.7 shows the frequency response curve for a typical serial resonant tank 
circuit. A good rule of thumb is to stay within the -3-dB limits; for the individual 
manufacturing tolerances for capacitance and inductance of 2%, a Q of 30 can be 
used. Lower tolerance components may be used at the expense of sensitivity and, 
thus, yield a lower range. The corresponding final design must accommodate a 
wider bandwidth and will, therefore, have a lower response.
As a resonant application, the smart-label tag can be affected by the environ-
mental detuning effects that may cause a reduction in transponder sensitivity and 
reading distance. Undesirable changes in the tag’s parasitic capacitance and effec-
tive inductance can happen easily. The presence of metal and different dielectric 
mediums can cause detuning and introduce damping resulting from dissipative en-
ergy losses. Such permeable materials can also distort the magnetic flux lines to 
weaken the energy coupling to the tag. However, these effects can largely be over-
come when they are taken into account during the label and system design phase. 
Clusters of tagged objects that sometimes come together in close physical prox-
imity to each other can also exhibit significant detuning effects caused by their 
mutual inductances. This shift in tuning is called resonance splitting and occurs 
whenever resonant circuits, such as near-field tags, come in close physical proxim-
ity to each other. They become coupled tuned circuits, and the degree of coupling 
(called the coupling coefficient, k) determines the amount of frequency shift. The 
value of k depends on the coil geometry (size and shape) and spacing distance. 
Bigger area coils are inherently more susceptible to deleterious mutual coupling 
effects. When in close proximity, the magnetic flux lines of the individual coils 
overlap and the coils exhibit mutual inductance. This mutual inductance generally 
adds to the coil’s normal inductance and produces a downward shift in the effec-
tive resonant frequency. This, in turn, results in the tag receiving less energy from 
the reader field and hence the reading distance decreases accordingly. The higher

the tag Q, the more pronounced is the effect. Closely coupled tags can also have 
problems with commands signaled from the reader being misinterpreted due to 
cross-coupling between tags.
This rapid attenuation of the energizing and data communication field with in-
creasing distance is the fundamental reason why 13.56-MHz passive RFID systems 
have a maximum reading distance of the order of about 1m (3 feet). This is also 
the reason why well-designed near-field RFID systems have good immunity to envi-
ronmental noise and electrical interference. All these characteristics are particularly 
well suited to many smart-label applications.
The efficiency of power transfer between the antenna coil of the reader and 
the transponder is proportional to the operating frequency, the number of wind-
ings, the area enclosed by the transponder coil, the angle of the two coils relative 
to each other, and the distance between the two coils. As frequency increases, the 
required coil inductance of the transponder coil, and thus the number of windings, 
decreases. For 135 kHz it is typically 100 to 1,000 windings, and for 13.56 MHz, 
typically 3 to 10 windings. Because the voltage induced in the transponder is still 
proportional to frequency, the reduced number of windings barely affects the ef-
ficiency of power transfer at higher frequencies.

5.3.1  Tag Considerations
There really is no such thing as a typical RFID tag. The read range is a balancing 
act between numbers of engineering trade-offs and ultimately depends on many 
factors. It depends on the frequency of RFID system operation, the power of the 
reader, and interference from other RF devices. 
Several general RFID tag design requirements whose relative importance de-
pends on tag application are discussed here [5]. These requirements largely deter-
mine the criteria for selecting an RFID tag antenna:
•• Frequency band: Desired frequency band of operation depends on the regula-
tions of the country where tag will be used.
•• Size and form: Tag form and size must be such that it can be embedded or 
attached to the required objects (cardboard boxes, airline baggage strips, 
identification cards, and so on) or fit inside a printed label (see Figure 5.8).
•• Read rang: Minimum required read range is usually specified.
•• EIRP: EIRP is determined by local country regulations (active versus passive 
tags).
•• Surrounding: Tag performance changes when it is placed on different objects 
(e.g., cardboard boxes with various contents) or when other objects are pres-
ent in the vicinity of the tagged object. A tag’s antenna can be designed or 
tuned for optimum performance on a particular object or designed to be less 
sensitive to the content on which the tag is placed.
•• Orientation (also called polarization): The read range depends on antenna ori-
entation. How tags are placed with respect to the polarization of the reader’s 

5.3  Tags 
151
field can have a significant effect on the communication distance for both HF 
and UHF tags, resulting in a reduced operating range of up to 50%. In the case of 
the tag being displaced by 90°, the reader may not being able to read the tag at all.  
  The optimal orientation for HF tags is for the two antenna coils (reader 
and tag) to be parallel to each other (see Figure 5.9). UHF tags are even more 
sensitive to polarization due to the directional nature of the dipole fields. 
Some applications require a tag to have a specific directivity pattern such as 
omnidirectional or hemispherical coverage. 
•• Applications with mobility: The RFID tag may be used in situations where 
tagged objects like pallets or boxes travel on a conveyor belt at speeds up to 
600 feet/min. The Doppler shift in this case is less than 30 Hz at 915 MHz 
and does not affect RFID operation. However, the tag spends less time in the 
Figure 5.8  RFID label cross-section.

Components of the RFID System
read field of RFID reader, demanding high read-rate capability. In such cases, 
RFID system must be carefully planned to ensure reliable tag identification.
•• Cost: RFID tag must be a low-cost device, thus imposing restrictions both on 
antenna structure and on the choice of materials for its construction includ-
ing the ASIC used. Typical conductors used in tags are copper, aluminum, 
and silver ink. The dielectrics include flexible polyester and rigid PCB sub-
strates like FR4.
•• Reliability: RFID tag must be a reliable device that can sustain variations 
due to temperature, humidity, and stress and survive such processes as label 
insertion, printing, and lamination.
•• Power for the tag: An active tag has its own battery and does not rely on the 
reader for any function. Its range is greater than passive tags. Passive tags rely 
on the reader for power to perform all functions, and semipassive tags rely on 
the reader for powering transmission but the battery for powering their own 
circuitry. For comparison, see Table 5.2.
5.3.2  Data Content of RFID Tags
5.3.2.1  Read-Only Systems
Read-only systems can be considered low-end; these tags usually only contain an 
individual serial number that is transmitted when queried by a reader and basically 
can be used to replace the functionality of bar codes. Due to the structural simplic-
ity of read-only tags, costs and energy consumption can be kept down.
More advanced tags contain logics and memory, so they support writing and 
information can be updated or changed remotely. High-end tags have micropro-
cessors enabling complex algorithms for encryption and security. More energy is 
needed for these than for less complex electronics.
One-bit tags can be detected, but they do not contain any other information. 
They are very useful for protecting items in a shop against shoplifters. A system 
like this is called Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) and has been in use since the 
1970s. In practice, this system can be identified by the large gates of coils or anten-
nas at the exits of shops. 
Read-only tags that contain more than 1 bit of data are simple ones that only 
contain a unique serial number that it transmits on request. The contents of the 
read-only chips are usually written during manufacturing. The serial number can, 
for example, be coded by cutting small bridges on the chip. Usually these simple 
chips also contain some logic for anticollision, thus allowing multiple tags to be 
read simultaneously.

Different principles of operation can be used for the 1-bit tags. For example, 
the principle of the microwaves tags is quite simple; it uses the generation of har-
monics by diodes, that is, frequencies that are an integer multiples of the original 
frequency. 
The tag is a small antenna that has a diode in the middle. Because the diode 
only lets current pass one way, the oscillations that get trapped behind the diode 
generate a frequency twice the original frequency. The system sends out a micro-
wave signal, for example, 2.45 GHz, and listens for the first harmonics at 4.90 
GHz. If a tag is present, it generates harmonics that can be detected. 
However, false alarms may be caused by other sources of this particular fre-
quency. In order to avoid such false alarms, a modulation signal of, for example, 
100 kHz is added to the interrogation signal. This means that the same modulating 
signal can also be found in the reflected signal from the tags. 
5.3.2.2  Read-Write Systems
Many read-only tags are factory programmed and carry an ID number (tag ID). 
Other tags, including read/write devices, can also carry a tag identifier that is used 
to unambiguously identify a tag. This identifier is distinct from user-introduced 
identifiers for supporting other application needs.
•• Read-only devices: They are generally less costly and may be factory pro-
grammable read-only or one time programmable (OTP). One-time program-
mability provides the opportunity to write once then read many times, thus 
supporting passport-type applications, in which data can be added at key 
points during the lifetime or usage of an item, and thus providing an incor-
ruptible history or audit trail for the item data. 
•• Write once/read many (WORM): Some chips allow writing only once and 
read many times. These tags are versatile since they can be written with a 
serial number when applied to an item, instead of linking a predefined serial 
number to an item. More advanced chips allow both reading and writing 
multiple times, and the contents of a tag can be altered remotely by a scanner.
•• Read/write data carriers: They offer the facility for changing the content 
of the carrier as and when appropriate within a given application. Some 
devices will have both a read-only and read-write component that can sup-
port both identification and other data carrier needs. The read-write capa-
bility can clearly support applications in which an item, such as a container 
or assembly support, is reusable and requires some means of carrying data 
about its contents or on what is being physically carried. It is also signifi-
cant for lifetime applications such as maintenance histories, where a need 
is seen to add or modify data concerning an item over a period of time. 
The read/write capability may also be exploited within flexible manufac-
turing to carry and adjust manufacturing information and item-attendant 
details, such as component tolerances. A further important use of read/write 
is for local caching of data as a portable data file, using it as and when re-
quired, and selectively modifying it as appropriate to meet process needs. 
  Additionally, the chip must be able to resolve who can access it and prevent 

154 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
wrong people from altering its contents. For secure data transmission, some 
kind of encryption is added as well.
•• Time to read is the time it takes to read a tag, which, of course, is related to 
data transfer rate. For example, a system operating at 1-kbps transfer rate 
will take approximately 0.1 second to read a 96-bit tag. Various factors can 
influence read time including competing readers and tags (reader access and 
multiple tags).
5.3.3  Passive Tags
5.3.3.1  About Passive Tags
Passive RFID devices have no power supply built in, meaning that electrical current 
transmitted by the RFID reader inductively powers the device, which allows it to 
transmit its information back. 
Because the passive tag has a limited supply of power, its transmission is much 
more limited than an active tag, typically no more than simply an ID number. 
Similarly, passive devices have a limited range of broadcast, requiring the reader be 
significantly closer than an active one would. Applications for passive devices tend 
to include inventory, product shipping and tracking, hospitals and other medical 
purposes, and antitheft, where it is practical to have a reader within the few meters 
or so of the RFID device. Passive devices are ideal in places that prevent the replace-
ment of a battery, such as implanted into the human body or placed under the skin. 
Tags consist of a silicon device (chip) and antenna circuit (Figure 5.10). The 
purpose of the antenna circuit is to induce an energizing signal and to send a modu-
lated RF signal and the read range of a tag largely depends upon the antenna circuit 
and size. The antenna circuit is made of a LC resonant circuit or E-field dipole an-
tenna, depending on the carrier frequency. The LC resonant circuit is used for fre-
quencies of less than 100 MHz. At these frequencies, the communication between 
the reader and tag is achieved with magnetic coupling between the two antennas. 
An antenna utilizing inductive coupling is often called a magnetic dipole antenna. 
The antenna circuits must be designed in such a way to maximize the magnetic 
coupling between them. This can be achieved with the following parameters:
Figure 5.10  13.56-MHz RFID tags.

5.3  Tags 
155
•• The LC circuit must be tuned to the carrier frequency of the reader.
•• The Q of the tuned circuit must be maximized.
•• The antenna size must be maximized within physical limit of application 
requirement.
The passive RFID tags sometimes use backscattering of the carrier frequency 
for sending data from the tag to the reader. The amplitude of backscattering signal 
is modulated with the data of the tag device. The modulation data can be encoded 
in the form of ASK (NRZ or Manchester), FSK, or PSK. 
During backscatter modulation, the incoming RF carrier signal to the tag is 
loaded and unloaded, causing amplitude modulation of the carrier, correspond-
ing to the tag data bits. The RF voltage induced in the tag’s antenna is amplitude 
modulated by the modulation signal (data) of the tag device. This amplitude modu-
lation can be achieved by using a modulation transistor across the LC resonant 
circuit or partially across the resonant circuit. Changes in the voltage amplitude of 
the tag’s antenna can affect the voltage of the reader antenna. By monitoring the 
changes in the reader antenna voltage (due to the tag’s modulation data), the data 
in the tag can be reconstructed.
The RF voltage link between the reader and tag antennas are often compared 
to weakly coupled transformer coils; as the secondary winding, tag coil, is momen-
tarily shunted, the primary winding, reader coil, experiences a momentary voltage 
change. Opening and shunting the secondary, tag coil, in sequence with the tag data 
are seen as amplitude modulation at the primary, reader coil. 
5.3.3.2  RFID Chip Description
An RFID tag consists of an RFID chip, an antenna, and tag packaging. The RFID 
circuitry itself consists of an RF front end, some additional basic signal processing 
circuits, logic circuitry to implement the algorithms required, and EEPROM for 
storage. The RFID chip is an integrated circuit implemented in silicon [6]. 
The major blocks and their functions of the RFID front end are: 
•• Rectifier: From the coupled EM field it generates the power supply voltage 
for all the electronic circuits;
•• Power (voltage) regulator: Maintains the power supply at a certain level and 
at the same time protects the circuit from the excessively large input RF 
power;
•• Demodulator: Extracts the data symbols embedded in the carrier waveforms;
•• Clock extraction or generation: Extracts the clock out of carrier (usually in 
HF systems) or generates the system clock;
•• Backscattering: Modulates the return link by alternating the impedance of 
the chip;
•• Power on reset: Generates the chip power-on reset (POR) signal;
•• Voltage (current) reference: Generates some voltage or current reference for 
the use of front-end and other circuit blocks, usually in terms of bandgap 
reference;

156 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
•• Other circuits: They include persistent node or short-term memory, electro-
static discharge protection, and so forth.
Figure 5.11 describes a block diagram for RFID IC circuits and lists many of its 
associated function blocks. The RF front end is connected to the antenna, and typi-
cally, at UHF, an electric dipole antenna is used while HF tags use a coil antenna. 
The front-end circuitry impacts the semiconductor process by requiring a process 
that allows for mixed mode fabrication. Passive RF tags have no power source and 
rely on the signal from the reader to power up; thus, the RF front end implements 
modulators, voltage regulators, resets, and connections to the external antenna. 
RFID chips have control logic that typically consists of a few thousand gates. 
The lowest level chip uses very few gates, in the order of 1,500 gate equivalents. 
Functions in the logic include the error and parity/CRC checkers, data encoders, 
anticollision algorithms, controllers, and command decoders. More complex RFID 
chips may include security primitives and even tamper-proofing hardware. The size 
of the circuit affects the number of mask, metal, and poly layers required in the 
semiconductor process, and RFID systems usually use CMOS.
A certain amount of information is stored on-chip in an EEPROM. The size of 
this EEPROM increases as more information is required to be on the RFID chip. 
Figure 5.11  RFID tag circuit block diagram.

5.3  Tags 
157
The size of the required EEPROM is a factor in determining the number of mask, 
metal, and poly layers required in the semiconductor fabrication process. It is also a 
factor in the size of the final semiconductor die. Silicon cost is directly proportional 
to both the die size and the number of mask, poly, and metal layers. 
The IC in an RFID tag must be attached to an antenna to operate. The antenna 
captures and transmits signals to and from the reader. The coupling from the reader 
to the tag provides both the transmission data and the power to operate the passive 
RFID tag. Typically antennas for passive RFID systems can be either simple dipole 
for 915-MHz RFID tags or more complex coiled shapes for 13.56-MHz systems.
The digital anticollision system is one of the major and most important parts 
of the tag chip, since it not only implements the slotted ALOHA random anticol-
lision algorithm, but also executes read/write operation of memory. As we know, 
the power consumption of memory is very difficult to reduce. Even more, besides 
the power consumption, the efficiency of the RF front-end rectifier prefers lower 
output dc voltage. So it is very important to design a low-power, low-voltage digital 
anticollision system to achieve maximum operating range.
Currently, antennas are made of metals or metal pastes and typically cost as 
much as 12 cents per antenna to manufacture. However, new methods that range 
from conductive inks and new antenna deposition and stamping techniques are 
expected to reduce costs below 1 cent. 
5.3.4  Active Tags
5.3.4.1  Active Tag Description
An active tag usually performs a specialized task and has an on-board power source, 
usually a battery. It does not require inductions to provide current, as is true of the 
passive tags. The active tag can be designed with a variety of specialized electronics 
including microprocessors, different types of sensors, or I/O devices. Depending on 
the target function of the tag, this information can be processed and stored for im-
mediate or later retrieval by a reader. 
Active RFID tags, also called transponders because they contain a transmit-
ter that is always on, are powered by a battery about the size of a coin, and are 
designed for communications up to 30m (100 feet) from the RFID reader (Figure 
5.12). They are larger and more expensive than passive RFID tags, but can hold 
more data about the product and are commonly used for high-value asset tracking. 
A feature that most active tags have and most passive tags do not is the ability to 
store data received from a transceiver. 
Active tags are ideal in environments with electromagnetic interference since 
they can broadcast a stronger signal in situations that require a greater distance 
between the tag and the transmitter. 
The additional space taken up by a battery in an active device necessitates that 
the active devices are substantially larger than the passive devices. To date, com-
mercially available passive tags are as small as 0.4 mm square and thinner than a 
sheet of paper. In contrast, commercially available active tags are still only as small 
as a coin, which means that active tags are around 50 times the size of passive ones.
For the read-only device, the information that is in the memory cannot be 
changed by an RF command once it has been written. A device with memory cells 

158 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
that can be reprogrammed by RF commands is called a read/write device. The in-
formation in the memory can be reprogrammed by interrogator command.
Although passive tags can only respond to an electromagnetic wave signal 
emitted from a reader, active tags can also spontaneously transmit an ID. There are 
various types of unscheduled transmission type, such as when there are changes in 
vibration or temperature. 
A semiactive or semipassive tag (naming convention depends on the manufac-
turer) also has an on-board battery. The battery in this case is only used to operate 
the chip. Like the passive tag, it uses the energy in the electromagnetic field to wake 
up the chip and to transmit the data to the reader. These tags are sometimes called 
battery-assisted passive (BAP).
5.3.4.2  Active Tag Classification
Two types of tag systems can generally be recognized within active RFID systems.
Wake-up tag systems are deactivated, or asleep, until activated by a coded mes-
sage from a reader or interrogator. In the sleep mode, limiting the current drain to 
a low-level alert function conserves the battery energy. Where larger memories are 
accommodated, there is also generally a need to access data on an object or internal 
file basis to avoid having to transfer the entire amount of data so held. These are 
used in toll payment collection, checkpoint control, and in tracking cargo.
Awake tag or beacon systems are, as the term suggests, responsive to inter-
rogation without a coded message being required to switch the tag from an en-
ergy conservation mode. Because greater switching rate is generally associated with 
higher energy usage, these tags generally operate at a lower data transfer rates and 
memory sizes than wake-up tags, so they conserve battery energy in this way. This 
type of tag is the most widely used of the two, and because of lower component 
costs it is generally less expensive than wake-up tag systems. 
Beacons are used in most real-time locating systems (RTLS), where the precise 
location of an asset needs to be tracked. In an RTLS, a beacon emits a signal with 
its unique identifier at preset intervals, every 3 seconds or once a day, depending on 
how important it is to know the location of an asset at a particular moment in time.

5.3.5  Active And Passive Tags Comparison
Active RFID and passive RFID technologies, while often considered and evaluated 
together, are fundamentally distinct technologies with substantially different capa-
bilities. In most cases, neither technology provides a complete solution for supply 
chain asset management applications; rather, the most effective and complete sup-
ply chain solutions leverage the advantages of each technology and combine their 
use in complementary ways. 
Passive RFID is most appropriate where the movement of tagged assets is high-
ly consistent and controlled, and little or no security or sensing capability or data 
storage is required. 
Active RFID is best suited where business processes are dynamic or uncon-
strained, movement of tagged assets is variable, and more sophisticated security, 
sensing, and/or data storage capabilities are required.
Passive and active tagging systems present very different deployment issues. Ac-
tive tags contain significantly more sophistication, data management, and security 
concerns. While passive tags are typically well below $1, active tags generally cost 
from $10 to $50, depending on the amount of memory, the battery life required, 
any on-board sensors, and the ruggedness.
5.3.6  Multiple Tag Operation
If many tags are present, then they will all reply at the same time, which at the 
reader end is seen as a signal collision and an indication of multiple tags. The 
reader manages this problem by using an anticollision algorithm designed to allow 
tags to be sorted and individually selected. There are many different types of algo-
rithms (binary tree, ALOHA, and so on), which are defined as part of the protocol 
standards. 
The number of tags that can be identified depends on the frequency and proto-
col used and can typically range from 50 tags per second for HF and up to 200 tags 
per second for UHF. Once a tag is selected, the reader is able to perform a number 
of operations, such as reading the tag’s identifier number or, in the case of a read/
write tag, writing information to it. After finishing its dialogue with the tag, the 
reader can then either remove it from the list or put it on standby until a later time. 
This process continues under control of the anticollision algorithm until all tags 
have been selected. 
When containers or freight are moved on a conveyor or similar equipment in a 
tag reader system, the reader/writer must read and write data to and from moving 
tags (Figure 5.13). For successful access, the following conditions must be satisfied:

This formula shows that when the data transfer volume of the tag (Dt) increas-
es, and the data transfer rate (Dr) decreases, the tag-reader/writer operation time 
(Tc) increases, and operation may fail.

Equation (5.38) shows that when the reader/writer operating area decreases,

operation may fail.

Finally, (5.39) states that the total amount of time spent in the operating area 
must be more than the total time taken by the reader/writer and the detection of all 
tags. If only one type of tag can be used when reading/writing RFID tags attached 
to freight on a conveyor belt, the reader/writer antenna must have a large operating 
area to cope with the conveyor belt’s speed:
•• Tr [seconds] = amount of time tag is in operating area;
•• Tc [seconds] = tag-reader/writer operation time;
•• Dr [bps] = data transfer rate;
•• Dt [bit] = data transfer volume;
•• Acn [count] = average number of tag-reader/writer operations;
•• Vtag [m/second] = tag movement velocity;
•• L [m] = distance tag moves within operating area;
•• Td [sec] = amount of time for detecting existence of all tags.
Virtually all high-volume RFID applications require the ability to read multiple 
tags in the reading field at one time. This is only possible if each RFID tag has a 
unique ID number. One numbering method is the EPC code that contains both an 
item ID number and a serial number. A unique number is the basis for implement-
ing anticollision in any RFID technology.

5.3  Tags 
161
In a multiple-tag operation, in which multiple RFID tags are in the reader/
writer’s operating area, the reader/writer must detect the presence of these mul-
tiple tags, and read/write each of them consecutively (Figure 5.14). This operating 
method is generally referred to as the anticollision protocol and is different from 
the single-tag operation protocol. 
The effects of operating range, tag orientation, tag movement velocity, and the 
presence of metallic substances on multitag operating characteristics are basically 
the same as those on single-tag operating characteristics. One additional problem 
with multitag operating characteristics is that the operating time is several times 
longer than for single-tag operation. Because the reader/writer must read/write each 
tag, the time increases in proportion to the number of tags. Also, since multiple tags 
are used, tags sometimes come into contact or overlap with each other. 
When there are N tags in the operating area, and the Ntag is the number of 
tags, the amount of time for which the tags must be in the operating area (Tr) is 
described by (5.40):

RFID tags attached to containers or freight being transported on a conveyor belt or 
trolleys. When Tc is the operating time for a single tag, and Td is the time required 
to check for the existence of N multitags in an anticollision protocol, (5.41) gives 
an approximation of the maximum time required for the reader/writer to read/

Example:
Tag information volume = 16 bytes;
Data transfer rate (Dr) = 7.8 kbps;
Tc = 0.057 second;
Td = 0.055 second;
N = 10;
TN = (0.057 + 0.055) × 10 = 1.12 seconds.
Therefore, roughly 1.1 seconds are needed for the reader/writer to finish read-
ing/writing all 10 tags. When the tag information volume is 100 bytes, TN becomes 
roughly 7 seconds. For the reader/writer to read/write all the tags, the time required 
for the tags to pass through the operating area (Tr) must be greater than TN.
One unfortunate but real fact about RFID tags is that the quality of tags is 
currently not consistent, and therefore performance is not consistent. There are 
considerable variations in performance from one tag to the next, even among tags 
of the same manufacturer and same model.
5.3.7  Overlapping Tags
In inductive frequency band RFID, the resonance characteristic of the tag antenna 
coil is used for reader/writer operation. As discussed earlier, tag’s resonant fre-
quency, f0, is calculated by:

where 
L [H] = inductance of tag antenna coil;
C [F] = capacitance of tag’s tuning capacitor.
If tags overlap, the inductance of their antenna coils is obstructed, and L in-
creases. In this case, the resonant frequency expressed by formula becomes lower 
(f1 < f0). As a result, the electromagnetic waves (current i) generated by the tag’s coil 
become smaller, and the operating area decreases (see Figure 5.15).

5.3.8.1  Antenna Selection
An antenna is a conductive structure specifically designed to couple or radiate elec-
tromagnetic energy. Antenna structures, often encountered in RFID systems, may 
be used to both transmit and receive electromagnetic energy, particularly data-mod-
ulated electromagnetic energy. 
In the low-frequency (LF) range with short read distances, the tag is in the near 
field of the reader antenna, and the power and signals are transferred by means of 
a magnetic coupling. In the LF range, the tag antenna therefore comprises a coil 
(inductive loops) to which the chip is attached. In the UHF range, in cases where 
the read distances are larger, the tag is located in the far field of the reader antenna. 
The reader and tag are coupled by the electromagnetic wave in free space, to which 
the reader and tag are tuned by means of appropriate antenna structures. 
Good antenna design is a critical factor in obtaining good range and stable 
throughput in a wireless application. This is especially true in low-power and com-
pact designs in which antenna space is less than optimal. The tag antenna should 
be as small as possible and easy to produce. It is important to remember that, in 
general, the smaller the antenna, the lower the radiation resistance and the lower 
the efficiency. 
Printed antennas are very easy to produce. The antenna is attached as a flat 
structure to a substrate. The next stage in the production process often involves at-
taching the chip to the substrate and connecting it to the antenna. This assembly is

called an inlay. An inlay becomes a tag or transponder when it is fixed to an adhe-
sive label or a smart card. Note, however, that the electromagnetic properties of the 
materials surrounding the inlay affect the tag’s ability to communicate. In extreme 
cases, tags cannot be read if unsuitable reader antennas are selected.
Another type of usage involves integration into the object that is to be identi-
fied. Parts of the object can be shaped to form an antenna and the antenna can be 
adjusted optimally to suit the object. This significantly increases readability, while 
simultaneously protecting against counterfeiting.
The size and shape of the tag antenna have a significant effect on tag read rates, 
regardless of the coupling used for communication. There are various types of an-
tennas available, among which the most commonly used are dipole, folded dipole, 
printed dipole, printed patch, squiggle, and log-spiral. Among these, the dipole, 
folded dipole, and squiggle antennas are omnidirectional, thus allowing them to 
be read in all possible tag orientations, relative to the base antenna. On the other 
hand, directional antennas have good read range due to their radiation patterns. 
Care must be taken while choosing an antenna because the antenna impedance 
must match to the ASIC and to free space. The four major considerations when 
selecting an antenna type are as follows:
1.	 Antenna impedance;
2.	 Antenna radiation pattern;
3.	 Nature of the tagged object;
4.	 Vicinity of structures around the tagged object.
When individual system performance is not satisfactory, it is advisable to bring 
redundancy to the system. Low read rates of RFID systems make the deployment 
of redundant antennas and tags to identify the same object an imperative. 
Redundant tags are those tags that carry identical information performing 
identical functions. Dual tags are tags connected to each other having one or two 
antennas and with/without individual or shared memory; n tags serving the same 
purpose as that of dual tags can be used for beneficial use of multiple tags in prod-
uct identification. 
It is observed that both the inductive coupling and backscatter-based tags have 
a dependency on the angle of orientation of tag relative to the reader. The place-
ment of two tags in two flat planes, three tags in the three-dimensional axes, four 
tags along the faces of a regular tetrahedron, and so on, can help in achieving the 
above mentioned goals.
The choice of etched, printed, or stamped antenna is a trade-off between cost 
and performance. For a 13.56-MHz tag, the Q factor of the antenna is very im-
portant for long read range applications. The Q factor is inversely proportional to 
the resistance of the antenna trace. It has been determined that the etched antenna 
is less resistive and inexpensive than the printed antenna with conductive material. 
However, for a very large antenna size (greater than 4 × 4 inches), both etching 
and stamping processes waste too much unwanted material. Therefore, printed or 
wired antennas should be considered as an alternative.
As previously stated, reducing antenna size results in reduced performance. 
Some of the parameters affected are reduced efficiency (or gain), shorter range, 
smaller useful bandwidth, more critical tuning, increased sensitivity to component 

5.3  Tags 
165
and PCB spread, and increased sensitivity to external factors. Several performance 
factors deteriorate with miniaturization, but some antenna types tolerate minia-
turization better than others. How much a given antenna can be reduced in size 
depends on the actual requirements for range, bandwidth, and repeatability. In 
general, an antenna can be reduced to half its natural size with moderate impact 
on performance.
5.3.8.2  Loop Antennas
Passive RFID tags extract all of their power, to both operate and communicate, 
from the reader’s magnetic field. Coupling between the tag and reader is via the mu-
tual inductance of the two loop antennas, and the efficient transfer of energy from 
the reader to the tag directly affects operational reliability and read/write range. 
Loop antennas have the same desirable characteristics as dipoles and mono-
poles; they are inexpensive and simple to construct. Loop antennas are usually 
classified as either electrically small or electrically large based on the circumference 
of the loop. Electrically small loop antennas have circumference C ≤ l/10, and elec-
trically large loop antennas have circumference C ≈ l.
Generally, both 13.56-MHz and 125-kHz RFID tags use parallel resonant LC 
loop antennas tuned to the carrier frequency. The RFID circuit is similar to a trans-
former in which loop inductors magnetically couple when one of the loops, in the 
case of the reader antenna, is energized with an alternating current, thus creating 
an alternating magnetic field. The tag loop antenna acts like the secondary of a 
transformer, where an alternating current is induced in the antenna, extracting 
energy from the magnetic field.
Generally, the larger the diameter (and circumference) of the tag’s antenna loop, 
the more magnetic flux lines will be passing through the coil, therefore increasing 
the transfer of energy from the reader to the tag.
Loop antennas can be divided in three groups:
1.	 Half-wave antennas;
2.	 Full-wave antennas;
3.	 Series-loaded, short loop antennas.
where wave refers to the approximate circumference of the loop. 
The half-wave loop consists of a loop approximately one-half wavelength in 
circumference with a gap cut in the ring. It is very similar to a half-wave dipole that 
has been folded into a ring, and most of the information about the dipole applies to 
the half-wave loop. Because the ends are very close together, some capacitive load-
ing exists, and resonance is obtained at a somewhat smaller circumference than 
expected. The feedpoint impedance is also somewhat lower than the usual dipole, 
but all the usual feeding techniques can be applied to the half-wave loop. 
By increasing the capacitive loading across the gap, the loop can be made much 
smaller than one-half wavelength. At heavy loading, the loop closely resembles a 
single winding, LC-tuned circuit. The actual shape of the loop is not critical, and 
typically, the efficiency is determined by the area enclosed by the loop. The half-
wave loop is popular at lower frequencies, but at higher frequencies, the tuning 
capacitance across the gap becomes very small and critical.

166 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
As the name implies, the full-wave loop is approximately one wavelength in 
circumference. Resonance is obtained when the loop is slightly longer than one 
wavelength. The full-wave loop can be thought of as two end-connected dipoles. 
Like the half-wave loop, the shape of the full wave loop is not critical, but effi-
ciency is determined mainly by the enclosed area. The feed impedance is somewhat 
higher (approximately 120Ω) than the half-wave loop. 
Loading of the full-wave loop is accomplished by inserting small coils or hair-
pins in the loop, which reduces the size. Like the dipole and half-wave loop, numer-
ous impedance-matching methods exist, including gamma matching and tapering 
across a loading coil or hairpin. The main advantage of the full-wave loop is it does 
not have the air gap in the loop, which is very sensitive to load and PCB capaci-
tance spread.
Loaded-loop antennas are commonly used in remote control and remote key-
less entry (RKE) applications. The loop is placed in series with an inductor, which 
reduces efficiency of the antenna but shortens the physical length.
5.3.8.3  UHF Antennas
A typical inductively coupled feeding structure is shown in Figure 5.16(a) where 
antenna consists of a feeding loop and a radiating body. Two terminals of the loop 
are connected to the chip, and the feed is combined with the antenna body with 
mutual coupling. For example, if the measured impedance of the selected IC is 73-
j113, the load antenna impedance should be 73+j113 for conjugate matching. To 
achieve this, the proposed antenna structure is shown in Figure 5.16(b), with the 
dipole arms bent into arc shape [7].
Another way to achieve high resistance with inductively coupled feeding struc-
ture is to introduce extra radiating elements. A dual-body configuration is pre-
sented in Figure 5.16(c). Two meandering line arms are placed in each side of the 
feeding loop. The slight decrease of mutual coupling is due to the shorter coupling 
length. However, strong mutual coupling is now introduced between the two ra-
diating bodies, which can be similarly regarded as in a parallel connection seen 
from the feeding loop. In this way, resistance of the radiating body is significantly 
reduced, resulting in high resistance with meandering line arms. 
This antenna can be easily tuned by trimming. Lengths of meander trace and 
loading bar can be varied to obtain optimum reactance and resistance matching. 
The trimming is realized by punching holes through the antenna trace at defined 
locations. Such a tunable design is desirable when a solution is needed for a par-
ticular application with a minimum lead time.
5.3.8.4  Fractal Antennas
Short reading distances and the fact that the cost per tag is still too high are the ma-
jor reasons that passive RFID systems have not made their breakthrough yet. One 
key to increase reading distances is the tag antenna improvement. Because a passive 
tag does not have its own power supply, it is important that the tag antenna is able 
to absorb as much of the energy, radiated from the reader, as possible. 
Another important thing is to minimize the size of the tags. Small tags and 
hence small-tag antennas will expand the applicable areas of RFIDs. The challenge 

5.3  Tags 
167
is that small, effective antennas are in general poor radiators. A factor that affects 
the size of the tags is the frequency that is used. Different frequency bands are al-
located for RFID, and these bands differ in different regions of the world. From an 
economic point of view it is highly desirable to be able to use only one type of tag 
in all of the different regions.
In the study of antennas, fractal antenna theory is a relatively new area. How-
ever, fractal antennas and its superset fractal electrodynamics are a hotbed of re-
search activity these days. Fractals are geometrical shapes, which are self-similar, 
repeating themselves at different scales [8]. Many mathematical structures that are 
fractals, for example, Sierpinski’s gasket, Cantor’s comb, von Koch’s snowflake, 
the Mandelbrot set7, and the Lorenz attractor. Fractals also describe many real-
world objects that do not correspond to simple geometric shapes, for example, 
clouds, mountains, turbulence, and coastlines [9]. 
Fractal antennas do not have any characteristic size; fractal structures with a 
self-similar geometric shape consisting of multiple copies of themselves on many 
different scales have the potential to be frequency-independent or at least multi-
frequency antennas. For example, it has been shown that a bow-tie antenna can 
operate efficiently over different frequencies and that the bands can be chosen by 
modifying the structure. Examples of wideband antennas are the classical spiral 
7.	
The terms fractal and fractal dimension are due to Mandelbrot, who is the person most often associated 
with the mathematics of fractals [9]. The term fractal means linguistically “broken” or “fractured” from 
the Latin fractus.

antennas and the classical log-periodic antennas, which can also be classified as 
fractal antennas. 
Fractal antennas are convoluted, uneven shapes, and sharp edges, corners, and 
discontinuities tend to enhance radiation of electromagnetic energy from electric 
systems. Fractal antennas, therefore, have the potential to be efficient. This is par-
ticularly important when small antennas are to be designed, because small anten-
nas are not generally good at radiating electromagnetic energy. 
Some fractals have the property that they can be very long, but still fit in to a 
certain volume or area. Because fractals do not have a dimension that is an integer, 
they can more effectively fill a given volume or area at deposal. Small antennas 
generally have a very small input resistance and a very significant negative input 
reactance, meaning that they are poor radiators. It has been shown that many small 
fractal antennas have greater input resistance and smaller input reactance than 
small traditional antennas. 
Also, the Q factor of small antennas depends on how effectively the antenna 
occupies a certain radian sphere. Small fractal antennas can thus be expected to 
have lower Q factors than their regular counterparts and, hence, higher bandwidth.
Small input resistance and large input reactance also means that it is difficult 
and expensive to match the antenna input impedance with a matching network. 
It has been shown that many fractal antennas can even resonate with a size much 
smaller than the regular ones. Hence, it is possible to reduce or even eliminate the 
cost associated with input impedance matching. 
By shaping antennas in certain ways, the directivity can be improved. Fractal 
antennas are shaped antennas. In some RFID applications in which the tag orien-
tation can be controlled, it is possible that antennas with high directivity are pre-
ferred to achieve long reading distances and/or to avoid problems associated with 
scanning several tags simultaneously. It is also possible that in some applications a 
small handheld reader with a high directivity antenna is desirable.
Because frequency-independent antennas and wideband antennas tend to be in-
sensitive to deformations like cutting in the structure and bending of the structure, 
one might expect some fractal antennas to be resistant against deformations too. 
5.3.9  UHF Tags Circuits
5.3.9.1  Tag dc Supply Voltage Circuitry
The voltage multiplier converts a part of the incoming RF signal power to dc for 
power supply for all active circuits on the chip (Figure 5.17). The specially designed 
Schottky diodes with low series resistance allow for a high-efficiency conversion of 
the received RF input signal energy to dc supply voltage.
The voltage multiplier circuit shown here is sometimes also called charge pump 
in the context of memory ICs. A charge pump is a circuit that when given an ac 
input, is able to output a dc voltage typically larger than a simple rectifier would 
generate. It can be thought of as an ac-to-dc converter that both rectifies the ac 
signal and increases the dc level. It is the foundation of power converters such as 
the ones that are used for many electronic devices today. 

5.3  Tags 
169
In this case, for the RF signal, all the diodes are connected in parallel (or anti-
parallel) by the capacitors. For dc, however, they are connected in series to allow a 
dc current flowing between terminals. The voltage generated between these nodes 
is approximately equal to: 
	
(
)
DD
RF
D
V
n V
V
=
-
	
(5.43)
where n is the number of diodes, VRF is the amplitude of the RF input signal, and 
VD is the forward voltage of the Schottky diodes (approximately 200 mV at 7 μA).
The input impedance is mainly determined by the junction and substrate ca-
pacitances of the Schottky diodes. The real part of the impedance is much lower 
than the imaginary part and is strongly dependent on the dc current taken from the 
output. For a typical operating point, the real part of the impedance is approxi-
mately 30 times lower than the imaginary (capacitive) part. In other words, the IC’s 
input capacitance has a quality factor of 30, placing high demands on the antenna, 
which needs to be matched to the IC’s input impedance for sufficiently good power 
efficiency. 
The design parameters of the voltage multiplier are a trade-off between power 
efficiency, useful impedance, and operating point (load). Optimization parameters 
include the number of stages, the size of the Schottky diodes, and the size of cou-
pling capacitors.
5.3.9.2  Tag Wake-Up Circuit Principles
The interrogation of active RFID tags will inevitably involve the development of a 
mechanism for turning on the tags. The power conservation is an important factor 
that requires the tags to be turned off when not being interrogated. This will also 
be true for active sensors and sensor networks [10]. There are two practical options 
for turn-on circuits design:

Components of the RFID System
•• Rectifier circuits that can produce, from the RF field, a rectified voltage of 
the order of 1V, which will turn a CMOS transistor from fully off to fully on;
•• Rectifier circuits that can produce, from the RF field, a rectified voltage of 
the order of 5 mV, which when compared to an internal reference voltage can 
be used to trigger a transistor from fully off to the fully on state.
Schottky diodes have been proven to perform very well in microwave networks 
for many years because of their excellent high-frequency behavior. For microwave 
applications, these Schottky diodes are usually fabricated in specialized processes 
where barrier heights, capacitances, and other parameters can be fully controlled. 
The RFID applications demand low-cost solution, therefore requiring the standard 
CMOS processes. However, the problem is that most of the standard CMOS pro-
cesses do not support the Schottky diode, so the processes has to be modified in 
order to incorporate the Schottky diodes. 
A Schottky junction is relatively delicate and sensitive to excessive RF power, 
and RFID applications may work in poorly controlled environments where high 
power may cause the diode to burn out. Hence, in an application it is important to 
use power limiters to protect the sensitive Schottky diode.
The battery powering active transponders must last for an acceptable time, so 
the electronics of the label must have very low current consumption in order to 
prolong the life of the battery. However, due to circuit complexity or the desired 
operating range, the electronics may drain the battery more rapidly than desired, 
so the use of a turn-on circuit allows the battery to be connected only when com-
munication is needed, thus lengthening the life of the battery. The circuit shown in 
Figure 5.18 is adequate and cost-effective for a backscattering active tag. 
Here, a p-channel FET was used as a switch to control the power supply to a 
label control circuits and can be triggered by the incident 915-MHz radiation on 
the antenna. Thus, the power generated and amplified by the diode resonance can 
be utilized to turn a p-channel FET from an off state to an on state. The turn-on

circuit performs adequately at a minimum power of –43 dBW at the resonant fre-
quency of the 915 MHz. 
5.3.10  Tag Manufacturing Process
The major processes involved in the manufacturing of RFID tags are antenna pro-
duction process and chip assembly. Both of these activities have gone through heavy 
development in the last few years with the purpose of increasing the throughput and 
reducing the final cost of the tag. 
5.3.10.1  Antenna Production Process
The most popular processes currently on the market for the production of bidimen-
sional antennas are chemical etching and conductive ink printing [11]. 
Chemical etching is an established technology used for the realization of print-
ed electronic circuit boards. To reach the necessary volume requirement, the tech-
nology has been modified adopting a roll-to-roll process where copper tape roll, 
typically 20 to 40 microns thick, is glued to a polymeric roll substrate, typically 
PET (polyethylene terphthalate is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester 
family). The copper film is then masked with a photoresist mask and inserted in 
a chemical bath where the exposed copper is chemically attacked and removed, 
thereby creating the desired pattern. The photoresist mask is then removed using a 
standard process. 
The strongest advantage of this process, originally invented for the develop-
ment of flexible circuits, is its availability and well-known manufacturing cost pa-
rameters. The currently estimated cost for copper etching is $10 per square meter 
of produced material that, for 600 antennas per square meter, is equivalent to 1.6 
cents per antenna.
Conductive ink printing is the process based on flexographic equipment, in 
which the antennas can be printed on a polymer roll in a single step with no need 
for masking. The major problem with this technology is the inherent cost of the 
material used in the process, usually a conductive ink loaded with 30% (or more) 
of silver flake particles, and the higher surface resistivity of the conductive layer, a 
feature inversely proportional to the final performance of the antenna. 
Another concern is the inherent environmental impact of using silver; as RFID 
tags are used and disposed of, their increasing density within landfills around the 
world will eventually jeopardize ground water supplies, leading to requirements for 
recycling as is presently done for electronics.
5.3.10.2  Chip Assembly
The major challenge in assembling the active component onto the antenna circuit 
is represented by the small size of the chip itself, the need for low temperature at-
tachment and the required throughput capacity. Chips for passive RFID tags had 
their size reduced to submillimeter dimensions in order to optimize the cost of the 
component, thus increasing the number of chips per wafer. 
This, of course, creates technical problems when the chip, whose pads are now 
below the 100-µm size, needs to be connected to the antenna at high speed. To 

172 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
overcome this problem, Pick-and-Place (PnP) equipment manufacturers have devel-
oped innovative technology enabling the attachment of the chip to the antenna roll 
using standard flip-chip technology and dispensing fast curing conductive adhesive 
at high speed. The process is quite simple and is capable of attaching about 10,000 
components per hour, equivalent to about 70 million tags per year. 
Some tag manufacturers have approached the problem from a different point 
of view, focusing their attention on the production capacity and thus purposefully 
adopting another process, the strap attach. In this solution, the chip is attached to 
a polymeric carrier film in roll form at high density and high velocity using roll-to-
roll equipment.
This polymeric carrier has previously been prepared with small caves on the 
surface to receive the chip, which corresponds to large conductive pads. Proper 
geometry of the cave and chip die guarantees the proper positioning of the chip on 
the film. Once this step is completed, it is possible to couple the roll containing the 
straps with the roll containing the antennas and accomplish the final assembly by 
using dispensed adhesive. Of course, due to the different density and location of 
the chip on the strap carrier, each strap needs to be singulated before attachment. 
The advantage of this process, as stated by its major supporters, is the possibil-
ity to assemble chips at a very high velocity. The disadvantage is that the process 
consists of two-step phases and that the singulation of the strap causes in some way 
a reduction in the speed of the process. While it is possible to load the straps at very 
high speed, the final assembly of the strap on the antenna is still a process regulated 
in its throughput by the curing of the adhesive used for attachment.
5.4  Readers
5.4.1  Principles of Operation
RFID tags are interrogated by readers, which, in turn, are connected to a host com-
puter. In a passive system, the RFID reader transmits an energy field that wakes up 
the tag and powers its chip, enabling it to transmit or store data. Active tags may 
periodically transmit a signal, much like a lighthouse beacon, so that data may be 
captured by multiple readers distributed throughout a facility. 
The reader is equipped with antennas for sending and receiving signals, a trans-
ceiver and a processor to decode data. Companies may need many readers to cover 
all their factories, warehouses, and stores. Readers typically operate at one radio 
frequency, so if tags from three different manufacturers used three different fre-
quencies, a retailer might have to have multiple readers in some locations, increas-
ing the cost further. 
Readers may be portable handheld terminals, or fixed devices positioned at 
strategic points, such as a store entrance, assembly line or toll booth (gate readers.) 
In addition, readers/interrogators could also be mobile. 
Fixed readers are designed for large scale deployments that need to process 
a large volume of assets at certain points and primary read zones, such as dock 
doors. Permanently installed in a defined location, these devices are constantly 
reading and always listening in order to detect any RFID tag that passes within the 
reader’s active zone.

5.4  Readers 
173
Handheld or portable readers are a very useful resource to supplement fixed 
readers. Handheld readers can be used instead of a portal reader to record boxes 
loaded and identify boxes as they are removed; little efficiency is gained relative 
to bar-coded labels, but customer mandates can be accommodated with minimal 
initial expense. 
Handheld readers are also very useful for exception handling of boxes that fail 
to read at a portal or on a conveyor or that have misplaced or misoriented labels 
identifying boxes of unknown provenance, and so forth. Handheld readers can be 
useful for inventory cycle count in storage areas or temporary staging locations, for 
locating specific cartons in storage, for verifying manifests during assembly, and for 
specialized applications such as tail-to-tail baggage transfer (moving baggage from 
one airplane to another in an airport without routing it through the terminal).
The newest category of RFID readers are the mobile RFID readers. This ca-
ble-free device is completely self-contained, with integrated battery, antennas, and 
wireless communications capabilities. The mobile RFID reader can be used on ma-
terial handling equipment, such as forklifts, clamp trucks and skate wheels or on 
other moving equipment like mobile carts. It can also be installed as a stationery 
device in hard to cable areas. Where the fixed RFID reader requires product to be 
brought to the reader, mobile readers are brought to the product—like the hand-
held RFID reader. However, while the handheld reader requires user intervention to 
read, the mobile RFID reader offers hands-free operation. 
RFID readers are used to activate passive tags with RF energy and to extract 
information from the tag. For this function, the reader includes RF transmission, 
receiving, and data decoding sections. In addition, the reader often includes a serial 
communication (RS-232, USB, and so on) capability to communicate with a host 
computer. Depending on the complexity and purpose of applications, the reader’s 
price range can vary from tens to thousands of dollars’ worth of components and 
packaging. Typically, the reader is a read-only device, while the reader for a read-
and-write device is often called interrogator. Unlike the reader for a read-only de-
vice, the interrogator uses command pulses to communicate with a tag for reading 
and writing data.
The carrier is the transmitted radio signal of the reader (interrogator). This 
RF carrier provides energy to the tag device and is used to detect modulation data 
from the tag using a backscattering. In read/write devices, the carrier is also used to 
deliver the interrogator’s commands and data to the tag.
The RF transmission section includes an RF carrier generator, an antenna, and 
a tuning circuit. The antenna and its tuning circuit must be properly designed and 
tuned for the best performance. Data decoding for the received signal is accom-
plished using a microcontroller. The firmware algorithm in the microcontroller is 
written in such a way to transmit the RF signal, decode the incoming data, and 
communicate with the host computer.
The main criteria for readers include the following:
•• Operating frequency: They could be LF, HF, UHF, and some companies are 
starting to develop multifrequency readers;
•• Protocol agility: support for different tag protocols (ISO, EPC, proprietary);

Certain readers also provide connection options to enable simple process con-
trol mechanisms to be implemented, such as digital inputs and outputs with 24V, 
which can be used to control traffic lights or gates that are released once the tag 
data has been checked at the goods issue/receipt point. 
Simple PLC couplings can also be realized using this technology. The higher 
protocol layers have not been standardized yet, resulting in additional time and 
effort when it comes to integrating readers across different manufacturers. In ad-
dition, readers and antennas at loading gates must be highly tolerant as regards 
temperature and must be protected against dust and damp. 
Up until the recent surge in developments for the supply chain and EPC tags, 
readers were mainly used in access control systems and other low-volume RFID 
applications, which meant that the problem of treating very large numbers of tags 
and high volumes of data was not such a serious issue. This is all changing, and 
many reader manufacturers are developing next generation products to handle 
the application problems that will be specific to the supply chain and EPC/ISO 
infrastructure.
5.4.2  Reader Antenna
The reader antenna establishes a connection between the reader electronics and 
the electromagnetic wave in the space. In the HF range, the reader antenna is a coil 
(like the tag antenna) designed to produce as strong a coupling as possible with the 
tag antenna. 

5.4  Readers 
175
In the UHF range, reader antennas (like tag antennas) come in a variety of 
designs. Highly directional, high-gain antennas are used for large read distances. 
Regulatory authorities usually limit the maximum power emitted in a given direc-
tion; as a result, the transmission power emitted from the reader to the antenna 
must also be regulated accordingly. One advantage of highly directional antennas 
is that the reader power often has to be emitted only to the spaces in which the tags 
that are to read are located.
Generally speaking, physical interdependencies mean that the antenna gain is 
linked to the antenna size. The higher the gain (or the smaller the solid angle into 
which the antenna emits), the larger the mechanical design of the antenna will be. 
It follows, therefore, that highly directional antennas are not used for handheld 
readers. Antennas typically used for handheld readers include patch antennas, half-
wave dipoles, and helix antennas. Larger antenna structures can be used for sta-
tionary readers; in the UHF range, they usually take the form of arrays. 
All other things being equal, a high-gain antenna will transmit and receive 
weaker signals farther than a low-gain antenna. Omnidirectional antennas, such 
as dipole antennas, will have lower gain than directional antennas because they 
distribute their power over a wider area. Parabolic antennas usually have the high-
est gain of any type of antenna but not really useable in typical RFID applications, 
except maybe for microwave RFID readers where a long-range and narrow radia-
tion pattern is required. A half-wave dipole antenna will have a gain of near unity 
or nearly equal the isotropic antenna.
Reader antennas may have different requirements depending on whether they 
are fixed, portable, or mobile readers. For example, selection of antennas for por-
table devices is dominated by size and weight constraints. Read range and polariza-
tion are generally less significant than in the case of fixed readers. Efficient use of 
RF power to maximize battery life is critical. Highly directive antennas are useful 
to reduce power consumption, but are generally physically large and thus may not 
fit portable applications. The fact that handheld reader antennas are small and 
light constrains the antenna gain.
Antennas that are less than about one-quarter of a wavelength in all dimen-
sions (a quarter-wave is about 80 mm or 3.2 inches for UHF operation in the 
United States) cannot achieve more than about 4 dBi of gain. Slightly larger an-
tennas allow up to about 6 dBi of gain, but make the reader somewhat bulky and 
awkward to carry. The trade-off is important because handheld and portable ap-
plications benefit from high antenna gain.
The reader is likely to employ less than the maximum allowed transmitting 
power to improve battery life, so read range is impacted if antenna gain is low. A 
narrow antenna beam will improve the ability of the user to locate the tag being 
read by changing the reader orientation and noting the results. The narrow beam 
of a high-gain antenna, which is undesirable in a stationary-reader application, is 
often beneficial for a handheld reader, since the user can readily move the beam to 
cover the area of interest.
5.4.3  Software Defined Radios in RFID Systems
The problem of continuous change in the EPC market is a vitally important for all 
RFID users and especially those responsible for buying and installing RFID reader 

176 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
infrastructure. While tags are the consumables of the RFID systems, constantly 
varying, iterating and regenerating, the RFID reader infrastructure is a deployed 
capital expense that cannot easily or cost-effectively be replaced every time a new 
tag variant appears. All this change is good for the RFID user as it will deliver ever-
improving performance, and decreasing costs. 
Software-defined radio (SDR) uses software for the modulation and demodula-
tion of radio signals. In other words, SDR is a radio communication system where 
components that have been typically implemented in hardware (mixers, filters, am-
plifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, and so on) are instead implemented 
by means of software. 
An SDR performs the majority of its signal processing in the digital domain, 
most commonly in a digital signal processor (DSP), which is a type of micropro-
cessor specifically optimized for signal processing functions. The advantage of an 
SDR-based RFID reader is that it can receive and transmit a new form of RFID  
communication protocol simply by running new software on existing SDR 
hardware.
A software-defined RFID reader consists of an RF analog front end that con-
verts RF signals to and from the reader’s antennas into an analog baseband or in-
termediate frequency signal, and analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog 
converters that are used to convert these signals to and from a digital representation 
that can be processed in software running on the reader’s digital signal processor. 
SDR technology has long been important in the military context, where new 
radio equipment must interoperate with legacy equipment, much of which is used 
for many years beyond its design lifetime. Additionally, the U.S. military is often 
called upon to work together with allies that have old, outdated equipment that is 
incompatible with the more modern U.S. communication hardware. This is exactly 
analogous to the Generation 1 to Generation 2 (and beyond) transition in RFID. 
Military SDR projects date back to the early 1990s, and several were fielded in that 
time frame. Aware of these developments, in 1999 the MIT Auto-ID Center began 
exploring the idea of using SDR in RFID readers. 
5.4.4  Data Transfer Between a Tag and a Reader 
5.4.4.1  Signal Transmission
For a RFID system to work, three processes are required: energy transfer, downlink, 
and uplink. According to this we can divide RFID systems into three groups, full-
duplex, half-duplex, and sequential. 
During full-duplex and half-duplex operation, the energy is transferred con-
stantly, compared to sequential when energy is first transferred by the reader and 
then the tag responds. 
In half-duplex systems the information is sent in turns either transferred induc-
tively through load modulation or as electromagnetic backscatter. In full-duplex 
systems uplink information is sent on a separate frequency, either a subharmonic 
or not, so the flow of information can be bidirectional and continuous.
Sequential transfer consists of two phases: first, energy is sent to the tag that 
stores it in a capacitor, and then, utilizing the power received, it can function for 
some time and send its reply. This method has the advantage; by extending the 

5.4  Readers 
177
charging time and enlarging the capacitor, it is possible to accumulate more energy 
for the electronics.
5.4.4.2  Data Transfer Rate
A further influence of carrier frequency is with respect to data transfer, for which it 
is very important is to understand bit rate (data rate) concept. 
Whereas in theory it is possible to transfer binary data at twice the carrier 
frequency, in practice it is usual to use many cycles of carrier to represent a binary 
digit or group of digits. However, in general terms, the higher the carrier frequency 
the higher the rate for data transfer that can be achieved. So, a low-frequency sys-
tem operating at 125 kHz may transfer data at a rate of between 200 bps and 4,000 
bps, depending upon the type of system. Rates up to greater than 100 kbps (but 
typically less than 1 Mbps) for are possible for microwave systems. 
It should also be appreciated that a finite bandwidth is required in practice to 
transfer data, this being a consequence of the modulation that is used. Consequen-
tial to transfer capability is the data capacity of the tag. Loosely speaking, the lower 
the frequency, the lower the data capacity of the tags, simply because of the data 
required to be transferred in a defined time period. Keep in mind that the capacity 
can also be determined by the manner in which the tag is designed to be read or 
written to (for read/write tags). 
The choice of data transfer rate has to be considered in relation to system trans-
fer requirements; this is determined by the maximum number of tags that may be 
expected to be read in a unit interval of time multiplied by the amount of data that 
is required to be read from each tag. Where a write function is also involved, the 
number of tags and write requirements must also be considered. 
ISO 15693 is an ISO standard for vicinity cards, that is, cards that can be read 
from a greater distance as compared to proximity cards. ISO 15693 systems oper-
ate at the 13.56-MHz frequency, and offer maximum read distance of 3 to 4 feet. 
In ISO 15693 chips, the subcarrier frequency is equal to 423.75 kHz (RF/32) with 
FSK or OOK modulation and Manchester data coding. The achievable label data 
transfer rate is up to a relatively fast 26.48 kbps. Most typical bit rate values in bps 
are RF/8, RF/16, RF/32, RF/40, RF/50, RF/64, RF/80, RF/100, and RF/128. 
Every tag sends back information with some predefined, usually fixed bit rate, 
and once the manufacturer programs the data rate, it usually cannot be changed. 
This data rate is clocked by internal tag frequency. For LF transponders the range 
is from 100 to 150 kHz, depending on the manufacturer. 
Consider, for example, transponder type that bit rate is RF/32. It means that 
data rate is 32 field clocks (FC) per logic 1 or 0 data bit. Data (bit) rate is a bit 
time duration and it is defined as field clocks per bit. Taking field clock equal to 
125 kHz and tag bit rate equal to RF/32, data rate is 125 kHz/32 =3.9062 kbps, so 
receiving 64 bits of information would take 8 µs × 32 × 64 = 16.384 ms.
The manner in which the tags are interrogated is also important. It can be done 
by singulation (one at a time in the interrogation zone) or as a batch (a number of 
tags in the interrogation zone at the same time). The latter requires that the tags 
and associated system has anticontention (or anticollision) capabilities so that col-
lisions between responses from tags in the zone at the same time can be resolved 
and contention avoided. Various anticontention protocols have been devised and 

178 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
applied with various levels of performance in respect of the number of tags that 
can be handled and the time required handling them. So, the anticontention perfor-
mance may be an important consideration in many applications.
5.4.4.3  Read/Write Range
The read/write range is the communication distance between the reader (interroga-
tor) and tag. Specifically, the read range is the maximum distance to read data out 
from the tag and the write range is the maximum distance to write data from inter-
rogator to the tag. 
The read/write range is, among other effects, mainly related to:
•• Electromagnetic coupling of the reader (interrogator) and tag antennas;
•• The RF output power level of reader (interrogator);
•• Carrier frequency bands;
•• The power consumption of the device;
•• Antenna orientation;
•• The distance between the interrogator and the tag;
•• Operating�������������������������������������������������������������������

 conditions (������������������������������������������

 noise, multiple tags, mul-
tiple readers, and so on);
•• The tag and the tag’s dwell time.
The tag’s dwell time is the time a tag is in the interrogator’s RF field. An RFID 
interrogator’s read range is the distance between the interrogator and the RFID tag 
at which the signals from the tag can be read properly. Similarly, an RFID inter-
rogator’s write range is the maximum distance at which information within the 
RF signal from the interrogator can be received correctly and stored within the 
memory of the tag’s microchip. 
More power is needed to write to a tag than to read it; as a result, the tags need 
to be closer to the antenna to write than to read. The general rule is that the write 
range is 50% to 70% of the read range of a particular interrogation zone.
Power limitations, as listed in Table 5.3, are imposed by local authority and 
cannot be chosen arbitrarily. The standardization of RFID technology, as well as 
the requirements of the local governing bodies are still in progress and change 
constantly. For that reason, some of the information provided in this book that 
was correct during the preparation of the manuscript might change by the time it 
reaches the reader.
The electromagnetic coupling of the reader and tag antennas increases using a 
similar size of antenna with high Q on both sides. The read range is improved by 
increasing the carrier frequency. This is due to the gain in the radiation efficiency 
of the antenna as the frequency increases. However, the disadvantage of a high-
frequency (900-MHz to 2.4-GHz) application is shallow skin depth and narrow-
er antenna beamwidth, causing less penetration and more directional problems, 
respectively. 
Low-frequency application, on the other hand, has an advantage in the pene-
tration and directivity, but a disadvantage in the antenna performance. Read range 

5.4  Readers 
179
increases by reducing the current consumption in the silicon device. This is because 
the LC antenna circuit couples less energy from the reader at further distances. A 
lower power device can make use of less energy for the operation.
For LF and HF (near-field) systems, to increase the magnetic field at the tag’s 
position, the reader/writer antenna coil’s radius must be increased, or the current 
in the antenna coil must be increased, or both. The strength of the magnetic field 
attenuated in proportion to the inverse of the cube of distance. By increasing the 
diameter of the RFID tag’s antenna coil, the signal induced in the tag’s coil could 
be increased. 
Accordingly, for applications that require long-range operation, the reader/
writer antenna coil’s radius and tag antenna coil’s dimensions must be increased. 
The primary goal is to design an antenna that maximizes RFID read range. In tests 
comparing coin-sized and IC card-sized tags using the same reader/writer, the IC 
card-sized tag had an operating range several times larger than the coin-sized tag.
The read range of UHF-based RFID (propagation) system can be calculated by 
the Friis free space equation as follows:

where GT is the gain of the tag antenna, PRGR is an EIRP of the reader, λ is the 
wavelength, Pth is the minimum threshold power required to power an RFID tag, θ 
is the angle made by the tag with the reader plane, and (Δρ)2 is the power reflection 
coefficient, which is the ratio of reflected power to incident power by the tag. Factor 
1 - (Dr)2 is also called mismatch factor.
Note that the power received by the tag is inversely proportional to the square 
of the distance between the tag and the reader’s antenna. Studies reveal that the 
orientation of tag in the RF field affects its read range. In the specific context of a

work is still underway to further alleviate European regulatory constraints.

Components of the RFID System
directivity pattern, a perfectly parallel tag, relative to the reader’s antenna, yields 
maximum read range, while a tag perpendicular to the base station antenna’s field 
has minimum to zero read range. Thus, efforts are made to make the tag parallel to 
the reader antenna by deploying one or more of the following measures:
•• Change in orientation of the reader antenna to suit the orientation of the tag 
antenna;
•• Use of redundant antennas for ensuring proper alignment of at least one 
reader antenna to the tag antenna;
•• Increase reader antenna power (of course, within the limits allowed by the 
local authorities) to reduce the effect of tag orientation;
•• Increase the polling rate of the antenna to make more reads in the same sam-
pling time.
The far-field formula is correct, assuming that polarization of reader antenna 
and the polarization of tag antenna are perfectly matched. However, in fact, the 
polarization mismatch is essential and required in most RFID applications. The 
point is that in the majority of applications the tag is allowed to appear in almost 
arbitrary position in the field of the reader antenna while the polarization of the tag 
antenna is usually linear because of required small size of the tag. 
In such situation, the only way to fulfill a system requirement is to use circular-
ly polarized reader antenna. Thus, a sacrifice of 3-dB power loss (at least, although 
it can be even much higher, see the discussion on polarization mismatch in Chapter 
2) due to polarization mismatch between circularly polarized reader antenna and 
linearly polarized tag antenna overcomes the problem of tag orientation. This is 
why, nowadays, the major vendors offer mainly circularly polarized reader anten-
nas (except for the handheld readers). 
At the same time, the linearly polarized antennas are also available in the mar-
ket for limited RFID applications. In the case of linearly polarized both reader and 
tag antennas, the substantial polarization misalignment may cause severe power 
loss. In the case of circular-to-linear polarization mismatch, the read range, r, will 
be 
2  times shorter than the one calculated by (5.43).
As we can see from the Table 5.4, systems operating in the 915-MHz band may 
achieve read ranges of 20 feet (6m) or more under current FCC regulations.
5.4.4.4  Environment and Proximity to Other Objects
Up to now, our considerations have focused upon data transfer across an unclut-
tered air interface. However, free-space propagation where reader and tag are dis-
tanced from any obstructions or other tags, and perfectly aligned relative to each 
other, is not a realistic situation. In practice, the region between the tag and inter-
rogator may contain obstacles and materials that can influence the performance of 
the system. 
The carrier frequency is one of significance with respect to the effects that the 
prevailing conditions and clutter factors (obstacles and physical structures) can 
have. In low- and high-frequency inductive RFID systems, the magnetic field is ef-
fectively used to couple data, and such fields are largely unaffected by dielectric or

Components of the RFID System
insulator materials (papers, plastics, masonry, and ceramics, for example); the field 
simply penetrates the materials. 
Metals, on the other hand, can distort the field, depending upon how ferrous 
they are. This will weaken the field strength in regions of the interrogation zone, 
in some cases to the extent that the system performance is impaired. The range 
capability may be impaired or ability to read or write to a tag may be impaired. 
For uncompensated tag designs operating at resonant frequencies, the presence of 
metals can often detune the device, in some cases preventing it to operate.
At higher frequencies (UHF and above), for propagation RFID, the electric 
component of field becomes more significant. The higher the frequency, the more 
easily they can penetrate dielectric materials. However, for some materials where 
energy exchange mechanisms can be identified at or near the carrier frequency, 
this can result in energy absorption from the propagating wave, hence causing an 
impairment of range performance. 
One of the challenges with UHF RFID tags is working well in the presence of 
water or metal. Unfortunately, the human body is made up of mostly water. Thus, 
if the RFID tag is placed close to (or implanted inside) the human body, perfor-
mance will suffer.
As far as metals are concerned, they reflect or scatter higher-frequency signals, 
depending on the size of the metal object in relation to the wavelength of the in-
cident signal. Such effects can impair the range that can be achieved and, in some 
cases, can screen the reader from the tag and prevent it from being read. Any metal 
near the tag, such as keys or coins, may also cause the tag to be undetectable.
The proximity of tags may also exhibit a similar effect. Reflections and diffrac-
tion effects can often allow pathways around metal objects within an interrogation 
zone. Because it is difficult to generalize on the effects of clutter within the inter-
rogation zone, it is expedient where possible to avoid clutter and choose a carrier 
frequency that is appropriate to the conditions to be expected. 
Passive RF tags in the UHF and microwave bands have drawn considerable 
attention because of their great potential for use in many RFID applications [12]. 
However, more basic research is needed to increase the range and reliability of a 
passive RF tag’s radio link, particularly when the RF tag is placed onto any lossy 
dielectric or metallic surface. This radio link budget is dependent upon the gain 
penalty losses (LGP), a term which quantifies the reduction in RF tag antenna gain 
due to material attachment.

The assumption in this case is that the gain of the reader’s transmit and receive 
antennas are the same, which may not always be the case; the reason is that the 
single-antenna readers are inexpensive and compact but need excellent matching 
circuits, high-isolation coupler with extremely high isolation between ports, and 
electronic circuitry with wide dynamic range. 
In the logarithmic form, the same expression for the backscattered power re-
ceived at the reader looks much simpler:

A series of measurements was used to measure the far-field gain pattern, and 
gain penalty of several flexible 915-MHz antennas when attached to cardboard, 
pine plywood, acrylic, deionized water, ethylene glycol, ground beef, and an alumi-
num slab. It is shown that the gain penalty due to material attachment can result in 
more than 20 dB of excess loss in the backscatter communication link.
From the reader’s prospective, handheld and portable antennas are very likely 
to operate in proximity to people’s hands and arms, as well as other obstacles. The 
amount of power reflected from the antenna, measured by its reflection coefficient 
or return loss, should ideally be unaffected by such obstacles unless they are actu-
ally within the antenna beam. 
The best return loss performance in presence of near-field objects is usually 
obtained from balanced antennas, in which the two halves of an antenna are driven 
by precisely opposed currents, and there is no large ground plane. However, such 
antennas are relatively large compared to single-ended (nonbalanced) antennas and 
require a balanced-unbalanced transformer (balun) to connect them to ground-
referenced antenna cables or circuit board connectors. With a balun, the antenna is 
less sensitive to the presence of near-field objects.
5.4.5  UHF Reader Electronic Circuitry
To shrink the size of the RF portion of an RFID reader, it is necessary to increase the 
functions in each element. Figure 5.19 shows a typical block diagram of an RFID 
reader and shows one possible way of integrating elements into a chipset. Each 
module will be briefly described in the following sections.
5.4.5.1  UHF Reader Source Module
The purpose of the source module is to provide a synthesized local oscillator (LO) 
for transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) paths in an RFID reader. The updated FCC 
standard requires frequencies to be within 10 ppm over the operating temperature 
ranges. It is necessary to amplify the signal after the synthesizer, in order to provide 
adequate LO input to the Tx and Rx signal paths due to typical synthesizer output 
powers and the loss of the power divider. 
For a source module, it is critical that a single PC board footprint can be used 
to handle all the different bands. Using an integrated synthesizer/voltage-controlled

oscillator (VCO) IC, it is possible to center the VCO bands by using different in-
ductor values. The Japanese band requires a faster switching speed than the U.S. 
and European bands, which can still be realized with a 5-kHz bandwidth loop 
filter, but with different component values. It is desirable to have isolation on the 
order of 20 dB in the power divider. 
For cost reasons, monolithic narrowband power dividers are generally used 
and are not optimal for covering 850 to 960 MHz. To optimize the isolation for 
each, tuning inductors and/or capacitors are used to recenter the power divider 
isolation. To shrink the size and reduce overall component count, it is necessary to 
combine somewhat diverse parts to create a source module. An additional require-
ment, that is typical of synthesizer/source modules, is that shielding is required for 
loop stability and minimization of phase noise.

5.4.5.2  UHF Reader Transmitting Module
As depicted in Figure 5.19, a typical transmitting module would include a double 
balanced modulator (DBM), LO amplifier, preamplifier, power amplifier, and im-
pedance transforming network (ITN). 
The high level of integration, with over 50 dB of available small signal gain, 
requires careful module layout. To maintain stability, it is necessary to keep the 
preamplifier located as far as possible from the power amplifier. The DBM pro-
vides a means to modulate the carrier signal. An LO amplifier is included to raise 
the signal available from the source module to a level sufficient to drive the mixers. 
Additionally, having the LO amplifier provide a 50Ω interface allows for simple 
interconnection to the source module. The modulated RF output from the mixer 
goes to a preamplifier and then to a power amplifier. The preamplifier has a gain 
of 17 dB and the power amplifier, implemented as a three-stage device, provides a 
small signal gain of 35 dB. 
The purpose of ITN is to transform the 50Ω load impedance to a level that the 
power amplifier needs to drive in order to produce the desired output power at the 
available supply voltage. For a typical supply of 3.6 V, this impedance is only a few 
ohms, creating large circulating currents. These low impedances necessitate proper 
handling of circuit parasitics. This circuit requires careful design and implementa-
tion from performance and reliability perspectives. 
To be able to provide the desired 1-W RF level at the antenna terminals typi-
cal for UHF readers, the power amplifier needs to be capable of providing suf-
ficient power output capability to overcome the signal losses introduced between 
the transmitting module output and the antenna. These losses would include any 
coupler, filter, circulator, connector, and cabling used in the path to the antenna. 
It is desirable to control the power in order to both set the output level to vari-
ous requirements and to implement a commonly used form of carrier amplitude 
modulation called a pulse-interval modulation, which is used to interrogate tags. 
The modulation bandwidth must be sufficient for the intended data rates without 
significant distortion, but as much circuitry as possible should be broadband.
The transmitter transmits encoding data with ASK modulation, including DSB-
ASK, and SSB-ASK for forward link, and send an unmodulated carrier for return 
link. The maximum output power from PA is restricted to 1 W (30 dBm).
5.4.5.3  UHF Reader Receiving Module
Most modern wireless communication systems use digital modulation/demodula-
tion techniques, and there is a good reason for this. They provide increased channel 
capacity and a greater accuracy in transmitted and received messages in the pres-
ence of noise and distortion. 
In digital communication systems, a finite number of electrical waveforms or 
symbols are transmitted, where each symbol can represent 1 or more bits. It is the 
job of the receiver to identify which symbol was sent by the transmitter even after 
the addition of noise and distortion. Distortion in wireless communication can 
be caused by several mechanisms, such as passing a signal through filters having 
insufficient bandwidth or inefficient switching of nonlinear elements. Ultimately, 

186 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
the effects of such events within communication systems are termed intersymbol 
interference (ISI). 
In addition to ISI, there are other types of distortion more notably termed delay 
spread and noise. Delay spread occurs when multiple versions of the same signal 
are received at different times. This occurs when the transmitted signal reflects off 
multiple objects on its way to the receiver (multipath). 
System designers are focusing their attention on their transceivers in search of 
a method or components that might help them achieve a superior signal-to-noise 
ratio, resulting in a lower bit-error rate (BER). It is widely projected that one of the 
reasons for the delay in a wide scale adoption of RFID systems has been the unac-
ceptable BER of RFID tag reading. 
In addition, RFID systems operating in the UHF band have unique attributes; 
in operation, the reader antenna emits electromagnetic energy in the form of radio 
waves that are directed toward an RFID tag. The tag absorbs energy, and through 
its built-in microchip/diode, uses it to change the load on the antenna, which in turn 
reflects back an altered signal to the reader. This method is known as backscatter 
and is the basis by which a passive RFID tag identifies its presence. These backscat-
tered signals are essentially at the same frequency as that of the transmitted signal. 
The backscattered signal antenna received is sent to the receiver through a di-
rectional coupler. The receiver front end must be designed to withstand high-inter-
ference signal levels without introducing significant distortion spurs. The receiver 
noise needs to be low enough that the system has sufficient dynamic range to allow 
error-free detection of low-level responding tag signals.
Homodyne detection, whereby a sample of the transmitted signal prior to mod-
ulation is used as the LO source for the receive I/Q demodulator, is utilized. Having 
both the transmitted and received signals at the same frequency exacerbates the 
difficulty of recovering the weak reflected signal, because it has to be identified in 
the presence of the higher powered carrier frequency. Consequently, it is an advan-
tageous to choose transceiver components that help improve the overall signal-to-
noise ratio as well as minimize LO carrier leakage. 
The I/Q demodulator is a key element that can be used to maximize the signal-
to-noise ratio and to minimize LO carrier leakage. Direct conversion to baseband 
frequency with the lowest BER and the highest sensitivity possible is crucial, not 
only for reader accuracy, but also to its range of usage.
5.5  RFID Power Sources
RFID tags need power to sense, compute, and communicate, which is further 
classified into three categories: storage (batteries, capacitors), energy harvesting 
mechanisms (vibrations/movement, photovoltaic, thermal gradient, and so on), and 
energy transfer (inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, backscatter). 
Because many of these devices are expected to operate with minimum of hu-
man intervention, optimizing power consumption is a very important research 
area. RFID tags may derive the energy to operate either from an on-tag battery or 
by scavenging power from the electromagnetic radiation emitted by tag readers. 
Storage refers to the way devices store power for their operation done either 
by using batteries or by using capacitors. Batteries are used when a longer life is 

5.5  RFID Power Sources 
187
required and capacitors are used in applications that require energy bursts for very 
short durations [13]. 
5.5.1  Power-Harvesting Systems
Power harvesting (sometimes termed energy scavenging) is the process of acquiring 
energy from the surrounding environment (ambient energy) and converting it into 
usable electrical energy; the self-winding watch is a historical example of a power-
harvesting device. The watches were wound by cleverly extracting mechanical en-
ergy from the wearer’s arm movements. 
Some of the other common energy conversion techniques are piezoelectric, 
thermoelectric, and so on. The energy transfer mechanisms are inductive coupling, 
capacitive coupling, and passive backscattering.
In medical devices, for example, a patient’s normal daily activities could power 
an implantable pump that delivers insulin to a diabetic. The use of piezoelectric 
materials to harvest power has already become popular; piezoelectric materials8 
have the ability to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge. Piezo 
elements are being imbedded in walkways to recover the “people energy” of foot-
steps. They can also be embedded in shoes to recover walking energy. 
Energy transfer is the way by which passive RF devices are powered. Inductive 
coupling is the transfer of energy between two electronic circuits due to the mutual 
inductance between the two circuits. Similarly, capacitive coupling is the transfer 
of energy between two circuits due to the mutual capacitance between the two cir-
cuits. Passive backscattering is a way of reflecting back the energy from one circuit 
to another.
Passive RFID tags obtain their operating power by harvesting energy from the 
electromagnetic field of the reader’s communication signal. The limited resources 
of a passive tag require it to both harvest its energy and communicate with a reader 
within a narrow frequency band as permitted by regulatory agencies. A passive 
tag’s power comes from the communication signal either through inductive cou-
pling or far-field energy harvesting. 
Inductive coupling uses the magnetic field generated by the communication 
signal to induce a current in its coupling element (usually a coiled antenna and a ca-
pacitor). The current induced in the coupling element charges the on-tag capacitor 
that provides the operating voltage, and power, for the tag. In this way, inductively 
coupled systems behave like loosely coupled transformers. Consequently, inductive 
coupling works only in the near field of the communication signal. 
Far-field energy harvesting uses the energy from the interrogation signal’s far-
field signal to power the tag. The signal incident upon the tag antenna induces a 
voltage at the input terminals of the tag. This voltage is detected by the RF front-
end circuitry of the tag and is used to charge a capacitor that provides the operat-
ing voltage for the tag. In the far field, tag-to-reader communication is achieved by 
modulating the RCS of the tag antenna (backscatter modulation).
8.	
The most common devices today that turn mechanical stress into electricity utilize piezoelectric materials. 
The phenomenon was first observed in 1880 by the brothers Pierre and Jacques Curie, but did not find a 
practical application until World War I when it was used by the French to develop an early form of sonar.

Components of the RFID System
There is a fundamental limitation on the power detected away from a reader 
antenna. In a lossless medium, the power transmitted by the reader decreases as 
a function of the inverse square of the distance from the reader antenna in the far 
field. A reader communicates with and powers a passive tag using the same signal. 
The fact that the same signal is used to transmit power and communicate data cre-
ates some challenging trade-offs. 
First, any modulation of the signal causes a reduction in power to the tag. Sec-
ond, modulating information onto an otherwise spectrally pure sinusoid spreads 
the signal in the frequency domain. This spread, referred to as a sideband, along 
with the maximum power transmitted at any frequency, is regulated by local gov-
ernment bodies in most parts of the world. These regulations limit the rate of infor-
mation that can be sent from the reader to the tag. RFID systems usually operate in 
license-exempt ISM bands, where the emitted power levels and the side band limits 
tend to be especially stringent.
The signaling from the tag to the reader in passive RFID systems is not achieved 
by active transmission. Because passive tags do not actively transmit a signal, they 
do not have a regulated limit on the rate of information that can be sent from the 
passive tag to the reader. Passive tags obtain impinging energy during reader inter-
rogation periods, and this energy is used to power tag IC. In the near-field, tag to 
reader communication is achieved by modulating the impedance (load modulation) 
of the tag as seen by the reader [14]. For the maximum reading range, one has to 
ensure the maximum power transfer efficiency from the reader to the tag. 
What makes the problem challenging is that in the case of inductively coupled 
reader and tag, the reader must deal with a changing effective load due to the 
location-dependent mutual coupling effect between the reader and tag as well as 
unpredictable number of tags in the read zone of the reader.
The powering of and communication with passive tags with the same com-
munication signal place restrictions on the functionality and transactions of which 
the tags are capable. Governmental regulations can further limit communication 
timings. In the U.S. 915-MHz ISM band, regulations require that, under certain 
operating conditions, the communication frequency change every 400 ms. Because 
every change in frequency may cause loss of communication with a tag, transpon-
ders must not be assumed to communicate effectively for longer than 400 ms. 
5.5.2  Active Power Sources
5.5.2.1  Batteries
Battery-assisted backscatter tags have their own power source to preenergize the 
silicon chip. The data is sent and received from the reader otherwise in the same 
way as a passive tag. This is a benefit where many tags are present in an interroga-
tion zone; if they are all passive, they all need a lot of energy initially to reach suf-
ficient voltage to turn on. With metals and fluids near tags, this is even harder due 
to interference and blind spots in the field. An on-board power source on each tag 
helps to overcome this. 
Primary lithium has been a favorite option in this market, as the chemistry of-
fers several positive factors including high energy-density, long life (approximately 

5.5  RFID Power Sources 
189
10 years), and long storage life. Additionally, this chemistry is ideal for RFID tag 
applications because it is lightweight. 
For RFID tag systems, primary lithium/manganese dioxide (Li-MnO2) and 
lithium-thionyl chloride (Li-SOCL2) are the two types of batteries that are most 
common. Lithium batteries offer a set of performance and safety characteristics 
that are optimal for RFID tag applications. Li-MnO2 is relatively safe, compared 
to volatile lithium batteries, such as lithium-sulfur dioxide (Li-SO2) and lithium-
thionyl chloride (Li-SOCL2), and does not develop any gas or pressure during bat-
tery operation.
However, one main disadvantage is that a single Li-MnO2 cell cannot operate 
at voltages greater than 3V. These are typical in high-pulse applications that Li-SO2 
and Li-SOCL2 can satisfy. Li-MnO2 cells are best suited for applications that have 
relatively high continuous or pulse current requirements. However, because most 
electronic components used in RFID tags require a minimum operating voltage 
of 3V, at least two Li-MnO2 cells must be connected in series to ensure a proper 
margin of safety for system reliability. This requirement adds weight and cost while 
potentially decreasing reliability due to increased part count.
Overall, the Li-MnO2 chemistry has a high energy density, and has the abil-
ity to maintain a high rate of discharge for long periods of time. It can be stored 
for a long time (typically between 5 and 10 years) due to its low self-discharge 
rates. It also has the capability to supply both pulse loads and maintain a constant 
discharge voltage. Li-MnO2 cells can operate in temperatures ranging from –20° 
to +70°C, although storage in temperatures exceeding +55°C is not highly recom-
mended, and operation will be below full energy capacity at low temperatures. 
Their nominal voltage is typically 3V, which is twice the amount of that found in 
alkaline manganese batteries.
Li-SOCL2 is a low-pressure system that is considered superior to lithium-sulfur 
dioxide systems in terms of high temperature and/or unusual form factor applica-
tions. Due to its low self-discharge rate, Li-SOCL2 has a shelf life of a maximum 
of 10 to 15 years. This service life is the same for all construction, whether it is 
cylindrical, coin, or wafer. This chemistry also has the highest open-circuit voltage 
of 3.6V.
For most applications, only one cell of Li-SOCL2 is required to maintain suf-
ficient operating voltage. This is true as long as one cell can provide enough current 
to uphold the operating lifetime. RFID tag applications require very low continu-
ous current and moderate pulse current, which Li-SOCL2 batteries have no prob-
lem providing.
5.5.2.2  Other Power Sources
In the design of mobile electronics, power is one of the most difficult restrictions 
to overcome, and current trends indicate that it will continue to be an issue in the 
future. Designers must weigh wireless connectivity, CPU speed, size, and other func-
tionality versus battery life in the creation of any mobile device. 
Power generation from the user may alleviate such design restrictions and may 
enable new products such as batteryless on-body sensors. Power may be recovered 
passively from body heat, arm motion, typing, and walking or actively through 
user actions such as winding or pedaling. In cases where the devices are not actively 

190 
�����������������������������
Components of the RFID System
driven, only limited power can generally be scavenged (with the possible exception 
of tapping into heel-strike energy) without inconveniencing or annoying the user. 
Clever power management techniques combined with new fabrication and 
device technologies are steadily decreasing the energy needed for electronics to 
perform useful functions, providing an increasingly relevant niche for power har-
vesting. Current and historical devices have shown that such mechanisms can be 
practical and desirable, yet much work remains in the creation and exploitation of 
these microgenerators.
RFID technology was thought to be a passive technology because the tags had 
no batteries; they just collected energy from the reader and send back their infor-
mation. New advancement in the technology allowed the development of enhanced 
tags (active RFID) whose function fills the gap between the RFID traditional field 
and wireless sensor networks field. 
Recent research has revealed nuclear power9 as possible source of power for 
wireless sensor and RFID networks [15]. While certainly a little bit frightening 
topic at the first thought, note that the isotopes used in the actual prototypes pen-
etrate no more than 25 µm in most solids and liquids, so in a battery they could be 
safely contained by a simple plastic package. 
The huge amount of energy these devices can produce is illustrated by the 
following numbers: the energy density measured in mWh/mg is 0.3 for a lithium-
ion battery, 3 for a methanol-based fuel cell, 850 for a tritium-based nuclear bat-
tery, and 57.000 for a polonium-210 nuclear battery. The current efficiency of a 
nuclear battery is around 4%, and current research projects (e.g., as part of the new  
DARPA program called Radio-Isotope Micropower Sources) aim at 20%. 
To make a little more sense out of these figures, for example, with 10 mg of po-
lonium-210 (contained in about 1 mm3), a nuclear battery could produce 50 mW 
of electric power for more than 4 months. 
A novel power supply for implantable biosensors has been described by Goto 
et al in [16]. In this power supply, near infrared light (NIR) transmission recharges 
a lithium secondary battery wirelessly through the skin. The Sun is a good source 
of NIR light, and its use requires no other external device to deliver energy to the 
recharging system. A photovoltaic cell array and the rectifier using Schottky diodes 
implanted beneath the skin can receive NIR light through the skin and charge the 
battery that is directly powering an implanted biosensor(s).
In 2008, a U.K.-based consortium of companies has successfully designed and 
clinically tested an in-body microgenerator that converts energy from the heart-
beat into power for implanted medical devices. The microgenerator could help 
power implanted medical devices by augmenting the existing battery for devices 
such as cardiac pacemakers and implanted defibrillators. In preclinical testing, the 
microgenerator successfully produced one-third of the energy required to power a 
conventional cardiac pacemaker [17].

5.6  Review Questions and Problems
1.	 The reader produces a magnetic field that triggers the tag as shown in 
Figure 5.20. When the reader receives the transmitted data, it interprets 
the data and takes appropriate action. When the transponder enters the 
field produced by the reader, the coil produces a voltage inside the tag. In a 
passive transponder, this voltage can be used to power the tag. In an active 
transponder, the voltage is used to wake the tag and use its internal battery. 
	
  Active transponders generally have longer read distances and shorter op-
erational life and are larger and more costly to manufacture. Passive tran-
sponders are generally smaller, have a longer life, and are less expensive to 
manufacture. For optimum performance, the transponder coil is used in a 
parallel LC circuit designed to resonate at the operating frequency of the 
reader.

RFID System Design Considerations
6.1  RFID System Main Considerations
6.1.1  Configuration Design
In practice, determining the number, type, and placement of readers and the manner 
in which they are connected to other sensors (e.g., motion detectors) and actuators 
(e.g., conveyor belt speed controls) is part of a large design challenge. 
As an example, suppose we wish to use RFID tags to keep track of rare books 
in a large bookstore; perhaps the most straightforward design is to assign a reader 
to each bookshelf in order to determine the books in its vicinity. However, the 
number of readers required by this design, and the implied size of higher-level in-
frastructure to support the data rate from them, may not be economically feasible. 
An alternate design is to assign readers to the points of entry and exit from 
aisles between bookshelves; in this case, we can infer the current location of a book 
based on the location of the reader that read its tag most recently. In the former 
case, tag readers provide state information (book x is at location y), whereas in 
the latter case, readers provide change-of-state (event) information (book x just 
entered aisle z). 
This design choice at the lower layers of the architecture would affect the 
amount and nature of data that must be stored at other layers, as well as the com-
plexity, and therefore cost of the system. In the state-based design, if all past sensor 
readings for book x are somehow lost (perhaps due to a system malfunction), the 
book can still be very easily located by simply issuing a query for its EPC. In the 
event-based design, this option may not be available because the current location 
of x is out of the range of all sensors [1].
Although hardware configurations (placement of readers, interconnections, 
and so on) are difficult to change on a frequent basis, the software configurations, 
which handle how readings are interpreted and routed, can be changed without 
much effort. This possibility provides the opportunity to rapidly incorporate new 
business processes into the RFID infrastructure.
During the system design stages, we have to keep in mind some of the basic 
constraints of the RFID systems and incorporate those in our approach (Figure 
6.1).

RFID System Design Considerations
When designing and inductively coupled RFID system (125 kHz and 13.56 
MHz) for optimum read range, we should primarily consider the reader’s power, 
the tag’s power consumption, and the tag’s quality factor, Q, the tag’s tuning, the 
reader’s antenna aperture, and the tag’s antenna aperture. 
Secondary considerations include the tag’s modulation depth, the reader’s 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the tag’s power-conversion efficiency, the reader’s an-
tenna tuning and carrier accuracy, the reader’s filter quality, how well the reader’s 
driver matches the antenna, the microcontroller’s speed and code efficiency, and 
the tag’s data rate.
Sometimes, the modulation type also affects read range. phase-shift-keying 
(PSK) and frequency-shift-keying (FSK) systems are inherently more immune to 
noise than amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) systems, because PSK and FSK systems 
use a subcarrier that noise cannot easily duplicate. In ASK systems, any sufficiently 
wide noise spike can look like data and corrupt a bit, so we must use checksums, 
parity schemes, or cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to counteract the noise. In PSK 
systems, 0° or 180° phase shift represents a binary bit (1 or 0) during the entire bit 
time; in FSK systems, two different subcarrier frequencies represent 1 or 0. 
However, in a passive system, the tag does not transmit anything, so there is 
no true subcarrier, only variations of AM. The use of checksums or CRCs and the 
range factors mentioned earlier affect read range so dramatically that any benefits 
of using FSK or PSK is usually insignificant. 
The application environment can also affect read/write range. Key factors in-
clude the proximity of the metal to the tag or reader antennas, the presence of in-
band noise sources, whether the tag and reader are stationary or moving, and the 
angle of the tag with regard to the reader’s H-field. Another environmental factor is 
whether the system is enclosed; a system in a shielded tunnel, for example, can use 
more power than one in the open air. Some of the additional challenges for RFID 
systems are large population of tags, dynamic tag population, random orientation 
of tagged objects, and a very high-speed reading.
Tag power consumption, turn-on voltage, and modulation depth vary dramati-
cally from model to model and manufacturer to manufacturer. In addition, chips 
for different bands typically have very different power requirements; for example, 
typical 13.56-MHz chip power-up at 4 Vpp and typically draw 7 μA, whereas the 
125-kHz chip powers up at 9 Vpp and draws 10 μA. 
Figure 6.1  Constraints on read/write range.

6.1  RFID System Main Considerations 
197
Power consumption differs widely for systems operating at 13.56 MHz, be-
cause CMOS devices consume more current proportionally as their clocking fre-
quency increases. This frequency-dependent consumption is not a problem in syn-
chronous tags operating at 125 kHz; however, a tag that is deriving its clock from 
a 13.56-MHz carrier has at least one gate that consumes 100 times more current 
than its counterpart in the 125-kHz tag. The rest of the divider chain draws as 
much or more than the fastest gate.
As a summary, we can say that the range of passive RFID systems is limited 
by such factors as tag characteristics, propagation environment, and RFID reader 
parameters. For example, high-frequency systems have better propagation charac-
teristics, but poorer range in clear air. Pallets, for example, may use UHF tags, but 
a box of strawberries may need an HF tag. 
Typically, reader sensitivity is high, and the tag limitation prevails. Tag range 
can be maximized by designing a high-gain antenna that is well matched to the chip 
impedance, but this is a task for electronics circuit design engineers and not system 
designers and/or integrators.
6.1.2  System Design Checklist
Recognizing opportunities for applying any technology, in this case RFID, is largely 
a matter of being aware of its capabilities and being able to see how those capabili-
ties relate to your own business operations, processes, services, and products. For 
an RFID project to be successful, it is necessary to approach the business problem 
and potential RFID solution using a systems approach.
During the design process, it is required to look at all the processes, plan for 
the future, and think creatively on how you to improve on each operation. RFID 
systems should be conceived, designed, and implemented using a systematic devel-
opment process in which end users and specialists work together to design RFID 
systems based on the analysis of the business requirements of the organization. 
Implementing an RFID-based system is like implementing any system; following a 
checklist will help define requirements: 
Systems:
•• Why are you implementing RFID?
•• Are you being mandated or are you looking at improving your internal 
operation?
•• Is there a requirement or preference for standards?
•• Is your market domestic, international, or both?
Tags:
•• Do you require disposable tags or are reusable tags acceptable?
•• Type of tag required (read-only, R/W, WORM)?
•• What is the maximum amount of data to be stored in the tag (data capacity)?
•• What data format will be used? 

198 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
•• How and where will the tags be applied?
•• What do you do when a tag is read?
•• What do you do if a tag is not read?
•• What are the tag redundancy requirements?
Reader:
•• What is the required read zone (width, height, and depth)?
•• How may tags will the reader read or write to at one time?
•• What are the possible location(s) for the tag?
•• What is the orientation of the tags and distance between tags?
•• At what speed and direction will the tags be traveling?
•• What error control and correction will be required?
•• Do you require any data security?
•• What will the required distance be between different reader antennas?
•• What is the distance between antenna location and the reader?
•• Is portability a requirement?
•• What are the data interface and protocol: reader/interrogator (batch, online, 
wireless, Ethernet) requirements?
Environment:
•• What is the proximity of tags and reader antenna proximity to metals, liq-
uids, and so forth?
•• What temperature and humidity will the equipment normally be exposed to? 
What about exposure to chemicals, UV and X-rays, mechanical stress, splash 
conditions, dust, and so forth?
Business:
•• What is an average cost per tag?
•• How is RFID implementation going to affect the bottom line?
•• What is the return on investment (ROI)?
Note that the larger the coverage area in the environment the greater the imple-
mentation challenges. Therefore, the longer reading distance between the tag and 
the reader, the more noise and interference that has to be contended with. 
Although problems with electrical noise are rare, it is a good practice to per-
form a site survey before commencing antenna design, than struggle to solve a 
problem later. In general, electrical noise tends to influence the receive performance 
and results in reduced reading ranges. Slight changes in antenna orientation to the 
noise source, additional grounding, or shielding can all help to reduce the effects 
of noise.
Not many of the off-the-shelf interrogators will survive all the extreme condi-
tions to which they may be subjected. Making the choice of a proper interrogator

for the specific environment is critical in reducing the costs involved with replacing 
frequently damaged equipment and the downtime associated with hardware fail-
ure. A thorough environmental study is always recommended, even if the condi-
tions seem to be readily apparent.
6.1.3  Carrier Frequency and Bandwidth
The carrier frequency and channel bandwidth are key considerations in RFID sys-
tems for a number of reasons, practical and legislative. Data is carried on a carrier 
frequency within a regulatory defined channel. The channel is characterized by the 
carrier frequency and the associated bandwidth or range of spectral allocation to 
accommodate the frequency spread relating to the data-modulated signal. 
The process of modulation invariably generates symmetric so-called sidebands, 
represented in stylized form as the shaded triangles in the diagram in Figure 6.2. 
Depending on the type of modulation, subcarrier components are used or pro-
duced as a result of the modulation process. For example, a technique often used 
for 13.56-MHz, high-frequency, RFID systems, uses a 212-kHz subcarrier to ac-
commodate the baseband coded data, resulting in two subcarrier modulation prod-
ucts, close to the reader carrier frequency but sufficiently distant to allow more 
effective detection and separation from the reader carrier. 
The bandwidth and the associated sensitivity to frequency components within 
the band, characterized for both tag and reader, are important for a number of 
reasons. They largely determine the performance of the transfer system, including 
susceptibility to interference. These quantities also have to be appropriately con-
trolled to meet regulatory requirements, to ensure they do not interfere with other 
spectrum users. 
A number of channels may be specified for use within a regulatory directive. 
Where this is so, the channels are sufficiently separated to avoid interference but 
also require protocols to allow access to these channels without contention. Where 
the bandwidth and sensitivity are specified, the density of readers for realizing 
coband operation (i.e., the minimum distance between readers) also becomes a 
consideration.
From a practical standpoint the choice of frequency, together with strength or 
power of the carrier, has a bearing upon the range of communication that can be

RFID System Design Considerations
achieved between tag and reader. To work, the tag has to receive a signal of suf-
ficient magnitude and the reader must be sufficiently sensitive to pick-up the tag 
response. Any carrier is subject to a reduction in strength the further it is detected 
from the source.
Other factors can also influence the magnitude of the signal over distance, in-
cluding objects and materials in the region between the tag and reader and mecha-
nisms that add noise or interference to the signal being communicated, making it 
difficult at the receiver end to distinguish the data carrying signal from the noise 
and interference signals.
6.1.4  Frequency Band Selection 
In practice, the region between the tag and interrogator may contain obstacles and 
materials that can influence the performance of the system (Figure 6.3). The carrier 
frequency is one of significance with respect to the effects that the prevailing condi-
tions and clutter factors (obstacles and physical structures) can have. 
In LF and HF inductive RFID systems, the magnetic field is effectively used to 
couple data and such fields are largely unaffected by dielectric or insulator mate-
rials (papers, plastics masonry, and ceramics, for example), the field simply pen-
etrates the materials. 
Metals can distort the field dependent upon how ferrous they are. This will 
weaken the field strength in regions of the interrogation zone, in some cases to 
the extent that the system performance is impaired. The range may be impaired or 
ability to read or write to a tag may be impaired. For uncompensated tag designs 
operating at resonant frequencies the presence of metals can often detune the de-
vice, in some cases preventing it to operate. 
At higher frequencies (UHF and above) where, for propagation RFID, the elec-
tric component of field becomes more significant the higher the frequency and the 
more easily that they can penetrate dielectric materials. However, for some mate-
rials where energy exchange mechanisms can be identified at or near the carrier

6.1  RFID System Main Considerations 
201
frequency, this can result in energy absorption from the propagating wave, so caus-
ing an impairment of range performance. Water molecules, for example, can have 
a significant effect upon microwave transmissions. 
As far as metals are concerned, they reflect or scatter these higher-frequency 
signals depending on the size of the metal object in relation to the wavelength of the 
incident signal. Such effects can impair the range that can be achieved and in some 
cases can screen the reader from the tag and prevent it from being read. 
Close proximity of tags may also exhibit a similar effect. Reflections and dif-
fraction effects can often allow pathways around metal objects within an inter-
rogation zone. Because it is difficult to generalize on the effects of clutter within 
the interrogation zone, it is expedient where possible to avoid clutter and choose a 
frequency band that is appropriate to the expected conditions.
6.1.5  Power and Range
From what has been said so far, the simple method to extending the range would 
be to increase the power to interrogate the tag and/or the power available within 
the tag to affect a response. Indeed this can be done, but only within specified and 
regulated limits. 
The extent to which a tag or reader is subject to noise and interference is essen-
tially governed by their respective bandwidth and sensitivity ratings. The greater 
the sensitivity, the smaller the signals it can respond to, providing they are within 
the bandwidth of the receiving device. The greater the bandwidth of the receiving 
device, the greater is the susceptibility to noise and interference. However, mitiga-
tion techniques may be used to help improve the performance in avoiding or reject-
ing unwanted signals.
The sensitivity, together with channel selection, can also have a bearing upon 
the relative positioning and density of readers. Where readers are operating within 
the same channel, without any access or anticontention management facilities, the 
allowable distance between readers is determined by the reader’s transmission sig-
nal strength and the receiver’s sensitivity. 
For given power or operational field strength, the greater the receiver sensitiv-
ity, the greater the separation has to be between readers. This, in turn, sets the limit 
on the density of readers that can be accommodated within a particular applica-
tion environment. To achieve effective functionality where readers are in range of 
each other, it is necessary for the readers to operate using appropriate mitigation or 
communication management techniques. These techniques include channel selec-
tion to avoid coband coincidence, operational duty cycles, or access management 
algorithms. 
In the United States, FCC regulations limit the amount of power that can be 
transmitted between 902 and 928 MHz to 30-dBm maximum transmitter power 
output and a maximum of 36-dBm ERP. A 6-dBi gain antenna (typical for RFID 
antennas) is added to 30-dBm transmitter power output and yields 36-dBm ERP. 
Sometimes we can find that reader is actually transmitting 32.5 dBm of power, not 
30 dBm as required by the FCC. The typical loss in antenna cables is about 2.5 
dB, so starting with 32.5 dBm coming out of the reader, and subtracting a 2.5 dB 
loss in the cables, means that 30.0 dBm of power arrives at the antenna. Generally 
speaking, we can say:

(6.1)
It is possible in the United States to use a higher-gain antenna, such as an 8-dBi 
antenna, as long as one reduces the transmitter power output by 2 dBm so that the 
ERP stays under the 36-dBm ERP limit. Generally, an 8-dBi gain antenna has a 
narrower beamwidth than a 6 dBi antenna, so doing this may be useful in specific 
situations where one wants a longer but narrower read field. 
In general, users tend to want the largest possible read field, and, given FCC 
constraints, that is accomplished with a 6-dBi antenna. It is not a good idea to 
change the power settings, cabling, or antenna that come with your reader, because 
this may violate FCC or other local regulations. Check your reader’s documenta-
tion or ask the manufacturer about changing power settings, cabling, and antennas 
that comply with relevant regulations.
6.1.6  Link Budget
Due to the indirect power supply it is essential to make a careful calculation of the 
power budget. Here, we are going to use a simplified approach and calculation using 
decibels (more detailed formulae and their derivations are presented in Chapter 5). 
Contributions from the transmitter and the reader antenna are relatively easy 
to evaluate; however, in the operational environment, the transmission setup and 
antenna are subject to strong variations due to the strongly variable environment. 
Modern systems are targeted for communication up to a few hundred tags, thus 
requiring good reliability (i.e., safety margins have to be included). In modeling a 
real situation with a reader, many tags and other objects in between is an important 
part, of the RFID system design, and the use of RF simulation tools in all parts of 
the system helps to predict the range of reliable operation. Typical UHF operating 
parameters are as follows:
•• Reader transmit power PR = 33 dBm (2W);
•• System operating wavelength λ = 0.33m (915 MHz);
•• Reader receiver sensitivity SR = -80 dBm (10–11 W);
•• Reader antenna gain GR = 4 (6 dBi);
•• Tag power (sensitivity) requirement PT = -14 dBm (40 µW);
•• Tag antenna gain GT = 1.26 (1 dBi);
•• Tag backscatter efficiency ET = 0.01 or 1% (–20 dB) calculated as (Δρ)2.
The differential reflection coefficient, Δρ, is described in Chapter 5 in more 
detail. 
6.1.6.1  Forward Link Budget
The signal received at the tag (Figure 6.4) has to be bigger or, in the worst case, 
equal to the tag sensitivity threshold. In case the tag is at the far edge of the inter-
rogation zone, we can say that:

The maximum free-space loss (FSL) allowed for this case is 47 dB. From the

915 MHz to be 5.8m (or approximately 19 feet).

The backscatter communication radio link budget, describes the amount of modu-
lated power that is scattered from the RF tag to the reader. The antenna gains in-
clude losses due to mismatch.

Thus, because SR = -80 dBm and PREC > SR, we still have around a 2-dB signal 
margin at the reader’s receiver. The question is whether the UHF read range is tag 
sensitivity limited or reader sensitivity limited. Well-designed passive systems are 
always limited by the tag’s sensitivity.
In practice, the maximum theoretical activation range is decreased by four 
types of additional losses:
Figure 6.5  UHF RFID reverse link budget.

6.1  RFID System Main Considerations 
205
•• Absorption: Because most RFID systems are deployed indoors and there is 
not always a line-of-sight path between tag and reader, the free-space as-
sumption is usually not valid. The electromagnetic wave supplying tags with 
power is, for example, completely reflected by perfect conductors and par-
tially reflected by perfect dielectrics. Real-world lossy dielectrics between the 
reader antenna and the tag antenna will also absorb some of the incident 
radiation, resulting in the read range significantly shorter than predicted 
theoretically.
•• Multipath fading: Even if there is line of sight between reader antenna and 
tag, small-scale fading effects can increase and decrease the read range. Mul-
tipath fading is caused by interference between two or more versions of the 
transmitted reader signal, which arrive at the receiver at slightly different 
times. These multipath waves combine at the receiver to result in a signal that 
can vary widely in amplitude and phase. Due to the constructive and destruc-
tive effects of multipath waves, a tag moving past a reader antenna can pass 
through several fades in a small period of time. If the tag passes through such 
a field null, it will lose power and possibly also its state. 
•• Polarization losses: The activation range is further significantly reduced by 
polarization losses, since the precise orientation of tags relative to the reader 
antenna is usually not known. Even when the reader is transmitting with a 
circularly polarized antenna, the transponder fails to be adequately powered 
when the axis of the tag dipole antenna is aligned with the propagation direc-
tion of the emitted electromagnetic wave. Circularly polarized antennas also 
introduce an additional loss of 3 dB. A promising approach to alleviate this 
orientation dependence is the use of two tag antennas that are orthogonally 
polarized and attached to the same microchip.
•• Impedance mismatch: The activation range predicted by the Friis transmis-
sion equation could, in practice, be further reduced by impedance mismatch 
between tag antenna and microchip. In most calculations, this fact is ne-
glected and perfect match is assumed.
The EIRP determines the power of the signal transmitted by the reader in the 
direction of the tag. The maximum allowed EIRP is limited by national regulations.
Chip sensitivity threshold is the most important tag limitation. It is the mini-
mum received RF power necessary to turn on an RFID chip [2]. The lower the 
required RF power, the longer the distance at which the tag can be detected. Chip 
sensitivity is primarily determined by RF front end architecture and fabrication 
process; RFID chips may also have several RF inputs connected to different an-
tenna ports. Antenna gain is another important limitation; tag range is highest in 
the direction of maximum gain that is fundamentally limited by the frequency of 
operation and the tag size. 
Reader sensitivity is another important parameter that defines the minimum 
level of the tag signal that the reader can detect and resolve. The sensitivity is 
usually defined with respect to a certain SNR or error probability at the receiver. 
Factors that can affect reader sensitivity include receiver implementation details, 

206 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
communication protocol specifics, and interference, including signals from other 
readers and tags. 
Tag detuning is due to the fact that antenna characteristics change when the tag 
is placed on different objects or when other objects are present in the vicinity of the 
tag. Tag detuning degrades antenna gain (due to changes in the radiation pattern) 
and impedance match, thus affecting the tag range.
Figure 6.6 shows that, although based on calculations and even RF measure-
ments, correct tag readings should be achieved without problem, at increased dis-
tances they will become increasingly unreliable. After a certain distance, the num-
ber of correct readings of the 60-tag pallet will decrease sharply with increasing 
distance.
6.1.7  Collision Avoidance
A major problem with RFID systems is that a tag might not be read, in spite of 
being in the reader’s range, due to collisions. A collision is said to have occurred 
when various devices interfere with each other’s operations or their simultaneous 
operations lead to loss of data. 
The reading process is not efficient due to various types of collisions, which are 
classified as follows:
•• Single reader-multiple tags collision: Multiple tags are present to communi-
cate with the reader. They respond simultaneously and reader is not able to 
interpret the signal.
•• Single tag-multiple readers collision: Single tag is in the range of two or more 
readers. Tags are mainly passive entities, so they do not have enough power 
to differentiate between frequency ranges of the readers. Tag interference is 
more common among active tags, in that they have a greater range and are 
more likely to interact with multiple readers at a given instant in time. When 
this problem exists in isolation, it is said to be a resource-constrained sched-
uling problem and solved using optimization methods.
Figure 6.6  The tag sensitivity limitation in practice.

6.1  RFID System Main Considerations 
207
•• Reader-reader collision: Two or more readers within the same frequency 
range interfere with each other’s operations.
These problems need to be resolved to provide efficient solutions for tag iden-
tification, and these are the major research areas where work needs to be done 
to practically implement RFID systems. Several metrics may be used to judge the 
quality of anticollision algorithms: performance, range, bandwidth requirements, 
implementation costs, noise and error tolerance, and security.
6.1.7.1  Tag-Tag Collision
In many existing applications, a single-read RFID tag is sufficient; animal tagging 
and access control are examples. However, in a growing number of new applica-
tions, the simultaneous reading of several tags in the same RF field is absolutely 
critical; library books, airline baggage, garments, and retail applications are a few. 
In order to read multiple tags simultaneously, the tag and reader must be designed 
to detect the condition that more than one tag is active. Otherwise, the tags will all 
backscatter the carrier at the same time, and the amplitude-modulated waveforms 
would be garbled. This is referred to as a collision, and no data would transfer to 
the reader.
With several entities communicating on a same channel, it is necessary to define 
some rules to avoid collisions and therefore to avoid information loss. The required 
rules are known as the collision avoidance protocol. The tags’ computational pow-
er is very limited and they are unable to communicate with each other. Therefore, 
the readers must deal with the collision avoidance themselves, without the help 
from the tags. Usually, readers query the tags until all identifiers are obtained. The 
process of addressing and isolating a single tag is referred to as singulation. We 
say that the reader performs the singulation of the tags because it can then request 
them selectively, without collision, by indicating the identifier of the queried tag in 
its request [3]. 
The collision avoidance protocols that are used in the current RFID systems are 
often proprietary (i.e., not open-source) algorithms. Therefore, obtaining informa-
tion on them is difficult. Currently, several open standards appear, and they are 
used more instead of proprietary solutions. 
We distinguish the EPC family from the ISO family; regardless of whether they 
are EPC or ISO, there are several collision avoidance protocols. Choosing one of 
them depends, in part, on the frequency used. EPC proposes standards for the most 
used frequency, that is, 13.56 MHz and 860 to 930 MHz. ISO proposes standards 
from 18000-1 to 18000-6, where 18000-3 corresponds to the frequency 13.56 
MHz and 18000-6 corresponds to the 860–960-MHz frequency. 
There are two main classes of collision avoidance protocols: the deterministic 
protocols and the probabilistic protocols. Usually, we use the probabilistic proto-
cols for systems that use 13.56-MHz frequency (the U.S. regulations in this band 
offer significantly less bandwidth), and the deterministic protocols for systems us-
ing the 860–960-MHz frequency because they are more efficient in this case. 
The deterministic protocols rely on the fact that each tag has a unique identi-
fier. If we want the singulation process to succeed, the identifiers must stay un-
changed until the end of the process. In the current tags, the identifiers are set by 

208 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
the manufacturer of the tag and written in the tag’s ROM. In normal RFID systems, 
there is no exchange after the singulation because the reader has obtained the ex-
pected information, that is, the identifiers of the tags which are in its field.
The probabilistic protocols are usually based on a time-division multiple access 
(TDMA) protocol, called ALOHA. The ALOHA1 protocol is a simple protocol 
originally developed for use in radio communication systems, but can be applied in 
every system where uncoordinated information is send over the same channel. The 
original protocol has two rules:
•• Whenever you have something to send, send it.
•• If there is a collision when transmitting (i.e., another entity is trying to send 
at the same time), try to resend later. This also applies in case of transmission 
failure.
In the tag-reader context, tags avoid collisions with other tags by randomly 
delaying their responses. If a collision does occur, the reader will inform all nearby 
tags and the culprits will wait another, usually longer, random interval before con-
tinuing. Higher densities of tags will result in a higher collision rate and degraded 
performance. The ISO 15693 standard for RFID supports a slotted ALOHA mode 
of anticollision. 
Slotted ALOHA is a more advanced, but still simple, protocol, where the re-
ceiving entity sends out a signal (called a beacon) at equally spaced intervals, thus 
dividing time into slots, and requiring synchronization. The beacon announces the 
start of a new slot and thereby the time to start sending the next packet for any 
entity having one ready. 
Several researchers have examined the issue of collision in RFID-tagged sys-
tems. The approaches taken in existing literature in this area fall into two broad 
categories: tree-based algorithms and variants of the ALOHA protocol [4]. The 
version of slotted ALOHA applied in RFID collects a number of consecutive slots 
into groups. At the beginning of each group the reader announces that only tran-
sponders with IDs starting with a specified substring are to answer now. Each 
tag thus activated picks a random number and waits for that many slots before 
transmitting.
In general, the number of slots is chosen randomly by the reader, which informs 
the tags that they will have n slots to answer to its singulation request. Each tag 
randomly chooses one slot among the n and responds to the reader when its slot 
arrives. If n is not sufficiently large with regard to the number of tags which are 
present, then some collisions occur. In order to recover the missing information, 
the reader interrogates the tags one more time. It can mute the tags that have not 
brought out collisions (switched-off technique) by indicating their identifiers or the 
time slots during which they transmitted. Also, according to the number of colli-
sions, it can choose a more appropriate n.

ALOHA is a random (or contention) access protocol developed at the University of Hawaii for sharing 
broadcast channel access among a number of users with relatively low-throughput demand. ALOHA pro-
tocols are often used in satellite communications systems and cellular radio systems and are a precursor to 
the popular Ethernet protocol.

6.1  RFID System Main Considerations 
209
Tag-tag collision occurs when multiple tags respond to the same reader simul-
taneously and due to multiple signals arriving at the same time, the reader may not 
be able to detect any tag. This problem prevents the reader from detecting all tags 
in its interrogation zone. A simple deterministic algorithm used to solve this prob-
lem is the tree-walking algorithm (TWA), which is generally used in UHF readers 
(Figure 6.7). 
In this protocol, the reader splits the entire ID space into two subsets and tries 
to identify the tags belonging to one of the subsets, recursing along the way until 
a subset has exactly one tag or no tags at all. To describe how a tree walk is per-
formed, a simple example is given in which the transponders IDs only consist of 3 
bits. Three transponders with the IDs 001, 011, and 110 are introduced into the 
reader’s scanning area. 
The reader first asks if any transponders have a 0 as the first bit. The 110 
transponder does not and goes into a sleep state, while the other two transponders 
answer. The reader then asks if any transponders have a 0 as the second bit. Again, 
this is confirmed by the 001 transponder, but the 011 transponder goes into a sleep 
state. Then the reader asks for transponders with a 0 as the third bit. Nobody 
answers, and 001 goes into the sleep state. Because nobody answers, the reader 
backs up one step and asks all transponders that confirmed their presence at the 
second bit to wake up. This reactivates 001. The reader now asks for transponders 
with a 1 as the third bit; 001 answers and is now fully identified. By continuing 
this back-up-one-step and forward-one-step sequence a number of times, all three 
transponders are identified. 
Due to larger turnaround times at lower frequencies, TWA is not deemed suit-
able for HF readers. Instead, the HF readers use a Slotted Termination Adaptive 
Collection (STAC) protocol somewhat similar to the framed ALOHA protocol.
The binary tree walking anticollision algorithm discussed here has an inherent 
security problem due to the asymmetry between forward and backward channel 
strengths. Every bit of every singulated tag is broadcast by the reader on the for-
ward channel. At certain operating frequencies, a long-range eavesdropper could 
monitor these transmissions from a range of up to 300 feet (100m) and recover the 
contents of every tag. A variant of binary tree walking, which does not broadcast 
insecure tag IDs on the forward channel and does not adversely affect performance, 
originally appeared under the name silent tree-walking.

RFID System Design Considerations
Assume that a population of tags share some common ID prefix, such as a 
product code or manufacturer ID. To singulate tags, the reader requests all tags to 
broadcast their next bit. If there is no collision, then all tags share the same value in 
that bit. A long-range eavesdropper can only monitor the forward channel and will 
not hear the tag response. Thus, the reader and the tags effectively share a secret bit 
value. When a collision does occur, the reader needs to specify which portion of the 
tag population should proceed. If no collisions occur, the reader may simply ask for 
the next bit, since all tags share the same value for the previous bit.
Since we assumed the tags shared some common prefix, the reader may obtain 
it as a shared secret on the uplink channel [5]. The shared secret prefix may be used 
to conceal the value of the unique portion of the IDs. Suppose we have two tags 
with ID values b1b2 and 
1
2.
b b  The reader will receive b1 from both tags without 
a collision and then will detect a collision on the next bit. Since b1 is hidden from 
long-range eavesdroppers, the reader may send either 
1
2
b
b
⊕
 or 
1
2
b
b
⊕
 to singu-
late the desired tag without revealing either bit. Eavesdroppers within the range of 
the backward channel will obviously obtain the entire ID. However, this blinded 
tree-walking scheme does effectively protect against long-range eavesdropping of 
the forward channel with little added complexity. Performance is identical to regu-
lar tree-walking, since a tag will be singulated when it has broadcast its entire ID 
on the backward channel.
A number of other variants of the same idea have been described in the literature.
6.1.7.2  Reader-Tag Collision
Reader-tag collision occurs when the signal from a neighboring reader interferes 
with tag responses being received at another reader. This problem has been studied 
in the EPCglobal Class1 Gen1 and Gen2 standards for UHF readers. In Gen 1 stan-
dard, the reader-tag collision problem is mitigated by allowing frequency hopping 
in the UHF band or by TDMA. In Gen 2 the readers and tags operate on different 
frequencies so that the tag response does not interfere or collide with reader signals. 
Either solution requires fairly sophisticated technology [6].
6.1.7.3  Reader-Reader Collision 
Large-scale RFID deployments in future will most likely involve multiple readers 
due to the fact that each RFID reader has a limited interrogation range. The reader 
can communicate with any tag within its interrogation range. The size and shape 
of the interrogation range of a particular reader are determined by many factors, 
including antenna characteristics, radio transmit power, radio obstructions, and 
wireless interferences. It also depends on characteristics of the tag. 
In many applications such as warehousing or manufacturing, a large area must 
be perfectly covered. This motivates the use of multiple RFID readers geographi-
cally dispersed and networked in some fashion (in an ad hoc network, for ex-
ample) and performing tag reading concurrently. Use of multiple readers not only 
improves coverage, but also improves read throughput by virtue of concurrent 
operation. However, several collision problems might occur when multiple readers 
are used in close proximity to each other. 

6.1  RFID System Main Considerations 
211
Colorwave is a distributed algorithm based on TDMA and one of the first 
works to address reader-reader collisions [7]. In particular, it considers an interfer-
ence graph over the readers, wherein there is an edge between two readers if they 
could lead to a reader-reader collision when transmitting simultaneously. It then 
tries to randomly color the readers such that each pair of interfering readers has 
different colors. If each color represents a time slot, then the above coloring should 
eliminate reader-reader collisions. If conflicts arise (i.e., two interfering readers 
pick the same color or time slot), only one of them wins (i.e., sticks to the chosen 
color); the others pick another color again randomly.
Some authors suggest coloring of the interference graph using k colors, where k 
is the number of available channels. If the graph is not k-colorable using their sug-
gested heuristic, then the authors suggest removal of certain edges and nodes from 
the interference graph using other methods that consider the size of the common 
interference regions between neighboring readers.
A query is said to be successfully sent if it is sent by a reader and is successfully 
received by all the tags in the read range, that is, if it does not collide with any other 
query in the network. Hence, if the reader does not receive any offline message for 
a query, the query is considered as being sent successfully. We define the system 
throughput as follows:
	
(
)
Total SuccessfulQuery All Readers
SystemThroughput
TotalTime
=
	
(6.5)
In general, the tag identification is through a query-response protocol where 
the reader sends a query and the tag responds with its unique identification num-
ber. The higher the number of queries sent successfully, the higher the through-
put and, hence, the higher would be the number of tags identified by the readers. 
Thus, throughput and efficiency together define the effectiveness of the anticolli-
sion protocol.
Engels et al. presented two algorithms called Distributed Color Selection (DCS) 
and Variable-maximum Distributed Color (VDCS) [8].
6.1.8  Tag Reading Reliability
Ghost reads occur when an RFID reader gathers information from a noisy environ-
ment and reports on a tag that does not exist. Reporting of phantom tags consumes 
processing and network time that may impact system reliability and performance. 
Statistically, there is always a chance of a ghost read; however, Gen 2 was spe-
cifically designed to address and minimize the occurrence of ghost reads. Statistics 
reveal that roughly one ghost read occurs per 1,000 tags. Gen 2 virtually eliminates 
the potential for these phantom reads, even in a noisy environment, by providing 
five sequential mechanisms that serve as checks for a tag’s validity. Only tags that 
pass all of these five tests are designated as valid tag reads and entered into the 
system:
1.	 Tag response time: Tags must respond to a reader within a very short, de-
fined time frame. If the tag response is not timed exactly from the beginning 

212 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
of a response to the end of the response, the probability that the tag is a 
phantom is high, so the reader will ignore the tag. The reader may try to 
reread the tag at a later time, possibly under different conditions.
2.	 Preamble: For each and every response, tags first send a signal called a pre-
amble. When a reader receives a valid preamble, it knows the signal is valid 
(from a real tag), and not simply noise. If the preamble is not valid, the 
reader discontinues communication and moves on to the next tag signal.
3.	 EPC format check: If the preamble is validated, the reader then examines 
the bit stream transmission to ensure it is in a valid EPC format. If the EPC 
format is validated, communication between tag and reader continues. If 
the EPC format is not validated, the reader begins communication with 
another tag.
4.	 Bit match: The reader compares the number of bits the Gen 2 tag reported 
that it would be sending to the number of bits received; if it is not a match, 
the information is discarded.
5.	 CRC: The CRC checks for bit errors in transmission by comparing the 
number of bits the tag stated it would send with the number of bits actually 
sent. If the correct number of bits was received, the transmission is verified 
as accurate. If the correct number of bits is not received, the data is rejected 
and the reader moves on to begin communication with the next tag.
6.2  RFID Reader-Tag Communication Channel
Irrespective of the mode of coupling (inductive or propagation), the means of effec-
tively transferring data between tag and reader relies upon a dialogue between the 
two, based upon command data within the reader and the tag response signals, the 
dialogue generally being initiated by the reader (reader talk first). 
However, in some RFID systems the tag may operate in a beacon type mode 
(active tags) and effectively talk first. Suffice is to say at this stage that the objective 
in either case is to transfer data, so the dialogue essentially requires the tag to be 
identified and the data to be requested, acknowledged, and sent. To achieve this, it 
is necessary for data to be written or encoded into a tag in a particular way:
1.	 With other data elements added to facilitate identification, description of 
the source data (the data required to be carried and used at the receiver end 
of communications) components (so-called metadata), and, as appropri-
ate, elements used for error detection and correction, contention manage-
ment, and communications dialogue are included. This is generally known 
as source encoding.
2.	 The source-encoded message is structured by certain baseband techniques 
to better match the signal form of the message to be sent to the charac-
teristics of the transmission channel or medium through which it is to be 
transmitted. This is process is often referred to as channel encoding.
The data communicated between tags and readers must be sent in a reli-
able manner. With data encoded in this way, the final conditioning that is used 
to facilitate transmission is the modulation of the encoded data using a suitable 

6.2  RFID Reader-Tag Communication Channel 
213
frequency-defined carrier signal. At the receiver end the reverse of these processing 
elements are performed (demodulation, together with channel and source decoding) 
to recover the source data. A variety of techniques are used for channel encoding 
and modulation distinguished by particular performance and cost characteristics. 
The combination of coding and modulation schemes determines the band-
width, integrity, and tag power consumption. The coding and modulation used 
in RFID communications is limited by the power and modulation/demodulation 
capabilities of the tags. 
Another limiting factor is the bandwidth occupied by the signal; RFID tags that 
are passive do not transmit signals actively and therefore can use more bandwidth 
than a reader. A reader has its own power source and therefore is required by regu-
lations to use less bandwidth.
6.2.1  Data Content and Encoding
Line coding involves converting a sequence of 1s and 0s to a time-domain signal (a 
sequence of pulses) suitable for transmission over a channel. The following primary 
factors should be considered when choosing or designing a line code:
1.	 Self-synchronization: Timing information should be built into the time-
domain signal so that the timing information can be extracted for clock 
synchronization. A long string of consecutive 1s and 0s should not cause a 
problem in clock recovery.
2.	 Transmission power and bandwidth efficiency: The transmitted power 
should be as small as possible, and the transmission bandwidth needs to be 
sufficiently small compared to the channel bandwidth so that intersymbol 
interference will not be a problem.
3.	 Favorable power spectral density: The spectrum of the time-domain signal 
should be suitable for the transmission channel. For example, if a channel 
is ac coupled, it is desirable to have zero power spectral density near dc to 
avoid dc wandering in the pulse stream.
4.	 Low probability of error: When the received signal is corrupted by noise, 
the receiver can easily recover the uncoded signal with low error probability.
5.	 Error detection and correction capability: The line code should have error 
detection capability, and preferably have error correction capability.
6.	 Transparency: It should be possible to transmit every signal sequence cor-
rectly regardless of the patterns of 1s and 0s. If the data are coded so that 
the coded signal is received correctly, the code is transparent.
There are two broad categories of codes used in RFID: level codes and transi-
tion codes. Level codes represent the bit with their voltage level. Transition codes 
capture the bit as a change in level. Level codes, such as nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) 
and return-to-zero (RZ), tend to be history independent; however, they are not very 
robust. Transition codes can be history-dependent, and they can be robust. 
Transmitter (tag) is responsible for encoding, that is, inserting clocks into the 
data stream according to a select coding scheme while the receiver (reader) is re-
sponsible for decoding (separating) clocks and data from the incoming embedded 
data stream.

214 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
Readers are capable of transmitting at high power, but are limited to narrow 
communication bands by communications regulations; therefore, the encoding 
used from reader to tag usually needs to occupy a low bandwidth. Passive tags, 
however, do not actively transmit a signal; therefore, the encoding used for tag 
to reader communication can occupy a high bandwidth. There are many types of 
line codes, but we will only discuss a few of them that are important for our RFID 
discussion (see Figure 6.8). More general information about data encoding can be 
found in [9]. 
6.2.1.1  Nonreturn-to-Zero Coding
The simplest channel code is the one known as nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ). Simple, 
combinational logic, signals are a good example of NRZ, where a logical 1 is coded 
as one DC level and logic 0 as another. NRZ requires time coordination, but longs 
strings of 0s and 1s do not produce any transitions that may create problems in 
error detection and recovery. NRZ produces a high dc level (an average of 0.5V). 
NRZ is rarely used for serial transmission, except for relatively low-speed opera-
tions such as those associated with modem transfers.
Serial transmission in wired systems generally consists of at least two trans-
mission lines: one carrying the data, and the other the clock to which the data 
is synchronized. Wireless transmission, however, is an entirely different situation; 
wireless data has only one medium to travel through, the air, and, as such, cannot 
support separate transmission of data and clock. Therefore, traditional NRZ data, 
in which a logic one is a high signal for one clock period and a logic zero is a low 
signal for one clock period, cannot be used. 
Figure 6.8  Examples of several coding schemes.

6.2  RFID Reader-Tag Communication Channel 
215
A data stream, in general, can contain long strings of ones or zeros; these would 
be represented in an NRZ stream by very long dc values, during which the receiv-
ing system may lose synchronization with the transmitter’s clock. To combat this, 
the Manchester code, for example, can be used. 
6.2.1.2  Return to Zero (RZ)
Return-to-zero (RZ) describes a line code used in telecommunications signals in 
which the signal drops (returns) to 0 between each pulse. This takes place even if 
a number of consecutive 0s or 1s occur in the signal. This means that a separate 
clock does not need to be sent alongside the signal, but suffers from using twice 
the bandwidth (data rate) as compared to NRZ format. The signal is self-clocking.
Although RZ contains a provision for synchronization, it still has a dc com-
ponent resulting in baseline wander during long strings of 0 or 1 bits, just like the 
NRZ line code. A variant of RZ is RZ-inverted, which swaps the signal values for 
1 and 0. 
6.2.1.3  Biphase Mark (Manchester) Coding 
Manchester coding incorporates a transition in the middle of every transmitted bit. 
Logic 1 is represented by a transition from low to high, and logic 0 is represented 
by a transition from high to low. Because the transmitted signal must change at 
least once for every bit transmitted, the problem of transmitting long dc values is 
eliminated. The Manchester code provides for efficient communication since the 
bit rate is equal to the bandwidth of the communication. Biphased data streams 
have generally a signal change in the middle of each bit, independent of the value. 
Therefore, the signal does not necessarily return to zero. The characteristics of the 
biphase method are:
•• Synchronization: Because the transition for each bit is predictable, the receiver 
can synchronize on this edge. These codes are also known as self-clocking.
•• Error immunity: To cause an error, the noise must invert both, the signal 
before and after the transition.
•• A 1-to-0 transition represents a 0 bit.
•• A 0-to-1 transition represents a 1 bit.
•• The mid-bit transition is used as clock as well as data.
•• The residual dc value is eliminated by having both polarities for every bit.
•• The bandwidth required could be twice the bit rate (efficiency of this code 
can be as low as 50%).
Unlike NRZ data with a separate clock signal, the clock is not provided explic-
itly to the device receiving Manchester encoded data; instead, it is given, encoded, 
in the transmitted data so the clock must be recovered from the data. Traditionally, 
this is accomplished via a Phase-locked Loop (PLL) that takes in the received data 
stream and outputs the transmitter’s clock.

RFID System Design Considerations
6.2.1.4  FM0 Coding
EPCglobal Class 1 Gen 2 provides multiple options for tag coding and the simplest 
approach is FM0 coding. In FM0 coding (biphase space), a transition has to occur 
at the end of each bit period, but for a 0 bit, an addition transition in the middle is 
required. The duty cycle of a 00 or 11 sequence, measured at the modulator output, 
shall be a minimum of 45% and a maximum of 55%, with a nominal value of 50%. 
FM0 encoding has memory; consequently, the choice of FM0 sequences de-
pends on prior transmissions. FM0 signaling always ends with a dummy data, 
which is a 1 bit at the end of a transmission.
6.2.1.5  Miller Coding
Miller coding is also called a delay modulation and provides a transition for every 
bit. In this code a 1 is encoded as a transition occurring at the center of the bit cell, 
while consecutive 0s have a transition at the cell boundary between them. This 
means that a pattern such as 10101 has no transitions at the cell boundaries.
•• There is a transition in the middle of a bit period, if it is a 1 bit.
•• There is a transition at the start of the bit period if the bit 0 is followed by a 
0 bit.
•• For a 0 followed by a 1 or a 1 followed by a 0, no transition occurs at the 
symbol interval.
This code is very efficient in terms of the desired bandwidth (half of the desired 
bandwidth of Manchester coding). Miller coding is self-clocking and has a rela-
tively low LF content but is not dc-free, however. 
Miller squared coding (so called because it was the result of a modification 
of Miller coding by a second, quite separate Miller) has one additional rule. This 
states that the final transition of an even number of 1s occurring between two 0s 
is omitted (i.e., 01110 occupies five cells and has three transitions, while 011110 
occupies six cells but also has three transitions), thus making the code dc-free.
6.2.2  Modulation
The data coding scheme determines how the data is represented in a continuous 
stream of bits. How that stream of bits is communicated between the tag and the 
reader is determined by the modulation scheme. Each RFID standard employs one 
modulation scheme for the forward link (reader-to-tag) and another for the reverse 
link (tag-to-reader). 
The modulation schemes reflect the different roles of reader and tag. The read-
er must send enough RF power to keep the tag powered. A passive tag does not 
transmit its own signals but modulates by changing the phase or amplitude of the 
reader’s transmitted signal that is being backscattered (in UHF system) from its 
antenna.
For convenience, RF communications typically modulate a high-frequency car-
rier signal to transmit the baseband code. RFID systems usually employ modula-
tion techniques and coding schemes that are simple to produce. The three classes 

6.2  RFID Reader-Tag Communication Channel 
217
of digital modulation are ASK, FSK, and PSK. The choice of modulation is based 
on power consumption, reliability requirements, and bandwidth requirements. All 
three forms of modulation may be used in the return signal, although ASK is most 
common in load modulation at 13.56 MHz, and PSK is most common in backscat-
ter modulation. 
The choice is essentially determined by performance requirements and cost. 
For example, ISO 18000 Type C (also known as EPC Gen2, Class 1) calls for 
double sideband-ASK (DSB-ASK), single sideband-ASK (SSB-ASK), and phase-re-
versal-ASK (PR-ASK). ASK digital modulations are spectrally inefficient, requiring 
substantial RF bandwidth for a given data rate. Bandwidth efficiencies of 0.20 bit 
per hertz of RF bandwidth are not uncommon for DSB-ASK.
It is possible to improve bandwidth efficiency using SSB-ASK. This is particu-
larly important in European countries where bandwidth restrictions may preclude 
DSB-ASK. The power efficiency of DSB-ASK and SSB-ASK is dependent on the 
modulation index. With a modulation index of 1, or on-off keying (OOK) of the 
carrier, the lowest carrier-to-noise (C/N) required to achieve a given bit error rate 
(BER) is obtained for DSB-ASK and SSB-ASK. Unfortunately, this also provides the 
least amount of RF power transport on the downlink to supply the tag with energy. 
Ideally, the off time of the carrier should be minimized so that the tag does not run 
out of power. The C/N requirements should also be minimized to maximize the ID 
read range. For many modulations, these are conflicting requirements.
A modulation that can minimize the C/N requirement in a narrowband, while 
maximizing the power transport to the tag, is PR-ASK. Similar to a PSK signal, 
PR-ASK changes phase 180º each time a symbol is sent. PR-ASK also creates an 
amplitude modulation depth of 100% or a modulation index of 1, as the phase 
vector of the old symbol and the new symbol cross and briefly sum to a zero mag-
nitude. This provides an easily detected clock signal as the amplitude briefly goes 
to zero, but minimizes the time the carrier power is off, so power transport to the 
passive tag is optimized. PR-ASK has carrier to noise and bandwidth requirements 
that more closely match PSK than DSB-ASK, making it attractive for narrowband 
and longer-range applications.
DSB-ASK is the least bandwidth efficient modulation, but the easiest to pro-
duce by OOK of the carrier signal. ASK modulation specifications often have a 
modulation depth as well as rise and fall time requirements. The rise and fall time 
is typically related to the bandwidth filtering while the modulation depth is set by 
the attenuation difference between the keying states. 
Passive RFID tags operate in a way that may seem unusual because there is 
only one transmitter; the passive tag is not a transmitter or transponder in the pur-
est definition of the term, yet bidirectional communication is taking place. The RF 
field generated by the reader (the energy transmitter) has three purposes:
1.	 Induce enough power into the tag coil to energize the tag. Passive tags have 
no battery or other power source, so they must derive all power for opera-
tion from the reader field. The 125-kHz and 13.56-MHz tag designs must 
operate over a wide dynamic range of carrier input, from the very near field 
(in the range of 200 VPP) to the maximum read distance (in the range of
5 VPP).

218 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
2.	 Provide a synchronized clock source to the tag. Many RFID tags divide the 
carrier frequency down to generate an on-board clock for state machines, 
counters, and so forth, and to derive the data transmission bit rate for data 
returned to the reader. Some tags, however, employ onboard oscillators for 
clock generation.
3.	 Act as a carrier for return data from the tag. Backscatter modulation re-
quires the reader to peak-detect the tag’s modulation of the reader’s own 
carrier. 
Although all the data is transferred to the host by amplitude-modulating the 
carrier (backscatter modulation), the actual modulation of 1s and 0s is accom-
plished with three additional modulation methods: 
•• Direct modulation: The amplitude modulation of the backscatter approach 
is the only modulation used. A high in the envelope is a 1 and a low is a 0. 
Direct modulation can provide a high data rate but low noise immunity.
•• FSK: This form of modulation uses two different frequencies for data trans-
fer; the most common FSK mode is Fc/8 and Fc/10. A 0 is transmitted as an 
amplitude-modulated clock cycle with period corresponding to the carrier 
frequency divided by 8, and a 1 is transmitted as an amplitude-modulated 
clock cycle period corresponding to the carrier frequency divided by 10. 
•• The amplitude modulation of the carrier thus switches from Fc/8 to Fc/10 
corresponding to 0s and 1s in the bit stream, and the reader has only to count 
cycles between the peak-detected clock edges to decode the data. FSK allows 
for a simple reader design and provides very strong noise immunity, but suf-
fers from a lower data rate than some other forms of data modulation. 
•• PSK: This method of data modulation is similar to FSK, except only one fre-
quency is used, and the shift between 1s and 0s is accomplished by shifting 
the phase of the backscatter clock by 180°. Two common types of PSK are: 
(1) change phase at any 0 or (2) change phase at any data change (0 to 1 or 
1 to 0). PSK provides fairly good noise immunity, a moderately simple reader 
design, and a faster data rate than FSK.
Regardless of what method of carrier modulation is implemented, any voltage 
modulation sequence controlled through the tag’s memory or circuitry will result in 
the transmission of a bit pattern that mimics the modulation sequence. Therefore, 
essentially any binary information stored on the tag can be wirelessly transmitted 
back to the receiver. 
As already mentioned, a problem unique to RFID systems is the vast difference 
in power between the signal outgoing from the reader and that returning to the 
reader as reflected from the tag. In some situations, this difference may be in the 
range of 80 to 90 dB, and the return signal may be impossible to detect. To avoid 
this problem, the return signal is sometimes modulated onto a subcarrier, which 
is then modulated on to the carrier. For example, in the ISO 15693 standard for 
RFID, a subcarrier of 13.56 MHz/32 = 423.75 kHz is used.
As defined by ISO/IEC 18000-3 (13.56 MHz), the modulation used is typi-
cally ASK (either 10% or 100%) for the forward link (reader to tag) and load 

6.2  RFID Reader-Tag Communication Channel 
219
modulation for the reverse link with a rate defined as a division of the carrier. 
The load modulation produces subcarriers, which utilize binary phase-shift-keying 
(BPSK) modulation. Load modulation appears in the frequency domain as side-
bands offset by the subcarrier frequency from the transmission frequency. Figure 
6.9 illustrates this approach.
Future development of RFID devices will include more complex modulation 
schemes, for example technologies such as software defined radio (SDR) are imple-
mented in dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and other applications.
6.2.3  Data Encryption
RFID readers in public places can read the RFID data and connect to networks that 
provide real-time data about the owners and thus infringe on privacy. Encryption 
of data will help to solve this problem to certain extent. Encryption of the RFID tag 
contents will ensure that unauthorized readers are not able to access the data or, 
even if they can get the encrypted content, they do not have the access to encryption 
key. There are many encryption algorithms available that can be suitably used to 
encrypt the data on RFID.
EPCglobal has ratified its Gen2 global standard that uses frequency and power 
in a way that complies with the major regional regulatory environments. In addi-
tion to improvements in security of the data on the tag, the standard includes the 
ability to lock the identification fields in the tag, so that they cannot be spoofed 
or changed without a password. It also includes a strong kill mechanism, so retail-
ers and others have the option of automatically erasing all data from the tag as it 
passes through a reader. 
However, the standard does not allow for encryption, because one of the user 
requirements for the standard was that the tags be inexpensive. However, security 
issues will continue to be addressed in the hardware and policy working groups 
[10] and, in the meantime, implemented as proprietary solutions (AES, for ex-
ample) by some of the equipment suppliers.
Current implementations of secure RFID rely on digital cryptographic primi-
tives in the form of hashes and block ciphers. The presence of these blocks is mo-
tivated by privacy requirements, but they increase the overall processing latency,

the power consumption, and the silicon area budget of the RFID tag. In addition, 
existing passive RFID systems rely on simple coding and modulation schemes using 
narrowband frequencies, which can be easily eavesdropped on or jammed.
6.2.3.1  Data Encryption Standard 
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm is the most widely used encryption 
algorithm in the world. For many years, and among many people, secret code-
making and DES have been synonymous. DES works on bits or binary numbers: 
the 0s and 1s common to digital computers. Each group of 4 bits makes up a hexa-
decimal, or base 16, number. Binary 0001 is equal to the hexadecimal number 1; 
binary 1000 is equal to the hexadecimal number 8; 1001 is equal to the hexadeci-
mal number 9; 1010 is equal to the hexadecimal number A; and 1111 is equal to 
the hexadecimal number F. 
DES works by encrypting groups of 64 message bits, which is the same as 16 
hexadecimal numbers. To do the encryption, DES uses keys, which are also appar-
ently 16 hexadecimal numbers long or apparently 64 bits long. However, every 
eighth key bit is ignored in the DES algorithm, so that the effective key size is 56 
bits. In any case, 64 bits (16 hexadecimal digits) is the round number upon which 
DES is organized. 
In cryptography, triple-DES is a block cipher formed from the DES cipher by 
using it three times. Given a plaintext message, the first key is used to DES-encrypt 
the message. The second key is used to DES-decrypt the encrypted message, and 
since the second key is not the right key, this decryption just scrambles the data 
further. The twice-scrambled message is then encrypted again, with the third key to 
yield the final ciphertext. In general, Triple-DES with three different keys has a key 
length of 168 bits: three 56-bit DES keys (with parity bits triple-DES has the total 
storage length of 192 bits), but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack, the effective 
security it provides is only 112 bits.
Triple-DES is slowly disappearing from use, largely replaced by its natural 
successor, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). One large-scale exception is 
within the electronic payments industry, which still uses these methods extensively 
and continues to develop and promulgate standards based upon it. This guarantees 
that triple-DES will remain an active cryptographic standard well into the future. 
By design, DES and therefore triple-DES, suffer from slow performance in soft-
ware; on modern processors, AES tends to be around six times faster. 
Triple-DES is still in use in connection with some hardware implementations, 
but even there AES outperforms it. Finally, AES offers markedly higher security 
margins; a larger block size, potentially longer keys, and hopefully freedom from 
cryptanalytic attacks.
6.2.3.2  Advanced Encryption Standard
AES was the result of a worldwide call for submissions of encryption algorithms 
issued by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1997 
and completed in 2000. The winning algorithm, Rijndael, was developed by two 
Belgian cryptologists, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen. AES provides strong en-
cryption and was selected by NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard in 

6.3  Testing and Conformance 
221
2001, and in 2003 the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) announced that AES 
was secure enough to protect classified information up to the top-secret level, which 
is the highest security level, and defined as information which would cause excep-
tionally grave damage to national security if disclosed to the public [11].
The AES algorithm uses one of three cipher key strengths: a 128-, 192-, or 256-
bit encryption key (password). Each encryption key size causes the algorithm to 
behave slightly differently, so the increasing key sizes not only offer a larger number 
of bits with which the data can be scrambled, but also increase the complexity of 
the cipher algorithm. AES is fast in both software and hardware, is relatively easy 
to implement, and requires little memory, and, as a new encryption standard, it is 
currently being deployed on a large scale.
6.3  Testing and Conformance
6.3.1  Test Equipment
The RFID engineers today face a variety of design and test challenges to bring a 
product to market. First, the product must meet local frequency regulations to 
emit energy into the spectrum; next, the interrogator and tag interaction must reli-
ably work together. To accomplish this, both the interrogator and tag must comply 
with the appropriate industry standard. Finally, to be competitive, the RFID sys-
tem’s performance must be optimized to appeal to a particular market segment. 
This could mean maximizing the number of transactions per second, operating in 
a dense reader environment, or stretching the reader’s ability to communicate over 
longer distances. 
RFID systems, particularly those with backscattering passive tags, present some 
unique challenges for test and diagnostics. Timing measurements are of particular 
concern, as system readers can be required to read the ID data from many tags very 
quickly without error. Most RFID systems use transient Time Division Duplexing 
(TDD) schemes, where the interrogator and tags take turns communicating on 
the same channel. To read many ID tags within a very short period of time with a 
serial TDD multiplexing scheme, the standards call for very precise timing. Tim-
ing measurements on the data interchange thus present a unique RFID challenge. 
The transient RFID signals often contain spectrally inefficient modulations using 
special PCM symbol encoding and decoding. Troubleshooting the homodyne inter-
rogators or tags that receive these unusual signals requires special signal analyzer 
capabilities. Traditionally, swept tuned spectrum analyzers, vector signal analyzers, 
and oscilloscopes have been used for wireless data link development. 
The spectrum analyzer has historically been the tool of choice to characterize 
the RF spectral output of a transmitter to ensure compliance with regulatory emis-
sion restrictions. The traditional swept tuned spectrum analyzer was developed 
primarily for the analysis of continuous signals, not the intermittent RF transients 
associated with modern RFID products. This can lead to a variety of measure-
ment issues, particularly the accurate capture and characterization of transient RF 
signals.
Similarly, the vector signal analyzer possesses little ability to capture transient 
RF signals, also being initially developed for CW signals. Though most vector 

222 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
signal analyzers have extensive demodulation ability for popular spectrally efficient 
modulations, current offerings have virtually nothing to support the spectrally inef-
ficient RFID modulations and their special PCM decoding requirements. 
The oscilloscope has long been a valuable tool for analysis of baseband sig-
nals. In recent years some oscilloscopes have extended their sampling speed to very 
high microwave frequencies. They are, however, still suboptimal tools for UHF 
or higher frequency measurements on RFID systems. Relative to the modern real-
time spectrum analyzer, the fast oscilloscope has substantially less measurement 
dynamic range and lacks modulation and decoding capability.
The real-time spectrum analyzer (RTSA) solves the limitations of the tradi-
tional measurement tools to provide a substantially more efficient test and diag-
nostic experience for the RFID engineer [12]. Pulsed tag reads and writes require 
an RF analyzer optimized for transient signals. The RTSA has the digital processing 
speed necessary to transform the input signal from time domain samples into the 
frequency domain with a real-time FFT prior to capturing a recording of data. This 
enables the RTSA to compare spectral amplitudes to a frequency mask set by the 
user in real time. The RTSA can then trigger a capture on a spectral event of interest 
for subsequent detailed off-line analysis.
Many RFID and near-field communications (NFC) devices use proprietary 
communications schemes that are optimized for specific market applications, so 
the test equipment should offer a variety of flexible modulation measurements that 
enable testing of the proprietary systems with manually configured measurements. 
The instrument should allow a user to define the modulation type, decoding for-
mat, and data rate. 
Once the basic specifications are met, it is important to optimize some of the 
RFID product’s features to gain a competitive advantage in a particular market seg-
ment. One such example is optimizing the number of tag reads possible in a given 
amount of time, resulting in the overall system capacity increase, and thus making 
it more appealing to high volume applications. An important element in maximiz-
ing capacity is minimizing the turnaround time for each tag reply; available RF 
power, path fading, and altered symbol rates can lengthen the time it takes for the 
tag to reply to the interrogator’s query. The slower the reply, the longer it will take 
to read large number of tags.
6.3.2  Frequency and Bandwidth-Related Measurement
As mentioned earlier, bending tags or placing them in close proximity to conduc-
tive objects and other tags can detune the tag antenna, preventing them from going 
into resonance and thus either becoming inoperative or significantly reducing the 
operating range. Consequently, frequency deviation measurements are critical to 
ensuring compliance with various RFID and transmitter standards. For example, 
frequency accuracy for a 13.56-MHz RFID interrogator is typically specified at ±7 
kHz. 
Similar to frequency deviation measurements, occupied bandwidth measure-
ments ensure compliance with standards designed to prevent interference with 
other signals. RFID readers and tags are intentional transmitters that fall under 

6.3  Testing and Conformance 
223
regional regulations, such as FCC 47 part 15 in the United States, EN 300 330 in 
Europe, and ARIB STDT60/T-82 in Japan. As RFID heads towards global accep-
tance, the most stringent of these regulations will apply. 
Also under close scrutiny is the effect of human exposure to RFID electromag-
netic fields as spelled out in documents such as IEEE C.95-1 and EN50364:2010 
[“Limitations of Human Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields from Devices Operat-
ing in the Frequency Range 0 Hz to 10 GHz, Used in Electronic Article Surveillance 
(EAS), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Similar Applications”]. 
Various regulations will define limits using different units of measurement. The 
power flux density, S [mW/cm2], electric field strength, E [V/m], and magnetic field 
strength, H [A/m], are interchangeable (see Chapter 5 for more details) according 
to the following equation:

(6.6)
6.3.3  Polling and Timing Measurements
When the RFID reader/interrogator searches for a tag, it is referred to as polling. 
Associated with polling is a number of timing measurements called out in various 
RFID standards. One key timing measurement is turnaround time, for both the 
transmit-to-receive and receive-to-transmit modes. Other timing measurements are 
dwell time or interrogator transmit power on ramp, decay time or interrogator 
transmit power down ramp, and pulse pause timing.
6.3.4  Collision Management
ISO/IEC 18000-3 calls for reading 500 tags within 390 ms. It also calls for reading 
50 words of data within 930 ms from static tags, and 944 ms from active tags. If 
only a PC is used to time stamp the interactions and test for compliance, there is no 
way to know why the interaction takes so long, at which point a is collision occur-
ring, or where there is a particular tag that is being problematic.
However, by using test equipment and monitoring the over-the-air interface 
during polling, it is possible to troubleshoot when a collision occurs and determine 
the cause (interference, faulty tag, hopping pattern error, and so on).
6.3.5  Multivendor Interoperability and Testing
If RFID is to successfully penetrate into large open systems, RFID interoperability 
is a necessity. Not only must tags from any vendor be able to communicate with 
readers from any vendor, but a given tagged object must be able to be identified by 
readers of any user in a wide variety of application conditions. 
Today, RFID systems are primarily composed of systems that may not always 
interoperate due to the mix of RF propagation technologies and information pro-
tocols. The formation of the EPCglobal, a joint venture formed by UCC and EAN, 

224 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
is expected to drive global retailer and manufacturing adoption of RFID technolo-
gies, especially in the supply chain management applications. 
Key to market proliferation of UHF Gen 2-compliant products is the EPCglob-
al program to certify the hardware that implements the standard. This includes the 
testing of tag chips, readers, and printer/encoders with embedded reader modules. 
Products that pass the tests conducted by MET Laboratories (an independent third-
party lab contracted by EPCglobal) earn the EPCglobal certification marks, a seal 
of approval, indicating the products’ adherence to the stringent requirements of the 
standard. EPCglobal has defined three phases of certification:
•• Compliance; 
•• Interoperability; 
•• Performance.
Compliance testing verifies that products comply with the UHF Gen 2 stan-
dard, and products bearing the certification mark are your assurance that they have 
been rigorously tested against EPCglobal standards. Some of the relevant EMC and 
safety standards are the following.
In the United States:
•• U.S. EMC—FCC Rule Part 15 or 90; 
•• Safety—UL 60950 for Tag Interrogators and NRTL Certification.
In Canada:
•• Canada EMC—RSS-210;
•• Safety—CSA 60950 and SCC certification body.
In Europe:
•• Europe EMC testing in accordance to ETSI EN 301 489-1 and ETSI EN 301 
489-3;
•• Radio testing in accordance to ETSI 300-220;
•• Safety testing in accordance to EN 60950; 
•• Declaration of Conformity for CE marking requirements.
FCC recently classified passive RFID chips as unintentional radiators. This im-
plies that passive RFID chips are exempt from the same clearance tests as other 
technical devices with electromagnetic fields.
Interoperability testing builds on the compliance certification and verifies the 
ability of different compliance-certified Gen 2 components to work together. De-
spite the obvious advantages of assuring interoperability among products, not all 
RFID vendors have been able to achieve this level of certification.
Clearly, certified UHF Gen 2 interoperability is a major milestone in the devel-
opment of RFID systems. As important as that is, though, performance is still what 

6.3  Testing and Conformance 
225
matters most to RFID deployments. RFID hardware must have a high degree of 
receptivity, meaning both tags and readers are not only extremely sensitive to each 
other’s signals, they are also able to reject the interference from other RF sources 
operating in the area. EPCglobal, recognizing the critical importance of receptivity 
to system performance, created a working group to address these and other issues. 
In the process of defining minimum requirements, they will address not only 
the performance of tags applied to various classes of products, such RF-friendly 
materials as paper, plastic, wood, and so forth, as well as more problematic materi-
als such as liquids and metals. They will also the key aspects of tag performance, 
like sensitivity, interference rejection, orientation, Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), 
and others parameters.
The Hardware Action Group (HAG) handles the specifications for performance 
testing and thus completing the UHF Gen 2 standard. The group is specifically 
chartered to address conformance and interoperability work for the UHF Gen2 
conformance document and any future UHF work, conformance and interoper-
ability work to for HF, and conformance and interoperability work for any other 
air interface specifications that may be developed in the HAG.
Although all products submitted to interoperability testing must first be certi-
fied for compliance to the Gen 2 standard, it is not uncommon for some manufac-
turers to have misinterpreted certain elements of the specification, preventing their 
tags, for example, operating with other Gen 2 devices. More insidiously, certain 
tags and readers may be interoperable with each other, but not with all other Gen 2 
devices. As such, the scope of interoperability tests should be designed to exercise, 
as much as possible, the full functionality of the Gen 2 spec (including operation 
at timing limits) with a prime objective of assuring true multivendor compatibility.
Interoperability problems between the various industries are on the horizon be-
cause cross-industry requirements usually play a minor role within a given industry. 
However, to fully exploit the technology’s potential, cross-industry standards have 
to ensure interoperability. Therefore, cross-industry consultation is necessary to 
prevent the emergence of different standards from impeding a use of RFID across 
industries.
We have mentioned a few times already that RFID system calculations are just 
a first approximation of the real-world environment. RFID systems do not always 
necessarily work as well as theoretically described or as advertised. This can be due 
to interference in the environment, unforeseen reflections, or simply an installation 
that does not account for the peculiarities of the technology. Theoretical formulas 
and analysis, even computer simulations, may not be always sufficient to represent 
customer environments and predict the RFID system behavior. 
Independent test labs simulating the real customer environment are the answer; 
services offered usually include the identification, evaluation, and integration of 
prototypes, support for middleware and applications, and development of hard-
ware including antennae and tags. These labs will allow companies to test RFID 
systems in real customer environments and iron out any potential problems. In ad-
dition, to ensure that different scenarios can be tested at the center, some of these 
labs have built prototypes for a number of industries, including pharmaceuticals, 
retail, logistics, manufacturing, electronics, government, and transportation.

RFID System Design Considerations
6.4  Review Questions and Problems
1.	 RFID tag may be used in situations where tagged objects like pallets or 
boxes travel on a conveyor belt at speeds up to either 10 feet/second (3.048 
m/s). The tag spends less time in the read field of RFID reader, meaning 
that a high read rate capability is required. In such cases, the RFID system 
must be carefully planned to ensure reliable tag identification. The other 
potential problem could be the Doppler effect. 
	
  Calculate the Doppler shift [using (6.7), where f is transmitting frequen-
cy, Δf is the change in the frequency of the reflected signal, and c is speed 
of light] for this case, at 915 MHz, and check if the operation could be 
affected.
	
f v
f
c
⋅
∆=
	
(6.7)
	
(Answer: The Doppler shift is only around 9 Hz and will not affect the cor-
rect operation of the system.)
2.	 Describe one application of active and passive RFID technology and dis-
cuss and compare the following aspects: range, multitag operation capa-
bilities, data storage, sensor capabilities (temperature, humidity, shock, 
temper detection, security), business process impact, country-specific and 
global standards, and coexistence with other technologies.
3.	 One example of the battery-assisted (semipassive) UHF RFID system one 
that uses 50% duty cycle Manchester encoding for the forward link; this is 
possible because the RF signal does not have to power the tag. The tag is 
designed not for power gathering, but for optimized signal detection. This 
allows much smaller signals to be picked up and amplified on the chip. FSK 
backscatter signaling is using different frequencies to signal a high or low, 
making it easier to discern signal from noise because the reader must only 
find a frequency, not a signal edge.
	
  Discuss the design summary and decide where and when you would use 
this not-all-that-inexpensive system.
4.	 To provide information on otherwise invisible tag detection process, some 
propose the use of a so-called watchdog tag to provide required transpar-
ency. Simply speaking, the watchdog tag is a sophisticated version of an 
ordinary tag, as it features an additional battery, a small screen, and poten-
tially even a long-range communication channel. The watchdog tag’s main 
task is to decode the commands transmitted by a reader and make them 
available on the screen of the device for inspection by the user or to log all 
data transfers and provide consumers with detailed summaries whenever 
needed. 
	
  Although the watchdog tag could be carried by the user as a separate 
device, its functionality could also be integrated into a mobile phone, al-
lowing it to leverage the existing display, battery, memory capacity, and 
long-range communication features of the phone. 

6.4  Review Questions and Problems 
227
	
  How much complexity would this additional feature add to reader-tag 
protocols? Would the read speed and the number of tags read be affected? 
What are your thoughts on usefulness of the watchdog tags?
5.	 A reasonable definition of privacy is necessary to consider various policy 
choices. However, privacy is a notoriously difficult concept to define. The 
United Nations in Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 12, 
codifies that “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his 
privacy” as a basic human right. It has even been suggested that “all human 
rights are aspects of privacy” [13]. In 1890, Supreme Court Justice Louis 
Brandeis famously articulated privacy as the “right to be left alone.” Ruth 
Gavison of the Yale Law Journal defined three core aspects to privacy: se-
crecy, anonymity, and solitude. 
	
  Considering these issues, Simson Garfinkel has written an “RFID Bill of 
Rights” based on the U.S. Department of Health and Education’s Code of 
Fair Information Practices. Garfinkel’s bill of rights reads as follows:
	
Users of RFID systems and purchasers of products containing RFID tags 
have:
	
a.	 The right to know if a product contains an RFID tag;
	
b.	 The right to have embedded RFID tags removed, deactivated or  
	
destroyed when a product is purchased;
	
c.	 The right to first class RFID alternatives: consumers should not lose  
	
other rights (e.g., the right to return a product or to travel on a  
	
particular road) if they decide to opt-out of RFID or exercise a RFID  
	
tag’s “kill” feature;
	
d.	 The right to know what information is stored inside their RFID tags and  
	
what information is associated with those tags in associated databases.  
	
If this information is incorrect, there must be a way to correct or amend  
	
it.
	
e.	 The right to know when, where and why an RFID tag is being read.”
	
  Which one of these rights will be most difficult to implement and why? 
List these rights from the most important towards the least important ones. 
Do you agree with all of them? Add a few other requirements/rights that 
are important for you and the society in which you are living.
6.	 In operating outside the allocated spectrum, in many jurisdictions it may be 
possible to obtain special permission from the regulators of the radio spec-
trum to use equipment that operates outside the prevailing legislation. For 
example, the testing and development of new forms of RFID equipment or 
the temporary use of noncompliant RFID equipment may be allowable on 
a case-by-case basis. 
	
  A large number of factors will typically be taken into account under 
such circumstances, for example, the location of the equipment to be de-
ployed, the potential for interference with legitimate users of the spectrum, 
and so forth. This approach has been used by some companies in Europe 
wishing to start their RFID trials with equipment conforming to North 
American legislation. In these cases, the anticipated use of the noncompli-

228 
���������������������������������
RFID System Design Considerations
ant equipment is for a limited period and operation of the equipment has 
been modified to minimize the chance of it causing interference.
	
  Assume that you are working as an RFID system designer for a large 
company that would like to test and potentially implement a newly de-
signed RFID system in a frequency band that was not originally allocated 
to RFID. What kind of approvals and licenses would you require in the 
area in which you are living? Where would you start your regulatory bat-
tle to implement nonstandardized system? What would happen if you de-
cide next year to open warehouses in another country and want to use the 
same RFID system over there? Is international harmonization a good idea? 
Could international harmonization slow down or expedite your company’s 
project? Discuss the answers to these questions in detail.
7.	 Item management includes both the identification of an item and its loca-
tion. Whereas RFID provides a means of radio identification, RTLS pro-
vides a means of radio location. RTLS is being applied in a number of 
industries, ranging from health care to manufacturing. RTLS has an impor-
tant role to play as far as real-time data is concerned and where assets are 
required to be located in transit. 
	
  According to an analysis, it is expected that the revenue generated by 
RTLS will increase steadily. The shortcomings in the existing systems have 
initiated the need for RTLS. The ability to generate real-time data is the 
major driver behind RTLS.
	
a.	 What type of RFID system would you use for the application shown in  
		
Figure 6.10? What other components of the network are required to  
		
make the system work? Discuss the project.
	
b.	 Condition monitoring is another valuable function that can be added  
		
to supply chain or asset management applications. Temperature,  
Figure 6.10  Satellite/RFID system for tracking of the transported goods.

6.4  Review Questions and Problems 
229
		
humidity, access, and use of assets can be monitored. Discuss adding  
		
condition monitoring to the previous project of the location monitoring.
8.	 One priority for RFID use is hardware certification since RFID interoper-
ability is a condition for successful open applications. Tags from any ven-
dor must communicate with readers from any vendor, and tagged objects 
must be readable in a variety of application conditions. Discuss the RFID 
certification process in the country in which you are living.
9.	 The EU’s Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE 
2002/96/EC Directive) does not explicitly rule out the possibility that RFID 
chips will be seen as waste electrical and electronic equipment. With RFID 
technology becoming increasingly more widely adopted, do you think that 
RFID chips should be treated as dangerous material? Does the size of RFID 
chips play role in making that decision? Should active tags be discarded 
differently than passive tags?
10.	It has been said that the real-time identification and location facilitate 
tracking, effective tracking improves communication, and better communi-
cation is necessary to streamline and coordinate workflow which is a goal 
of every organization, including a health care organization. Application 
of RFID will enable the better analysis and improvement of its operations 
both in real time and long term. Where do you see the application of RFID 
in health care being useful and where, in your personal opinion, should 
society be apprehensive and careful about it?

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
Many organizations, including health organizations, are adopting RFID technolo-
gies as part of their information supply chains for the myriad benefits that come 
through the use of such devices. Today RFID is not just for supply chain applica-
tions anymore, and significant investment has gone into making the technology 
simple, practical, and cost-efficient, especially in embedded applications. A conflict-
ing set of challenges that manufacturers continually face is how to increase safety 
and revenue while decreasing costs. 
In health care challenges include making sure that health care providers have 
the right products at the right place at the right time and avoiding overstocking, 
spoilage, and shrinkage. Another problem is how to protect authentic disposables 
against counterfeits and the resulting threats to diagnosis/treatment reliability and 
eroded recurring revenues. In addition, they have to continually improve the qual-
ity of patient care through better process reliability and proper device configura-
tion to drive brand equity, increase revenue, and minimize legal liability.
Embedded RFIDs1 now enable medical and health care solutions through sup-
porting applications such as inventory management, disposables authentication 
and configuration, and patient management.
This chapter will focus on a completely different area of RFID applications: 
their integration with sensor networks and utilization for the medical implants. In-
body implants and/or on-body sensors are already allowing hearing for the deaf, 
sight for the blind, and mobility for the disabled. Implants can stimulate muscles 
or nerves in response to movement detected by sensors elsewhere on the body, al-
lowing a paralyzed patient to walk again. Similarly, a radio-controlled valve for the 
urinary tract is in development that will be operated on demand to restore bladder 
control.
Section 2.5 provided a useful introduction into the WBANs and applications 
of wireless technologies in the health industry, with a brief overview of the most 
important standards. There are a number of other medical applications of implant-
able medical devices and sensors, so here we will take a brief look at their principles 
of operation. Technical and ethical (especially in the case of neural implants) chal-
lenges will be addressed as well.

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
7.1  Integrating RFIDs and Sensor Networks
Only a small part of all RFIDs are directly used in (simpler) medical applications, 
some of which were described earlier in Chapter 2. Examples are tracking patients, 
tracking medical supplies, and so on. At the same time, many of the same technolo-
gies and same principles are used both in commercial RFIDs and some more sophis-
ticated medical applications, such as wireless body implants. By combining RFID 
principles of operation and sensor and wireless sensor networks, the foundations 
for more sophisticated WBANs have been created (see Figure 7.1). Sensor networks 
were covered in more detail in Section 3.4.
Both near-field and far-field operations are used in commercial RFIDs and also 
in their medical counterparts. In addition, they share some of the same require-
ments and constraint: small size, long-lasting power supply, RF propagation chal-
lenges, and so forth. 
Of course, wireless principles used in medical applications bring a whole new 
set of challenges, such as requirements for increased reliability, biocompatibility, 
no harm to patient, ethical dilemmas, and so forth, that have to be discussed and 
resolved. This chapter will focus on some of the issues specific to the medical ap-
plications of wireless principles and RFIDs. 
It is important to keep in mind that this technology is still very young and will 
require many years of development until its widespread application in the health/
medical world.
7.1.1  Basics of Biomedical Signals
Signals received from a biological or medical source are called biomedical signals 
(or biosignals for short), and their source can be at the molecular level, cell level, or 
systemic or organ level. 
Examples include the Electrocardiogram (ECG), or electrical activity from the 
heart; speech signals; the Electroencephalogram (EEG)2, or electrical activity from 
the brain; evoked potentials (EPs) (i.e., auditory, visual, somatosensory), or electri-
cal responses of the brain to specific peripheral stimulation; the electroneurogram, 
2.	
Discovered by Hans Berger (1873–1941) in 1924, electroencephalography (EEG) is currently one of the 
most commonly utilized methods for the detection and measure of brain activity. Berger first published his 
brainwave results in 1929 as Uber das Elektrenkephalogramm des Menschen, but the English translation 
did not appear until 1969.

or field potentials from local regions in the brain; action potential signals from 
individual neurons or heart cells; the Electromyogram (EMG), or electrical activity 
from the muscle; the electroretinogram from the eye; and so forth.
Typically, biomedical signals are primarily acquired for monitoring specific 
pathological/physiological states for purposes of diagnosis and evaluating therapy. 
In some cases of basic research, they could also be used for the decoding and even-
tual modeling of specific biological systems. 
The monitored biological signal is usually a combination of signal and noise. 
Noise can be any signal that is asynchronous and uncorrelated with the biological 
signal of interest; for example, from instrumentation (sensors, amplifiers, filters), 
from Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), or in general. A Gaussian white noise 
assumption is valid in many biological cases. 
The biomedical signal sources can be broadly classified into continuous pro-
cesses and discrete-time processes. Each of these types of signals could be determin-
istic (or predictable), stochastic (or random), fractal, or chaotic. The continuous 
processes are typically encountered in one of the following situations:
•• Deterministic signals in noise: Examples of this type are ECG or single-fiber 
EMG signals in noise. The measured signal x(t) can be represented as follows:
	
( )
( )
( )
x t
s t
n t
=
+
	
(7.1)
	 where s(t) is the actual deterministic signal and n(t) is the additive noise. 
•• According to the information about biomedical signal processing found in 
[1], deterministic signals could be synchronized to another stimulus signal or 
perturbation in noise. Examples of this type include all the different evoked 
responses (auditory, somatosensory,3 visual) and event-related potentials re-
corded in response to controlled stimuli administered to the body (or any 
biological system in general). These signals usually reveal functional charac-
teristics of specific pathways in the body. 
•• Stochastic or random signals: Examples of this type include EEGs, EMGs, 
and field potentials from the brain. Random signals lack the morphology of 
the signals found in the preceding two categories. Depending on the underly-
ing physiology, the stochastic biosignals could be stationary where statistics 
of the signal do not change with time, or nonstationary (fluctuations in the 
signal statistics due to physiological perturbations such as drug infusion or 
pathology or recovery). 
•• Fractal signals: Signals and patterns in general are self-replicating, which 
means that they look similar at different levels of magnification. They are 
therefore scale-invariant. There is evidence to suggest that heart rate variabil-
ity is fractal in nature. The branching of the airway into bronchioles seems to 
have a self-replicating nature that is characteristic of a fractal.
•• Chaotic signals: They are neither periodic nor stochastic, which makes them 
very difficult to describe or predict beyond a short time into the future. The 
3.	
Somatosensory response pertains to sensations received in the skin and deep tissues.

234 
����������������������������������������
RFID Technology for Medical Applications
difficulty in prediction is due to their extreme sensitivity to initial condi-
tions, characteristic of these nonlinear systems. While fractal theory details 
the spatial characteristics of the nonlinear systems, chaos theory describes 
the temporal evolution of the system parameters or the dynamical variables. 
•• Multichannel signals: They include signals of any of the listed types but that 
were acquired using multichannel recording technology. The goals of sig-
nal analysis are usually to identify correlation among different channels, to 
achieve feature extraction under noisy conditions, and to identify underlying 
physiology.
7.1.2  Sensor Networks in Medicine
Telemedicine is the generic term describing application of telecommunications to 
provide medical information and services by collecting and processing data from 
human body sensors and wirelessly transmitting them in real time to a central moni-
toring system. The purpose of telemedicine is to provide medical expertise to places 
that, due to their physical distance, do not have access to this kind of competence. 
The biopotential wireless sensor node targets the simultaneous monitoring of 
vital body signs. A sensor is a device that is used to detect a change in physical con-
ditions and chemical compounds; sensors generally have a mechanism attached or 
built into them that make the change in the physical or chemical condition readable 
to the human eye.
A biosensor can be generally defined as a device that consists of a biological 
recognition system, often called a bioreceptor, and a transducer, converting that 
recognition and response into a quantifiable term that can be interpreted [2]. There 
are different kinds of biosensors that are classified on the basis of their interaction 
with the biological system: noninvasive biosensors, indwelling biosensors, and in-
vasive biosensors. 
Noninvasive biosensors (also called wearable sensors) can be placed on the sur-
face of the body. Indwelling biosensors can be placed in body cavities or under the 
skin without causing many changes in the body. Invasive biosensors are surgically 
placed in the human body. These sensors have a long battery life and are encapsu-
lated in materials which are not harmful to the individual. All of these sensors vary 
in physical configuration, connection with body organs, packaging, user interface, 
and power supply in accordance with their function. 
Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are being used for the treatment of various 
diseases. IMDs use wireless biomedical sensors as an interface between electronic 
instrumentation and the human body. These sensors take information from the bio-
logical system and transfer it to an external system for monitoring, thus integrating 
wireless communication, sensing, and computing. 
A sensor network is designed to detect events or phenomena, collect and pro-
cess data, and transmit sensed information to interested users. Generally speaking, 
basic features of sensor networks are:
•• Dense deployment and cooperative effort of sensor nodes;
•• Short-range communication and multihop routing;

7.1  Integrating RFIDs and Sensor Networks 
235
•• Self-organizing capabilities;
•• Frequently changing topology due to fading and node failures;
•• Limitations in transmit power, memory, and computing power.
A WBAN intended for medical applications could be seen as a wireless sensor 
network since most medical applications will rely on sensors collecting data about 
(e.g., the heart and the brain). As such, the sensor nodes must be kept simple in 
order to fulfill requirements on energy-efficiency and long battery lifetime. The 
wireless sensors’ networks require efficient hardware, software, signal-processing 
algorithms, and network protocols for operation. 
New challenges will follow the migration of biosensor technology from in vitro 
(procedure performed not on a living organism but in a controlled environment) 
to in vivo (experimentation using a living organism). In a BAN with limited band-
width and power constraints, the conventional method of data acquisition and 
analog-to-digital data conversion with signal processing taking place after trans-
mission is no longer optimal, so the local processing will typically take place at the 
sensor front end before transmission. 
The challenge is to develop low-power communication with low-cost on-node 
processing and self-organizing connectivity/protocols; another critical challenge is 
the need for extended temporal operation of the sensing node despite a limited 
power supply and/or battery life. To conserve energy, the sensor node should be 
kept as long as possible in power-down or sleep mode [3]. 
Power efficiency in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is generally accomplished 
in three ways: by low-duty-cycle operation (i.e., the active time period of the sensor 
node), local in-network processing to reduce data volume and hence transmission 
time, and multihop networking. In addition, the node communication protocols 
should be kept simple not requiring a lot of computation, and also more advanced 
data/signal processing should be avoided in the sensor node. In particular, the ar-
chitecture of the radio, including the use of low-power circuitry, must be properly 
selected, meaning that the low power consumption for transmission over low-
bandwidth channels.
The new practical solutions include an application of energy scavenging in the 
powering of BAN devices. Body-powered applications, however, remain a great 
challenge because of the low specific power levels at low frequencies; therefore, 
substantial progress will be required in reducing power requirements before such 
solutions become feasible, particularly for wireless data transmission. 
If every sensor can transmit directly (i.e., in a single hop) to the hub, then the 
network can have the star topology. However, a single sensor cannot always com-
municate directly to the hub because of the energy and power constrained nature of 
the sensors and because of the multipath fading and shadowing effects. 
Multihop routing is a traditional wireless communication approach to this 
problem, passing the message to the node that is in the optimal position to transmit 
to the hub device. Multihop networking reduces the requirement for long-range 
transmission since signal path loss is an inverse exponent with range or distance. 
Each node in the sensor network can act as a repeater, thereby reducing the link 
range coverage required and, in turn, the transmission power [4].

7.1.3  Medical Implants
Medical implants are not a novelty. They are used in nearly every organ of the hu-
man body, and more than 1,800 types of medical devices are currently in use. Some 
of them have been used for decades. These vary from heart valves, pacemakers, and 
cochlear implants to drug infusion devices and neurostimulating devices for pain 
relief or to combat certain disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. 
What is different and new today is that increasingly more of those implants 
contain some kind of built-in intelligence and a capability to communicate and 
exchange information with the environment.
Generally, IMDs can be divided into two major groups: 
•• Sensory aids (retinal implants, cochlear implants, and so forth);
•• Assessment and treatment devices (implantable biomedical sensors and im-
plantable medical treatment devices).
Monitoring body functions is an essential tool in medical diagnosis, for ex-
ample, repeated measurement of blood pressure at short intervals is mandatory 
for some diseases. Continuous monitoring can be achieved by on-body or in-body 
medical devices. Medical devices are defined as any product that is used to treat 
patients or as a diagnostic tool; they may be external or implanted and reusable or 
disposable. 
In United States, the FDA regulates medical devices according to specific defini-
tions, classifications, requirements, codes, and standards. The FDA’s authority and 
framework for medical device regulation are specified in the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA). For purposes of medical device regulation, 
several acts of Congress amending the FDCA are especially significant: the Medi-
cal Device Amendments of 1976, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, the Food 
and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, and the Medical Device and 
User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 [5].
Two examples of implants, implantable camera pill and cardiac pacer, are 
shown in Figure 7.2.
The Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is based on a large, vitamin pill–size 
capsule that captures the images of the digestive tract, while it is transported pas-
sively by peristalsis (Figure 7.3).
The device consists of an image sensor, an illumination module, an RF trans-
mitter, and a battery. The patient swallows the capsule, and the camera takes and 
transmits about two images per second as it travels through the gastrointestinal 
(GI) tract. A camera sends images to a recorder that the patient wears on a belt 
[6]. These images are stored on the recording device and later downloaded onto a 
computer for viewing by the physician. 
Wireless inductive coupling has been used to communicate between the pace-
maker and a wearable reader outside the patient. The new technology using Blue-
tooth or MICS can provide a simple interface with the patient, where the informa-
tion can be accessed by mobile phone or interface Internet to connect the patient.
Microsystems include microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, 
and microarrays and have diverse medical applications, for example, biosensors 
and detectors to detect trace quantities of bacteria, airborne pathogens, biological

hazards, and disease signatures; microfluidic applications for DNA testing and im-
plantable fluid injection systems; and MEMS devices that contain miniature mov-
ing parts for heart pacemakers and surgical devices [7].

7.1.3.1  Sensory Aids for Hearing and Visual Loss
Loss of hearing is very common and approximately one person in a 1,000 is born 
deaf worldwide. Almost an equal number of people born with hearing will develop 
deafness during their lifetime. 
Patients with severe hearing loss typically have absent or malfunctioning sen-
sory cells in the cochlea. In a normal ear, sound energy is converted to mechanical 
energy by the middle ear, which is then converted to mechanical fluid motion in 
the cochlea. Within the cochlea, the inner and outer ear sensory cells are sensitive 
transducers that convert mechanical fluid motion into electrical impulses in the 
auditory nerve.
Cochlear implants4 are the substitute for the function of the middle ear, co-
chlear mechanical motion, and sensory cells. The implants transform sound energy 
into electrical energy that will initiate impulses in the auditory nerve. 
Today one of the highly active areas of research is the development of visual 
prosthesis. Visual prosthesis necessitates the development of sensors, very large-
scale integration circuitry, power delivery, telemetry, and advance packing and tis-
sue interfaces. Some degenerative diseases of the retina, such as retinitis pigmen-
tosa5 or age-related macular degeneration, could severely decrease night vision and 
can progress to diminishing peripheral vision and blindness. 
In cases where the neural wiring from the eye to the brain is still intact but 
the eyes lack photoreceptor activity, photoreceptor loss could be compensated by 
bridging or bypassing the destroyed photoreceptors and artificially stimulating the 
adjacent intact cells. These artificially generated impulses will reach the brain and 
produce visual perception, thereby restoring some (elementary) vision.
Partial restoration of visual function (e.g., facial recognition or navigation 
through a building) involves the development of implantable retinal prosthesis de-
vices with sophisticated image processing and neural interfaces [8].
One approach being developed by various groups including a project at Ar-
gonne National Laboratory is an artificial retina implanted in the back of the pa-
tient’s own retina; the artificial retina uses a miniature video camera attached to 
eyeglasses in order to capture visual signals. The signals are processed by a micro-
computer worn on the belt and transmitted to an array of electrodes placed in the 
eye, stimulating optical nerves, which then carry a signal to the brain. 
A different approach uses a subretinal implant designed to replace photorecep-
tors in the retina [9]. The visual system is activated when the membrane potential 
of overlying neurons is altered by current generated by the implant in response to 
light stimulation. The implant uses a microelectrode array powered by 3,500 mi-
croscopic solar cells. 
4.	
Cochlear implants cannot restore hearing to normal, but it can give the sensation of sounds; they work well 
for adults and children who have lost their hearing after acquiring spoken language and for young children 
who were born deaf.
5.	
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of genetic eye conditions that leads to incurable blindness due to a 
progressive loss of photoreceptors. In the progression of symptoms for RP, night blindness generally pre-
cedes tunnel vision (reduction of the peripheral visual field) by years or even decades.

7.1  Integrating RFIDs and Sensor Networks 
239
7.1.3.2  Implantable Assessment and Treatment Devices
Nanotechnology6 is the analysis, understanding, and manipulation of matter at 
structure sizes from 0.1 to 100 nm, offering sensing technologies that provide more 
accurate and timely medical information for diagnosing disease and miniature de-
vices that can administer treatment automatically if required. Microsensors and 
nanosensors can make use of a wide range of technologies that detect a targeted 
chemical or physical property. 
One can also look at biomedical sensors from the standpoint of how they are 
applied to the patient or research subject. General approaches to attaching bio-
medical sensors are as follows:
•• Noninvasive (noncontacting and skin surface or contacting);
•• Invasive (indwelling or minimally invasive and implanted).
Clearly, if a measurement can be made equally well by a sensor that does not 
contact the subject being measured or by one that must be surgically implanted, 
the former is by far the most desirable. However, a sensor that is used to provide 
information to help control a device surgically placed in the body to replace or as-
sist a failing organ should be implanted, since this is the best way to communicate 
with the internal device.
Some types of implantable sensors use MEMS devices and accelerometers for 
monitoring and treatment of paralyzed limbs. With Functional Electrical Stimula-
tion (FES) therapy, a patient uses an external device to wirelessly communicate 
with several implanted and on-body devices. By stimulating several muscles and 
nerves in sequence, a paralyzed patient can stand and even walk a few steps. 
Implantable sensors can also work with a series of medical devices that ad-
minister treatment automatically if required. Tiny implantable fluid injection sys-
tems can dispense drugs electrically on demand making use of microfluidic systems, 
miniature pumps, and reservoirs. Initial applications may include chemotherapy 
that directly targets tumors in the colon and are programmed to dispense precise 
amounts of medication at convenient times, such as after a patient has fallen asleep. 
Lupus, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS applications are also being investigated. 
For example, the awarded patent in 2006 is the first out of 10 pending pat-
ents by Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc. (ISSYS) for its MEMS technology for safe, 
chronic, fast, detailed, real-time, continuous, biopressure measurements. The par-
ticular targets of ISSYS products are cardiovascular disease, especially congestive 
heart failure, and hydrocephalus (high brain pressure) disease. The U.S. Patent 
Office has granted a patent entitled “Implantable Sensing Device for Physiologic 
Parameter Measurement” (U.S. Patent No. 6,968,743), which covers the design, 
6.	
Triggered by recent discoveries in the area of nanomaterials, nanoelectronics has shown the potential to 
introduce a new approach in electronic devices and system design. Since many nanoscale materials and de-
vices exhibit their most interesting properties at RF, nanotechnology has entered the microwave engineer-
ing research arena. In the future, nanotechnology-based innovation may be utilized in the different areas 
of RF system miniaturization and diversification, energy-efficient RFID devices, and even in the extended 
sensing and cognitive functionalities.

fabrication, and manufacturing of miniature, wireless, batteryless, implantable sen-
sors [10].
While sensors themselves may be neutral, the service supplied and the data 
gathered may give rise to ethical concerns. For example, the same type of sensors 
used to monitor a forest fire could also be employed on the opposite side of a wall 
to observe a person’s activities based on body heat. The U.S. Supreme Court has 
barred law enforcement officials from using this form of technology in Kyllo vs. 
United States in 2001 [11]. 
7.2  Operational Challenges of Implanted Devices
Some of the challenges that WBANs are facing in health applications are the devel-
opment of better sensors, improving wireless networks, correctly using the infor-
mation, demonstrating that this technology reduces cost and improves patient care, 
and making sure that the privacy of the end user is guaranteed and that technology 
is used in the highly ethical manner. 
The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) claims that 
scientists and ethicists should weigh the impacts of human enhancements, such as, 
among others, steroid use by athletes, implanted devices for treating depression, 
and the possibility of genetic manipulations to prolong human life [12]. 
Some of the challenges faced when deploying wireless-based solutions include 
engineering and quality issues, social issues, and patients’ well-being issues. An 
implementation-related challenge is interoperability among various devices, as well 
as devices in different countries. 
For patients, an important issue is how the quality of their life will be affected 
by using these new applications, so designing applications that can be useful while 
unobtrusive is another challenge for wireless networks-based application/solution 
developers. 
Some of the main challenges related to the use of wireless devices definitively 
include security, privacy, and the learning curve for new technologies. Ensuring 
patients’ information security, combined with the privacy of user data over wireless 
channels, can be a major challenge. 
Wireless-based medical devices can be very limited in terms of power availabil-
ity and processing strength. With the new technologies surrounding us in our daily 
lives, new users can find it challenging to use these more sophisticated devices to 
the fullest. Thus, it can be an issue and a challenge for engineers to create some of 
the best solutions without forcing the users to make unnecessary effort just to learn 
how to use them.

ing tissue. Smaller implantable devices with nonintrusive or minimally-intrusive

systems will likely contain nanoscale materials and smaller systems approaching 
the nanoscale7.
Many biological systems are designed to deal with foreign materials by trying 
to eliminate them. The rejection reaction that is often discussed with regard to im-
planted materials or transplanted tissues is an example of this. Thus, in considering 
biomedical sensors, the main concern is the rejection phenomenon and the way it 
will affect the performance of the sensor. If the rejection phenomenon changes the 
local biology around the sensor, this can result in the sensor measuring phenomena 
associated with the reaction that it has produced as opposed to phenomena charac-
teristic of the biologic system being studied [13].
On the other hand, biologic systems can also affect sensor performance, es-
pecially indwelling and implanted sensors. The body generates a hostile corrosive 
environment to most materials that are commonly available since body fluids are 
largely composed of salt water. Thus, the sensor package must not only protect the 
sensor from the corrosive environment of the body, but it must allow that portion 
of the sensor that performs the actual measurement to communicate with the bio-
logic system (human body in this case). 
Despite recent development in biomedical field, the current state-of-the-art 
prosthetic platforms still lack reliable and convenient packaging methods to in-
tegrate high-density signal-driving chips, wireless telemetry circuitries, and noise-
canceling amplifiers. A useful discussion on the present challenges of retinal im-
plants and a description of the potentially new packaging technology is presented 
in [14]. 
Due to the limited access to implanted devices, sensors and electronics have to 
be highly reliable so that there is no need to repair or replace them very often. It is 
also important that these sensors are highly stable, because in most applications it 
is not possible to calibrate the sensor in vivo. Thus, sensors must maintain their cal-
ibration once they are implanted, and for applications such as organ replacement, 
this can represent a potentially long time, the remainder of the patient’s life [15].
Implants should function within the human body with no side effects intro-
duced by the implant’s presence. Any implant containing moving parts (heart-valve 
or hip implant, for example) will almost certainly release wear particles, and unless 
the implant is made of a truly inert material, some corrosion will eventually occur. 
The body has only a limited tolerance for corrosion products and wear particles 
released by an implant; a major problem with orthopedic implants is the release of 
wear particles from the moving surfaces. 
The implant with the highest load capacity is the hip implant (Figure 7.4), giv-
ing users 20 years of service without any maintenance. The longevity of the hip 
implant will depend, of course, on the age and the lifestyle of the patient.
Under the Safe Medical Devices Act (SMDA) issued in 1990, amended by the 
FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) in 1997, and revised in 2008, manufacturers 
are required to track certain medical devices (mostly implantable ones) in the mar-
ketplace, so that the device can be promptly identified and removed in the event of 
a product recall [16].
7.	
While nanodevices are increasingly becoming possible to make in the laboratory, larger-scale microdevices 
are effective solutions in most cases. As a result, nanodevices are more likely to be in future applications 
and will not be discussed here.

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
Each time a biomedical material is inserted in the body, there is a risk that 
bacteria will be introduced into the body on the surface of the biomedical material. 
Even fine metal particles and oxides or hydroxides of metals such as chromium 
and titanium have been observed to cause inflammation, swelling, and possibly 
even cancer in some patients. The enzymes and proteins present in tissue fluids are 
observed to amplify the corrosive nature of the tissue fluids. 
If there is inflammation around the implant, then the implant environment 
becomes even more corrosive because of the secretion of strong oxidants by the 
human cells that initiate the inflammation. It is not sufficient for a material to be 
merely nontoxic; the material should not initiate an immune or inflammatory re-
sponse from the human body nor should it function as a protected niche for bacte-
rial infections. 
Medical implants are being used in every organ of the human body, and, ide-
ally, they should have biomechanical properties comparable to those of real tissues 
and without any adverse effects. Whenever a biomedical material is inserted in the 
body, adsorbed8 proteins will almost inevitably cover this material. In some cases, 
this protein adsorption may lead to blood clotting, and a lump of clotted blood 
could block an artery, causing a thrombosis [17].
Detailed studies of the long-term effects of medical implants must be under-
taken to accurately determine the performance and safety of the implants. For 
example, from a clinical point of view, it is important to realize that, at least for 
now, the implanted microelectrodes into the brain of patients will only provide a

Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions, biomolecules or molecules of gas, liquid, or dissolved solids to 
a surface.

year or so of operation. The electrodes cause scarring and would be implanted in 
eloquent regions of the cortex; repetitive procedures could have significant detri-
mental effects to the patient’s long-term functional and cognitive status. Invasive 
brain electrodes, therefore, need a prolonged lifespan to warrant the risks of an 
intracranial procedure. 
To date, current single-unit microelectrodes have long-term biocompatibility 
issues leading to limited lifespans; however, there are several groups developing 
new biomaterials as well as slow-release drug delivery systems that could decrease 
encapsulation. Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic member of the glucocorticoid 
class of steroid hormones that acts as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppres-
sant, on the microelectrode might reduce the initial injury response; its potency is 
about 20 to 30 times that of hydrocortisone and four to five times of prednisone. 
Dexamethasone is commonly used in transvenous screw-in cardiac pacing leads to 
minimize the inflammatory response of the myocardium [18].
The ability to predict the long-term in vivo performance of medical implants 
is of vital interest. The extrapolation of in vitro data to the in vivo environment 
remains, in most cases, unproven. Among the major challenges are the limited abil-
ity to simulate the complexities of the biological environment, the current lack of 
reliable computer modeling of in vivo performance characteristics of implants, and 
difficulties in evaluating the synergistic contributions of materials, design features, 
and therapeutic drug regimens.
There has been some concern about the possibility of tumor formation by the 
wide range of materials used in body implants. Although many implant materials 
are carcinogenic in rats, there are few well-documented cases of tumors in humans 
directly related to implants. It may be premature to make final judgment since the 
latency time for tumor formation in humans maybe longer than 20 to 30 years. In 
this case, we have to wait longer for a final assessment. 
However, the number of implants being placed in the body and the lack of 
strong direct evidence for carcinogenicity tend to support the conjecture that car-
cinogenesis is species-specific and that no tumors (or an insignificant number) will 
be formed in humans by the implants.
7.2.2  Radio Propagation Inside the Human Body
While the characteristics of different wireless networking technologies partially 
overlap, some were originally designed with different particular applications in 
mind. Table 7.1 details the common North American and European frequency 
bands that are suitable for certain medical applications. The absence of global ap-
proach is preventing technology of spreading and impeding the use of these devices. 
Good examples of global standardization challenges are the remote controlled 
infusion pumps, operating in the band 902–920 MHz, which is allowed to oper-
ate in North America and Australia/New Zealand, but cannot be used in Europe 
because the band is extensively used for cellular telephony. 
As of the time of this writing, there were no standards for sensor networks or 
WBANs, and one reason for this could be the wide range of application scenarios 
for those networks. A standard needs to have support for as many applications as 
possible, but the result is a more complex and time-consuming document.

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
A study group of the IEEE was launched in November 2007 to work on the 
WBAN9 standardization; the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 6 (BAN) is presently devel-
oping a communication standard optimized for low-power devices and operation 
in regards to the human body (but not limited to humans) to serve a variety of 
applications including medical, consumer electronics/personal entertainment, and 
other [19].
Table 7.2 summarizes features of different technologies considered for WBANs 
and is based on [20]. 
According to [21], the communications between an access point to the back-
bone network are dependent on the application. From the hospital to the back-
bone, IEEE 802.11 WLAN can be employed. Besides WLAN, a traditional PCS/
cellular network can also be used in the home case. IEEE 802.11p Vehicular Ad hoc 
Networks (VANET) or IEEE 802.16e Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access (WIMAX) is proposed for the mobile ambulance case. For the ambulance 
helicopter, IEEE 802.16e WIMAX is a good candidate. 
A good summary of the specifications, output power, frequency bands, and 
international use of several applicable RF wireless technologies can be found in the 
ISO technical report [22].
7.2.2.1  Implanted Wireless Systems
When upgrading medical devices with any kind of wireless connectivity, it is impor-
tant to remember that the communication link quality and data integrity are vital 
if they are used for diagnostics or therapeutics. Even wearable sensor networks 
present problems in terms of managing transmitted power (and therefore distance 
and channel conditions) and power consumption that can dramatically change with 
9.	
Wireless body area networks (WBAN) has emerged as a key technology to provide real-time health moni-
toring of a patient and diagnose many life threatening diseases. WBAN operates in close vicinity to, on, or 
inside a human body and supports a variety of medical and nonmedical applications.

the posture of the body and movements. The topic was covered by Quwaider in his 
article [23]. Much more challenging are medical applications that utilize wireless 
communication with implanted electronic circuits. 
As with all measured quantities, the user must be confident that the data re-
trieved is accurate, requiring the usual techniques of instrument design and calibra-
tion. However, an additional constraint for wireless devices is that the data must 
be secure. Since many devices operate in the license-exempt ISM frequency bands, 
there is a severe risk of interference that could be particularly dangerous in the 
context of a medical device.
Power consumption is another major challenge, especially for medical implants 
in particular, leading to highly optimized solutions for ultralow-power consump-
tion from the implanted battery. From the engineering perspective, power con-
sumption, range, and data rate are opposing design requirements for wireless im-
plants and have to be optimized within the radio regulatory constraints.
In the simple wireless system block diagram, shown in Figure 7.5, the analog 
data from a sensor measurement is first converted from its continuous-time analog 
signal into a discrete-time digital signal. A baseband processor then adds error-de-
tection information and formats the data for transmission, and after that the base-
band data is sent to the transceiver, encoded onto an RF signal and broadcasted by 
the transmitter, detected by the receiver, and finally decoded back into digital data.
The human body is a difficult medium for radio propagation; it is partially con-
ductive and consists of materials of different dielectric constants and characteristic 
impedance. This means that at the interface of two body materials, such as muscle 
and fat, the difference can cause a wave to be partly reflected rather than transmit-
ted. Signal penetration into body tissue is also important. A reduction of signal to 
36% of the peak is an often-used reference, and it can be seen that propagation at 
the certain frequency is about four times better in the fat than in the muscle tissue. 
The cerebrospinal fluid is also highly conductive, and transmitting the RF sig-
nal within the head is similar to transmitting a radio wave through an electrically

shielded room. Such transmission is possible only when the RF signal is strong and 
its frequency is relatively low, which requires more energy consumption [24].
A potential RF performance problem is the placement of the implanted device. 
A surgeon will place an implant where it is required and will be clinically most ef-
fective, with little concern for RF propagation. Therefore, the antenna must oper-
ate effectively from various depths and through layers of fat, muscle, and skin with 
unpredictable thickness. In addition, all these parameters may change with time.
The power limit applies to the signal level outside of the body (environment), 
which allows for implant power levels to be increased compensating for body loss-
es. Once the implant is in place, the RF link can be used to adjust the signal level to 
the highest allowable level. The impedance radiated by the antenna will also vary 
as the patient moves or ages and the location of the implanted device shifts. An au-
tomatic tuning circuit and firmware routine that operates each time the transceiver 
is powered up can compensate for impedance change. 
At low frequencies, electromagnetic energy has significant penetration capabil-
ities, and the body can be used to support communications channels. For example, 
at 10 MHz the penetration depth is about 200 mm (8 inches) for muscle and over 
1m (3 feet) for fat. At 2.45 GHz the depths are 25 mm (1.0 inch) and 120 mm (5 
inches), respectively [25]. Radio propagation through the human body and on the 
body-environment boundary (transition area) has been a topic of intense study and 
discussions for some time.

specified organs and entering the body in noninvasive way, are all being developed 
today. A key element of an RF-linked implant is the in-body antenna, which must 
meet stringent biocompatibility and size-limit requirements. 
Antenna design is a mature scientific and engineering discipline, but all the 
literature on this topic has one thing in common, that is, they mainly describe an-
tennas placed in a nonconducting surrounding with a relative permittivity of 1, or 
close to 1. In other words, they describe antennas placed in vacuum or air. The only 
structure that is typically found close to the antenna is a radome, which is made of 
low loss materials with low permittivity. When the antenna is placed inside a hu-
man body, a completely different situation is created: the antenna is surrounded by 
a lossy material with high permittivity. This is a completely new area of research 
since there are only two instances in classical antenna applications in which similar 
conditions occur: buried antennas and submarine antennas.
When the medical implant is placed with an antenna inside a patient, the an-
tenna will be affected by the immediate surroundings, and, as a result, the antenna 
behaves differently if placed in an arm, deep in the abdomen, or just beneath the 
skin in the chest. In addition to this, there will be a dependency on the surrounding 
tissue type, for example, variations in the subcutaneous fat layer. This layer varies 
in thickness between patients and varies also over time when a patient gains or 
loses weight; therefore, the far field from the antenna is affected by the patient’s 
size, body shape, and position. Movements of the patient change the immediate 
surroundings of the implanted antenna. 
The MICS frequency band, 402–405 MHz, corresponds to a wavelength of 
approximately 30 inches in the air and approximately 4 inches inside the body. 
The body surface is in the near field of the implanted antenna and any change of 
the permittivity or conductivity of materials placed in the near field of an antenna 
changes its radiation characteristics. Thus, a change in posture changes the far-field 
pattern and affects the radio channel between the medical implant and the external 
base station [26].
Unlike free-air performance, the human body is an unpredictable and hostile 
environment for a wireless signal. The human body is a conductive medium repre-
senting a lowpass filter for the electromagnetic waves, and engineers are then often 
forced to use low frequencies or, equivalently, long wavelengths. If the space for 
the antenna is limited, the antenna will be small compared to the wavelength; the 
drawback is that small antennas in high-loss materials consume more power, due 
to the losses in the near zone of the antenna. Hence, the design of the antenna and 
the choice of frequency are delicate problems, where two power loss mechanisms 
with counteracting frequency dependences are involved [27].
Conducting materials, such as metals, act similar to perfect reflectors for UHF 
radiation. Materials such as glass, concrete, and cardboard are effectively RF trans-
parent for waves that are incident upon them with an angle of incidence of 90°, 
but they become less transparent as the angle of incidence becomes more oblique. 
In modeling antenna behavior in the human body, there are two different cases: 
the antenna in an infinite body of lossy matter and the antenna in a finite body of 
lossy matter that is placed in air. The last one follows from the first, if the finite 
body with the internal antenna is treated as one large antenna. At every boundary 
between two materials, electromagnetic waves incident upon that boundary will 

248 
����������������������������������������

be both transmitted from one material to the other and reflected back into the ma-
terial in which they are traveling. 
7.2.2.3  Modeling Human Body
Some materials, such as water, act as both good reflectors of electromagnetic waves 
and good attenuators, or absorbers, of electromagnetic energy. The partial reflec-
tion of a wave results in the energy of the wave being separated to traverse multiple 
paths. The result is that a partial reflection attenuates the partially transmitted wave 
by the amount of energy reflected at the boundary. 
Detailed radio propagation characterization within the human body through 
means of various simulation techniques and measurements was described and sta-
tistical models of the radio channel were derived and shown in [28]. The study 
demonstrated the importance of optimum frequency choice taking into account 
attenuation factors, tissue conductivity, and also antenna size and orientation, 
which not only can affect radiation inside the body but also can determine the 
optimum distance of which good performance can be achieved in the surrounding 
environment. 
Animal organs are sometimes used to characterize and simulate human tissues; 
the animal organs used are sheep liver, heart, and lungs, with the heart possessing 
electric properties close to the stomach dielectric constant and conductivity. In the 
literature [29] there are recipes for tissue-simulating liquids for muscle, brain, lung, 
and bone tissue as well as descriptions of polyacrylamide solutions, which simulate 
fat tissue. 
Until recently, the majority of work that has been done to obtain a detailed 
understanding of radio transmission near the human body has focused on the head 
and neck. Early work used relatively simple body models that assumed that human 
tissue was homogenous, but slowly the research moved to more sophisticated mod-
els [30]. More recently, there have been a number of studies looking at the abdomi-
nal region using detailed models for both female bodies [31] and male bodies [32]. 
Results also show that the higher frequency is attenuated more when propagat-
ing through the body, and thus the lower frequency is better for implants placed 
deeper inside the body. Despite the fact that absorption of electromagnetic radia-
tion increases with frequency, it is found that, up to a point, increasing the frequen-
cy can improve the far-field signal strength from an ingested or implanted source. 
The reason for this is that the size of the capsule device demands that an electrically 
small antenna be used, and that typically the antenna should be smaller than λ/2 
(the preferred size for the simplest radiating device). As a consequence, when the 
frequency is increased, the wavelength decreases towards the antenna dimensions, 
increasing the antenna’s efficiency. 
Table 7.3 lists the conductivities, the dielectric constants, and the penetration 
depths of muscle, fat, bone, and skin tissue at 405 and 650 MHz, based on [33].
The electrical properties of the body tissues are frequency-dependent and 
should be identified for the frequency of interest. The permittivity of a material is 
a function of numerous factors including its constituent materials. For biological 
materials, water is one of the major constituents. It is important to realize when 
making biological measurements that the relative percentage of water in the body 
varies with such things as gender, age, physiologic state, and tissue type [34]. 

7.2  Operational Challenges of Implanted Devices 
249
The formulas for the radiation resistance and reactance assume a medium with 
a complex propagation constant γ = α + jβ, where α and β depend on the electrical 
parameters σ and ε. In addition to the high losses that the transmitted RF wave 
will face, the composition of the biological tissues inside the human body is very 
complex and varies from one person to another. Thus, numerical models, no matter 
how complex, will only be estimates since an accurate solution to the problem of 
wave propagation in the human body is still being developed [35]. 
It has been found that there is a competing effect between the increased effi-
ciency of the antenna and the increasing absorption of the body tissue, so an opti-
mum trade-off frequency is found to be in the region of 650 MHz.
7.2.3  Power Requirements for Implanted Devices
In medical applications, where the diagnostic device is to be implanted inside the 
human body, only limited power is available for the electronic circuits and sensor. 
In such cases, power can only be found via a battery implanted together with the 
sensing system or through passive telemetry. For an implant device with a battery 
life of 7 to 10 years, energy must be carefully conserved, since power consumption 
determines the life of the implant as well as the battery size. 
Energy is mostly consumed during data transmission, so the smaller the trans-
mission range and the slower the data can be sent, the lower the power consump-
tion. A common approach to saving power is to keep the transmitter circuits pow-
ered off when not required and keeping radio circuits in a receive mode when not 
transmitting, but an even more effective technique is to also power-down the re-
ceiver circuits and periodically wake the receiver up to check for an asynchronous 
transmit request. The receive section is duty-cycled on and off in less than 100 µs, 
which makes it possible to achieve very low average power consumption while 
monitoring the MICS channel for transmitted messages. When on, the receiver 
checks to see if a signal is present and if a strong enough signal is located, the entire 
receive section can be quickly powered up to obtain data. The technique heavily 
depends on a rapid-start oscillator that can wake up the receiver and (if needed) the 
transmitter in an extremely short time [36].

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
Many receivers are using two independent receive channels (diversity) to boost 
the reception range and improve the reliability of MICS transmissions. More so-
phisticated transceivers also contain baseband Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) 
circuits that postprocess the demodulated incoming data stream to produce both a 
sampled data bit stream and a clock signal. That process helps improve transmis-
sion reliability by synchronizing the data processing clock with the incoming data 
and the result is less power wasted with retransmissions. 
There have been a number of research projects over the last few years dedicated 
to these alternative (and sometimes unusual) sources of energy with the potential to 
power RFID and WBAN devices and networks, described in [37, 38]. For example, 
University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering and College of Ag-
riculture and Natural Resources is harnessing and exploiting the “self-renewing” 
and “self-assembling” properties of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) to build a new 
generation of small, powerful, and highly efficient batteries and fuel cells.
In medical devices, for example, a patient’s normal daily activities could power 
an implantable pump that delivers insulin to a diabetic. The use of piezoelectric 
materials to harvest power has already become popular since they have the ability 
to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge; for example, they can 
also be embedded in shoes to recover “walking energy.” A new and more efficient 
piezoelectric energy harvester without rectifying diodes principle is described in 
[39].
In passive telemetry, energy may be harvested from a remote electromagnetic 
field transmitted outside the body. The same field may also be used to receive 
control data and transmit sensor data. Passive RFID tags obtain impinging energy 
during reader interrogation periods, and this energy is used to power tag IC. In the 
near field, tag to reader communication is achieved by modulating the impedance 
(load modulation) of the tag as seen by the reader [40]. 
The other solution is the so-called far-field energy harvesting that utilizes the 
energy from the interrogation signal’s far-field signal to power the tag. In the far 
field, tag-to-reader communication is achieved by modulating the RCS of the tag 
antenna (i.e., backscatter modulation).
Electromagnetic power can also be delivered through skin [41], allowing im-
planted devices to be powered indefinitely. However, such a scheme requires an ex-
ternal transmitting device to deliver EM energy continuously, or to recharge a bat-
tery. A novel power supply for implantable biosensors has been described by Goto 
et al. [42]. In this power supply, Near Infrared (NIR) light transmission recharges 
a lithium secondary battery wirelessly through the skin. The Sun is a good source 
of NIR light, and its use requires no other external device to deliver energy to the 
recharging system. A photovoltaic cell array and the rectifier using Schottky diodes 
implanted beneath the skin can receive NIR light through the skin, and charge the 
battery that is directly powering an implanted biosensor(s).
A new approach to reduction of power consumption and miniaturization is 
to create a small network of sensors within the body; all the sensors are wirelessly 
communicating with the central unit, which, in turn, communicates with the ex-
ternal signal processing unit. In [43] authors describe an Intra-brain Communica-
tion (IBCOM), a wireless signal transmission method that uses the brain itself as a 
conductive medium to transmit the data and commands between neural implants 
and data processing systems outside the brain. The concept was validated through 

7.3  Development of Medical Devices

a series of experiments on rat brain. More details regarding powering RFID tags 
were given in Section 5.5.
7.3  Development of Medical Devices
7.3.1  Technology Transfer
Technology transfer is the communication of information from research and devel-
opment to the users or vice versa. Technology transfer also occurs when an innova-
tion is transferred to another application as an idea, prototype, or useful product. 
There are many examples of technology transfer such as applications that began 
as military or space exploration (Teflon comes to mind) and later became commer-
cial products. Medical technologies usually develop as a result of breakthroughs in 
other disciplines but also medical technologies can also transfer to other nonmedi-
cal and/or commercial applications. 
The development of computed tomography (CT)10 scans in 1970s is an ex-
ample of a medical technology that now has a variety of other uses. The imaging 
techniques essential in many of the sensing technologies carry over into areas of 
fine art, drawing, and photography, for example. Technology that is not successful 
in medicine may prove successful elsewhere and vice versa. Figure 7.6 graphically 
depicts this process. 
As described in [44], cognitive neuroscience combines experimental strategies 
of cognitive psychology with various techniques to find correlation between brain 
functions and mental activities. Sometimes technology can be used for purposes for 
which it was never intended. For example, the development of functional neuroim-
aging (fMRI)11 has brought many ethical issues. While some of these ethical issues 
are typical bioethical issues, including safety (e.g., for scans involving radiation or 
high magnetic field strengths) and researchers’ obligations when incidental findings 
of abnormal brain structure or function are observed in research scans, others arise 
from the ability to correlate brain activity with psychological and mental states.
One of the most widely discussed new applications of functional neuroimaging 
is based on correlations between brain activity and intentional deception (lying) 
[45]. All lie detection methods, like all human cognitive behavior, have their roots 
in neuroscience. The most common and commonly used lie detector, the polygraph, 
does not measure directly activity in the subject’s brain. From its invention around 
1920, the polygraph has measured physiological indications that are associated 
with the mental state of anxiety: blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and 
galvanic skin response (sweating).
10.	 CT is a medical imaging method employing tomography created by computer processing. Digital geometry 
processing is used to generate a 3-D image of the inside of an object from a large series of 2-D X-ray images 
taken around a single axis of rotation.
11.	 Functional MRI (fMRI) uses MRI technology to measure blood flow in the live brain, which corresponds 
with activity in the brain [blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals]. fMRI dominates the brain 
mapping field due to its relatively low invasiveness, absence of radiation exposure, and relatively wide 
availability.

252 
����������������������������������������
RFID Technology for Medical Applications
The term neuroscience-based lie detection describes newer methods of lie de-
tection that try to detect deception based on information about activity in a sub-
ject’s brain. In spite of the lack of convincing proof of efficacy, some companies in 
the United States, due to the lack of regulations, are able to offer fMRI-based lie 
detection services. 
7.3.2  Medical Product Development
A hazard is a potential source of harm, and in order to minimize use-related haz-
ards, to assure that intended users are able to use medical devices safely and ef-
fectively throughout the product life cycle, and to facilitate review of new device 
submissions and design control documentation, a thorough understanding of the 
medical device is required [46]. 
For the safe and effective use of the medical device, the user, the device, and 
the environment have to be closely examined12. ISO 14155 standard defines pro-
cedures for conducting clinical investigations of medical devices that will protect 
human subjects, ensure proper scientific conduct in the clinical investigation, and 
12.	 Regulations for conducting medical device clinical trials around the world can vary widely. A medical de-
vice clinical trial can cost between $5 and $10 million in the United States or Western Europe and more in 
Japan. The cost of the same trial conducted in Eastern Europe will be considerably lower, and due to the 
relaxed or even nonexistent regulations in India, China, or Korea, it may be 10 times cheaper.

assist sponsors, monitors, investigators, ethics committees, regulatory authorities, 
and bodies involved in assessing medical device conformity. 
ISO 14155 helps assure that data generated anywhere in the world meets mini-
mum standards of quality for study design, planning, conduct, documentation and 
human subject protections [47] and it consists of two parts: ISO 14155-1:2003 
Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects—Part 1: General 
Requirements and Part 2: Clinical Investigation Plans.
When used as intended, the medical device should work perfectly well; the 
question is what happens when the device is in the different environment and/or 
used in an incorrect or different way than for what it was designed. Many of these 
and similar issues can be addressed through a risk analysis during the design stage, 
but in most cases not all potential situations could be predicted and/or accounted 
for [48]. 
In addition to the functional assessment, the ethical evaluation of implantable 
devices is required to assess, at the minimum, the following areas of concern: issues 
of safety and informed consent, issues of manufacturing and scientific responsibil-
ity, anxieties about the psychological impacts of enhancing human nature, worries 
about possible usage in children, and issues of privacy and autonomy. As is the case 
in evaluation of any future technology, the reliable prediction of all the effects is 
not possible; nevertheless, the potential for harm must be considered through risk 
analysis.
Medical devices (MDs) are subject to the general controls of the Federal Food 
Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) Act which are contained in the final procedural regula-
tions in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 800-1200 (21 CFR Parts 800—
1299). These controls represent the baseline requirements that apply to all medical 
devices necessary for marketing, proper labeling, and monitoring its performance 
once the device is on the market [49]. 
As described on the FDA’s Web site [50], the three-step process for obtaining 
marketing clearance from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), 
are:
•• Step 1 is making sure that the product is indeed a medical device. It could also 
be an electronic radiation emitting product with additional requirements.
•• Step 2 is a determination of how the FDA may classify the device: into which 
one of the three classes the device may fall. 
•• Step 3 is a development and/or collection of data and/or information nec-
essary to submit a marketing application and to obtain FDA clearance to 
market. 
In the EU, the first step in launching of an MD is to obtain the CE mark-
ing. The MD, active implantable medical devices (AIMD), and in vitro diagnostic 
medical devices (IVDMD) market is based on a European regulatory framework 
governed by three directives, 90/385/CEE for AIMD, 98/79/CEE for IVDMD, and 
93/42/CEE for the others, the so-called new approach. These specify that MDs and 
IVDMDs can be marketed only if their manufacturers have previously appended 
the CE marking. This requirement does not apply to devices intended for clinical 

254 
����������������������������������������
RFID Technology for Medical Applications
investigation, to custom-made medical devices, or to in vitro diagnostic medical 
devices for evaluating performance [51]. 
The manufacturer must prove that his or her device conforms to the require-
ments of the directive in question, before appending the CE marking to the device. 
The CE marking symbolizes compliance of the device with the essential require-
ments of the directives.
The three stages of the clinical development of a new MD are the preclinical 
phase, the clinical phase, and a launch of a new product. The preclinical phase of 
the MD development consists of technological revisions, in vitro tests, and possible 
animal experiments. The clinical phase consists of feasibility studies (patient selec-
tion, surgical technique, clinical efficiency, complications, and risks) and studies 
demonstrating clinical benefits. MDs are divided into classes as a function of their 
level of risk, and the principal texts of the European regulations that apply to MDs 
are available on the European Commission Web site [52]. 
The FDA has also officially recognized device-specific and general standards 
published by standards bodies such as the Association for the Advancement of 
Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the International Electrotechnical Commis-
sion (IEC). The FDA general and specific guidance and standards recognized by the 
FDA are listed on the FDA’s Web site.
To support decision making, the Medical Technology Assessment (MTA)13 
evaluates medical technology based on medical efficiency and other aspects. The 
Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA) in the early stage aims to provide deci-
sion-makers involved in technological development and health care with a tool to 
help steer technological development [53]. 
Many of the decisions here are cost-related. Three groups of stakeholders are 
likely to lobby on behalf of new technologies even if their benefit is less than their 
cost: product manufacturers who want to make the new technology, physicians 
and hospitals that want to use it, and patients who want or need to receive it. All 
three are relatively small groups whose members have relatively high individual 
stakes in the issue; on the other side are the people who will ultimately pay for the 
very expensive technology, but are never included in the decision-making process: 
taxpayers and insured people [54]. 
Many emerging technologies, in addition to the technical challenges and cost-
related issues, present ethical challenges, and wireless body implants are not an 
exception. There are two aspects of ethical and moral issues important for discus-
sion about WBIs and their implementation. The first one is related to the problem 
of security and privacy invasion, and it is commonly discussed in society today. The 
second aspect is related to the human enhancement; in spite of the assumption of 
the safe environment without the possibility of breach of security and privacy of 
an individual, some people might ask, and rightly so, if society should go that far 
and really do that.
13.	 The technology assessment literature generally defines medical technology as including not only machinery, 
devices, and drugs, but also medical practices and procedures.

7.3.3  Laws and Regulations Regarding Wireless Body Implants
To answer consumers’ concerns about the privacy and use of their personal infor-
mation, many applicable consumer protections are already written into law. For 
example, retailers are already restricted in the sale or distribution of consumer in-
formation, and secure computer systems and data encryption schemes are already 
used for the electronic transfer of private data. There are already federal guidelines 
in place that address many of these concerns including the Privacy Act (1974), 
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (1986), the Telecommunications Act 
(1996), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996), and the 
Financial Modernization Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act–2000), among others. 
Most international ethics committees were created in the 1990s; UNESCO’s 
International Bioethics Committee (IBC) was created in 1993, and the Steering 
Committee on Bioethics of the Council of Europe dates from 1992. Most national 
and international ethics committees have been, in fact, until now committees on 
bioethics. 
The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) is a public interest research 
center in Washington, D.C., established in 1994 to focus public attention on emerg-
ing civil liberties issues and to protect privacy, freedom of expression and constitu-
tional values in the information age [55].
It seems at the first glance that body implants are not ethically problematic in 
the context of cardiac pacemakers. However, although particular information and 
communication technologies (ICT) may be used to repair deficient bodily capabili-
ties, others are ethically more problematic (especially neural implants), particularly 
if such devices are accessible via digital (and/or wireless) networks. Due to their 
network capability, ICT could be misused in several ways for all kinds of social 
surveillance or manipulation.
In December 1997 the European Commission set up the European Group on 
Ethics and New Technologies (EGE), which is the first international committee 
with a broader scope, succeeding the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implica-
tions of Biotechnology (GAEIB), which existed from 1991 to 1997. During its first 
mandate (1998–2000) the EGE provided opinions on subjects as diverse as human 
tissue banking, human embryo research, personal health data in the information 
society, doping in sports, and human stem cell research. The group also wrote the 
Report on the Charter on Fundamental Rights related to technological innovation. 
On April 24, 2001 the European Commission appointed 12 members for the 
period 2001 to 2004 and amended the EGE remit in order to strengthen the role 
of the group. The EGE is an independent, multidisciplinary and pluralist advisory 
group, composed of 12 members. Its role is to advise the European Commission on 
how ethical values should be taken into consideration in the regulation of scientific 
and technological developments.
On March 16, 2005, EGE adopted Opinion No. 20 on the ethical aspects of 
body implants in the humans and presented it to the European Commission [57]. 
The idea of placing electronic devices inside our bodies in order not just to repair 
but even to enhance human capabilities gives rise to science fiction visions with 
threat and/or benefit characteristics. Not surprisingly, the respect for human dig-
nity has been the fundamental basis of EGE discussions of where the limits should 
be drawn for different applications of body implants.

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
Body implants can be used for both medical and nonmedical purposes. Both 
types of implants clearly require informed consent. This information should not 
only concern possible benefits and health risks but also risks that such implants 
could be used to locate people and/or obtain access to information stored in these 
devices without the permission of the individuals in whom the devices are im-
planted. The use of body implants in order to obtain remote control over the will 
of people should be strictly prohibited.
Nevertheless, the ethical notion of the inviolability of the human body should 
not be understood as a barrier against the advancement of science and technology 
but as a barrier against its possible misuse. A broad social and political debate 
is needed to define what kind of applications should be accepted and legally ap-
proved, particularly concerning surveillance and enhancement.
The EGE insists that surveillance applications of body implants may only be 
permitted if there is an urgent and justified necessity and that there are no less in-
trusive methods. Currently, nonmedical body implants in the human body are not 
explicitly covered by existing legislation, particularly in terms of privacy and data 
protection.
In the EGE’s view, implantable devices for medical purposes should be regu-
lated in the same way as drugs when the medical goal is the same, particularly as 
such implants are only partly covered by Council Directive 90/385/EEC on the ap-
proximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medi-
cal devices. The EGE recommends that the European Commission should launch 
legislative initiatives in these areas of body implant applications [57].
The first infoethics goal, derived from the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights [UN General Assembly resolution 217 A (III) of December 10, 1948], es-
tablishes the fundamental priority of putting technology in the service of human 
rights. Derived from that goal are three others that aim to promote the public do-
main, diversity of content, and access to information and the means of communica-
tion, with these three based on the premise that all people should be able to share 
the benefits of body implants [59].
On July 17, 2007, the American Medical Association (AMA) officially estab-
lished a code of ethics designed to protect patients receiving RFID implants [60]; 
the code of ethics is not a law but a recommendation defining the essentials of hon-
orable physician behavior. The recommendations focus on safeguarding a patient’s 
privacy and health, and are the result of an evaluation by the AMA’s Council on 
Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) regarding the medical and ethical implications 
of RFID chips in humans.
The AMA’s report identified three specific recommendations: (1) the require-
ment for informed-consent process, (2) ensuring patients’ privacy by storing con-
fidential information only on secure RFID devices, and (3) requirement for phy-
sicians to support research into the safety of RFID devices implanted in human 
beings and examine the role of doctors regarding the nonmedical uses of the tech-
nology. The document unfortunately does not go into any details or specifics of the 
real-word implementation.
U.S. President George W. Bush created the President’s Council on Bioethics on 
the basis of the Executive Order 13237 from November 28, 2001. The role of the 
Council is to advise the President on ethical issues related to advances in biomedi-

cal science and technology. They had not published anything on the topic of ethics 
of implanted medical devices [58].
7.4  Wireless Neural Implants
Neuroscience starts with the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and contin-
ues on to incorporate the study of genetics, pharmacology, biochemistry, and other 
powerful influences on nervous system development and function. This relatively 
new field of science (started in about 1970) and includes research into neurological 
and psychiatric disorders and studies of aging, stress, sleep, memory, and move-
ment. Cognitive neuroscience is usually a more controversial branch of neurosci-
ence that focuses on the mind, learning, and human behavior. 
The human body reacts to a number of stimuli, both internally and externally. 
The mechanism to achieve the response is controlled via the nervous system. Im-
pulses travel from the tips of the fingers along nerves to the brain. The signals that 
travel along the nervous system result from electrical impulses and neurotransmit-
ters that communicate with another body tissue, for example, muscle. For conve-
nience, the nervous system is divided into two sections, which communicate with 
each other in order to achieve an overall steady state for the body: central and 
peripheral nervous systems. 
The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord and can be 
thought of as a central processing component of the overall nervous system. The 
peripheral nervous system consists of nerve cells and their fibers that emerge from 
the brain and spinal cord and communicate with the rest of the body. There are 
two types of nerve cells within the peripheral system: the afferent or sensory nerves, 
which carry nerve impulses from the sensory receptors in the body to the central 
nervous system, and the efferent or motor nerve cells, which convey information 
away from the central nervous system to the effectors (muscles and body organs.) 
The following brief nervous system description and pictures are adopted from 
[61–63]. 
7.4.1  The Brain and the Spinal Cord
The center of the nervous system is the brain. It has four major subdivisions: the 
brain stem, the cerebellum, the cerebrum, and the diencephalon. The location in the 
brain of these various divisions is depicted in Figure 7.7. Each is concerned with a 
specific function of the human body. 
The cerebrum (Latin for brain) is the largest part of the brain. It is composed 
largely of white matter with a thin outer layer of gray matter, the cerebral cortex 
(surface). It is within the cortex that the higher brain functions of memory, reason-
ing, and abstract thought occur. The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres by a 
deep groove, the longitudinal fissure. Each hemisphere is further divided into lobes 
with specialized functions.
The cerebellum is concerned with coordination for skeletal muscle movement. 
The cerebellum is under the cerebrum and dorsal to the pons and medulla. Like the 
cerebrum, it is divided into two hemispheres. It helps to control voluntary muscle 
movements and to maintain posture, coordination, and balance.

258

The brain stem sends messages between the spinal cord and the brain and 
helps control the heart rate, respiratory rate, swallowing, and blood pressure and 
is involved with hearing, taste, and other senses. The brainstem consists of the mid-
brain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. 
The midbrain contains reflex centers for improved vision and hearing. The 
pons forms a bulge on the anterior surface of the brain stem. It contains fibers that 
connect different regions of the brain. The medulla connects the brain with the 
spinal cord. All impulses passing to and from the brain travel through this region. 
The diencephalon connects the midbrain with the cerebral hemispheres. Within 
its area it has the control of all sensory information, except smell, and relays this 
information to the cerebrum. Other areas within the diencephalon control the au-
tonomic nervous system regulate body heat, water balance, sleep/wake patterns, 
food intake, and behavioral responses associated with emotions. 
The cerebrum and the diencephalon together constitute the forebrain. The 
frontal lobe is responsible for voluntary movement and planning and is thought to 
be the most significant lobe for personality and intelligence.
The human brain is mostly water (about 75% in the adult) and has a consis-
tency similar to that of set jelly. The brain is protected by the skull. Within the brain 
are four ventricles (cavities) in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced. This 
fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord, acting as a protective cushion for 
these tissues. Covering the brain and the spinal cord are three protective layers, 
together called the meninges. The outermost and toughest of the three is the dura 
mater. The middle layer is the arachnoid. The thin, vascular inner layer, attached 
directly to the tissue of the brain and spinal cord, is the pia mater.
Figure 7.7  The human brain.

7.4  Wireless Neural Implants

The capillaries within the brain have walls that are highly impermeable and 
therefore prevent toxic substances causing damage to the brain. Without this pro-
tection the delicate neurons could easily be damaged.
The brain is connected to the spinal cord via the brain stem. The spinal cord 
extends from the skull to the lumbar region of the human back. Twelve pairs of 
cranial nerves, identified by Roman numerals and also by name, connect with the 
brain. 
Presented in Figure 7.8 is the distribution of the nerves from the spinal cord. 
Similar to the brain, the spinal cord is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid. The cord 
and the cerebrospinal fluid are contained within a ringed sheath called the dura-
matter. All these structures are contained within the vertebral column.  
The vertebral column is made up of individual vertebrae that are separated 
from each other by annular intervertebral discs. These discs have a consistency sim-
ilar to rubber and act as shock absorbers for the vertebral column. Each vertebra 
has a canal from which the spinal nerve can leave the spinal column and become a 
peripheral nerve. 
Figure 7.9 illustrates the function of a peripheral nerve. It transmits sensory in-
formation to the spinal cord, from which information can either be transmitted to 
the higher nervous system, the brain, for interpretation and action, or can be acted 
on directly within the spinal cord and the information sent back down the ventral

route to initiate the response. If the spinal cord is injured, the resulting disability is 
related to the level of the injury. 
Injuries of the spinal cord near the brain result in larger loss of function com-
pared to injuries lower down the cord. Paraplegia is the loss of motor and sensory 
functions in the legs. This results if the cord is injured in the thoracic or upper 
lumbar region. Quadriplegia (or tetraplegia) involves paralysis of all four limbs and 
occurs from injury at the cervical region. Injuries above the C4 level may require 
a ventilator or electrical implant for the person to breathe. This is because the dia-
phragm is controlled by spinal nerves exiting at the upper level of the neck. 
Hemiplegia results in the paralysis of the upper and lower limbs on one side of 
the body, and occurs due to the rupture of an artery within the brain. 
Due to the architecture of the connections between the right- and left-hand 
sides of the brain, damage to the right-hand side of the brain would result in hemi-
plegia in the opposite side.
7.4.2  The Neurons and the Neurostimulation
The nervous system contains nerve cells, or neurons; they are specialized cells that 
enable the transmission of impulses from one part of the body to another via the 
central nervous system. Brains of the most advanced insects (honey bees) have 
about 1 million neurons, snails have about 20,000, and primitive worms (nema-
todes) have about 300, while 100 billion or so are required for human levels of 
intelligence. 
From the engineering prospective, the human brain can be looked at as a highly 
distributed, parallel, and hierarchal biological computer, and its neural cells as na-
ture’s own transistors [64]. Neurons have two properties: excitability, or the ability 
to respond to stimuli, and conductivity, the ability to conduct a signal. Neurons

transmit information via electrical pulses [65]; more information can also be found 
in [66].
Similar to all other body cells, transmission depends upon the difference in po-
tential across the membrane of the cell wall. The change in potential is mediated by 
transmembrane flow of ions. Electromagnetic fields of different frequencies could 
affect this system by induced current or direct field effect on molecular interactions. 
The therapeutic effect of electromagnetic fields has been studied on a variety of 
neurological diseases, and in these studies extremely low-frequency (ELF) magnetic 
or electric fields have been used. The application of electromagnetic energy for the 
treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases is still in its infancy.
Cognitive science is advancing the understanding of brain functions using im-
aging techniques, multi-electrode sensing, and neural prosthesis. Multichannel re-
cording of neural activity from the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral 
nervous system (PNS) has long been pursued by physiologists as a means of un-
derstanding the operation of individual neurons, of deciphering the organization 
and signal processing techniques of biological neural networks, and of controlling 
a variety of prosthetic devices. 
In September 2010, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded grants 
totaling $40 million to map the human brain’s connections in high resolution [67]: 
the Human Connectome Project14.
Brain implants, commonly referred to as neural implants, are devices that con-
nect directly to the brain, usually placed on the surface of the brain, or attached to 
the brain’s cortex. Different techniques have been used to produce recording probes 
for interfacing with the nervous system, using percutaneous (skin-penetrating) con-
nectors for power and data transfer. A common purpose of modern brain implants 
and the focus of intense research are to establish a biomedical prosthesis bypassing 
areas in the brain, which became dysfunctional after a stroke or other head injuries. 
Neural prostheses interface nerves for therapy and rehabilitation; spinal cord 
stimulators treat incontinence, cochlea implants restore hearing, vagal nerve stimu-
lators suppress epileptic seizures and depression, and so forth [68, 69].
Neurostimulation is a process by which nerves partially losing their function 
as a result of disease or trauma are stimulated using artificial electrical pulses for 
regeneration. Electrical signals used for this purpose must be consistent with the 
natural activity of human neurophysiology. Some brain implants involve creating 
interfaces between neural systems and computer chips, which are part of a wider 
research field called brain-computer interfaces. Brain-computer interface devices 
detect and translate neural activity into command sequences for computers and 
prostheses. 
Electrical devices called deep brain stimulators (DBS) are essentially a pace-
maker for the brain. Since the FDA approved such brain pacemakers and the elec-
trically based treatment they deliver for a disorder called an essential tremor in 
14.	 The Human Connectome Project should provide better understanding of brain connectivity and promises 
improved diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. This project will lead to advances in understanding 
what makes us uniquely human and will help future studies of abnormal brain circuits in many neurologi-
cal and psychiatric disorders.

1997, for Parkinson’s disease in 2002, and for a degenerative brain disease called 
dystonia15 in 2003, over 75,000 people have had them installed [70]. 
Implanted electrical stimulators were first used in 1967. They were primarily 
developed for the management of chronic pain. In the case of persistent and ex-
tensive pain, especially neurogenic pain that does not generally respond to drugs, 
transcutaneous16 electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is not adequate due to the 
need for multiple electrode placement and increased skin impedance. In order more 
effectively to cover the painful area, direct stimulation of the spinal cord is neces-
sary via an implantable electrode system. A discussion and a summary on neural 
implants and direct brain control of prosthetic systems are given in [71].
The brain stimulators are not the cure for the disease, but they can give patients 
a better quality of life; the beneficial effect has lasted for almost a decade so far in 
Parkinson’s patients, and it is expected the dystonia effect will also be long lasting 
[72]. 
In the last few years, scientists have developed a way to stimulate neurons using 
light rather than electricity. Researchers are developing a prototype neural implant 
that uses light to alter the behavior of neurons in the brain. The device is based on 
the emerging science of optogenetic neuromodulation, in which specific brain cells 
are genetically engineered to respond to light [73]. This effort is still some time 
away from the implementation on humans. 
Used for therapy in cases like these, implantable brain chips are not very con-
troversial and represent desirable procedures. The issues that arise with such thera-
peutic uses of implantable brain chips primarily involve questions of equity and the 
costs of implementing this technology. 
Although deep brain stimulation is increasingly becoming routine for patients 
with Parkinson’s disease, there may be some behavioral side effects (possibility 
of apathy, hallucinations, compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, cognitive dysfunc-
tion, and depression.) However, these may be temporary and related to the correct 
placement and calibration of the stimulator and so are potentially reversible.
A disorder such as obesity can be treated by applying an electrical signal to an 
autonomic nerve (e.g., a vagus nerve17). The signal has a duty cycle, including an on 
time (30 to 180 seconds) during which the signal is applied by to the nerve followed 
by an off time during which the signal is not applied to the nerve. When applying 
an electrical signal to a nerve, the signal is commonly a series of pulses applied over 
a period of time. For example, to treat obesity, a bipolar signal is applied to both 
the anterior and posterior vagus nerves via electrodes placed on the nerves and con-
nected to a pulse generator. 
As shown in U.S. patent application Publication No. US 2005/0038484 A1 
published February 17, 2005, the signal may be any signal in excess of a 200-Hz 
blocking signal reported in [74]. A 5-kHz signal is currently preferred in most 
cases. The current of the signal is selected to block the nerve without injury to the 
nerve; amplitudes may range from about 1–6 mA. These signals are applied with a 
15.	 Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and 
repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The disorder may be inherited or caused by other factors such 
as birth-related or other physical trauma, infection, poisoning (e.g., lead poisoning), or reaction to drugs.

duty cycle, for example, applying a signal for 5 minutes (referred to herein as an on 
time) followed by 10 minutes of no signal (referred to herein as an off time). The 
pattern is repeated during the day (for example, while the patient is awake) and 
repeated for an indefinite number of days (e.g., daily for 6 months, 12 months, or 
more).
7.4.3  Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
With the today’s evolution of neuroscience, engineering, and computing technology, 
the era of clinical neuroprosthetics is becoming a practical reality for people with 
severe motor impairment. 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),18 brain-stem stroke, and severe brain or 
spinal cord injury can damage the neural pathways that control muscles or damage 
the muscles themselves. Individuals most severely affected may lose all voluntary 
muscle control, including eye movements and respiration, and may be completely 
locked in to their bodies, unable to communicate in any way [75]. 
Brain-computer interfaces (BCI)19 are devices that capture brain signals in-
volved in a subject’s intention to act, with the potential to restore communica-
tion and movement to those who are immobilized, thus providing an alternative 
method of communication and control for the most severely affected individuals. 
Other commonly used terms include: motor neuroprosthetics, direct brain interface 
(DBI), brain-machine interface (BMI), and neurorobotics. Andrew B. Schwartz in 
[76] describes the beginnings of BCI in the late 1960s and early 1970s:
1.	 1970s: Research developed algorithms to reconstruct movements from mo-
tor cortex neurons, which control movement.
2.	 1980s: Johns Hopkins researchers found a mathematical relationship be-
tween electrical responses of single motor-cortex neurons in rhesus ma-
caque monkeys and the direction that monkeys moved their arms (based 
on a cosine function).
3.	 1990s: Several groups were able to capture complex brain motor center 
signals using recordings from neurons to control external devices.
4.	 2000s: Permanent implants became possible due to the advances in elec-
tronics (miniaturization) and development of new materials.
BCIs have been researched mainly as aids to patients with severe neuromus-
cular impairments but could also be used in other applications. Current devices 
record electrical activity from the scalp, on the surface of the brain, and within 
the cerebral cortex, and one of the goals of BCI research is to better understand 
18.	 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a form of motor neuron 
disease. ALS is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disease caused by the degeneration of motor neu-
rons, the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. The condition 
is often called Lou Gehrig’s disease in North America, after the famous New York Yankees baseball player 
who was diagnosed with the disease in 1939.
19.	 The main difference between BCI and DBS described earlier is that DBS delivers fixed stimulation to acti-
vate or inactivate certain pathways in specific brain regions, whereas in BCI the neural prostheses record 
specific neural activity and respond with appropriate feedback.

264

the neural coding of information. These signals are being translated to command 
signals driving prosthetic limbs and computer displays. 
A functional BCI system is a closed-loop, real-time system: 
	
	
The most important component in a BCI is a signal processing decoding algo-
rithm that converts the raw electrophysiological signal into an output that is suit-
able to control the external device. 
A prolonged learning phase may be required to train the subject to encode the 
desired action into observable changes in his measured neural activity. Therefore, 
a feedback mechanism and adaptation are important part of the process. As a new 
output channel, the user must have feedback to improve the performance of how 
they alter their electrophysiological signals. Continuous alteration of the neuronal 
output20 matched against feedback from the overt actions (same for learning to 
walk, complex movements, and so forth), so the subject’s output can thus be tuned 
to optimize their performance toward the intended goal. The better the subject and 
computer are able to adapt, the shorter will be the training required for control 
[77].
EEG arrays allow interface between mind and machine but do not require di-
rect implantation of a device. One of the very first successful attempts was on Oc-
tober 14, 2003, when the Associated Press announced that monkeys with brain im-
plants could consciously move a robot arm with their thoughts. This was achieved 
by researchers at Duke University, who were hoping to allow paralyzed people to 
perform similar tasks. 
Beyond offering a beneficial therapeutic technique for the patient with a dam-
aged brain, BCI could potentially lead to an augmentation in normal brain perfor-
mance, significantly extending the brain’s power to interact with machines. This 
prospect is both exciting and frightening, and it certainly demands serious ethical 
analysis [78].
In 2008, monkeys in the Schwartz Laboratory (named after Andrew Schwarz, 
a professor of neurobiology) were able to move a robotic arm to feed themselves 
marshmallows and chunks of fruit while their own arms were restrained. The 
probes (wide as a human hair) are inserted into neuronal pathways in the monkey’s 
motor cortex, a brain region where voluntary movement originates as electrical 
impulses. The neurons’ collective activity is then evaluated using software pro-
grammed with a mathematic algorithm and then sent to the arm, which carries out 
the actions the monkey intended to perform with its own limb. Movements are 
fluid and natural, and evidence shows that the monkeys come to regard the robotic 
device as part of their own bodies.
It is important to realize that the success of patient communication using BCI 
depends on the existence of an external and established telecommunications and/
20.	 Neuronal implants are artificial devices that are implanted into the human body and have contacts to 
nerves or neural tissues. These devices interact with the body by electrical stimulation. Neuronal implants 
are also termed neuroprosthetics.

or wireless infrastructure (i.e., without phone lines, computers, the Internet, e-mail, 
and simple electrical power), a neural implant would be useless. What makes a 
prosthetic, monitoring, enhancement application, and/or microchips and biosen-
sors useful is not simply their implantation into the human body, but the fact that 
they integrate the human body into an external information and telecommunica-
tions environment, sort of AmI. 
7.4.3.1  Electroencephalography (EEG)
EEG is the safest way of recording brain activity because the electrodes are placed 
on the scalp (noninvasive procedure). Unfortunately, the human scalp is 20–30 mm 
(about 1 inch) away from the surface of the cortex (Figure 7.10). The potential from 
an individual dipole falls off at one over the square of distance, a 300-µV action 
potential, recorded 0.1 mm away from a neuron, would be reduced to an amplitude 
of 25 pV when recorded 20 mm away.
Although spikes of individual neurons generate extracellular potentials with 
frequency components up to 5–10 kHz, the EEG signal on the surface of the brain 
does not contain significant frequency content above 70 Hz, skull serving as a 
lowpass filter for the underlying cortical activity. For instance, the large distance 
between the recording electrode and the underlying cortex allows capacitive effects 
of the tissue to shunt high frequency currents more locally. 
µ (8–12 Hz)21 and β (18–25 Hz) frequencies are the two dominant bands used 
in EEG BCI. High-amplitude α waves are associated with a restful, meditative 
21.	 Alpha (α) waves are electromagnetic oscillations in the range of 8–12 Hz arising from synchronous and 
coherent (in phase or constructive) electrical activity of thalamic pacemaker cells in humans. They are also 
called Berger’s wave in memory of the founder of EEG. An alpha-like variant called mu (µ) can be found 
over the motor cortex (central scalp) that is reduced with movement, or the intention to move.

mind, while low-amplitude β waves with multiple and varying frequencies are often 
associated with active, busy, or anxious thinking and active concentration.
7.4.3.2  Single-Unit BCI
From the engineering point of view, the optimal method of recording this electrical 
information would be to place a series of small electrodes directly into the dipole 
sheet to intercept signals from individual neurons (i.e., single-unit BCI designs). 
Single unit BCI system consists of a 10 × 10 array of microelectrodes; the array is 
attached by cable that transmits signals to a specialized head-mounted, titanium-
based connector (Figure 7.11). This high-density microelectrode array is designed 
to function as a direct cortical interface device and can be implanted in human 
cortical tissue22 without acute clinical complications [79].
The ability of a microelectrode to record single-unit action potentials depends 
on many factors, such as electrode impedance, tip size and shape, whether the tar-
get cell has an open or closed extracellular field, and the size and orientation of the 
target cell bodies in the cerebrum (>100 mm or about 4 inches) and generate large 
electrical fields, making them an ideal source for extracellular recording. The sig-

science in Europe involves noninvasive technologies (due to constraints and intimidations imposed by ani-
mal rights organizations).

nals from penetrating microelectrodes used in single-unit recordings are typically 
bandpass filtered between 300 and 5,000 Hz.
The connector enables cabled access to external electronics which combine 
low-noise preamplifiers for each channel with their signal multiplexing, perform 
analog-to-digital conversion, and execute spike analysis and other signal process-
ing tasks. Multichannel neural recording systems potentially produce large quanti-
ties of continuously streaming data that must be transmitted while the power dis-
sipation of implanted devices must be very low in order to prevent excessive tissue 
heating that can kill nearby cells [80].
Neurons rarely fire faster than 100 spikes per second (though rapid bursts of 
several spikes are possible), with firing rates around 10 Hz somewhat typical in ce-
rebral cortex. Signals from penetrating microelectrodes used in single-unit record-
ings are usually bandpass filtered between 300 and 5,000 Hz; however, the same 
electrodes can be used to record lower-frequency (<250 Hz), so called local field 
potentials (LFPs). This band has advantages because the lower-frequency compo-
nents seem to be much less affected by geometry and the tissue-electrode interface 
is so critical for single-unit recordings. 
The energy of the robust LFP signals in the primate premotor and motor cor-
tex23 has been shown to correlate with specific arm movement reach parameters 
such as direction, distance, and speed, and thus may be useful in neuroprosthetics 
(also called neuronal implants) applications. In some experiments using electrode 
arrays, scar tissue forms around microelectrode tips. This scar tissue tends to at-
tenuate spike signals from nearby neurons, but LFP signals seem to be less affected. 
In many applications, it is desirable to separate LFP and spike signals and analyze 
them separately.
Based on [81], since the potential from the neurons outside their membrane 
drops rapidly with distance, a rule of thumb is that any given exposed microelec-
trode tip should be located within about 30–50 µm from the neuron’s cell body 
within the background of conductive brain tissue to acquire a usefully measurable 
signal.
Microelectrode arrays composed of bundles of wires have been now largely 
replaced by monolithic arrays for work in primates (monkeys) and recently in first 
human trials. In research experiments, electrodes only needed to provide stable 
neural recordings for enough time to complete the experiment and/or prove the 
hypothesis. In [82] Ludwig discussed a need to design electrodes for a long-term 
implantation and realization of the clinically useful neuroprosthetics device. 
7.4.3.3  Electrocorticography (ECoG)
ECoG offers a different approach, using a plastic sheet filled with electrodes (Figure 
7.12). ECoG is a measure of the electrical activity of the brain taken from beneath 
the skull (subdural or epidural). The advantage of ECoG-based BCI systems is that 
recording electrodes are approximated on the cortical surface, yielding a much finer 
spatial resolution as well as the ability to record higher-frequency (10–200 Hz) 
content in the signal. 
23.	 The premotor cortex is an area of motor cortex lying within the frontal lobe of the brain.

268 
����������������������������������������
RFID Technology for Medical Applications
ECoG has a much better SNR and higher resolution than traditional EEG re-
corded with scalp electrodes, and it is less invasive compared to the single-neuron 
recording technique, where arrays of microelectrodes are inserted into the cortex. 
The sheet rests on the surface of the brain, recording signals from many neurons at 
once. The scar tissue does not form around the ECoG grid because it is implanted 
on the surface of the brain. 
Research had shown that the ECoG approach can reveal useful insights into 
what a patient wants to do by analyzing signals from groups of neurons, rather 
than single neurons. Examples include a desire to move a hand or to speak [83].
BCIs based on EEG have focused exclusively on µ and β frequencies because γ fre-
quencies are inconspicuous at the scalp. In contrast, γ frequencies as well as µ and 
β frequencies are prominent in ECoG during movements. The ECoG signal is much 
more robust compared to the EEG signal and it has five times the magnitude, finer 
resolution, and higher frequencies.
While ECoG systems are invasive, because they are on the brain surface, they 
result in stronger signals than penetrating electrodes, but they have not been stud-
ied extensively until recently, due to the limited access to subjects. According to 
Washington University in St. Louis, although the ECoG implants are currently left 
in place only temporarily, their researchers hope that one day they could be im-
planted for long-term usage [84]. 
ECoG electrodes suitable for chronic implants are just now being developed, 
and they are expected to be tested in nonhuman primates in the near future.

7.4.4  Wireless Neural Implants: Principle of Operation
Early working implants in humans now exist, designed to restore damaged hearing, 
sight, and movement. The commonality throughout the research is the cortical plas-
ticity (also referred to as neuroplasticity24) of the brain, which often adapts to BCIs. 
Currently, most brain implants contain implanted multi-electrode arrays using 
bundles of fine wires that tether the array to a skull-mounted connector; all elec-
tronics for amplification and recording is external to the body. The transcutaneous 
connector provides a path for infection, external noise and interfering signals easily 
couple to the wires conveying weak neural signals from high-impedance electrodes, 
and the connector and external electronics are typically large and bulky compared 
to the miniature electrode arrays. 
These issues present some major barriers to the development of practical neu-
roprosthetics devices. To eliminate these problems, signals from/to the implanted 
electrodes should be transmitted out of the body and to the extracutaneous receiver 
wirelessly, increasing safety and convenience for the patient. The wireless link has 
to fulfill multiple functions: power transmission and data transmission to and/or 
from the body. Passive telemetry (similar to load modulation in passive RFID sys-
tems) in most cases does not provide sufficient bandwidth, so the most commonly 
used are inductively coupled RF links or active systems using a transmitter and a 
receiver operating in MICS or some other frequency band.
One available therapy offering possible hope to a subset of chronic pain25 pa-
tients is Spinal-cord Stimulation (SCS), described in [85]. This therapy consists 
of electrical impulses triggering selected nerve fibers along the spinal cord. The 
stimulation of these nerve fibers inhibits pain messages from being transmitted to 
the brain.
A small ASIC can be programmed to deliver various stimulation patterns (ran-
dom stimuli, ramping stimuli, combined stimuli, and control of nerve fatigue) to 
the patient. Current pulses rather than voltage stimuli are delivered so as to be 
independent of the adjacent tissue impedance (i.e., load). The microprocessor can 
execute commands that it wirelessly receives from the external (host) computer and 
create and administer the desired therapy program. 
Power for the implant as well as data could be transmitted from the host 
through an inductive RF link. AM-modulated data is Manchester-coded so as to 
include also clock synchronization (reference) information for the implant and are 
serially transmitted. The internal circuitry is powered by the received RF signal 
picked up by an internal coil and rectified by the AC/DC-voltage converter while 
the AM demodulator is used for extracting the AM envelope.
24.	 Neuroplasticity is the capability of brain to act and react in many different and changing circumstances. 
Because of its plasticity, the brain can rebuild damage from trauma and disease. Healthy brain cells near 
an injured area of the brain can take on the functions of the damaged part of the brain. Sometimes a brain 
that has suffered trauma can figure out a new approach by reorganizing preexisting neuronal networks.
25.	 Usually, the purpose of a pain signal is to act as a warning that protects the body from potential harm. 
When the cause of the pain has been remedied and no additional injury or healing is occurring, at this 
point, pain no longer serves the purpose of warning, so it itself becomes the disease that needs treatment. 
Chronic pain can be very persistent and disabling and may not respond to drugs and other standard 
therapies.

7.4.5  Fully Implantable Wireless Neural Implants
Fully implantable, wireless neural implants still represent a serious biomedical engi-
neering challenge. Once implanted, wireless neural implants communicate with the 
outside world via the signals transmitted only transcutaneously [i.e., without any 
skin-penetrating (percutaneous) wires or feed-through connectors]. These implants 
are body-embedded and brain-interfaced microsystems where all neural sensor ar-
rays and all the active microelectronic circuits are sealed within the human body. 
A team of researchers at the Stanford University created a fully implantable 
neural recording system that was used on freely behaving animals [86]. The com-
munications frequency was around 4 GHz, with no interference issues from satel-
lites26. In addition, frequency was high enough to enable a design of small and 
efficient antennas while providing a high bandwidth with increased throughput.
Figure 7.13 depicts the design discussed in [87]; the outside unit provides power 
and clocking through inductively coupled RF unit while the data from the implant 
is optically transmitted through the skin. The data from the implant could also be 
transmitted via either an inductively coupled link or even an MICS band. 
Once the digitized neural signals from the brain of a health subject are extract-
ed, decoding algorithms and filters correlate the rates of spike activity recorded 
across the microelectrode array to the observed motion such as using a joystick or 
26.	 Geostationary communications satellites have a potential for causing interference into terrestrial radio sys-
tems since present INTELSAT satellites as well as a number of U.S. domestic satellites transmit a downlink 
frequency in the 4-GHz common carrier band.

7.5  Patient’s Risks

mouse to move a cursor on computer screen. This information will later be used in 
order for the brain signals to control desired motion of the paralyzed patients, for 
example. 
There are primarily two methods for retrieving data from an implant: passive 
impedance reflection and active transmission [88]. 
Passive transmission is also referred to as load modulation, where changes in 
the loading of the implanted secondary coil are reflected back as a change in the 
impedance of the primary coil (outside the body), as described in more detail in 
Chapter 1. External decoding circuitry can sense the loading changes to detect the 
transmitted data. 
In active transmission, the implant circuitry drives an implanted antenna to 
actively transmit the signals to the external receiver, where the carrier is modulated 
in amplitude, frequency, or phase. Active transmission consumes more power, but 
achieves higher data rates and greater range than passive transmission. 
7.5  Patient’s Risks
There are numbers of potential risks associated with the neural implants, some 
more obvious than others, so risk-benefits analysis is sometimes required to assess 
whether suggested procedure should be undertaken. 
This analysis is somewhat subjective since there are no universal performance 
criteria for the implanted neural or any other type of medical devices; different pa-
tients will have different levels of tolerance for the idea of undergoing an unproven 
and, in many cases, experimental procedure. In addition, in most cases, it may be 
difficult to quantify the risks of these proposed procedures.
7.5.1  Surgical Risks
Implanting foreign objects into various parts of the body all carry certain risks, and 
brain implants are no exception [89]. Chronic subdural hematoma, seizure, infec-
tions, subcortical hemorrhages, pulmonary embolisms, potential for a long-term 
damage to brain tissue, and even perioperative deaths27 are just a few examples 
of things that could go wrong. Another important consideration here is a need of 
neural implants for maintenance, replacement, and upgrades. 
Neurons can survive in an environment with a temperature of 30°–40°C; an in-
creased temperature for an extended period of time can be harmful and could even-
tually cause the death of brain tissue. Neural implants, in order to avoid excessive 
heating of the brain tissue, should produce a power density below 62 mW/cm2 [90].
Clinical research is different from the medical treatment, and physicians as 
well as patients must understand the difference. Clinical research, by definition, 
investigates a clinical intervention/procedure involving humans in order to obtain 
scientific knowledge that may or may not benefit the subject. The new field of neu-
roethics, in conjunction with institutional review boards, ensures that human trials 
are closely monitored for ethical and legal compliance. 
27.	 The perioperative period is the time period describing the duration of a patient’s surgical procedure; this 
commonly includes ward admission, anesthesia, surgery, and recovery.

272 
����������������������������������������
RFID Technology for Medical Applications
Today the use of unwilling research subjects is ethically (and legally) unaccept-
able. What is required is an informed consent, i.e., voluntary participation by a 
subject after a clear dialogue regarding the nature of the intervention, the risks and 
benefits, and any other alternatives. 
If the risks that could harm the patient are suspected, physicians must quite 
often balance beneficence and nonmaleficence28. Treatment of any kind should not 
cause any contraindications such as unwanted side effects and/or additional com-
plications. One of the common statements, which should be investigated further, 
is that implanted RF devices could cause a growth of a tumor and/or cancer in a 
human body. It should be emphasized that at the time of this writing, there were 
no reliable scientific studies and/or conclusions concerning the long-term health 
impact of implants in the human body.
7.5.2  Security and Privacy Risks
Forty years ago, in the preinformation society, local social norms such as simple 
norms of decency and strong physical (walls) and temporal (limitation of human 
memory) boundaries were sufficient in maintaining the free and democratic char-
acteristics of society. Today technology creates new privacy issues, for example, 
known and even accepted surveillance, collection of nonintimate information, and 
collection of information in public. As a result, society has to deepen its under-
standing of traditional concerns regarding privacy in order to respond to these new 
situations [91].
People value a sense of freedom and privacy29. While there are variations to its 
formal definition, privacy can be defined as freedom from the intrusion of others in 
one’s private (personal) life or affairs. Moreover, many view privacy as a right and 
a legal and absolute standard that is one of our inherent civil liberties; privacy as a 
legal right is actually a recent creation, starting in the mid-1960s [92]. 
Information privacy is the interest that individuals have in controlling, or at 
least significantly influencing, the handling of data about themselves. Communi-
cational privacy is the enjoyment of a certain level of intimacy when one com-
municates with others, even in the public space, as well as a guarantee of some 
confidentiality of the content of one’s communications with others. Privacy can be 
achieved at home, protected from undesired and unconsented intrusions by others, 
but home does not provide protection against ubiquitous and pervasive computing, 
which has the potential to interfere with people’s spatial privacy.
Legislations have been passed to protect the information privacy of individu-
als; one such act is the Privacy Act, Public Law 93-579 (1974), which requires the 
U.S. government to safeguard personal data processed by federal agency computer 
28.	 Nonmaleficence is a physicians’ duty to do no harm. This includes avoiding even the risk of harm so 
anyone knowingly or unknowingly subjecting a patient or colleague to unnecessary risk has violated the 
principle of nonmaleficence.
29.	 The right to privacy is explicit in the European human rights framework, but not in the United States; the 
right to privacy has no explicit written constitutional basis except in the context of government intrusions, 
through the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures of the Fourth Amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution.

7.5  Patient’s Risks

systems and provide ways for individuals to find out what information is being 
recorded on them and the means to correct inaccuracies. 
Today the concept of privacy has been fused with data protection, which in-
terprets privacy in terms of management of personal information. It seems that 
because of technical advancements it is difficult for important elements, security, 
and privacy to completely coexist in certain environments. 
Medical devices such as oximeters, defibrillators, pacemakers, patient moni-
tors, and even neural implants are commonly equipped with wireless capabilities; 
interoperability between different systems has been studied for some time now 
[93]. The safety of the patient from the technical perspective is defined with the 
security of the communication channel between the neural implant and the outside 
unit or another implant/prosthesis in or on the patient’s body. 
Controlling electromechanical systems (prosthetic limbs), deep brain stimula-
tion, and cognitive function augmentation/enhancement via neural signals are new 
and developing field of biomedical engineering. Neurosecurity is a relatively new 
term describing the protection of the confidentiality (learning private information), 
integrity (change the settings and modify software), and availability (disabling or 
causing the malfunction) of neural implants from malicious hackers, attackers, or 
adversaries [94]. 
Today’s wireless technology used for neural implants requires the transmitter 
and the receiver to be in a very close proximity, from distance of a few millimeters 
(1/8 inch) to a few meters (10 feet). In addition, the processing capabilities of the 
electronic circuitry are limited and so is the potential damage to the patient’s safety 
and privacy. Eventually, the wireless communication channel between the neural 
implant and the outside unit will allow for the adjustment of the prosthesis, deep 
brain stimulation, or enhancement of the cognitive functions. 
The Internet started as a great idea of connecting people around the world, and 
while engineers were involved in making things work better and faster, increasing 
the bandwidth (i.e., transmission capacity and adding new features), others were 
involved in trying to maliciously attack and penetrate the networks. These attacks 
could be sometimes triggered by the financial gains, while in some cases a pure 
savagery or inappropriate application of the one’s ingenuity may be the reason.
Similar situations will happen with wireless implants in the future. Although 
the concerns regarding the wireless neural implants today is probably not a top 
priority, over the next 10 to 20 years they could become critical. Malicious attacks 
could change the therapy, disable implants, and cause brain damage by flooding 
neurons with meaningless random signals, or record (and steal) sensitive and per-
sonal information of the patient. The dignity principle prohibits the transformation 
of the human body into an object manipulated and/or controlled remotely.
Aside from the malicious attacks, the users themselves may want to increase or 
modify the settings of their neural implants as well. The wireless neural implants 
will have to be designed not only to the highest standards of safety and effective-
ness, but also designed ethically and to be capable of operating in different and 
sometimes hostile environments.

7.5.3  Ethical Issues
The next logical step in this development of the implantable brain chip is direct 
neural interfacing. Today a considerable research is being devoted to neural (brain) 
implants or a direct brain-machine interface; there could be serious implications 
and complications of directly communicating with computers or connecting to the 
Internet, or even a direct brain-to-brain interaction [95].
The implantable chips could generate, among other possibilities, an increased 
range of senses, enabling, for example, seeing infrared light, ultraviolet light, and 
chemical spectra; enhancing memory; enabling invisible communication with oth-
ers when making decisions; and facilitating access to information where and when 
it is needed. These enhancements will produce major improvements in quality of 
life or in job performance, but a number of technical, ethical, and social concerns 
should be considered before proceeding with implantable chips. 
According to the Danish Board of Technology [96], the brain is the place where 
experiences are stored and memories are retrieved, the place where ideas arise and 
thoughts are born, where decisions are made, and pleasure, pain, grief, and joy are 
felt. Hence, any increase in our understanding of the brain is bound to trigger im-
portant moral, ethical, legal, and socioeconomic questions. This knowledge results 
in the new methods of treatment, but it also raises some big questions such as the 
definition of normal versus abnormal, healthy versus ill, and even issues as basic as 
the definition of human life. 
One of the most obvious and basic problems involving the safety and evalu-
ation of the costs and benefits of these implants requires a consideration of the 
surgical and long-term risks. In addition, the issue of whether there should be a 
higher standard for safety when technologies are used for enhancement rather than 
therapy needs public debate. Due to the enormous potential for societal impact, the 
informed consent of recipients may not be sufficient for allowing implementation. 
In addition to the functional assessment and medical usefulness, ethical evalu-
ation of implantable devices is required to assess, at the minimum, the following 
areas of concern: issues of safety and informed consent, issues of manufacturing 
and scientific responsibility, anxieties about the psychological impacts of enhancing 
human nature, worries about possible usage in children, and issues of privacy and 
autonomy. 
Ethics and ethical decision-making are a highly abstract and intangible area in 
human behavior; ethical decisions that are strongly supported by one or more of 
the ethical principles without any contradiction or challenge from others may be 
regarded as very strong and well founded. However, decision-makers will encoun-
ter circumstances in which it is impossible to reconcile all the applicable principles 
and choosing between principles may be required. 
A decision or course of action does not necessarily become unethical just be-
cause it is contentious or other decision-makers would have reached different con-
clusions in similar circumstances. A decision-maker’s obligation is to consider all 
the relevant circumstances with as much care as is reasonably possible and to be 
appropriately accountable for decisions made. As is the case in the evaluation of 
any future technology, the reliable prediction of all the effects is not possible; nev-
ertheless, the potential for harm must be considered through risk analysis. 

7.6  Review Questions and Problems 
275
Probably one of the most useful ethical principles in everyday life is the Golden 
Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The Golden Rule (also 
called the ethics of reciprocity) does not replace usual moral norms but extends 
them as a consistency principle and tests people’s moral coherence (i.e., the spirit 
of fairness). The Golden Rule is universal and can be found in Christianity, Confu-
cianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism. 
Regardless of where the new technologies will go, the most important factor 
from the patient’s perspective is an informed consent. Patients should not be sub-
jected to technological risk until they have clearly understood the risk and have 
granted their consent without being unduly constrained by economic (health insur-
ance issue) or other external pressures. The contention is that the concept of free 
and informed consent as applied in the field of medicine is applicable to technology 
in general and ought to be a part of what guides morally grounded public policy.
Whether it is an implant, medication, or another procedure in question, the 
patient should be a part of a decision-making process when it comes to deciding 
what will be the course of action. In order to make that decision, a patient has to 
be informed of all the immediate and future potential benefits and harm.
7.6  Review Questions and Problems
1.	 What would be some of the most important technical considerations for 
engineers designing medical implants of any type? How about wireless 
implants?
2.	 Systems for monitoring hip implants have been under development for 
some time now. One system has been researched for the detection of hip 
prosthesis loosening and using vibration analysis. Special signal processing 
hardware allows the measurement of small amplitudes in the presence of 
noisy sensor signals. Try to conceptually describe what would a system like 
that look like. 
3.	 User satisfaction usually includes usability (also called user testing) and 
usefulness. When designing any type of human-made object, the ease with 
which this object can be used is very important. Usability includes the test-
ing in real situations and the study of the principles behind an object’s per-
ceived efficiency or elegance and is often associated with the functionalities 
of the product. In this context, the learning curve (i.e., how fast user can 
get used to the device and master its operation) is also a part of usability. 
	
  Usefulness determines how useful the product is, so the product could 
have a high usability (great user satisfaction, simple to operate, easy to 
learn) but very low usefulness since it is a very simple device without too 
many advanced (and useful) features. 
	
  User satisfaction concerns how sometimes technical achievements in 
medicine are celebrated in the media (transplantation medicine, prosthet-
ics) while the problems that the individual patient is experiencing are not 
discussed. A very important question for patients is how the quality of their 
life will be affected by using these new applications.

276 
����������������������������������������

  Think of a medical device of your choice. Describe how you would test 
that medical device in practice. What constitutes usability? What consti-
tutes usefulness? Which one (usability or usefulness) would you test first? 
Why? Which one is more important? Please elaborate your answer. 
4.	 MICS and other wireless communication can be accomplished at the sub-
stantial distance and without the assistance of another person so that a 
certain level of independence could be achieved. However, there is always 
a potential danger that the wireless communication between the patient’s 
brain and the outside unit could be intercepted, manipulated, and/or al-
tered in some way, so many ethicists are concerned that the technology has 
the potential to be used in nonmedical ways to affect the human mind and 
behavior. Discuss the issue.
5.	 Access to medical records and health care information as well as treat-
ment modification can be a result of the malicious attack by a third party, 
but it can also be self-administered (i.e., the users themselves may want to 
increase or modify the settings of their neural implants or use medications 
outside of the boundaries prescribed by the medical staff). 
	
  Discuss the possibility of these self-administered treatment modifications 
and their long-term consequences on a person’s health and well-being. Dis-
cuss how these potentially dangerous treatment modifications are impacted 
by the security mechanisms built into the implanted device(s) and its com-
munications channel.
6.	 In some developed countries it is a common practice to give volunteers 
(usually terminally ill patients) experimental medications30, which cannot 
be tested on human subjects otherwise. This is for patients who have noth-
ing to lose and is their last chance to get better while providing valuable 
information to researchers in medicine. Of course, this is done with the full 
consent of the patient or patient’s family. Please discuss this practice.
7.	 Research and explain why the metals are generally less biocompatible than 
ceramics or polymers. What can be done to improve this disadvantage of 
metals as implant materials?
8.	 Some people, for one reason or another, refuse to accept a surgery (or even 
medications) as a solution for their medical problems. They usually turn 
to alternative medicine for help. In Western culture, alternative medicine 
is any healing practice that does not fall within the realm of conventional 
medicine or that which has not been shown consistently to be effective. 
	
  Alternative medicine may include herbal medicine, acupuncture, home-
opathy, chiropractic medicine, hypnosis, meditation, and prayer. Although 
alternative medicine most likely will not help the patient to walk again, it 
may alleviate some of the physical and maybe even some of the psychologi-
cal pain and depression. 
30.	 Experimental medication, also called investigational agent or investigational drug, is a substance that has 
been tested in a laboratory and has gotten approval from the FDA to be tested on people. An experimental 
drug may be approved by the FDA for use in one disease or condition but could be considered investiga-
tional in other diseases or conditions.

7.6  Review Questions and Problems 
277
	
  For example, the placebo effect31 can have clinically important effect in 
some cases and it is not to be neglected in many of the alternative medicine 
treatments. 
	
  Please discuss the importance of placebo effect in helping to improve pa-
tient’s health. Can alternative medicine replace or augment common medi-
cal practice? Do you have any personal experience? 
9.	 The next step from RFID systems is AmI, a new field described as a seamless 
environment of computing, advanced networking technology, and specific 
interfaces. AmI will have networking technology embedded in everyday 
objects such as furniture, clothes, vehicles, appliances, roads, and smart 
materials. This environment should be aware of the specific characteristics 
and the needs of users and be capable of responding intelligently to spoken 
or gestured indications of desire and possibly even result in systems that are 
capable of engaging in intelligent dialogue. AmI should also be unobtrusive 
and simple in implementation and usage [97].
	
  AmI is based on three key, fairly new, technologies: ubiquitous comput-
ing, ubiquitous communication, and intelligent user interfaces. By provid-
ing an intelligent environment, an innovative intelligent personal health 
services can be developed while improving the quality and cost control at 
the same time [98]. 
	
  The WSN and BAN are the necessary technology for the development of 
the concept of AmI where users (patients) are provided services depending 
on their context [99]. Intelligent interfaces can empower people with severe 
motion impairments that can result from nonprogressive disorders, such as 
cerebral palsy, or degenerative neurological diseases, such as ALS, multiple 
sclerosis (MS), or muscular dystrophy (MD) [100].
	
  Although the application of the AmI vision may lead to a dramatic low-
ering of costs (reduction of time to diagnosis and time to treatment, outpa-
tient diagnosis and treatment), the risk of dehumanization and deperson-
alization of the patient should be carefully considered. The problem may 
exist in a progressive dehumanization and identification of the patient with 
the collection of his vital parameters. In other words, the risk is that the 
patient will be progressively disembodied, reduced to the sum of his or her 
biological and physiological functions. 
	
  A second risk may arise from the possibility for the patient to monitor 
directly data detected and stored by wearable biometric devices. This ca-
pability may contribute to increase awareness of patient’s body, but it may 
also increase the likelihood of self-diagnosis, with potential serious impli-
cations for the patient’s health [101].
	
  Generally speaking, people are concerned about the social consequences 
of a world full of embedded wireless implants, tags and readers. WBANs 
31.	 The phenomenon of an inert substance resulting in a patient’s medical improvement is called the placebo 
effect. The word placebo, Latin for “I shall please,” dates back to a Latin translation of the Bible by St. Je-
rome. It was first used in a medicinal context in the eighteenth century. A substance containing no medica-
tion is prescribed or given to reinforce a patient’s expectation to get well; positive results are called placebo 
effects and negative effects are called nocebo effects.

RFID Technology for Medical Applications
are a part of AmI; monitoring and tracking implanted devices outside of 
the designed purpose are a critical issue, as they provide details about the 
actual person. Society may need laws to specify who can access personal 
data logs and for what purpose. In Europe, the Data Protection Act already 
limits access to computer records of this kind, and the United States should 
probably enact similar legislation.
	
  What are your thoughts on the application of AmI for medical purposes? 
Should people be concerned with unexpected and undesired side effects in 
the attempt to improve human lives using the latest technology? Should we 
even continue with the development of the AmI? Write a short essay and 
provide arguments that support your answer.
10.	Fabrication of a very, very small RFID device with communicating ability 
is already achievable, and it appears technically possible to fabricate RFID 
device at the biomolecular scale that interrogates its local chemical envi-
ronment (sensing) or/and controls the biological machinery inside a single 
living cell [102]. The remote monitoring at such a very small-scale level is 
assumed to provide the selectivity requirement, that is, the local control of 
biomolecular machinery without damaging cells or even affecting the bio-
logical events in the surrounding medium. Discuss the concept of remote 
monitoring and control (activation/deactivation) of human biological func-
tions wirelessly by using RFID technology inside a single living cell. 
11.	The assumption that practically anything, including ethical dilemmas, can 
be described and analyzed mathematically [103]. Discuss at least one ap-
proach to the objective mathematical decision-making process that could 
be used in cases wherer you have intangible data.

Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and 
Their Applications
8.1  Market Trends and Usage
Many new and promising RFID applications are in the works. For example, me-
dicinal products can be tagged and traced to combat drug counterfeiting, and log-
ging tagged items into and out of your refrigerator can help you track when certain 
products are out of stock or whether certain products have gone beyond their ex-
piration date. 
An RFID chip can provide useful information over the whole life cycle of its 
tagged product. That is why RFID chips can improve customer relations through 
better after-sales services. There is a large field of applications when it comes to 
medical services and services for people with other types of needs. Even the track-
ing of criminals on parole from prison is imaginable. 
One of the most popular new developments is a contact-less payment solution 
called SmartPay for small payments in the United States. It is also an efficient tech-
nique to reduce thefts from shops, in addition to the stock-keeping function men-
tioned above. Looking into the future, RFID and smart tags will allow the creation 
of an Internet of things, where objects and locations may be directly related to one 
another. These objects will also be capable of increasingly intelligent interaction.
Apart from its expected benefits, the more intensive and extensive use of RFID 
also raises major issues in the areas of privacy, security, technological reliability, 
and international compatibility. One key challenge for decision-makers is to create 
a common vision and a set of goals on how RFID can keep companies (and coun-
tries) more innovative and competitive in the world economy. 
At the same time, citizens must have the tools and freedom of choice they need 
to protect their privacy and security. At present, technological challenges like the 
lack of global frequency standards, low reading rates, interference with other radio 
sources, insufficient encryption capabilities, and the cost of implementation and 
end-user concerns prevent wide adoption of RFID technology. Thus, the main is-
sues to be addressed are consumer privacy, standards and interoperability, harmo-
nization of the frequency spectrum, intellectual property rights, and future research 
needs.

����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
What will be the social consequences of a world full of embedded RFID tags 
and readers? Will our privacy be affected as RFID technology makes it possible for 
our movements to be tracked and allows our personal information to be available 
in unprecedented detail? These and many other questions must be answered before 
RFID systems become commonplace. One of the major worries for privacy advo-
cates is that RFID tags identifying individual items purchased with credit or debit 
cards would link buyers to the specific items in the card’s or the store’s databases. 
Marketers could then use these data to keep track of exactly what particular people 
bought, down to the color, size, style, and price, a lot more information than UPC 
bar codes reveal. 
Another concern is that RFID equipment will produce automatic audit trails of 
commercial transactions. In a totally tagged world, it will be easier to detect when 
we lie about how we spent our time or what we did and where. This capability 
could have great consequences for the workplace, and the legal system might look 
to using logs kept by tag readers as courtroom evidence. We may need laws to 
specify who can access data logs and for what purpose. In Europe, the Data Pro-
tection Act 19981 already limits access to computer records of this kind, and the 
United States will probably enact similar legislation.
The problem does not lie with RFID technologies themselves; it is the way in 
which they are deployed that raise privacy concerns. Privacy and security must be 
built in from the outset (i.e., at the design stage); just as privacy concerns must be 
identified in a broad and systemic manner, so too must technological solutions be 
addressed systemically. A thorough privacy impact assessment is critical. Users of 
RFID technologies and information systems should address the privacy and secu-
rity issues early in the design stages, with a particular emphasis on data minimiza-
tion. This means that wherever possible, efforts should be made to minimize the 
chance to identify, observe, and link the RFID tags with personal information and 
other associated data. 
Use of RFID information systems should be open and transparent and offer 
individuals as much opportunity as possible to participate and make informed 
decisions.
8.1.1  Barriers to RFID Adoption
National and international regulatory authorities are trying to bring at least some 
regional interoperability and, in some cases, international interoperability, but 
progress is slow and competition for valuable bandwidth is strong. There are cur-
rently two principal barriers to global implementations for low powered tags: the 
regulations and the laws of physics.
The saying “high speed, high frequency; high capability, high cost” still applies. 
With these constraints, RFID systems can now generally be grouped into two types, 
although with some exceptions:
•• Low-cost, but capable passive tag systems;
1.	
The 1998 act replaced and consolidated earlier legislation such as the Data Protection Act 1984 and the 
Access to Personal Files Act 1987. Later, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regu-
lations 2003 altered the consent requirement for most electronic marketing.

8.1  Market Trends and Usage 
287
•• High-cost specialized tags for operation at high speed and long distances.
RFID supporters envision a world where RFID reader devices are everywhere: 
in stores, cars, clothes, factories, and even in our home refrigerators. However, 
RFID tags will not become ubiquitous in consumer products as long as the price 
of the tags is viewed as prohibitively expensive by many businesses. RFID tags 
currently cost from 20 cents to $1 each, which still makes them impractical for 
identifying millions of items that cost only a few dollars. 
Some experts predict that in quantities of 1 billion, RFID tags would approach 
10 cents each. The holy grail of 5-cent tags, which is the stated primary goal of the 
Auto-ID Center, would be attained in lots of 10 billion. More recent technologi-
cal developments may put a 1-cent tag within reach, which, in turn, would fuel 
demand for RFID comparable to that for bar codes. 
Makers of RFID chips and so-called inlays, which include the chip, antenna, 
and substrate, have been trying for years to reduce prices for RFID tags to 5 cents. 
The types of materials and assembly methods used to package tags impact the final 
cost directly (around 30%) and to some extent the communication performance. In 
the supply chain, the cost of tags is one of the main considerations for mass adop-
tion, with the 5-cent tag being the much-discussed target. 
Traditionally, chip die size has always been the key focus, and IC companies 
have managed to get die sizes (chip area) down to around 0.3 mm2 for UHF chips, 
resulting in a manufacturing cost of about 1 to 2 cents depending on the silicon 
process, leaving 3 cents for the rest of the cost. This is where the real challenge now 
seems to be. 
However, these less expensive tags may lack the capabilities of their more ex-
pensive counterparts. As a result, most manufacturers have been content to cut 
prices at a steady rate of about 5% to 10% per year since 2000 while improving the 
technology. As a result, users of the tags are employing them in applications no one 
dreamed of a decade ago, despite their inability to reach the elusive nickel price.
At McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, for example, operators at-
tach bag tags with dual dipole antennas to luggage to ensure that RFID readers in 
the handling system can communicate with all bags, regardless of their orientation 
on conveyor belts. The technology integrates two antennas 90° from one another; 
thus, the RFID tags can communicate with the airport’s RFID readers, no matter 
how baggage handlers toss the luggage onto conveyor belts. Such dual-antenna 
tags have not reached rock-bottom prices, but at roughly 20 cents each, they offer 
capabilities that nickel tags cannot match.
Similarly, retailers have begun using tags with specialized antennas to enable 
garments buried in stacks to successfully communicate with RFID readers. Again, 
cheaper tags are unlikely to achieve such feats. 
There seems to be a lot of attention given to the cost of tags. The benefits that 
can be derived from implementing RFID can far outweigh the cost of the tags. An 
investment in time and money is required; however, to be successful and get the 
best return on investment (ROI), it is important to understand the technology and 
how it can benefit the organization. In other words, by understanding the technol-
ogy, it is possible to optimize the design and reduce overall cost of implementation.

Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
8.1.2  Globalization
Widespread deployment of RFID relies on availability of either dedicated or li-
cense-exempt bands. Current interest is in the UHF frequencies, which offer a good 
balance between antenna size and path loss. However, the requirements for these 
bands vary widely around the world, frustrating attempts to deploy systems in an 
era of global trade. 
Frequency band is just one of the challenges; given often-conflicting global con-
straints, with the implied requirement to recognize tags wherever goods might flow, 
the challenge is to build in support for multiple data rates, modulation formats, 
and interference environments through a flexible and programmable air interface. 
From the technical prospective, in order to make RFID a truly global technology, 
some basic requirements have to be fulfilled:
•• Compatibility: Suitability of products, processes, or services for use together 
under specific conditions to fulfill relevant requirements without causing un-
acceptable interactions. Interchangeability, interoperability, and noninterfer-
ence are differing levels (or degrees) of compatibility.
•• Interchangeability: The condition that exists between devices or systems that 
exhibit equivalent functionality, interface features, and performance to allow 
one to be exchanged for another, without alteration, and achieve the same 
operational service.
•• Interoperability: The condition that exists between systems, from different 
vendors, to execute bidirectional data exchange functions, in a manner that 
allows them to operate effectively together. A guarantee of a certain level 
of compatibility has to be achieved between different implementations of 
the same standard. The desired level of compatibility is specific to a given 
standard and can be limited to basic services. Interconnection and interoper-
ability are the main objectives of standardization. 
•• Noninterference: The condition that exists when standard-compliant com-
ponents of various types or of different vendor origins coexist within the 
same space without serious detrimental effect on one another’s performance. 
Components are not necessarily required to communicate with one another 
as part of a common infrastructure, but merely to peacefully coexist.
8.2  RFID Security and Privacy Aspects
8.2.1  Access to Information
If you are lost in an airport or parking lot, an RFID-based system that can guide 
you to your gate or car would be appealing. So too would be the ability to return 
items to shops without receipts, either for refunds or warranty servicing, and RFID-
enhanced medicine cabinets that ensure that you have remembered to take your 
medications. The concern is the effect on individual privacy of RFID-enabled com-
puting systems that can automatically see everyday objects: the clothing on your 

8.2  RFID Security and Privacy Aspects 
289
person, the medical implants in your body, the prescription drugs you are carrying, 
the payment devices in your pocket, and perhaps even individual pieces of paper, 
such as banknotes and airline tickets [1] (see Figure 8.1).
To increase consumer acceptance of RFID technology, RFID advocates must 
promote and implement comprehensive security measures, along with consumer 
education, enforcement guidelines, and research and development of practical se-
curity technologies. Technical organizations, such as EPCglobal, Inc., are develop-
ing standards for the electronic product code, including its Guidelines on EPC for 
Consumer Products. 
It is useful to understand the difference between on-tag and off-tag access con-
trol. As the name implies, on-tag access control mechanisms are located on the 
RFID tags themselves. On-tag access control is the most common type of RFID 
access control, with mechanisms including tag deactivation, cryptography, and tag-
reader authentication. 
In contrast, off-tag access control mechanisms put the access control mecha-
nism on a device external to the RFID tag. Examples of this include the RSA block-
er tag2, a special RFID tag designed to prevent readers from performing unwanted 
scanning and tracking of people or goods, without any disruption to normal RFID 
operation, and external reencryption. Off-tag access control has the advantage that 
it can protect low-cost RFID tags (such as EPC tags), because the access control 
does not require any extra complexity (hence, extra cost) on the RFID tag itself.

8.2.2  Privacy Threats and Protection
The impending ubiquity of RFID tags requires not only support mechanisms to 
provide adequate performance, but also measures to address privacy concerns asso-
ciated with unobtrusive tags on everyday items. When people envisioned computing 
capabilities everywhere, embedded in the environment in such a way that they can 
be used without being noticed, they also acknowledged that the invisible nature of 
the computing devices will make it difficult to know what is controlling what, what 
is connected to what, and where information is flowing. 
This tension between the contradicting requirements of control and privacy on 
the one hand and usability and performance on the other are well illustrated by the 
privacy concerns associated with the planned deployment of RFID technology in 
supermarkets and retail outlets. Two notable privacy issues complicate the adop-
tion of RFID systems:
1.	 Leaking information pertaining to personal property: If a generic dumb 
RFID system is used, anyone can read, without restriction, the connec-
tion between the product and the tag and obtain information regarding the 
tagged contents of, say, a purse or any tagged item worn on the body in a 
manner about which the possessor is unaware.
2.	 Tracking the consumer’s spending history and patterns and physical where-
abouts: If a product ID is specific to an individual (when, say, tags are used 
in clothes and other personal belongings such as shoes, watches, handbags, 
and jewelry), tracking the person’s movements over an extended period 
becomes an option. Not only can physical location be tracked, but an indi-
vidual’s personal information (stored on multiple independently managed 
databases) might also be accessible based on a unique ID.
These RFID privacy threats follow from the basic functionality of RFID tech-
nology that states that an ID can be read without permission, is constant and 
unique, and contains potentially sensitive data. A number of proposed RFID pri-
vacy protection schemes are classified based on the new functionality that they 
implement in RFID technology; they range from adding only memory to adding 
lightweight circuits. Each involves a trade-off between the cost of the tag and the 
value of privacy protection. Several approaches are briefly discussed next.
8.2.2.1  Kill Function
The EPCglobal standard specifies that tags must be equipped with at least one nulli-
fication function as a way to address public opposition. This function, called the kill 
command, disables the functionality of the tag after consumers purchase a product. 
It involves a high degree of consumer privacy protection at negligible cost; however, 
since the disabling process is performed manually by millions of individual consum-
ers, human error is always a possibility. Moreover, the major problem in killing the 
tag is that the various RFID stakeholders would no longer be able to take advantage 
of the future emerging services that would rely on the millions of RFID tags likely 
to be dispersed throughout the consumer environment.
This simple countermeasure, a built-in option designed to kill the functionality 
of an RFID tag when the consumer leaves the store, has been incorporated into the 

8.2  RFID Security and Privacy Aspects 
291
EPCglobal standard (Class 1 Generation 2 UHF Air Interface Protocol). For con-
sumers, its purpose is easy to understand and thus easy to accept. However, killing 
a tag’s functionality curtails the future potential use of RFID in consumer services, 
such as in smart refrigerators that automatically reorder food products, expiration 
date and product recall alarms, and personal library management. 
8.2.2.2  Normal Tags and Smart Tags 
Other privacy protection schemes generally reflect two main approaches: normal 
tags and smart tags. 
The normal tag approach protects individual consumer privacy without having 
to modify the existing tag or cost the user organization more money. The normal 
tag approach achieves privacy protection by preventing the unauthorized reading 
of the output from the tag, blocking electric waves with aluminum foil, or jamming 
waves to interfere with a tag’s ID being read by an adversary’s unauthenticated 
reader. 
Smart tags are equipped with additional components, such as rewritable mem-
ory, basic logic circuits, hash function units (turning data into a relatively small 
number that may serve as a digital fingerprint of the data), and common-key/pub-
lic-key encryption units. When the tag incorporates rewritable memory, the reader 
rewrites the information in the tag to achieve privacy protection. This approach is 
notable for its low cost, because the tag requires only rewritable memory.
On the other hand, a lightweight circuit is incorporated into the tag, and a re-
encrypted ID to the reader is calculated by the circuit. Although public key crypto-
systems come close to providing good privacy protection, they are not suitable for 
tags because public key primitives are complex and costly. A noteworthy scheme 
employing this technology is the hash-chain scheme, in which a hash function cir-
cuit is embedded in the tag, and the tag response is calculated by the hash function. 
The scheme holds down the cost of the tag, because the hash function is light-
weight, pseudorandom, and one way. 
Here, pseudorandom means the output of the hash function is computationally 
indistinguishable from a true random value. Being one way means it is computa-
tionally infeasible to compute the input of the hash function from output of the 
hash function. The scheme addresses ID leakage and tracing problems through 
the pseudorandomness of the hash function, which prevents leakage and tracing. 
Moreover, the scheme is forward secure; that is, even after the tag’s secret is ex-
posed through tampering, the tag’s past history cannot be traced due to the hash 
function being only one way. 
The drawback to the hash-chain scheme is that the load on the server is pro-
portional to the number of tags, though the load can be reduced through advanced 
computation.
8.2.3  The Blocker Tag
The RFID blocker tag takes a different approach to enhancing RFID privacy. It 
involves no modification to consumer tags. Rather, the blocker tag creates an RF 
environment that is hostile to RFID readers. The blocker tag is a specially config-
ured, ancillary RFID tag that prevents unauthorized scanning of consumer items. 

292 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
In a nutshell, the blocker tag spams misbehaving readers so they cannot locate the 
protected tags’ identifiers. At the same time, it permits authorized scanners to pro-
ceed normally [2].
The blocker tag spoofs the tree-walking protocol into thinking that all tags, 
that is, all identifiers, are present. To do this, it simply emits both a 0 and a 1 in 
response to all reader queries. The result is that the reader attempts to traverse the 
entire identifier tree, believing that all possible tag identifiers in the world are pres-
ent. The reader stalls because the tree is far too big to be fully scanned (for Class 1 
EPC tags, the tree would have 296 nodes). 
8.2.4  Reader Signal Energy Analysis
One approach to RFID privacy does not rely on logical protocols at all. A system 
has been proposed, based on the premise that legitimate readers are likely to be quite 
close to tags (such as at a checkout counter), whereas malicious readers are likely 
to be far away (such as a competitor in the parking lot). In other words, the farther 
away a reader is, the greater the noise level in the signal that a tag receives. With 
some additional circuitry, therefore, an RFID tag might be able to obtain a rough 
estimate of the querying reader’s distance and change its behavior accordingly. 
A tag interacting with a distant reader might only reveal the type of product 
to which it is attached, a pair of trousers, for example. When interacting with a 
nearby reader, however, the tag might also reveal its unique identifier. A more so-
phisticated, multitiered approach is also possible, in which tags furnish increasing 
amounts of information as readers get closer.
Of course, distance alone does not provide an ideal trust metric. However, 
distance could be combined with traditional access control techniques, such as a 
challenge-response protocol between the reader and tag, to achieve a more compre-
hensive approach to RFID tag privacy. Indeed, the distance-measurement approach 
is complementary to blocker tags.
8.2.5  Protecting the Public
The Federal Trade Commission held a hearing in June 2004 to “facilitate discus-
sion of the public policy issues surrounding the use of RFID and to encourage the 
development of best practices for RFID that do not compromise consumers’ privacy 
and security.” Their March 2005 released report [3] found that the privacy issues 
associated with RFID are linked to database security and that industry can play an 
important role in addressing privacy concerns raised by some RFID applications. 
The report emphasized the importance of industry self-regulatory programs, mean-
ingful accountability provisions to help ensure compliance, and implementation of 
reasonable and appropriate measures to protect data collected by RFID systems. 
Legislators in several states, recognizing privacy concerns stemming from the 
use of RFID, have introduced bills that seek to respond to the increasingly rapid 
adoption of RFID technology. While none of the proposed pieces of legislation 
has been passed into law, the introduction of these bills signifies that RFID-related 
technologies appears to be generating concerns within the legislative branches of 
state and federal governments.

8.2  RFID Security and Privacy Aspects 
293
According to some, legislation restricting RFID use at this early stage would 
likely stifle the technology and delay deployment in the marketplace3. It would be 
more productive to monitor the technology over the next few years, while engaging 
with the business and government sectors regarding their respective use of RFID 
and their policies on maintaining RFID privacy and security. 
A number of governments around the world, trying to ensure the protection of 
individual privacy rights, have raised concerns that the collection, storage, transfer, 
and use of personal information through RFID technology could possibly violate 
individuals’ privacy rights. For example, in the European Union, the EU Article 
29 Working Party of Member State Data Protection Authority has recently ex-
pressed its concern that RFID technology may contravene the requirements of the 
EU Directive on Data Protection. Accordingly, the European Commission has held 
a number of workshops and issued inquiries concerning the privacy implications 
of RFID. 
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is considering the rela-
tionship of RFID privacy to its recent privacy guidelines. In particular, South Korea 
has called for the development of RFID privacy guidelines in the forum’s Electronic 
Commerce Steering Group. In 2004, Japan also issued privacy guidelines for RFID. 
Finally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) 
Working Party on Information Security and Privacy is currently reviewing the scope 
of policies and concerns with the global use of RFID on security.
The U.S. State Department is implementing its conversion program for the 
RFID-based electronic passports, or e-passports, despite warnings from security 
experts that these passports could be accessed or tracked by the wrong individu-
als. In fact, some security experts feel that the technology contained in this type of 
passport could be used by terrorists to construct a bomb designed to target anyone 
of their choosing. 
There is also some concern that e-passports do not have enough security em-
bedded to resist hackers and the advancement of technology. Nevertheless, in Au-
gust 2006, the State Department began issuing e-passports4 containing RFID chips, 
and at the time of this writing, the plan was that all U.S. passports were expected 
to include RFID chips containing personal biometric information by 2017. 
8.2.6  Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices (FIP), published by the OECD in 1980, are a well-
established set of guidelines for consumer privacy (www.oecd.org). They have their 
roots in a 1973 report by the U.S. Department for Health, Education, and Welfare 
(HEW) and were drawn up by the OECD to better facilitate the cross-border trans-
fer of customer information as part of trade between its member states. The eight 
principles can be summarized as follows:
3.	
The Competitive Enterprise Institute (a nonprofit public policy organization advocating nonregulatory, 
market-based solutions) states that as RFID technology comes into full use, various social forces would 
constrain it more suitably than government regulation.
4.	
New U.S. e-passports contain a 64-kbit RFID chip with personal information about the passport holder. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials claim that the passports must be held within 10 
centimeters (4 inches) of a reader to have their data read.

1.	 Collection limitation: Data collectors should only collect information that 
is necessary, and should do so by lawful and fair means, that is, with the 
knowledge or consent of the data subject.
2.	 Data quality: The collected data should be kept up to date and stored only 
as long as it is relevant.
3.	 Purpose specification: The purpose for which data is collected should be 
specified (and announced) ahead of the data collection.
4.	 Use limitation: Personal data should only be used for the stated purpose, 
except with the data subject’s consent or as required by law.
5.	 Security safeguards: Reasonable security safeguards should protect collect-
ed data from unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure.
6.	 Openness: It should be possible for data subjects to learn about the data 
collector’s identity and how to get in touch with him or her.
7.	 Individual participation: Data subjects should be able to query data collec-
tors as to whether or not their personal information has been stored and, if 
possible, challenge (i.e., erase, rectify, or amend) this data.
8.	 Accountability: Data collectors should be accountable for complying with 
these principles.
The FIP forms the basis for many of today’s privacy laws, such as the EU Direc-
tive 95/46/EC (April 1995), which provides the framework for the national privacy 
laws of all EU-member states. For example, Article 6 of the Directive requires data 
collectors to collect only as much information as necessary (also called the propor-
tionality principle or the principle of data minimization), while Article 7 requires 
them to obtain the unambiguous consent of the data subject before collection. 
It is undisputed that the act of reading out one or more RFID tags can consti-
tute a data collection, meaning that existing privacy laws also apply to the com-
munication between tags and their readers. This has also been recently pointed out 
by the International Community of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners; at 
the outset, this would mean that RFID readers would need to be openly announced 
with the help of public signs and placards explaining the purpose and extent of the 
data collection, as well as the identity of the data collector. 
More comprehensive unofficial text of the EU Directive 95/46/EC can be found 
at the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Web site5.
8.3  Health Risks from RFID
Electricity and electromagnetic fields (EMFs) bring countless benefits to society. We 
cannot live without them, yet we do not know the consequences of long-term expo-
sure to EMFs, if indeed there are any. Therefore, research is needed to understand 
the risks and set appropriate safety standards. 
Scientists researching the health effects of nonionizing electromagnetic fields 
have to contend with an enormous electromagnetic spectrum, reaching from static 
electric and magnetic fields to EMFs at frequencies in the terahertz range. They

also have to contend with the complexity of the human organism. The number 
and nature of the ways in which these two systems interact can at present only be 
guessed at. 
Behind the scenes, there are the dynamic social and political forces at work 
among an enormous array of stakeholders with different interests in the field: the 
scientists and research groups themselves and policy makers, politicians, govern-
ments, and regulatory bodies, at local, national and international levels. We must 
not forget health professionals, industrialists, investors, trade associations, trade 
unions, marketing professionals, users of devices reliant on EMFs, patients, and so 
on; we should not overlook for a moment the modern media as well.
Today there are hundreds of thousands of RFID scanners and EAS systems in 
use. All of these systems utilize EMFs to detect and scan tags. According to some 
sources, RFID systems pose no threat to the health of ordinary people; this might 
be true but prolonged occupational exposure may occur. The report by The Inter-
national Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) examines 
the effects of EM radiation on humans [4]. The report describes mechanisms of 
thermal and nonthermal interaction between EM fields and biological systems. 
Thermal interaction is the heating of tissue which can cause damage. The most 
notable nonthermal interaction is brain stimulation, which means that the mem-
brane potentials may be altered at a cellular level and might have effects on the 
nervous system. The report states that the high frequencies of EAS/RFID system 
produce no heating or thermoregulatory stress. 
However, EAS and RFID devices may interact with medical devices such as 
pacemakers, which can cause dangerous situations and indirect health hazard. The 
report recommends that further studies should be made on this area and that de-
vice manufacturers should provide information needed for health risk assessments. 
There is also a need to continue to collect exposure data, especially for occupa-
tional groups. If possible, low-frequency and high-frequency exposure should be 
differentiated.
It is a well-known fact that strong electromagnetic fields can interfere with elec-
tronics. Hospitals contain many devices that are critical, for example, life-support 
equipment that must not be disrupted. Today many hospitals have banned the use 
of cellular phones because of the risks of interference. How are RFID applications 
compared to this? Are they a potential source of interference also?
Since 1993 there has existed an electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) stan-
dard for medical devices (MD), the IEC 60601-1-2. This standard, however, was 
originally only specified for frequencies lower than 1 GHz, and in 2001 it was 
updated to cover frequencies up to 2.5 GHz. In the standard it was specified that 
life-supporting equipment must be able to operate in presence of field strengths up 
to 10 V/m and nonlife-supporting up to 3 V/m [5].
RFID transmitters and similar short-range radio devices are regulated differ-
ently in Europe and in the United States. In Europe regulations are country-specific 
but based on the CEPT regulations. In the United States, radio devices have to 
conform to the FCC. 
Some general types of recommendations are listed here:

296 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
•• Continue to monitor current research on the health effects of exposure to 
radio frequencies from RFID equipment to verify whether new information 
indicates health risks. 
•• Ensure that any RFID equipment purchased meets the FCC requirements 
protecting users from any possible thermal effects and includes all possible 
measures to minimize the risks of emissions from the system interfering with 
electrically powered active medical devices, such as pacemakers.
•• Purchase of RFID equipment that meets the human exposure specifications 
of nonregulatory agencies such as the ANSI, the IEEE, the NCRP, American 
Conference of Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the ICNIRP.
•• If RFID equipment is installed, conduct measurements of the RF emissions 
levels generated from systems to insure that the emissions are below those 
recommended under the OSHA nonionizing standard (CFR 29, Section 
1910.97) and by the nonregulatory agencies listed in the previous point.
•• If RFID equipment is purchased, ensure that it is installed and maintained 
according to the manufacturers’ specifications.
8.4  Ethical and Moral Dilemmas of Technology
Regardless of whether the discussion is about a prosthetic, monitoring, or enhance-
ment application, what makes microchips and biosensors useful is not simply their 
implantation into the human body but their integration into an external informa-
tion and telecommunications environment. In doing so, people can gain greater 
control over their environments and transform how they interact with each other. 
The old question of how and if the law (and government) should intervene to 
guarantee that technological progress does not result in violations of fundamental 
rights and fundamental freedoms has been with us for a long time. The answer is 
undoubtedly tied to the present political, technological, and cultural assumptions, 
and many issues and dilemmas, beyond just the technical and operational capabili-
ties of any wireless or any other technology must be considered. 
Apart from the large number of technical considerations that must be under-
taken, there are a few intangible and theoretical considerations such as security, 
privacy, social, and ethical considerations that have to be discussed as well. Some of 
them may or may not be acceptable by the today’s standards and in today’s society, 
while others could lead to disastrous situations in the future and therefore of inter-
est to the research. A new term technoethics was coined to describe an interdisci-
plinary study of moral and ethical aspects of technology in society [6].
An ethical dilemma is usually defined as “a situation that often involves an 
apparent conflict between moral imperatives, in which to obey one would result 
in transgressing another” [7]. This definition recognizes that real ethical dilemmas 
involve choices among alternatives that have ethical or moral content. This is a 
multifaceted problem, and finding universally accepted solution will not come eas-
ily but the decisions that society makes today will impact future generations and 
their lifestyle. 

8.4  Ethical and Moral Dilemmas of Technology 
297
It is also critical to realize that technology has no moral value; it is neither good 
nor evil. Rather, it is the application of the technologies that raises the moral and 
ethical issues [8].
8.4.1  Basic Concepts of Ethics
Ethics could be defined as a discipline that deals with what is good and bad, as well 
as with the moral duty and obligation; it can also be regarded as a set of moral prin-
ciples or values. Morality is a doctrine or system of moral conduct. Moral conduct 
refers to principles of right and wrong in behavior. It is interesting that the words 
morale (Latin origin) and ethics (Greek origin) are in fact synonyms [9]. They are 
used interchangeably to refer to the study of right and wrong behavior.
Concepts of right and wrong are not simple; today they increasingly include the 
more difficult and subtle questions of fairness, justice, and equity. Two key branch-
es of moral philosophy, or ethics, are descriptive ethics and normative ethics, each 
taking a different perspective. Descriptive ethics is describing, characterizing, and 
studying the morality of a people, a culture, or a society and compares and con-
trasts different moral codes, practices, systems, beliefs, and values [10]. Descriptive 
ethics focuses on the prevailing set of ethical standards in the certain community.
By contrast, normative ethics is concerned with supplying and justifying a co-
herent moral system and seeks to uncover, develop, and justify basic moral prin-
ciples that are intended to guide behavior, actions, and decisions. Normative ethics, 
therefore, seeks to propose some principle or principles for distinguishing right 
from wrong. Normative ethics is concerned with establishing norms or standards 
by which certain practices might be guided or judged.
It is tempting to observe the prevalence of a particular practice and conclude 
that because so many are doing it (descriptive ethics), it must be acceptable behav-
ior. Normative ethics demands a more meaningful moral foundation and it would 
insist that a practice be justified on the basis of some ethical principle, argument, 
or rationale before being considered acceptable.  
Figure 8.2 shows some of the possible influences on a person’s conscience and 
its ethical behavior. Essentially, this diagram demonstrates that the ethical beliefs 
one holds and how these beliefs are applied are strongly influenced by personality 
and background. This view assumes that morality depends on a dual consideration 
of human nature and the human condition [i.e., specific social and cultural circum-
stances (cultural relativism) defining moral beliefs and practices] [11]. 
Some of the most important factors that influence ethical behavior are per-
sonal behavioral lessons learned as a child; over time, people consolidate these 
lessons into individual morals, self-imposed standards, and values. These morals, 
standards, and values also help determine how individuals perceive themselves and 
how they interact with other members of people in society.
In addition, organizational factors often affected by external forces influence 
a person’s ethical belief system. When people in everyday life are faced with events 
and situations that go against their ethical foundations, internal conflict can result, 
and people are not always functioning in a realm of purely right and wrong. 
Society may be defined as a community, a nation, or a broad grouping of peo-
ple having common traditions, values, institutions, and collective activities and 
interests. The environment is a key concept in understanding our relationships.

Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
The macroenvironment is, in a sense, just another way of thinking about society. 
Some philosophers see the macroenvironment as being composed of four segments: 
social, economic, political, and technological. The social segment (or environment) 
focuses on demographics, lifestyles, and social values of the society. The economic 
segment focuses on the nature and direction of the economy in which society oper-
ates. Variables of interest might include the gross national product, inflation, inter-
est rates, unemployment rates, foreign-exchange fluctuations, and various other 
aspects of economic activity. 
Ethical analysis and decision making occurs at various levels, ranging from the 
individual to the societal, and even the international. Sociotechnical problems are 
not solved in the strict sense that purely technical problems are, and quite often a 
conflict may emerge among choices made at these various levels. Today people re-
alize that advancing the species with information and science technology has great 
benefits, but at the same time these advancements contradict many individuals’ 
ethical beliefs or feelings. 
The political segment focuses on the processes by which laws get passed and 
officials get elected and all other aspects of the interaction between companies, po-
litical processes, and government. Of particular interest are the regulatory process 
and the changes that occur over time in business regulation, various industries, 
and various issues. Finally, the technological segment represents the total set of 
technology-based advancements or progress taking place in society [12].
Assumption that what is ethical in one country must be ethical in another 
country may not be necessarily true. Culture, customs, education, language, at-
titudes, and institutions vary from country to country, and these differences pose 
sometimes insurmountable obstacles. Ethical issues are difficult when dealing with 
one culture and once two or possibly more cultures are under consideration, it gets

extremely complicated. It is necessary to deal not only with differing customs, pro-
tocol, and ways of operating but also with differing concepts of law or notions of 
what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior in an ethical sense. 
The main concepts of ethics are responsibility and accountability; responsi-
bility means that as free moral agents, individuals, organizations, and societies 
are responsible for the actions they take and should be held accountable for the 
consequences of their actions. The generally accepted view of ethics is that ethical 
behavior resides above behavior required by the law; however, in many respects the 
law and ethics overlap. It is important to realize that the law embodies notions of 
ethics (i.e., the law may be seen as a reflection of what society thinks are minimal 
standards of conduct and behavior). 
Both law and ethics deal with what is deemed right or wrong, but law reflects 
society’s codified ethics. In spite of this overlap, desirable ethical behavior extends 
beyond what is required by law. Viewed from the standpoint of civilized society, the 
obedience to the law is a minimum standard of behavior. In other words, what is 
illegal is definitively also unethical, but what is unethical does not necessarily have 
to be illegal. 
8.4.2  Major Ethical Theories
There are few very influential directions to ethical thinking that most people today 
would recognize. One involves an emphasis upon seeking the best outcome for self. 
Another emphasizes considering the consequences of our actions for everyone who 
will be affected, a third one emphasizes rights and duties, and a fourth one lays 
stress upon the concept of virtue. Some additional ethical theories will be briefly 
described due to their importance to the health care industry and medicine.
Egoism6, also called ethical egoism, is a normative ethical position that is be-
coming increasingly popular, especially in capitalist economic theory. Normative 
forms of egoism make claims about what one ought to do, rather than describe 
what one does do [13]. In this context the egoist is someone who seeks the benefit, 
pleasure, or greatest good for oneself alone [14]. It is quite likely they will be rea-
sonably good neighbors, especially if they have normal friendly human sentiments, 
and also if they believe their lives will be the better for living in a cooperative com-
munity, so they are not as evil as they sound, or as simplistic in their egoism as some 
economists assume. 
An egoist performs in a business or professional environment in a way that 
causes the lack of trust of other people and this practice could be detrimental in 
the long run. This point is currently receiving increasing attention in business and 
professional ethics.
Utilitarianism7, one basic idea held by utilitarianism in common with egoists, is 
that what counts above all from a moral point of view is the consequences of the ac-
tions. What sets utilitarians apart is the principle that they should try to maximize 
the total good consequences (and minimize the bad ones), for all those affected by 
6.	
Max Stirner was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist.
7.	
British philosophers Jeremy Bentham (1748−1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806−1873) were credited with 
the origins of classical utilitarianism, a moral theory that defines a moral act solely in terms of the outcome 
or consequences of that act.

the choices [15]. This theory is often expressed in a slogan: “seek the greatest good 
for the greatest number.” It assumes that it is possible to prioritize values in a rank 
order and understand the consequences of various courses of action. However, it 
looks like a simplistic cost-benefit analysis, in which the end justifies the means.
One common comment about utilitarianism is that it seems to condone pur-
chasing a maximum of total good at the expense of a small number of victims and 
that no action is right or wrong in and of itself. Therefore, actions are only judged 
in light of their consequences.
Consequentialism refers to those moral theories which teach that the conse-
quences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about 
that particular action. Thus, from that standpoint, a morally right action is one 
that produces a good outcome, or consequence, and the utilitarianism and ethical 
egoism mentioned earlier are actually varieties of consequentialism. 
Rights and duties are a very different way of making moral a choice is to em-
phasize rights and duties. Aside from many legal rights and duties, some people 
have thought that there are moral rights and duties as well. One example is the 
so-called natural rights8 listed in the UN Charter. Natural rights, also called inalien-
able rights, are considered to be self-evident and universal, and they are generally 
held to be a gift of nature or God that cannot be taken away [16]. Another is the 
duty to nurture the children, whether the laws of the land require it or not. Those 
who think in these terms will tend to judge the moral status of a situation not ac-
cording to the acceptability of its results, but according to whether it came about 
by the action of proper procedures, such as doing your duty. In contemporary 
theory, these and other moral claims are referred to as universal human rights and 
form the basis for establishing and/or evaluating ethical standards within the social 
order. The idea of human rights is also closely related to that of natural rights.
The idea implied by the name natural rights is that they are moral rights that all 
people have, whether or not any political process has conferred them in the form 
of legal rights. Rights, especially fundamental rights (in United States, fundamental 
rights are part of the U.S. Constitution), are a concept favored by politicians rather 
than philosophers since they have more to do with power than with reason. 
A conflict between two people each claiming different fundamental rights can-
not be resolved in practice, and one has to look deeper than the concept of rights 
in order to find a solution. Therefore, it seems that rights cannot be a truly fun-
damental moral category, and that rights claims can provoke conflict rather than 
solve it. One way to see the problem is that to claim a fundamental right is to say 
that nothing else is ever going to matter enough to count against it, not even things 
you have not thought of yet, sounding almost like a fanaticism. 
Cooray [17] argued that “there cannot be a right without a duty,” and that 
“right in one person presupposes a duty in another.” These days everyone is claim-
ing their rights to this or that, without any regards to the individual responsibilities; 
people demand more and more while contributing less and less.
8.	
Modern notions of natural rights are usually closely associated with the seventeenth-century British phi-
losopher John Locke and his contention that human beings are entitled to life, liberty, and property.

8.4  Ethical and Moral Dilemmas of Technology

Virtues, another view of ethics, come from asking a different question, so in-
stead of asking, what should I do, the question is, what sort of person should I be, 
therefore emphasizing the character of the moral agent rather than rules or conse-
quences. Virtue ethics, which has a very ancient lineage, is enjoying a substantial 
revival in modern times. It provides a way of thinking that is particularly suitable 
for the task of developing one’s character as a good person, hence its title. The idea 
is that every person is constructing his or her own moral character throughout his 
for her life by the history of his or her deeds and decisions. In practice, people who 
think about ethics in this way will often model their behavior on that of exemplars: 
saints or heroes [18]. This is opposed to consequentialism, which holds that the 
consequences of a particular act form the basis for any valid moral judgment about 
that action, and deontologies9, which derives right or wrong from the character of 
the act itself rather than the outcomes.
Altruism10 (also called the ethical altruism) is an ethical doctrine that holds that 
individuals have a moral obligation to help, serve, or benefit others, if necessary 
at the sacrifice of self-interest. Altruism is often seen as a form of consequential-
ism, as it indicates that an action is ethically right if it brings good consequences to 
others. Altruism may be considered similar to utilitarianism; however, an essential 
difference is that the latter prescribes acts that maximize good consequences for all 
of society, while altruism prescribes maximizing good consequences for everyone 
except the actor. Altruism could also be a form of deontological ethics asserting a 
duty, namely to “live for others,” as its principle in spite of whether it has good 
consequences.
Take lying as an example; consequentialists may view lying as wrong because 
of the negative consequences produced by lying but may agree that in some cases 
lying is acceptable. A virtue ethicist would focus less on lying in any particular 
case and instead consider what a decision to tell a lie or not tell a lie says about 
one’s character and moral behavior. A deontologist might claim that lying is always 
wrong, regardless of any potential positive outcome that might come from lying. 
In case of conflict between duties, our actual duty becomes to analyze the situation 
and decide what a right thing to do is (e.g., lying to save the life of an innocent 
person).
Ethics of care is not a common ethical principle but is discussed extensively 
in health profession and specifically with respect to nursing ethics [19]. Universal 
principles are only valid if they can be applied with room for discretionary judg-
ment based on the unique circumstances of each situation. Some of the specific 
standards or ideals within a caring relationship include caring itself, compassion, 
concern, and sensitivity to context. Caution is required here since complete rejec-
tion of impartiality and ethical principles in favor of sensitivity and emotion may 
also lead to a rejection or a neglect of otherwise justifiable obligations and rights.
Some other theories of ethics include absolute values and environmental ethics.
9.	
Deontological ethics, sometimes referred to as duty ethics, places the emphasis on following rules, or doing 
one’s “duty.” Which rules to follow is often a point of contention and criticism in deontological ethics. For 
more information on deontological ethics, refer to the works of Immanuel Kant and Alasdair MacIntyre.
10.	 The word “altruism” was coined by Auguste Comte, the French founder of positivism, in order to describe 
the ethical doctrine he supported. His version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others. This doc-
trine had many opponents, including Friedrich Nietzsche.

8.4.3  Moral Lessons of the Past Research
Many think that the moral lessons learned from the Nuremberg Trials seem so ob-
vious now and that there is no need to study it any further and that it could never 
happen again. That is a wrong conclusion because moral lessons are quickly forgot-
ten and ethics is more fragile than many people think. Moral reasoning based on 
defective premises tends to recur in new settings. For example, not all of the Nazi 
physicians were mentally deranged; they actually believed they were doing the right 
thing. 
The first principle of the Nuremberg Code is that “the voluntary consent of the 
human subject is absolutely essential.” However, this principle was compromised 
almost immediately after the Nuremberg trials; the Helsinki Declaration, which 
superseded the Nuremberg Trials, weakened the provision by placing too much 
emphasis on the advancement of science and not enough on the integrity of the 
subject. Katz in his work [20] faulted the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services Rules and Regulations for a lack of a similar failure fully to protect human 
research subjects. 
In the United States, a series of highly publicized abuses in research led to the 
enactment of the 1974 National Research Act (Public Law 93-348), which created 
the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and 
Behavioral Research. The National Commission was charged with several tasks; 
one task was to identify the ethical principles11 that should govern the conduct 
of biomedical and behavioral research with human subjects. Another task was to 
develop guidelines to ensure that specific investigations would be designed and 
conducted in accordance with these principles. 
The Commission established that informed consent is required; to protect hu-
man subjects who participate in research, they should be given the opportunity 
to choose what will and will not happen to them. The essential components of 
informed consent are information and comprehension. Information is to be given 
to research subjects about the procedure, their purposes, anticipated risks and ben-
efits, alternative procedures, and opportunity to ask questions (veracity, the prin-
ciple of telling the truth). The subject’s comprehension of material is a result of the 
manner in which the information is provided as well as the subject’s intelligence, 
cognitive capability, and language. More information can be found at the Web site 
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Human Research 
Protections (OHRP) [21].
The requirement for truly informed consent is a major reason behind current 
moves to strengthen regulatory mechanisms regarding research involving humans. 
Examples of earlier cases of unethical research behavior that have occurred since 
the Nuremberg Trials are the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the Willowbrook Hepatitis 
Study, U.S. radiation experiments, the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital Study, and 
11.	 The term principle can be defined in several ways; a principle may refer to a basic truth, law or assumption. 
Ethical principles can refer to a generalization that can be used in moral reasoning or a specific rule of good 
conduct.

the lysergic acid study12 supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 
and probably many others that have not been brought to light. In some of these 
cases the initial premise is that law takes precedence over ethics, that the good of 
the many is more important than the good of the few, that national emergencies 
supersede ethics, and that some persons (prisoners in this case) can lose their claim 
to humanity [22]. 
The lesson here is that moral premises must be valid if morally valid conclu-
sions are to be drawn and that a morally repulsive conclusion results from a mor-
ally wrong and inadmissible premise. 
These and some other cases stirred a highly emotional debate on ethics. In ad-
dition, lessons learned can be gathered from some mandatory programs as well. 
A few very well-known examples of mandatory systems/programs targeting hu-
man subjects in United States that were implemented without the consent of the 
individual(s) on which they were performed: 
•• The DoD’s mandatory vaccinations against the biological germ weapon 
called anthrax; in 1998, 16 military members (14 Navy and 2 Air Force) 
while stationed in the Gulf refused to take the anthrax inoculations. As a 
result, two sailors were discharged from the Navy for “disobeying a law-
ful general order.” The others were given 30 days restriction to the ship, 
30 days extra duty, reduction in pay for 1 month and/or reduction in rank. 
The reason given for the two sailors’ dismissal was the inclusion of previous 
discipline problems where they had “demonstrated a pattern of misconduct” 
[23].
•• Several mandatory vaccination programs throughout U.S. history.
•• President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Selective Training and Service Act of 
1940, creating the country’s first peacetime draft. 
Since implementation of the National Research Act in 1974, the process of 
protecting human subjects in the United States has been evaluated periodically 
by various methods. In 1998, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored 
evaluation which concluded that the institutional review board (IRB)-based human 
subjects’ protection system has been implemented in accordance with regulations. 
The NIH, the nation’s medical research agency, includes 27 institutes and cen-
ters and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
It is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and 
translational medical research, and it investigates the causes, treatments, and cures 
for both common and rare diseases.
12.	 Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD or LSD-25), also known as lysergide and colloquially as acid, is a semi-
synthetic psychedelic drug. LSD is nonaddictive and well known for its psychological effects. Introduced 
by Sandoz Laboratories, with the trade name Delysid, as a drug with various psychiatric uses in 1947, 
LSD became a therapeutic agent. In the 1950s the CIA thought it might be applicable to mind control and 
chemical warfare; the agency’s MKULTRA research program propagated the drug among young service-
men and students.

8.4.4  Ethics and Technology Today
One of the major problems in the development, implementation, and operation 
of new technologies is the failure to address social factors, especially ethical issues 
[24]. Most technologies have unintended and sometimes unexpected side effects, 
which, if known in advance, might have altered decisions about their adoption. 
Two schools of thought have developed. One is well known for the dilemma of 
technological (and risk) assessment: in the early development of a technology, when 
it is relatively easy to control its direction, society inevitably lacks the knowledge 
to exercise reasonable control. By the time there is more experience and a better 
understanding of the risks, control has become difficult, if not impossible. 
The other school of thought argues that persons should not be subjected to any 
technological risks until they have a clear understanding of that the risk and have 
granted their consent without being constrained by economic or other external 
pressures. The contention is that the concept of free and informed consent as ap-
plied in the field of medicine is applicable to technology in general and ought to be 
a part of what guides morally grounded public policy.
What is ethical and what is not ethical could be a difficult question. Different 
people will have different answers to the same question; the same people could 
even have different answers today from the answers given five years ago and com-
pletely different answers five years in the future. As recently as 50 years ago, a per-
son would have been considered totally insane to say that in a few years a human 
being would walk on the Moon; jet planes were just becoming commonplace, and 
no rocket had ever been launched, but Sputnik in 1957 started the competition in 
outer space, and the first footstep on the Moon on July 20, 1969 (only 12 years 
later) proved that same person to be a visionary.
8.4.4.1  Engineering Ethics
Whether engineering ethics is an independent field of applied ethics or if it can be 
included in an already existing field has been argued by traditional ethicists and 
advocates of the uniqueness theory. 
Traditional ethicists do not think that there is anything unique about the moral 
problems, for example, privacy, free speech, and intellectual property, which are 
considered by engineering ethicists. These new moral problems, which are associ-
ated with engineering, medicine, and business, according to the traditional ethicists 
can be analyzed by using the traditional ethical theories and categories of morality, 
as discussed in [25].
According to John C. Maxwell, an internationally respected leadership expert, 
speaker, and author [26]:
There’s no such thing as business ethics—there is only ethics. People try to use 
one set of ethics for their professional life, another for their spiritual life, and still 
another at home with their family. That gets them into trouble. Ethics is ethics. If 
you desire to be ethical, you live it by one standard across the board. Educators, 
philosophers, theologians, and lawyers have taken what really is a simple matter 
and made it very confusing. Living an ethical life may not always be easy, but it 
need not be complicated.

8.4  Ethical and Moral Dilemmas of Technology 
305
The opposite side in this debate is the advocates of the uniqueness theory; they 
find that some aspects of engineering ethics are unique since data communications 
ethics issues did not exist before the introduction of computing. Some advocates 
mean that the moral problems associated with data communications cannot be 
analyzed with the traditional morality; instead, there is a need of a new computer 
ethical theory or a new framework of morality.
Of course, different fields can have their specific ethical challenges (profes-
sional ethics): medicine, biotechnology, engineering, and business, but they are all 
intertwined under the common umbrella of ethics. A professional faces several situ-
ations on a daily basis, where the ethical values have to be considered, for example, 
decision-making, where the consequences are significant for both the person who 
makes the decision and the people who are affected by it.
In the case of wireless body implants there are a number of overlapping profes-
sional ethical views (medicine, bioengineering, computer engineering) that may be 
contradicting each other, which makes the situation and decision-making process 
quite challenging. Before the discussion can start on the ethical issues in medicine, 
specifically wireless body implants, a few general terms will have to be defined, 
such as ethics, morality, and conscience, which will be pivotal for this discussion.
In order to address the issues of health and safety that were of concern to en-
gineering during the industrial revolution, a new ethical framework was required. 
The establishment of professional engineering societies in the nineteenth century, 
including the American Society of Civil Engineers (1852), the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (1880), and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers 
(1884), gave ethics a forum in which conflicts could be resolved [27]. The modern 
engineering ethics code development in United States began after World War II, 
as engineers became increasingly aware of the social impact of their work and of 
corresponding social responsibilities. The key characteristic of this period was the 
rise to codified prominence of a new principle recognizing the importance of public 
safety, health, and welfare.
Beginning in the 1970s, individual engineers, especially professors of engineer-
ing, became more involved, often working in tandem with academic philosophers. 
This new phase was stimulated by a series of widely publicized cases perceived as 
examples of engineering negligence or improper subordination to economic inter-
ests and by federal funding for engineering ethics research [28]. The fast-paced 
changes in technology leave decision-makers, legislators, and other major stake-
holders13 with no time for in-depth analysis, and the international community is 
often faced with immediate policy choices that carry serious moral and ethical 
consequences. 
Only recently have philosophers started making direct and sustained study of 
ethics and technology, following two philosophical traditions, each marked by dis-
tinct differences: the continental or phenomenological tradition and the Anglo-
American or analytical tradition.
The continental approach sees technology as a special subject of ethics; because 
technology has fundamentally transformed the human condition, generating prob-
13.	 Every ethical, social, and political issue has stakeholders (i.e., players in the game who have an interest in 
the outcome and usually have vocal opinions).

lems of global magnitude extending into the indefinite future, it calls for a new ap-
proach to ethics. 
According to Hans Jonas, a twentieth-century German-born philosopher, ethi-
cal prospective technology could, in the past, remain in the background because 
technology itself had no high moral purpose. Unlike politics or religion, for in-
stance, technology used to be treated as a marginal aspect of human life, one lim-
ited in both power and effect; by contrast, during the modern period technology 
became a lot more important. 
The Anglo-American tradition does not tend to deal with technology as a 
whole, but looks separately at particular technologies, such as computing, engi-
neering, and medical and biological sciences. It is based on the concepts and prin-
ciples of traditional ethical theory at least as a starting point for analyses. Although 
each of the technologies has a unique set of problems, certain themes, such as 
responsibility, risk, equity, and autonomy, are common to almost all. As opposed 
to the continental approach, philosophers following an Anglo-American analytical 
tradition organize ethical discussions around particular technologies. 
As discussed in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy [29], biomedical eth-
ics studies the ethical implications of the use and development of advanced medical 
technologies; information technology ethics (i.e., computer ethics) examines social 
and ethical significance of computers and high-speed digital networks; engineering 
ethics studies the professional responsibilities of engineers; and environmental eth-
ics evaluates the effects of various technologies on the natural environment.
Invention and application of advanced technologies is commonly evaluated in 
terms of liberty and autonomy. In biomedicine, for example, in the name of liberty 
and autonomy, there is an effort to work out the exact parameters of free and in-
formed consent and then to propose ways to institutionalize them. In the area of 
information technology (IT), liberty and autonomy are key to explaining norma-
tive dimensions of privacy as well as prescribing the extent of freedom of speech 
over the digital networks. 
During the last half of the twentieth century, new fields of ethical reflection 
emerged to deal with the nuclear weapons (nuclear ethics), chemical transforma-
tion of the environment (environmental ethics), biomedical advances (bioethics), 
and computers and IT (computer ethics) so the ethics of scientific research and of 
the engineering practice became specialized areas of study themselves. At the begin-
ning of the twenty-first century, ethical and political challenges became global in 
scope and intensified by the terrorist use of technology and science. 
Ethics, generally speaking, is concerned with identifying proper means and 
distinguishing good and bad ends. Science, technology, and ethics interactions in 
these broad senses have, furthermore, been examined from multiple historical and 
cultural perspectives. The Continental European tradition, for instance, tends to 
focus more globally on science and technology as a whole, whereas in the Anglo-
American tradition dominate [30] the ethics of particular technologies, for exam-
ple, medical ethics or computer ethics, ethics in areas of professional practice such 
as engineering and business, or issues such as equity, privacy, and risk.

8.4.4.2  Efforts to Regulate the Future
In a process of making ethical decisions, it is important to realize that solution often 
means that a reasonable compromise among various requirements is reached. The 
best solution may not be the best technical, best economic, best political, or best 
social, although it should consider all of them.
New technologies and their impact on society was discussed in report prepared 
for the conference prior to EXPO 2000 in Hannover, Germany [31], and over the 
last 10 years of the twenty-first century many of the assumptions and predictions 
started to materialize. 
Many of the new technologies are directly or indirectly related to human 
body, health, and performance, with biomedicine and bioengineering being one 
of the most often discussed. The U.S.-government-sponsored workshop in 2001 
resulted in a detailed document [32] that predicted some of the technology and 
technology-related developments over the next quarter-century (NBIC, short for 
nano-bio-info-cogno):
•• Fast, broadband (human) brain-to-machine interfaces for civilian and mili-
tary purposes;
•• Robots and software operating on principles compatible with human goals, 
awareness, and personality;
•• More durable human body, more resistant to different kinds of stress (physi-
cal and/or emotional), aging, biological threats;
•• Control of the genetics of humans, animals, and plants;
•• International consensus on ethical, legal, and moral issues.
The US-NBIC initiative is technology-driven and is influenced by a perspective 
of national security that emerged after 9/11 and by a vision of competitive security 
and defense for the United States. Considerations of ethical, legal, or social and 
moral issues related to NBIC are to be addressed a posteriori. Also missing are 
considerations of risks and issues. The technocratic understanding of society and 
culture and the vision of a perfect future are also cited as problem areas [33]. One 
crucial subject for the development of the ideas presented in the NBIC report is the 
development of neural implants.
Following the U.S. NBIC Conference, the EU decided to constitute a high-level 
expert group (HLEG). In December 2003, a 25-member group was drawn from a 
variety of countries and disciplinary backgrounds. The group met formally four 
times and submitted its report in July 2004. The European Union developed its 
own definition of converging, EU-HLEG; the definition is broad, but nanotechnol-
ogy, biotechnology, and information technology have central roles.

8.4.5  Enhancing Humans
8.4.5.1  History of Human Enhancement
The racist doctrine of human perfection promoted by Nazis was based on eugen-
ics14, defined by nineteenth-century inventor Sir Francis Galton. Hitler’s lebensborn 
or “life spring” project was supposed to increase the number of blue-eyed, tall, 
blond Aryans15 by mating racially screened women with SS men and officers in the 
German regular army [34]. In the early part of the Nazi era, enforced sterilization 
and legal bans on the intermarriage of superior and inferior humans were the pre-
ferred means of eliminating bad hereditary features; later, death camps were used 
as a more efficient method. 
Even long before Galton, a classic Greek philosopher Plato believed that hu-
man reproduction should be monitored and controlled by the state. Eugenics was 
also practiced in different and less deadly forms in other parts of Europe and in the 
United States16. 
Today scientists know a lot more about genetic engineering, cloning, and so 
forth. In [35] Satava pointed out that humans are the only species on this planet 
with the capacity to direct their own evolution at their own accelerated pace and 
no longer confined by neither the will of nature nor the excruciating slow pace of 
evolution. This may be the ultimate challenge for the next generation of scientists 
and humans in general. It is also critical to realize that technology has no moral 
value; it is neither good nor evil. Rather, it is the application of the technologies 
that raises the moral and ethical issues. 
Supersensory sight could see radar, infrared, and ultraviolet images; augmented 
hearing could detect lower- and higher-frequency sounds. Enhanced smell could in-
tensify our ability to discern scents, and an amplified sense of touch will enable dis-
cernment of environmental stimuli such as changes in barometric pressure. These 
capacities would change the usual standards for humans (i.e., as the numbers of 
so-called enhanced humans increase, today’s normal might be seen as subnormal, 
so the important questions revolve around whether there should be limits placed 
upon modifications of essential aspects of the human species [36]).
For example, kleptomania is the compulsive need to steal what one could af-
ford to buy, and it used to be considered a moral defect requiring counseling or 
punishment or behavior change. Recent research found the biochemical site on the 
brain which is the source of kleptomania so the condition is without question the 
result of a biochemical lesion. 
14.	 Eugenics is the “applied science or the biosocial movement which advocates the use of practices aimed at 
improving the genetic composition of a population,” usually referring to human populations. Eugenics 
was popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, but has fallen into disfavor after having become 
associated with Nazi Germany.
15.	 The term Aryan originates from the Sanskrit word ārya, in origin an ethnic self-designation, in classical 
Sanskrit meaning “honorable, respectable, or noble.” The Aryan race is a concept historically influential 
in Western culture in the period of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, starting with 
the idea that the original speakers of the Indo-European languages and their descendants up to the present 
day constitute a distinctive race or subrace of the larger Caucasian race. While originally meant simply as 
a neutral ethno-linguistic classification, it was later used for ideologically motivated racism in Nazi and 
neo-Nazi doctrine and hence also in other currents such as occultism and white supremacism.

Every mental characteristic, whether it is a matter of personality, cognition or 
emotionality, will eventually be identified as a biochemical process which itself is 
largely genetically determined and hence can be altered. These alterations may be 
pharmaceutical or they may be genetic, acoustic, visual, or by some type of elec-
tronic implants. 
Adderall, a medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)17, 
has become popular among college students who actually do not have the disorder. 
Adderall is the combination of dextroamphetamine18 and amphetamine and works 
like cocaine; those who use it can stay focused and awake for many hours. Students 
with prescriptions commonly sell it or give it away to others. This medication is 
in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants, and it works by 
changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain [37]. 
The U.S. Air Force has been using dextroamphetamine for over 60 years and 
gives them to pilots on long missions to help them remain focused and alert, but in 
December 2003, a new compound, modafinil, was approved for the same purpose 
[38]. It is interesting to note that, although approved by FDA, the exact mechanism 
of how modafinil works is still unknown.
Ritalin (Methylphenidate)19 is a psychostimulant drug approved for treatment 
of ADHD, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and narcolepsy. It may also 
be prescribed for off-label use in treatment-resistant cases of lethargy, depression, 
neural insult, obesity, and sometimes for other psychiatric disorders such as obses-
sive-compulsive disorder. Based on the pool results published in the journal Nature 
in 2009, one in five people reported using Ritalin not as medically intended but to 
increase their brain power (brain boosting).
The first brain implants were surgically inserted in 1974 in the state of Ohio 
and also in Stockholm, Sweden. Brain electrodes were inserted into the skulls of 
babies in 1946 without the knowledge of their parents. According to Esther Mo-
rales, in the 1950s and 1960s, electrical implants were inserted into the brains of 
animals and humans, especially in the United States, during research into behavior 
modification and brain and body functioning [39].
Influencing brain functions became an important goal of military and intelli-
gence services, and mind control methods were used in attempts to change human 
behavior and attitudes. Today implants are small enough to be inserted into the 
neck or back and also intravenously in different parts of the body during surgical 
operations, with or without the consent of the subject, and it is almost impossible 
to detect or remove them. 
Aside from the ethics of implanting devices in a human body, there is also an 
ethical dilemma of who is responsible for removing or turning off these devices 
[40]. Implantable devices have a long history in medicine, with artificial hips being

implanted since 1925, pacemakers since 1957, Starr-Edwards heart valves since 
1961, artificial hearts since 1982, and ventricular assist devices since 1991. The 
ethics of deactivation or removal of these devices were not an issue until the use of 
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device, as the ICD can produce con-
siderable distress from defibrillation shocks in end-of-life patients. 
8.4.5.2  Today’s Definition of Human Enhancement
The definition of what exactly is enhancement is not very clear, since it is not clear 
what constitutes “normal.” In the United States, the President’s Council on Bioeth-
ics defines human enhancement as going “beyond therapy” (i.e., not just becoming 
healthy again but exceeding the normal, healthy state). Humans have always sought 
to enhance themselves; ancient Olympians ate mushrooms for improved success in 
their events, and Renaissance women wore corsets to slim their waists [41]. These 
days a plastic surgery offers a number of surgical procedures with a goal of improv-
ing the appearance of men and women. 
Today, the human performance modification (enhancement) includes many dif-
ferent scientific disciplines such as learning, psychology, neurology, and pharma-
cology, as well as focused research in sleep and cognition, and development of pros-
thetics and treatments for spinal cord damage. In spite of the serious reasons for 
these areas of research, there is the potential for abuses, as well as serious concerns 
about a point at which changing natural humanity begins. Such ethical consider-
ations should and will appropriately limit the types of activities and applications in 
human performance modification. 
In the future, brain technology might go beyond helping sick, for example, 
offering behavior modifications for the people who are short-tempered, have no 
sense of humor, or are too emotional. Beyond that is the possibility of enhancing 
people’s cognitive processes, enabling them to think more clearly, to have better 
command of arithmetic, to have a better memory for faces, to be more generous 
and loving, and so forth. Of course, relief from these conditions will not be ac-
cessible to everyone since they probably will not be cheap; this is one of the most 
important ethical challenges of all.
These changes in human nature could become even more emphasized in the 
case of children. Rich parents in an intensely competitive society may be able to 
secure implants for their children and most likely change the already unequal op-
portunities in life. The major concern should be the social impact of implementing 
a technology that widens the divisions not only between individuals, but also be-
tween rich and poor nations, as well as the possibility that it could facilitate control 
of humans. The ethical principle of equity is suggesting that everybody should have 
fair access to the benefits under consideration.
On the other side of the debate are those who claim that using new technolo-
gies to enhance native human capacities is not different from the old technologies 
[42], such as using clothes to enhance human skin or shoes as enhancement of hu-
man feet.
Using these new technologies, commercial interests or governments could con-
trol and monitor citizens. In a free society this possibility may seem remote, although 
it is plausible to project initial compulsory usage for children, for the military or 
for criminals (as it is already happening with some simple RFID applications). 

8.4  Ethical and Moral Dilemmas of Technology

Policy decisions will arise about this usage and also about mandating implants to 
affect specific behaviors. The main question is who will control the technology and 
what will be programmed so the prospects for invasions of liberty and privacy are 
alarming.
From Birth to Death and Bench to Clinic: The Hastings Center Bioethics Brief-
ing Book for Journalists, Policymakers, and Campaigns contains 36 overviews of 
issues in bioethics of high public interest, such as abortion, health care reform, hu-
man and sports enhancement, organ transplantation, personalized medicine, medi-
cal error, and stem cells. In addressing the question of potential threats that may 
arise from adversarial activities in human performance modification, the single 
most important factor is awareness, with the ability to assess the significance of 
the developing applications, the Hastings Center, created in 1969, is a nonpartison 
research institution dedicated to bioethics and public interest.
In bionics, the future is in the creation of artificial muscles and nerves, mak-
ing it possible for progressive technological integration into the body, eventually 
replacing or augmenting the structures that mediate the various physical and men-
tal attributes that people normally consider “natural” to human beings, including 
emotion, natural sensory modes, rational thought, and properties of imagination. 
It is clear that the severely disabled are often the first to appreciate the fruit-
ful couplings of humans and machines. A brief discussion with anyone who has 
a pacemaker, a new hip, a hearing aid, an artificial heart, or any one of a host 
of bionic devices will show that. The neural prosthetic and interface technologies 
of today can be broken down into three major areas: auditory and visual pros-
thesis, Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation (FNS), and prosthetic limb control 
via implanted neural interfaces. So far, the most successful implants have been in 
the realm of hearing, and there are thousands of people worldwide outfitted with 
cochlear implants. Although current versions of these devices may not match the 
fidelity of normal ears, they have proven very useful. 
In a Medical Ethics magazine [43], Ellen M. McGee, a retired adjunct profes-
sor of philosophy and presently an ethics consultant, described the future that may 
include the reality of science fiction’s cyborgs, persons who have developed some 
intimate and/or necessary connection with a machine. It is likely that computer 
chips implanted in our brains and acting as sensors or actuators may soon not 
only assist the blind and those with failing memory, but even provide fluency in 
a new language, enable recognition of previously unmet individuals, and provide 
instantaneous access to encyclopedic databases. Some others claim that even today 
humans already are cyborgs of a sort.
U.S. federal agencies are involved in national security and medical research as 
well. For example, one of them is DARPA, with its funding of unclassified studies 
conducted at various universities, described by Jonathan D. Moreno, a professor of 
medical ethics, history and sociology of science, and philosophy, in [44]. Included 
in such work is a conventional prosthetics research but also an effort to have ma-
chines and brains communicate in order to improve real-time human performance 
in battle. 
A similar program is AugCog (augmented cognition), which tries to eliminate 
the boundary between artificial and natural intelligence. The helmets would sense a 
soldier’s emotions and then transmit appropriate combat orders based on telemetric 
findings. These devices could potentially rob combatants of autonomous behavior 

312 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
(i.e., free will) conceivably depriving them of making ethical choices. These efforts 
are linked to other DARPA programs to improve the soldier’s endurance, alert-
ness and vigilance, fear response, and pursuit of a hypercourageous, but probably 
judgment-impaired, soldier.
There are different thoughts on the possibility of the future intelligent machines 
and/or cyborgs. In his paper J. Sorrs Hall [45] argued that a society including 
super-ethical machines would not only be better for people to live in, but stronger 
and more dynamic than human society is today, so not only should humans give 
consciences to the machines whenever possible, but creating machines that exceed 
humans morally as well as intellectually is required. 
8.4.5.3  The Limitations of Human Enhancements
Over the last few years, human enhancement has become an important topic of 
debate in applied ethics. In previous chapters of this book, technical achievements 
of modern biotechnology were discussed in which medicine, science, and engineer-
ing are working together to extend our longevity as well as to enhance life’s quality. 
Living to be 120 years old and be able to play tennis at that age is an ultimate goal 
of the life-enhancing techniques; sitting for 30 years in a wheelchair, maybe without 
even recognizing one’s closest family members any longer, is definitely not what 
society should be striving for. 
Longevity without the quality of life is meaningless. In addition, all phases of 
life should be prolonged, not just the retirement age; it is hard to imagine people 
having the same length of their youth and working through a productive middle 
age, but having an extended retirement and old age to last 50 to 60 years. In either 
case, it will require a very different social structure of the society in which people 
will be living.
Although small steps towards enhancing our lives and extending it have to be 
analyzed very critically and very carefully due to the safety and security issues, the 
wheel of progress cannot be stopped. Over the last few thousand years, humans 
have significantly improved and extended lives more than doubly; it is hard to 
imagine lives without surgeries, medications, prosthesis, and other modern marvels 
of technology and medicine, without which humans would probably go back to the 
life expectancy of 25 or maybe 30 years of age. From that prospective, the human 
race has already been enhanced. 
The environment in which people are living and the way they (and all other 
creatures on Earth) are living their lives determines the longevity; they are not 
determined just by nature (or God) itself, if at all. Therefore, it is not arrogant or 
unnatural or unethical to strive towards further improvements and enhancements 
of our bodies and our beings.
This is a very new and promising technology for improving the quality of peo-
ple’s lives as well as extending them. On the other hand, a vision of body organs, 
including the heart and brain, being able to communicate with the outside world 
and exchange information and being radio controlled by the outside controller, can 
be frightening. Here, less of the concern lies in the conspiracy or government-run 

8.4.6  Ethical Decision-Making Process 
313
programs than in the potential misuse and abuse by the greed of corporations and 
criminals.
The Latin saying noli me tangere (a warning against touching or interfering) 
was still very much practiced in 1944, when Dr. Alfred Blalock performed his first 
heart surgery. The heart was something not to be touched while people were dy-
ing from all kinds of heart-related ailments. Many of his colleagues at the Johns 
Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, did not even wish to assist Dr. Blalock 
in performing such a groundbreaking surgery. Open heart surgeries, heart trans-
plants, artificial hearts, and heart pace-makers followed over the next 60 years, 
ensuring that humans live longer and better. So why should the brain not be the 
next logical step?
The brain is a much more complex organ than heart; the heart can be analyzed 
(and modeled) as a little bit more complicated mechanical device, perhaps as a 
pump, while the brain is a combination of numerous and very complex electronic 
circuits about which scientists still do not know much. Therefore, electronic chip 
implants are not only required as a therapeutic tool but also as a research instru-
ment that will help scientists to better understand the human brain. In view of 
these potentially great implications of the implantable brain chip, its development 
and implementation should definitely be regulated, after an open dialogue that will 
ensure that everyone’s needs and concerns are being addressed.
Even the experts disagree; while some think that there should be no limitation 
on how people can choose to modify themselves, others think that the technology 
should be regulated, treated as research on human subjects, and closely monitored 
for its effects. The common concern is the use in the military, prisons, and for chil-
dren or other individuals whose power to make decision (informed consent) might 
be limited or completely nonexistent. Being able to decide when and if something 
will be done to our bodies, as well as being able to offer the same opportunity to 
everyone, are crucial parts of the process. 
8.4.6  Ethical Decision-Making Process
8.4.6.1  Basic Principles
We might say, according to John Bordley Rawls, a twentieth-century American phi-
losopher and a leading figure in moral and political philosophy, that the principal 
aim of ethics is the formulation of justifiable principles that may be used in cases 
wherein there are conflicting interests to determine which one of them should be 
given preference [46]. When a decision is made about what is ethical (right, just, 
fair) using the conventional approach, three key elements described next go into 
such a decision. 
First, observing the behavior, act, or practice that has been committed or is 
about to happen and that the comparison of the practice with prevailing norms 
of acceptability, that is, society’s or some other standard of what is right or wrong 
(Figure 8.3). In other words, ethical principles provide a common framework that 
individuals who hold differing normative positions can adopt when debating an 
issue. 

314 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
It is important to recognize that value judgments are being made by someone 
with his or her personal opinion and bias towards the judgment outcome (subjec-
tivism). This means that two different people could look at the same behavior, com-
pare it with their concepts of what the prevailing norms are (i.e., different ethical 
principles), and reach different conclusions as to whether the behavior was ethical 
or not, and none of them has to necessarily be wrong. This becomes quite complex 
as perceptions of what is ethical inevitably lead to the difficult task of ranking dif-
ferent values against one another. 
Decisions that include ethical dilemmas can quickly become very complex. 
Generally speaking, members of society generally agree at a very high level that cer-
tain behaviors are wrong; however, the consensus tends to disintegrate when faced 
with the not abstract but specific, real-life situations. The most serious danger is 
that of falling into an ethical relativism in which people pick and choose which 
source of norms they wish to use based on what will justify their current actions or 
maximize their freedom. 
There are numerous implications and consequences of advanced technologies, 
and these issues fall into several categories: scientific (is the science really safe?), 
social (what are the societal implications?), behavioral (how will individuals’ be-
havior change?), political (how will the legal and regulatory systems react?), and 
philosophical (what fundamental moral and ethical values are challenged?). 
According to LaRue Hosmer, professor emeritus of corporate strategy [47], 
five important points should be made about the character and nature of ethics and 
decision making:
•• They have extended consequences;
•• They have multiple alternatives;
•• They have mixed outcomes;
Figure 8.3  Ethical judgment process.

8.4.6  Ethical Decision-Making Process 
315
•• They have uncertain consequences;
•• They have personal implications.
It is a very complex task to decide whether a new and advanced technology is 
ethical and morally acceptable, since not all of the implications of the new tech-
nologies can be foreseen or predicted at the time of their development. The ethical 
implications of application of wireless body implants in neuroscience are new chal-
lenge, since the ability to intervene in the brain in many ways is a recent under-
taking. Therefore, it is critical to identify the components likely to challenge our 
conventional thinking and investigate their social, behavioral, political, moral, and 
ethical implications. 
Some critics would claim that some of the body implant technologies cannot be 
accomplished and/or perfected in the next two to three decades, but the issues are 
so important that even longer time spans may be inadequate for us to prepare for 
the potential consequences. 
The intimate relation between bodily and psychic functions is basic to person’s 
personal identity. Neurosciences are developing very quickly, and the brain im-
plants developed to alleviate tremors in Parkinson’s disease are only one example. 
They show that body implants may influence the nervous system and particularly 
the brain and thus human identity, as well as individual subjectivity and autonomy.
8.4.6.2  Organizational Ethics Decision-Makers
The creation of hospital ethics committees in the 1980s reflected a need on the part 
of hospitals to establish some mechanism to deal with those clinical dilemmas and 
policy issues that revolved around the appropriate use of medical technology. There 
is general agreement on the (usually) threefold function of such committees: case 
consultation, policy recommendation, and education, although institutions vary in 
their approach to these functions. 
Some committees are heavily represented by hospital administration or hos-
pital counsel and maintain a defensive posture for the institution, while others 
actively exclude such individuals. Some committees are largely physician commit-
tees and their deliberations represent that perspective. Maybe the best approach is 
to attempt to establish a broad-based, multidisciplinary approach and also include 
nurses, social workers, clergy, and academic ethicists from philosophy or the social 
sciences [48]. 
The most common function of ethics committees is to provide clinical case con-
sultation. There is a wide variation in approach (i.e., style and methodology) from 
one committee to another. While it is still common for full committees to inter-
view patients and their families and/or other parties, smaller consultation teams or 
subcommittees are becoming more common. In fact, the solitary ethics consultant 
model has been used in a number of institutions with some success. 
Regardless of which model is used, an important question remains about 
authority and expertise. Moral authority in a committee setting is often a result 
of a consensus; the authority of an individual consultant is a reflection of his or 
her training and expertise and these will remain vague and elusive concepts until 
such time that there are accreditation organizations to evaluate such individuals. 

316 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
Professional organizations such as the American Society for Bioethics and Humani-
ties20 [49] should play an important role in the development of such standards. 
Over the past few years businesses have also become more proactive in seek-
ing to protect themselves from future scandals, and sometimes it seems that many 
companies are obsessed with ethics programs and compliance; the increased aware-
ness of and need for ethical behavior are making a difference. Business leaders 
supporting ethical behaviors and communicating values are critical to a company’s 
ethics. If a company’s underlying values do not reward ethical behaviors, then an 
opportunity has been missed that sets the company up for future problems. 
A good ethical decision-making process requires the ability to explore all the 
aspects of a decision and then to weigh the options surrounding a course of action. 
Ask yourself these questions: If you had to explain your decision on television, 
would you be comfortable doing so, and if you had to do the same thing over 
again, would you do anything differently? In a corporate world, this is the role of 
the chief ethics officer (sometimes called the chief ethics and compliance officer) 
who acts as the point person to steer all levels of employees toward integrating eth-
ics into decision-making processes and codes of conduct. 
The reporting structure is very important when it comes to ethics; the ethics of-
ficer must be independent in order to be effective, so ideally, the chief ethics officer 
should report directly to the CEO (but not CFO) or the board’s audit committee. 
The analysis of the interests and opinions could be a very effort-making and 
time-consuming process. In the case of wireless body implants, there are a number 
of interested parties (stakeholders) involved in the ethical decision-making pro-
cess. Organizations developing wireless body implants and/or applied technology 
should have a person onboard to coordinate these efforts.
8.4.6.3  Stakeholders and Their Involvement
The society typically desires the benefits of science without exposing themselves 
to any risk; however, there are few human activities that are completely risk-free. 
Effort is needed to improve public education about minimal risk approaches as op-
posed to no risk approaches and about risk analysis. It is important to recognize 
that every scientific advance will be questioned for its value in both “good” and 
“bad” applications, regardless of how these are judged.
It is difficult to envision the situation where a complete consensus will ever be 
obtained; there are potential or actual hazards to every scientific discovery and/
or technological application and a certain compromise has to be made. One way 
to address this conflict is to require that safeguards be put in place to protect the 
public from the malicious use and/or the well-intentioned but incautious use (i.e., 
misuse) of science and technology.
All species in nature strive to do things better and faster, but there is one impor-
tant difference that set humans apart from all other species in nature, the capability 
to restrain themselves and make a conscious decision whether to do something 
20.	 The American Society for Bioethics and Humanities is a professional society of more than 1,500 individu-
als, organizations, and institutions interested in bioethics and humanities. It was founded in 1998 by the 
merger of the Society for Health and Human Values, the Society for Bioethics Consultation, and the Ameri-
can Association of Bioethics.

or not. Just because humans can do something, it does not mean they should. 
William “Bill” Ernest McKibben is an American environmentalist and writer who 
frequently writes about global warming and alternative energy and advocates for 
more localized economies. In his books and articles he covers this topic extensively 
from the environmental position [50]. 
McKibben belongs to a group of so-called bioconservatives who are generally 
opposed to the use of technology to modify human nature. A focal idea in bio-
conservativism is that human enhancement technologies will undermine human 
dignity. On the other side of the spectrum are so-called transhumanists, who be-
lieve that human enhancement technologies should be made widely available, that 
individuals should have broad discretion over which of these technologies to apply 
to themselves, and that parents should normally have the right to choose enhance-
ments for their future children [51].
Langdon Winner, a professor of humanities and social sciences and a political 
theorist who focuses upon social and political issues that surround modern tech-
nological change, offers three guidelines about how to start “real life” (sometimes 
called “lifeworld”) discussions [52]:
•	 No engineering without political deliberation. And that would necessitate ethi-
cal and social deliberation as well. Who gets what and why are questions that 
need to be addressed.
•	 No means without ends. Clearly established and meaningful goals need to be 
discussed and agreed upon before any design, development, production, or dis-
tribution gets under way.
This is a good starting point for a discussion about new technology and its de-
velopment, but it needs further explanation. Winner emphasized the importance of 
incorporating all stakeholders in a decision-making process; determining who the 
stakeholders are and how to incorporate them are sometimes difficult questions to 
answer and could lead to a completely new discussion. In addition, sometimes in-
ventions are created without unique purposes (i.e., meaningful goals) in mind, but 
once accepted in real life, users come up with appropriate applications.
8.4.7  Mathematical Modeling of Ethical Decisions
According to William Starbuck, “Decision implies an end of deliberation and the 
beginning of action.” Typically, decision-making process consists of five steps: the 
initiation step (i.e., the recognition of the need), the problem-defining step, the 
system-modeling step (mental, graphic, physical, or mathematical), the analysis and 
evaluation step, and the implementation (and reevaluation) step. Without reevalu-
ation this is an open-loop process, while the process that includes observation of 
the results and return to problem-defining step is called a closed-loop process [53].
There are two mental (cognitive) approaches typically used in decision-making 
and problem-solving processes: intuitive and analytical [54]. In many cases, intui-
tive decisions are not supported by data and documentation and may appear arbi-
trary, and many decisions (probably too many) today are of the intuitive type. The 
person charged with making the decision collects information, probably biased by 
his or her own values, and after some thinking makes a decision. Over the years, 

318 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
researchers from different scientific disciplines have contributed to the understand-
ing of the human actions and decisions21.
Some of the reasons why decision-makers should not rely just on the subjective 
and intuitive decision-making process are:
•• Humans are not very good at making complex, unaided decisions;
•• Individuals respond to complex decisions by using intuition and/or personal 
experience to find the easiest solution;
•• Teamwork may not be helpful, and groups can devolve into entrenched posi-
tions resistant to compromise;
•• The temptation is to think that honesty and common sense will suffice, and 
that may or may not be the case.
On the other hand, analytical decision-making, when used collectively, leads 
to decisions with which most stakeholders can agree. Generally speaking, every 
decision-making problem is defined by the presence of multiple alternatives; when 
the feasible set of alternatives of a decision consists of a finite number of elements 
that are explicitly known in the beginning of the solution process, it creates an im-
portant class of problems called the multicriteria evaluation problems. 
8.4.7.1  Decisions and Decision-Making
The goal of the multicriterial decision analysis (MCDA) methods is to define priori-
ties between alternatives (actions, scenarios, projects) according to multiple criteria, 
allowing for more in-depth analysis of the problem because they consider various 
aspects. MCDA methods use partly mathematical hypotheses and partly informa-
tion gathered from the decision makers and stakeholders. 
MCDA methods utilize a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical 
approach for integrating risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, which enables 
evaluation and ranking of many alternatives. Within MCDA, almost all method-
ologies share similar steps of organization and decision matrix construction, but 
each methodology synthesizes information differently. Most problems involve four 
separate hierarchies: benefits, costs, opportunities, and risks.
There is a large number of methods used for the multicriterial decision analysis, 
for example, the analytic hierarchy process, Bayesian analysis, multiattribute util-
ity/value theory (MAU(V)T), and outranking methods. Different methods require 
different types of value information and could follow various optimization algo-
rithms [55].
Deliberative multicriteria evaluation (DMCE) combines the advantages of mul-
ticriteria analysis in providing structure and integration in complex decision prob-
lems with the advantages of deliberation and stakeholder interaction and conflict 
resolution provided by the use of the community reference panel or citizens’ jury 
[56].
21.	 Sigmund Freud’s work on the unconscious suggests that people’s actions and decisions are often influenced 
by causes hidden in the mind; in their book on game theory, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern 
describe a mathematical basis for economic decision-making.

8.4.6  Ethical Decision-Making Process 
319
Some techniques rank options, some identify a single optimal alternative, some 
provide an incomplete ranking, and others differentiate between acceptable and 
unacceptable alternatives. Unfortunately, many methods assume independence of 
criteria and alternatives in their formulation; often real-life problems involve mu-
tual dependencies that cannot be neglected by always assuming independence. 
The choice of which model is most appropriate depends on the problem at 
hand and may be to some extent dependent on with which model the decision-
maker is most comfortable. It is important to remember that applying different 
MCDA methods on a same problem and using the same data may yield different 
results. 
8.4.7.2  Analytic Hierarchy Process
It is important to take a systematic and well-organized approach to making serious 
decisions in problem solving that also involves ethics. When selecting a methodol-
ogy to address an ethical dilemma related to a new technology, as in wireless body 
implants, there is an aim to achieve several objectives. The method should improve 
understanding of the problem as well as simplify the judgment process so that the 
complexity of the dilemma does not compromise the quality of the decision. In 
addition, it should enhance the ability to examine and explain and/or defend the 
decision. 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was developed by Thomas L. Saaty 
(born 1926 in Iraq), an American mathematician, in the 1970s, and published in 
1980 and 1994, as a decision-making tool involving building a hierarchy (i.e., rank-
ing) of decision elements and then performing comparisons between each possible 
pair in each cluster as a matrix and initially described in [57]. This gives a weighting 
for each element within a cluster (or level of the hierarchy) and also a consistency 
ratio, useful for checking the consistency of the data. The AHP provides a means of 
making decisions or choices among alternatives, particularly where a number of ob-
jectives have to be satisfied (i.e., multiple criteria or multiattribute decision-making).
Looking at the hierarchy from top to bottom (Figure 8.4), the AHP structure 
comprises goals (systematic branches and nodes), criteria (evaluation parameters), 
and alternative ratings (measuring the adequacy of the solution for the criterion). 
Each branch is then further divided into an appropriate and desired level of detail. 
At the end, the iteration process transforms the unstructured problem (sometimes 
with subjective data only) into a manageable problem organized both vertically 
and horizontally, under the form of a hierarchy of weighted criteria. 
The selection of the criteria for the project estimation is a very important part 
of the proposed method. When the number of criteria increases, the importance of 
each criterion is reduced. Level 0 is the goal of the analysis, while Level 1 is a multi-
ple criteria that consist of several factors. There could be more levels of subcriteria 
(Level 2) and subsubcriteria added. The last level, Level 3, is the alternative choices. 
An important aspect in structuring a hierarchy is that any element in a level 
can be compared with respect to some elements in the level immediately above. The 
hierarchy does not have to be complete (i.e., an element at an upper level need not 
function as a criterion for all the elements in the lower level). It can be partitioned 
into nearly disconnected subhierarchies sharing only a common topmost element.

Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
The analyst can insert and delete levels and elements as necessary to clarify the task 
or to focus on one or more areas of the system.
Here n elements are considered with the goal of providing and quantifying 
judgments on the relative weight (or importance) of each element with respect to 
all the other elements. The first step is to set the problem as a hierarchy, where the 
topmost node is the overall objective of the decision, while subsequent lower-level 
nodes consist of the criteria used in arriving to this decision. The alternatives, from 
which make a pick, are bottom level of the hierarchy (i.e., the n elements that are 
to be compared). 
One of the major strengths of the AHP is the use of pairwise comparisons to 
derive accurate ratio scale priorities, as opposed to using traditional approaches of 
assigning weights, which can also be difficult to justify. According to Ishizaka and 
Labib [58], psychologists claim that it is easier and more accurate to express one’s 
opinion on only two alternatives than simultaneously on many alternatives; thus, 
the pair-wise comparisons are made by answering the question: Of two elements i 
and j, which is more important (or larger) with respect to the given factor and how 
much more? 
Tobias Dantzig (1884–1956), who was born in Latvia and studied mathemat-
ics with Henri Poincaré in Paris, in his book first published in 1930, claimed that 
most people (and even some animals) could compare two objects and determine 
that one is larger than the other [59]22. Most people can easily compare two objects 
against each other (ability of human mind referred to as fuzzy differentiation, also 
22.	 This sense for numbers should not be confused with counting, which involves a different and rather intri-
cate mental process.

called qualitative assessment), but they might have difficulty in effectively compar-
ing many objects in a pairwise fashion against multiple criteria.
One of the important features of the AHP is that it deals with opinion and 
hunch (“gut feeling”) as well as other intangibles as easily as with facts; in other 
words, both qualitative and quantitative criteria can be compared using informed 
judgments to derive weights and priorities. Although other decision-makers can 
adopt other weights and even other criteria, the sources of disagreements can be 
clarified, debated, and negotiated in a more coherent manner by relying on an ex-
plicit model.
In the AHP, each element in the hierarchy is considered to be independent of 
all the others, meaning that the decision criteria are considered to be independent 
of one another, and the alternatives are considered to be independent of the deci-
sion criteria and of each other. However, in many real-world applications, there is 
interdependence among the elements and the alternatives. The analytic network 
process (ANP) is a more general form of the AHP or, in other words, the AHP is a 
special case of the ANP. It is also known as the systems-with-feedback approach, 
as described in [60] by Saaty. 
Medical applications have been quite common during the last decade; for ex-
ample, in [61] the performance of two medical treatment options, using AHP, was 
evaluated. A few years earlier, at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, AHP 
was used in a pilot study to help determine who should receive an organ transplant 
[62]. Using pairwise comparisons, a set of criteria for children receiving organ 
transplants was evaluated using the AHP. The study was able to take into account 
ethical, qualitative, and quantitative factors to determine who should receive organ 
transplants. 
The study determined that such factors as the patient’s ability to pay23, medical 
insurance, or financial or economic status should not be considered in making a 
transplant decision and the physical limitations, such as being disabled, should not 
be a determining factor for an organ transplant. The conclusion of the study was 
that the most important criteria would be the patient’s ability to survive the dif-
ficult transplant process, accept the difficult transition process following an organ 
transplant, and lead a relatively normal life after the organ transplant. 
One of very few applications of AHP dealing with ethical decision-making was 
published in [63]. This paper briefly described a simplified process of selecting the 
most ethical course of action, taking into consideration consequentialism, consis-
tency, and duty. Consequentialism was subdivided into minimal harm and egoism, 
while duty was subdivided into be-true and right-to-know. Accommodating mul-
tiple stakeholders and modeling uncertainty were also addressed in the same paper. 
8.4.7.3  Group Decision-Making
A group is two or more individuals who are connected to each other by some type 
of social relationship. Group dynamics is the study of groups and also a general 
term for group processes. The scientific study of groups began around the 1890s 
as part of the new growing field of social psychology. Because they interact and 
23.	 This is most likely a result of Canada’s national health care system, assuring health care for all Canadians.

322 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
influence each other, groups develop a number of dynamic processes that separate 
them from a random collection of individuals. These processes include norms, roles, 
relations, development, need to belong, social influence, and effects on behavior. 
Group decision is usually understood as aggregating different individual pref-
erences on a given set of alternatives to a single collective preference. It is assumed 
that the individuals participating in making a group decision face the same com-
mon problem and are all interested in finding a solution or an answer to that 
problem. A group decision situation usually involves multiple decision-makers, 
each with different skills, experience, and knowledge relating to different aspects 
(criteria) of the problem. Consensus forming is usually a critical part in the group 
decision-making process [64].
Not all the groups are wise and capable of making smart decisions; according 
to Dr. James Michael Surowiecki, an American journalist [65], these key criteria 
separate wise groups from irrational ones:
•• Diversity of opinion: Each person should have his or her own opinion;
•• Independence: People’s opinions should not be determined or influenced by 
the opinions of those around them;
•• Decentralization: People are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge;
•• Aggregation: Some mechanism must exist for turning private judgments into 
a collective decision.
Usually if the group is working together in a decision-making session and some 
judgment or judgments seem to be on the opposite side from the majority, math-
ematical models and methods are of little help. If the final outcome of the analysis 
differs from the expectations, which are usually based on intuition and/or experi-
ence, the cause of deviation has to be researched. Neither intuition nor mathemati-
cal model is necessarily wrong, but perhaps some important factors are not consid-
ered or given sufficient attention [66].
It was said [67] that: “Consensus is good, unless it is achieved too easily, in 
which case it becomes suspect.” In other words, some disagreement between par-
ties involved is a good thing, since it can lead to a healthy discussion and improve 
odds for correct decision. When the group is not on the same page in terms of un-
derstanding the problem, or maybe they are on opposite sides of the issue, conflict 
resolution, negotiation, and facilitation are required. 
Feedback among the participants in the decision-making process could be 
achieved by conducting a brainstorming, using the structured communications pro-
cess known as a nominal group technique (NGT)24 or applying a Delphi technique25.
24.	 The nominal group technique is a decision-making method with the idea to make the decision quickly, but 
with everyone’s opinions taken into consideration. First, every member of the group gives his or her view of 
the solution, with a short explanation. Then duplicate solutions are eliminated from the list of all solutions, 
and the members proceed to rank the solutions: first, second, third, fourth, and so on. This technique was 
originally developed by Delbecq and VandeVen in 1970s.
25.	 Delphi technique was developed by the research group at the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, Califor-
nia, in 1969 to obtain the most reliable consensus of opinion from a group of individuals about a dilemma 
that had no objective resolution.

8.5  Review Questions and Problems

8.5  Review Questions and Problems
1.	 Last week, Edward B. Someone tried out a brand-new wireless LAN card 
on his laptop at work. He did not expect anything to happen, because 
his organization’s wireless LAN was not up and running yet. But to his 
surprise, he was able to connect without any trouble to the network of an 
office down the street. Oops!
	
  Discuss the fact that space around us is full of radio frequencies contain-
ing data and proprietary, as well as personal, information. Was Edward 
committing a crime by accessing someone else’s network? Discuss the dif-
ferent scenarios and outcomes.
2.	 Think about and discuss the following statement:
	
“How would you like it if, for instance, one day you realized your under-
wear was reporting on your whereabouts?” (California State Democratic 
Senator Debra Bowen, at a 2003 hearing)
	
  With what other famous (and erroneous) statements in the history of 
science and technology can you compare this statement? Two similar ex-
amples are given here:
•	 “There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.” (Ken 
Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corpora-
tion, 1977) 
•	 “640k memory ought to be enough for anybody,” (Bill Gates, Microsoft 
founder, 1981)
3.	 One concern of RFID technology is that UHF tags can be read wirelessly 
up to distances of 30 feet (HF tags can be read at less distance, but still 
wirelessly). Tags can obviously be removed and destroyed after purchase, 
but that makes returning a product or recalls more difficult. The Gen 2 
protocol offers a kill command to deactivate tags, but tags that are killed 
cannot be revived. 
	
  One novel idea is to use a so-called clipped tag that gives consumers the 
option of privacy protection by allowing them to tear off perforated sec-
tions that hold parts of the tags’ antennas, reducing their read ranges to 
only a few inches. This provides a visible means of enhancing privacy pro-
tection and allows for later use of the tag for returns and recalls. Discuss 
this idea and list its pros and cons.
4.	 Does RFID enable tracking people by satellite? Do you think that someone 
could covertly read the contents in a shopping bag?
5.	 Consumers have concerns about the privacy and use of their personal in-
formation. Many of the companies and organizations promoting the use 
of RFID have or are developing policies addressing consumer notice and 
privacy. However, it is important to remember many applicable consumer 
protections are already written into law. For example, retailers are already 
restricted in the sale or distribution of consumer information, and secure 
computer systems and data encryption schemes are already in place for the 
electronic transfer of private data. 
	
  There are already federal guidelines in place that address many of these 
concerns, including the Privacy Act (1974), the Electronic Communications 

324 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
Privacy Act (1986), the Telecommunications Act (1996), Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (1996), and the Financial Moderniza-
tion Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 2000), among others. Do you think 
that we need new, RFID-specific, legal protections? 
6.	 AIM Global has instituted an image called the RFID emblem that acts as 
a visual indicator to consumers and retail workers to help them find and 
identify the presence (and type) of RFID tag in a label, tag, or item. Some 
think that this is a sufficient self-regulation of the industry; what is your 
opinion? What other measures, if any, would you suggest in order to fur-
ther protect consumers privacy?
7.	 Besides consumer goods, RFID technology can be beneficial in other ap-
plications (preventing drug counterfeiting and reducing tampering, alerting 
staff to wandering patients in retirement homes, locating lost children in 
public places, and finding stray animals). Do you believe these positive uses 
can counter skepticism about the privacy invasion of RFID? Explain your 
answer.
8.	 Here are a few examples, mentioned earlier in this chapter, of systems/pro-
grams in the United States that were implemented without the consent of 
the individual(s) involved: 
•	 The DoD’s mandatory vaccinations against the biological germ weapon 
called anthrax; 
•	 Several mandatory vaccination programs throughout U.S. history;
•	 President Franklin Roosevelt’s signing of the Selective Training and Ser-
vice Act of 1940, which created the country’s first peacetime draft. 
	
  These examples stirred a highly emotional debate on ethics among many 
people and a few lessons learned can be gathered from these mandatory 
programs. 
	
  Speculation continues to grow as to which groups of the human popula-
tion will have microchips introduced into their bodies to test the feasibility 
of the concept and for further future implementation. Some have eluded to 
the fact that eventual human microchip implantation is coming and is pos-
sible. These people believe that it will first be on a volunteer basis and then 
the government will intervene, making it mandatory in the penal system 
and the military and later in the general public as well. Discuss the topic in 
detail.
9.	 It has been long predicted that RFID and sensors would be combined, 
whereby a sensor gathers environmental information that is stored on an 
accompanying RFID tag. In February 2007, the Web site http://www.New-
Scientist.com discovered a recently filed patent application by Kodak that 
outlines a new application for RFID ingestible tags that act as monitors for 
health characteristics within the human body. The idea is that the RFID tag 
antenna could be composed of organic material that would dissolve as a re-
sult of certain chemical reactions within the human body. Once dissolved, 
the tag antenna, and therefore the tag itself, would stop transmitting a 
signal, indicating that the targeted chemical reaction had occurred. Kodak 
calls them fragile tags.

8.5  Review Questions and Problems 
325
	
  For example, imagine an RFID reader-equipped drug dispenser installed 
in the home bathroom of a patient. The patient is prescribed to take a pill 
every day, which is issued by the dispenser. Once the pill is issued, the dis-
penser’s RFID reader activates and begins polling for the signal of a tag, 
which is physically attached to the dispensed pill. In this uningested state, 
the tag functions properly, responding to the RFID reader’s interrogation, 
which, in turn, informs the dispenser that the day’s dosage has not yet been 
taken. 
	
  Once the patient ingests the pill/tag, the organic tag antenna is subjected 
to chemicals within the patient’s stomach. The tag antenna was designed to 
rapidly dissolve in the presence of normal stomach chemicals, so after only 
a few minutes it does so, and the tag ceases to respond to the RFID reader 
signal, which the dispenser interprets as the patient having taken his or her 
daily medication. 
	
  The concept could be applied to changes in mechanical states as well. 
Discuss an application in which a tag may be affixed to an artificial or 
natural body part and when worn on the body part, for example, an artifi-
cial hip, has proceeded to a predetermined level, the tag is rendered useless, 
thus alerting the remote query that the body part has achieved an unsatis-
factory level of wear.
10.	Could RFID ever lead to massive layoffs of workers?
11.	Analyze and discuss the following statement, taken from [68]:
The Smart Human Environment will completely change the way we inter-
act with our environment and with each other. People will communicate 
with their technological environment naturally, using a variety of modali-
ties and devices. The environment will be aware and will understand the 
user’s social, physical and situational context. The environment will be able 
to smartly assist the user in his tasks, based on this context awareness and 
knowledge of the user’s behavioral profile as well as common sense knowl-
edge. It will exhibit pro-active behavior for recurring tasks and provide per-
sonalized information services.
12.	What are some of the most important ethical issues engineers could face 
during the development of a medical device? Should engineers be concerned 
about ethical issues regarding medical implants they are working on? If 
not, who should be the one to analyze the problem and make a decision 
on how to proceed? If yes, how should engineers approach this dilemma? 
Please elaborate your answers. 
13.	Many may regard the employment of neural implants as a technological 
progress, accept the new technology, and welcome it, while others may be 
horrified just thinking about it. People from different cultures and ethni-
cal backgrounds may also respond differently. Discuss the opinion of the 
society where you live and their possible reaction to this very radical, new 
technology. 
14.	Who will drive forward the technological development of wireless body 
implants, and who will control its implementation? Should it be left in 
the hands of commercial concerns, which could easily be dangerous to so-
ciety, or should political entities be responsible? Should military and/or 

326 
����������������������������������������������������������
Sociocultural Implications of RFIDs and Their Applications
government deployment be regulated and overseen? An issue of misuse by 
large corporations and criminals comes to mind as well. Discuss the topic.
15.	Research different methods for the conflict resolution in a group decision-
making situation. What would the selection of the appropriate method de-
pend on? What are the factors we have to consider when deciding who will 
be involved in the making the final decision regarding the problem at hand?
16.	The development of ethics for implanted devices is critical as the techno-
logical advances in implantable devices will soon produce a huge number 
of patients with implanted devices in an end-of-life situation. Who has the 
right to turn off the device; does the doctor have the right to turn it off, 
against the patient’s wishes, for reasons of futility; does the patient have the 
right to turn it off, against the doctor’s wishes, and if so, for what reasons? 
Who else could be authorized to turn off the implanted devices?
17.	Why do you think that it is important that the chief ethics officer in an 
organization reports directly to the CEO (but not the CFO) or the board’s 
audit committee? Where do you see conflict of interests arising?

x is the base of a logarithm and base 10 is most commonly used in radio commu-
nications. Base 2 and the base of natural logarithms e are used sometimes as well.
Complex Numbers
A complex number, Z = R + jX, has a real part R, and imaginary part X. Here, j is 
the imaginary unit, 
1
j =
- . In mathematics, i is used for the imaginary unit, but in 
electrical engineering j is used in order to avoid confusion with the alternating cur-
rent, whose symbol is also i. Complex numbers can be shown in a two-dimensional 
complex plane.

Vectors and Vector Operations
Vectors are three-dimensional quantities. The dot product of two vectors A and B 
can be defined as follows:
	
cosθ
=
A B
A B

	
If the angle θ is zero, A and B are in parallel and the dot product has a maxi-
mum value. If the angle θ is 90°, A and B are orthogonal and the dot product is 
equal to zero.
The cross-product of two vectors A and B can be defined as follows:
	
ˆ
sin
n
θ
×
=
A
B
A B
	
The resulting vector is orthogonal to A and B, and ˆn  is a unit vector normal to 
the plane in which A and B reside. If the angle θ is 0° or 180°, meaning that A and 
B are parallel, the cross-product is zero. If the angle θ is 90°, meaning that A and 
B are orthogonal, the cross-product of these two vectors has a maximum value.
Decibels
The decibel unit is commonly used in radio communications because the direct 
relationship between radio-related power levels covers a wide range of numerical 
values. The logarithmic nature of the relationship between two power levels results 
in values that are easy to handle.
The abbreviation for decibel, dB, has a capital B since a bel was derived from 
Alexander Graham Bell’s last name. Addition or subtraction operations can be eas-
ily performed on logarithmic values, simplifying the handling of amplification and 
attenuation. In addition, humans perceive differences in the sensory impressions of 
varying intensity in a logarithmic fashion.
The decibel is used to compare one power (or voltage level) to another:

A word of caution about dBm: We cannot add dBm to dBm.
The two powers must first be converted to milliwatts and then added and the 
sum reconverted to dBm. For example:

We know that doubling the power means 3-dB increase in decibels. Thus, as a

Access control  An RFID application in which RFID tag–equipped badges are 
used to provide secured access to a facility.
Active tag  A type of RFID tag that contains an internal power source and, in 
some cases, also a radio transceiver. These additional component(s) are used to 
enhance the effective read/write range, and rate of data transfer characteristics of 
the RFID tag. 
Adaptive frequency agility  Technique that allows an interrogator to change its 
frequency of operation automatically from one channel to another.
AIM Global  The worldwide trade association of components and systems pro-
viders for automatic identification, data collection, and data integration in man-
agement information systems. Its members are manufacturers or service providers 
of identification technologies, such as RFID, bar code, smartcard, and biometrics.
Amplitude modulation (AM)  Representation of data or signal states by the am-
plitude of a fixed-frequency sinusoidal carrier wave. When data is in binary form, 
the modulation involves two levels of amplitude and is referred to as amplitude 
shift keying.
Amplitude shift keying (ASK)  Representation of binary data states, 0 and 1, by 
the amplitude of a fixed-frequency sinusoidal carrier wave. When the amplitudes 
are determined by the carrier being switched on and off, the process is known as 
on-off keying (OOK).
Antenna  A conductive structure specifically designed to couple or radiate electro-
magnetic energy. In a driven mode the structure is a transmitter antenna. In receiver 
mode the structure is a receiver antenna. Antenna structures, often encountered in 
RFID systems, may be used to both transmit and receive electromagnetic energy, 
particularly data-modulated electromagnetic energy.
Antenna gain  The measure of the amount of signal that the antenna radiates or 
receives. It is given as a decibel ratio, compared to a theoretical omnidirectional 
antenna called an isotropic antenna. All other things being equal, a high-gain an-
tenna will transmit and receive weaker signals farther than a low-gain antenna. 
Omnidirectional antennas, such as a dipole, will have a lower gain than directional 
antennas because they distribute their power over a wider area. A half-wave dipole 
antenna will have a gain of near 1, or nearly equal the isotropic antenna.

tion is a system wherein two different methods are used to authenticate; using two 
factors as opposed to one implies a higher level of security).

Wiegand format  The most common data format in an access control system con-
sisting of 26 bits of information.
Write  The transfer of data to a tag. The tag’s internal operation may include read-
ing the data in order to verify the operation.
Write broadcast capability  An RFID technology characteristic that allows data to 
be written to multiple tags while those tags are within an RF portal.
Write once read many (WORM)  A transponder that can be partially or totally 
programmed once by the user and thereafter only read.
Write rate  The rate at which data can be transferred to a tag, written into the tag’s 
memory, and verified as correct. It is measured in bits (or bytes) per second.
