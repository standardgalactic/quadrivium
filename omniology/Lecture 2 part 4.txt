‚Ä¢ When the input/output curve over your variable is interesting.
‚Ä¢ How to quantify interesting?
When have you found a good feature or features?

Goodness measure:    DKL(P(sf|spike), P(sf))
Tuning curve:           P(spike|sf) = P(sf|spike) P(spike) / P(sf)
sf
Boring: spikes unrelated to stimulus 
P(sf|spike) 
P(sf)
sf
Interesting: spikes are selective
P(sf|spike) 
P(sf)
When have you done a good job?
Introducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
DKL(P(s),Q(s))) = ÔÉ≤ds P(s) log2 P(s)/Q(s)

Choose filter in order to maximize DKL between 
spike-conditional and prior distributions
Equivalent to maximizing mutual information between 
stimulus and spike
Does not depend 
on white noise inputs
Can be used
