EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD FROM
THE EDITOR
Nur Atifi | PC.com Editor
H
appy New Year to all our loyal readers – 
2017 is here! Out with the old, in with 
the new: a saying that holds true whether 
you’re listing down your New Year’s 
resolutions or shopping list for the latest 
tech products. Every January we’ll see a flurry of new 
product announcements, what with the coveted CES 
happening. The latest and greatest within the consumer 
tech industry – the who’s who, if you will, are in Las 
Vegas. Do check out our First Look: CES 2017 Special to 
see some nifty products that caught our attention. 
Speaking of New Year’s resolutions, our Gizmos this 
month features just some of the many gadgets that 
you can grab your hands on to help you along the way. 
Don’t forget to read all about our thoughts on the many 
products we got our hands on – Tested is definitely the 
place to be if you’re still deciding on which gadget to 
buy…or you know, just to simply reconfirm your choices. 
On a more serious note, our Cover Story this month 
touches a trend that we’d like to see die off. Fake news 
stories permeating the social media space, and worst of 
all, many fall prey – like intended by creators – to them. 
We speak about the era of Post-Truth and how some 
companies are trying to curb it. Don’t forget to read 
some useful tips on how to identify these fake news 
stories as well. 
As always, our Gametime section is exciting as ever. 
Read all about our writer’s endeavours in trying to play 
three, yes you read that right, different games at the 
same time. He’s done well so far, so let’s not waste his 
efforts. 
We wish you a Happy New Year once again.Till next 
time…
 
Happy reading.

Thank you for your question Eric! If you’re looking for incredible graphics with 4K resolution, the PS4 Pro is 
an obvious choice. But if you’re tight on budget and space, the PS4 Slim is a good alternative. Hope this helps 
and have fun gaming!
You’re in luck as webe is currently having a 
promotion where you only have to pay RM79 
monthly for unlimited Internet data, calls and SMS.
That is a good question Faisal! Lucky for you, we just 
reviewed the OKI MC573DN printer which I think will suit 
your needs perfectly. Flip to page 68 on this month’s issue 
to see what we have to say about it.
I want to get a second line for my son, which 
telco do you recommend?
I’m looking to get to get a small and affordable printer 
for my home office, what can you recommend?

amers rejoice! If 
you’re sick and tired 
of having to use up 
data on your smartphone 
just to act as a Wi-Fi hotspot when 
you game, worry not as U Mobile has 
got you covered with its Game-Onz plan. 
Thanks to Game-Onz, you can now game 
without eating into your current data plan as 
Game-Onz gives you unlimited data access so 
you can game anytime, anywhere!
U Mobile’s Game-Onz comes in three 
different plans, all of which are affordable 
for the everyday gamer. The first plan costs 
RM18 and can last up to 7 days while giving 
you unlimited gaming data as well as 500MB 
worth of high speed data. You will also receive 
unlimited Music-Onz data. The second Game-
Onz plan costs RM50 but is capable of lasting 
up to 30 days! However, it comes with 10GB of 
gaming data and you also get 2GB worth of high 
speed data and unlimited Music-Onz data.
The last Game-Onz plan is worth RM70 and 
it can also last up to 30 days. The difference 
is that this plan comes with unlimited gaming 
data, 4GB high speed data and unlimited Music-
Onz data. Sure doesn’t seem like a bad price to 
pay for all those perks.
As of right now, Game Onz supports 3 
different gaming platforms – Steam, Garena 
G
and Playone Asia 
– where it can support 
7 games in total so far but the list will be 
increasing soon! The 7 games are Dota 2, 
Counter Strike:Global Offensive (CSGO), League 
of Legends (LoL), FIFA Online 3, EOS, Team 
Fortress 2 and Blackshot.
In terms of purchasing the Game-Onz 
data plan, U Mobile has made sure there are 
plenty of ways to enjoy its plans. The first 
way is through the MyUMobile app where 
you can select from which of the three plans 
you’re interested in buying. The second way is 
through the USSD code, much like topping up 
mobile prepaid credit. Simply key in *118# or 
*118*3*5#. From there, you will be brought to 
the UMB main menu display where you can 
then choose which Game-Onz plan you want to 
purchase. The last method is through SMS by 
keying in either GO18, GO50 or GO70 to 28118. 
To check your balance, key in 118*3*5*3# or 
through the MyUMobile 
app.
You can also purchase 
game credits through the 
MyUMobile app on 4 different 
gaming 
platforms, 
mainly 
Steam, Garena, Playone Asia 
and MOL. For Steam, you get 
5 different choices of RM7, 
RM13, RM26, RM65 and RM125 
for Steam Wallet codes worth 5, 10, 
20, 50 and 100 respectively. For Garena, 
you get 3 different choices of RM10, RM20 
and RM30 for Garena Shells worth 142, 285 
and 428 shells respectively. For Playone Asia, 
you have 4 different choices to choose from – 
RM10, RM20, RM30 and RM50, which entitles 
you Playcash credits worth 250, 500, 750 
and 1,250 respectively. Lastly, through MOL, 
you have up to 6 different choices to choose 
from RM3, RM5, RM10, RM20, RM30 and 
RM50 where you can then redeem MOLPoints 
worth 195, 325, 650, 1,300, 1,950 and 3,250 
MOLPoints respectively. 
Visit u.com.my/game-onz for more 
information about U Mobile’s Game-
Onz plan.
Gamers can now have unlimited
data to game all day and night long.

hildren will be children, and while 
parents and guardians may advise 
and remind them about safety online 
behaviours, they generally do not listen.
Based  on the 2016 Internet Service Providers 
(ISP) group study,  74 per cent  of Malaysian 
parents think that there is a need for their children 
to be protected online. 
The question is, ‘How’? 
PC.Com caught up with Ms. Sylvia Ng, General 
Manager, Kaspersky Lab – SEA to find out how 
Kaspersky Lab can better protect and manage 
children’s safety online. 
What are the threats faced by children on the 
Internet? 
Everything could be a threat for kids because 
they are too trusting, and more easily caught up by 
social engineering schemes. 
To be more quantitative, a recent survey 
conducted by Kaspersky Lab and B2B International 
over a 12-month period indicates 22 per cent of 
children were affected by cyber incidents. 
We can categorize these cyber incidents into 
three factors.  
First, threats from strangers; sexual predators, 
sextortion and fraud. Next, threats from friends 
i.e cyberbullying, pranks and sextortion. Third, 
threats from the children themselves; oversharing, 
sexting, bullying and downloading or sharing 
illegal content.
What can parents do?
The key  is to ‘communicate’; nothing beats 
open face-to-face chats. 
C
By talking as a mentor, you can teach your 
kids what is socially acceptable or otherwise. 
Kids should feel comfortable coming to you as 
their parents first, when and if they do something 
wrong. 
However, parents would realise that for 
many kids, while they listen, they don’t always 
implement. This is why it is important to educate 
ourselves and find the best tools to protect kids 
from  online dangers, such as Kaspersky Safe 
Kids. 
What is Kaspersky Safe Kids?
Kaspersky Safe Kids is a new multi-platform 
service that can create a safeguarded digital zone 
for kids.  It is available for Windows, Mac, Android 
and iOS.
What are the key features of Kaspersky Safe 
Kids?
Kaspersky Safe Kids protects kids from 
inappropriate websites and objectionable 
communications. It sends reports to your 
phone when your children search, read or 
watch something you don’t like them to read 
or watch, all in accordance with the settings 
you’ve preset.
Use Safe Kids to set up safe zones, which are 
familiar to your children and where you expect 
them to be. Kaspersky Safe Kids lets you track 
their location via GPS in real time. If they leave this 
place you’ll instantly get a notification.
Get onto safer access for kids, and more peace 
of mind for parents via Kaspersky Safe Kids.

in Malaysia with an open beta service 
for Maybank cardholders in the country. 
It is  available to users with Maybank Visa debit,

Samsung smartphones for a limited time. 
The introduction of the mobile payment service 
is in response to consumer demands in Malaysia 
where 89% of Samsung Galaxy smartphone 
users expressed interest in using Samsung Pay 
once it becomes available. This was based on a 
report commissioned earlier this year by Samsung 
Malaysia Electronics, in which 200 Malaysian 
consumers were surveyed about their interest in 
Samsung Pay.
“We are excited to offer a preview of Samsung

f you thought Lenovo were done

the new year with. Lenovo introduces 
four new smartphones into its

Aside from its introduction, Lenovo

reached 110Mbps download speeds 
but it aims to provide a much better 
service to its customers with the help 
of its equipments partners from Huawei

“Mobility networks aren’t just 
about coverage and speed. It is about 
how we can optimise the experience 
for everyone by using data we already 
know and making smart choices about 
the type of technology we deploy 
and where we deploy it,” shares 
our Chief Technical Officer, Shurish 
Subbramaniam. “webe is the only 
network in Malaysia able to deploy 
both FDD850MHz for improved indoor 
network penetration and TDD2300MHz 
to provide overall good user experience. 
We combined these technologies so 
that users get the best of both user 
experience and coverage.”
Shurish adds: “Giving people the 
best network experience is about really 
understanding where and what their 
needs are. It’s a little bit like highways. 
If we had all the money and space in 
the world, we could just build highways 
everywhere. But that’s not an option; 
instead, we need big highways with 
multiple lanes for areas where there is 
a lot of usage, and smaller but longer 
roads to cover the areas where few 
people go.
“Ultimately, users just want to 
get where they want to go quickly 
and hassle-free. Just like our mobile 
network, we need to give them fast 
connectivity to do what they love to do

omething major happened in October. 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices were 
exploited by cybercriminals and turned 
into a rogue and malevolent army. A 
series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attacks affected websites connected to the cloud-
based internet performance management company 
Dyn, including Amazon, Twitter, Reddit, Spotify and 
PayPal. It’s possibly a watershed moment.
“We have been shown just how vulnerable 
the internet – which is now an integral part of 
the critical infrastructure of the US and many 
other countries – is to disruptive abuse conducted 
at scale, by persons whose identity is not 
immediately ascertainable,” ESET’s Stephen Cobb 
concluded in his analysis of the event.
Now, with Christmas upon us and the 
increasingly volatile world markets never more 
dependent upon online transactions, everyone is 
desperate to stop repeat attacks.
1. Wait, What’s iot?
Definitions vary, but the ‘Internet of Things’ refers 
to ‘smart devices’ like refrigerators that will tell 
us when we’re out of milk. But also, many smaller 
less outlandishly smart objects, such thermostats, 
coffee machines and cars. These gadgets are 
embedded with electronics, software, sensors and 
network connectivity so that they can connect to 
the internet.
2. so, What’s the problem?
Anything that connects to the internet, even if 
it doesn’t contain your medical records, poses a 
s
risk. The 21 October attacks were made possible 
by the large number of unsecured internet-
connected digital devices, such as home routers 
and surveillance cameras.
The attackers infected thousands of them 
with malicious code to form a botnet. Now, this is 
not a sophisticated means of attack, but there is 
strength in numbers. They can be used to swamp 
targeted servers, especially if they march in all at 
once.
3. hoW did the attacks 
actually happen?
Remember that bit in the instruction manual where 
it told you to change the default password? Well, if 
you didn’t, then chances are your IoT device could 
spring to life as a cyber zombie. The DDoS-attackers 
know the default passwords for many IoT devices 
and used them to get in. It’s a bit like leaving your 
house keys under a flowerpot for anyone to find.
Anyone putting an IoT router, camera, TV or 
even refrigerator online without first changing the 
default password is enabling attacks of this type. 
Recent ESET research suggests at least 15% of 
home routers are unsecured – that’s an estimated 
105 million potentially rogue routers.
4. Wait, do i need iot devices?
Some people dismiss IoT devices as gimmicky; 
others believe that in a few years we’ll all have 
smart cupboards that tell us what we can have 
for dinner. But there are numerous discernible 
benefits, such as the sensors in smartphones and 
smartwatches that provide real information about 
our health. Or the “blackbox” telematics in cars 
which can prove how safe or unsafe our driving is 
and thus help with insurance claims.
5. so, this is a neW problem?
Nope. The possibility for exploitation of this kind 
has been common knowledge since, well, the 
dawn of IoTs. But, we didn’t realise quite how 
vulnerable we were until October. Malicious 
code infecting routers is nothing new, as this 
ESET research clearly demonstrates.
The advice to change the default passwords 
on these devices is definitely not new and has 
been reiterated many times. Yet you can lead 
a horse to water, but there’s no making them 
drink. Two years ago, WeLiveSecurity reported 
on the existence of 73,000 security cameras with 
default passwords.
6. hoW far does it go back?
The IoT actually goes way back as far as the 
1980s. But in a slightly Back to the Future 
iteration. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
University first came up with an internet-
connected Coke vending machine in 1982.
7. surely, internet giants 
have the poWer to stop 
this?
Sure they do, but that doesn’t mean some of 
them haven’t left gaping holes available for 
malicious exploitation. At the Black Hat security 
conference last year, security research students 
from University of Central Florida demonstrated

flaW exploited
As many as 900,000 Deutsche Telekom 
customers were knocked offline on Sunday 
and Monday as an attempt was made to hijack 
broadband routers into a botnet.
Malicious hackers are commandeering 
vulnerable Zyxel and Speedport routers, 
commandeering them into a botnet which they 
can command to launch huge denial-of-service 
attacks against websites. 
In this particular case, an attack was able 
to fool the vulnerable routers into downloading 
and executing malicious code, with the intention 
of crashing or exploiting them. Compromised 
routers could then be commanded to change 
their DNS settings, steal Wi-Fi credentials, or

Home Network Protection includes hacked 
router detection and a list of devices on your

to malware used to launch distributed denial-
of-service attacks (DDoS). This feature can 
identify a hacked router. It also provides you 
with an easy-to-access list of connected 
devices, with devices categorised by type (e.g. 
printer, router, mobile device, etc.), to show you 
who is connected.

how they could compromise Google’s Nest 
thermostat within 15 seconds.
Daniel Buentello, one of the team members, was 
quoted as saying in 2014: “This is a computer that 
the user can’t put an antivirus on. Worse yet, there’s 
a secret backdoor that a bad person could use and 
stay there forever. It’s a literal fly on the wall.”
8. What can i personally do 
to stop this?
Look at IoT devices like any other computer. 
Immediately change the default password and 
check regularly for security patches, and always 
use the HTTPS interface when possible. When 
you’re not using the device, turn it off. If the device 
has other connection protocols that are not in use, 
disable them.
These things might sound simple, but you’d be 
alarmed by how easy it is to opt for convenience 
over good sense. Only half of respondents to this 
ESET survey indicated that they’d changed their 
router passwords.
9. What can companies do 
to stop this?
You might think, ‘What’s the point? If an attacker 
can breach Amazon, then what hope does my firm 
have?’ Well, don’t give up hope. Organisations 
can defend against DDoS attacks in a range of 
ways including boosting the infrastructure of 
their networks and ensuring complete visibility of 
the traffic entering or exiting their networks. This 
can help detect DDoS attacks, while ensuring 
they’ve sufficient DDoS mitigation capacity and 
capabilities. Finally, have in place a DDoS defense 
plan, which is kept updated and is rehearsed on a 
regular basis.
Think of it like a fire drill for your network. 
Also, watch out for Telnet servers. These are the 
dinosaurs of the digital universe and as such should 
be extinct, because they’re so easily exploited. 
Never connect one to a public-facing device.
10. but … and this is a big 
but …
The tech might have been around for a while but 
these kinds of attacks are brand new. As such there 
are no agreed best practice protection methods for 
stopping an IoT from turning against you.
At least, not ones that the experts can agree on. 
Some believe you should apply a firewall in your 
home or business and to regulate control of them 
to authorised users. However, another method 
would be to apply a certification approach: allowing 
only users with the right security certificate to 
control the devices and automatically barring any 
unauthorised profiles. If in doubt, unplug it. 
to scare victims into paying up after (falsely) 
accusing them of harvesting illegal content on 
their devices.
ESET experts have also documented Android 
ransomware spreading via email. Attackers 
used social engineering to manipulate victims 
into clicking on a malicious link in the message 
and directed them to an infected Android 
application package (APK).

COVER 
STORY
L
et’s face it: the way we consume 
media has drastically changed 
over the years. Long-form news 
is now an arbitrary choice, and 
sensationalistic headlines catch the 
attention of social media users. 
My lecturer once told me that 
“news isn’t news, if it’s not new”. 
I’m inclined to believe that what he 
meant didn’t entail the mass users 
of social media just reading off 
headlines, and not the actual article. 
With the fast-paced environment 
we live in now, everyone wants to 
be in the know; be someone who 
disseminates information, whether 
useful or not. It’s like a game of 
Chinese Whispers: some parts of 
the information could be skewed or 
totally and utterly deviated from the 
original content. This is a world we 
live in now. A world where fake news 
are liberally peppered amidst real 
content, making it harder and harder 
for the masses to differentiate the 
two. 
 So it’s hardly surprising when 
Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 
2016 is post-truth. The adjective is 
defined as relating to or denoting 
circumstances in which objective 
facts are less influential in shaping 
public opinion than appeals to 
emotional and personal belief. 
How do you tell apart satirical or made-up news, with honest 
to goodness news reports? Fake news…who do you trust?
Fact or 
Fiction?

Post-Truth Era
According to Oxford Dictionaries, 
rather than simply referring to the 
time after a specified situation or 
event – as in post-war or post-
match – the prefix in post-truth has 
a meaning more like ‘belonging 
to a time in which the specified 
concept has become unimportant or 
irrelevant’.
“A book, The Post-truth Era, by 
Ralph Keyes appeared in 2004, and 
in 2005 American comedian Stephen 
Colbert popularised an informal 
word relating to the same concept: 
It’s hard to fathom why readers 
are more captivated with these 
fake news stories, rather than 
reading the likes of New York Times, 
Washington Post, Huffington Post, 
and NBC News among others. 
BuzzFeed News also cited that 
20 top-performing false election 
stories originating from hoax sites 
and hyperpartisan blogs managed 
to generate more than 8 million 
shares, reactions and comments 
on Facebook alone. The number 
is staggering, and the top 5 fake 
stories on Facebook are even more 
truthiness,” it shares. “(Truthiness 
is) defined by Oxford Dictionaries as 
‘the quality of seeming or being felt 
to be true, even if not necessarily 
true’.”
This was further cemented during 
the UK Brexit and more recently, the 
presidential election in the US. In 
an analysis by BuzzFeed News, the 
top-performing fake election news 
stories on Facebook generated 
more engagement than the top 
stories from major US news outlets 
in the final three months of the US 
presidential campaign.

“In this bizarro world, political 
adversaries resemble comic book 
villains, a large space rock threatens 
Earth and one celebrity dies daily

Discovering What’s Real
So how do you tell apart what’s real, 
and what’s utterly rubbish? Snopes 
believes that “so long as social 
media allows for the rapid spread of 
information; manipulative entities will 
seek to cash in on the rapid spread of 
misinformation.”
Post US elections, Facebook has 
come out with a statement to curb 
the dissemination and sharing of fake 
new stories.
“The bottomline is: we take 
misinformation seriously. Our goal is 
to connect people with the stories they 
find most meaningful, and we know 
people want accurate information. 
We’ve been working on this problem 
for a long time and we take this 
responsibility seriously. We’ve made 
significant progress, but there is 
more work to be done,” says Mark 
Zuckerberg, CEO and Co-Founder of 
Facebook. 
 “The problems here are complex, 
both technically and philosophically. 
We believe in giving people a voice, 
which means erring on the side of 
letting people share what they want 
whenever possible. We need to be 
careful not to discourage sharing 
of opinions or to mistakenly restrict 
accurate content. We do not want 
to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but 
instead rely on our community and 
trusted third parties.”
It is currently testing ways to make it 
easier for its users to report a hoax 
if they see one on the social media 
platform. As with many of its reporting 
and bug fixing efforts, Facebook is 
encouraging its community to help it 
on this issue on a bigger scale. 
“We have relied on our community 
to help us understand what is fake 
and what is not. Anyone on Facebook 
can report any link as false, and we 
use signals from those reports along 
with a number of others -- like people 
sharing links to myth-busting sites 
such as Snopes -- to understand which 
stories we can confidently classify as 
misinformation. Similar to clickbait, 
spam and scams, we penalise this 
content in News Feed so it’s much less 
likely to spread,” he adds. 
In the statement, Zuckerberg also 
highlights some of the projects that 
Facebook is undertaking on this front:  
•  Stronger detection
Improving its ability to classify 
misinformation. This means better 
Easier reporting

technical systems to detect what 
people will flag as false before they do 
it themselves.
•  Easy reporting 
Making it much easier for people 
to report stories as fake will help us 
catch more misinformation faster.
•  Third party verification
There are many respected fact 
checking organisations and Facebook 
has reached out to some to learn. Adam 
Mosseri, VP, News Feed, Facebook 
shares: “We believe providing more 
context can help people decide for 
themselves what to trust and what 
to share. We’ve started a programme 
to work with third-party fact checking 
organisations that are signatories of 
Poynter’s International Fact Checking 
Code of Principles.”
•  Warnings
It is exploring labelling stories that have 
been flagged as false by third parties or 
our community, and showing warnings 
when people read or share them.

•  Related articles quality
Facebook is raising the bar for stories 
that appear in related articles under 
links in News Feed.
•  Disrupting fake news economics
A lot of misinformation is driven 
by financially motivated spam. 
It is looking into disrupting the 
economics with ads policies and 
better ad farm detection. “We’ve 
found that a lot of fake news is 
financially motivated. Spammers 
make money by masquerading as 
well-known news organisations, 
and posting hoaxes that get people 
to visit to their sites, which are 
often mostly ads. So we’re doing 
several things to reduce the 
financial incentives. On the buying 
side we’ve eliminated the ability to 
spoof domains, which will reduce 
the prevalence of sites that pretend 
to be real publications. On the 
publisher side, we are analysing 
publisher sites to detect where 
policy enforcement actions might 
be necessary,” says Mosseri.
•  Listening
It will continue to work with 
journalists and others in the 
news industry to get their input, 
in particular, to better understand 
their fact checking systems and 
learn from them.
“Some of these ideas will work 
well, and some will not. But I want 
you to know that we have always 
taken this seriously, we understand 
how important the issue is for our 
community and we are committed 
to getting this right,” Zuckerberg 
comments at the end of his statement. 
In the same vein, tech giant 
Google is working towards prevent 
its Google ads from being placed 
on websites that misrepresent 
content. It says in a statement: 
“Moving forward, we will restrict ad 
serving on pages that misrepresent, 
misstate, or conceal information 
about the publisher, the publisher’s 
content, or the primary purpose 
of the web property.” It however 
doesn’t outline its policy change, 
unlike Facebook. 
The Malaysian Story
The move by Facebook is considered 
timely, given that Malaysia has seen 
its fair share of fake news stories 
making its rounds on social media 
platforms. We even have our local 
version of satirical news portal, 
fakemalaysianews.com – our very 
own The Onion. 
According the 2016 Reuters 
Institute Digital News Report, 69% 
of Malaysians get their news from 
social media. Yet a large number 
of them can’t tell the difference 
between real and fake news. 
Of course, not all hoaxes get 
disseminated 
through 
Facebook. 
Whatsapp has been a popular 
choice for propaganda makers. Even 
local politician Lim Kit Siang agrees 
that Malaysia is now in an era of 
fake news, false cartoons and false 
allegations.
In a blog post, Lim shares that the 
Penang Chief Minister’s Office had 
to deny a Whatsapp message on 14 
December 2016 with a photograph of 
the Penang Chief Minister that Lim 
Guan Eng had supported the action 
against the Rohingya community in 
Myanmar.
“The Chief Minister’s special 
assistant Zaidi Ahmad, lodged a 
police report on the fake news and 
said the whole objective of the fake 
Whatsapp message was a racialist 
slander to incite religious sentiments 
against the Chief Minister,” says Lim. 
“In actual fact, at the Penang 
Chief Minister’s initiative, the recent 
Penang State Assembly unanimously 
passed a motion condemning the 
atrocities against the Rohingyas.”
Thus it isn’t surprising that 
Malaysians are just not careful and 
gullible in terms of the news they 
read. Local newspaper reports that 
the Malaysian Communications and 
Multimedia Commission (MCMC) 
held media literacy classes for about 
900,000 people this year at 700 
1Malaysia Internet Centres (PI1M), 
showing them examples of fake 
stories involving MH370, celebrity 
news and the US presidential 
election.
It was very shocking to them 
that most participants can’t tell the 
difference. Eneng Faridah Iskandar, 
MCMC advocacy and outreach senior 
director shares in the same news 
report: “The (fake) websites are not 
even as sophisticated as those in the 
United States, but as long as it reads 
like something from a newspaper, 
they can’t tell the difference 
“People are beginning to wise 
up (to fake news) but it can’t 
happen without a focused education 
programme. We have a high user and 
penetration rate, but we are still not 
media-literate.” 
Education will have to start from 
you – a proactive stance is needed 
to make sure that you are consuming 
the right (and real) kind of information 
and news. Melissa Zimdars, author of 
‘False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and 
Satirical “News” Sources’ shares her 
tips on analysing news sources: 
•  Watch out for websites that end 
in “.com.co” as they are often fake 
versions of real news sources  
•  Watch out if known/reputable 
news sites are not also reporting on 
the story. Sometimes lack of coverage 
is the result of corporate media bias 
and other factors, but there should 
typically be more than one source 
reporting on a topic or event.
•  Odd domain names generally equal 
odd and rarely truthful news.
•  Lack of author attribution may, 
but not always, signify that the 
news story is suspect and requires 
verification.
•  Check the “About Us” tab on 
websites or look up the website 
on Snopes or Wikipedia for more 
information about the source.
•  If the story makes you REALLY 
ANGRY it’s probably a good idea 
to keep reading about the topic via 
other sources to make sure the story 
you read wasn’t purposefully trying 
to make you angry (with potentially 
misleading or false information) in 
order to generate shares and ad 
revenue. 
•  It’s always best to read multiple 
sources of information to get a variety 
of viewpoints and media frames. 
Some sources not yet included in this 
list (although their practices at times 
may qualify them for addition), such 
as The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, 
and Fox News, vacillate between 
providing 
important, 
legitimate, 
problematic, and/or hyperbolic news 
coverage, requiring readers and 
viewers to verify and contextualise 
information with other sources.

Type-C is the way to go
USB 3.1 Type-C ports are still 
relatively new in the market but Acer 
ensures that it's the only way to go. 
Data transfer was surprisingly swift 
and efficient, making it that much 
easier to transfer data across.
Swift as a Coursing River
Acer Swift 7
Strength of a Raging Fire
Thin yet curvy, sleek yet stylish; the 
Acer Swift 7 is everything I've ever 
wanted and so much more. 
Its core is the 7th Gen. Intel 
Core i5 processor, which performs 
admirably when put through our 
benchmark tests as well as day-by-
day word processing, web browsing, 
video streaming and the sorts.
Mysterious as the Dark 
Side of the Moon 
Even if it isn't much of a mystery 
anymore, the 13.3 inch Full HD with 
IPS technology on the Swift 7 sure 
does know how to make everything 
look great. From older YouTube 
videos with 480p video quality to 
4K, the Swift 7 does its job with 
much ease. The display is also 
protected by the Corning Gorilla 
Glass, making it that much more 
durable especially in the hands of a 
klutz like me (fun fact: I'm actually a 
goalkeeper for my football team; oh 
All Around 
You
Thanks to Dolby 
Audio Premium 
paired with Acer 
TrueHarmony, you 
can now catch 
everything that 
you watch and 
listen to from your 
Hi-Res music to 
even the movies 
you watch in clear 
and crisp virtual 
surround sound.
Wider Than 
Usual
The touchpad 
on the Swift 7 is 
unusually wider 
than most laptops 
out there, giving 
you greater depth 
on its usability. 
Surprisingly, you 
do get a lot more 
done with a lot 
less swipes and 
movements now.
Force of a Great Typhoon 
Although not the best when it comes 
to data storage, the Swift 7 does 
hold its own relatively well with a 
256GB capacity on its SSD, which 
not only makes storage a lot easier 
but faster as well. Guess you could 
say it truly lives up to its namesake. 
The Swift 7 also comes with 8GB of 
RAM that allowed me to get through 
the day of binge-watching Netflix 
while still being able to get my work 
done simultaneously.

Keeping It Light & 
Tight
Much like the girl I'm sort of 
currently seeing, the Swift 7 is 
definitely more than just arm 
candy. Weighing in at only 
1.11kg (no she doesn't weigh 
that little) and only 0.39 
inches when closed (she's 
not that flat too), the Swift 
7 is perfect for the everyday 
on-the-go user who can work 
from just about anywhere 
and at any time. It's gold 
inner surface paired with an 
exterior matte black surface 
also strikes a fine balance 
between sexy and stunning.
Is it Worth It?
The Swift 7 faces pretty stiff competition from the likes of the HP Spectre 
and the ASUS Zenbook 3 in terms of its performance, design and general 
usability. Having tried and tested all three of these laptops in our lab, it's hard 
to determine which is the best among the three. Based on price alone, the 
Zenbook 3 wins hands down but in terms of performance, I would have to 
go with the Spectre. But, on a general day-to-day usage basis, the Swift 7 
captured my heart. 
Lasting a Lifetime
Yes, it is a bit of an 
exaggeration but in 
hindsight, a full 9 hours on 
a single charge is pretty 
impressive and that is what 
you can expect from the 
Swift 7.
Web Browsing Made Extremely Easy
UThanks to the 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi connection 
paired with MU-MIMO technology, the Swift 7 is can 
connect to the Internet easily and effortlessly with a 
much higher download rate than the regular 802.11n.

allows you to extend slightly

Fourth Generation 
Goodness
In the world of professional 
photography, the Canon EOS 5D 
series is regarded as the Porsche of 
cameras. Sleek looking on the outside, 
nice lines, premium finish and on the 
inside offer unparalleled performance 
when needed and all round quality in 
looks and function. 
So, when the new edition to the 
family made its debut late this year, 
the EOS 5D Mark IV is the fourth 
generation to this remarkable versatile 
range. Enthusiasts and professionals 
know they are in for a treat. Imagine 
the glee when we got the first review 
unit sent to our office, naturally we 
took it for a spin.
Double Take
Being in print, we take pride in our 
photography. Our arsenal of cameras 
include two units EOS 7D and a EOS 
5D Mark II (this old bird still amazes 
us, by the way), along with a string 
of mirrorless and point and shoots. 
Placing the new iteration next to its 
predecessors, you will not notice 
much difference in size, the weight 
however was reduced by 60g with the 
5D Mark IV now feeling much stable 
on our feeble hands at 800g (body 
only). Either a single handed or double 
handed grip, the contours on the body 
fits snuggly in the palm, even if you’re 
a female you will find hold firm.

A Modular Future Ahead
Motorola Moto Z
Hello Moto?
Motorola’s Android offerings used to 
be synonymous with bang-for-buck 
devices, offering a smooth Android 
experience without the exorbitant 
price tag. There was also the 
signature back dimple which housed 
the “M” - an intuitive place for users 
to place their index finger. With 
Lenovo now at the helm, and a new 
letter to denote a new tier, it seems 
Motorola is geared to play with the 
big boys.
Dimple Be Gone
The Moto Z stands out Moto’s 
previous offerings, eschewing the 
curved back for straight, slim profile. 
In place of the back dimple is the 
bane of modern smartphone design - 
the camera bump, and a pronounced 
one at that. That said, the Moto Z 
is remarkably comfortable to hold 
with one hand - it doesn’t dig into 
your fleshy palms, and the hardware 
buttons are easy to access… for 
right-handers (sorry southpaws!).
Fast and Furious
With some fast innards tucked within 
and just some light customisations 
applied to Android 6.0.1, it’s all 
smooth sailing with the Moto Z. The 
fingerprint reader unlocks the phone 
almost instantly, beating the current 
device I’m carrying. Throughout my 
days using it, I have never noticed any 
hints of slowdown, whether it’s playing 
a game of just checking my social 
feeds - the Moto Z is on point.
Moto Features
The unobtrusive and 
helpful Moto-exclusive 
features make a return 
in the Z, with Actions 
(gestures), Voice (voice 
commands) and Display 
(ambient display).
Multi-OS

OS you are using 
with the K780, the 
keys will evolve 
with your usage. 
Multiple keys have 
multiple functions 
for different OS.

Time to Mod
The Moto Z also introduces the Moto Mods and Moto’s proprietary pogo-
pin connection, with each Mod meant to enhance your experience with the 
Moto Z. Need a bigger battery? There’s a Mod for that. Need a projector? 
There’s one made by Lenovo. Need a souped-up camera with 10x 
optical zoom? Get the Hasselblad attachment. Finally, if you’re looking 
to shake the room, there’s the JBL SoundBoost Mod.
High Entry Point
My main issue with the Moto 
Mods is this: though they look and 
function the part, for the price they 
command, you could opt to invest in 
something non-proprietary - whether 
it be a power bank, a Bluetooth 
speaker, or a better camera. Buying 
into the Moto Z family means buying 
into an unproven ecosystem - one 
with potential, but you’ll need to get 
past the high entry price.

The Force is Strong 
in One
Powered by the Pascal GPU from 
NVIDIA, the MSI GT62 is the closest 
thing to a proper gaming setup, 
minus the large footprint. Although 
nothing compared to the GeForce 
GTX 1080, the 1070 within the GT62 
is a gem in its own way. Putting 
Overwatch, Dota 2 and even Skyrim 
to the test, it passed with flying 
colours with over 100 frames per 
second on all three games even on 
ultra settings.

Selfie Royalty
vivo v5
King of Selfies
If you are into selfies, the vivo v5 
may be your purchase of the year. 
Thanks to the 20-megapixel sensor 
on the front, it is a beast when 
compared to its peers (or even high 
tiered smartphones!). The soft light 
technology also ensures that the 
photos taken will look natural and 
not too overexposed, unlike other 
flash-solutions out there.
Single Button Operation
If you were wondering – yes, the vivo 
v5 doesn’t have any back button. The 
single fingerprint sensor cum home 
button is all you get with the phone. 
If you are used to the Android three-
button solution, it will be confusing. 
However, if you are coming from 
the iOS environment – it will be very 
familiar indeed.
Pretty Fly Design
Not only the phone is perfectly ok 
to use, it is also perfectly ok to be 
seen with. The design of the phone 
is reminiscent of a certain fruit 
company, but it makes it great to 
blend in with the crowd. The size of 
the phone is also now the norm of the 
industry, and it also makes it easier to 
game on the phone as well.
High 
Performance 
on Tap
4GB of RAM, plus 
32GB of storage, as 
well as the 8-core 
processor equals 
good performance 
on demand.
Selfie Like No 
Other
The Moonlight 
Selfie mode, plus 
the improved 
beauty mode in 
the camera app 
ensures perfect 
selfies every time.

High Fidelity Audio On The Rise
Philips Fidelio B8 Soundbar
True to Life Audio 
Technology 
Ever since professing my love for the 
Philips Fidelio X2 a couple of issues 
back, I had the opportunity to test 
out the Philips Fidelio B8 Soundbar, 
and it was glorious. Paired with the 
Dolby Atmost system, it gave the B8 
a truly breahtaking audio experience 
like no other. It made going to the 
cinema to catch a movie a thing of 
the past as now you can have the 
same experience in your own home. 
Speakers Everywhere 
The Fidelio B8 comes with 18 built-in 
speakers, all of which are upwards-
firing to provide a truly authentic 
experience with a dash of realism as 
if you were actually part of the car 
chase or shootout. At the the centre 
of the soundbar lies drivers that are 
solely dedicated on dialogue so you 
will be able to hear the villians evil 
plot perfectly clear while still having 
the movie's soundtrack playing in 
the background. 
Bass in Your Face  
To truly take the home cinematic 
experience to the next level, the B8 
comes with a dedicated subwoofer 
that has an 8-inch cone and a 220 
watt amplifier capable of delivering a 
cinematic bass response. You will not 
only be watching the movie but also 
feel as if you are a part of it, adding 
in a sense of realism and authenticity 
that cannot be found at your local 
cinema.

Bring on the Brown
Logitech G610 Orion Brown
Gaming Keyboard
Brown is Best 
Known as the best “middle-ground” 
switch in the Cherry MX switches 
line, the brown cherry keys on the 
Logitech G610 is one of the best 
keyboards I have used thus far 
(Corsair is far out of my budget). 
Its tactile bump feedback is great 
for your fingers while providing 
that audible 'click' every time you 
type. Each mechanical switch also 
comes with a lifespan of 50 million 
keystrokes so you won't have to 
worry about getting a new keyboard 
anytime soon.
Bright & Tight Lights 
Much like any other gaming 
keyboard these days, the G610 
comes with RGB backlit keys 
with the option of being totally 
customisable to suit your game style 
or preference when using for work. 
You can personalise each and every 
key light from a spectrum of 16.8 
million colours - I can only recognise 
16 colours at most - and even 
synchronise your lighting effects 
with other Logitech gaming gear. 
Now, you can keep track of specific 
spells and other commands by 
placing a specific colour over it. 
Keeping it Clean 
If you're anything like me (I sure 
hope to God you're not!), you 
would hate the constant fingerprint 
smudging on the keyboard. The 
material used for the keys is a 
fingerprint-masking matte surface, 
allowing you to stare at the keyboard 
with awe and glee without cringing 
at every smudge you see. It also 
doesn't have that plastic feel when 
you're typing, providing your fingers 
with comfort when you're constantly 
jamming away at it. 
Three-Step Setup 
Most keyboards only have two 
modes - either it lays flat down or 
its tiled at eight degrees.

an LED off button to turn

Above Average at Best
Oppo F1s
Need More Sweets! 
Although the Oppo F1s is still 
stuck on the backdated Android 
5.1 Lollipop OS, Oppo's very own 
ColorOS 3.0 is a great OS to 
complement the Lollipop with 
very minimal bloatware while still 
remaining Android's core features. 
One thing I loved about the F1s was 
its long-lasting battery which can 
last up to three days if you're on Low 
Power mode. If not, it can last up 
between 10 to 13 hours on average.
Same Same, but Different 
At first glance, you wouldn’t be able 
to tell the F1s and the F1 apart due 
to them being eerily similar from the 
front. What I enjoyed most about the 
F1s was the slim bezel, allowing more 
room for the 5.5-inch IPS LCD screen. 
The F1s also gets the bio-metric 
fingerprint scanner treatment, much 
to the dismay of F1 users. Overall, 
the F1s is a great device to have in 
your hands without slipping off your 
fingers thanks to its fit-to-palm figure
Selfies All Day Err'day 
The front-facing camera on the 
F1s comes with 16 megapixels, f2.0 
aperture lens and tones of pre-
installed features and filters for the 
everyday selfie taker to go crazy. 
Dual-SIM 
Support 
Much like most 
smartphones 
these days, the F1s 
can support two 
Nano SIM cards 
simultaneously 
while also holding 
a microSD card.
Subpar 
Night-time 
Shots 
Taking pictures 
during the night 
turned out to be 
really grainy and 
with plenty of 
noise.
Good Display of Colour 
The representation of colour from the F1s primary 
camera is pretty decent while still remaining 
pretty clear and pleasing to the eye.

A Mini Monster
Marshall Kilburn
Monster in Disguise 
The roaring sound emitting from 
such a small stereo speaker will 
definitely make heads turn. It’s 
like the little brother for Marshall 
Stanmore but don’t let its size fool 
you. This little Marshall Kilburn is not 
one to back down from a sound off. 
Perhaps, it is one of the best small 
sized stereo speakers in the market 
right now. Not to mention with the 
weight of only 3kg, this little menace 
will rock your eardrums for sure!
Rockin’ Out on the Go
The Kilburn comes with a built-in 
battery that lasts for the better part 
of the day – a true indul-gence for 
audiophiles who are always on the go. 
It is Bluetooth compatible, so you can 
just connect to it wirelessly regardless 
of where you are. It is also a plus point 
for those who hates wires like me.  
(Kil)burn em’ All
Like the other speakers in its range, 
Marshall is not shy to show off the 
beautiful audio it emits…and it is no 
different with the Kilburn despite is 
tiny disposition. The clarity and the 
mids are almost perfect – a contender 
that surely be the last one standing in 
a ring against all other speakers of its 
size. It’s an amazing feat for Marshall to 
provide users with massive quality in 
such a small package. Say goodbye to 
distortions because the Kilburn really 
amazes me when I pumped it up all 
the way. As a heavy music enthusiast, 
this little monster will make your head 
banging for more! 
Enhanced 
Connectivity
It can be connected 
through Bluetooth. It 
also has an earphone 
jack to connect to 
your mobile for better 
streaming experience.
Fine Tuning 
Made Easy
The analogue knobs 
allow you to adjust 
the volume, bass 
and treble to suit 
your personal music 
preference. 
Vintage 
Satisfaction
Its classic finish 
together with that 
signature chrome 
logo and that leather 
strap makes the

OKI MC573dn 
Value for Money
If you thought having a multifunction 
printer (MFP) that produces quality 
coloured and mono printouts would 
mean spending a large sum of money, 
this is where the OKI MC573dn 
will prove you wrong. The perfect 
complement for any small to medium 
businesses (SMBs), or even small office, 
home office (SOHO), the MC573dn is 
an affordable choice. 
Takes a Little Bit of Time
I did however notice that the 
warming up and receiving data 
time between colour and mono 
differs greatly. While it can take 
up to 10 seconds for mono, my 10 
colour photo printouts took about 
35 seconds of wait time before it 
started printing. That said, it still is 
impressively quick after the brief 
period of waiting – good things 
come to those who wait, right?  
Quick on its Feet
The printouts produced by the 
MC573dn is stunning, and best of all, 
it is efficient than most printers we’ve 
had in our test labs. Even against our 
daily print churner ES9455 MFP, the 
MC573dn is quick on its feet – from 
first print out time to print per minute 
(ppm). On paper, OKI says the printer 
can produce up to 30ppm for both 
colour and mono. In our tests, the 
ppm doesn’t vary much from colour 
to mono, clocking in at 25ppm and 
27ppm respectively. 
Up to A4
The printer only 
supports up to A4 
material size only; it 
does smaller paper 
sizes well too.
Optional 
Upgrades
There are a few 
optional upgrades 
you can consider. 
Aside from extra 
paper trays, you 
can install a ‘Card 
Release’ scanner 
if you require an 
encrypted private 
printing option.

Sony MDR 1000X Headphones
Exceptionally Comfortable 
For anyone who knows me well 
enough, I despise headphones 
because it ruins the volume in my 
hair (I'm vain, so sue me). However, 
the Sony MDR 1000X headphones 
is one of the few exceptions to 
make the cut because of its soft 
synthetic leather padding that 
makes it extremely comfortable to 
wear, even during long hours. The 
padding around the headband was 
just as comfortable; for the first 
time, I didn't care about how my hair 
looked like.
Immersive Yet Observant 
Most of the time when people wear 
headphones, they wouldn't be able 
to hear everything else around them, 
especially if their music volumes 
are turned up. The MDR 1000X 
now allows you to have your music 
playing clearly while still being 
aware of your surroundings. From 
catching important messages and 
announcements to listening to the 
traffic and the people around you, the 
MDR 1000X promises an experience 
like no other. 
Great Built-in Features  
The interactive gesture panel 
located on the right earcup is a great 
breakthrough from Sony. You can now 
have your money turned up at full 
volume and still be able to be part of 
the conversation; simply cover your 
palm over the earcup. You can also 
swipe and tap on the earcup to play/
pause music, skip through tracks, 
change the volume and even activate 
your smartphone's voice assistant 
features. 
Hi-Res and

you can now upscale all 
your compressed digital 
music files to the closest 
form of Hi-Res quality

From Another Planet 
Alienware has come up with a new 
way to entice gamers and they 
have struck the perfect cord with 
the Alienware 15. its sleek and slim 
design paired with an all-black

the monitor just exudes exclusitivity

pizzazz.
Keeping with the Times 
Much like the gamig laptops of

experience like no other. Although it 
may not be the 1080, the 1070 GPU 
holds itself pretty well on its own

Sharp Z2
Good in the Hands
The design of the Sharp Z2 is great 
that it felt comfortable in the hands. 
The slight curve on the back gives it 
great handhold, and the fingerprint

hand – so this is great for lefties or 
righties. It supports DualSIM slots, and 
it is also capable to accept a MicroSD 
card, but you lose your second SIM if 
you use that.

are also a big part of the company’s 
repertoire, in both display and 
smartphones themselves. Commtiva 
is Sharp’s licensee here in South 
East Asia, and they will be your 
go-to guys when you want a Sharp 
smartphone from now. 
Power in Your Pocket
The ten core processor in the Z2 
gives it enough juice and ‘oomph’ to 
run just about any apps you have in 
mind – from basic day-to-day apps all 
the way to extensive and demanding 
3D games that will look great on the 
large 5.5-inch screen. The Helio X20 
is no slouch when compared to some 
of its processor peers in the market 
that’s for sure. 
Chunky but 
Good
It is not the 
thinnest 
phone in the 
market. That 
said, you will 
have the most 
confidence in 
using it daily.
Power Hit 
It has a 3,000mAh 
battery, but in our 
tests, it runs out 
fairly quickly – most 
likely due to beefy 
processor.
Futureproof 
The use of USB 
Type-C means 
that it will be 
ready for the next 
generation of 
technology.

Samsung Slams it Home
 Samsung HWK950 Soundbar & UBD-K8500 
4K Ultra Blu-ray Player
The Perfect Home 
Accessories  
despite being hit by a rough patch 
over the past few months, nobody 
does household electronics quite like 
Samsung. The HW-K950 Soundbar 
provides the ultimate in 4K audio 
experience like no other. Paired with 
the UBD-K8500 4K Blu-ray player, 
you can now have 4K enhancement 
in both picture and sound, another 
reason to never leaving your house 
again. Just be sure to have a 
compatible Ultra 4K TV on hand.
Elevate Your Living Space 
Samsung added its Surround Sound 
Expansion Plus technology into 
the HW-K950, which will add a 
vertical dimension to just about any 
soundtrack or movie you're listening 
to. The soundbar also comes with 
upward-firing drivers in its main and 
rear speakers, which is great when 
paired with the UBD-K8500 as it 
comes with HDR technology. You 
can now have the best picture paired 
with the best sound money can buy 
for an unforgettable experience.
Dolby Atmos-enabled  
If you're wondering why it sounds 
like the HW-K950 Soundbar seems 
to good to be true, it's all due to 
the Dolby Atmos technology that 
has been applied into the soundbar. 
From the rush of waterfalls to even a 
plane taking off right above you, you 
can hear and experience everything 
thanks to the overhead effects 
produced by the speakers. 
Keep It Clean 
and Tight 
The HW-K950 can be 
connected wirelessly 
so you will not need 
to connect the main 
soundbar to the 
subwoofer or even the 
rear speakers through 
cables.
4K Streaming 
Made Easy 
You can now stream 
the latest 4K shows 
straight to your 
living room via the 
UBD-K8500 so you 
don't have to go HD 
videos from YouTube 
and Netflix.
Play Anything & Everything 
From CD's to Ultra Blu-ray discs and even 
3D Blu-ray discs, the UBD-K8500 can 
accommodate any and all sorts of CD's to 
play.

A Better iPad Mini
Huawei Mediapad M3
A Multimedia Tablet 
The Huawei Mediapad M3 comes 
with the Huawei Kirin 950 processor, 
giving it more than enough juice to 
power through any apps that you 
can think of. The high-resolution 
screen means that your content will 
look tack sharp, and impressive in 
any condition. It also has enough 
storage space on board for the 
multimedia files, but if more storage 
is needed – the microSD slot will 
come in handy.
Great Sound Stage  
Audio will not be a problem with the 
Huawei Mediapad M3. It has Harman 
Kardon stereo speakers built-in, so 
it can reproduce good sound as and 
when needed. Not only that, the 
audio quality is great even at high 
volumes, as the sound processing 
done on the tablet is on par with 
professional devices out there. 
Our only comment is that Huawei 
should have made the speakers face 
forward. 
A Tablet In A 
Smartphone World 
The functionalities of the Huawei 
Mediapad M3 is impressive, more 
so in a package that it comes with. 
The large screen, small bezel and 
high resolution display means this is 
a good tablet to tote around. It also 
has full 4G connectivity, so you can 
make your calls, transfer data and 
do anything you would do on your 
smartphone with the tablet – without 
looking like you are putting a book to 
your ear.

the Mediapad

Seriously, Sony?
Sony Xperia X Compact
Is This A Smartphone 
For Ants?! 
I've never been a fan of smartphones 
with a relatively miniscule display 
screen. The 4.2-inch on the Xperia X 
Compact looks like a device meant 
for children due to its small frame 
and size. Granted, I do have huge 
fingers – or fat, whichever works 
– so it's a real challenge for me to 
actually operate the phone on a daily 
basis.
It Definitely Can't Swim 
Another feature that Sony left out 
of the Xperia X Compact was its 
waterproof capabilities that have 
been around since the Z Series era. 
One of the main reasons I was a 
proud owner of a Z3 was partially 
due to its waterproof feature. 
However, Sony have gone backwards 
with the Xperia X Compact and 
instead replaces it with a design 
that's great for single-hand usage (if 
you're not a giant that is).
Surprisingly Disappointing  
Although running on a Snapdragon 
650, the Xperia X Compact doesn't 
do much to boost my expectations 
of this smartphone with it actually 
falling behind on performance when 
running power-hungry applications 
like Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube 
and Spotify. Compared to my Z3, 
the Xperia X Compact is miles away 
from it, even though it is the newer 
smartphone of the two. 
Cheaply 
Designed 
Not only is the 
Xperia X Compact 
made out of plastic 
materials, its boxy 
and overly-squared 
design just doesn't 
do this device any 
justice whatsoever.
High-end 
Letdown 
At 23 megapixels and 
f/2.0 aperture but 
its performance is 
mediocre at best.
Saving Grace 
The 2,700mAh 
battery capacity on 
this device performs 
admirably, one of the 
very few standout 
points with up to 13 – 
16 hours on average.
VERDICT: 
“Overpriced, Underperforming and just downright disappointing, the Xperia X Compact 
has seriously dropped the standard Sony has set for themselves. ” - Wi-Liam

The P Stands For Perfection
Huawei P9 Plus
Designed to Perfection 
I like my smartphone like how I like 
my women – curvy, elegant and 
with a certain edge to them that 
sweeps me off my feet every time I 
have them in my hands. In terms of 
design, the Huawei P9 Plus comes 
with a full aluminium body while 
still remaining lightweight and easy 
on the fingers. The placement of 
the fingerprint scanner is also ideal 
as its located at the rear instead of 
following the norm and having it at 
the front of the device.
Keeping it Juiced   
Unlike most smartphones in the 
market, the P9 Plus comes with a 
Type-C 1.0 reversible connector. 
You’ll never have to worry about 
putting the charging port from the 
wrong side. The P9 Plus also comes 
with a Quick Charging battery so you 
can do more with the device without 
having to plug it in all day long. It 
can also last a considerable amount 
of hours – my record is 20 hours
Leica Glove
The P9 Plus comes with dual-rear 
cameras, one of which is the Leica 
monochrome lens, allowing you 
to capture exquisite B&W images 
without even needing a filter. It allows 
more light into the picture, making 
it look as authentic as humanly 
possible. 
Comes with 
Casing 
Huawei has 
included a basic 
clear casing in 
the box.

Messenger of the Gods
Gamdias Hermes RGB Gaming Keyboard
Loud and Clear 
Instead of relying on the usual 
Cherry MX switches (which I would 
have preferred), Gamdias actually 
took a different route with the 
Hermes RGB and installed its very 
own Gamdias Certified Mechanical 
Switches. Surprisingly powerful and 
with 50 million clicks lifespan, these 
blue switches provide that audible 
click and comfortable feel, much like 
Cherry MX. The Gamdias Hermes 
RGB is one of the few brands I enjoy 
out of the usual suspects.
Record and Play Instantly 
The Hermes RGB allows you to 
record and execute your recorded 
macro keys, making it that much 
easier to game on-the-fly. This is 
essentially useful for MMO players 
and the such who need to have a 
preferred set of keys. However, to 
record your macro keys, you would 
need to download Gamdias' own 
software – Hera from the website to 
have full function over the keyboard.
Built-in Media Keys 
Function key F2 to F8 supports 
media keys that allow you to skip 
through tracks, play/pause, mute and 
change the volume. F4 in particular 
allows you to swap out the directional 
keys with 'WASD' keys, which is 
useful for FPS games like Overwatch 
and Counter Strike. 
Colours of the Wind 
With 16.8 million colour backlighting, the 
Hermes RGB will be able to illuminate in a sea 
of spectrum, much like many other gaming 
keyboards.
Store Your Keys 
Thanks to the built-in 32-bit ARM Cortex 
TM-M3 microprosessor, you can store up 
to six different macro key

Enroute to Connectivity 
TP-Link AC3200 Wireless Tri-Band 
Gigabit Router
Keeping Up with the Trend
The advent of ‘spider-legs’ antennas 
on routers seems to be upon us, 
following ASUS’ reveal of its eight-
legged AC5300 router. Not one to 
be left behind in terms of design 
innovation, TP-Link released the 
AC3200 Wireless Tri-Band Gigabit 
Router, albeit with two antennas less. 
It is by no means a slouch when it 
comes to performance as it boasts 
of impressive speed and coverage. 
It also promises less network 
congestion, a problem that many 
small office, home office (SOHO) 
businesses face. 
Unconventional Yet 
Functional 
The design of the AC3200 reminds 
you of a flattened black box when its 
antennas are neatly tucked in their 
respective gutters. Extend the six 
antennas outwards and what you’ll 
see is a device that was perhaps 
perceived as futuristic by TP-Link. 
Its square-shaped nature may be a 
far cry from conventional routers in 
the market; this makes it all the more 
memorable in our books. Setting 
up was fairly easy, if - yes, there is 
a huge if here – you read the setup 
guide properly. For beginners, it may 
be a little bit of an adventure, but 
you’ll get there…eventually.
Short Distance Only
The AC3200 is a perfect networking 
solution for SOHO has its 2.4GHz 
band performs well in smaller 
environments. Its throughput on this 
particular band remained steady 
at 29Mb/s if you’re no more than 
five meters away from the router. 
However, it does falter when you’re 
further away, which makes us think it 
won’t be suitable for an office of 16 
people (with your boss sitting all the 
way in front).  
Compact and 
Portable
With ‘3D Axis’ 
hinges, the N60 
can be folded 
flat and stored 
away in the 
included soft case.

nline shopping are slowly taking over shopping malls and with great reason. Feeding 
off basic human instinct where laziness is a factor, online shopping has made it easy 
for consumers to shop through their smartphone or laptop without having to even 
leave the comfort of their own home. This month for our showdown, we take a look at the 
top online sites in Malaysia, mainly Lazada, 11street, Vmall, SenQ and Harvey Norman, plus 
its offerings to the consumers.

Lazada
ince its inception in March 2012, Lazada has grown to become arguably 
the biggest e-commerce online website in Southeast Asia, located 
in countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, 
Indonesia and Vietnam. Founded by Rocket Internet back in 2011, Lazada 
is now at the forefront when it comes to e-commerce websites, attracting the 
attention of e-commerce Giants, Alibaba Group who is now the majority owner.
S
Layout
Having previously worked at Lazada as part of the Production department and in 
charge of the content that goes up on the website, I am thoroughly impressed 
with how the layout of the homepage has grown over the past few years. The 
only thing I’m disappointed by is the content of the products Lazada is offering 
as that has not changed, even after my absence. However, I digress; the home 
page is clean and easy-to-use, allowing you to easily navigate between the many 
categories of products you would like to shop for, making it that much easier for 
you to actually find what you are looking for.
Offerings
When it comes to what Lazada has to offer to the consumers, you will be 
spoiled for choice. Divided into 14 different categories, Lazada offers products 
ranging from fashion to electronics and even home appliances, travel & luggage, 
automotive & media to even home & living. Once you’ve decided which category 
you would like to shop browse through, Lazada allows you to choose between 
different sub-categories so you can find exactly what you’re looking for without 
having to skim through everything offered in a single category.
User Experience
In terms of user experience, Lazada makes it very easy for a user to navigate the 
website with plenty of ways one can shop with ease. From being able to have a 
cash-on-delivery (COD) option to paying online through various online banking 
services, Lazada has covered all the grounds for an easy and effortless experience 
when it comes to online shopping. You can also change the language used on the 
website, depending on which you are more comfortable with. One great feature 
on Lazada is the option of being able to log-in without having to create an account 
with them, simply sign in via Facebook or Google+ and that’s it. If you’re a third-
party reseller, you can also sell your products through Lazada via its Marketplace 
instead of having to sell through other avenues. Lazada also allows shoppers to 
track their products through the website, making it that much easier for you to 
know the exact whereabouts of your purchases.
Promotions
One of the reasons Lazada always stood out from the crowd if for its promotions, 
and it has many throughout the year. The biggest sale for Lazada comes from its 
11/11 and 12/12 sales, known as ‘Online Revolution’. Aside from that, Lazada 
also has sales for any special and/or festive occasion. Whether it’s the start of a 
new school year, Chinese New year, Father’s Day or even World Pet Day, there is 
always a sale happening on Lazada where consumers can get the best deals on 
items they’re looking for.

11street
stablished in March 2014, 11street was orignally a leading e-commerce 
company based in South Korea but has since expanded its operations to 
Malaysia as well. Co-owned by both Celcom Axiata Berhad of Malaysia 
and SK Planet of South Korea, 11street has a huge Korean influence on 
its site, which fits well into the modern youth of Malaysia, who also happen to 
be huge fans of the Korean pop culture that is ever popular the world over the 
past few years.
E
Layout
Unlike Lazada, 11street’s homepage layout isn’t as organised or as categorised. 
Surfing through it’s homepage, you would find an assortment of products from 
various categories ranging from fashion, electronics and even groceries on it. 
Although looking much like a hurricane just went through its homepage. 11street 
is great for online shoppers who are looking to shop for a particular product 
without the need to browse through the entire selection it has to offer (much like 
what I do, so kudos to you 11street).
Offerings
Like what Lazada has to offer, 11street has plenty of categories for consumers 
to choose from like fashion, electronics, groceries and even e-vouchers and 
travel tickets. This is great for families and couples as you can choose from a 
wide selection of tickets that range from theme parks to museums, botanical 
gardens and even vacations in and out of Malaysia. You can also buy vouchers to 
restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, beauty centres and many more.
User Experience
When testing out the checkout feature on 11street’s website, I encountered 
a problem that didn’t allow me to connect my Facebook page to the site, thus 
making me waste my precious minutes in creating a new account from scratch 
instead. The one thing I hate about creating new accounts is the password where 
all sorts of obscure rules are thrown into it, much to my dismay. After crossing 
that hurdle, you will be given the choice of making payment via online banking, 
credit/debit card, ATM/bank transfer or even AirCash, which will redirect you to 
iPay88’s verification page. Like Lazada, you can also be a seller on 11street.
Promotions
11street also focuses on festive periods as well as holidays and important dates 
around Malaysia for its promotions and sales to occur like Christmas, Chinese 
New Year, Hari Raya and many other occassions. Other important dates like 
Father’s Day or Mother’s Day is also a point of focus as these sales are the driving 
force behind the modern day e-commerce site.

Vmall
ocused solely on the distribution of Huawei devices, Vmall’s main business 
model allows consumers to purchase Huawei and Honor smartphones as 
well as accessories for those who couldn’t be bothered to lineup and 
wait. Although it’s a more niche market as compared to what Lazada and 
11street are doing, this plays out well for Vmall as its target audience are mainly 
consumers who are fans and potential customers.
F
Layout
Taking a page out of the Huawei and Honor smartphone design, Vmall’s homepage 
layout is clean, simple and very easy to use. Its sleek cream white background 
gives a soothing appeal to customers who are only looking to purchase a Huawei 
or Honor device or accessory, making the transition from the homepage to the 
product page easy and seamless.
Offerings
As mentioned, Vmall doesn’t have much in terms of offerings seeing as it only 
offers Huawei and Honor devices. Aside from smartphones, Vmall also holds 
Huawei MediaPads as well as the Huawei Matebook alongside wearables like 
the Huawei Watch for men and women, the Huawei TalkBand as well as the 
Honor Band. Accessories are also available on Vmall from screen protectors to 
casings and even powerbanks. One interesting product featured on Vmall’s site 
is Huawei’s very own Mobile Broadband router so you can have Wi-Fi wherever 
you go.
User Experience
With only four sections to choose from (Honor 8, Honor, Huawei and Shop All) It’s 
very easy to navigate through Vmall’s site. Once deciding on which device you 
want, you can also choose to purchase tablets, wearables and accessories all in 
the same place. Vmall also promises 100% free delivery with every order over 
RM100 spent on a single receipt, 15 days replacement service, a 100% secure 
payment gateway and even 100% manufacturing warranty. In that sense, Vmall 
has covered all the basis of a typical consumer’s queries. Once deciding on the 
product, you will be taken to the product page with a full description about the 
product to give you a general idea of what it can do along with a gallery to view 
it from different angles, specifications to see what keeps the device running and 
of course, reviews. Vmall doesn’t allow you to create an account via Facebook so 
you will have to create an account with them.
Promotions
Seeing as Vmall sells only Huawei and Honor devices exclusively, I can imagine 
promotions are very hard to come by unless it’s before the release of a new 
product. Judging from previous promotions, Vmall held two promotions over the 
past few months in conjunction with the Honor 8 smartphone.

SenQ
aving been a part of Malaysia for as long as I can remember, SenQ is 
one of the few cosumer electronic giants where you can find just about 
anything in its store. Located all around the Klang Valley, SenQ has built 
its name up to be one of the first places people will check out when 
they are interested in purchasing anything electronic. Recently, SenQ has also 
come up with its own website where you can do all your shopping right on your 
smartphone or laptop.

As soon as you check out SenQ’s homepage, you will be greeted by SenQ’s latest 
online promotions, which I will talk about in a bit. SenQ’s website is clean and 
pretty much straightforward as there aren’t many widgets and buttons located 
around its website, making it very easy to navigate. Located right at the top is the 
search bar with a darker outline to make it even easier for you to locate the exact 
product you’re looking for.
Offerings
With SenQ’s main target being consumer elctronics, that is all you’ll be able to 
shop for on its online site. That may not sound like a lot but SenQ does offer a 
wide variety of products for you to choose from. From digital appliances to kitchen 
appliances, gadgets, TV’s and audio to even personal and beauty care, SenQ is 
capable of furnishing all the elctronics in your household through a click of a 
button.

Thanks to the clean and straightforward layout of SenQ’s website, it is 
extremely easy to navigate through the site to find exactly what you’re looking 
for. As mentioned earlier, the search bar at the top of the homepage is already 
highlighted for you so instead of having to sift through all the products, you can 
just type down what exactly you’re looking for.
Promotions
One great promotion from SenQ is its member’s price where if you’re a SenQ 
memership holder, you’re eligible to a discounted price on selected products. 
Sadly, products that are still considered new into the market does not come 
with a reduced price. Aside from that, SenQ also has a special section on online 
promotions where you can get great deals on selected products that are currently 
on demand.

Harvey Norman
ince 1982, the Australian-based multi-national retailer known as Harvey 
Norman has been a staple name when it comes to furniture as well 
as consumer electronics and household appliances. With over 280 
company-owned stores located in Australia and the rest of the world, 
Harvey Norman is definitely one of the places you will visit when it comes to 
furnishing your home.
S
Layout
The homepage of the Malaysian website for Harvey Norman displays its featured 
products list, which there are many to choose from. Following similarly to what 
SenQ did with its website, Harvey Norman is very clean and straightforward, 
making it very easy to navigate without much confusion. 
Offerings
Located at the very bottom of the homepage, you can see the wide variety of 
brands that are deemed trusted by Harvey Norman themselves so you need not 
worry if what you’re buying is real or fake. Although the website mostly focuses 
on consumer electronics, gadgets and household appliances, you will also be able 
to purchase furnitures as well as beddings.
User Experience
Unlike Lazada and 11street, Harvey Norman’s homepage allows you to add the 
products instantly to cart without having to be redirected to the product page. 
This makes it much easier for online shoppers who just want to get it over and 
done with in a matter of minutes and not be distracted to buy anything else 
(basically shoppers like me). At the top of the homepage, you can choose to look 
at catalogues and even locate a Harvey Norman near you.
Promotions
Aside from having the usual festive promotions, Harvey Norman has an entire 
section dedicated to its promotions, which can be found on the homepage. As 
part of the promotion, customers can also get RM20 online credit to shop with 
Harvey Norman by signing up to their newsletter, thus notifying them on new and 
incoming promotions.

COMPARISON
CONCLUSION
After careful consideration and actually visiting all five websites, I would have to choose Lazada as the winner, mainly because of how long it has been in the 
e-commerce scene and making themselves known around Southeast Asia. Although, 11street does deserve a special mention as I can see them giving Lazada a run for its 
money as there are certain items that 11street carries while Lazada does not on their website

Photo effects of wide angle lenses
Ultra-wide angle lenses are considered one of the most difficult interchangeable lenses to master. While such lenses can capture a wider view than standard 
lenses, they have the rather unique characteristic of causing perspective distortion by exaggerating perspectives. In Part 1 of this series, I will explain the 
characteristics of ultra-wide angle lenses and how you can make use of them.

What is a wide-angle lens?
A common gripe photographers often have is the 
difficulty of using wide-angle lenses. Wide angle 
lenses generally have an (full frame) equivalent 
focal length in the region of 35mm or less. Wide 
angle lenses with an equivalent focal length 
of 24mm or less are sometimes called ultra-
wide angle lenses. On APS-C DSLRs, lenses 
with a focal length of around 24mm or less are 
considered wide-angle, and those at 16mm or 
less are ultra-wide angle. 
For people who regard wide-angle as difficult, 
you often hear them saying that the difficulty lies 
in composition due to a large number of objects 
being included in the field of view. However, I think 
that this is probably because they have equated 
a wide-angle lens to a lens that captures a wide 
view. However, that is but one aspect of wide-angle 
lenses.
Another characteristic of wide-angle lenses 
is its unique perspective distortion effect, where 
relative sizes and distances between objects and 
the camera are exaggerated, causing nearby objects 
to look much nearer and bigger and faraway objects 
to appear even smaller and further away. Once you 
are able to master this characteristic of perspective 
exaggeration, you will probably be struck by how 
appealing wide-angle lenses are.
For wide-angle lenses, all lines will 
converge somewhere
To better understand perspective exaggeration, 
you will need to learn about visual perspective. 
However, when using a wide-angle lens to take 
photos, you need not understand the lens in 
detail straight from the get-go. Rather, the first 
thing you should be aware of is where the lines 
in the photo converge. 
For example, in the photo on the right, I tried 
capturing a shot of a simple hallway with an ultra-
wide angle lens (FL: 16mm). You can see that the 
lines converge in a way that makes the end of the 
hallway vanish into the centre.
While this kind of convergence can be seen 
even with standard, non-wide-angle lenses - the 
wider the angle, the more striking the convergence 
effect is mastering this convergence effect is the 
first step to mastering wide angle lenses.
Two rules for getting comfortable 
with the characteristics of wide-
angle lenses
So, where on earth do the lines converge when 
using a wide-angle lens? This point of convergence 
is sometimes termed the “vanishing point”. This 
is apparent in the photo of the hallway, where the 
lines converge into a single point in the centre. 
However, a convergence point (or vanishing 
point) is not limited to the centre. It could also be 
on the left or right side of the photo, or even outside 
EOS 5D Mark III/ EF16-35mm f/2.8L USM/ f13/ 1/80/ ISO 640
of the photo. Even so, there is no need to think of 
it as something complicated. The following two 
guidelines are all you need to consider when you 
start out taking shots:
1. Lines of the subject converge from the edges of 
the image towards each other. 
2. Convergence makes objects on the edges of the image 
appear larger, while objects in the centre appear smaller.
Let’s look at specific examples of each to 
understand the characteristics of wide angle.

Get a feel for the characteristics of 
wide angle
Even if you don’t have an ultra-wide angle lens on 
hand, the wide-angle end of a standard zoom lens is 
sufficient to let you get a feel for the characteristics 
of wide angle. The wide-angle end of a standard 
zoom lens is generally 24 to 28mm equivalent, 
which is more than enough wide-angle to have 
some fun with at first. 
Of course, the perspective distortion effects at 
24mm and in the ultra-wide angle range of 16mm 
is completely different. To benefit even more from 
the characteristics of wide-angle, I would suggest 
getting an ultra-wide angle lens going forward.
1. Lines of the subject converge 
from the edges of the image 
towards each other
This is the most important point to keep in mind. 
When you use a wide-angle lens, the lines of 
the subject converge from the edge of the image 
towards each other. Convergence occurs even with 
standard lenses, but to a lesser degree.
A subject that appears from the bottom of the 
image converges upward. If appearing from the left, 
convergence occurs toward the right, and likewise 
for subjects that appear from one of the corners.
Using the photo below as an example, the tower 
“springs” up from the bottom, so it converges upward. 
Some of you might be thinking, “That’s obvious!”, 
but this isn’t something we usually think about when 
looking through the viewfinder. Rather than simply 
observing that the subject converges when you look at 
it through the viewfinder, wouldn’t it be better if you 
thought about how positioning the subject a certain 
way would make it converge correspondingly?
Next, the train in the photo on the bottom right 
appears from the left side of the image, so the lines 
converge toward the right.

f/5.6/ 1/320/ ISO 3200 
A: Top and bottom corners of the image (on the near end)
If you shoot while thinking about the composition, you should 
keep in mind that the lines of objects appearing from the 
corners of an image converge towards each other.

2. Convergence makes objects 
on the edges of the image appear 
larger, while objects in the middle 
appear smaller
I think most people experience the first guideline 
without being aware of it, but how about this 
next one? When using a wide-angle lens, objects 
on the edge of the image appear larger due to 
perspective exaggeration, while objects in the 
centre are not as affected.
For example, here is a photo taken among high-
rise buildings in Manhattan. Because I took this 
shot looking up from nearby, the buildings appear 
from the bottom of the image. Therefore, looking 
from bottom to top gives a strong perspective 
exaggeration effect. This is definitely a photo that 
screams “wide-angle!”.
In contrast, the next photo is of Manhattan 
taken from a distance over the water. Even though 
they are the same buildings, the perspective 
exaggeration effect is not as strong because they 
are near the centre of the image. 
Lenses to consider
The lens that I usually use is the EF16-35mm 
f/2.8L II USM. I really love this lens due to the 
beautiful beams of light that appear from the sun 
or street lights of a nightscape when I narrow 
the aperture. Because this lens is bright even at 
maximum aperture, it can also be used for taking 
shots of stars.
EOS 5D Mark III/ EF16-
35mm f/2.8L USM/ f/16/ 
1/125/ ISO 500
However, if you look more closely, the sea and sky 
in the foreground are in the top and bottom edges of 
the image, and the perspective exaggeration effect 
is rather strong for them. 
From the point of view of someone with a 
thorough knowledge of visual perspective, this 
can seem like a guideline that is full of exceptions. 
However, if you are able to compose your shots with 
an understanding of these two guidelines for the 
time being, you should have nothing to fear about 
the characteristics of wide-angle lenses. 
Look out for Part 2 next month, where studio9 
talks about composition techniques for wide-
angle lenses.
If you are using an APS-C camera, I would 
recommend choosing an EF-S lens. The actual angle 
of view of APS-C cameras is equivalent to 1.6 times 
the angle of view of the focal length described 
on the lens. So, for a wide-angle end with a focal 
length of 10mm, the actual angle of view will be 
equivalent to 16mm.

Web 
Services 
(AWS) came about to serve 
parent company Amazon 
in fulfilling and processing 
the millions of transactions daily. It 
started in 2006 where AWS began 
offering IT infrastructure services 
to businesses in the form of web 
services, which is now commonly 
known as cloud computing. 
With cost of infrastructure and 
hardware, as well as the need 
to upgrade them regularly was 
becoming bane for organisations, 
many Chief Technology Officers 
turned to the cloud for solutions. 
With the cloud, businesses no longer 
need to plan for and procure servers 
and other IT infrastructure weeks 
or months in advance. Instead, they 
can instantly spin up hundreds or 
thousands of servers in minutes and 
are able to deliver results faster.
At the recent annual gathering 
of 
developers, 
partners 
and 
clients in Las Vegas, the 5th AWS 
re:Invent 2016 demonstrated that 
the interest in cloud computing is 
still relevant as ever. Boasting of 
a turnout exceeding over 32,000 
(compared to just 4,000 during its 
inaugural event), the conference’s 
popularity is a testament to its 
AWS re:Invent 2016 
Commoditising Cloud Computing 
A
services’ agility and versatility 
compared to other providers. 
Now, the company has over 
two million active customers every 
month and generating US$13 billion 
in revenue. Interestingly, AWS has 
also reduced its price 58 times since  
it first launched. The factor that has 
customers move over to this platform 
and many returning for keeping the 
cost low.
In fact, Andy Jassy, the affable 
CEO of AWS, takes pride on how the 
company strives to give customers 
the best price possible. What 
Amazon pays, customers get. The 
cloud facility provider is beating the 
competition with this proposition 
and are miles apart in terms of 
market share from the competition. 
During the event, AWS announced 
a plethora of new services on top 
of already a massive list of tools 
customers have in at their disposal. 
Here are among the highlights for 
the AWS at re:Invent 2016.
AWS Announces Seven 
New Compute Services and 
Capabilities 
The service provider unveils the 
next generation of Amazon Elastic 
Compute 
Cloud 
(EC2) 
Memory 
Optimised, Compute Optimised, and 
High input/output (I/O) instances, 
and added two new hardware 
acceleration options to its range of 
computing services. 
The new F1 instance is the 
cloud’s first customer-programmable, 
hardware-accelerated 
compute 
instance with Field Programmable Gate 
Arrays (FPGAs). Amazon EC2 Elastic 
GPUs allow customers to easily attach 
low-cost, professional grade graphics 
acceleration to Amazon EC2 instances. 
AWS also announced Amazon Lightsail, 
a new way to get started with AWS that 
makes it easy to spin up powerful virtual 
private servers (VPS) that have bundled 
storage and networking with simple, 
monthly pricing. 
“With ten instance families, AWS 
offers customers, by far, the broadest 
and deepest range of compute 
functionality to support an incredibly 
wide range of applications. From 
very low cost, burstable T2 general-
purpose instances for websites 
and M4 instances for business 
applications like SAP, to our new P2 
instances for machine learning and 
HPC applications – and everything 
in between – AWS delivers the right 
compute option for virtually any 
workload today,” says Matt Garman, 
Vice President, Amazon EC2. 
“Most companies have many 
diverse applications with varying 
requirements. They’ve told us having 
the ability to choose the right instance 
for the right workload allows them to 
have optimal price performance and 
move faster. We expanded this range 
of options even further by adding a 

97
JAN 2017
way to help customers get started 
quickly 
with 
Amazon 
Lightsail, 
introducing the next generation of 
our Memory, Compute, and Storage 
Optimised instance families, and 
delivering hardware acceleration 
with Elastic GPUs and FPGA-enabled 
F1 instances.”
Three New Amazon AI Services 
Unveiled 
AWS is making it easy for any 
developer to build apps that can 
understand natural language, turn 
text into lifelike speech, have 
conversations using voice or text, 
analyse 
images, 
and 
recognize 
faces, objects, and scenes. The three 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that 
make Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and 
Amazon Rekognition are based on the 
same proven, highly scalable Amazon 
technology built by the thousands of 
deep learning and machine learning 
experts across the company. 
Amazon AI services all provide 
high-quality, 
high-accuracy 
AI 
capabilities that are scalable and 
cost-effective. Amazon AI services 
are fully managed services so there 
are no deep learning algorithms to 
build, no machine learning models to 
train, and no up-front commitments or 
infrastructure investments required. 
This frees developers to focus on 
defining and building an entirely new 
generation of apps that can see, hear, 
speak, understand, and interact with 
the world around them. 
Until now, very few developers 
have been able to build, deploy, and 
broadly scale apps with AI capabilities 
because doing so required access to 
vast amounts of data, and specialised 
expertise in machine learning and 
neural networks. Effectively applying 
AI involves extensive manual effort 
to develop and tune many different 
types of machine learning and deep 
learning algorithms (e.g. automatic 
speech recognition, natural language 
understanding, image classification), 
collect and clean the training data, and 
train and tune the machine learning 
models. And this process must be 
repeated for every object, face, voice, 
and language feature in an application. 
Amazon AI services eliminate all 
of this heavy lifting, making AI broadly 
accessible to all app developers 
by offering Amazon’s powerful and 
proven 
deep 
learning 
algorithms 
and technologies as fully managed 
services that any developer can access 
through an API call or a few clicks 
in the AWS Management Console. 
Amazon AI services make the full 
power of Amazon’s natural language 
understanding, speech recognition, 
text-to-speech, and image analysis 
technologies available at any scale, for 
any app, on any device, anywhere. 
“The 
combination 
of 
better 
algorithms and broad access to 
massive amounts of data and cost-
effective computing power provided 
by the cloud is making AI a reality 
for application developers. AWS is 
home to some of the most innovative 
and creative AI applications in use 
today,” says Raju Gulabani, VP, 
Databases, Analytics, and AI, AWS. 
“Thousands of machine learning 
and deep learning experts across 
Amazon have been developing AI 
technologies for years to predict 
what customers might like to read, 
to drive efficiencies in our fulfilment 
centres 
through 
robotics 
and 
computer vision technologies, and 
to give customers our AI-powered 
virtual assistant, Alexa. Now, we are 
making the technology underlying 
these innovations available to any 
developer in the form of three fully 
managed Amazon AI services that 
are easy to use, powerful, and cost 
effective. We are excited to see how 
customers use Amazon Lex, Amazon 
Polly, and Amazon Rekognition to 
build a new generation of apps that 
have human-like intelligence and can 
see, hear, speak, and interact with 
people and their environments.”
AWS Offers Two New Hybrid 
Services to Help Customers 
With 
the 
proliferation 
of 
IoT 
devices, enterprises are increasingly 
managing on-premises infrastructure 
that is not located in a data centre, 
such as connected devices in 
factories, oil wells, agricultural 
fields, hospitals, cars, and various 
other venues. This is where the AWS 
Greengrass comes in.
AWS Greengrass is a software 
which allows customers to run 
AWS compute, messaging, data 
caching, and sync capabilities on 
connected 
devices. 
With 
AWS 
Greengrass, devices can run AWS 
Lambda functions to perform tasks 
locally, keep device data in sync, 
and communicate with other devices 
while leveraging the full processing, 
analytics, and storage power of the 
AWS Cloud. 
AWS also announces a new 
Snowball data transfer appliance. It is 
a petabyte-scale data transfer service 
that uses secure appliances to allow 
customers to transfer large amounts 
of data to and from AWS at as little 
as one-fifth of the cost of using high-
speed internet connections. 
The AWS Snowball Edge can 
transport two times more data than 
the original AWS Snowball (up to 100 
TB), and includes AWS Greengrass, 
making it a purpose-built hybrid edge 
device that can transfer data to and 
from Amazon Simple Storage Service 
(Amazon S3) cluster with other 
Snowball Edge devices to form an on-
premises storage pool, and run AWS 
Lambda to process and analyse data. 
Since AWS introduced the AWS 
Snowball data transfer service in 
October 2015, customers have sent 
AWS Snowball devices a distance 
equal to circling the world more 
than 100 times. The new Snowball 
Edge appliance has all the durability, 
portability, security, and ease-of-use 
of a Snowball, but can hold twice as 
much data as the original Snowball 
– up to 100 TB – and has four times 
the network speed, built in WiFi and 
cellular wireless communication, and 
a Network File System (NFS) interface 
with an Amazon S3-compatible 
endpoint that allows the Snowball 
Edge to connect to the cloud and pass 
data back and forth with Amazon S3. 
Customers can also cluster 
multiple 
AWS 
Snowball 
Edge 
devices to create a storage pool and 
easily mount the Snowball Edge 
devices into existing data centre 
rack environments.  
Workday

the 
AWS Cloud, or they can continue 
leveraging Workday data centres. 
Workday intends to first make this 
option available to customers in 
Canada in calendar year 2017, and 
expects to expand the scope to other 
geographies over time in consultation 
with its customers.
“With AWS – the proven 
leader in cloud infrastructure – as 
Workday’s preferred public cloud 
provider for production workloads, 
our customers will have a choice to 
deploy and drive business value with 
Workday’s suite of applications,”

CEO, Workday. 
“The ability to run our applications 
on the AWS Cloud underscores our 
commitment to deliver the security, 
reliability, and continuous innovation 
our customers expect when it comes 
to infrastructure, while continually 
expanding the ways they can 
optimise workforce productivity and 
business performance.”
Jassy adds: “The world’s most 
innovative and successful companies 
rely on AWS for secure, robust global 
infrastructure and the broadest set 
of cloud services. We are excited to 
help support Workday’s rapid pace of 
innovation by giving their customers

SPOTLIGHT
DATO’ CALVIN CHAN OF LEAGOO GIVES US A ONE-ON-ONE ON HOW 
LEAGOO FARES IN TODAY’S SMARTPHONE MARKET.
LEAGOO WANTS 
TO TAKE THE LEAD
Having been the CEO of Leagoo Malaysia 
for two years now, Dato’ Calvin Chan 
still feels he has something to prove 
of himself when it comes to Leagoo as 
a smartphone brand. I had the chance 
to speak with him during the launch of 
Leagoo’s latest flagship, the Leagoo T1 Plus.

JAN 2017
PC.com: For all our readers who do not 
know yet, can you tell us Leagoo’s latest 
smartphone, the T1 Plus?
Dato’ Calvin: The Leagoo T1 Plus is first and 
foremost, a selfie smartphone. It’s a device designed 
to give you everything you ever hoped for in a 
mobile device. It comes with a Sony 13-megapixel 
front-facing camera, making it an excellent phone 
to take selfies. It’s rear camera is also equipped 
with a 13-megapixel camera, making it a one-stop 
device when it comes to taking photos. The T1 Plus 
also comes with a powerful fingerprint scanner 
that can unlock your device in just 0.19 seconds. 
It also comes with 3GB RAM, which is great for 
unprecedented performance, stability and multi-
tasking capabilities. The 5.5-inch display screen 
will also provide our users with an excellent visual 
experience; this goes to show that we at Leagoo 
are committed to providing our users with a high-
end device at an affordable price.
PC.com: With the T1 Plus being priced at RM699, 
do you see it being a serious competitor to the 
likes of Huawei, Xiaomi and Samsung, to name 
a few.
Dato’ Calvin: Honestly speaking, in regards to the 
current market, I wouldn’t consider us a serious 
competitor as we are still a new company to enter the 
market. Currently, we’re trying our best to do more to 
expose our brand. Our goal is to increase the brand 
awareness and exposure of Leagoo in Malaysia. From 
there, we aim to create even better products for the 
consumers. Hopefully by then, we will be considered 
as a serious competitor to the bigger brands.
PC.com: For Leagoo’s official HQ, what made 
you finally decide to open your doors?
Dato’ Calvin: The opening for the HQ has actually 
been in the planning stage for quite some time 
now and it is a necessary step in order to maintain 
a dynamic organisation structure. In addition to 
that, its a step into the right direction with all 
the constructive and positive feedback we’ve 
received over the year. With the establishment of 
this HQ, it is a one-stop point to smoothen out all 
organisational structures; from our marketing to 
logistics department, it will all be housed under 
one roof. Located in our HQ is also our 3S centre, 
making it a lot easier and more accessible to all 
our existing and future Leagoo users.
PC.com: Do you plan on opening other HQ’s 
around Malaysia like in JB, Penang or Ipoh?
Dato’ Calvin: Currently, we’ve already established 
three additional centres in JB and in KL so we’ll 
be adding three more centres around Malaysia by 
the end of 2016. We also plan to establish one 
HQ per state in Malaysia, making it easier for our 
users from different states to head to their nearest 
centre instead of driving all the way down to KL.
PC.com: After Malaysia, does Leagoo plan to 
branch out into other countries in Southeast 
Asia?
Dato’ Calvin: That is one of our plans for the future. 
Our next step would be introducing Leagoo into the 
India market, seeing as its the biggest smartphone 
market in the world. Also, there are plenty of users 
in India who are still stuck on 2G network service 
so this is a big opportunity for us to develop the 
smartphone market. Given the chance, we are also 
planning on introducing Leagoo to the rest of the 
world. For starters, we’ll be participating in Mobile 
World Congress held in the Mobile World Capital 
Barcelona in 2017. From there, we will gauge the 
crowds response and plan accordingly from there.
PC.com: What can we expect from Leagoo in 
2017?
Dato’ Calvin: We have huge plans for 2017! 
Before Q4, we plan to erect 1,000 signboards in 
strategic locations around Malaysia to further 
penetrate into the minds of Malaysians. We are 
also planning to introduce several new flagships 
and premium devices to cater to the needs and 
wants of the consumers. Apart from that, we are 
looking to expand our concept stores as well as 
service centres to make them more accessible to 
the public.

imagine this: A group of senior 
directors in a boardroom are 
about to make a key decision 
on the future of the company, 
which is losing out to more disruptive 
competitors. Most of the decision-
makers around the table are men who 
have been with the firm for over 20 
years, and know the company inside-
out. what’s the problem?
The lack of diverse representation 
on the board often results in 
groupthink – the tendency of 
members in a group to agree early 
on for fear of upsetting the status 
quo. Another phenomenon at work is 
that of exclusion. Those who do not 
feel that they are part of the team 
tend to contribute less to business 
objectives. There are companies that 
have already shown how management 
I
Fuelling innovation
Through diversity and inclusion
teams comprising executives with the 
same background may not necessarily 
survive disruptive changes. 
in the rapidly-evolving business 
world 
today, 
companies 
that 
embrace the principles of diversity 
and inclusion are more likely to have 
a loyal workforce and sustainable 
pipeline of ideas that can help them 
thrive despite changes.
Creativity through 
diversity and inclusion
in today’s age of hyper-competition, 
creativity and innovation are the 
lynchpins for the future success of 
most organisations. Organisations 
need to maximise and harness 
diverse knowledge to spark great 
ideas. 
Diversity 
of 
talent, 
by 
definition, opens doors to more ideas 
and perspectives that can produce 
the best business outcomes. 
There  is strong evidence to support 
this: research of high performing 
companies by professional services 
provider Towers watson Malaysia 
has shown that Diversity and 
inclusion is one of the key drivers 
for employee attraction, engagement 
and retention resulting in improved 
business performance.
Global perspectives
For organisations operating in the 
multi-national landscape, diversity 
leads to better understanding of 
customers in different markets. it 
takes a broad spectrum of diverse 
minds, cultures and experiences to 
connect with different audience. And 
that leads to better business. 
As a multi-national company with 
offices and customers in every market 
across five continents, Dell has seen 
the benefits of having an international 
workforce made up of employees with 
different professional and personal 
backgrounds. Diversity has propelled 
Dell employees to be able to work 
effectively in cross-border teams, 
enabling them to deliver quality 
products and services to clients in 
different markets. 
The role of inclusive 
leadership
One of the first things that any 
company can do in their journey 
towards diversity and inclusion is to 
ensure that its leaders make their 
intentions clear. Catalyst Research 
has identified four leadership traits 
inview

103

that foster the key ingredients of 
inclusion, namely prioritising business 
objectives over personal interests; the 
ability to accept criticism, willingness 
to empower subordinates, and the 
expectation that subordinates take 
responsibility for their actions. 
Successful companies can take 
inclusive leadership to heart with 
personality assessments that raise 
the leadership team’s self-awareness 
of leadership styles. Diversity and 
inclusion-related goals should be 
part of individual assessments for 
leaders, as we have done so at 
Dell. i’ve personally made use of 
the Hogan Personality inventory to 
raise the leadership team’s self-
awareness of their leadership styles. 
Communication alone is not enough; 
awareness should translate into 
action. we expect our leaders to 
meet three diversity and inclusion-
related goals.
Balancing diversity with 
inclusion
including diverse talent at every 
level of a company can drive tangible 
business 
benefits. 
Recognising 
diversity alone however can lead 
to employees feeling singled-out or 
stereotyped, ironically promoting 
exclusion. The key is ensuring that 
there is a common ground for all, so 
everyone feels they belong. 
in a world that is constantly 
evolving, managing diversity and 
championing an inclusive culture are 
essential to our collective success. 
inclusiveness 
encourage 
team 
members to go beyond the ‘call of 
duty’ to help each other. Attitudes 
like these are crucial to business 
success today. At the end of the 
day, it is all about recognising that 
everyone is unique and building a 
common ground in an environment of 
trust, where anyone can share if they 
feel excluded in any way. 
There is still work to be done when 
it comes to women in a traditionally 
male-dominated technology sector 
for example - the talent pool of 
female iT professionals has been 
decreasing over the years and the 
number of female CiOs remains at 
around 11% worldwide. Society 
could be much more diverse in the 
next 20 to 30 years, but as it stands 
now, we have to declare our goals 
to this end if we want things to 
move forward.

I waited patiently! 10 years of it, waiting for this 
day to come and it finally did.
Having been in development since 2006, FFXV did 
not have a smooth ride to where it is today, even 
changing the original director and character designer, 
Tetsuya Nomura for Hajime Tabata. However, all that 
seems to be for the better as FFXV breaks the mold of 
traditional Final Fantasy games that is usually packed 
with an overly-convoluted and complex storyline...

umping Right Into It
My biggest regret was not being able to 
take time off work to fully enjoy all FFXV 
has to offer, so here are some words of 
advice – take the week off if you must, it is worth 
it. With that being said, Square Enix has outdone 
themselves on FFXV. From its Active Cross Battle 
(ACB) System to travelling across the region of Eos 
as you aim to complete all the side quests even 
before getting into the main storyline.
The story unfolds with Noctis and his band of 
loveable yet mildly annoying friends with snide 
comments (which somewhat reminds me of my own 
group of friends) – Gladioulus, Ignis and Prompto as 
you make your way through Eos to retrieve the lost 
weapons of Lucii, which belonged to the ancient 
kings of Lucis. Along the way, Noct and his friends 
will encounter various beasts, daemons and foes 
alike while still being able to enjoy long journey car 
rides with running commentary, shopping, cooking 
and eating Ignis’ new recipes or taking wefies 
thanks to Prompto’s superior photography skills.
The point lead game designer Wan Azmer – who 
is Malaysian by the way – was trying to implement 
into the game is how players would actually take 
roadtrips with friends that comes along with an 
adventure of its own, witty banter and the like. On 
that front, square enix has pulled off perfectly.
Fight All The Beasts
Changing the pace from the Active Time Battle (ATB) 
System that was first introduced in FFIV, FFXV has 
since come a long way with its new and improved 
ACB System, which is more than just your average 
hack-n-slash battle system; the guys over at Square 
Enix made sure of that. Every beast and daemon has 
different weaknesses, so being able to plan your 
weapons and elemental magic on-the-fly is a crucial 
part of your strategy. 
Another great feature that comes with the ACB 
System is the ability to pair up with your pals who 
has a range of special abilities that can make your 
a battles a lot easier, called Links. One key skill to 
have in your arsenal is definitely Ignis’ ‘Regroup’ 
ability, which grants full HP and MP regeneration 
while forming a close circle around Noct. This 
allows you to plan your next move of attack without 
having your allies in the crossfire.
Aside from normal attacks, Noct also comes 
with an ability called Warp Strike; it allows you 
to blink towards an enemy to cause considerable 
damage, which could break an appendage of a foe, 
leading to higher damage output. You could also 
warp to various areas on the battlefield called Warp 
Points, where you can regenerate HP and MP while 
being invulnerable to attacks.
A great combination would be to start the Warp 
Strike with a Greatsword or Polearm and following 
it up with a flurry of attacks from a Sword or Daggers 
to deal the most damage in a short amount of time.
One way to get the most out of Noct and his 
friends is through the Ascension tree where you will 
spend ability points (AP) to unlock greater abilities 
to use in and out of combat. Being the game’s main 
skill tree, the Ascension section allows for a wide 
range of abilities to be unlocked, some of which 
will also grant you experience points (EXP) and even 
more AP. You could be fishing, driving around or 
riding on a Chocobo, all these everyday activities 
could land you more AP than you could imagine!
Roadtrip!
One core element of FFXV is the roadtrip you take 
with your friends – depending on which side of 
the fence you’re on, it could be really entertaining 
or just a complete waste of time while your brain 
slowly turns into mush – where you can travel to all 
sorts of different outposts, towns and cities around 
Eos. As you journey around the vast open world, 
you will encounter various side quests to fulfill for 
non-playable characters (NPCs), take part in hunts 
provided by owners of the diner and also do battle 
with random enemies.
All this accumulates to gaining EXP, which can 
be pooled to a significant amount before being 
tallied up and gaining a higher level. The only way 
for this to happen to actually spend the night at 
‘Havens’, which are campsites located all around 
Eos or spending Gil at an inn. A good tactic that has 
worked out for me so far is to amass a large amount 
of EXP (I had about 100,000 worth), save up 10,000 
Gil and spend the night at the inn located at Galdin 
Quay. However, you should only do this once you 
reach level 10, otherwise moving forward with the 
main storyline will be rather difficult.
When on the road, you will also come across 
procurement points where you can pick up random 
items all around that could be consumable items 
like Potions, cooking ingredients, equipment for 
your team or even ore’s that can then be used on the 
Regalia to give it a fresh and new look. However, 
be sure not to travel at night as that is when more 
dangerous and high levels daemons will be roaming 
about so if you want to avoid digging yourself into 
a grave, best to keep to the outposts and towns 
during the night until you’re at a sufficient level (I 
had to wait until I was above level 30 and even then 
it was a tough fight wandering about at night).
The only problem I have with the roadtrips is 
its fast travel option, which appears when you are 
too far from your desired destination that the game 
allows you to fast travel to said destination for only 
10 Gil (sounds like a fair deal, no?). What it fails 
to mention is the long loading time in-between 
the travel that makes me want to gauge my eyes 
out and feed it to my neighbour’s cat (it meows 
incessently throughout the night, ruining my quality 
time with the game). Aside from that, there is barely 
any loading screen time for a game that actually 
takes up almost 60GB worth of space on my PS4!
Relive The Classics
I speak on behalf of all Final Fantasy fans when 
they say that one of the most memorable moments 
of their favourite game would be the music score. 
As a fan of FFVII and FFIX, the music score on both 
games take me back to a time where life was a lot 
simpler, responsibilities were at a minimum and the 
only time you got your heart broken was when you 
would lose in said game and not through the cold 
embrace of a significant other (I had a very difficult 
childhood, let’s leave it at that).

score:
AWESOME
The leading composer for FFXV is Yoko 
Shimomura, who was also in charge of the music 
score for the Kingdom Hearts series (another 
personal favourite of mine). The music is spot-on as 
it blends exceptionally well into the game, switching 
between battle sequences and adventuring 
perfectly. Every outpost and town also comes with 
its own unique music score, giving every location its 
own identity to the game.
A throwback that Square Enix saw fit to put into 
the game is giving players the chance to purchase 
the soundtracks of the previous Final Fantasy games 
where they can then listen and reminisce along to 
whilst driving around. Imagine listening to the tunes 
of the older Final Fantasy games while cruising around 
in the Regalia, how great does that sound right! (I’m 
actually guilty for doing that in real life too. Yes I am 
single and very much available, save me, please.)
Eat Anything and Everything
A good rule of thumb to follow is to never play FFXV 
during the middle of the night or when you’re starving. 
This is because of the realism that has been implemented 
into the game, from the forests to the vast land you are 
travelling and even to the food! Malaysians in particular 
will be particular pleased with the food served in FFXV 
as one town – which I will not name because I can – 
serves up our very own local delicacies like Roti Canai, 
Satay and even Chicken Rice!
Thanks to the input of Wan Azmer, Malaysian 
delicies will be noticed throughout the world for 
gamers who will actually pay attention to what they 
are eating. Mind you, having a meal in FFXV will 
cost you quite a bit of Gil so it’s best to actually 
head out to your neighbourhood mamak to get your 
fill before actually having it in the game.
A Happy Kid Once Again
I can still remember the childlike wonders and 
happiness I had when I completed the old Final 
Fantasy games on the PS1 and PS2. FFXV has 
brought me back there once again and I am not 
even halfway done with it! Suffice to say, Square 
Enix have really knocked it out of the park; whether 
it’s the battle system, the straightforward storyline, 
the attention-to-detail on graphics or just the little 
throwbacks like music, my faith in them has since 
been restored and I am patiently – although it won’t 
last long – waiting for the FFVII remake as well as 
Kingdom Hearts 3.

have never been a fan of FPS games on a console as I feel that FPS is meant for PC games, much like how racing 
games should be strictly for consoles. With that being said, I do enjoy games like Overwatch, Battleborn and of 
course Destiny but all those aren’t FPS, strictly speaking as they have a decent MOBA element added into it seeing 
as you have more things to do other than going for headshot kills while camping. While I may have flirted with Call of 
Duty (COD) every now and then, I have never had the chance to fully experience what playing COD is like... until now.

Stay Away!
I cannot stress this enough, stay away from the 
multiplayer option, especially if you want to keep 
your sanity, patience and controllers in check. After 
finally downloading the digital copy of the game 
(where I also had to delete majority of my other  
games due to the sheer size of the download file), 
I immediately jumped into the multiplayer feature 
rather than trying out the campaign because you 
gotta learn to run before you can walk right (I may 
have gotten that analogy wrong)?
What followed was three hours of having 
an Arabic-sounding dude either telling me that 
I’m really good at the game or that he wants to 
sell me to ISIS in exchange for three goats and 
a laptop, I’m not really sure. I digress; although 
the multiplayer system in Infinite Warfare was 
done beautifully (props to Infinity Ward for getting 
it right!), there’s only so much you can to do the 
amount of toxicity that occurs in every multiplayer 
game, especially when it’s as competitive as COD. 
Much like every other competitive multiplayer 
system, there will always be one, two or even 
four people on your team who are just there to 
screw things up, making it that much harder for 
you to actually prove that you aren’t as bad as your 
opponent thinks.
Another aspect of the multiplayer system is the 
cooperative multiplayer game mode – Zombies. 
It also comes with its own gameplay mechanics 
and story, making it a great game mode to play 
with your friends. What I love about Zombies is 
the light-hearted fun that is injected into the game 
rather than making it in the same setting as the 
campaign mode. 
Let’s Get Down To Business
Taking place in the distant future where Earth has 
become a giant dystopian wasteland and stripped 
of all natural resources because we humans just 
love polluting it, you gain control of the UNSA 
special forces team where you are sent to a secret 
UNSA secret weapons facility in Europa after 
discovering that the SDF – former militants of the 
UNSA – have infiltrated it. Although the gameplay 
itself for the first mission doesn’t last more than 
a couple of minutes, it was a good of introducing 
new players like myself to the mechanics of the 
game. In terms of gameplay, I have to say that I 
am quite impressed with what Infinite Warfare 
have to offer. Although it’s your typical point-and-
shoot system with very little to go on, the fact 
that its set in the futuristic world where jumping 
onto a spaceship and flying into outer space is like 
driving, it makes the whole experience that much 
sweeter.
One of the things I loved about Infinite Warfare 
was the cameo appearances by actual celebrities 
and sports personalities like UFC Lightweight 
Champion Conor McGregor as well as lauded 
Formula One racer, Lewis Hamilton. But, what set 
my heart over the moon about Infinite Warfare 
was the actor who portrayed the main protaganist, 
Rear Admiral Salen Kotch, leader of the SDF. I 
won’t release any spoilers as to who it is but I can 
give you a clue: he knows nothing.
Controlled Chaos
The wide array of weapons is another great 
feature I loved about Infinite Warfare as it gave 
you a wider variety of choices on how you would 
like to eliminate your opponents in a much more 
disgusting way than the time your mom went 
down on them. From assault rifles to SMGs and 
even shotguns and rocket launchers, there’s just 
so many way to revel in your destruction. Sadly, 
you will have to be in multiplayer mode to fully 
experience the wonders and joy of having these 
weapons and taking your enemies out.
Aside from the weapons, COD also introduced 
an all-new system class called “Combat Rigs” 
where you can choose from six different classes 
of futuristic, high-tech combat gear that is also 
customisable to suit your playstyle. For me 
personally, I almost always stuck with the Synaptic 
Combat Rig as it has always been in my nature to 
be up-close-and-personal with my enemy so I can 
rub it in their faces when I gun them down. Sadly, 
more often than not, I’m the one getting gunned 
down and that’s when the flames and cusses start 
flying my way as usual (after careful consideration, 
I realised I may very well be the toxic player on my 
team... nah it can’t be, I’m too good).
Last Thoughts
If you are a fan of the COD series and have been 
a follower for quite some time, Infinite Warfare is 
worth getting. Although I’m not a fan of the series, 
I did enjoy the game as it was something different 
for me and I am considering actually taking COD 
semi-seriously and just chucking Overwatch out 
the window (Reaper is horrible). From the gameplay 
to the story and especially Zombies mode, Infinite 
Warfare was a joy to play and I can see myself 
actually persuading my friends to join me (that is if 
this review doesn’t grab their attention).

rom the guys that brought you Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy’s The Division and of course, Just Dance (best 
game ever!), Ubisoft comes out with Watch Dogs 2, following up on the marginally successful debut of Watch 
Dogs. Let the record state that this will be my first ever video game from Ubisoft, ever.

AVERAGE
I Am Mr. Robot
Much like Rami Malek’s character in the popular TV 
series, I finally understood what it was like to be a 
hacker (aside from committing B&E’s, grand theft 
auto and amongst many other crimes). For a hacker, I 
am actually quite flexible as I could parkour all around 
San Francisco and even through Silicon Valley.
The story starts you off as protagonist Marcus 
Hollaway, a young hacker from Oakland, California 
as he is wrongfully punished for a crime he didn’t 
commit thanks to the upgraded central Operating 
system – ctOS 2.0. Following the events of Chicago, 
San Francisco is the next city to install ctOS and you 
find yourself working with DedSec alongside fellow 
hackers to take it down and save the city (aren’t 
hackers meant to create chaos and destruction, as 
per what Annonymous does or have I been reading 
it wrong this entire time?)
It Only Got Better
One of the major changes and improvements to 
the series was the driving element, which was 
appalling in the first Watch Dogs. Reminding me 
of the maniacal destruction that could be caused 
behind the wheel in GTA V, Watch Dogs 2 was 
highly reminiscent of that. The overall hacking 
experience was also drastically improved from the 
first instalment as it was a lot more interactive 
and intuitive, making it that much easier to hack in 
security cameras, laptops and the such to plan your 
next move of attack. For me personally however, 
I am not a fan of the whole stealth-based attack 
gameplay as I’ve always been a firm believer of 
charging headfirst into the battle and thinking about 
the consequences later (the same can be said about 
my approach into my daily life, to a certain extent).
Another great way to hack and infiltrate during 
missions is to use the trusty remote-controlled 
vehicles like drones and RC cars where you can 
just pilot them into the system and do the hacking 
remotely while you’re away from the dangers and 
perils of minimum wage security guards and such. 
Although this does make the stealth element of the 
game mundane, it does add a whole new level of 
gameplay and excitement as this will be the closest I 
ever get the ever piloting a drone.
Aside from the main storyline, Watch Dogs 2 has 
a lot of different side quests for you to do if you ever 
felt like you just needed a break from toppling an 
evil organisation and just felt like being a personal 
driver for someone (much like how an Uber works). 
The Realism Is Unreal
Much like GTA V and how much Los Santos looks 
like Los Angeles, Watch Dogs 2 does a great job at 
capturing the heart and essence of San Francisco, 
a place I’ve only ever visited once and have been 
dying to go back since. One thing I have to give to 
Ubisoft is its ability to recreate cities from real life 
and putting them into its games, like Assassin’s 
Creed and its take on the cities of old from France, 
Italy and such. One thing I do appreciate about 
video games these days is its connection to real 
life and in that aspect, Watch Dogs 2 has definitely 
done itself justice.
Another aspect of Watch Dogs 2 I loved was 
the hacking; real hackers were actually brought into 
the game as consultants to validate scripts as well 
as the mechanics of the game for its authenticity. 
The puzzle game element that is involved with the 
hacking is challenging, to say the least but not 
impossible to finish. 
Not All Rainbows and Butterflies
As great as Ubisoft tried to make Watch Dogs 2 
after the horrors of the first instalment, there are 
still plenty of problems Ubisoft has not addressed 
but simply just threw under the carpet and decided it 
would be dealt with at a later time. Although driving 
in Watch Dogs 2 is far better than the first, a lot can 
be said about the shooting and weapon mechanics 
in Watch Dogs 2 as it just isn’t great, especially 
for an open-world thid-person shooter perspective. 
Comparing it to GTAV, the shooting and weapons 
mechanics is downright mediocre, sad to say. The 
stealth-based missions are also on the same level 
as it doesn’t provide much of a challenge and they 
end up being repetitive and boring. Compared to 
Assassin’s Creed and Uncharted 4, where stealth 
is a key factor in the gameplay, Watch Dog 2 just 
pales in comparison.

Cyberfusion 2016 hosts a total of 200 gamers spending three days, two nights - 
gaming to their hearts’ content
nown as a place where 
gamers from all walks of 
life can gather to share 
a common interest in, 
Cyberfusion has grown since its 
inception back when CRT monitors 
were still the biggest technological 
advancement. Famous for being 
the biggest LAN party in Southeast 
Asia and still the longest non-stop 
gaming LAN party in the world, 
Cyberfusion 2016 took place from 9 
to 11 December 2016 with a total of 
RM20,000 in prizes. 
Held at Colnnov8 at Cyberjaya, 
this 3 days, 2 nights event saw a 
total of 200 gamers spending 72 
hours in total together in the same 
venue, playing all sorts of games 
from eSports fan favourites like Dota 
2, League of Legends, Overwatch 
and CSGO and even popular console 
games like Street Fighter V and 
FIFA17. Of course, Cyberfusion also 
had plenty of activities in stored for 
the participants, especially its yearly 
tradition of Game Beasts.
“Since the early days of LAN 
parties in the mid-90s, Cyberfusion 
has grown to become one of 
Malaysia’s go-to eSports events. 
These sort of get-togethers can be 
held among a small group of friends 
in one’s living room or it can be 
massive events which bring people 
together in a public area. Regardless 
of the scale of LAN parties, engaging 
with like-minded individuals can 
be very fulfilling. Hence, we’re very 
pleased to provide that face-to-face 
contact among gamers in CoInnov8, a 
collaborative space that we launched 
recently. What CoInnov8 represents 
is a convergence of ideas for 
growth and improvement, rooted in 
collaboration and interaction among 
one another. In many ways, this is 
the same principle that Cyberfusion 
operates on – a sense of camaraderie 
while being engaged in something 
you’re really passionate about,” says 
Dato’ Faris Yahaya, Managing Director 
of Cyberview Sdn Bhd.
“And as our own experience 
with collaborative spaces show, 
CoInnov8 represents a fusion of the 
old and the new in meeting the social 
and professional needs of a new 
K
generation of digital nomads for whom 
the lines between work and play are 
often blurred. These are the types of 
spaces with the potential to catalyse 
the kind of collaborative innovation 
that will hopefully see the rise of 
a whole new generation of digital 
startups and we look forward to seeing 
Cyberjaya playing an even bigger 
role in supporting the nation’s play 
in building a strong and sustainable 
digital economy,” he adds. 
“We’re very pleased to 
provide that face-to-face 
contact among gamers in

he last patch update from 
IceFrog 
(Valve’s 
leading 
game designer for Dota 2) 
was 6.88 back  in the middle 
of 2016. With the latest patch already 
causing waves of rumours among avid 
Dota fans, professionals and reddit 
forums alike, it was only a matter 
of time before Valve introduced it 
to the public. Not soon after Valve’s 
quarterly Majors tournament in 
Boston ended did it dish out its latest 
patch – 7.00 and along with it, a new 
revolution for Dota 2 had begun.
Known as ‘The New Journey’, 
the latest patch revealed Valve’s first 
original hero – Sun Wukong who is 
also known as the Monkey King. This 
latest addition also came with its 
very own arcana aesthetic item along 
with a new terrain and an announcer 
t
“there is also a new loadout 
screen before the game begins 
alongside a new strategy phase 
where you can coordinate 
your plan of attack with your 
teammates.”
the YeAr of the MonkeY
An ever-changing game, Dota 2 releases patch 7.00
pack. The Dota 2 HUD also received 
massive changes with a new in-game 
interface that focuses on a much 
smaller footprint overall for your 
hero control console, the shop and 
courier controls as well as the top bar 
scoreboard and minimap.
A new addition to the patch also 
saw a talent tree given to every 
hero with its own unique way of 
leveling up and scaling according to 
the game’s situation. There is also a 
new loadout screen before the game 
begins alongside a new strategy 
phase where you can coordinate your 
plan of attack with your teammates, 
something that is much needed for 
the community as a whole. Another 
great addition is the ‘Backpack’, 
where you are allowed to carry an 
additional three items onto your hero 
console along with the original six 
items that has been part of Dota 2 
since the beginning when it was still 
under Warcraft III.
But the biggest change was of 
course what the community calls 
the ‘Nerf Hammer’ as majority of the 
100+ heroes in the hero pool received 
significant buffs and nerfs to their 
abilities and stats, thus making the 
game more balanced while still 
ensuring lesser played heroes get 
picked more and the overpowered 
heroes get left behind. This allows 
for a wider range of strategies and 
picks as well as hero combinations 
that could not have worked in the 
earlier patches.
