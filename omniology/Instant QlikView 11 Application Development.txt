About the Author
B. Diane Blackwood has worked as a consultant implementing business intelligence 
and corporate performance management solutions since 2005. She has extensive 
experience in multiple industries (micro electronics to heavy equipment manufacturing, 
medical, legal, and various retail industries) implementing BI and CPM solutions. In 2010, 
she worked with El Camino Hospital creating data warehouse/data marts to feed QlikView, 
a "social business discovery" software. Working closely with Dr. Michael Gallagher, formerly 
Director of Informatics at El Camino Hospital, his enthusiasm for the uses of QlikView in 
analyzing hospital and medical data "infected" her.
Diane and her husband, Bob, moved from Chicago to Albuquerque in June of 2012. He took 
early retirement from the City Colleges of Chicago, and they have had Albuquerque on their 
short list of retirement locations since 1997.
In the past, Diane has written several biographic encyclopedia articles including articles on 
Charles Babbage, Erving Goffman and Isaac Asimov.
Thank you to Dr. Bob Blackwood for proofreading the sentence structures 
and punctuation.
Thank you to Dr. Michael Gallagher for first showing me prescribing pattern 
analysis with QlikView.

About the Reviewer
Theofilopoulos (LefTy) Eleftherios has an extensive background in business intelligence 
accumulating over a decade of working solely in this field with another decade in general 
programming and hardware dismantling as a hobby. Starting from a data center in Europe 
and organizing reporting for a huge multinational company, to numerous banks and financial 
institutions his interest and expertise grew over the years. He likes to work on an end-to-end 
basis as he says, from designing the infrastructure, database schemas, cubes, and whatever 
else is necessary to provide the end result; precise and timely reporting or end user applications 
in a variety of languages and frameworks. He is not focused on a certain brand of database 
or tools, and has experience with Microsoft, Oracle, Teradata, MySQL, MariaDB, and Mongo 
as backends and Cognos, Microsoft, Tableau, Tibco, and QlikView as frontends and almost 
everything in between. He is an avid open source advocate, strongly believing in and supporting 
community efforts such as the Python and R languages.
He started working in DHL Prague, at the moment of the transition of numerous individual 
service centers to a centralized data center in the heart of Europe. From there he moved on to 
Accenture and Komercni Banka before moving back to his birthplace, Greece, and continuing 
his career with Piraeus Bank for many years. Then he moved on to his beloved consulting and 
thus gained access to all of Greece's major Banks and Financial institutions. Nowadays he is 
employed by one of the biggest online travel agencies in Europe, Tripsta/Travelplanet24 and his 
focus remains unchanged; always enriching his expertise in the field of Data Science with the 
added variable of big data volumes the travel industry so aptly provides.
I would like to thank all of the wonderful people I have had the pleasure of 
working with, and of course my parents for always being there for me.

Preface
This book will teach the reader how to develop business intelligence applications 
with QlikView 11. QlikView 11 delivers enterprise-class analytics and search with 
the ease of use of office productivity software. The book is aimed at anyone who is 
interested in learning QlikView development and analysis.
QlikTech's belief is that all BI users can benefit from a fully-functional and 
interactive QlikView app experience.
                                                               —www.QlikView.com
Because QlikView 11 is available in a free personal edition and is so easy to use and 
set up, this book will focus on ideas about how to use QlikView while demonstrating 
the process of loading data and setting up dashboards; then using the dashboards 
to analyze data. Practical applications of QlikView 11 can be developed quickly 
with assistance from tutorials and help rather than waiting weeks for a Business 
Intelligence application to be delivered and still more weeks for dashboards and 
analytical applications as with the majority of the products on the market. This time 
saving experience makes QlikView an obvious addition to business (and personal) 
analysis tools.
What this book covers
Downloading, installing, and analyzing with QlikView (Simple) introduces you to 
the QlikView 11 interface while working with sample financial data available 
for download. The topics covered in this recipe include: when to use QlikView, 
navigating the interface, and creating your first QlikView sheet, sheet objects, and 
chart. Additional practice includes editing the script to load more than one sample 
file and automatically linking data.

Preface
2
Analyzing retirement locations (Intermediate) will explain how to create our own analysis 
from scratch in order to learn more about combining data from multiple sources and 
creating our own input to assist analysis. More sheet objects are introduced and more 
of the QlikView interface is explored. Sample data is available for download. More 
scripting examples for joining data are covered.
Using QlikView practically (Intermediate) explores where else QlikView has been used 
and how. It explores ideas of how else QlikView might be used and looks at other 
demonstration databases from QlikView to stimulate the thought processes of how 
you might want to use it. References are provided to additional website training and 
the QlikView Community to help you build your knowledge.
Sharing the wealth (of information) – scaling up (Intermediate) discusses various steps 
and options to scale up to an Enterprise application. This chapter also tells us where 
to find information about licensing, pricing, enterprise server requirements, data 
sources, and big data, and how to implement mobile applications.
Analyzing movies example (bonus recipe) is an analysis example that uses the 
QlikView Movie Database to demonstrate how analysis can be performed with 
an existing demonstration database from QlikView. This analysis also helps 
familiarize us with using the interface and provides examples of interface sheet 
creation for analysis along with more of the tools available. There are additional 
practice ideas included at the end of this chapter. This simple analysis covers 
terminology, analysis techniques, and tools intermediate to the Downloading, 
installing, and analyzing with QlikView and Analyzing retirement locations recipes.

Instant QlikView 11  
Application 
Development
QlikView 11 is a very easy-to-use business intelligence product. It is designed to facilitate 
relationship analysis rather than the more formal corporate performance and financial 
applications. It is designed to use a methodology of Direct Discovery, which is used to 
analyze data from multiple sources. QlikView 11 allows you to do your own business 
discovery, and take you quickly out of the data management stage and into the data 
relationship investigation stage.
With that in mind, when would you want to use QlikView 11? You would use it to analyze  
and quickly see trends and exceptions that—with normal financial application-oriented  
BI products—would not be readily apparent without days of consultant and technology 
department setup. With QlikView, you can analyze data relationships that are not  
measured in monetary units. Certainly, QlikView 11 can be used to analyze sales trends  
and stock performance, but other relationships soon become apparent when using QlikView. 
Human resource trends become apparent. Fantasy football factors can assist you with team 
choices along with tracking team performance. Textual analysis can indicate public opinion  
for political surveys, or sales and marketing.
Downloading, installing, and analyzing with 
QlikView (Simple)
This recipe will take you step-by-step on how to get started with QlikView. After downloading 
and installing QlikView 11 from the company website, we will load our first sets of data and 
begin our exploration of the QlikView interface for analysis.

How to do it...
Let us begin to examine the QlikView 11 application by opening the program:
1.	 Start QlikView by going to Start | All Program in Windows. After QlikView starts, you 
can begin to navigate around the program to familiarize yourself with the environment.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development

2.	 QlikView consists of two parts:


The sheet that can contain sheet objects such as charts or list boxes that 
show clickable information


The load script that stores information about the data and the  
data sources
3.	 To load data from an Excel sheet, use the options available on the Getting Started 
screen. This wizard can also help you create a basic document sheet that contains 
a chart.
4.	 To use data from other file types, click on the File Wizard: Type option present in 
Table Files | Edit Script.
5.	 Using the Edit Script dialog, we can view our data script, edit it in the script interface, 
and add other data sources. Reload the data by clicking on the Reload button. If we 
just want data from an existing QlikView file and to analyze the information in it, we 
do not need to work with the script at all.
6.	 After QlikView opens, we will see the default start screen. Here you will see a side 
menu with the following options:


The Getting Started option, which will be highlighted.


The Recently Opened Documents option shows the documents that were 
recently opened. This will be blank the first time QlikView is opened.


The Favorites option will also be empty at this point.


The Open in Server option allows you to register the QlikView Server if  
your company has an Enterprise QlikView license and is running QlikView 
from a server.


The Resources option from which you can follow links back to the QlikView 
website and see more examples.
7.	
In the lower-left corner, we have the option to uncheck the box to show the default 
screen when starting QlikView. Leave that option checked to make it easy to navigate 
to examples and training.
8.	 Currently, the Getting Started screen shows that you are running QlikView Personal 
Edition, with the Learning Center and Examples options.
The very first entry under Examples is Data Visualization. This is a very good tutorial on what 
types of charts to use to aid in visual discovery and understanding of your data relationships. 
You may want to take a few minutes to investigate this before continuing with the current recipe.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
10
Now, let's create our first QlikView document by loading data from Excel:
1.	 Under Learn QlikView in the Getting Started screen, click on Create a new QlikView 
document by loading data from an Excel file , as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 For this example, we will use some sample financial data downloaded from an 
accounting system into Excel. These files are available for download at the Packt 
Publishing website.
3.	 Review the data in Excel before you load it. There are six steps to the creation:
1.	 Select the data source. You can do this by clicking on Browse and navigating 
to the Excel file that you are going to analyze. First, we will  
load the LNData.xlsx file.
2.	 Verify the data and choose to use column headers from this datafile  
(or to create your own for each column in the data). With the sample data, 
we will use the existing column headers.
3.	 Save your new QlikView QVW file and give it a name of your choice.  
(For example, Sample.qvw)
4.	 Choose the chart type to create for our first sheet object. Here, because  
it is financial type data we are choosing a straight table type chart to start 
examining our sample data. 
5.	 Select the dimension(s) to use in our first chart. Here we have selected  
Acct-Group and CostCenter. Dimensions represent the columns of data 
from which we load the Excel file.
6.	 We add a mathematical expression such as a sum or an average. Just add 
the sum expression of the amount column we loaded.
Note that at step 6, we can check the box to launch Help.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
11
We have now created our first QlikView application. The following screenshot shows its look:
How it works...
Next, we will create more sheet objects, starting with a new list box to begin analyzing 
our loaded data. We can add dimensions for analysis. We can format our data and other 
enhancements by right-clicking on our sheet or our sheet objects that were created by the 
wizard. For example, with this data, we can add a box for the Company dimension data and 
format the data to have dollar signs and commas.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
12
To add the list box for a company, right-click in the blank area of the sheet, and choose New 
Sheet Object | List Box as shown in the following screenshot:
As you can see in the drop-down menu, there are multiple types of sheet objects to choose 
from such as List Box, Statistics Box, Chart, Input Box, Current Selections Box, Multi Box, 
Table Box, Button, Text Object, Line/Arrow Object, Slider/Calendar Object, and Bookmark 
Object. We will only cover a few of them in the course of this book.
The Help menu and extended examples that are available on the QlikView 
website will allow you to explore ideas beyond the scope of this book. The 
Help documentation for any item can be obtained by using the Help menu 
present on the top menu bar.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
13
Choose the List Box sheet object to add the company dimension to our analysis. The New List 
Box wizard has eight tabs: General, Expressions, Sort, Presentation, Number, Font, Layout, 
and Caption, as shown in the following screenshot:
Give the new List Box the title Company. The Object ID will be system generated. We choose 
the Company field from the fields available in the datafile that we loaded. We can check the 
Show Frequency box to show frequency in percent, which will only tell us how many account 
lines in October were loaded for each company. 
In the Expressions tab, we can add formulas for analyzing the data. Here, click on Add and 
choose Average. Since, we only have numerical data in the Amount field, we will use the 
Average aggregation for the Amount field. Don't forget to click on the Paste button to move 
your expression into the expression checker. The expression checker will tell you if  
the expression format is valid or if there is a syntax problem.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
14
If you forget to move your expression into the expression checker with 
the Paste button, the expression will not be saved and will not appear 
in your application.
The Sort tab allows you to change the Sort criteria from text to numeric or dates. We will not 
change the Sort criteria here.
The Presentation tab allows you to adjust things such as column or row header wrap, cell 
borders, and background pictures.
The Number tab allows us to override the default format to tell the sheet to format the data 
as money, percentage, or date for example. We will use this tab on our table box currently 
labeled Sum(Amount) to format the amount as money after we have finished creating our 
new company list box.
The Font tab lets us choose the font that we want to use, its display size, and whether to 
make our font bold.
The Layout tab allows us to establish and apply themes, and format the appearance of the 
sheet object, in this case, the list box.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
15
The Caption tab further formats the sheet object and, in the case of the list box, allows you 
to choose the icons that will appear in the top menu of the list box so that we can use those 
icons to select and clear selections in our list box. In this example, we have selected search, 
select all, and clear.
We can see that the percentage contribution to the amount and the average amount is 
displayed in our list box. Now, we need to edit our straight table sheet object along with 
the amount. Right-click on the straight table sheet object and choose Properties from the 
pop-up menu. In the General tab, give the table a suitable name. In this case, use Sum of 
Accounts. Then move over to the Number tab and choose Money for the number format. 
Click on Apply to immediately apply the number format, and click on OK to close the wizard.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
16
Now our straight table sheet object has easier to read dollar amounts. One of the things we 
notice immediately in our analysis is that we are out of balance by one dollar  
and fifty-nine cents, as shown in the following screenshot:
We can analyze our data just using the list boxes, by selecting a company from the Company 
list and seeing which account groups and which cost centers are included (white) and which 
are excluded (gray). Our selected Company shows highlighted in green:
By selecting Cheyenne Holding, we can see that it is indeed a holding company and has no 
manufacturing groups, sales accounting groups, or cost centers. Also the company  
is in balance. But what about a more graphic visual analysis?

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
17
To create a chart to further visualize and analyze our data, we are going to create a new sheet 
object. This time we are going to create a bar chart so that we can see various company 
contributions to administrative costs or sales by the Acct.5 field, and the account number. 
Just as when we created the company list box, we right-click on the sheet and choose New 
Sheet Object | Chart. This opens the following Chart Properties wizard for us:
We follow the steps through the chart wizard by giving the chart a name, selecting the chart 
type, and the dimensions we want to use. Again our expression is going to be SUM(Amount), 
but we will use the Label option and name it Total Amount in the Expression tab. We have 
selected the Company and Acct.5 dimensions in the Dimension tab, and we take  
the defaults for the rest of the wizard tabs.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
18
When we close the wizard, the new bar chart appears on our sheet, and we can continue 
our analysis. In the following screenshot, we have chosen Cheyenne Manufacturing for our 
Company and all Sales/COS Trade to Mexico Branch as Account Groups. These two selections 
then show us in our straight table the cost centers that are associated with sales/COS trade 
to Mexico branch. In our bar chart, we see the individual accounts associated with sales/COS 
trade to Mexico branch and Cheyenne Manufacturing along with the related amounts posted  
for these accounts.
There's more...
We can modify the load script to load more than one spreadsheet, or to load from a different 
data source so that we have more data to use in our analyses. The Edit Script dialog is 
opened from the File menu or by clicking on the Edit Script symbol in the toolbar as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
19
From the Edit Script interface, we can modify and execute a script that connects the QlikView 
document to an ODBC data source, or to datafiles of different types, thus pulling in the data 
source information. 
Our first script was generated automatically; but scripts can be entered manually, and 
automatically generated scripts can be modified. Complex script statements must, at least 
partially, be entered manually. The statements, expressions, functions, and so on available for 
the creation of scripts are described in the QlikView Help: Script Syntax and Script Expressions.
The Edit Script dialog uses autocomplete, so when typing, the program tries to predict what 
is wanted in the script without your having to type it completely. The predictions include words 
that are part of the script syntax. The script is also color coded by syntax components. The Edit 
Script interface and behavior may be customized by choosing Tools and Editor Preferences. 
At the top of the dialog, a menu bar with various script related commands is found. The most 
frequently used commands also appear in the toolbar. In the toolbar, there is also  
a drop-down list for the tabs of the Edit script wizard as shown in the following screenshot:

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
20
Once we have clicked on the Edit script menu item, we will see the script associated with our 
data load in the interface. The script in the Edit script interface is the automatically generated 
script that was created by the wizard when we started this QlikView file. The automatically 
generated script picked up the column names from the Excel file and put in some default 
formatting scripting. The actual text of the script is as follows:
SET ThousandSep=','; 
SET DecimalSep='.';
SET MoneyThousandSep=',';
SET MoneyDecimalSep='.';

We can change our date formats, month names, day names, our thousands, and our 
decimal separators by changing the automatically generated formats. We can  
copy this part of the script into new blank scripts to get started. The language selection  
that we made during the initial installation of QlikView 11 determines the defaults  
assigned to this portion of the script.

We can add data from multiple sources such as ODBC links, additional Excel "tables," the web, 
FTP, and even other QlikView files. The following screenshot shows the Open Local Files dialog:
The Excel file that we used to create our initial QlikView document is already in our script.  
It happened to be October 2013 data, but suppose we wanted to add November data to our 
analysis? We would just go into the Edit script interface from the File menu and then click  
on the script itself.
Make sure your cursor is at the bottom of the script after the first Excel file path and 
description. If you do not position your cursor where you want your additional script 
information, you may generate your new script code in the middle of your existing script code. 
If you make a mistake, click on Cancel and start over. 
After navigating to the location where we want to add our new code, click on the Table Files 
button. Click on Next through the next four screens unless we need to add column labels  
or transform our data for analysis in some way. The following section is to be added  
to our script:

Once you are done editing the script, click on the OK button. This will save the changes to the 
script. Now, to reload your data, navigate to File | Edit script | Reload. If you receive any error 
messages, the solutions can be researched in the QlikView Help. In this case, QlikView knew we 
were adding data to the same table, hence the layout was the same, and most of the column 
names were the same.
If we look at the straight table and bar chart now, we see that our data has about doubled after 
the reload from two Excel files. But why is that? We thought we were loading the October and 
November data. What is happening here is that we do not have a selection to split the months 
and only select the data for October or November. So, what do we do? Now that we have more 
than one month of data, we can add another list box with the months. Then we can modify our 
chart and straight table sheet objects to separate our monthly data. The following screenshot 
shows how the data doubled after reloading the additional file:

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
23
First we will add a new list box for the months. Right-click on the sheet and select New Sheet 
Object | List Box. In the General tab, we choose the field that was labeled Month in the Excel 
files. Then, we go to the Sort tab and check Sort by Text. Finally, we choose the icons we want 
to appear on the top bar of the list box in the Captions tab.
When we choose OCTOBER or NOVEMBER our straight table sheet object automatically 
shows the correct sum of the accounts. But we notice something else. When we choose 
November our bar chart data disappears. We notice when we go to edit Chart Properties  
of the bar chart sheet object that we have two fields for the five digit account number. The  
one from the October datafile is named Acct.5, and the one for November is named Acct5.  
The following screenshot shows that there are two separate columns from the data loads:

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
24
How do we get QlikView to recognize that both fields are the same? We are going to edit the 
script to automatically link the data.
To automatically link data, navigate to File | Edit Script. We decide that we want the five digit 
account number field to be labeled Acct5 in both cases. While we are at it, we want Acct.6 
and Acct6 to match up and be labeled SubAccount. We do this by manually editing the 
script using standard SQL formats to rename the fields. Our script will now look like this: 
LOAD Company, 
     [Acct-Group], 
     [Account-Name], 
     Count, 
     Acct.5 as Acct5, 
     Acct.6 as SubAccount,

(ooxml, embedded labels, table is LNData);
To save the script, click on OK. We make sure the bar chart sheet object is using the Acct5 
field instead of the now missing Acct.5 field. This can be done by going to Dimensions by 
editing the properties in the Properties tab. Then, using File | Reload, reload to combine 
the data into the newly renamed columns. If the columns are named the same, QlikView 
automatically tries to combine them!

Comments can be added to scripts by using // for a single line or by surrounding the comment 
by a beginning /* and an ending */. The comments show up in green color. Once you click on 
the OK button you will exit the script editor. There is another File menu item that can be used to 
see if QlikView has correctly interpreted the joins. This is the table viewer menu item. You cannot 
edit in the table view, but it is convenient to visualize how the table fields are interacting.

Analyzing retirement locations 
(Intermediate)
In this recipe, we will go through the process of creating our own analysis from scratch in 
order to learn more about combining data from multiple sources. We will discuss how to 
stimulate thought processes in order to select criteria for a creative and meaningful analysis. 
In later sections, we will introduce more sheet objects and more of the QlikView interface will 
be explored. More scripting examples for joining data are covered.
There is an Excel spreadsheet named Where to Retire.xls, which has multiple tabs that 
contain the example data. This sheet is a part of the downloadable support files.
Getting ready
For this analysis, I began by gathering data to load. When my spouse and I first began 
discussing retirement there were many possibilities. What will our needs be in the future?  
My crystal ball is always cloudy, so we just had to make our best guesses about the future.
We are United States citizens and have paid into Medicare. Therefore we would probably want 
to live in the U.S. for medical care. So, we have now narrowed the search to the  
United States without even gathering any data. But, we have to avoid filtering out data before 
we get to analyzing it, or we run the risk of missing important information in our decision-
making process.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
26
Now, I started compiling data from different sources. On the Internet, I found that U.S. 
News, AARP, and Money magazines annually publish top ten lists of best places to retire. 
Some of the lists use specific criteria. The places are often not ranked, but are listed in the 
alphabetical order. Those lists are great if my only criteria matches one of the lists. Defining 
my own criteria and ranking cities accordingly sounds more like the route to take. The Internet 
lists will help contribute cities to investigate. Here are my criteria and how I rank them:
1.	 Family and/or friends who stay close by—use to help select cities to investigate
2.	 Warmer, dryer climate—my husband has asthma
3.	 Low average pollen count/good air quality—we both have allergies
4.	 Lower cost of living than Chicago, where we currently live
5.	 Rich availability of entertainment—especially movies and museums
6.	 Close to hospitals and other well rated health care facilities
7.	
Good water quality and water supply
8.	 Low natural hazard risk—hurricane, tornado, earthquake
This gives me eight criteria to use in evaluating my cities lists.
How to do it…
Grabbing the addresses from my greeting card list, I get 65 unique cities in the US where we 
have been keeping in touch with friends or family. That list gets a 1 in my created column 
"know someone" and goes into an Excel spreadsheet. You may have other criteria and your list 
would differ from mine.
Then I grab a few lists from the Internet and, for demonstration purposes, we will use different 
methods of loading them to QlikView throughout the recipe. If you choose to follow along and 
use the downloaded Excel file, Where to Retire.xls, then all of the datasources in your 
QVW different sheet tabs of the Excel file.
Some examples of the lists I collected are as follows:

The preceding script shows us examples of loading from Excel 2003, 2010 and from comma 
separated value files. Using the Settings menu for the document's settings, we make sure 
that city and state are checked as dimensions. We check the following as measures:


Rank


Quality_of_Life


Climate


Air_Quality


Water_Quality


Entertainment


Friends_and_Family



This helps QlikView know how to treat the data being loaded. The following  
screenshot shows the Document Settings Table tab for Dimension and Measures  
in the Fields section:
Now we can begin the setup of our list box sheet objects to review our data. Create list boxes 
on the Main tab and use it to review and clean up the data and make sure it is  
joining correctly.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
29
In my initial review, I can see that the states are included with the names in some of the data 
and not in others. I need to edit my data to remove the state abbreviation in the city column. 
We also notice that cities are both uppercase and lowercase; therefore they do not necessarily 
match up. We need to convert the City dimension to uppercase. We are doing this in the 
following code when we add a data source:
/* We are loading from Excel 2007. We convert City to upper case 
for the joins. We are assigning the incoming column CleanAir to the 
criteria name Air_Quality */
LOAD Rank, 
     UPPER(City) as City, 
     State, 
     CleanAir as Air_Quality
FROM
C:\TEST\CleanAir.xlsx
(ooxml, embedded labels, table is GoodAir);
We have converted the dimension City to uppercase so that it will match from the various 
load files since we do not have an underlying numeric ID code. Ideally, if the data had been 
available from the multiple sources that way, we could have used zip codes. We have made 
sure that State is the two letter abbreviation. When we want it joined, the Dimension is 
always named State.
Now, we are ready to create some additional sheet objects and sheet tabs to start analyzing 
our data.
To create an analysis interface follow these steps: 
1.	 Start by creating additional sheets by going to the Layout menu and choosing  
Add Sheet. Add one sheet and name it Charts in the Sheet Properties title.  
Then right-click on the main sheet and chose Copy Sheet and name this new  
sheet: Lists. Finally, right-click on each object in the main sheet and chose 
Remove. We could also have moved the list box objects to the Lists sheet  
by copying, then pasting the copied object on to the new Sheet.

2.	 The entry page of the Where to Retire QlikView application is now populated with  
text objects (see the following image). The map from the U.S. Geological Survey 
website is an image inserted into a text object as background. The light blue box is  
a text object with a hyperlink inserted into the formula interface that links to the U.S. 
Geologic Survey website. https://geohazards.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/
cmaps. The house and hands picture behind the title is clip art from Microsoft, 
which is also inserted as a background image. The entry page of the Where to Retire 
QlikView application looks as follows:
3.	 The loaded data is current and does not have a calendar or time designation. 
We want a different method of analyzing this data than one would use to analyze 
financial data. Since it is geographic, it would be nice to analyze the data in a map 
format similar to the U.S. Geologic Survey's Custom Hazard Map in the Main tab. 
QlikView comes to our rescue with QlikView extensions.
4.	 When you installed QlikView, you downloaded several extensions, but to use them, 
they must be unpacked.
Extension objects are located in the C:\Program Files\
QlikView\Examples\Extensions folder for desktop users.
5.	 Navigate to the C:\Program Files\QlikView\Examples\Extensions folder 
and find the Examples.qar extension file (QlikView archive). Double-click to unpack 
it. Once unpacked, you can review the extensions by starting QlikView and navigating 
to the Extension Examples under the QlikView Getting Started examples.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
31
6.	 To actually see the extensions displayed and to work with them, go to the View menu 
in QlikView and switch to the Webview. Here, in the Extension Example application, 
we can see the extension demo examples already created for our use:


Organization chart


Geographic heat map


Bullet chart


Calendar view
7.	
Inspired by the map pictures from the entry page, the Geographic Heat Map 
Extension is useful to visualize the data. Using the extension examples, right-click on 
Geographic Heat Map and see how the properties are handled. For example,  
we can see that the shading of the states is handled by four properties:


A dimension called State


A measure in percent created by the following formula:
Count (DISTINCT [Employee No])/Count (total DISTINCT 
[Employee No])*100 


A color property


The Text1 property: RGB (177, 230, 147) 
Please examine the other extensions and their properties as they may be useful to 
you now that you are aware of them.
8.	 The data that we want to compare in a Geographic Heat Map is not yet loaded, 
except for my personal list of family and friends. We need to include some additional 
information for the map presentations by adding inline loads to the script. In the 
next example of an inline load used to drive extension objects, State is renamed to 
State2. This keeps extension objects independent otherwise the first object State 
selections will exclude the other object selections.
Load * Inline [
Rank, City, State2, High_Pollen, Bad_Air_Quality

8, Low_Natural_Hazard
];
9.	 Now we can create our Geographic Heat Maps for analysis. We need to be in the 
Webview mode to insert an extension sheet object. From the following screenshot, 
we can see that Extension Objects as a menu item now shows at the bottom of  
the New Sheet Object menu when we are in Webview mode.
10.	 To insert the extension sheet object, left-click on the crossed arrows icon next to the 
description and drag and drop on to the sheet. After the Geographical Heat Map (or 
extension sheet object of your choice) appears on the sheet, we can begin to edit the 
Properties menu. 
11.	Right-click on the Name/Menu bar of the extension object to bring up the menu 
and choose Properties. In the Geo Heat Map section of the Properties, we set 
the colors for display. Make sure that Dimension1 is pointing at the correct 
dimension. Recall that to use more than one Geo Heat Map we need different state 
dimensions. Set Measurement1 to a formula for the appropriate measure for the 
map—in this case we are highlighting states that tend to have a high average pollen 
count so we use State2. Choose the highlight color. Text1 controls the shading 
and needs either a RGB web-color coding, a hex code color, or HTML color; words 
such as "blue" or "red" will not work.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
33
12.	Further down in the Properties interface are other web-based properties that can be 
set, including the caption for the extension sheet object.
If you want to know more about the extension sheet objects and even how to create 
your own, there is additional information in the Help menu.
If you have an older 32-bit computer without the ability to use 
more than 2 GB of RAM, the rendering of the Geographic Heat 
Maps will take a long time so you may want to stick to only 
creating one map for your personal version of this recipe.
13.	After inserting and setting up the Geographic Heat Maps into our sheet, the final 
display looks similar to the following screenshot:
How it works...
Now that we have our initial sheet objects created, we can begin to use them for analysis.
The preceding screenshot displays four Geographic Heat Maps. The top-right corner map 
represents states where the Family and Friends list live. Because the data is not easily 
joinable and not based on percentage values, this is the readily available image display that 
makes sense to use for analysis with this data. 

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
34
From the display, we can see that the overlap of the right, lower-right, and lower-left map 
negative qualities only leaves a few states where there are family and friends. Some of the 
states, such as Vermont, Rhode Island, and Delaware, did not get into the Too Cold and 
Snowy lists because of the numerical ranking cutoff. I was surprised that Arizona made  
the list because of the amount of snow that falls in the mountain communities. If it had not, 
I would have had to add another list for the extremely hot areas which would have knocked 
out Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. Texas is already out because of the average pollen count, 
so, for purposes of this analysis, Nevada stays on the list.
Choosing states still on the list that have family and friends, we get California, New Mexico, 
Nevada, and Vermont. Logic says that Vermont is too cold and snowy but Vermont did not 
make the Too Cold and Snowy list cutoff, so we will include it to see if it meets other less 
critical criteria. If I include the states where we don't have family and friends, we can add 
Connecticut, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Rhode Island, and Delaware.
There's more...
Now we can add additional data to analyze. With lists from other websites, government 
studies and magazines, we end up with the following script additions that loads data  
for all my criteria:
When we load from another QlikView file the first line in the script should always be:
//MainScript:
Binary c:\test\cities101.qvw;
Load the example from a SQL Server database table via ODBC. Notice how the names of  
the cities represented by City are converted to uppercase using the keyword UPPER.

When loading from an Excel 2010 file, set a different Rank for a measure. City dimension 
members are converted to uppercase and City is a dimension. State is a dimension.  
City and State are always named the same, they automatically join.
LOAD Rank, 
     UPPER(City) as City,

(html, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, table is @1);
In the How it Works... section, we have refined our state list to 11 states. We will use list boxes 
and multiboxes to further investigate our data. 

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
36
We can search in our list boxes by using the * wild card symbol so that we get Nebraska, 
Nevada, and New Mexico by right-clicking in the State list box, then, we choose Search.  
When the Search textbox pops up, enter NE*.
We add several table boxes and textboxes to analyze our data. The table boxes have  
the Sort option set in the Sort tab, and the Omit Rows Where Field is Null checkbox  
is checked on the Presentation tab.
In order to analyze what we see in the image for adding table boxes and text boxes, we need to 
discuss what we are seeing when we select the states that made our cutoff. Here we see a set 
of table boxes that display the cities and numeric information. Preferably, we want an area with 
a lower cost of living because our income will go down when we retire. The number 100 is the 
median for the Cost of Living index. On the other hand, we want a high score for our Health 
Care index. Also, we need to remember that we have not loaded any scores lower than 80,  
and many of our cities may not have made the 100 index limit.
The Entertainment Rank looks very strange as Las Vegas has a 57 out of 100, and 
our textbox tells us that a rank of 1 is best. Las Vegas may have a lot of entertainment, 
but the ranking we have loaded is based on total number of movie theaters, which was 
my entertainment criteria. Notice also, that San Francisco appears three times on the 
Entertainment list because the original list came by zip code and not by individual city.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
37
We would like to be able to use more list boxes for selection so now we add two more list 
boxes to our sheet, one for Cost of Living index and one for Entertainment. For choosing 
states to examine, we could select the states we want by holding down Ctrl and clicking on the 
states in the upper-left Geographic Heat Map. Because this extension uses state as its driving 
dimension, the selection will carry through to the Lists tab and select the states chosen in the 
State list box.
All QlikView objects are interconnected so that a selection in one object will highlight in white 
the related information in the other objects. 
If we choose cost of living to be below 100—the fourth criteria on my list—in the Cost of Living 
list box by choosing Search and entering <100, we have California, Kansas, Nebraska, New 
Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

Instant QlikView 11 Application Development
38
Now switching back to the possible states and looking at their Entertainment Ranking, we 
have to go to number 57 (which we noticed earlier is Las Vegas) to find an entertainment 
ranking in a state other than California or New Mexico.
To return to a prior selection use the Back button in the toolbar. Once you use the Back 
button, the Forward button will become available to use. QlikView remembers the last  
100 selections.
Next, we select just California and New Mexico and clear all of the other selections by 
clicking on the Entertainment list box, right-clicking and choosing Clear. Then we select 
the Cost of Living index to be below 100. We select these by holding down the Ctrl key and 
clicking on the three values. That leaves us with two cities in California, namely, Bakersfield 
and Farmington, and two cities in New Mexico, namely, Albuquerque and Las Cruces.
Finally, we chose the Near_Friends list box. That narrows the four cities down to one: 
Albuquerque NM. Recall that near friends and family was my most important criteria.
At this point, I would actually continue to investigate all four of the final cities. I might send 
for newspapers and check out other statistics on these four cities on the Internet before 
arranging to visit them and making a final decision. You may want to add and investigate  
the effects of other criteria on the analysis, perhaps your own list of locations of family  
and friends, a different kind of entertainment, or other weather preferences.
In this recipe, we have learned about extensions, toolbar buttons, table boxes, textboxes, 
multiboxes, inserting images, using additional, different data loading sources, how to  
tell QlikView about dimensions and measures, and how one might go about analyzing  
non-financial data.

Using QlikView practically (Intermediate)
In this recipe, we will cover some more of the possibilities for using QlikView 11.
Getting ready
One interesting and practical way in which QlikView has been used is by analyzing the 
hospital prescribing patterns of physicians, hospitals. It has been discovered that they can 
find patterns that might assist them in providing better patient care and to become more 
profitable. The QlikView website offers further information on these areas.
A knowledgeable physician can spot interesting prescribing patterns in hospital data using 
QlikView. Those prescribing patterns might show that a particular physician is prescribing  
an unusual medication for their area of practice. This unusual prescribing pattern needs to be 
investigated. Among the possibilities that this prescribing pattern might indicate are:
f
f
The physician is confused about the usage of this medication and may be putting  
the hospital at risk.
f
f
The physician is treating a condition outside of his/her specialization area such 
as when a patient, that is seeing the physician for a complaint in the physician's 
specialization area, also presents with bronchitis or flu symptoms.
f
f
The physician has noticed that a medication indicated for one condition such  
as an anti-inflammatory for arthritis seems to also reduce inflammation related  
to certain types of skin rash, the physician's specialty. In which case, we need 
to work with the physician to get this observation back to the pharmaceutical 
company so that the drug can be put into drug trials for this usage.

It is important with this type of information that knowledgeable people have the opportunity 
to review the potential patterns and discuss the possible implications of those patterns.

reports using QlikView for analyzing both prescribing patterns and managing profitability. 
QlikView can make it easier to see those patterns that help manage health care areas such 
as patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
Another area where QlikView has been used is crime solving in Sweden.
On the QlikView website is the Amazing Tales of Business Discovery: The Tale of the Killer 
Clues video (http://www.qlikview.com/us/videos/how-to/tales-of-business-
discovery/bd-killers-clues). In this video, QlikView's head of products, Donald 
Farmer, relates how the police in southern Sweden used QlikView to analyze their criminal 
archive. Through this analysis they were able to discover patterns and connections in 
criminal activities that helped them to track down a serial killer before he could strike again. 
Simonsson, a police analyst from Malmö, Sweden, estimated that, without QlikView,  
analyzing the entire set of data could have taken 43 years for one detective.

Don't forget that there are many more QlikView demo examples to explore, both from the 
website and from links under the Examples section in your own personal QlikView application.
Demos that we have not explored, available under the Examples section in your own personal 
QlikView application will include: 
f
f
Data Visualization: Here you can see the various kinds of charts available, along 
with advice on when to use them. You can copy and paste the sheet objects from 
this application into your own QlikView and then modify the settings to fit your own 
application needs.
f
f
Executive Dashboard: This is an example of an application that supports key 
performance indicators with the ability to investigate the underlying details. This 
example can be used as a personal sales tool to excite your employer about the 
possibilities with QlikView.
f
f
Golf Quest: If you enjoy playing golf, this application can help you pick your next 
vacation location.
f
f
Sales Compass: Another traditional business type application of QlikView for use by a 
company's sales force.
f
f
QlikView Developer Toolkit: Examples of all the non-web sheet objects that can be 
copied and used in new applications. Additional tabs contain Theme examples and 
Design Elements such as column overlays, that will help create professional visual 
interfaces for your sheets.
f
f
What's New in QlikView: This final QlikView example is linked directly in your personal 
application. The various tabs demonstrate objects and properties such as the Pick  
lists, the Container object, mouse over pop-up information, the Global Search tool, 
comparative analysis, conditional enabling of dimensions and expressions, and more 
granular chart control using Global Grouping.
How it works...
This last new feature, Global Grouping, could have been used in the Analyzing retirement 
locations recipe's example QlikView application. In the example on the Sales Reps tab, a 
variable called vTopN is used in a text-input box to collect the limit, then, the grouping control 
of the chart object properties uses the following formula to pass the variable input and sort 
the chart accordingly:
rank(sum(aggr(sum(Sales), GetCurrentField([@TopX]), [Sales Rep 
Name])))

In addition to the functioning demos that you can investigate, there are numerous white 
papers that you can download, webinars that you can attend or play on-demand, and videos 
that you can view. The login ID that you created when you downloaded your personal QlikView 
application also gives you access to these.
When you are getting started, it is well worth the time it takes to play the QlikView Product 
Tour video.
The Resource Library is where you will find the many white papers available for downloading 
and online-reading (http://www.qlikview.com/us/explore/resources).

In the Training section, you will find Free Training, Recommended Courses, and information 
about QlikView Certification when you are ready. There are QlikView 11 certification exams 
available for designer, developer, and system administrator. With all of these resources 
at your fingertips, you can quickly become an expert in QlikView development, or become 
instrumental in helping your company quickly realize the benefits of QlikView applications.
The free-to-download QlikView tutorial (scroll to the bottom of the Training page) available in 
this area will walk you through using the application, adding design elements, and loading 
data to an existing application. The tutorial is a self-contained zipped file. It is divided into 
three sections after the introduction: Working with QlikView, Creating a document, and 
Advanced features. The tutorial is designed to allow you to stop at the point you have gathered 
enough information to meet your QlikView needs.
Here are five points of interest that are covered in the tutorial:
f
f
How to change the display order from columns to rows: Deselect Single Column in 
the Presentation tab in the list box's Properties.
f
f
Each sheet object can have its size changed by dragging with the mouse pointer. 
There are options on the Layout tab of the Properties section that control or lock 
down the sheet object.
f
f
"Painting" the area of a chart to select the values associated with that area: Click in 
the chart and drag the cursor.
f
f
Create a Detached chart that will not be updated when selections are made by 
right-clicking in an existing chart and choosing clone, then right-click in the Cloned 
chart and choose Detach.
f
f
To display calculated data for several dimensions at once, create a Pivot Table object 
by right-clicking in the sheet, selecting chart from the menu, then checking the box 
for Chart Type as Pivot Table.
One final thing to remember when creating and using your QlikView applications is the very 
old (1963) mantra of computer science, garbage in – garbage out. Computers and QlikView 
applications will unquestioningly process the most nonsensical data.
The intelligence in business intelligence has to come from you — the 
application user!
Nothing can replace your own expertise and common sense applied to the data. QlikView can 
make it easier for you to analyze data and share discoveries, and to quickly see outliers, but 
the final arbitrator of action based on the analysis has to have the human beings involved.

Sharing the wealth (of information) –  
scaling up (Intermediate)
This final recipe discusses scaling up to an Enterprise application with information on 
Licensing, Enterprise Servers, Data Sources, Mobile Applications and QlikCommunity.
Perhaps you are the CFO of a company and, after downloading and investigating QlikView 
11; you have decided this is a tool that can really benefit your company. Or maybe you are 
the warehouse manager, an accounting analyst, or a sales manager and you heard about 
QlikView from a friend.  Now that you know what QlikView can do, you have recommended  
it to upper management. They have asked you, "What will it take? How do we make QlikView 
available for collaborative analysis in our company?" Scale up to an Enterprise application. 
Getting ready
Recall that the very first page when you open QlikView contains the license information about 
the personal edition of QlikView. For you to open QlikView documents created by someone 
else, such as the Analyzing retirement locations recipe, we would both need licenses. I would 
need a license so that the document could be saved for more than personal use, and you 
would need one to open a QlikView document (.qvw) created by someone else.
Licenses are available for named users or as concurrent user licenses. Each QlikView 
licensed user has a fully functioning version of QlikView. When evaluating the cost of business 
intelligence software, the actual licensing costs are usually a small piece of the return on 
investment calculation. QlikView is designed to help eliminate some of those extra costs of 
services often necessary with other business intelligence software by helping you become 
your own developer.

Current pricing is available from the QlikView website. This is a good place to start when 
thinking about implementing an enterprise version of the software. This pricing information 
also includes information on:

intranet firewall
f
f

and managing metadata such as dimension and formula consistency

How to do it…
The first step to scaling up is obtaining the Enterprise licensing. Contact the QlikView Sales 
Department when you are ready for more information (http://www.qlikview.com/us/
explore/pricing).
The next step to scaling up and sharing your information is setting up Enterprise Servers. 
QlikView is not a non-profit foundation, but a business, and it needs to make its profits from 
somewhere. QlikView is expecting that you will love the product and will recommend it to your 
company. The pricing model for Enterprise licensing is comparatively reasonable, but you must 
remember to factor in the initial install and set up services that come with any new enterprise 
level application. For this, QlikView offers their QlikView expert services with the Foundation 
services offering (http://www.qlikview.com/us/services/expert-services/
foundation-services). 
Foundation services engagement will cover:
f
f
System Architecture Foundation
f
f
Data Architecture Foundation
f
f
Application Architecture Foundation
f
f
Solution Validation
Connecting to an Enterprise Server is done via the Open in Server command on the File 
menu, or from the Open in Server tab on the Start page.
How it works...
Additional considerations when scaling up to an Enterprise Server, include security, 
deployment, and understanding of the technology.
This is not necessarily something that you need to understand in depth unless you are a 
technology person actually setting up the enterprise application, but knowing a little bit about 
these aspects of the application can help you guide your managers and associates in making 
the decision to scale up to an enterprise application.

When more than one person is using the application and has access to data, security of data 
becomes an issue. QlikView security can be integrated with Microsoft Active Directory, with 
Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and with third-party security (which requires QlikView 
Server Enterprise Edition).
To manage large deployments of QlikView, use the QlikView Publisher component which is an 
administrative interface for maintaining QlikView analyses. QlikView Publisher enables reload 
of data to a QlikView analysis on a periodic basis to ensure that the most current data is 
available. QlikView Publisher connects to the security directory servers within your organization 
and applies the user security rules to the QlikView analysis to ensure appropriate secure user 
access. QlikView Publisher is licensed on a per server basis and includes a separately licensable 
option for PDF report distribution capabilities.
QlikView is an in-memory BI pioneer using an inference engine that maintains associations 
in the data (which we have seen in previous recipes where, when giving data from different 
sources the same name, QlikView knows that we intend the data to be joined as one 
dimension). Aggregations are calculated as needed for use by multiple people. QlikView caches 
data in memory and uses proprietary technology to compress the data down to as much as 10 
percent of its original size. This helps to optimize the power of the computer processor(s) for the 
fastest user experience possible.
Additionally, the QlikView Server component supports concurrent access to analyses by large 
user groups. QlikView Server is designed to maximize the use of the processing power of 
standard multicore servers by spreading calculations over all of the available CPU cores. The 
QlikView Server can be deployed across more than one physical server into clusters to provide 
fault tolerance and additional scale.
For large enterprise deployments, multiple QlikView Servers and QlikView Publishers can be 
clustered to provide load balancing and fail-over capabilities.
QlikView Publisher, QlikView web parts for Microsoft SharePoint®, and QlikView Workbench 
are additional licensed modules of QlikView Server. QlikView web parts for Microsoft 
SharePoint® and QlikView Workbench require QlikView Server Enterprise Edition. Install 
them by purchasing and applying a license to a QlikView Server. QlikView recommends that 
QlikView Server and Publisher reside on separate, dedicated server machines with no other 
applications running, for optimal performance of a QlikView deployment.
There's more...
With QlikView 11, Source Control Integration was introduced. This is the capability for 
developers of QlikView documents to manage their work with source control tools. With 
these tools, developers can control and share their development efforts in a single  
QlikView QVW file.

Instant QlikView11 Application Development
47
This feature is available when using QlikView desktop. A Menu option in the File menu 
allows QlikView developers to connect a QlikView document to a source-control system. 
More information on source control is available in a white paper at http://community.
qlikview.com.
For more details on server requirements, check out the PDF document: 
DS-QlikView-11-System-Requirements-EN.pdf available from the 
QlikView website.
QlikView can connect to Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and eXtensible Markup 
Language (XML) data sources, as well as to Microsoft Excel. Developers can use the open 
QVX (QlikView data exchange) format for importing non-standard data sources into QlikView. 
When you purchase an Enterprise Server license, in addition to the sources you could already 
connect to, you will receive connectors for non-ODBC data sources SalesForce.com and 
Informatica. There is an additional charge for the SAP NetWeaver® connector.
Documents published on a QlikView Server can be accessed by different clients including the 
Internet Explorer plugin, AJAX Zero Footprint, and several mobile clients such as iPhone, iPad, 
Android, and Blackberry.
It is now possible to distribute a QVW file to the e-mail recipients 
defined in a field in the document. See QlikCommunity for tested 
devices and version details.
On mobile devices, Users get a complete QlikView experience with interactive analysis and 
rich visualization. The mobile application is free to download and works with any QlikView 11 
Server license. Important features are:
f
f
Delivery of the full QlikView Business Discovery experience across desktop, laptop, 
and mobile platforms

f

Perhaps one of the most important (and free) QlikView website features is the QlikCommunity.
QlikCommunity is a discussion forum for QlikView users: http://community.qlikview.
com. Log in with your QlikView ID, the same one you used to download QlikView Personal 
Edition. Here you will be able to set up your personal profile, join groups, ask questions, read 
blogs, and make suggestions for improvements to QlikView functionality. The search function 
in the QlikCommunity website works well. Chances are, if you are just starting out, you are not 
the only one to have ever run into the issue that you are facing.
Enjoy your journey with QlikView!
