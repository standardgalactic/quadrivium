Introduction
W
elcome to Quality Control For Dummies, the book that helps anyone
unfamiliar with quality control find their way around a quality pro-
gram. Quality improvement techniques have been around for a very long
time. They apply to every type of endeavor — business (most likely why
you’re here), educational (the reason you may have taken those test-taking
courses or joined study groups), and even personal (self-help books, anyone?).
We all want to do things faster and for less cost while getting more desirable
results. A company’s quality system strives for the same goals: better, faster,
and cheaper. With this book, you’ll be able to understand the various and ever-
changing quality initiatives underway or under discussion at your company.
About This Book
Most quality control books have a single theme: They push their own theory
as the “one right way” to solve all of a company’s problems. But this book
isn’t like that. It addresses every major quality improvement program and
describes how to choose the applicable parts for a company.
The design of this book allows you to pick it up and begin reading at any
point — much like a reference book — so we suggest you start with a topic
that interests you. You can use the table of contents to identify general areas
of interest or broad topics. You’ll come to find, however, that the index is
your best friend for identifying detailed concepts, related topics, or particu-
lar quality issues. After you find what you need, you can toss the book on a
shelf on your way out the door and tackle whatever tasks you set for yourself
with confidence — and without wading through unrelated details.
Conventions Used in This Book
To guide you through this book, we include the following conventions:
 Italics point out defined terms and emphasize certain words.
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted lists and actions to take in
numbered lists.
 Monofont highlights Web addresses.

During printing of this book, some Web addresses may have broken across
two lines of text. If you come across a Web address spread over two lines,
rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to
indicate the break. Just type in exactly what you see, pretending as though
the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
You can safely skip any text that we mark with the Technical Stuff icon; the
information is interesting, to be sure, but it’s not essential to your under-
standing of quality issues. You can also skip sidebars (those shaded gray
boxes within the chapters); we like the stories in them, but we won’t be
offended if you don’t read them.
Foolish Assumptions
We don’t think that anything in this book is foolish, but we have made the fol-
lowing assumptions about our readers:
 You’re a business owner or CEO who needs to know more about quality
and the right quality methods for your organization.
 You’re a staff member or mid-level manager who’s in charge of introduc-
ing quality methods to your organization.
 You’re a team leader looking for ideas on improving how a team works to
reduce costs and improve service.
 You’re an average worker trying to figure out what all the funny names
for the different quality techniques really mean.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into the following five parts, each of which has several
chapters. Each chapter discusses a major topic related to quality control,
and we divide the chapters into sections, which discuss particular issues
related to those topics. The book is organized to support both a linear and
modular read, but how you read it is up to you. Choose a part, a chapter, or a
related topic — whatever floats your boat — and start reading!

Quality Control For Dummies 

Part I: Understanding the 
Basics of Quality Control
Part I reviews the basic concept of “quality” and how it fits into an organiza-
tion’s products, services, and strategies. We provide an overview of what
quality really means, why it’s important in the modern business world, and
the standards used to govern it. We also cover quality assurance, which
examines the tools used to create a product or service, and inspection, which
examines the results of a process to determine the degree to which it con-
forms to what it’s supposed to be.
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality
Control Methods to Use
In Part II, we explore some fundamental processes for improving quality. For
example, we explain how the customer defines quality with what’s called the
voice of the customer. We also explore ways to measure and evaluate quality
characteristics, such as Statistical Process Control (not as scary as it
sounds).
Part III: Whipping Quality Control 
into Shape with Lean Processes
Part III provides you with an explanation of the various Lean techniques in
order to show how they build on one another. A Lean organization has exam-
ined all its processes and has squeezed out all the waste by cleaning up the
workplace. Identifying waste and squeezing it out of your processes provides
many savings, because a big money sink in many companies is an excess-
materials inventory. Eliminating this bloat saves money and improves quality
all around. Let us show you how!
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality 
Control Techniques
Part IV looks at some of the better-known quality methodologies that have
been in fashion recently. Interestingly enough, the methods we outline here

Introduction

seem to use varying amounts of the Lean tools we identify in Part III — they
just add their own spins on how to use them. And as you’re probably aware,
all “expert” consultants have their own spins on things because that’s how
they justify their fat salaries.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V follows in the grand tradition of For Dummies books providing Parts of
Tens. Here you find ten steps for incorporating quality into a new process
and ten Web sites that give you some quality control tips and present some
quality techniques. This supplemental information is designed to be both
helpful and informative.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons used in this book point you to important (and not so important)

Part I
Understanding the
Basics of Quality
Control

In this part . . .
Quality control is a term often used to cover the entire
concept of product quality. Every businessperson
has a unique idea of what a “quality” product should be.
In this part, we explore the basics of what makes up qual-
ity along with examples of how you can apply it.
We cover quality standards, which are like “the rules of
the road.” If every employee understands and follows
them, every employee knows what to expect. We also dis-
cuss quality assurance, which examines the materials you
use to create a product or service. “Good cakes require
good ingredients,” and so do good business products.
To wrap up the first part, we explain how quality control
examines the results of a process to determine the degree
to which it conforms to expectations. In many companies,
this process is the “final inspection” to ensure that they
pass on only good results to customers. However, catch-
ing poor quality means that you’ve already wasted the
money making a product that isn’t ready for sale. The
ideal situation is to prevent an error from ever occurring.

W
elcome! Because you’re reading this book, you’ve probably
 Been asked to lead a quality control initiative.
 Been assigned to a quality team.
 Heard your company CEO say quality is job #1.
 Heard rumors about new quality programs at your company.
Of course, you may simply be curious about the topic of quality control, and
you want to discover more about how quality control affects your company
and your job. We commend your dedication and initiative!
Quality control is a critical concept in every industry and profession. As glob-
alization continues and the world becomes smaller, making it possible for
consumers to pick and choose from the best products worldwide, the sur-
vival of your job and of your company depends on your ability to produce a
quality product or service. In this chapter, we define the term “quality,” and
we introduce some important quality control concepts and methods.

Looking at Different Definitions 
of “Quality”
Everyone says that they want quality products or services, or a high level of
quality, but what do they really mean? Is it possible to have too much qual-
ity? Without a clear definition of quality, you can’t even begin to measure and
evaluate it. In the following sections, we define quality in customer-oriented
and statistical terms.
A customer-based definition of quality
What does the word quality mean to you? For most people, quality is associ-
ated with the idea of a product or service that’s well done, looks good, and
does its job well. We think of a quality product as one that lasts, holds up well
under use, and doesn’t require constant repair. A quality product or service
should meet a high standard in many areas, such as form, features, fit and
finish, reliability, and usability.
Most people use the word quality to mean “having a high degree of excel-
lence,” but like beauty, quality is in the eye of the beholder. If a consumer’s
desire is to have basic transportation at a low price, he would buy a Toyota
rather than a Lexus. The Toyota may be a lesser grade of car, but is it of
lower quality than the Lexus? That’s up to the consumer to decide.
To complicate matters, the definition of quality changes over time. The Ford
Model T was once thought of as a quality product, but if a dealership sold it
today, it would be in the same quality class as the Yugo. Consumers’ quality
standards for cars have changed over time, just like they have for other prod-
ucts. As products and services evolve, consumer expectations tend to increase
so that yesterday’s quality product becomes tomorrow’s junk.
What do these facts mean to your business? Quality, in the eyes of a busi-
ness, revolves around meeting customer expectations — expectations that
may be stated or implied. One action that sums up quality from a business
perspective is when the customer returns after the sale and the product
doesn’t. Repeat business is probably the most basic measure of quality,
because customers vote on the quality of your product or service with their
pocketbooks. But unlike political elections, your customers vote daily, and
new opposing candidates appear just as often to try to win your customers’
votes.
10
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

The statistical definition of quality
As you may expect, the statistical definition of quality is a little more precise
than other definitions, such as the customer-based concept, and is based on
mathematics. When you measure quality statistically, you look for variation
in a measurement between what the customer asks for and what you pro-
duce. The less variation you have, the higher the quality of your product or
service.
All processes have some natural variation; you use statistics to detect abnor-
mal variation that could cause you to produce a bad product or service. You
can also use statistics to avoid testing every item that you produce. By test-
ing a sample of what you make or deliver, you can use statistics to measure
its quality and find out whether it meets customer requirements.
Setting Quality Standards
After you as an organization decide on a definition of quality (see the previ-
ous section), you need standards against which to measure your quality.
Why? Many standards are driven by the desire to safeguard the health and
well-being of the people who use the products or services companies pro-
vide. Quality standards also are critical in support of international trade.
Almost every industry has an association or trade group that sets quality
standards against which companies can measure the quality of their prod-
ucts or services. Industries also have their own government- or business-
supported standards bodies for products important to them. The International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international body made up of
the national standards organizations for almost every country. We cover 
standards in detail in Chapter 2.
Preventing Errors with Quality Assurance
Quality assurance focuses on the ability of a process to produce or deliver a
quality product or service. This method differs from quality control in that 
it looks at the entire process, not just the final product. Quality control is
designed to detect problems with a product or service (see the next section);
quality assurance attempts to head off problems at the pass by tweaking a
production process until it can produce a quality product.
11
Chapter 1: Defining and Explaining Quality Control

Don’t get us wrong; we’re not saying that quality assurance and quality con-
trol are unrelated. By continually improving your process, you improve the
quality of your product or service. Probably the most well-known technique
for improving a process is called the Plan-Do-Check-Act, or the PDCA Cycle.
This simple but powerful tool requires you to
 Plan improvements to your process by looking for problems that affect
the quality of your product or service.
 Make improvements by implementing small changes to minimize disrup-
tion to your process.
 Check production results to see if you’ve actually made an improvement.
 Act on what you discover and roll it out to the entire process.
Check out Chapter 3 for more information about quality assurance concepts.
Controlling Quality with Inspection
The most basic quality control technique is to inspect the results of your pro-
duction or service-delivery process to make sure it conforms to customer
requirements. In quality control terms, conforming means that an item meets
customer specifications, and nonconforming means it doesn’t. You inspect
your product or service by measuring one or more of its properties and com-
paring the measurements to customer specifications.
Although inspection can ensure that 100 percent of the products or services
you deliver to your customers are good, it can be a very expensive process,
especially for high-volume, low-value items (such as common nails or shirt
buttons). Also, inspection is impossible for items where testing can damage
the product (such as testing a bullet).
Head to Chapter 4 for details about the role of inspection in quality control.
We explain the challenges of inspection, how to overcome the challenges,
and how to choose the best inspection method for your organization.
Applying Fundamental Quality 
Control Concepts
Your organization can implement several fundamental quality control processes
to ensure that you produce or deliver a high-quality product or service. The
following sections present the information you need to determine how you
can integrate quality control processes into your organization.
12
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

Introducing quality control 
to your business
The introduction of a quality control process into an organization can be a
major shock to its system. The following components are crucial if you want
to lessen the shock and gain acceptance within your organization:
 Advertise acceptance of the program from important stakeholders
within your organization.
 Give communication power to a sponsor who can articulate the need for
change and who has the political power to gain compliance when required.
 Communicate the reasons for the change and the benefits it will bring to
everyone in the organization.
 Train employees in the new ways of the organization. You want workers
doing the right things consistently because success helps to gain support.
Like most other changes, quality control is best introduced in small bits. One
way to do this is to create a pilot project that allows you to make a small
change to a small part of your process to see the change’s effect. If the results
are good, you can implement the change on a wider basis; if the change is bad,
you’ve limited the damage done. See Chapter 5 for the scoop on successfully
introducing quality methods to your company.
Listening to your customers
An important concept in quality control is listening to the customer; we call
this listening to the voice of the customer (the VOC). Although this task seems
pretty simple (can’t you just ask?!), you may find that your customers don’t
know exactly what they need, or they can’t articulate their needs. The cus-
tomer typically has three desires:
 They want it good.
 They want it fast.
 They want it cheap.
Of course, in the real world, consumers seldom get all three, so you need to
identify what’s most important in your customers’ buying decisions, and you
need to make sure you satisfy those needs.
You have several ways to hear the VOC:
 You can ask by handing out questionnaires, conducting interviews,
reviewing complaints, holding focus groups, reviewing purchasing pat-
terns, and interviewing field personnel.
13
Chapter 1: Defining and Explaining Quality Control

 You can borrow good ideas from your competitors. Don’t be afraid to
use good ideas, no matter where you find them.
 You can use a good customer relationship management (CRM) system,
which is a handy tool for gathering and analyzing data about customers.
Chapter 6 has details on listening to the VOC to improve the quality of your
product or service.
Measuring your quality
The old management saying “You can’t manage what you can’t measure”
rings especially true in quality control. A good measurement system helps
you to know where you’ve been and where you’re going. Customers typically
require that you measure certain attributes of your product or service against
their specifications. Your job is to determine what to measure, how to mea-
sure it, and when to measure it.
Employee training is critical to ensure that everyone involved in your
process measures the same specifications in the same way. You also need to
collect data in a usable format so that you can analyze it to determine the
effectiveness of your quality process. The effectiveness of your quality
process is directly related to the quality of your data collection and analysis
process. If you don’t have good data, you can’t make good decisions.
Check out Chapters 7 and 8 for the nitty-gritty on measuring your current
quality process.
Evaluating your quality
The most common way to analyze the data you collect is to use statistics.
Statistics serve many purposes within quality control:
 Statistics allow you to determine which processes or parts of processes
are causing your company the most problems (by using the 80/20 rule —
80 percent of your problems are caused by 20 percent of what you do).
 You can use statistics for sampling so that you don’t have to test 100
percent of the items you make.
 Statistics can help you spot relationships between the values you 
measure — even if the relationships aren’t obvious. They also allow you
to identify small variations in your process that can lead to big problems
if you don’t correct them.
Although statistics can seem daunting, you can use many simple tools to
greatly improve your quality — tools that don’t require an advanced degree
14
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

in statistics! Chapter 9 has all the information you need to evaluate your qual-
ity process with simple statistical tools.
Although much of statistics allows you to look back only at what has hap-
pened in the past, Statistical Process Control (SPC) allows you to identify
problems before they can negatively impact the quality of your product 
or service. The basic idea behind SPC is that if you can spot a change in 
a process before it gets to the point of making bad products, you can fix the
process before bad products hit the shelves. We cover SPC in Chapter 10.
Trimming Down with Lean Processes
Lean processes are the latest diet craze in the world of quality control! Lean
is a quality control technique you can use to identify and eliminate the flab in
your company’s processes. The “flab” is all the dead weight carried by a
process without adding any value. The customer doesn’t want to pay for
dead weight, so why should you?
Most company processes are wasteful in terms of time and materials, which
often results in poorer quality to the customer — a concern for all businesses.
Lean focuses on customer satisfaction and cost reduction. Proponents of the
technique believe that every step in a process is an opportunity to make a
mistake — to create a quality problem, in other words. The fewer steps you
have in a process, the fewer chances for error you create and the better the
quality in your final product or service.
You can apply the Lean techniques in the following sections to all types of
processes and in environments ranging from offices, to hospitals, to factories.
In most cases, applying Lean concepts doesn’t require an increase in capital
costs — it simply reassigns people to more productive purposes. And, oh
yes, Lean processes are much cheaper to operate. For a greater overview of
Lean processes, check out Chapter 11.
Value Stream Mapping
People think in images, not in words, so giving them a picture of how some-
thing is done is often better than telling them about a process. After all, the
quote is “Show me the money!” not “Tell me about the money!”
Value Stream Mapping (see Chapter 12) visually describes a production
process in order to help workers locate waste within it. Waste is any activity
that doesn’t add value for the customer. Typically, eliminating waste involves
reducing the amount of inventory sitting around and shortening the time it
takes to deliver a product or service to the customer upon its order.
15
Chapter 1: Defining and Explaining Quality Control

The 5S method
Work areas evolve along with the processes they support. As your organiza-
tion implements new actions and tools, you must find a place for them
“somewhere.” Over time, clutter can slowly build as piles of excess materials
or tools grow and gradually gum up the smooth flow of work.
The 5S method is an essential tool for any quality initiative that seeks to clear
up the flow of work. Five Ss describe five Japanese attributes required for a
clean workplace:
 Seiri (organization)
 Seiton (neatness)
 Seiso (cleaning)
 Seiketsu (standardization)
 Shitsuke (discipline)
Removing all the clutter from a process eliminates hidden inventories, frees
floor space for productive use, improves the flow of materials through the
workplace, reduces walk time, and shakes out unnecessary items for reuse
elsewhere or landfill designation. Head to Chapter 13 for details about 5S.
Rapid Improvement Events
No one knows a process like the workers who touch it every day. They know
how the work should flow, they can identify obstacles that slow everyone
down, and they deal with problems that never seem to go away. So, why not
tap this source of institutional knowledge and turn it loose to fix the prob-
lems that vex workers day in and day out?
A Rapid Improvement Event (RIE), which we discuss in Chapter 14, is an inten-
sive process-improvement activity, where over a few days a company’s workers
bone up on Lean techniques and rebuild their processes to incorporate its prin-
ciples. The workers take apart their work areas, rearrange items, and reassemble
the spaces for more efficient work. The improvements are immediate, and the
workers have ownership of the process and feel motivated to further refine it.
Lean Materials and Kanban
A company’s materials are essential for the organization to work well, but
they also tie up a large part of a company’s capital. And while the company
does its business year in and year out, its materials are stolen, damaged, rot-
ting, corroding, and losing value in many other ways.
16
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

A key part of the Lean approach is to minimize the amount of materials (both
incoming and finished goods) you have sitting around in your facility. (What
do you know? This minimization is called Lean Materials.) Excess materials
hide problems with purchasing, work scheduling, scrap rates, and so on.
Eliminating these excess materials provides an immediate financial benefit to
your company — if you eliminate correctly.
You don’t want to eliminate so thoroughly that you cause shortages. One
method you can use to fix the problem of excess materials without causing
shortages is Kanban. Kanban is a materials system controlled by the cus-
tomer. When a consumer buys an item, action cascades back up the produc-
tion line to make one more of that item.
Turn to Chapter 15 for more information about Lean Materials and Kanban.
Checking Out Additional Quality 
Control Techniques
Okay, so Lean is interesting (see the previous section), but what other quality
control techniques are available? Other quality methodologies have recently
come into fashion, and we cover a few big ones in the following sections.
They borrow from previous quality schools but provide their own twists that
make it easier to accommodate different environments.
Total Quality Management
Total Quality Management (TQM), which we cover in Chapter 16, combines
the work of important quality leaders, such as W. Edwards Deming, Joseph
Juran, and Phillip Crosby, into a single quality improvement approach. You
use TQM to improve the performance of processes by controlling variation —
especially if your organization’s products don’t change frequently. TQM is
very flexible and suitable to all types of organizations. It promotes a “quality
culture,” where a company trains everyone to focus on continuously improv-
ing the quality of everything the organization does. The concept includes the
publication of a “quality strategy,” whose application workers discuss at
every meeting. It also requires the creation and use of quality measurement
and monitoring tools.
Six Sigma
Six Sigma (see Chapter 17) is a great tool for driving difficult process problems
back to their root causes. It uses process-analysis techniques and a broad
17
Chapter 1: Defining and Explaining Quality Control

application of statistics to determine the process inputs that cause the unde-
sired outputs. Minimizing the variation of inputs produces a more consistent
product or service.
Six Sigma is designed to provide “breakthrough” results, whereas the results
from Lean improvements are bit by bit. Six Sigma is the best tool for fixing
stubborn, it’s-always-been-this-way problems. However, it isn’t the right tool
for every difficult situation. Six Sigma techniques take time to work their
magic. You should apply it only after other quality techniques, such as Lean,
have removed the waste and clutter from your process.
Quality Function Deployment
Quality, as we note in the earlier section “A customer-based definition of
quality,” is how well a product’s or service’s characteristics fulfill customer
needs and wants. Quality Function Deployment (QFD), which we cover in
Chapter 18, is a disciplined approach to identifying customer needs and
wants and translating them into product or service characteristics. Its tech-
nique is easy to understand but time consuming to implement.
Many businesses like the structured way that QFD breaks down customer
requirements into various components. When complete, QFD assembles the
information into a busy matrix called the House of Quality.
QFD’s power is in improving cross-functional communication and decision-
making within an organization. It focuses all workers on the true require-
ments of the customer and minimizes misinterpretation of customer needs.
The Theory of Constraints
Every company has goals it wants to achieve, usually tied directly to revenue.
Company goals are the result of a chain of activities or processes. However,
each chain has a weak link that limits how much it can produce — a limitation
known as its constraint. The pace at which a chain produces is its drum (or
drumbeat). In order to achieve company goals, you need to increase your
drumbeat in order to increase overall process throughput.
The Theory of Constraints (see Chapter 19 for details) is a comprehensive tech-
nique for identifying and managing an organization’s constraints for obtaining
maximum throughput. In short, with this concept, you find the constraint,
focus it on maximum throughout by eliminating its distractions, and only
then, if required, expand it by hiring more workers or putting in more
machinery. In many cases, a company’s own policies and metrics are its
worst enemies (even though they’re so cheap to fix).

Understanding the Importance 
of Quality Standards
In This Chapter
 Securing the right level of “quality”
 Discovering how quality standards work
 Checking out the roles of quality standards in commerce
 Proving to the world that you run a quality organization
I
magine trying to build a house with pieces of lumber that measure at dif-
ferent sizes, depending on where you buy them, or working on a car made
with bolts that vary by manufacturer. Without quality standards, these tasks
are much harder than they need to be. Quality standards ensure that the
wood you purchase is the same no matter what lumberyard you buy it from.
Standards also make it possible to buy one set of wrenches to work on all
your cars. In a general sense, quality standards make it possible for compa-
nies across the globe to trade with each other. You should have confidence
that the products you buy will mesh with the products you build.
In this chapter, you discover how quality standards make the modern world
of global trade possible. You find out what level of quality is right for your
company. You set the quality standards that will govern your production. You
examine the role of quality in the global marketplace. Finally, you find out
how ISO certification enters the quality picture.
Getting the Quality Just Right
As a child, you probably heard the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
Just as Goldilocks wants the soup, the chair, and the bed to be “just right,”
your customers want something that fits their needs.

You measure quality by how well a product or service conforms to the cus-
tomer’s desired specifications. (Chapter 6 has details on detecting the voice
of the customer in quality issues.) Quality isn’t a statement of the value of a
product. Although one bear’s soup is too hot for Goldilocks, and one bear’s
soup is too cold, the food is all high-quality soup for the intended diners.
Goldilocks finds the teeny, tiny bear’s soup to be “just right” because she
happens to share the same taste in soup as that bear, not because that bear’s
soup is any “better” than the others.
In the following sections, we explain the costs of not meeting your customers’
expectations (and why exceeding them can sometimes be bad).
Falling short: The cost of offering too little
The idea that insufficient value is bad is easy for everyone to understand. If I
ask for a ladder that holds 300 pounds (I’m a big guy!), and the ladder you
sell me holds only 250 pounds, I’m going to have a problem with the quality
of your ladder. I will incur a cost (a medical cost!) that you created because
you sold me, in my opinion, a ladder of poor quality.
The impact of providing too little quality is such an important concept in the
field of quality control that it has a formal name: cost of poor quality, or COPQ.
COPQ consists of all the costs that result from producing a poor-quality prod-
uct or service. This expense consists of the costs of
 Improving the actual product or service to fill the gap between what the
customer wants and what you currently offer
 Materials you added to the product or work you put into the service
before the customer rejected it
 Lost labor and resources you need to fix the poor-quality product
 Potential lost market share (you may lose orders to competitors that
offer better quality)
 Getting rid of the poor-quality product rejected by a customer (because
you can’t resell it)
COPQ doesn’t include any costs associated with attempting to detect or pre-
vent the lack of quality.
Calculating COPQ for your organization helps you determine the potential
savings you can gain by putting quality process improvements into practice
(see Chapter 3 for more on assuring quality). How do you calculate COPQ?
Just follow these steps:
20
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

1. Identify all activities that are necessary only because of poor quality.
Conduct a brainstorming session with people familiar with the process
to identify all tasks that workers perform solely to fix quality problems.
This could include processes such as inspection, rework, repair, and
returns.
2. Determine where in the production process these activities occur.
In other words, you look at which production steps cause the quality
problems.
3. To calculate the total cost of poor quality, identify the percentage of
effort that each corrective activity consumes in its part of the produc-
tion process; multiply by the total costs in that area.
For example, if workers perform 10 percent of the effort in a production
area solely to fix quality problems, 10 percent of the entire cost of that
production step is the cost of poor quality for that area.
4. Sum the cost of poor quality for each area to get the total for your
organization.
Sadly, the COPQ for most companies ranges from 15 to 25 percent.
Reducing this value can increase the quality you provide to your 
customers.
Overshooting: Providing too much
Can exceeding the customer’s requirements in some attribute of a product ever
be bad? For example, if a customer wants a ladder that supports 250 pounds,
and you sell him one that holds 300 pounds, have you done any harm?
If all a customer cares about is how much the ladder can hold, the fact that it
holds more probably doesn’t matter. But the material and engineering that
went into adding 50 pounds to the holding capacity of the ladder likely added
cost to the product. So, at the very least, the customer can find a ladder from
another company that meets his needs and costs less. The customer also may
have unspoken requirements, such as the weight of the ladder; a more heavy-
duty ladder probably weighs more than the ladder the customer really wants.
Exceeding the customer’s requirements for other types of items may also
cause problems later in the production chain for products that use your
parts. The production process is configured to work with the product exactly
as specified; what you think are “improvements” may simply get in the way
when your product becomes part of the final result that you deliver to the
customer.
21
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance of Quality Standards

Doing more than the customer asks for is rarely a good thing, and it almost
always adds unnecessary cost to the product. The key to maintaining quality
is to make sure you know exactly what the customer wants and deliver it —
nothing more, nothing less. Conduct market research often to ensure that
you include features that are considered industry standards in your products
or services.
Setting Quality Standards 
as the Rules of the Road
Quality standards are to producing a product or service what traffic laws are
to driving. Imagine driving across a country where every state or town has its
own traffic laws. Stop signs could be red in one town and yellow in another.
Some country folk may drive on the right, and some city folk may drive on
the left. Without a commonly understood set of rules, driving would be diffi-
cult, if not impossible.
You can say the same about the products you make or the services you pro-
vide; what you produce needs to conform to standards and interact with
other products to function properly. Standards are critical for most products
and services in use today.
Following quality standards is to everyone’s benefit. Quality standards pro-
mote customer confidence in your products or services and can encourage
the growth of the entire market. Because almost all products people can buy
today contain parts or materials purchased from outside suppliers, a cus-
tomer can get stuck with a poor-quality product if one supplier fails to follow
quality standards.
In the following sections, we define quality standards, show you how to create
them, and give you a sampling of different organizations that oversee them.
Defining quality standards
Quality standards provide a common language and measurement system for
describing the quality attributes of the products or services you sell. The term
standards describes things such as specifications, metrics, or statements about
a process. Quality standards are designed to help you document what you’re
making or doing (specifications) so you can prove you followed and made
exactly what you said you would.
For our discussion about quality standards, we focus on quality management
standards. Quality management standards deal with the training, quality assess-
ment, and quality management needs of the organization. These standards
22
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

are designed to ensure that your process is capable of creating a quality
product or service.
One example of a quality standard is ISO 9000, which describes the require-
ments for quality assurance and quality management. (Quality assurance
involves examining how you do things so you can prevent flaws in your prod-
ucts and services; see Chapter 3 for details.) ISO 9000 is an international stan-
dard that helps organizations effectively document the processes they need
to maintain complete quality systems. The standards aren’t industry specific;
they’re designed to fit any process that creates a product or service. Check
out “Securing ISO Certification,” later in this chapter, for more about ISO 9000.
Creating quality standards
Quality standards, for the most part, are voluntary standards set by organiza-
tions that represent a particular industry. (See the following section for a
sampling of quality governing bodies.) Although the quality standards may
technically be voluntary, your customers may require that your business
prove that it follows the quality standards before they buy from you. Most
countries have a national standards body that sets the rules by which stan-
dards are created and maintained.
Most standards result from the collaborative effort of all the stakeholders in a
production process. As a standard develops, the people who outline the stan-
dard consider the customer and the needs of the market. This collaboration
increases the chances that consumers will accept products conforming to the
standard, but it still allows room for innovators to differentiate their products
or services.
Most formal standards start out as informal ones, created when an organiza-
tion develops a new product, service, or process to which no existing stan-
dard applies. The market leader establishes a de facto standard — one that
the market recognizes as a standard but that isn’t officially spelled out. As
the new product, service, or process becomes more popular, the need for a
new or amended formal standard becomes evident. The creation of a formal
standard usually follows these steps:
1. Someone submits a proposal for a new standard (after you conduct
research to find the appropriate standards body).
2. The standards body accepts the proposal.
3. The body drafts a proposed standard.
4. The body publishes the draft and solicits public comment.
5. The final standard is published.
6. The standards body reviews the standard on a periodic basis.
23
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance of Quality Standards

Most organizations refer to this process as an open standards process because
it gives anyone who has a stake in the outcome of the standard creation an
opportunity to make comments and suggestions.
Surveying quality governing bodies
A number of organizations develop quality standards; we list some examples
in the following sections. These and numerous other organizations work in
almost any industry or profession you can think of to develop and implement
quality standards that make sense for the producer and the consumer.
Check with industry trade groups that serve the business you’re in to find
out which quality organization(s) apply to you. A search engine on the Internet
is also a good source of information on quality standards organizations.
The International Organization for Standardization
If you’ve heard or read anything about quality certification, you’ve seen the
TLA (three-letter acronym) ISO (the study of quality is full of TLAs). The
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is made up of the stan-
dards organizations of approximately 150 countries. They work together to
develop standards to facilitate international trade. The ISO is the 800-pound
gorilla in the field of quality standards.
ISO’s quality standards fall under the heading ISO 9000. These standards are,
by far, the most widely recognized and followed. Although the majority of the
standards that ISO produces are very specific to particular industries, prod-
ucts, processes, or materials, the ISO 9000 group of standards is known as
generic management system standards.
In this case, generic means that the standards can apply to any
 Product or service
 Size of organization
 Type of industry
 Type of organization (corporate, government, or nonprofit)
Management system means that the standards focus on the processes compa-
nies use to create the products or services (quality assurance — see Chapter 3),
as well as on how these processes satisfy the customers’ requirements (qual-
ity control).
These quality standards are grouped under the designation ISO 9000:2000.
The 2000 refers to the year of the standards’ last update.
The ISO 9000 standards have become the most widely known and implemented
quality standards ever developed, used by over 750,000 organizations. We
24
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

discuss the requirements that make up ISO 9000 later in the chapter. You also
can check out www.iso.org for more information.
The American National Standards Institute
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a private, nonprofit organi-
zation that governs and oversees the voluntary standardization and conformity-
assessment system that covers industries of all types in the United States.
ANSI originally began as the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC)
in 1918, and its goal was to serve as the national coordinator in the standards
development process; as an impartial party, the organization intended to
approve national consensus standards and to stop user confusion on acceptabil-
ity. Today, ANSI is also a founder and the sole U.S. representative of ISO (see the
preceding section), and it plays a major role in the workings of that organization
for setting international standards. Visit www.ansi.org for more information.
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO),
pronounced JAY-co, evaluates and provides accreditation for hospitals and
other healthcare organizations in the United States. As an independent, non-
profit organization, JCAHO focuses on improving the quality and safety of the
care that healthcare organizations provide. Its accreditation process evalu-
ates compliance with JCAHO standards. Visit www.jointcommission.org
for more information.
Recognizing the Roles of Quality
Standards in Commerce
Quality standards play a critical role in commerce. In the following sections,
we explain how quality standards indicate customer needs, trim costs, and
ensure safety.
25
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance of Quality Standards
Standardizing ISO’s name
According to ISO’s Web site at www.
iso.org, the full name of ISO is International
Organization for Standardization, which should
be the acronym IOS in English. Because the
organization has members from many countries,
the abbreviation for the name is different in dif-
ferent languages (IOS in English, OIN in French
for Organisation internationale de normalisa-
tion). To avoid confusion, members of ISO
decided to use a name derived from the Greek
isos, which means “equal.” Using ISO as the
standard short form of the organization’s name
makes the acronym the same in any language
or country.

Communicating customers’ requirements
Quality standards communicate to the seller of a product exactly what the
buyer requires. They document what’s important to the customer and clearly
define what the producer needs to deliver to the customers. Standards pro-
vide a common language to reduce problems and misunderstandings as a
product moves from raw materials to the consumer.
Well-defined quality specifications tell the producer how “well” to build some-
thing. Although a Toyota buyer may appreciate the extra human effort that
goes into a Rolls-Royce, she definitely doesn’t want to pay for that extra
effort. (See the nearby sidebar for more about Rolls-Royce and Toyota.)
Cutting costs
Quality standards allow companies to focus on their roles in the production
process instead of spending valuable time and resources inspecting incoming
materials and parts. Imagine the cost involved in inspecting every part or
material that a vendor sends you. Multiply that over the entire production
process, and you can see how individual inspections don’t give companies an
efficient way to ensure quality. (For information on how to make sure your
suppliers are up to standard, see Chapter 3; for details on the role of inspec-
tion in quality control, see Chapter 4.)
Ensuring safety
Quality standards play an important role in safety. In fact, most standards
have their roots in providing safe products to consumers and providing safe
working conditions for employees.
For example, quality standards for food and beverages help prevent illness.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) facilitates com-
munication between the public and private sectors on creating standards
that affect safety in the workplace. OSHA also works with the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to develop quality standards related to
consumer products.
Want another example? A main driver for the creation of standards in health-
care is the concern for patient safety. Each year, JCAHO (see the earlier section
“The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations”) adds
new standards called “Patient Safety Goals,” which focus on different areas of
patient safety. For 2006, the new standards focus on areas such as assisted
living, behavioral healthcare, critical access hospitals, and laboratories.
26
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

Securing ISO Certification
How can you tell that you know what you need to know about quality? How
do your suppliers know that you know about quality? And most importantly,
how do your customers know that you know about quality? Like anything
else you’ve had to learn in your life, passing “the test” shows others and
yourself that you know what you need to know about a subject. Quality is no
different. You can prove to the world that your organization knows quality by
passing “the test” — in this case, becoming certified as an organization that
knows and follows the practices that lead to quality.
Just as passing the bar exam doesn’t guarantee that you’re an expert lawyer,
becoming quality certified from the International Organization for Standard-
ization (ISO) doesn’t guarantee that you’ll always produce a quality product
or service. What it does mean is that your organization has made an effort to
become knowledgeable in the ways of quality and has processes in place to
make the best quality product or service possible. The following sections
show you the steps of the quality certification process and how the process
can help your organization reach its quality goals. For general information
about ISO, see “The International Organization for Standardization,” earlier in
this chapter, and be sure to visit www.iso.org for additional information
about the certification process.
Looking at the basics of ISO certification
ISO certification is becoming the “standard” for certifying the ability of an
organization to produce a quality product or service. Certification shows that
your organization has proven its ability to consistently provide a product or

Man versus machine: Choosing alternative 
production methods
Rolls-Royce and Toyota are both known for 
the high quality of their cars, yet the processes
they use to produce their products couldn’t 
be more different. Although both companies use
machines to produce the parts that go into their
cars, Rolls-Royce does much of the assembly 
by hand, relying on human touch to make 
sure everything fits just right. Toyota relies on
automation to meet its goal of consistent qual-
ity from car to car.
Following quality standards doesn’t mean that
you have to do everything the same way as
everyone else; it simply means that your cus-
tomers get what they expect when they buy
your product or service.

service that meets the needs of your customers. It also means that you meet
any regulatory requirements that apply in your industry and that your
processes are designed to enhance customer satisfaction.
ISO’s standards, grouped under the name ISO 9000, are a family of standards
primarily concerned with quality management. Quality management involves
an organization’s ability to
 Meet its customers’ quality expectations
 Enhance its customers’ satisfaction in the product
 Follow applicable regulatory requirements
 Continually improve the product
Going through the ISO 9000 certification process can really improve how your
organization functions. The basic aim of the process is to help your organization
 Set quality goals and objectives
 Ensure that customer requirements are understood and met
 Train employees on producing a quality product
 Control production processes
 Purchase from quality suppliers
 Correct any problems found and adjust the process to prevent the prob-
lems in the future
Both the improvements in your processes and the quality seal of approval
can really pay off. Benefits of ISO certification to your organization include
 Increased productivity
 International recognition of the quality of your company
 Improved employee satisfaction
 Ability to compete with larger businesses
 Increased customer satisfaction
 Increased profits
 Opportunities to sell your products to new markets
For these reasons, many companies are finding that being ISO 9000 certified
isn’t simply good for business, it’s becoming a requirement for doing business.
28
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

Checking out ISO standards
As we mention in the preceding section, ISO 9000 is really a set of standards.
The main parts of the ISO 9000 standard are as follows:
 ISO 9000:2000: This standard covers the basics of the attributes of a
quality management system. It also defines the core language of the ISO
9000 standard series.
 ISO 9001:2000: This standard defines the requirements for an organiza-
tion to meet customer expectations through consistent products and
services (see the next section). It’s designed for use by any organization
that designs, manufactures, installs, and/or services any type of product
or provides any type of service.
This standard is the one to which you can be certified by outside auditors;
this is what we mean when we say an organization is ISO 9000 compliant.
 ISO 9004:2000: This standard is for organizations that have already
achieved ISO 9001 certification, and it covers standards for continuous
improvement.
The 2000 in the standard designation is the year the standard was revised.
The previous versions from 1994 also included ISO 9002 and ISO 9003, but
these were incorporated into ISO 9001 and are no longer in use. To make mat-
ters more confusing, some ISO standards that are referenced in the ISO 9000
standards aren’t in the 9000 series of numbers. For example, some of the
standards in the 10,000 series also discuss quality issues. People use the
term ISO 9000 to refer to the three ISO quality standards: ISO 9000:2000,
9001:2000, and 9004:2000.
Examining the requirements for ISO 9000
Although the ISO 9000 standards may seem overwhelming at first, they’re
really nothing more than good business practices. Five groups of require-
ments make up the standard:
 Quality management system: These requirements are broad statements
that apply to all aspects of your quality process. They outline the
requirements for your quality manual and how to control your documen-
tation and records.
 Management responsibility: These requirements describe the role of
upper management in determining the customers’ needs, planning, 
29
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance of Quality Standards

identifying responsibilities, setting objectives, and reviewing the perfor-
mance of a process.
 Resource management: This group covers the requirements for manag-
ing the resources of the organization through activities such as training
employees and providing the proper tools and equipment.
 Product realization: This group is the meat of the standard; it includes
all the requirements for how you make your product or deliver your ser-
vice. Topics include communicating with your customers, the design of
your product or service, and how you deliver to your customers.
 Measurement analysis and improvement: These requirements are what
you do to check your performance; they involve issues of how you mea-
sure performance, fix problems, and make improvements to a process.
As you can see, the standards really just prove that you know what your cus-
tomers want; that you have a plan to give it to them; that your people are
well-trained; and that you have a well-thought-out and documented process
for delivering to your customers. You also need a way to determine whether
your customers are satisfied and to demonstrate that you can identify and fix
problems. These areas are all things that any successful business must do.
ISO 9000 certification is simply a way to prove to your customers that you
know how to run your business.
Preparing for ISO 9001 certification
Preparing for ISO 9001 certification is complex and time consuming, and it
requires a lot of documentation. It also involves almost everyone in your
organization. The following list presents the steps to follow when preparing
your organization for ISO 9001 certification:
1. Get the commitment of top management.
As with any other program within the organization, support from upper
management is critical for success. The quality control process requires
extra time and resources from almost everyone, so management needs
to be prepared to see it through.
Form a quality committee to evaluate the process and its impact on your
organization. The committee should make sure that management under-
stands the total cost and schedule of the process. (See Chapter 5 for
more on forming quality teams.)
2. Train all employees.
Make sure that everyone in the organization receives basic quality train-
ing (this book can help), and select and train your internal auditors.
30
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

3. Prepare your quality policy manual.
Determine how the ISO 9001 requirements apply to your organization.
Develop vision and mission statements to reflect these requirements.
Write a basic quality policy manual outline for review by management,
and then complete the first draft of the manual. If customers request ISO
9001 compliance, send them copies to review.
4. Document operating procedures.
Define responsibilities in each part of your process, using the quality
manual you develop as a guide. Have each person document procedures
for his or her part of the process.
5. Perform an internal audit to determine your compliance with ISO
9001 standards.
The audit is basically a gap analysis between what the ISO standards are
and the current state of your production process. (This internal audit
should resemble the actual audit; see “Moving through the steps of the
audit,” later in this chapter, for details.) Develop a list of corrective
action items from the audit.
After you correct any problem items you find in the internal audit, you’re
ready to take the plunge and have a real audit performed.
Industry associations and trade groups that serve your industry are good
sources of information on ISO certification. The ISO Web site at www.iso.
org can get you started.
Sweating through an ISO audit
If you’ve prepared and practiced (see the preceding sections for the right
steps to take), you’re ready for your ISO 9001 audit. In the following sections,
we show you how to select a certification agency, and we walk you through
the steps of the audit.
Choosing a certification agency
The ISO doesn’t directly certify organizations; you have to engage an outside
organization that specializes in assessing compliance with the standard. Most
countries have formed accreditation agencies to authorize certification organi-
zations (also called registrars), which then audit organizations applying for ISO
compliance certification. Both the accreditation agencies and the certification
organizations charge fees for their services. The accreditation agencies in differ-
ent countries have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certifica-
tions issued by any of the certification organizations are accepted worldwide.
31
Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance of Quality Standards

With approximately 100 registrars in the United States, how do you select the
best one? As with most decisions, you have to consider a number of factors
when making your selection. All countries have a body responsible for con-
trolling the activities of registrars and for ensuring that they have their own
ISO equivalent quality systems. The countries maintain lists of approved reg-
istrars and check to make sure the registrars continue to meet the standards.
In the United States, you can check out the ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation
Board Web site at www.anab.org to find approved registrars.
Some registrars work only within a specific industry, which may be an advan-
tage because the one that works in your industry will be more familiar with
the processes commonly used in your industry. Review a registrar’s process
and check references to try to determine the quality of service.
When comparing costs, make sure you compare apples to apples, as fees
vary widely. Costs may include application fees, administrative fees, and 
document-assessment fees before the auditor even shows up. You also have
to pay fees for an annual or semiannual review of your quality process. Ask
how registrars calculate expenses. Some registrars with local offices fly in
auditors from other locations and expect payment for expenses. If applicable,
also ask whether an auditor has a special fee structure for small companies.
Moving through the steps of the audit
After selecting the registrar, you’re ready to go through the audit process.
Review the audit process with the registrar to make sure you’re ready. Hold a
pre-assessment audit as a final check to correct any last-minute issues (see
“Preparing for ISO 9001 certification,” earlier in this chapter, for information).
After the audit is complete, take any corrective action needed and re-audit if
necessary.
After you pass the audit, your registrar can certify that you follow the ISO
9001 standards. Your auditor will provide your organization with a letter and
a certificate suitable for framing to let the world know that you’re officially a
“quality” organization!

Using Quality Assurance 
for the Best Results
In This Chapter
 Understanding the meaning of “quality assurance”
 Managing suppliers for your benefit and theirs
 Evaluating the steps of any process
 Coming up with clear specifications
I
n the 1980s, companies around the world discovered that if they wanted
to compete in the marketplace, they had to dramatically improve quality
while reducing costs. Companies who survived accomplished this by shifting
how they managed their quality processes. Instead of relying on inspection
alone to identify and correct problems (see Chapter 4 for more about inspec-
tion), they moved toward a focus on preventing problems before they occurred.
Quality control programs evolved into a more comprehensive quality assur-
ance process. Quality control changed from being a post-manufacturing step
performed at the end of each process to being part of the process itself.
In this chapter, we explain the general concept of quality assurance and pro-
vide a few methods you can use to improve quality in your product or ser-
vice from start to finish.
Understanding the Concept 
of Quality Assurance
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO; see Chapter 2 for
more on the ISO) defines quality assurance as “providing confidence that
requirements will be met.” To meet the goal of the quality assurance process,
a company has to look not only at the product or service that’s the output of
its production process, but also at activities such as design, development,
production, installation, service after the sale, and documentation.

In other words, quality assurance is more than just checking to see that the
product or service meets the customers’ expectations; you also have to look
at the process involved in creating the product or service to see if you’re
capable of producing a quality product or service each and every time. Part
of this is
 Verifying that the materials or parts you receive are correct before they
go into whatever product or service you make or provide.
 Ensuring that the specifications for your product or service are crystal
clear.
Quality assurance is more effective the earlier it occurs in the process. In fact,
quality assurance should begin before the product is assembled or the service
is designed. How is this possible, you ask? It all starts with the suppliers!
This chapter covers these important issues and more. But before we dive
into the details of incorporating quality assurance into your workplace, we
want to discuss a few basics. In the following sections, we clarify the differ-
ences between quality assurance and quality control and explain the overall
importance of catching errors before they occur.
Recognizing how quality assurance 
differs from quality control
Here’s a good description of the difference between quality control and qual-
ity assurance: Whereas quality control includes all the tactical activities nec-
essary to produce a quality product or service, quality assurance looks at
quality from a strategic prospective. Quality control focuses on identifying
problems after they occur; quality assurance is a process for preventing
problems from occurring in the first place. Quality assurance looks at the
entire system used to create the final product or service for the customer,
not just at individual parts of the process.
Measuring quality while you create the product or carry out the service can
prevent bad output from reaching the customer. This has been a standard
practice in most industries for a long time, but a number of successful organi-
zations have adopted a dramatically different approach. Driven by competi-
tive pressures, they’ve significantly improved quality in their products and
services while reducing oversight and inspection costs.
The striking difference between the way companies have traditionally man-
aged quality and the manner in which world-class companies practice quality
assurance is that the latter defines quality assurance much more broadly,
making it an integral part of the entire process — from development to pro-
duction to sales. Several crucial techniques are common to the quality assur-
ance approach:
34
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

 Focusing on creating complete, accurate, and producible designs before
production begins by requiring communication between key players.
 Making use of process controls to design products and control the pro-
duction process as it occurs. (See Chapter 10 for details on controlling
your production process.)
 Developing programs with key suppliers to ensure the quality of incom-
ing products and materials. (See the section “Developing Trusted
Suppliers” later in this chapter for more details.)
Catching errors before they occur
Because bad processes can transform good products into bad products, and
because bad parts lead to bad products or services, a key goal in quality
assurance is to catch errors before they occur. This practice allows compa-
nies to avoid making bad parts in the first place or putting bad parts into oth-
erwise good products. It’s always cheaper and easier to do things right the
first time instead of doing something over to correct a mistake (this thought
process leads to the saying “quality is free”).
Bad parts result in bad products
You just can’t make a good product with bad parts. Most finished products
contain a tremendous number of parts, and each part must work correctly; if
not, partial or total product failure occurs. If your suppliers can’t provide you
with quality parts, you can’t make a quality product.
An example most people can relate to is the modern automobile. You don’t
think about the thousands of processes that the manufacturer performed in
bringing your car into existence until something goes wrong. It boggles the
mind thinking about the art and science that goes into building millions of
cars and trucks every year. Given the huge amount of companies, parts,
materials, people, and processes required, mistakes will be made and prob-
lems will occur. How the participants in the supply chain deal with problems
once they happen determines whether quality is improved.

Chapter 3: Using Quality Assurance for the Best Results
For want of a nail
Leave it to a nursery rhyme to sum up the qual-
ity assurance process:
For want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want
of the shoe, the horse was lost. For want of the
horse, the rider was lost. For want of the rider,
the battle was lost. For want of the battle, the
kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a nail.
As this old English nursery rhyme shows, it
takes only one bad part to turn a good product
into a bad one!

See the section “Developing Trusted Suppliers” later in this chapter to find
out how to ensure quality materials from your suppliers.
Bad processes turn good products or services into bad ones
If the process of putting together a product or providing a service is bad, the
final product or service will be bad — no matter the quality of the parts
involved. For example, an automaker can buy the highest-quality parts, but if
the car is poorly designed, the result will be a shoddy car.
One effective technique for improving a process is to educate workers about
not only their pieces of the process, but also about how their work fits into
the entire production system (with formal or on-the-job training, for exam-
ple). With this knowledge, workers can see how what they do affects others
further down the production process. You can also give them the opportunity
to make suggestions for improving the processes that lead up to theirs.
Initiatives such as these help everyone in the goal of making a better product.
(For additional information on improving an overall process, see “Focusing
on the Process with Plan-Do-Check-Act” later in this chapter.)
A good example of how looking at an entire system can improve quality is in
how hospitals provide drugs to patients. The number one cause of non-illness-
related complications suffered by hospital patients is problems with the
process of prescribing and administering drugs. The traditional process is for
a doctor to see a patient, determine what drug is appropriate for treatment,
and then send the prescription to a pharmacy to be filled. Errors can occur at
the last stage, because the pharmacist simply fills the prescription without
knowing much about the patient. An error at this stage is not only costly, but
also can be hazardous to the patient’s health.
By examining the treatment process and gathering information from doctors
and pharmacists, hospitals have found that including pharmacists on hospi-
tal rounds is a low-cost way to catch drug errors before they occur. Doctors
spend about 5 percent of their time thinking about drugs, whereas pharmacists
spend all their time thinking about drugs. By including input from the pharma-
cist earlier in the process, hospitals can prevent many potential errors.
Developing Trusted Suppliers
Every company today has suppliers in one form or another. The days of totally
vertically integrated manufacturing plants, where nothing but raw materials
come in and finished products go out, are mostly gone. Almost all manufactur-
ers of goods sold to consumers use numerous suppliers to provide the parts
that make up the finished products. Your relationship with your suppliers is
critical to producing a quality product or service.
36
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

Most organizations have an ingrained inspection-based quality process that
can be difficult to overcome. By partnering with your suppliers (or your cus-
tomers if you’re a supplier), you can drastically reduce the cost of possibly
redundant inspection processes. If you can count on your supplier to send
you a quality product, you don’t have to spend time and money inspecting
incoming material. In the following sections, we show you how to survey sup-
pliers and outline your responsibilities as a buyer.
Verifying quality with 
a supplier self-survey
In dealing with the Soviets, Ronald Reagan famously said, “Trust, but verify” —
you should adopt the same policy with your suppliers. Although you want to
have a partnership with your suppliers to produce a quality product or ser-
vice for your end customers, you must remember that you’re still separate
companies, with your own goals and objectives.
The best step you can take to verify the quality of your suppliers is to admin-
ister a supplier self-survey. The survey lets you know whether the supplier is
using the appropriate quality processes in producing your product. The sup-
plier fills out the survey and returns it to you, along with any necessary docu-
mentation (such as copies of any certifications, organization charts, and so
on). You should send the survey to all prospective suppliers before you add
them to your approved supplier list (see the following section for details
about this list).
You can also use the survey whenever a supplier undergoes a major change
that may affect product or service quality, such as the following:
 New or updated facilities
 New or updated equipment or capacity
 Key management personnel changes
 Change in the status of the business (such as its legal structure)
 Expansion or contraction of the business
 Changes in the product line (such as model changes)
 Changes in the company’s financial situation (such as bankruptcy or a
credit rating change)
When you send the survey to the suppliers, assure them that you’ll treat all
information in the survey as confidential, and you won’t disclose the informa-
tion to other parties except as required for quality assessment purposes.
They’ll want your assurance that you won’t share any confidential informa-
tion with their competitors.
37
Chapter 3: Using Quality Assurance for the Best Results

So, what questions should you include on the supplier self-survey? The exact
questions vary by industry and the requirements you place on your suppli-
ers, but the survey typically consists of the following five parts:
1. Basic company profile information
2. Information about facilities and equipment
3. Documentation of their suppliers
4. Organizational structure and human-resource environment
5. Quality systems and certifications
See Figure 3-1 for an example of a supplier self-survey questionnaire. Review
each section, and modify the questions to fit your situation. For example, 
you may need to add industry-specific certifications that your suppliers need
to have.
In addition to using the supplier self-survey questionnaire, you can perform
on-site audits at potential or existing suppliers to see for yourself that the
appropriate quality controls are in place before you place orders for the
supply of materials and services (that’s the verify part). You should review
the effectiveness of your suppliers’ quality systems at regular intervals —
and more frequently for more complex items or if the suppliers have experi-
enced recent quality problems. The frequency of the audits depends on your
confidence level in the supplier to provide you with a quality product. Your
internal quality people are the most qualified people to audit your suppliers.
Knowing your responsibilities as a buyer
As a quality buyer, your job is to ensure that only quality parts and materials
come into your process. You shouldn’t just trust your suppliers like you trust
hot-dog makers (you don’t want to know what kind of parts they use). And
how do you do your job? To start, you should follow these steps:
1. Continuously monitor quality and delivery performance of all suppliers,
using a monthly supplier performance rating system. Develop a point
system to rate suppliers on important areas such as on-time delivery,
defect rate, and flexibility in meeting your production requirements.
2. Distribute the monthly supplier performance report to all affected
departments.
3. Ask any suppliers you associate with poor quality performance to imple-
ment corrective actions and report these actions to you in writing.
Suppliers should return their reports within two weeks of receiving
notice of poor performance.
38
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

4. Remove suppliers from the approved supplier list if their performance
continues to be inadequate and they show no signs of improvement.
Establish a timeframe for removal from the list based on the importance
of the supplier and the availability of suitable replacements.

on the list, make it mandatory that the quality manager and your purchasing
manager approve of the transaction in writing.
Make an updated approved-supplier list available on the company intranet,
or print and distribute a list to all applicable employees at least monthly. And
make sure you document any disputes or problems with the quality you
receive from a supplier.
Here are a few more tips regarding the supplier-buyer relationship:
 The quality manager and purchasing manager should work together to
ensure that all suppliers meet the quality requirements of the organiza-
tion. Any problems with a supplier regarding the quality of supplied
products or services should involve both of these managers.
 Keep communications open with your approved suppliers to facilitate
quick identification and resolution of any quality problems.
 Identify who should get involved if the quality and purchasing managers
can’t resolve a quality problem with a supplier (usually someone such
as the Vice President of Manufacturing or the Chief Operating Officer).
Focusing on the Process with 
Plan-Do-Check-Act
To make improvements in the quality of your product or service, quality
assurance focuses on the processes you use to make the product or provide
the service instead of only performing tests on the final product. Probably
the most well-known technique used for identifying spots for improvement
processes is called the Plan-Do-Check-Act, or the PDCA Cycle. In the following
sections, we describe the main stages of the cycle and techniques you can
use to complete each stage.
Walter Shewhart, a pioneering statistician who developed Statistical Process
Control while at Bell Laboratories (see Chapter 10 for more about this tech-
nique), created the PDCA Cycle technique in the 1930s. Shewhart’s friend W.
Edwards Deming, a famous quality management guru, made the technique
popular in the 1950s.
The major stages of the PDCA Cycle
The idea behind the PDCA Cycle is that process improvement isn’t a one-time
linear event; it’s a continuous cycle of activities that make the process better
and better over time (see Figure 3-2). The following list outlines each stage:
41
Chapter 3: Using Quality Assurance for the Best Results

1. Plan to improve the process by identifying what’s going wrong and
coming up with ideas to make it better.
The planning stage involves a few steps:
• Make sure you clearly define the problem and have a measurable
goal for the effort involved.
• Identify the process or processes that impact the problem and
select one to work on.
• List the steps involved in the process, and review the steps to iden-
tify potential causes of the problem.
• Collect and analyze data related to the problem to identify the
problem’s root cause. (See Chapter 8 for more on collecting data.)
For example, suppose you’re trying to reduce the number of reported
bugs in a software program. You would review your software develop-
ment process to look for areas that seem to have the biggest impact on
the number of bugs created.
2. Do small changes a little at a time to minimize disruption to your normal
activities, which allows you to clearly see the effects of the change.
Establish criteria for selecting which solution to try, and implement the
solution on a pilot basis to limit potential problems.
In our software example, we may decide to add a code review process to
see whether the bug count decreases.
3. Check whether the small changes are producing the desired result.
To carry out the checking stage, you should
• Gather the appropriate data on the solution you implement.
• Analyze the data to see if you achieved the desired result; if not, go
back to the Plan stage.
After three months of performing code reviews, we look at the bug count
for the software to see whether it’s decreased.
4. Act on what you discover, and implement positive changes throughout
the process.
Identify the changes required to make what you’ve learned part of your
process, and plan ongoing monitoring of the solution to make sure it
doesn’t cause new problems.
If the bug count has gone down, you make code reviews a permanent
part of the software development process. If the bug count hasn’t gone
down, go back to the Plan stage to look for other things to try.
5. After you solve the problem and improve the process, start over again 
to plan the solution to the next problem in a never-ending improvement
cycle.

Tools for working through 
each PDCA stage
At each stage of the PDCA Cycle, you have numerous tools and techniques at
your disposal to complete the steps required for success in the stage; we dis-
cuss these items throughout this book. The following sections outline the
tools and techniques in an easily accessible list format (if you haven’t gath-
ered it already, lists are to become a big part of quality control life).
Planning tools
You can facilitate the Plan stage by using any of the following tools:
 Flowcharting: Draw a diagram that shows the step-by-step progression
of the product through the process.
 Customer/supplier mapping: Create a diagram of the interactions
between all customers and suppliers in your supply chain.
 Brainstorming: Bring together a small group to brainstorm possible
problem solutions.
 Pareto analysis: Use the 80/20 rule to narrow the problems you need to
work on — look at 20 percent of your activities that cause 80 percent of
your problems.
 Evaluation matrix: Develop problem evaluation criteria and relative
weights to rank each problem.
 Cause-and-effect diagrams: Draw a chart that shows the problem and
the reasons why the problem occurred to look for root causes.
Doing tools
The Do stage may require any of the following techniques:

Chapter 3: Using Quality Assurance for the Best Results

 On-the-job training: You can train your workers while on the job in
order to implement changes to a process.
 Experiment design: Design experiments and expected outcomes to
determine the effectiveness of the change.
 Small-group leadership skills training: Help lead the team to make the
required changes.
 Conflict resolution: Build the skills needed to resolve issues between
the people and departments performing the process.
Checking tools
You can complete the Check stage by using any of the following tools:
 Data worksheets: Track important outputs from the process.
 Control charts: Measure data to determine whether the process is 
consistent.
 Key performance indicators: Identify the factors that directly and indi-
rectly influence the effectiveness of the process.
 Graphical analysis: Graph the process results to highlight any changes.
Acting tools
The Act stage puts the process in place by using any of the following tools:
 Process mapping: Draw an updated diagram of the process for all to see.
 Process standardization: Compare the updated process to other exist-
ing processes to look for issues or opportunities.
 Formal training for the new process: Make sure everyone performs the
new process correctly.
Getting What You Really Need with
Product or Service Specifications
Just as a football team needs a playbook so that every player knows his role,
a quality product or service needs a specification with every step in the
process clearly defined so that everyone knows exactly what needs to be
done. Your goal is to instill trust and confidence in your employees that the
production process will create a quality product or service. This process
doesn’t happen by itself; you have to look at other required ingredients:
44
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

1. Create a specification that defines the requirements of the product or serv-
ice. The design and production team should work together on this task.
2. Production follows the specifications.
3. Implement conformance-testing checks so that the quality team can con-
firm whether the requirements in the specifications have been correctly
implemented during production of the product or in the execution of the
service.
The three parts (specifications, production, and testing) are interrelated. You
can look at the three processes as a three-legged stool. Each leg depends on
the other two; like a stool, if one of the legs is broken, the stool keels over.
The specification, however, is the key leg, because the requirements in the
specification form the basis of production and are used as the basis of quality
testing (which we cover in Chapters 7 and 8). Incorrect requirements can
cause problems in production, testing, or both.
In the following sections, we explain how to craft clear specifications, and we
warn you about the dangers of including extra info in specifications.
Creating clear specifications
To know what’s required to produce a quality product or service, you must
have clear specifications. The specifications must contain all the information
you need to produce a quality product or service for the customer. If the
requirements aren’t correct, everything else that follows probably will be
incorrect. Good specifications have the following attributes:
 The desired final result is clearly defined. You need to tie down the
requirements to specifics, not in vague generalities. Use terms not sub-
ject to interpretation, such as 6.0 inches, 2.35 ounces, and so on.
 They capture all the customer requirements. Make sure that everything
important to the customer is what the customer really wants. (See
Chapter 6 for more about listening to the voice of the customer.)
 They’re precise, unambiguous, and measurable. Clear, commanding
words in specifications make what’s expected very clear and don’t leave
anything to discretion. You may decide to use “shall,” “shall not,”
“must,” and “must not.” For example, a good specification is “the hole
must be 6.0 inches in diameter.”
You can’t clearly test words such as “should,” “should not,” “recom-
mend,” and “may,” making them poor words to use in a specification.
The worst words to use are “of best quality” and “good” because they’re
not precise or testable.
45
Chapter 3: Using Quality Assurance for the Best Results

 They define clearly what’s expected of the production worker.
Production workers need to know exactly what you expect of them and
how you’ll measure their conformance to the specifications.
 They’re defined in a formal technical language — not English. Most
operations have a precise language that uses words with unambiguous
meaning — use this language in place of plain English.
After the specifications are clear, make sure to train everyone involved in
production on how to use the specifications. A formal training process that
includes an assessment is the best way to ensure that everyone understands
the specifications.
Avoiding extras in specifications
Just as important as getting what you need out of a process is not getting
what you don’t need. Anything added beyond what’s required in the specifi-
cation may seem like a good idea at the time, but overkilling the require-
ments may cause unintended problems later in the supply chain. Even if you
don’t cause harm later, adding aspects to the product that you don’t outline
in the specification just adds cost to the product. Your process should pro-
duce the product to meet the specifications — nothing more, nothing less.
For example, a supplier might decide to use a heavier gauge material to make
a product stronger, which it thinks is an improvement. However, the original
design might have been more than strong enough for your purposes, and 
the increased weight might cause your product to be too heavy for the cus-
tomer’s needs. Process and product improvements should be designed in,
not added on a whim and without consideration for unintended side effects.

I
n a perfect world, your product or service would always come out just
right, but sometimes mistakes happen, and the only way to catch these
mistakes is to inspect items before you ship them to consumers. In this chap-
ter, we discuss the role of inspection in quality control: when it’s appropriate,
how to do it properly, and how it fits into your overall quality process.
Examining the Basics of Inspection
No matter the product you create or service you provide, you have to com-
plete a series of steps before you can deliver to your customers. Errors can
occur at any one of these steps, causing your product or service to fall short
of your customers’ expectations. How do you catch these errors before they
reach the customer? Inspect the product or service at key points between
major steps in production and remove or repair any bad items along the way.
Inspection is the analysis or examination of an item carried out to determine
whether it’s defective. Experts use the terms conforming to say that an item
meets customer specifications and nonconforming if it fails. Quality control
managers use two approaches to determine if a product conforms:
 Examine the item or the results of the service and compare it to some
standard description or image.
 Measure some physical property of the item or service and compare the
measurement with a customer specification.

In the following sections, we define the term “defect” and explain the impor-
tance of inspection so that you don’t allow your customers to catch product
errors before you do. We also introduce the basic concepts at the heart of
inspection: measuring attribute and variable data.
The definition of “defect”
In Chapter 1, we define quality as conformance to customer specifications; so,
is nonconformance the same as a defect? Well, not exactly. A defect is a glitch
that prevents your product or service from being acceptable to the customer.
Nonconformance means that you didn’t match the customer or product speci-
fications. They’re not exactly the same. The bottom line is that every defect
means the product doesn’t conform to specifications, but not every noncon-
formance is a defect.
A defect may prevent the product from working 100 percent, or it may simply
be a cosmetic blemish. If the hard drive in your laptop fails, it has a defect
because the laptop is unusable. If your laptop has a scratch, it has a defect
that makes the machine look less impressive, even though it still functions.
If the manufacturer of the laptop installs the wrong hard drive, but it has the
same or larger capacity, the machine wouldn’t have a defect. The laptop is
perfectly usable, and you may not even notice the difference. However, the
laptop doesn’t conform to specifications because the manufacturer didn’t
build it as planned — in other words, the laptop is nonconforming.
The importance of catching bad products
before your customers do
Why should you worry so much about catching defective products and serv-
ices? Wouldn’t it be cheaper to tell your customers that you’ll replace any defec-
tive products and save yourself all the time and effort? The reality is that both
are costly, but the cost of giving defective products to your customers is much
more damaging than the cost you incur to replace the items. And you’re not the
only one to incur the costs; your customers incur them, too. The following list
presents costs associated with producing defective products:
 Premature failure of a part, which damages the entire product
 Chasing down problems that occur when the customer uses the item
 Extra material required to repair the item
 Delivery costs to replace the defective item
 Customer charges for costs incurred
48
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

 Effort spent by the customer determining whether the item is conforming
 Potential loss of business due to poor reputation
 Costs to acquire new customers to replace lost ones
 Any safety margin designed into the process to allow for variation (see
the next section for more about variation)
Your goal is for your product or service to meet your customers’ requirements
each and every time, with a minimum of variation between individual units.
Achieving this goal lowers the cost to both the producer and the customer.
The heart of inspection: Attribute 
and variable data
To inspect for quality, you first must decide what product or service charac-
teristics you want to inspect, and then you determine what values will signify
that the product or service conforms to customer specifications. The follow-
ing list presents two types of data used to measure an item’s quality:
 Attribute data: Qualitative information about the product, such as “the
label is in the correct place” or “the light is red.” Attribute data clearly
defines whether the product achieves conformance; either it does or it
doesn’t. For example, if a light must be red, either it is or it isn’t.
 Variable data: Measures some physical characteristic such as length,
width, temperature, time, and so on. Variable data is great when you
have a desired target value and you can determine the amount of varia-
tion from the target. For example, a product may require a part to be 3.5
inches in length — you can measure the length of the part to see how
close to 3.5 inches it falls. You may require your lawn service to cut the
grass to a height of 2.5 inches. Your marketing consultant may guarantee
to increase your sales by 10 percent.
You can turn variable data into attribute data by comparing it to specification
limits for the product — it then conforms or it doesn’t. For example, you may
want a product to be 3.5 inches in length, but the customer will accept it as
short as 3.495 inches or as long as 3.505 inches. If the part falls within this
range, you can accept the part as conforming to the customer’s specifications.
Although attribute data is very useful in clearly stating whether you’ve met
the customer’s requirements, you can’t perform any analysis on attribute data
other than counts. To do a more sophisticated analysis than simple counts,
you must convert attribute data to variable data. You can turn attribute data
into variable data by using a scale to describe the characteristic, called a
Likert scale. A Likert scale typically has five values, although some companies
use seven or nine. The following is an example of a Likert scale:
49
Chapter 4: The Role of Inspection in Quality Control

Statement: The color is uniform.
1. Strongly disagree
2. Disagree
3. Neither agree nor disagree
4. Agree
5. Strongly agree
You may decide that any score less than 3 is nonconforming, at which point
you label the part as defective.
You also can track the value for each part by using this scale and then track
changes in value over time. This tactic helps you determine whether the
process is getting better or worse over time. (See “Tracking Defects to
Improve Your Business,” later in this chapter, for details about tracking.)
Recognizing and Addressing the
Challenges of Quality Inspection
Although all this inspection stuff may look good on paper, it can be difficult to
implement in practice. An effective inspection process requires a change in
how your company normally manufactures a product or provides a service. In
the following sections, we discuss human error in the inspection process and
the financial costs of implementing an inspection process, and we give you
ways you can change your production process to address these issues.
Getting a grip on the human 
aspect of inspection
One challenge in the inspection process is unavoidable: The more humans
you have working in the inspection process, the greater the chance for
human error. You must pay attention to two categories of errors people can
make during the inspection process:
 The inspection doesn’t detect an error. This category is called
Consumer’s Risk, because the consumer risks receiving a defective item.
 The inspection reports an error that doesn’t exist. This category is
called Producer’s Risk, because the producer risks rejecting a good item.
One way to remove the human element from inspection is to use inspection
equipment. Some machines may detect blemishes on an item (such as looking
50
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

for insect damage on vegetables), while other machines can measure weight,
size, color, and so on. (These examples illustrate attribute and variable data,
which we discuss earlier in this chapter.) Some include machine vision that
can visually inspect a part just like a person would, only much faster.
Even with machine inspection, an item can become damaged during packag-
ing after it goes through inspection. With some operations, you can inspect
and package items in the same process, which can eliminate defects that
occur after inspection.
Totaling the expenses of inspection
You have many costs to consider when designing your inspection process.
Some costs include the following:
 Setting up inspection equipment: Time and expense involved in setting
up your inspection process
 Labor costs: Cost of inspectors and supervisors
 Machine costs: Measuring equipment, inspection machines, and so on
 Space costs: The space in the facility used by the inspection process
 Time spent on bad parts: Time wasted when inspectors assume that
parts are correct — production continues, but you later find out that
you must scrap some parts
 Time spent waiting on inspection: Parts sitting idle and not moving
through the production process or being shipped
Of course, the cost of your quality processes, including inspection, should be
less than the cost of poor quality (see Chapter 2 to find out how to calculate
this cost). As with any other business investment, you need to calculate the
total return on your inspection investment to help guide you.
Jumping over other inspection hurdles
Some of the additional challenges you should expect to face when implement-
ing a quality inspection program include the following:
 Developing processes for accurately measuring the product or serv-
ice: Each new product or service presents its own set of measurement
challenges. Accurate measurement is important to avoid unnecessary
waste and effort.
 Inspection speed and accuracy: In most cases, speed is the enemy of
accuracy. You need to find the right balance for your process.
51
Chapter 4: The Role of Inspection in Quality Control

 Employee awareness and training: Employees require proper training
to perform the inspection correctly.
 Communication with customers: Your customers, in many cases,
require you to provide details about your inspection process as part of
their evaluation of your quality (see the later section “Considering differ-
ent factors as you select an inspection process”).
 Consistency in the inspection process over time: As you add new prod-
ucts, machines, and people to the process, it becomes difficult to main-
tain consistency.
 Maintaining consistency over multiple production sites: You need to
remain vigilant for local deviations from the corporate best practices.
 Developing the skills to meet tighter specifications: Your customers
will require tighter specifications over time as they strive to improve the
quality of their own products.
 Focusing on the important issues: Make sure you focus on the vital few
issues and not the trivial many (remember the 80/20 rule; see Chapter 8).
 Educating suppliers: Keep suppliers in the loop about your inspection
process and work with them to reduce the overall cost of inspection.
Simple changes in their processes could pay big dividends in your
inspection process.
 Motivating people to take responsibility for their work: The more
people feel responsible for their work, the better the inspection process.
 Getting reasonable requirements from the customer: Just as you work
with your suppliers, work with your customers to look for possible effi-
ciency improvements between your process and theirs. (See Chapter 6
for more about the voice of the customer in quality issues.)
 Management support: Continued management support is critical in
keeping everyone focused on improving quality.
 Root-cause analysis of failures: Getting to the real cause of quality prob-
lems can be difficult.
Choosing the Inspection Approach 
That Fits Your Company’s Needs
Given your situation, how much inspecting should you do? The inspection
process comes with three options:
 Zero inspection
 100% inspection
 Acceptance sampling by lots
52
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

In the following sections, we provide you with different factors to think about
when selecting an inspection process, and we give you brief overviews of dif-
ferent inspection processes.
Considering different factors as you 
select an inspection process
Before you implement an inspection program, you need to think about the
following factors to determine the right amount of inspection:
 Acceptable quality level: Because it all starts with the customer, your
first order of business is to determine the quality level required by your
customers. We call this the acceptable quality level, or AQL. You express
the AQL value as a percentage of defects that the customer will tolerate.
The fewer defects your customers will tolerate, the more rigorous your
inspection process must be.
 Nature of the production process: Do you produce your products one at
a time in a continuous process, or do you produce them in batches?
 Variation in the process: The more consistent your process, the less
likely you are to produce bad products. A stable process has very little
variation between individual items.
 Cost of inspecting a product: The more inspection costs, the less
inspecting you’ll want to do.
 Cost of shipping a defective product: Is the product small and returned
easily or big and difficult to return? How much does it cost your cus-
tomer to receive a bad product from you? The more expensive the ship-
ping, the more important it is to send an acceptable item the first time
to avoid the expense of return shipment.
 Value of the product: You can afford to spend more on inspection if you
produce a high-value product.
 Probability that inspection doesn’t detect an error: The higher the
probability, the more inspection you may need to do. If the result of not
detecting an error is very costly (high cost in dollars or human life), you
need to increase the level of inspection. If the cost is high enough, 100%
inspection may be justified.
 Probability that inspection reports an error that doesn’t exist: The
higher the probability, the greater the cost incurred from rejecting an
item that truly is acceptable.
Figure 4-1 is a simple chart that you can use to determine the best inspection
process for your company.
53
Chapter 4: The Role of Inspection in Quality Control

Checking out zero and 100% inspection
If you know that your company produces more bad products than your cus-
tomers will accept, zero inspection isn’t an option. On the other hand, we can
list several reasons why you likely won’t inspect all the items that you pro-
duce (100% inspection):
 The testing process may be destructive. Testing rifle bullets or the
amount of weight an item holds destroys the sample being tested.
 The cost of inspecting each product may be prohibitive. Items of low
value, such as common nails, just aren’t worth inspecting.
 The time required to inspect each product properly may be prohibitive.
Surveying lot sampling
In most cases, zero inspection isn’t an option, and 100% inspection is too
costly. So, what do you do? For most organizations, the most sensible approach
to inspection is to inspect enough of the products to catch most of the bad
ones, but not to inspect so many that you drive your costs too high. Instead
of inspecting each product, you select a sample of the products for inspec-
tion. This process is known as acceptance sampling by lots.
In the following sections, we show you how lot sampling works and present
several different types of lot sampling.

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

Reviewing lot sampling’s job description
When you lot sample, you take a product sample from a “lot” of products and
pass judgment on the lot based on testing from the sample — known as lot
sentencing. The lot is made up of products that have something in common,
such as the following examples:
 Produced by the same machine
 Produced by the same operator
 Produced from the same batch of raw materials
 Made at the same time
After you test the sample, you typically accept or reject the entire lot based
on the results of the test. The tests you use can focus on attribute or variable
data, which we discuss earlier in this chapter.
Perform any sampling entirely at random to avoid anyone gaming the system —
you want to vary the time, day of week, machine number, and so on for pick-
ing the sample to inspect. Use a random number chart or generator to pick
products from the lot for testing. You don’t want to always pick from the same
spot in the lot; an operator paid by the piece may be tempted to ensure that
items he knows are good appear in the spot you pick from.
Hand-picking the best lot-sampling method
When it comes to lot sampling, you have three commonly used sampling
methods to choose from. The following list presents them in detail.
To make the decision on which sampling method to use, compare the aver-
age sampling savings gained by the different sampling methods to the added
cost and complexity of these methods. The use of software to calculate the
sample size required, based on your quality goals, is critical to making this
decision. Your industry’s trade group or a search on the Internet can provide
you with information on available software.
 Single sampling: You take a single sample from the lot and accept the lot
if the number of defective products is less than a certain number (the
acceptance number). You calculate the sample size and acceptance
number based on the size of the lot, the acceptable quality level, and the
amount of Producer’s and Consumer’s Risk you’re willing to take (see
the earlier sections “Considering different factors as you select an
inspection process” and “Getting a grip on the human aspect of inspec-
tion” for info on the last two criteria). You must choose the samples ran-
domly to reduce the chances of an error reaching the customer.
55
Chapter 4: The Role of Inspection in Quality Control

 Double sampling: You take a smaller sample for double sampling than
you do for single sampling. You perform your tests, and if the products in
the lot pass the tests, you accept the lot. If you don’t accept the lot, you
take another sample, retest, and combine the results of both samples to
determine the fate of the lot. Double sampling works well if your process
produces good products for the most part. This method can save you
time and effort compared to single sampling; however, it’s more complex
to administer, and it may increase the opportunity for inspection errors.
 Sequential sampling: You keep testing products from a lot, and after you
inspect each item, you make a decision to accept or reject the lot or to
continue sampling. With sequential sampling, you could end up conduct-
ing 100% inspection on the lot. The advantage to sequential sampling is
that the sample size can, on average, be much smaller, based on the
number you decide must be good before you can accept the lot (in other
words, the acceptance number). The disadvantage of sequential sam-
pling is that it doesn’t account for variation from one lot to another.
No matter which sampling method you use, you may want to consider using a
rectifying scheme, where you subject all rejected lots to 100% inspection.
Most companies use this tactic. You replace all defective products in the lot
with good products. The customer receives two types of lots:
 Lots with some defective items that have passed inspection by sampling
 Lots that you’ve subjected to 100% inspection with no defective items
Tracking Defects to Improve 
Your Business
After you know a little bit about inspection, what should you do? Do you just
inspect your products, removing the bad ones and sending the good ones to
your customers? Can you do anything to actually prevent making more bad
products in the future?
The smart thing to do is to learn from your mistakes to make fewer mistakes
in the future. One good learning vehicle is properly tracking your defects. In
the following sections, we explain why you should track trends in your pro-
duction process, keep careful records, and calculate the cost of rework so
you can better your business.
Following trends in your process
By tracking trends in your production process, you can create a process
that’s more stable and features a small enough variation that drastically
56
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Quality Control 

reduces nonconformance (see the earlier section “Examining the Basics of
Inspection”). You call processes that can do this capable — that is, they’re
capable of consistently producing quality products.
Performing a simple inspection allows you to determine whether a product is
conforming or nonconforming. However, if you use variable data (covered in
the section “The heart of inspection: Attribute and variable data”), you can
use statistics to
 Detect when a process is getting worse and will soon cause a defect
 Reduce variation to improve quality
 Detect causes of variation
Using variable data in this way is called Statistical Process Control (SPC). We
cover SPC in much more detail in Chapter 10. For now, you need to know that
making SPC part of your inspection process allows you to track trends in your
production process and to help find the cause of problems.
For example, say you need to drill a hole a half-inch in diameter. Your specifi-
cations say that the hole’s diameter can be between 0.495 inches and 0.505
inches. When you first begin drilling holes, you see that they start out at 0.5
inch. But as you cut hundreds or thousands of holes, you begin to notice that
the holes are getting slightly smaller and smaller. As the sizes of the holes
start to reach 0.495 inches, you can safely bet that the drill bit is wearing
down and needs replaced.
SPC is used in most types of quality control. With SPC, you can
 Reduce the risk of defective parts and the need for inspection
 Detect information on production trends and causes of problems that
you can use in the future
 Minimize the cost caused by defects in your process
Keep in mind that you also can use SPC for services that might produce
errors, such as creating legal documents or preparing tax returns. In these
cases, you can track the number of errors categorized by the type of error.
Keeping careful records
Keep careful records of the defects that you detect during the inspection
process and what you’re doing to fix them and prevent them from occurring
in the future. The ideal system for tracking defects does so automatically,
with information available at all times in real-time. When your company is
just getting started with inspection and quality control, a manual process
works fine as you refine your data-collection process.
57
Chapter 4: The Role of Inspection in Quality Control

Figure 4-2 is an example of a manual form that can get you started. Your form
will vary, depending on your industry; a defect form for a software company
is much different than a form for a washing machine maker.
The following list presents some of the basic data you should collect:
 Product or service name
 The person or machine that detected the defect
 The date and time you detected the defect
 Description of the defect
 The impact of the defect
You may want to have separate values for the impact on the customer
and the impact on your production process.
 An assessment of the impact of the defect on other parts of the produc-
tion process or the business as a whole

 The actual effort required to resolve the defect
 The status of the defect

 The final solution to preventing reoccurrence of the defect
Keeping careful records makes it possible to see patterns that may develop
and to see shifts in your process that you may be able to tie to some event (a
new machine, a new employee, and so on). Customers also may require that
you keep records so they can perform a quality audit of your organization.
Calculating the cost of rework
You’ve heard the saying: “If you have time to do something over, you have
time to do it right.” This stern suggestion is especially true when you build
products or deliver services to clients. If the value of a part is low enough,
you can just throw away or recycle a bad one. But for high-value parts, you
usually attempt to fix the defect to make the bad parts good. This process is
called rework.
Although it may make sense to rework valuable parts, rework is bad for busi-
ness and a sign of a poor process. Rework is bad because
 It can be expensive.
 The cost wouldn’t be there if your production process worked correctly
the first time.
 It takes valuable resources away from the main production process.
 It slows the delivery of the product or service to the customer.
 It’s bad for the morale of employees who want to do a good job.
Capturing all the costs associated with rework can be time consuming, but
the task is necessary. You need to know the cost of rework so that as you
make improvements to your production process, you can calculate the bene-
fits of the improvements. This information is helpful when you evaluate dif-
ferent possible options for making improvements and select the improvement
process with the best payback. Management also requires a cost/benefit
analysis for changes made to the production process. When calculating the
cost of rework, make sure to include the following costs:
 Labor/personnel (including administrative time used and training costs)
 Materials
59
Chapter 4: The Role of Inspection in Quality Control

 Equipment used for rework
 Space used for rework
 Scrap disposal
Check with your accounting department — it can provide you with “fully
loaded” costs for labor and space used. Also, modify the worksheet in Figure 4-3
to fit your environment to help you calculate the cost of rework.

In this part . . .
P
romoting quality within a company isn’t hard; every-
one agrees that quality is a good idea. However, get-
ting workers to change their ways so that you can create
high-quality products can be a battle. The key is to demon-
strate why the changes are in their best interest; in this
part, we cover this idea and others for starting down the
road to quality.
Also in this part, we discuss how the customer defines
quality through what’s called the voice of the customer. 
If consumers dislike a product or service’s quality, they
won’t buy it. Plain and simple!
Finally, we show you how to measure your current quality
process and evaluate the results with the use of statistics
and Statistical Process Control.

 Obtaining the support of a sponsor for your journey to quality
 Communicating the quality process effectively throughout your company
 Finding the right combo of formal and informal employee training
 Using a pilot project to gauge readiness for a quality process
 Overcoming obstacles to implementing new quality practices
Quality isn’t a fixed destination; it’s an exciting and action-packed jour-
ney. The demands of your customers will change over time, and your
quality processes must adapt to continue to meet your customers’ needs.
You can’t fix all your quality problems with one simple program; it requires
constant correction, a little at a time, to get to where you want to go. In this
chapter, we help you overcome the natural resistance to change that a new
quality program creates, and we give you tips on keeping a pilot project on
course through communication and training. The navigator on your quality
journey is your quality control manager, but he or she needs help from other
members of the quality team and from stakeholders who have a vested inter-
est in the destination of your quality journey.
What’s New? Introducing 
Change in Your Company
Few corporate changes are as disruptive to the status quo as the introduc-
tion of a quality control process into an organization that previously went
without. Whether you plan to implement a change as minor as the reorganiza-
tion of a single workstation or as major as the reengineering of your entire
production process, you’ll encounter some level of employee resistance to
change. Change requires people to move away from what’s familiar and rou-
tine and into unknown and potentially risky territory.

When your organization starts on the road to quality, it needs to have a map
so that everyone involved knows where you’re headed and how you’re plan-
ning to get there. A quality roadmap encourages support among the employ-
ees and guides your organization toward your quality goals.
Any roadmap to quality should consist of the following four steps:
1. Needs analysis. An examination of the need for quality control. The
quality control manager typically performs this step as a repeating
cycle, involving the following tasks:
a. Analyzing the current situation
b. Negotiating with all the involved stakeholders (management, 
workers, customers)
c. Defining the organization’s needs
2. Decision process. The matching of defined needs for quality control
with the available quality control options. (Parts III and IV of this book
are full of specific quality control methods to consider.) If no existing
quality control process meets the requirements determined in the needs
analysis, the quality control team needs to develop a custom quality
control process.
3. Implementation. Integrating your quality control strategy into your pro-
duction process. Your new quality control process becomes part of how
you do business. The company will refine its processes as it gains experi-
ence and as employees analyze the new process’s impact on performance.
4. Incorporation. During this step, the new activities and behaviors
required by the individuals who make up the production process take
hold. A new quality control process requires that people change their
old behaviors; the process won’t be complete until the required new
behaviors become a natural part of each individual’s daily routine.
Implementing a quality program isn’t a one-time-and-you’re-done venture.
The people involved in a quality control process need to perform the steps
over and over again as your company moves away from where it is now to
the desired quality destination. You may take a few detours along the way,
but your quality roadmap will keep you moving in the right direction.
Performance improvement happens in steps, one project at a time.
Having a Sponsor as a Champion 
of Quality Control
Every project starts with a sponsor — anything from motivating your friends
to go to a movie to lobbying for a bill in Congress. A sponsor should be a
64
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

person with enough organizational influence to give a project credibility,
financing, and strategic direction. The sponsor also should be in a position 
to ensure the willing cooperation of all departments within an organization.
Implementing quality control processes involves changing people’s attitudes
and some of their tried-and-true business practices (see the previous section).
So, to suppress the reluctance to change, the sponsor should have a stature
lofty enough to overcome objections before they arise.
In the following sections, we describe the ideal sponsor for a new quality 
control process and the initial tasks handled by the sponsor.
Deciding on the sponsor
Ideally, the sponsor is the company’s CEO or the vice president in charge of
production. A person in either of these roles has the influence and credibility
to motivate employees and enact change. However, a department manager
may one day realize that something must be done about quality and ask to
become a sponsor. Whoever assumes the role must remain involved with the
project throughout its lifetime. As the sponsor’s interest fades, so does the
interest of the team.
Find out why the sponsor is interested in the project; the reasons will tell 
you how much support to expect. In some cases, the sponsor honestly
believes the project is a good idea and is personally interested in seeing it
through to completion. In other cases, the sponsor has to start the project
due to a customer’s complaint of poor quality. In the latter situation, the
sponsor may want only the minimum amount of improvement to satisfy the
unhappy customer. Spend some time early in the project digging around for
the motivation behind the project.
By understanding what motivates the sponsor, you may be able to educate
the sponsor on the many advantages of having a well-developed, company-
wide quality program.
Understanding the roles of the sponsor
A sponsor of a new quality control process has several important duties, as
we explain in the following sections.
Appointing a quality control manager
The sponsor’s first task is the selection of the quality control manager
(QCM). Most cynics say that the person who raises the issue gets the job 
(the sponsor, in other words). QCM by default isn’t a bad way to assign the
65
Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

responsibility because only people who believe in something raise the issues.
Still, the selection of the right QCM helps make the project a success; select-
ing the wrong person will make success much more difficult to attain.
The quality control manager is responsible for improving the quality process
as the organization becomes better at quality. Traits of a good QCM include
 Good leadership skills
 Good project management skills
 An understanding of the organization’s political landscape
To garner the support of everyone in the organization, the quality control
manager should be assigned to this task with the sponsor’s unqualified sup-
port. You need to overcome internal politics and let everyone know that the
QC team needs their assistance. As the project moves forward, regular public
displays of support are required if you want to produce a complete and
usable plan.
Figure 5-1 gives you an example of a letter appointing the quality control 
manager. The letter should not only announce the sponsor’s support for 
the quality control manager, but also outline the quality control manager’s
responsibilities and the criteria that will be used to measure the success of
the quality control efforts.
Securing approval for the process
The sponsor has additional duties on top of nominating a quality control
manager (see the previous section). The list includes the following:
 Approving the plans created by the quality control team and ensuring
that the plans meet the objectives for the project
 Reviewing the scope of the quality efforts to ensure that they fit within
what the sponsor has in mind
 Checking that any assumptions made in any plans created by the quality
control team are correct
The sponsor also must obtain approval for funding if needed.
Hiring a consultant
Some sponsors begin the quality control process by hiring outside consul-
tants. A consultant can be useful in mentoring someone in the organization to
assume the QCM position. Generally speaking, it takes more time, effort, and
expertise to organize and develop the quality control process than it does to
keep it going. As you put the process into place, the consultant can teach the
QCM the ropes and move the project along faster. Talk to companies similar
in size and operations (in your industry if possible) to find a consultant who
has successfully helped with other quality control projects.

Dear Al,
You are appointed as the Quality Control Manager for Widget Manufacturing.
Implementing quality control is a logical progression in our efforts to improve the performance of our 
business. As the manager for quality, you will be the key player in ensuring that our facility’s quality 
control plan is complete and workable. Your initial responsibility is to assist in the plan’s development 
and then assume the role as the plan’s ongoing champion.
Your responsibilities include:
• 
Ensuring that all departments have a quality plan.
• 
Ensuring that new processes and equipment are implemented to support our quality plans.
• 
Scheduling ongoing testing by department and by product.
Here are the criteria for success:
• 
Every department’s quality plan must provide for meeting customer requirements and for 
continuous improvement.
• 
Each department’s quality plan must be understandable to anyone familiar with that type of 
equipment or technology.
• 
A quality control plan will be submitted for every process in the facility.
• 
At the end of the project, the project manager will submit a list of known problems in our 
processes or equipment along with long-term recommendations to address them.

Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

The consultant’s responsibility is guiding the project, and that’s it; the con-
sultant shouldn’t assume the role of quality control manager. Every company,
every facility, and every production line is unique. The creation of a quality
product is the result of the key people at each step of the production process
doing the right thing. An outside consultant can provide considerable insight
into the quality control process, but he or she lacks in-depth experience at
your company. The consultant doesn’t know your business processes and
doesn’t understand the pulse of your business and what its key elements are.
Talk About It: Quality Communication
within an Organization
Effective communication is critical for the success of any new change in
policy within a company. How the entire quality process unfolds depends on
how well the sponsor and the quality control manager communicate to the
rank and file the importance of the quality process — not only to the organi-
zation, but also to them personally. In the following sections, we explain the
different types of quality-related information your company needs and show
you how to craft two important tracking documents.
The creation and instillation of a communications plan encompasses more
than just memos floating around the office. It should include meetings within
the various teams, meetings with the sponsor, and presentations to the vari-
ous departments. Another important communications task is to raise the
awareness of employees and how the quality control plan impacts them.
Posters, newsletter articles, and open meetings all serve to answer their
questions and instill a quality culture in your organization.
Listing the types of information 
to communicate
Each member of your organization has different information requirements
and preferred formats for receiving information. The president doesn’t
require or want the details of every meeting. A department manager wants
the specific details of what’s happening in his or her department, and only a
general idea of what’s happening in other departments. So, when implement-
ing a quality control process, a proper communication plan provides the
right level of information to the right people at the right time.
68
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Having an effective communication program becomes more critical the larger
the organization becomes.
Information that you need to communicate to your organization falls into
three main categories:
 Mandatory communications: Tasks that must be done, such as status
reports to the sponsor, meeting minutes to the team members, and so
on. Skipping a piece of mandatory communication may affect the quality
control project’s support or credibility.
 Informational communications: Includes reports to the interested and
curious. Many people will see the quality control process under develop-
ment within the organization and believe that it directly or indirectly
affects their jobs. Informational communications pass on project accom-
plishments, testing schedules, and so on. They can help to shape expec-
tations so that interested people understand what’s coming next instead
of being surprised or disappointed.
 Marketing communications: With these, you build a positive image of
your quality control project to the rest of the company. Marketing commu-
nications educate the company as a whole on quality control principles
(customer requirements, measuring quality, continuous improvement,
and so on) and how they relate to each employee’s work processes. This
type of communication helps keep everyone motivated to support the
quality control efforts.
One effective communication method is to give a presentation on quality 
control to each of the various department staffs. The more employees under-
stand quality control, the greater your support will be across the company.
Determining who communicates 
different types of information
The quality control manager must develop a communications plan that
addresses a wide range of audiences. Be sure to identify the person responsi-
ble for generating each type of communication and its major focus.
Make sure you evaluate every report and every meeting in your communica-
tions plan to make sure they’re worth the effort. Some reports may require too
much research, and some meetings are just wastes of time (we’ve all been in
one of those!). Effective communication is important for focusing a team on a
goal, but you must strike a balance between efficient communication and
wasted time.

Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

You can use Figure 5-2 to plan out who’s responsible for creating certain com-
munications. Start by making a column for each of the important communica-
tions; we used Project Plan, Status Meeting Minutes, Budget Report, and Plan
Testing Schedule in our example. (List the ones used in your organization.) In
each row, list the important positions that need to create these communica-
tions and the names that go with them. By checking off which communication
is created by which person, you create an at-a-glance reminder of who creates
what information.
Creating a stakeholder reporting matrix
After the quality control manager develops the communications plan (see the
previous section), he or she needs to create a plan that details which employ-
ees need to receive information and when. For example, who should receive
project status reports (the sponsor, perhaps)? Who needs copies of the team
meeting minutes (the department manager, maybe)? Who needs to know about
minor project delays or accomplishments (the facility’s employee newsletter)?
To manage this communication structure, you can build a matrix — a stake-
holder reporting matrix — that accounts for the information needs of all stake-
holders. A sample stakeholder reporting matrix is shown in Figure 5-3. In this
matrix, you identify the following:

 The documents they should receive
 The amount of detail to include in the documents
 The best format (hard copy, PDF, and so on)
 How frequently these people should receive the documents (daily,

The stakeholder reporting matrix also should indicate the best way to deliver
information. Do some of your executives ignore their e-mail? Do some require
face-to-face reports? Always indicate the methods of delivery to which impor-
tant people are most receptive.
Class Is in Session: Training Employees
The key to having a predictable and repeatable process that consistently
churns out a quality product or service is well-trained employees. Your orga-
nization’s employees must have the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed
to perform their duties correctly each and every time; the responsibility for
making sure this is the case falls on the organization. Employees who have
confidence in their jobs and who receive recognition for jobs well done will
produce more, in both quality and quantity, than employees who don’t feel 
so certain about their assigned tasks.

Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

Confidence in the ability to do your job can come only from knowing exactly
what to do — a knowledge cultivated by training. No amount of fancy market-
ing can make up for dissatisfied customers or missed sales opportunities due
to poor product or service quality.
Employee training comes in many flavors, depending on what works best for
your organization. You can provide training either formally or informally:
 Formal training is most effective for getting employees up to speed
quickly and consistently. Use your in-house training department, if you
have one, or use an outside firm or remote program to administer formal
training to your employees.
 Informal training often provides the deepest and richest learning expe-
riences, because this type of training is what occurs naturally in our
everyday lives. Informal training occurs within the organization, with
employees learning from one another and from executive-administered
materials.
All organizations use a combination of formal and informal training methods.
Experience with training in other areas can guide you when choosing the best
approach to quality training in your organization. We describe both types of
training in the following sections.
Training, of course, has to fit into your production schedule; some organiza-
tions find that short training sessions (one or two days) work best.
No matter what training combination you use, be sure, as a quality control
team and a quality organization, to recognize the efforts of your employees
and provide feedback to reinforce positive behavior. Make sure that supervi-
sors praise their people for doing their jobs well. Any requests for improve-
ment that an organization submits must be tied to measurable performance
standards so that employees know how you’ll measure them.
Ensuring consistency with formal training
If you need to ensure that your employee training is consistent and done on
your schedule, formal training is the way to go. With a formal curriculum, you
make sure that employees are exposed to the information they need. In the
following sections, we guide you through the steps of formal training, explain
when to use it, and show you how to find the right help.
72
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Walking through the steps
Formal training is based on a standard format (almost as rigid as those
formal dances from way back when). It usually includes the following steps:
1. Developing a specific set of learning objectives. It’s important to 
identify learning objectives and to compare the objectives to the class
curriculum. Learning objectives may include proper measurement tech-
nique, recording data correctly, or how to adjust a piece of equipment.
2. Using a variety of learning methods to reach your objectives. You
could go with a combination of the following delivery options:
• Instructor-led classroom training
• Instructor-led remote training (over the Internet, for instance)
• Electronic learning (or e-learning), such as Web-based seminars (or
Webinars) or CD/DVD-based training
From past experience with other types of training, you should know
what works best for your employees.
3. Applying evaluation activities at the end of the training periods to
determine the amount of knowledge gained. The evaluation process
should be closely associated with the learning objectives to ensure that
employees learn what needs to be learned in the training. A formal eval-
uation performed as a written test allows you to track the quality of the
instruction.
4. Developing individual training plans, with the assistance of supervi-
sors. This step helps to ensure the achievement of individual employee
development.
5. Tracking employee performance. You want to be positive that the train-
ing is improving employees’ overall performance and the achievement of
company and/or division goals.
Knowing when to use formal training
Your organization should use formal training in the following situations:
 When the skills needed for jobs are very complex and require detailed
instruction.
 When your budget for training is generous; formal training is more
expensive than informal training.
 If you find that your employees aren’t highly motivated within your qual-
ity program; a formal training program forces their participation.
73
Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

 When you need your employees to acquire the skills quickly; formal
training is the fastest method to acquire new skills.
 When job roles change frequently; formal training is the fastest way 
to get up to speed on a new role.
 When consistency of training is critical; formal training provides a 
well-defined structure to the training process.
Finding help
Look to the following sources of formal training when you decide to implement
a training program:
 Training firms: These firms have their own classrooms and instructors,
or they may take their shows on the road to your location. Use the
Internet, or talk to other companies in your area or industry for referrals
to good training companies.
 Consulting firms: These firms can help you develop your own in-house
training program tailored specifically to your needs. Again, use the
Internet, or talk to other companies in your area or industry for referrals.
 Suppliers: These folks may have training sessions that your employees
can attend to become familiar with their processes.
 Customers: If you’re selling to other businesses, some of your larger cus-
tomers may have in-house classes on quality that your employees may
be able to attend. Customers have an interest in helping you provide
quality products. Employees will find it helpful to learn firsthand how
customers use your products and services and what issues they face in
their production processes.
 Local governments: Job training programs are sometimes available
through local government. You may be eligible for financial assistance 
or access to trainers and materials in exchange for retaining or creating
new jobs.
Rounding out skills with informal training
Although formal training can go a long way toward getting employees up 
to speed on what they need to know, it isn’t the only training method you
should use. After all, your knowledge isn’t complete until you actually spend
time putting what you discover into practice. No amount of formal training
can cover all the little nuances of the job like informal, on-the-job training
can. On the other hand, although informal training can be a powerful tool, 
by its informal nature you have less control over how, when, and what’s 
communicated. So, some amount of formal training is necessary. But for now,
we take the following sections to discuss when and how to use informal train-
ing to round out the skills you need for an effective quality control process.
74
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Examining different types of informal training
Informal training can take many forms, but no matter the form, it can be an
effective way to bring your employees up to speed in your quality process.
Here are some of the ways you can implement informal training:
 Senior staff members: These employees have intimate knowledge of
their jobs. They may hold nonproduction jobs, but they still have valu-
able knowledge about your production process that they could share
with others. Make them part of your employee orientation process and
have them serve as mentors during an employee’s first few months on
the job.
 Cooperative training: Create opportunities for employees to work
together and learn from each other. Moving people around to learn 
different parts of the production process helps employees gain an 
appreciation of how the quality of their work impacts others. You can
encourage cooperation by making their participation in this process
part of their annual performance evaluations.
 Experimentation: Don’t punish employees for trying new things to
improve the production process; make sure to encourage experimenta-
tion and the sharing of lessons learned. An organization should create
an environment where employees aren’t afraid to try new things and fail.
Create a process in which employees can make suggestions and see
their suggestions tried out.
 Self-motivated training: Be generous in providing self-study materials
(such as manuals and instructional videos) for employees to use, either
on the job or during off hours.
Figuring out when to use informal training
Your organization should consider using informal training in the following 
situations:
 When the necessary job skills are easy to understand.
 If your organization has little or no budget for training.
 If your employees are highly motivated and eager to learn on their own.
 When employees can acquire the necessary skills over a long period 
of time.
 If job roles don’t change frequently.
 If you find other aspects such as camaraderie developed from mentoring
important.
75
Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

Testing the Waters with a Pilot Project
In many cases, the best approach to implementing a quality control process
is to launch a pilot project. A pilot project is a test or trial run of a process on
a small scale, conducted so an organization can evaluate the quality control
process’s effectiveness and its impact on the product being created or ser-
vice being delivered. A good pilot project allows an organization to try new
things with a minimal amount of risk. In the following sections, we show you
how to select a stellar pilot project and ensure its success as it takes off.
Choosing the right pilot project
Your organization’s quality control team needs to choose the right pilot pro-
ject in order to collect the proper information and to minimize the damage if
the pilot project goes bad. Here are some questions to ask of your organiza-
tion before you choose a pilot project:
 What are your primary reasons for implementing a new quality control
process?
• To reduce costs
• To increase revenue
• To reduce defects
• To improve customer satisfaction (see Chapter 6)
• To achieve greater flexibility
• To obtain certification (see Chapter 2)
 What are the short-term improvements you hope to see?
• Getting real-time data on your process
• Satisfying customer demands
• Achieving regulatory compliance
 What are your long-term objectives for the new process?
• More flexible production process
• Faster new-product rollout
• Access to new customers
As you evaluate potential pilot projects, use your list of reasons to determine
the one to pick first. Of course, you probably have many reasons for imple-
menting a new quality control process; your pilot project should address 
one or two of the most important reasons. Don’t try to fix too many things at
76
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

once; it’ll be more difficult to determine which part of what you did fixed
which problem.
For example, say your main goal in implementing a new quality control
process is to reduce the number of service complaints that come back to
your landscaping business. You should design your pilot project to collect
data on the reasons for the service calls and then implement changes to see
their impact on the level and type of service complaints you receive.
When looking for a proper pilot project, seek out “low-hanging fruit” — look
for areas where you think you can get the biggest return for your effort.
Succeeding early with results 
from the pilot project
One of the goals of performing a pilot project is to create early quality suc-
cesses that encourage everyone involved with the organization to support
the process and be enthusiastically involved. Here are some objectives to
keep in mind as you attempt to succeed early on in your quality process:
 Create a quality process that can be effective in multiple departments
within the organization. You want to quickly take the lessons learned
from the pilot project and spread them throughout the organization. For
example, effective measurement techniques learned in a pilot project
can most likely be used in other parts of the organization.
 Publicize early successes to clearly illustrate to the rest of the organiza-
tion the benefits of the quality control process. See the section “Talk
About It: Quality Communication within an Organization,” earlier in this
chapter, for details on communicating with employees.
 Understand the tasks and challenges involved in implementing a quality
control process and the activities required to manage it once it’s in pro-
duction. This objective includes determining realistic time frames and
budgets for a particular type of project within your organization.
 Demonstrate to the organization that the quality control team can 
successfully integrate a quality control process into your production
process. Political capital earned during the pilot project can help over-
come objections to larger projects down the road.
 Assess the organization’s readiness for quality control and gaps in the
areas of skills, technology, and process. It’s important to formally docu-
ment what you discover in the pilot project and apply those lessons to
future projects.
77
Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

Multiple pilot projects may be required to adjust your quality control process
to work best within your organization. After all, Thomas Edison conducted
more than 3,000 experiments before he perfected the light bulb. Understand
that success on the first try isn’t guaranteed, and that you shouldn’t use fail-
ure on the first attempt as a reason to abandon the effort.
Conquering Obstacles as Your Company
Implements Change
Make no mistake, all companies encounter obstacles to the changes required
to implement quality control programs. How you deal with these obstacles
may determine how successful your quality control program will be. In the
following sections, we show you how to anticipate potential problems, steer
the quality control process back on track when an obstacle derails it, and
stay positive no matter what you encounter.
Staying ahead of potential problems
To keep ahead of potential problems in your quality program implementation,
you must identify and manage the risks that can negatively affect your quality
project. Although you can’t always prevent problems from occurring, by think-
ing ahead you can minimize the damage and prevent huge train wrecks.
Here are the four basic steps to evaluating and managing risk:
1. Identify risks. Review the plan for implementing your quality control
process to look for tasks that could cause problems. Look for factors
such as
• Aggressive budgets or time schedules. You’d rather underpromise
and overdeliver. If your organization has a history of being overly
aggressive on budgets and/or schedules, watch this factor closely.
• Areas with limited resources. Important resources may become
unavailable just when you need them the most.
• Areas with limited expertise. The less expertise you have in an
area, the less accurate the schedule is likely to be.
• Tasks with a lot of resources or long durations. The longer the
task, the more likely something will go wrong.
78
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Another step you can take is to seek out experts who have implemented
similar projects — either inside or outside your organization. People
with experience may be able to help you identify risks that you would
never think of on your own.
2. Quantify risks. Calculate the costs for each risk you identify in Step 1. A
simple formula you can use to compare risks is to take the potential cost
of the risk if it occurs and multiply it by the probability that the risk will
occur. This calculation gives you an expected cost that you can use to
compare risks to determine which ones you need to worry about the
most. Note: The cost unit can be dollars or time, and you can determine
the probability by taking the best guess from your team.
For example, if the cost incurred when the risk happens is $1,000, and
your best guess of the probability of the risk actually occurring is 50 per-
cent, the cost of the risk is $500 ($1,000 × 0.50).
A spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, is a great tool for keep-
ing track of risks — especially in quantifying the risk to your project.
3. Plan for risks. Now that you’ve identified risks to your quality control
project and quantified their potential impact, you’re ready to plan for
their prevention. For each risk, determine any early warning signs that
you can watch for, and then create plans either to prevent the risk from
occurring or to mitigate the damage if you can’t prevent it.
4. Monitor and manage risks. As your quality control project progresses,
report to important stakeholders any risks that you’ve identified and
how you handled them. Talk regularly with your quality control team
about risks to the project, and make any needed adjustments to your
risk plan.
Getting back on track
Even the best quality control projects can get off track, due to organizational
politics or budgetary issues. You can get your quality control project back on
track if it loses its way by following one or more of these steps:
 Review your goals. Make sure you’re working on what’s really important
to your quality control sponsor and other stakeholders (see the section
“Having a Sponsor as a Champion of Quality Control” for more on spon-
sors). A budget can always be found for projects considered important
to the organization.
 Evaluate where your project really stands. Perform an honest assess-
ment of what you’ve achieved and where the project is having problems.
79
Chapter 5: Starting Down the Road to Quality

 Review your risk plans (see the previous section). You may be able to
find out if you can adjust them to give you better warning on problems
before they get out of control. Install an early-warning system to keep
your project from backsliding after you get it back on track.
 Get professional help. An outside expert may be able to break through
political or technical logjams that are preventing progress.
 Learn from your mistakes. Although you can’t change the past, you can
prevent the same mistakes from happening in the future.
 Determine the minimum acceptable goals of your organization.
Sometimes, the best way to right the ship is to make it more manageable
by reducing its scope. Adjust your project to meet its reduced objectives.

Chapter 6
Detecting the Voice of the
Customer in Quality Issues
In This Chapter
 Identifying what’s really important to your customers
 Measuring your customers’ level of satisfaction
 Asking customers for their opinions on products and services
Your organization doesn’t exist to provide you with a paycheck (although
you may think it does) or to give you something to do during the day.
Your organization exists to provide some product or service to your customer!
Without customers, your organization would cease to exist. Any number of
competitors are just waiting for the chance to swoop in and take your place 
if you don’t meet your customers’ needs and expectations. Identifying your
customers’ likes and dislikes so that you can continue to provide them with
the products and services they need is critical to the survival of your organi-
zation (and to the delivery of your paycheck).
In quality control, the phrase voice of the customer (VOC) describes the cus-
tomers’ needs or requirements. This phrase embodies both the needs and
requirements that customers have explicitly stated and those they may not
have told you about. Actively seeking the voice of the customer provides
benefits beyond your immediate quality concerns, including the following:
 Demonstrating to your customers that you care
 Gaining important intelligence about what your competitors are doing,
both right and wrong
 Providing information about products or services your customers didn’t
know you provide
 Reinforcing the importance of the voice of the customer to your 
employees
 Making your customers feel that you’re more than just a vendor; you’re
a partner that helps them meet their needs

In this chapter, we discuss quality issues that are critical to customers;
explain how to take stock of customer satisfaction with products and 
services; and show you how to gather information from and about your 
customers so you can improve your organization’s overall quality.
Identifying Critical-to-Customer 
Quality Issues
Because the customer is critical to the survival of a business, you need to
provide your customers with products or services they’re willing to pay for.
Your customers’ concerns should become essential parts of everything you
do. What customers want, you provide. You and your competitors have edu-
cated consumers on the importance of quality through your sales and mar-
keting efforts, and being quick studies, the customers are now using quality
as an important factor in choosing who they buy from.
When you boil down your customers’ desires, you discover that they fall into
three major categories, which we discuss in the following sections:
 They want the product or service to be perfect.
 They want it when they want it — usually now.
 They want a great price.
In other words, they want it good, fast, and cheap. The reality is that having all
three at the same time is extremely difficult, so you have to choose the right
balance in your products or services. These aspects, taken together, represent
the quality of your product or service in the eyes of your customers.
Product or service performance: 
I want it perfect!
The quality control movement that started in the last century has raised 
the bar on what customers expect in terms of quality. And as we mention
throughout this book, quality is directly related to customer expectations. All
else being equal, a customer will buy the product or use the service with the
highest perceived quality. Performance, in many cases, causes a customer to
pay a little more for a product or service or is the reason for buying a prod-
uct or using a service again and again.
If what you sell is a service, you generally measure quality by how well you
do the job. Of course, with some services, customers can’t judge the quality
of the service with authority. For example, most people don’t know enough
about medicine to know for sure whether their doctors are any good; they
82
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

base their judgments mostly on how well they “feel” about the services 
provided. Studies have shown that doctors who make their patients “feel”
better by using good listening skills and spending a little more time with the
patients are far less likely to be sued for malpractice. The customers perceive
the extra attention as better quality. Customer service, therefore, is a big part
of determining whether what you deliver is “perfect.”
Delivery: I want it fast!
Customers usually take their time deciding whether to buy from you, but as
soon as they decide, they usually want results fast. When’s the last time you
bought something and had to wait a long time to receive it? People used to
order cars to be built and delivered in several weeks; now they drive them
home the same day. People used to go to computer stores or use mail order
to buy software; now they can download software over the Internet and have
it up and running on their computers in minutes. In this time of next-day
delivery and the always-available Internet, customers are no longer willing 
to wait to receive the products they buy.
Always look for ways to reduce the time from when the customer decides to
make the purchase to when the customer gets to enjoy the product or ser-
vice. Quick delivery increases the quality of your product or service in your
customers’ eyes. With many products and services (such as a retail purchase
or a hair cut), you can deliver at the point of sale. With others, you may have
to get very creative to get at least something in the customers’ hands as soon
as possible. For example, you may provide some part or sample of the prod-
uct or service, or you may hand out a token to signify a purchase, such as a
special key for a customer who orders a car.
Cost: I want it cheap!
No matter what anyone tells you, price always matters. Customers won’t 
pay much beyond the going rate for any product or service, regardless of 
the quality. The key is to get customers to focus on the real cost over time,
not only on the price of the item or service at the time of purchase. You may
spend less for a poorly made chair, but you’ll have to replace the chair much
sooner than you would a high-quality chair. The challenge you may face is
conveying that a higher-priced item may actually be cheaper in the long run.
If your product or service is of higher quality but costs a little more upfront
to purchase, you need to motivate customers to focus on the cost of the item
or service over its useful life. For example, you could advertise to customers
that your high-quality product may have lower service costs or won’t require
the frequent upgrading that a low-quality product commands. This low over-
all cost, which is sometimes referred to as the total cost of ownership,
increases the perceived quality of your item or service.
83
Chapter 6: Detecting the Voice of the Customer in Quality Issues

Total cost of ownership includes not only the purchase price, but also factors
such as the following:
 Maintenance and repair costs
 The cost of energy to operate (such as gas for your car)
 The amount of training required
 The cost of consumable supplies (such as ink for a printer)
The focus should be on value rather than price alone; that’s how companies
such as Gucci stay in business.
Gauging Current Customer Desires 
with the Kano Model
Keeping existing customers satisfied is more profitable than finding new ones.
Many organizations spend so much time looking for new customers that they
neglect the ones they already have. Marketing studies have found that 50 to 70
percent of customers abandon companies because they feel ignored. Only 10
to 20 percent leave due to problems with the products or services, and less
than 10 percent leave for competitive reasons (such as price).
Competitors can lower their prices or copy your products or services, but
they can’t steal your relationship with your customers. Strong customer 
relationships may be your only competitive advantage. Don’t give it away 
by ignoring your current customers.
Attention to quality in your product or service says a lot about your concern
for the customer. Just as important as your product or service’s initial quality
is how you handle quality problems. Because quality is directly related to
customer requirements, understanding what will satisfy your customers is
essential for maintaining quality in their eyes.
One popular technique for organizing and prioritizing your customers’
desires is the Kano Model. Professor Noriaki Kano first developed this
approach to analyzing customer needs in the 1980s. The model is based on
the concept of customer quality, and it provides a simple ranking scheme for
organizing customer desires. In the following sections, we show you the dif-
ferent categories of customer desires in the Kano Model and explain how to
apply the Kano Model in your organization.
84
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Surveying the Kano Model’s categories
The Kano Model divides customer desires into three categories:
 Must-Haves: These features are necessary conditions or qualities that
your product or service must have before a customer even considers
doing business with you. The inclusion of these features doesn’t neces-
sarily cause customer satisfaction, but their absence automatically
causes the customer to be dissatisfied. The customer assumes that the
Must-Haves are included. An example of a Must-Have is brakes on a car.
Must-Haves are also called Threshold Attributes or Basics.
 Performance attributes: These features satisfy the customer based on
how well they function. If the performance of the product or service is
high, the customer is satisfied; if the performance is low, the customer is
dissatisfied. Customers usually know they need these features and tend
to look at them closely. An example of a Performance attribute is engine
horsepower for a sports car. Performance features are also called Linear
or One-Dimensional Attributes.
 Satisfiers: If present, these features increase the customer’s content-
ment with your product or service, but they don’t cause dissatisfaction
if you don’t include them. If you can include them, you have an opportu-
nity to “delight” the customer, which can separate you from your com-
petitors. An example of a Satisfier is good gas mileage for an expensive
sports car. Satisfiers are also called Attractive Attributes or Exciters.
Of course, customer expectations change over time. Cup holders in cars were
initially Satisfiers, but they became a Performance attribute over time as cus-
tomers discovered how useful they are. These days, cup holders are a Must-
Have — most people won’t buy cars without them. You need to constantly
monitor which category your customers put your product or service into to
know which product attributes are most important to your customers.
Using the Kano Model in a few easy steps
To use the Kano Model, follow these steps:
1. Determine the main attributes of the product or service you want to
analyze.
You have many ways to determine which attributes of your product 
or service are most important (see the following section for info on 
collecting data, for example). Example attributes may include ease of
use, durability, flexibility, size, weight, speed, completeness, and so on.
85
Chapter 6: Detecting the Voice of the Customer in Quality Issues

2. Create a questionnaire that contains pairs of questions for each
attribute at different possible levels of quality; ask one question in the
positive (for example, “How do you feel about X being present?”) and
one in the negative (“How do you feel about X being absent?”).
The answers should use a 0–5 answer scale:
• 0 — I’m not interested.
• 1 — I really don’t like it.
• 2 — I don’t like it.
• 3 — I feel neutral.
• 4 — I like it.
• 5 — I really like it.
3. Sum the answers for each attribute in your survey, using the number
scale from Step 2.
4. Plot the answers on a graph, as shown in Figure 6-1.
The X-axis represents the perceived quality of the product or service in
functionality or features. As you move to the right, the perceived quality
or functionality gets higher. The Y-axis represents the customer’s satis-
faction with your product or service; the higher the satisfaction, the
higher you are on the graph.

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

The three categories of customer desires usually appear on a Kano graph in
the following ways:
 Performance attributes plot pretty much in a 45-degree angle; that is, the
quality is proportional to the customer’s satisfaction.
 Satisfiers show a dramatic increase in customer satisfaction for small
improvements in quality.
 Must-Haves show only slight increases in customer satisfaction as qual-
ity increases, but they show dramatic decreases in satisfaction for small
decreases in quality.
To apply the Kano analysis to your product or service, and to increase its
quality in the eyes of your customers, you should now
 Make sure your product or service has all the Must-Haves. You may have
to remove attributes in the other two categories to do so, but if you
don’t include these necessary features, you’re done before you start.
 Look at the Satisfiers to see whether you can add more or improve the
quality of the ones you have. Satisfiers give you the opportunity to rise
above the competition.
 Maximize the Performance attributes within other constraints, such as
cost, to maximize the customer’s satisfaction.
 When possible, remove any attributes for which customers didn’t care
one way or the other.
Digging Up Data from (And about) 
Your Customers
The destiny of your product or service (read with a movie-trailer voice, of
course) is to satisfy the needs of your customers. And how do you know 
what your customers want? You ask! You do some research! In the following
sections, we explain how to gather information from your customers in many
popular ways, including conducting surveys and gathering focus groups. We
also provide you with some rules to follow when digging up info on your cus-
tomers, no matter which method you choose.
87
Chapter 6: Detecting the Voice of the Customer in Quality Issues

Following some important rules
No matter how you collect data on your customers, you need to follow 
certain rules to make sure you get the information you really need:
 Define your objectives. Know what you hope to accomplish before you
begin. Some techniques work better than others, depending on what you
want to find out.
 Select the customers to research. Unless you have a small customer
base, you need to choose a subset of your customers to gather informa-
tion from. Gather the maximum amount of information you can from the
most customers within the constraints of your budget. If your customers
are all very similar in needs and wants, you can use a smaller sample
size. If your customers’ needs vary quite a bit, you need a larger sample
representing each type of customer.
 Think about how you’ll analyze the data. Consider budget and time
constraints, as well as your objectives. Your method of analyzing data
affects the kind of information you can collect. If you want the process
to be highly automated, you’re limited to asking questions that have a
small set of possible answers. Closed questions (such as multiple choice
and true/false) are easier to analyze. Open questions (where customers
can answer any way they want) are much harder to analyze but may pro-
vide information about topics you hadn’t thought about.
 Use good questions. If your technique involves asking questions, make
sure the questions you ask fit with the objectives you’ve defined and 
the analysis method you plan to use. Good questions are easy to under-
stand, use the language of the customer, and aren’t leading in any way.
 Keep the data-collection process simple. Keep things as simple as pos-
sible to keep errors to a minimum. If you plan to enter the data into a
spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, design the form to look
like the spreadsheet to make entering the data easier.
 Use an unrelated party to collect the data. You may want to consider
hiring an outside firm to collect the data to prevent bias from creeping
into the answers. You don’t want your data collector to be someone who
may take the answers personally.
 Train the data collectors. Just as training is important for your quality
control people (see Chapter 5 for details), proper training of those col-
lecting customer data is important to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Make sure the data collector’s name is on any forms in case you need to
follow up later. You may discover trends that show answers varied
according to who asked the questions.
 Perform a trial run. Test your data-collection process on a small subset
of your customers to work out any bugs in the process. You may realize
that certain questions are a waste of time, but you may also discover new
88
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

questions you want answered. You could find that some questions need
to be reworded because they’re difficult for customers to understand.
Pay close attention to any questions the customers ask, taking them as
clues to what changes you need to make. A trial run also is a good test 
of any instructions for the person performing the data collection.
These rules should help you design the right data-collection process to hear
the voice of the customer. The most important points to remember are to ask
the right questions and to listen carefully to what the customer has to say.
Putting surveys to work
Having the customer fill out and return a survey is a common technique for
hearing the voice of the customer. A survey can be a great way to get cus-
tomers to open up about problems, especially if people complete the survey
anonymously. Surveys also are great for market research and for pointing out
the availability of products and services the customer may not know about.
Your organization can conduct a survey the old-fashioned way with pencil
and paper; you can contact customers over the phone; or, as is becoming
more common, you can post a survey on the Internet.
Here are three main steps to follow to create a successful survey (for general
information, see the preceding section):
1. Determine the survey’s objective(s).
Staying focused and developing the right questions is easier if your
objectives for the survey are clear. Take advantage of the opportunity
not only to focus on quality issues, but also to promote your business.
Asking questions that cover the entire range of products or services you
provide may alert customers to items they didn’t realize you featured.
Objectives can include looking for quality gaps, uncovering desired 
features, or finding out what’s important to a new demographic.
2. Develop the questions and conduct the survey.
Keep the questions short and to the point. Don’t include any unneces-
sary questions, because shorter surveys are more likely to be com-
pleted. Examples of good questions include the following:
My top priority in buying a new car is
a. Styling
b. Gas mileage
c. Horsepower
What’s the maximum number of minutes you’re willing to wait for service?
How many widgets have you purchased in the last 12 months?
89
Chapter 6: Detecting the Voice of the Customer in Quality Issues

3. Analyze the results.
Be careful how you analyze the data. Take sample size into account — the
smaller the sample size, the larger the potential error. Try not to force fit
the data into a pre-existing point of view. You don’t want to read too much
into small differences in data (such as saying customers really want
Product A when they chose it over Product B by a small percentage).
Customers can complete the survey in person, or they can fill out the survey
and send it back. In-person surveys are more expensive but make follow-up
questions easier. On the other hand, some people are more honest when fill-
ing out an anonymous survey. You can also use an Internet survey. Think
about whom you’re going to survey to determine which method is best.
Keep the following tips in mind to encourage high-quality responses:
 Keep the length of your survey to a minimum. The longer the survey,
the less likely customers are to complete it. Respect your customers’
time by keeping the questions short and relevant.
 Give people taking the survey a good estimate of how long it will take
to complete. This way, they can plan to take the survey when they have
time to complete it in one sitting.
 Use multiple pages for long surveys. Splitting up a long survey makes
people more likely to complete it, because long single-page surveys tend
to scare people off.
 Let survey respondents know about your privacy policy and how
you’ll use the information you collect.
 Offer some kind of reward for completing the survey, such as a 
gift card or a chance to win a valuable prize. At the very least, let 
customers know how the survey will benefit them.
Figure 6-2 shows a sample customer survey.
Using focus groups properly
A focus group can be an extremely useful tool for finding the voice of the cus-
tomer. Focus groups are basically interviews with several people at the same
time (usually 6 to 12 people). The interaction between the members of the
group can be much more informative than interviews done one at a time.
Conducting a focus group has four major steps:
90
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

1. Plan for the focus group.
Based on the major objectives of the focus group, determine who should
be in the group. When you ask a consumer to participate, be sure to let
him know how his input will help you create a better product. Plan for
the meeting to be no more than one or two hours long. Make sure you
have a comfortable location such as a conference room. Prepare
nametags for the participants and provide appropriate refreshments.
2. Develop the questions.
Create no more than five or six questions. Review beforehand what
issues each question addresses. The questions should be open-ended to
encourage answers that you may not have considered. Make sure that
the questions aren’t leading or biased in any way. Examples of good
questions to ask include the following:
• What need did you have that caused you to buy from us in the 
first place?
• How did our products or services help you meet your needs?
• What do you currently like about buying from us?
• How could buying from us be better?
• What other related products or services do you buy from other
vendors?
3. Perform the interviews.
Review the purpose of the focus group with the participants and make
sure they understand the ground rules. Consider the following guidelines:
• Stay focused on the objectives.
• Keep on the agenda to maintain momentum.
• Get closure on all the questions.
Record each session, and make sure the participants know that you’re
recording. Also, call on members who are less talkative to ensure that
one or two people don’t dominate the meeting. Be sure to thank every-
one for participating after all the questions have been answered.
4. Analyze the data.
Review the collected data to look for answers that didn’t provide useful
information or that brought up questions that you should address in the
next session (usually with a different group). Pay careful attention to
data that challenges assumptions that you had before; it may prove 
valuable in pointing out erroneous assumptions you had about your 
customers’ wants and needs.
91
Chapter 6: Detecting the Voice of the Customer in Quality Issues

Tracking with a CRM system
Most organizations have a process for tracking their interactions with
prospects and customers. Typically called a customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) system, this process can provide you with a wealth of informa-
tion on the wants and needs of not only your customers, but also potential
customers. A good CRM system can help you track and analyze the VOC
(voice of the customer) intelligence derived from the hundreds or thousands
of contacts your organization has with customers and prospects.
Most organizations implement CRM systems to track sales-related informa-
tion such as leads and prospects. These systems are designed to help the
marketing and sales teams manage the sales process from the initial contact
with the customer to when a sale is made. Because a major part of their job
involves talking to the customer, sales or marketing employees should collect

as much information as possible about the customers’ wants and needs.
Marketing and sales teams can then share information with the design and
production teams to ensure that your products and services more closely
meet the needs of the customer.
By purposely tracking customer quality issues at the point of interaction with
the customer, an organization can
 Provide quick feedback on quality issues that arise in the field
 Track feedback on issues that may not have resulted in a service call but
are irritating to the customer
 Track customer buying patterns to see possible changes in customer
needs
 Collect information on competitors’ offerings
Borrowing from what competitors got right
Although plagiarism is a bad thing in writing books, there’s no shame in
incorporating the best practices of your competitors into your quality
process. You should never break the law or do anything unethical, but being
on the lookout for ideas that you can use to improve your business is always
a good idea. Sam Walton, the founder of the largest corporation in the United
States, has been quoted as saying that “stealing shamelessly” from competi-
tors was key to Wal-Mart’s success. What he meant was that he had to be
constantly on the lookout for good ideas wherever he could find them.
Check out these ways to find out what your competitors are doing right:
 Talk to customers who’ve looked at your competitors’ products.
 For retail organizations, shop at their stores.
 Purchase your competitors’ products to analyze how they’re made.
 Review their marketing material — some companies, in their desire to
impress prospects, tell more than they should.
 Use some of the same suppliers your competitors use.
Examining other ways to seek 
feedback and information
You can hear the voice of the customer by using a number of different tools
and techniques. In addition to the techniques in the previous sections, some
common methods include the following:
93
Chapter 6: Detecting the Voice of the Customer in Quality Issues

 Customer complaints: If you have a process that customers use to docu-
ment complaints, you have a great source of information about what
your customers want. Although complaints can be difficult to take, the
sooner you hear about them, the sooner you can act.
 Field reports: Anyone who comes into contact with customers should
have a way to report back any tidbits of information learned. This group
includes salespeople, support technicians, and even executives.
 Observation: Observing customers in the act of using your product or
service is a great way to find out about your quality. Ask a customer if
you can watch while he or she uses your product. Customers may not
tell you everything in an interview or survey — not because they mean
to leave anything out, but because they just can’t think of everything.
You may not think to ask the right questions until you actually see cus-
tomers in action. As processes change over time, people use products
and services in ways that differ from the original intended use. The most
important question you can ask while observing is why?
 One-on-one interviews: Sometimes all you have to do is ask. Some 
customers are too shy or too busy to contact you with problems, but
they can turn into fountains of information if you just take the time to sit
down and talk to them. Interviews can be highly structured, with a list of
predetermined questions, or they can be informal chats. Your questions
will be similar to those you present to a focus group but possibly tai-
lored to the individual whom you’re interviewing.
Tap into all your resources. Make sure you talk with any employees who
share demographics similar to those of your end customers.
 Specifications: Good specifications, of course, can tell you exactly what
customers need. Look for ways to be part of your customers’ specifica-
tion-development process; you may find that some difficult-to-meet
specifications aren’t really necessary and that inexpensive solutions can
give the customers what they need. Ask whether the customers can
work with your design department to help you do a better job.
 Warranty data: Review problems covered under warranty to look for
problem areas in your quality process. Look beyond the repair itself for
glitches in other parts of the production process — glitches that may be
the root causes of the problems.
No matter how you hear the voice of the customer, don’t let what your cus-
tomers tell you fall on deaf ears. Incorporate what you discover by reviewing
your design and production processes and making any changes necessary to
better meet your customers’ needs — your paycheck depends on it!

H
ow can you prepare to meet your quality control goals? How do you
conduct the measurement process? Glad you asked! Just like with any
other journey, you need to know three things: where you’re going, how you
plan to get there, and where you are when you start the journey. In this chap-
ter, we help you figure out where your company is today as you start your
journey down the road to quality by preparing to measure your current qual-
ity process. We discuss the items you need to measure and the processes and
tools available to you to make the journey possible. (Check out Chapter 8 for
details on actually collecting data on your quality process.)
Mapping Out Metrics and 
Measuring Processes
Measurement is the compass you use on your organization’s journey to qual-
ity. A proper measurement process tells you where you’ve been, warns you if
you get off the right track, and lets you know when you hit your goal. The old
management saying “You can’t manage what you can’t measure” is especially
true in quality control.
Before you can measure your current quality process, however, you must
decide on the definitions of the terms you’ll use and how your measurement
process will relate to customer specifications; these definitions are called
metrics. You also must decide on the decision process you want to use 
to accept or reject items that you inspect. You have two basic decision
processes you can use: go/no go and measurement against specifications. 
We explain all these topics in the pages that follow.

Making sense of metrics
How do you determine what to measure within your organization, and what
processes should you use to measure after you decide? The items or processes
that you decide to measure are called metrics. A metric is simply a measured
value; in the quality world, a more precise definition of metric is a standard
measurement of a customer specification to which you can apply a quality
standard. Examples of metrics include the following:
 Dimensions such as length, width, height, and depth
 Number of items produced per hour
 Number of phone calls made in a given period
 Average number of pages written per day
 Lines of code written per hour
A good metric has the following characteristics:
 Someone is ultimately responsible for the outcome of the metric 
(in other words, someone is the owner of the metric).
 It’s clearly defined and understood by everyone involved.
 It’s a measurable part of the process.
 It gives clear indication of whether it’s getting better or worse.
 It’s meaningful to management goals.
 It has meaning to the customer.
Generally speaking, the best metrics to use are those usually considered
“standard” within an industry. (Chapter 2 has more information about 
quality standards.) The following list presents the main advantages of 
using industry standards as your quality metrics:
 The hundreds of other companies in your industry have worked out the
bugs in the standard. Don’t reinvent the wheel if you don’t have to.
 Their definition and standard of use are well defined and understood by
every veteran in your industry. New hires may require less training if
they have experience in your industry.
 Your customers are likely to use the metrics because they are the 
“standard.”
 They make handy benchmarks to compare your performance to others
in your industry. Many trade groups, for example, collect information
from members and make aggregate data available.
96
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Using the appropriate metrics is critical in relaying information about the qual-
ity of your products or services to the customer. For example, if your cus-
tomers require that an item be tough, what does that mean? Should the item be
able to support a certain amount of weight? Over what period of time should it
remain tough? Must it resist chemicals or other environmental hazards? The
metrics you use should clearly communicate the customer’s requirements.
How do you discover the requirements of your customers? Just ask them! See
Chapter 6 for details about the customer’s role in quality issues.
To determine the appropriate metrics for your organization, ask yourself and
your customers the following questions:
 Why is the measurement required? Some attributes are more important
than others; some may have legal ramifications, such as government-
mandated standards.
 What are we going to measure? Length, width, height, diameter, strength?
 How will we measure the item? By hand? By machine?
 What amount of accuracy do we require? We don’t want to be any more
perfect than we need to be, as more accuracy usually equals more cost.
 What will we do with the measurement after we make it? Are there
reporting requirements for the customer or for government agencies?
 How much will it cost to measure? Some measurements cost more than
they’re worth.
 Who will use the measurement? The customer, our quality department,
the design team?
Working with your customers on the answers to these questions will most
likely generate even more questions. You have to take the questions and their
answers into consideration when you design your measurement process. The
goal is to produce a quality plan and to measure the appropriate metrics to
achieve progress on your quality journey.
Putting measurement processes 
under the microscope
After you determine the appropriate metrics for your organization, your next
step is to select the right measuring process. You have two main choices:
 Go/no go: You compare the item or process to a standard, and it either
matches the desired standard or doesn’t. For example, say you want to
find out if a bolt fits within a drilled hole. Either the bolt goes into the
97
Chapter 7: Preparing to Measure Your Current Quality Process

hole (go) or it doesn’t (no go). Go/no go measuring is also known as a
pass/fail test.
 Measurement against specifications: You measure an item to see where
the measurement falls between the largest acceptable size (called the
upper limit) and the smallest acceptable size (called the lower limit). The
measurement results in a value that you can use mathematically to make
judgments about an item or process. For example, you can measure the
number of days it takes to complete a particular tax return.
In the following sections, we provide the details about these processes and
help you select the best process for your organization.
No matter which measurement process you choose, however, it must be
 Reliable: The same measurement tool should give the same results, no
matter who does the measuring or when it takes place. (See “Equipping
Yourself with Tools of the Measurement Trade,” later in this chapter, for
more about measurement tools.)
 Valid: The measuring tool you use must be capable of measuring what
you desire it to measure.
 Standardized: The metrics you use and the data you collect should
follow the norms for your industry so that you can benchmark your
process against others in your industry.
Go/no go measurement
A go/no go measurement test is usually quick and easy, so it’s excellent for
high-production speeds and requires minimal operator training. However,
although go/no go measurement can tell you whether an item conforms to
some specification, it can’t tell you other important information you may
need, such as the following:
 By how much is the item or process off from specification?
 Why doesn’t the item or process meet specification?
 How close is a passing item or process to being unacceptable?
The basic problem with the go/no go test is that it just doesn’t give you
enough information to make improvements in your processes. Because you
can’t use the information mathematically other than for counting bad items
(the only value you have is whether it passed or not), you can’t do statistical
quality control, which we talk about in more detail in Chapter 10.
Therefore, most companies use the go/no go measurement process to check
noncritical specifications, such as the length of a common nail. In these spec-
ifications, the company believes the process works well and the customer’s
requirements are easily met.
98
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Measurement against specifications
To avoid producing products or services containing defects (items not 
conforming to specifications; see Chapter 4), you need to understand your
customers’ specifications and agree within your quality control department
on how to measure successful production. The customer’s requirements are
normally expressed as the attributes to be measured and the tolerance of the
measurements. If the customer’s tolerance is too tight, it may not be cost
effective to manufacture the item or provide the service. If the tolerance is
too loose, the item or service may not meet the customer’s needs.
You can determine the tolerances to focus on in your measuring process in
one of two ways:
 Use the experience of your product designers and manufacturing team
to determine what will work best for you and the customer. Your manu-
facturing team has experience in what types of measurement processes
work best in your environment; your design team can work with the cus-
tomer to ensure that the product design meets the customer’s require-
ments in the most efficient manner.
 Calculate the cost of quality at different tolerance levels to find the opti-
mum cost. (See Chapter 4 for items to include in your cost calculations.)
Typically, the lower the tolerance level, the higher the cost.
99
Chapter 7: Preparing to Measure Your Current Quality Process
Beware of relying on error counts
One of the most basic quality measures is to
count the number of errors that occur in your
production processes or during a particular ser-
vice. Although errors are simple and easy mea-
sures to collect, there are several downsides to
relying on error counts for quality control:
 An error count is dependent on how long
(and how hard) operators look for errors.
 Multiple factors can cause a single error
count.
 An operator can count a single problem
multiple times.
 An error count gives little or no information
on the cause of a problem.
 Error counts may not relate a defect to the
value of the loss caused by the defect.
A high error count prompts you to examine your
process (assuming the high count isn’t due to
operator issues). You can attribute an error to
poor design, material failures, requirements that
aren’t understood or well defined, or human
issues with the production process. You need to
do much more work if you’re going to make
good progress on your quality journey.

Selecting the right process for your needs
You have many factors to consider when selecting a measurement 
process for your organization — we present a sampling of these factors 
in the following list:
 Measurement speed required. Go/no go measurement is much faster
than measuring against a specification value.
 Amount of precision required from the measuring tool (see the next
section for more about tools). It’s best to use go/no go when you require
low precision. You typically measure against specifications when you
require higher precision.
 Cost of the measuring equipment. Go/no go measurement devices are
less expensive.
 Skill requirements of the operator. Go/no go measurement devices 
typically require less operator skill.
 Ease of use. The easier the measuring process, the more likely busy 
production people will perform it correctly.
 Versatility of the measuring device. If you’re making lower-volume,
higher-value items, you want a measuring process that can be adjusted
easily for each different part. High-volume items usually can justify a
unique process for each item because the cost of the measuring process
is spread out over more items.
 Uniqueness of the item or process to be measured. A very unique item
may require a very unique measuring process.
 Volume of items or processes to be measured. Go/no go measurement
devices are capable of higher speeds.
 Value of each item or process to be measured. Low-value items are
better suited to go/no go measurement because the cost of being wrong
is less than it is for high-value items.
Equipping Yourself with Tools 
of the Measurement Trade
If you’re going to measure something, you’ll need some sort of device with
which to measure. The quality of your quality control process will be only as
good as the tools you use for measurement. Measurement tools are most
common when making products, but they’re sometimes used to measure the
100
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

end result of a service (for example, the depth of a trench, the height of cut
grass, or the color of paint on a house). Types of measuring devices available
include the following:
 Hand tools
 Gauges
 Coordinate measuring machines
We discuss all these tools in the following sections.
Getting a handle on hand tools
The oldest and most common way to measure anything is with a hand tool.
We’ve all used hand tools to measure something in our lives: a tape measure
to measure a piece of wood, a measuring cup to measure ingredients, a scale
to measure our weight, or a bolt-size gauge for measuring what size bolt we
need for a project. Similar hand tools are used in a production environment
to measure all kinds of product attributes. Hand tools tend to be easy to use
and cheap to operate, and they’re appropriate for many types of quality mea-
surements. They’re best suited for general-purpose applications that require
individual measurements of many different items.
Hand tools come with some disadvantages, however. Their precision can be
less due to human error. The measurements usually take longer to perform as
the operator adjusts the device for each measurement. The tools also require
some amount of skill to operate properly.
Allowing a gauge to do 
your measuring tricks
A common tool used for measuring products is the gauge (or gage). Gauges
are measuring devices designed for a more specific measuring purpose than
hand tools. The term gauge is used for most any device that measures a phys-
ical property such as length, diameter, thickness, pressure, and so on. You
can apply the use of gauges either during the production process or as part
of an inspection process after production.
You can use gauges by hand, or they can be part of an automated process.
They require less skill than hand tools, because the operator usually sets up
the gauge so he can quickly put the part into place for measurement. Once
101
Chapter 7: Preparing to Measure Your Current Quality Process

constructed, the gauge allows the operator to record data quickly and with a
high degree of accuracy.
In the following sections, we present different kinds of gauges, help you
select the best gauge for your needs, and explain how to set up a gauge.
Surveying types of gauges
You can utilize a gauge for just about any application you can think of.
Common types of gauges include the following:
 Air (or pneumatic) gauges measure changes in air flow or pressure to
provide measurements such as thickness, internal or external diameter,
roundness, bore, and taper. You can use air gauges in high-volume pro-
duction environments where accuracy and speed are important.
 Bore and ID gauges measure the internal diameter of holes or cylinders;
they can be mechanical, electronic, or pneumatic.
 Calipers measure the distance between two points — usually for 
determining thickness, length, or diameter. You can also use calipers 
to measure the distance between teeth on a gear.
 Depth gauges measure the depth of indentations or holes in a product.
 Electronic gauges use an electronic probe to measure the distance or
displacement by physical touch using a contact or stylus.
 Fixed gauges or fixed-limit gauges have fixed dimensions that you com-
pare to the product being made. The product either passes or fails
based on the comparison; you don’t use fixed gauges to make actual
measurements. You can use these gauges to measure thickness, inside
or outside diameter, length, width, and so on. Fixed gauges work best in
situations that require a quick and cheap inspection of items.
 Gauge blocks are tools that calibrate gauges. They’re made of special
material, such as hardened steel or ceramic, and built to various toler-
ances, dependent upon the intended application.
 Mechanical gauges measure the movement of a sensor — such as a
spindle, stem, or slide — to determine a measurement.
Picking the right gauge for your products
As you can see from the list in the previous section, you have a tremendous
number of gauges available; so, how do you pick the right one for the job?
Consider the following questions when selecting a gauge:
102
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

 What is it that you need to measure? You first need to select a gauge
that can perform the measurement you need. Measuring length requires
a different gauge than measuring the inside diameter of a cylinder, for
example. You may want a gauge capable of several different types of
measurements, but the more functions a gauge has, the less well it will
probably do each one.
 How important is speed? The greater the number of items produced,
the faster the assembly process. An automated gauge allows for faster
production but comes with additional cost.
A general rule of thumb is that if an inspection using a manual 
gauge requires more than 30 to 40 seconds, you should look at an 
automated gauge.
 How important is accuracy? This question relates directly to the 
tolerances required in your customer specifications (see the section
“Measurement against specifications,” earlier in this chapter, for more
about tolerances). The rule of thumb commonly used is that the measur-
ing device must be ten times more accurate than the specification toler-
ance. Factors such as the speed of the operation, the operator’s skill,
and the environment in which the gauge functions affect accuracy.
Gauges should be calibrated by a lab capable of certifying them to
required tolerances (required by ISO 9001:2000, which we cover in
Chapter 2, and many industries where safety is critical, like aviation).
 What type of environment will you expose the gauge to? If used on a
production line, the gauge may be exposed to dirt and temperature
extremes that can affect its performance.
 Must the gauge go to the item, or can the item go to the gauge? If 
the product is large and/or heavy, you may have to take the gauge to 
the item. A gauge that’s fixed in place is more stable than one that con-
stantly moves around.
 What kind of material is your product made from? If you make your
product out of a soft material, you want a gauge that’s gentle or that
doesn’t physically touch the part, such as an air gauge. You don’t want
the measurement process to change the part in any important way.
 How much can you spend on the gauge? Like anything else you want in
this world, your budget plays a large role in what gauge you select. The
more valuable the item being made or the larger the quantity, the more
you can justify spending on a gauge.
 How skilled are your operators? If you have skilled and motivated oper-
ators, you can implement more complicated gauges. You can improve
skill with training, but motivation can be a tough problem to solve and is
beyond the scope of this book!
103
Chapter 7: Preparing to Measure Your Current Quality Process

Setting up a gauge
You can set up gauges to perform go/no go testing or to provide measure-
ment values to compare against specifications (we cover both processes 
earlier in this chapter). To set up a gauge, use the following basic steps:
1. Start with the desired value in the customer specification and the 
variation allowed.
For example, say that your customer wants a 1/2-inch diameter hole
drilled into a part where the hole can be up to 0.06 inches larger. So, the
largest acceptable hole size is 0.50 + 0.06 inches.
2. Follow the rule of thumb that the measuring device must be ten times
more accurate than the specification tolerance.
In our example, the tolerance is 0.06, so the measuring device must 
be capable of measuring to 0.06 × 10 percent = 0.006 — the measuring
tolerance.
3. Take the measuring tolerance and divide it in half. You subtract this
value from the largest acceptable value, and add the same value to
the smallest acceptable value.
For this step, you take 0.006 ÷ 2 = 0.003. You subtract from the largest
acceptable hole — 0.560 – 0.003 — and you add to the smallest accept-
able hole — 0.500 + 0.003.
4. Any value smaller than the smallest acceptable value or larger than
the largest acceptable value is a no go.
For our example, any hole smaller than 0.503 or larger than 0.557 inches
is a no go.
Your calculations will differ depending on the type of product you want to
measure and the industry you’re in. You can receive standard calculation
instructions from organizations such as the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) to apply to your situation (see Chapter 2 for more about 
ANSI and other quality organizations).
Here are a couple key things to remember about setting up a gauge:
 The product tolerance determines the gauge tolerance.
 Use gauges and tools that support the product specification required by
your customers, not the other way around.
104
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Checking out coordinate 
measuring machines
If you decide that hand-held devices and gauges can’t give you the perfor-
mance you need, you should turn to coordinate measuring machines (CMMs).
They’re expensive, but they can handle much higher volumes of items than
hand tools or gauges.
CMMs are three-dimensional electronic rulers that can accurately measure 
in all three dimensions. You use a CMM to measure a product along several
surfaces by using a probe to determine the coordinates of points along the
surface. CMMs are usually computer controlled and consist of the following
four components:
 The CMM itself
 A measuring probe
 A control or computing system
 Measuring software
You use CMMs in situations that require more flexibility and accuracy than 
a simple gauge can provide. These tools are also easier to automate than a
gauge. They come in a variety of designs and sizes and use a wide array of
probes. They’re best used for dimensional measurement, depth plotting,
imaging, and profile measurement. They’re commonly used in the automo-
tive, aviation, and electronic industries, where high-value parts requiring
strict tolerances are made.
In the following sections, we explain when to use CMMs and what to look for
when you buy one for your organization.
When should you use coordinate measuring machines?
When you need to measure a product, along its surface areas, a CMM may be
your only choice to quickly and accurately take measurements. If your prod-
uct has contours or curved surfaces (such as car exteriors, furniture, and
hand tools), a CMM is your only choice for measuring along the entire surface.
Measuring contoured surfaces requires that you record a massive amount of
data points, which you can’t do efficiently with a hand tool or gauge.
105
Chapter 7: Preparing to Measure Your Current Quality Process

A CMM also provides an additional level of quality assurance. Although many
machines used to make products have the capability to perform measure-
ments on the products they make, a CMM can provide an independent check
of the quality specifications of the products.
The main disadvantages of a CMM are its cost and the training required for
configuration and operation. CMMs are much more expensive than simple
gauges and require specialized training to be set up correctly and operated
effectively. These disadvantages limit CMM use to high-value or high-volume
items; the extra expense over other options is justified due to the value of the
item or because the cost can be spread over lots of items.
How do you select the right coordinate measuring machine?
The criteria for selecting a CMM aren’t complex; you should look for a CMM
that does the following actions or has the following properties:
 Measures quickly enough to keep up with your production process. Be
sure to think about future growth in production rates.
 Is flexible enough for use with the most complex products you manufac-
ture. Review the products you make and compare their requirements to
the capability of the CMM.
 Can handle the largest products you make. Again, consider future
requirements.
 Can interface easily with other computer systems you already have.
 Is appropriate for the material your product is made of. You don’t want
the measurement process to damage your products.
 Has reverse-engineering capabilities. In other words, you can easily
determine how it works with basic engineering skills. This capability 
can save a lot of time if appropriate data isn’t available to set up the
machine.
 Can handle any environmental issues within your facility. You may need
to provide a controlled environment.
You have other options to consider, too, such as the configuration of the
probe arms, the material used to support the CMM, and the cost of support
for the machine. Compare features from different vendors to see what’s avail-
able; your industry trade association may have information on the options
that work best for your type of operation.
CMMs usually last for many years because upgrades to probes and software
can extend their useful lives. Look to buy the best and biggest you can afford
today because it will probably be around for a long time.

Collecting Your Quality Data
In This Chapter
 Walking through the data-collection process
 Searching for the meaning of your data
H
ow do you know if your organization’s quality is good or bad? Do you
know if it’s getting better or worse? Are you meeting your customers’
expectations? The key to answering these questions is collecting and analyz-
ing data. Collection of quality data is critical to developing a quality system
that addresses these questions. You must have data to analyze in order to
determine the effectiveness of your quality process.
Data is valuable because it represents important information about your
processes — factual information, used to reason or make decisions. Data may
give you information about the speed of your process, such as units per hour
or hourly usage of raw material. It may tell you information about the popu-
larity of your product, such as units shipped per week or average inventory
on hand. But what should really interest you is what the data tells you about
the quality of your production or service-delivery process, such as first-time
quality or defects per million units produced. With the right data, you can
zero in on problems in your production process that cause you to make bad
items, waste resources, and disappoint your customers.
Data also can surprise you or clarify a situation that was previously unclear.
Many times, casual observations become accepted facts when repeated
enough times, with no scientific analysis to validate their accuracy (known 
as anecdotal evidence). Without good data, you may think your quality is fine
when it’s actually getting worse.
In this chapter, we show you how to collect and analyze the data you need 
to improve the quality of your product or service and your production or 
service-delivery process. With the information you find here, you can manage
with facts instead of guessing based on anecdotes and assumptions.

Check out Chapter 7 for details on preparing to measure your current quality
process; it contains information about metrics, measurement processes, and
measurement tools. Chapter 9 discusses the importance of sampling in data
collection.
Planning and Instituting a 
Data-Collection Process
How do you start collecting data about quality? How do you know what data
to collect? You not only want to collect the right data for your organization
and industry, but also minimize the time and cost required to collect it. Data
collection can be time consuming and expensive, so a little planning up front
can save you time and money in the long run.
To start your organization’s data-collection process, identify the business
goals and objectives you intend to meet by collecting the data. Here are some
important questions to ask of your organization before getting started:
 What data will you collect? What data do you have now that your 
organization can use?
 Why are you collecting the data? Are you acting in response to a 
customer’s issue or as part of a business goal to serve more demanding
customers? (See Chapter 6 for more about the customer’s involvement
in quality issues.)
 Who will collect the data? Is training necessary for existing employees?
Do you need to hire new people to collect the data?
 Where will you collect the data, and how will you report it?
 How frequently will you collect and report the data? Do you need to 
collect and report the data in real-time?
 How will you verify the quality of the data?
 How much will the data collection cost?
We cover these questions and more in the following sections.
Knowing exactly what data 
you’re looking for
The first phase of the data-collection process is figuring out what data you
need to collect for your production or service-delivery process. You have
many options for getting started, some of which are more effective than
108
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

others, depending on your organization and industry. The following list pre-
sents some options you may consider to figure out what data to collect:
 Gather anecdotal evidence
 Enact one-change-at-a-time testing
 Perform a design of experiments
 Create a SIPOC map
The goal of this phase is to determine the specific metrics you’re going to
measure so you know which tools you need to perform the data collection
(see Chapter 7 for more about metrics and tools).
Anecdotal evidence
As you might imagine, guessing isn’t an effective way to determine what data
you need to collect for your organization. Even using anecdotal evidence (a
form of guessing) to determine what data to collect causes you to spend time
on processes that really aren’t problems or on factors that are out of your
control. For example, you may have a suspicion (anecdotal evidence) that
the delivery time for the service you provide is an important metric to mea-
sure. Maybe no one bothered to ask the customers, who are really more con-
cerned about the accuracy of the service than the delivery time.
The only good use for anecdotal evidence is as a “sanity check” for the data
you do collect, not as a process for determining what data to collect. Past
experience may alert you to data that doesn’t “smell” right, which should 
be a signal to dig deeper into the process to see whether the data collected 
is correct.
One-change-at-a-time testing
A simple method you can use to determine what data to collect for your 
organization is to set up small experiments that allow you to change possible
quality factors one at a time to see what affects they have on quality — a
process called one-change-at-a-time testing. When an experiment identifies an
attribute of your process that affects quality, you can begin to measure that
attribute as part of your quality control process. For example, you might add
more yeast to your pizza-dough recipe to see whether you can improve the
quality of the dough. If the small change in the amount of yeast has an impact
on the quality of the dough, the amount of yeast included is a good candidate
for a quality measure.
Although only slightly better than guessing, one-change-at-a-time testing 
can provide useful information on what factors have the biggest impact on
quality, and at a reasonable cost. The factors with the biggest impact are the
factors you want to spend time and money on to measure.
109
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

With this method, the temptation is to stop the experiments when you iden-
tify the first significant affect on quality. If you stop too soon, however, you
may not identify situations where changing one attribute has a significant
effect on a different attribute; the two attributes may work together in some
way to impact quality.
The design of experiments
A design of experiments (DOE) process improves upon the one-change-at-a-
time process (see the previous section) by planning out all possible depen-
dencies in advance. By defining in advance what experiments to perform in
the DOE process, you put yourself in a position to catch multiple attributes
that work together to affect the quality of your product or service.
Inexpensive software packages for performing a DOE are available. Use your
favorite Internet search engine to see what you can find.
To perform a DOE, use the following steps. For this process, we stick with the
pizza-dough example from the previous section. You want to sell your pizza
dough as a mix for consumers to use at home, and, of course, you want to
make the best possible mix. Many factors may affect the production of your
pizza dough mix, but for this example, you’re concerned only with the recipe.
1. Identify the input and output factors that the experiments will measure.
Start with a limited number of factors that you think will impact the
quality of your pizza dough mix: flour, yeast, and salt.
2. Define for each input value a number of levels for which the output
value is known.
Your current standard recipe calls for 500 grams of flour, 30 grams of
yeast, and 2.5 grams of salt. You then need to decide how to vary each of
these factors. For example, you can vary flour from a low of 400 grams to
a high of 600 grams; yeast from 20 grams to 40 grams; and salt from 1.5
grams to 3.5 grams.
3. Create an experiment plan that includes the input-level values defined.
In this case, you try different combinations of flour, yeast, and salt, mix
and bake the crust, and then have a taste tester judge the quality of the
crust on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being best).
4. Perform the experiments for each input level and measure the output.
In other words, you create a matrix of the selected combinations of input
values and levels. For instance, Mix 1 — with 400 grams of flour, 20 grams
of yeast, and 1.5 grams of salt — yields a quality score of 7. Mix 2 — with
500 grams of flour, 20 grams of yeast, and 1.5 grams of salt — yields a
score of 6. Mix 3 — with 500 grams of flour, 40 grams of yeast, and 2.5
grams of salt — yields a score of 8.
110
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

5. Look for differences between the output values for the different levels
of the input changes.
These differences are due either to the input value by itself or to the
input value acting in combination with another input. Mix 3 received the
best score, but you may want to do more experiments to determine
whether other factors play a role in the quality of the dough.
Make sure that each department involved in the process of creating your
product or developing your service is involved in identifying the input values
and levels (design, production, shipping, service, and so on). For the DOE
method to work, you must perform an experiment for each possible combina-
tion of input values and levels. If this seems impractical for your business,
you may need to focus on the values you think are most critical; however, the
fewer experiments you do, the closer you get to guessing.
The SIPOC map
Creating a SIPOC map allows you to determine which data to collect by identi-
fying all the key stakeholders and activities for which you should be collect-
ing quality data. A SIPOC map, short for “suppliers, inputs, process, outputs,
and customers,” forces you to consider each important area of your business
so that you don’t overlook any opportunities for quality improvement.
To create a SIPOC map, follow these steps (we stick with the pizza dough
example we’ve used in the past couple sections):
1. Diagram the top five to ten steps required to create your product or
service.
In the pizza dough example, these steps may be the following:
• Receive the raw materials from suppliers.
• Measure the ingredients.
• Mix the ingredients together.
• Fill the mix boxes.
• Prepare the mix boxes for shipping.
• Ship the mix boxes to the customer.
2. Make a list of all the outputs of the process.
In the example, the output is simply the filled box of pizza dough mix.
3. Make a list of all the inputs required for the process to operate.
You need the raw ingredients, boxes for the mix, and shipping cartons.
111
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

4. Make a list of all the customers that receive the outputs of the process.
Your customers may include retail stores, distribution centers, and
restaurants.
5. Make a list of all the suppliers that provide the inputs to the process.
List the firms that supply the ingredients, boxes, shipping cartons, and
so on.
6. Review the map with all your stakeholders to verify that what you’ve
created is correct.
Show the map to customers, suppliers, and employees for verification.
A completed SIPOC map allows you to manage expectations and clearly 
communicate the answers to the following questions to your team:
 What are the inputs required for the process to be successful?
 Who provides the inputs that you need?
 What are the steps required to create the product or service?
 What’s the end result of the process?
 And, most importantly, who is the process for?
With the answers to these questions, you can focus on measuring the 
critical parts of your production process — in other words, you know 
what data to collect!
Working out the data-collection details
Important questions to answer are who should collect the data, when to 
collect the data, and how to collect the data. Although details vary from
industry to industry, the following guidelines apply to most situations:
 Employees closest and most familiar to the process — typically the
people producing the item — should collect the data.
 Collect the data as quickly as possible to avoid changes in subsequent
processes. For example, if an item isn’t measured until after packaging,
and the item gets damaged during packaging, how will you know what
caused the item to be defective?
 Look for the tools you have available to determine how you collect the
data (see Chapter 7 for more about measurement tools). If the process
can justify the expense, a fully automated data-collection system is usu-
ally your best choice (see the later section “Absorbing the costs of data
collection” for details). For many processes, however, simple pencil-and-
paper collection can be very effective.
112
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Ensuring that everyone measures 
the same way
The purpose of a quality control process is to detect and eliminate variations
in the production process. You also want to make sure that each person
involved in the quality process measures quality in the same manner. But
how do you make sure that any variation you detect isn’t in the measurement
process itself?
The process of ensuring that everyone measures in the same way is called
gauge (or gage) repeatability and reproducibility, also known as gauge R&R.
The process, which you can use with any type of measurement process and
device, is a statistical tool that allows you to measure the amount of variation
caused by the production process or the measurement process. It considers
both the tool used for measuring (repeatability) and the people performing
the measurements (reproducibility).
You should perform a gauge R&R
 Before putting a new measuring device into production (see Chapter 7
for more about measuring devices)
 Whenever a new operator or inspector begins performing measurements
 As part of your data-collection training and certification processes
 At least once a year to make sure your measurement process is still valid
In the following sections, we go into detail about what gauge R&R examines;
we show you the importance of taking samples; and we walk you through the
steps of actually performing the process.
Examining the elements of a consistent collection process
You have six ways to look at your measuring processes to judge how 
well they work:
 Repeatability: Can the same operator measure the same item 
multiple times with the same measurement device and get the 
same result each time?
 Reproducibility: Can different operators measure the same item 
with the same measurement device and get the same result?
 Stability: Will the measurement process produce the same result 
over time with the same sample?
113
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

 Bias (or accuracy): How close are the operators to the actual value?
 Discrimination: Do you have the ability to tell things apart?
 Linearity: How consistent is the measuring process over the entire
range of possible values? In other words, is the accuracy the same for
both large and small measurements?
When you talk about measurement, you also must consider the difference
between accuracy and precision. In your quest to improve your organiza-
tion’s quality measures, you should aim to improve both accuracy and preci-
sion in your data-collection process. Accuracy is how close you are to a true
value; precision is the number of digits used to express a number.
Four combinations of accuracy and precision exist:
 Accurate but not precise
 Precise but not accurate
 Accurate and precise
 Not accurate and not precise
See Figure 8-1 for an illustration of the differences.
How sensitive should your measurement tool be? The rule of thumb is that
the measuring tool should measure 10 times the precision called for in the
specification. For example, if the spec calls for the item to be 5.2 inches long
(measured to the tenth of an inch), the measuring tool must be able to mea-
sure out to hundredths, or to 0.01.
Taking standard samples
To prepare for a gauge R&R test, you need precisely measured samples that
you can use to test operators who will use the measuring devices in your
organization.

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

An expert operator should perform the sample measurements under ideal
conditions. After the collection of these samples, you’ll have what’s known 
as a standard measurement. You should use a minimum of 30 samples; some-
where between 30 and 100 samples gives you good results (see Chapter 9 for
more about sampling).
Testing the data collectors
To carry out the gauge R&R, you test your measurement operators by having
them measure the samples multiple times to see how close the results come
to the standard measurements and how consistent the operators are in the
measuring process (see the previous sections). You look for four results
when implementing the gauge R&R test:
 How consistent the operator is in measuring the same sample
 How often the operator gets the standard measurement
 How consistent multiple operators are amongst themselves
 How often the operators as a group get the standard measurement
Use Figure 8-2 as a starting point for developing a chart to perform a gauge
R&R test. The example is set up for attribute data (such as pass/fail or yes/no),
but you can easily modify it to use variable data (quantitative data, such as 1.4
or 25.343). See Chapter 4 for a discussion of attribute versus variable data and
how to convert attribute data to variable data.
A spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel makes the calculations of a
gauge R&R test much easier and less prone to error.
Have each operator measure each standard sample at least twice. Make sure
you randomly select the samples so that the operators don’t know which
samples they’re measuring. Record the measurements by using your gauge
R&R form.
After the operators measure all the samples and you have the form filled out,
you’re ready to make your calculations:
1. Calculate the variation for each operator by counting the number of
samples for which the operator gets the same measurement value and
dividing this number by the number of samples.
For example, in Figure 8-2, Operator #1 has different results for samples
1, 6, and 22. You calculate his variation by dividing the number of similar
measurements (22) by the total number of samples (25). His operator
score is 88 percent, or a 12 percent variation.
115
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

2. Calculate the variation for each operator versus the standard by
counting the number of samples for which the operator gets the 
standard measurement value and dividing this number by the 
number of samples.
Operator #1 has different results for samples 1, 6, 9, 22, and 23. You
divide the number of standard measurements (20) by the total number
of samples (25). His operator score versus the standard is 80 percent, or
a 20 percent variation.

3. Calculate the variation between the operators by counting the number
of samples for which the operators get the same measurement value
and dividing this number by the number of samples.
In Figure 8-2, the operators have different results for samples 1, 6, 13,
and 22. You divide the number of similar measurements (21) by the total
number of samples (25). The variation between operators’ scores is 84
percent, or a 16 percent variation.
4. Calculate the variation between the operators versus the standard by
counting the number of samples for which the operators get the same
standard measurement value and dividing this number by the number
of samples.
The operators have different results from the standard for samples 1, 6,
9, 13, 22, and 23. You divide the number of standard measurements by
the total number of samples (25). The variation between operators’
scores is 76 percent, or a 24 percent variation.
Analyzing the gauge R&R
What do the values from the gauge R&R test mean? A rule of thumb is that 
a variation of up to 10 percent means that the collection process is working
fine and that the production process is to blame for any variation. If the 
variation between measurements is greater than 10 percent but less than 
30 percent, the data may be acceptable, depending on the costs involved 
and the importance of the collection being performed. Variation between
operators is probably due to differences in skill and/or training gaps that
your organization needs to address.
Confirming the quality of your data
Just as the production of your product or service has a quality control
process, so must your data-collection process. Think of it as this book’s 
quality-in-quality screen, much like a television’s picture-in-picture screen.
The quality of your data has a major impact on actions you take as a result 
of your quality control process, so you need to make sure that your data 
goes through a review process to ensure its accuracy. Although you have 
no way to guarantee that your data will always be 100 percent correct, you
can take comfort in the fact that a little quality control goes a long way
toward catching errors before your organization uses bad data to make 
quality control decisions.
117
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

Poor decisions based on inaccurate or out-of-date data have serious 
consequences for your quality control effort. Alas, errors happen as long 
as human beings are involved in the data collection process. Some common
data-collection errors include the following:
 Measurement taken incorrectly
 Value misread from the measuring device
 Numbers transposed as they’re recorded
 Miscounting
 Handwriting that’s hard to read
 Values entered incorrectly into the computer
 Data processed too late to make corrections to the process
Some of these errors simply require more care on the part of the collector,
but you can’t always rely on people taking great care. Therefore, we provide
you with additional options for ensuring that you have the correct data
during and after its collection in the following sections.
Checking out check sheets
One tool you can use to ensure that you get the right data is a check sheet. A
check sheet is a structured form used for collecting and analyzing data. It can
be as simple as a tally sheet, where you make tick marks to record a count of
when an error happens, or it can be as complex as a chart of the data that
forms as data collectors gather it.
To create and use a simple check sheet, perform the following steps:
1. Determine what event you want to count.
You may perform a simple pass/fail test (is the label in the right spot?), or
you may check to see whether a measurement is within specifications.
2. Define what warrants a check mark.
In most cases, you’re counting the number of failures.
3. Decide when you’ll collect the data and for how long.
For instance, you may collect data for ten minutes during each shift.
4. Design the check sheet to collect the data.
Be sure to make it simple to use, and include space for all the data you
need to collect. Each sheet should be uniquely identified and should
record information such as the date, time, person collecting, process
under review, batch number, check-sheet number, and so on.
5. Record the data by making simple check marks.
118
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Make sure that your data collectors are trained and understand the process.
Don’t assume that anything is obvious.
Check sheets can take many forms:
 A simple check sheet, as shown in Figure 8-3, records each error as it
occurs. List the errors you want to record in the column labeled “Error”
and place a tick mark in the column labeled “Tally” each time the error
occurs. When you’re done collecting data, count the number of tick
marks in the Tally row and put that number in a row under the column
marked “Total.” Divide the value in the Total column by the number of
items made during the time you collected the data, and place that value
in the column labeled “Percentage.”
 Some check sheets allow you to record not only when an error occurs,
but also where the error occurs.
You can make a diagram of the item a collector is checking and create
space for the user to place check marks at the locations of the errors.
You also can have a column for each possible location on the check
sheet, as shown in Figure 8-4. The “Total” column notes the total number
of errors that occurred at the different locations.

Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

Taking time to compare and review
You can perform simple compare-and-review checks to confirm the quality of
your data:
 Have someone other than the person collecting the data review the
data. Anyone familiar with the quality process can perform this role.
 Compare your data with data generated by other processes or 
systems. For example, production quantity should make sense when
compared to the amount of raw material or parts purchased.
 Perform some basic statistics on the data to see whether it falls in line
with data previously collected. This can work for characteristics such
as minimum and maximum values, averages, frequencies, and so on.
 After you load the data into whatever system you use to analyze it,
have a person involved in collecting the data review the analysis to
see if it matches what the person collected.
Anything you find outside of what you expected requires further investiga-
tion. If a result points to a quality problem, you have a head start on doing
something about it. If you identify bad data, you have time to correct the data
before it causes problems of its own.

Absorbing the costs of data collection
After you get excited about all the data-collection opportunities out there and
how they can improve your quality control processes, you find yourself back
at the dreary hangout of your company’s financial executives: the bottom
line. There is, of course, a cost associated with collecting quality data. If you
collect data manually, the majority of the cost is in labor. The quality control
manager may designate one employee to collect quality data and assign an
additional person as required, or he may use production employees, which
makes them less productive in their primary jobs of producing items (see
Chapter 5 for more on the quality control manager). If you key the data into a
software program for analyzing purposes (see the previous section), you add
time and cost. If you use an automated data-collection system, you incur a
cost in equipment and training.
Factors to look at when calculating the cost of a data-collection process or
system include the following:
 Labor (don’t forget to include benefits, taxes, and other costs)
 Materials (such as raw materials that go into a product)
 Operating expenses (such as electricity, water, and gas)
 Machine costs (for the machines used to make a product)
121
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data
Cowering at the cost of poor data quality
Erroneous data costs you money, so the sooner
you can correct an error, the less negative
impact the error will have. To scare you straight,
we’ll introduce the cost of poor data quality
(COPDQ), which is similar to the cost of poor
quality (COPQ; see Chapter 2). Here are some
factors that determine your COPDQ:
 Cost to find the error
 Cost to fix the error
 Cost of wasted effort due to bad data
 Lost production of workers fixing data prob-
lems rather than producing products
Although the COPDQ can be difficult to calcu-
late, doing so gives you a better idea of how
important good quality data is to your organiza-
tion. A good way to determine your COPDQ is the
“rule of ten”: A task costs ten times more when
the data isn’t perfect compared to when it is per-
fect. For example, if a task costs $1.00 when the
data is perfect, you can assume it will cost
$10.00 if the data is flawed.

Like any other cost, the cost of your quality control process needs to be fig-
ured into the cost of your products. When done correctly, the cost of quality
control is less than the cost of selling poor-quality products.
An automated data-collection system may save you money in the long run.
You get a break with labor costs, and you gain from having more timely data
and possibly higher-quality data. (Machines with jobs such as barcode read-
ing are much more accurate at recording data than humans writing down or
keying in data.) Additional benefits of automation include
 Improved efficiency in the production and quality control processes
 Higher employee morale due to a reduction in menial tasks
 Increased accuracy of the data collected
 Higher customer satisfaction because you can give customers better 
visibility into the process
Making Sense of Your Data
We doubt that you’re planning on collecting quality data just for fun; if so,
we’re sure you’ll find a few companies at your doorstep with lists of tasks for
you to jump into. More likely, your goal is to turn the data you collect into
meaningful information that you can use to improve the quality of your pro-
duction processes or service deliveries. In the following sections, we discuss
different techniques you can use to whip your data into shape and begin
turning it into useful information. Keep in mind that coding may require you
122
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 
Know where your data comes from!
Never forget that your quality effort is only as
good as the data that goes into it. No matter how
sophisticated your analysis process is, it still
relies on good source data to work properly. A
quote from the book Some Economic Factors in
Modern Life (Lond), written by Sir Josiah Stamp
and published in 1929, sums up the problem
nicely:
“The government are very keen on amass-
ing statistics. They collect them, add them,
raise them to the n’th power, take the cube
root and prepare wonderful diagrams. But
you must never forget that every one of
those figures comes in the first instance
from the village watchman, who just puts
down what he damn well pleases.”
Some things never change!

to do some work before you even collect your data. (For more information
about fully evaluating your data with different statistical methods, see
Chapters 9 and 10.)
Coding the data
Coding data as you collect it helps you identify patterns or problems in your
data. Coding is a way to organize and categorize raw data into useful informa-
tion. It allows you to put data into buckets so you can analyze it in such a
way that you compare apples to apples. Codes can be numbers, letters, or
tags of three or four letters such as LNG, SHT, SCR (long, short, scratch).
To code your data, you need to define the coding units for each characteris-
tic that you’re measuring. (See the section “Knowing exactly what data you’re
looking for,” earlier in this chapter, to figure out what to collect.) You may use
a scale of numbers such as one through five or simply a pass/fail code. The
different types of scales you can use include the following:
 Binary: One of two values (pass/fail, true/false, and so on)
 Nominal: Names or numbers given to label something (colors, model,
and so on)
 Ordinal: A rank order where the distance between any two values can
vary (for example, you can rank your machine operators in order of 
percentage of parts made right the first time, but the difference in the
percentage between each operator will vary)
 Interval: A rank order where the distance between any two values can’t
vary (a ranking such as 1, 2, 3, 4)
 Ratio: A measurement such as weight or length
You can set up your coding scheme after you review your data to see what
sort of coding makes sense, or you can set up the coding scheme in advance
(as you would in a survey). Either way, you’ll make adjustments to the coding
scheme as you gain experience with collecting the data.
Using pivot tables
A simple, yet powerful, technique for analyzing quality data is the pivot table.
A pivot table allows you to summarize and analyze large amounts of data in
lists and tables. You call it a pivot table because you can rotate the row and
column headings around the main data area in order to analyze different
views of the data.
123
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

You also can use a pivot table to quickly identify which quality problems
occur most often; this is called a Pareto analysis (see Chapter 9 for more
about this type of analysis). It makes sense to identify these problem children
and focus your resources on fixing them.
To create a pivot table, you enter different dimensions of the data in question
as rows or columns of a table. You total and display the remaining dimensions
as numbers in the cells of the table. You add cross-tabulations and summaries
to the resulting table of numbers and generate graphs of your conclusions. A
pretty bone-dry process, huh? Allow us to incorporate some technology.
Pivot tables are inexpensive to use because most firms already use Microsoft
Excel. The tables are available in Excel 5.0 or later, and you can find them in
most other spreadsheet software. You can create a typical quality control
pivot table with Microsoft Excel by using the following steps:
1. Enter your data into the spreadsheet, with each row representing a
single defect and each column representing an attribute of the defect.
For example, you may record the date, the workstation, and the type of
defect in a single row for each defect found.
2. Select a single cell in the data.
3. From the menu, select Data ‡ Pivot Table ‡ Pivot Chart Report.
4. Follow the instructions in the wizard to create the pivot-table template.
5. Drag and drop the fields onto the pivot table.
You can now look at the data from different perspectives. You also can create
graphs from the pivot table by using the charting feature in Excel. See Figure 8-5
for an example of data you can enter into Excel and a pivot table you can gener-
ate from this data.

Developing useful data charts
Charts and graphs can be very powerful means of communication. You can
use them to spot relationships within your collected quality data that may
not be obvious (we cover spotting relationships in data later in this chapter).
Otherwise, quality charts are useful for spotting relationships or patterns 
in the data that may give you insight into the quality of your production
process. A pattern may alert you to an issue with a particular machine 
operator, for example, or a reduction in productivity at a certain time of the
day. Charts give you a visual representation of data to help you see trends,
outliers, and frequency.
You have several different types of charts at your disposal to help you
manage your quality process. In Chapters 9 and 10, we get into the details of
quality charts; in the following sections, we give you an overview of the types
of charts used in quality control.
Histograms
A histogram is a commonly used graph for showing frequency distributions. A
frequency distribution shows you how often each unique value in a set of data
occurs. Therefore, a histogram can show you how consistently a production
process stays within a desired range of values; the more the high-frequency
attributes fall within customer specifications, the better. You can use a his-
togram to discover whether your production process is capable of meeting
customer specifications consistently. It works best when you use it to sum-
marize large amounts of data that you’ve collected over a period of time.
In addition to showing the relative frequency of each data value, a 
histogram shows
 The overall shape of the data (is the data bell-shaped or flat?)
 The variation in the data
 The distribution of the data
To create a histogram, follow these steps:
1. Decide what you want to measure.
Your data can be attributes such as size, time, weight, temperature, or
speed, for example.
2. Collect a large set of data — at least 50 to 100 data samples.
Be sure to collect the data as randomly as possible. Chapter 9 has full
details on sampling.
125
Chapter 8: Collecting Your Quality Data

3. Plot the data.
The Y-axis should show the frequency and the X-axis should show the
different attribute values. Figure 8-6 gives you an example of a histogram
that focuses on the frequency of defects.
Pareto charts
A Pareto chart is a specialized histogram (see the previous section) used to
group and organize your data so you can quickly identify the best opportuni-
ties for improvement. Its main usefulness is to display the relative impor-
tance of each problem in a quick, simple, visual format. In other words, a
Pareto chart helps you find the “low-hanging fruit” that you can easily pick 
to make improvements to your quality process.
A Pareto chart works by showing you the relative size or frequency of a 
quality problem, which allows you to focus on the things that will have the
greatest impact if fixed. Its value is based on the 80/20 rule: 20 percent of
your production inputs cause 80 percent of your quality output problems
(see the nearby sidebar for more about this “Pareto Principle”).
To create a Pareto chart, follow these steps:
1. List the quality factors you’re interested in.
2. Measure the quality factors by using the same unit of measure for
each factor (such as defects per 1,000 items).
3. Order the quality factors according to their measurement from the
smallest to the largest, and plot the data.
4. Work on the quality factor that has the biggest impact on the final
quality of the product.

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

The Pareto chart we present in Figure 8-7 shows a range of quality factors for
defects in truck cabs, including scratches, dings, rust, and paint drips. As you
can see, the biggest quality problem is scratches, so you would address it
first. Because scratches, drips, and dings all are pretty high relative to the
other quality issues, you should review the production process to see
whether a common problem in the line is causing them.
Scatter diagrams
A scatter diagram is designed to find a pattern in data or a relationship
between two variables:
 You can record values for a single value, taking samples sequentially
over time. You’re really comparing the measured value with the variable
time. For example, you can record how the size of a hole being drilled
changes over time.
 You can discover if two production variables are related. For example, you
may measure the strength of a wood joint versus the amount of glue used.

Meet the inventor of the Pareto Principle
The Pareto Principle is named after Vilfredo
Pareto, a 19th-century Italian economist. He
observed that 20 percent of the population con-
trolled 80 percent of the wealth in Italy during
his time. Many people later observed a similar
phenomenon in other areas of study. Joseph
Juran, a quality management pioneer in the
1930s, referenced Pareto’s theory in observing
that 20 percent of something is responsible for
80 percent of the result. The 80/20 rule has been
known ever since as the Pareto Principle.

A scatter chart that shows how a value changes over time can graphically
depict things such as the effect of a tool wearing out and help you determine
how frequently to replace the tool. If two variables that you’re comparing are
related, you can see their effect on quality and their optimal values.
To create a scatter diagram, follow these steps:
1. Determine the two variables you want to compare.
2. Plot the value for the variable that you changed (known as the 
independent variable) on the X-axis.
In Figure 8-8, this value is the amount of glue, measured in drops.
3. Plot the value for the measured value (known as the dependent 
variable) on the Y-axis.
This value is joint strength in Figure 8-8.
4. Look for a relationship between the two variables by seeing if you 
can draw a relatively straight line through the points.
In the sample scatter diagram in Figure 8-8, you find a fairly good rela-
tionship between the amount of glue used and the strength of the joint;
the more glue used, the stronger the joint.
Control charts
The most commonly used chart in quality control, by most accounts, is the
control chart — an important tool used in statistical quality control (which 
we cover in much more detail in Chapters 9 and 10). A control chart is a vari-
ation of a scatter diagram (see the previous section) that you use to see how
a process changes over time.

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

The process involves determining how large an attribute value can be 
(called the upper control limit [UCL]) and how low the attribute value can 
be (called the lower control limit [LCL]) and still be acceptable to the 
customer. After you test the limits, you measure the attribute over time to 
see how it fluctuates between the upper and lower control limits. You can 
use control charts with any quality attribute that’s important to the customer.
An attribute can be either in control or out of control:
 If the attribute stays between the upper and lower control limits on a
consistent basis, the process is said to be in control.
 If the attribute goes above the upper control limit or below the lower
control limit, the process is said to be out of control. (The process also
can be out of control if the data exhibits some nonrandom pattern,
which we cover in Chapter 10.)
The two most common control charts are known as the X-bar and Range
(or R) charts. They both work by plotting attribute values that result from
samples of multiple measurements taken at a given point in time. A sample
typically consists of measurements of two to ten samples. The X-bar chart
plots the average (arithmetic mean) of the samples, and the R chart plots 
the range between the lowest and highest measured values of the samples.
In the sample X-bar chart in Figure 8-9, you can see the UCL and the LCL with
the averages for each sample taken over time. The attribute value measured
in the chart is the diameter of a hole being drilled, and time is measured in
minutes. In this example, the process is staying in control.

Evaluating Quality with Statistics
In This Chapter
 Knowing why statistics are important for quality control
 Arming your organization with sampling and Pareto analysis tools
 Checking out the uses of correlation, regression analysis, and variance
T
he old management saying “you can’t manage what you can’t measure”
holds just as true in the world of quality control. Statistics are the mea-
surement tool you need to manage the creation of your product or service. 
In this chapter, we explain how you can use statistics as the language to 
measure and evaluate the quality of your product or service. We discuss 
the following statistical concepts in relation to quality control:
 Sampling: The idea that you don’t have to measure every item you pro-
duce to be able to judge the overall quality of your production process.
 Pareto analysis: A Pareto chart is a visual tool you can use to gain a 
general understanding of your production process (see Chapter 8 for 
an introduction to Pareto charts).
 Correlation: A measure of how two values you measure in your produc-
tion process are related.
 Regression analysis: A tool for predicting the value of one measurement
when you already know the value of another one.
 Variance: A measure of the variability of your production process. You
examine variance to determine whether a variation you discover is due
to chance or to a problem in your process.
For details on preparing to measure your quality process, head to Chapter 7.
Chapter 8 has the scoop on gathering data to evaluate. And you can check
out Statistics For Dummies, by Deborah Rumsey, PhD (Wiley), for a crash
course in basic statistics.

By the Numbers: Discovering the Basics
of Statistics in Quality
Statistics permeate throughout the business world, from entry-level workers
who crunch numbers to CEOs who forecast for the future. Although you don’t
need to be an expert in statistics to improve the quality of your processes,
you do need to have a basic understanding of statistics to undertake a qual-
ity improvement process (or to even know you need one). You need to under-
stand how statistics are useful as part of your quality control process and
how to interpret and apply them. In the following sections, we explain the
information you can gather from statistical evaluation and go over some
basic statistical terms.
The most commonly used tool for collecting and evaluating quality statistics
is Microsoft Excel. Most people have Excel (or a similar spreadsheet pro-
gram) installed on their work computers. We use Excel throughout this chap-
ter to do the heavy math lifting for the statistics work you’ll use in quality
control. We spend our time focused on how to interpret and apply the results
to the quality control process. It helps to have a basic understanding of how
to use Excel when working through this chapter and implementing a quality
control process; the latest edition of Excel For Dummies for your version of
Excel is a good place to start.
The story that statistics can 
tell you about quality
Statistics is the language you use to talk about the quality of your production
processes. It allows you to communicate the critical attributes of your
processes and gives you critical insights into how your processes are func-
tioning. By quantifying your quality control efforts, you can put a dollar figure
on the value of your proposed improvements and translate your efforts into
something that the leaders of your organization can understand. Statistics
also highlight the quality of the work you do so that your customers can see.
“There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.” This quote, often attributed to
Mark Twain, is a reminder that some people may use statistics to tell what-
ever story they want. People should be suspicious of statistics when it isn’t
clear how the data was collected and how the statistics were calculated. A
great example in history is the 1936 American presidential election. A famous
poll of the day predicted that Alf Landon would defeat Franklin Roosevelt in a
landslide. Of course, the opposite was true. How did the poll get it so wrong?
132
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Well, the people polled were selected based on phone numbers and car regis-
trations. Many Roosevelt voters were too poor during the Great Depression
to have either. Also, you should beware of allowing preconceived ideas to
creep into and skew your quality statistics.
The statistics terms that you need to know
A thorough understanding of the statistics in this chapter is beyond the
scope of this book, but you should be familiar with the following terms and
the equations behind them when implementing a quality control program:
 Mean: What most people call the average. To calculate a mean, you sum
all the appropriate values and divide by the total number of values. For
example, if your values are 1, 5, and 6, you add the values together (a
total of 12) and divide by 3 (the number of values) to get 4 as the mean.
 Range: The distance from the largest value to the smallest value. For
instance, if the mean of your customer satisfaction is 95 out of 100, but
your range is 80, it means at least one client rated you at a 20 or below.
What if it was your largest client that gave you a 15! You’re in trouble
regardless of the mean!
 Variance: A measure of the spread, or the dispersion of a variable
around the mean of all the concerned data. You calculate variance by
taking the sum of the squares of the deviations — that is, the sum of the
difference between the measurement value and the mean value of all the
values — and dividing by the number of samples minus one. Continuing
with the example from previous bullets, if your values are 1, 5, and 6,
and the mean is 4, you calculate the variance as follows:
• One has a difference of 3 from the mean of 4. The squared value of
the difference is 9.
• Five has a difference of 1 from the mean of 4. The squared value of
the difference is 1.
• Six has a difference of 2 from the mean of 4. The squared value of
the difference is 4.
• The sum of the squares (9, 1, and 4) is 14. Because the number of
samples is 3, you divide 14 by 2 (the number of samples minus 1),
for a variance of 7.
The problem with variance is that because it’s the sum of the squared
values, it isn’t in the same unit of measure as the original measurements.
If your original measurements are in inches, for example, the variance is
in inches squared, which isn’t very helpful. To fix that, you can use the
standard deviation.
133
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

 Standard deviation: The square root of the variance. Because the 
variance involves squares of the data, you get a value that appears in
the same units as the sample values when you use standard deviation.
The standard deviation is effectively a mean or an “average” of these
deviations. Using the previous example, the standard deviation is the
square root of 7, or 2.65. If your original measurements are in inches, 
the standard deviation is now in inches (rather than inches squared).
Standard deviation is a critical concept in Six Sigma — see Chapter 17.
Just One of Many: Delving into 
the Details of Sampling
In Chapter 4, we introduce the idea of using sampling as part of your inspec-
tion process. Sampling allows you to test a small number of the items you
produce to get information about the quality of the entire population of items
produced. In the following sections, we discuss why sampling works well
when handling statistics about your quality control process, and we go into
detail about how you include sampling in your quality process.
Understanding why sampling 
is a smart idea
We can list a number of good reasons why you should use sampling in 
quality control:
 Testing every item you produce at every stage of the production process
can get very expensive, very quickly. If you make 500 items each day, it’s
cheaper to test 10 items rather than all 500.
 The testing process can be destructive, so you can’t test every item you
produce. For example, you can’t test each bullet you make by firing it.
 For most processes and situations, using a sample can tell you just as
much as an exhaustive testing system. If 2 percent of the million items
you make have a problem, you have a good chance of finding one or two
bad ones by testing 100 or less. You can then figure out why those items
are bad to try to prevent the problem from occurring again.
134
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Most people are familiar with the use of polls, especially during presidential
election years; however, you may not be aware that they work on the same
principle as sampling for quality control. Although you hear about the occa-
sional poll being wrong, the very fact that a wrong poll is newsworthy sug-
gests that sampling for quality control or for predicting election outcomes is
prudent most of the time — as long as you sample correctly.
Examining the factors related 
to selecting a sample size
How large should your sample be when testing for your quality control
process? The bulk of the statistics behind calculating most sample sizes is
beyond the scope of this book; however, it’s very common to use 30 as a
sample size for many processes. This number is the generally accepted rule
of thumb for the minimum sample size.
You have a number of tools available to help you calculate sample size.
Several tools are available on the Internet; just type Sample Size Calculator
into your favorite search engine and wait for the results to pop up. However,
make sure you’re familiar with the following terms before you use any of the
tools you find:
 Population: The total number of items that you’re evaluating. You take a
sample of the population to perform your quality statistics.
 Confidence interval: The familiar margin-of-error figure you see in pub-
lished opinion polls and surveys. It represents the range that the value
would fall in if you surveyed all possible people. For example, if survey
results say that 62 percent of persons polled answered yes to a question,
plus or minus 3 percent, the 3 percent is the confidence interval for the
sample. Statistically, you can be certain that if the researchers had sur-
veyed everyone, the actual number who answered yes would’ve been
between 59 and 65 percent. Usually, the larger the sample size, the
smaller the confidence interval.
 Confidence level: Tells you how sure (confident) you can be in your
results. The level is the true percentage of the population who would’ve
picked the answer that falls within the confidence interval. A 95-percent
confidence level means that you can be 95 percent certain that the real
answer is within the confidence interval. Most quality people use a 95-
percent confidence level.
135
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

Three factors determine the size of the confidence interval for a given 
confidence level:
 Sample size: The larger the sample, the closer it reflects the true value
of the population, meaning the confidence interval is smaller. (Note:
This relationship isn’t linear; doubling the sample size doesn’t shrink 
the confidence interval by half.)
 Range between values: The larger the range between the values, the
less the chance for error. For example, if the possible values have a
range of 50, it’s more likely that your sample will accurately reflect the
population than if the range is only 5.
 Population size: The larger the population, the more accurate the
sample. The mathematics of probability prove that population is impor-
tant only when the total population is relatively small. It’s more likely to
have a sample that doesn’t reflect the total population for a population
of 100 than it is for a population of 100,000.
Recognizing the importance 
of random sampling
For the sake of your quality control process, you must choose your samples
randomly. The statistics we discuss in this chapter count on random sam-
ples. Whenever you use sampling, you run a risk that the sample won’t be
sufficiently representative of the population from which it was drawn; this 
is known as sampling error. Confidence intervals are especially sensitive to
errors when the sampling isn’t random.
Random sampling also avoids influence by people involved in the process;
for example, the supervisor of a department that makes widgets may be
tempted to provide samples from his best worker if he’s asked to provide
sample widgets to test. To avoid this situation, you must ensure that the 
samples provided are randomly selected. Although you can use a coin or
playing cards to randomly select samples to test, most people use a random-
number table or software to generate random numbers.
Some flaw in the data-collection process usually causes nonrandom samples
(see Chapter 8 for more on data collection). An example of a poor sample
would be taking a sample from only one shift and using the data to make
judgments about products made on other shifts.
136
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

More Bang for Your Buck: 
Using Pareto Analysis
A Pareto chart is a specialized histogram — a commonly used graph for 
showing frequency distributions, which illustrate how often each unique
value in a set of data occurs — that you use to identify issues that cause a
disproportionate amount of your quality problems (see Chapter 8 for more
discussion of the chart). The chart provides a process to help you group and
organize your data in a manner that helps you focus your time and resources
on the problems that matter most. You’ll find the chart simple in its design
and construction, but able to provide powerful insights into your processes.
A properly constructed Pareto chart can help your quality control effort in
many ways, including the following:
 Tracking down the source of problems
 Assisting in setting priorities
 Determining the root cause of a problem
 Focusing your efforts where they’ll have the biggest impact
A Pareto chart is effective only when the data you gather follows the Pareto
Principle — when approximately 20 percent of the issues cause 80 percent of
the problems (see Chapter 8 for details).
In the following sections, we explain how to draw and evaluate a Pareto chart
for your quality process. As an example, we use a pizza parlor that’s having a
problem with customers returning too many pizzas. The manager of the
parlor is concerned about the number of returns, both from a cost perspec-
tive and how they affect customer satisfaction. A Pareto chart can help him
focus on the most critical issues that cause customers to be unhappy with
their pizzas.
Creating a Pareto chart
Creating a Pareto chart isn’t difficult, but you must do it correctly to get
results that you can use for your quality improvement process. In the 
following sections, we explain how to create a Pareto chart successfully.
137
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

Selecting categories and gathering information
Before you create the actual Pareto chart, you need to perform the following
preparatory steps:
1. Determine the problem or process you need to evaluate. Use tech-
niques such as brainstorming, reviewing anecdotal data, or conducting
interviews with stakeholders to select the problem or process that you
should tackle first (we cover interviews with customers in Chapter 6). A
pizza parlor may decide to look for sources of pizza quality issues, such
as under- or overcooked pizza, incorrect toppings, or pizza served cold.
2. Select the time frame to collect the data and the data-collection
process you should use. The data should be as accurate and timely as
possible. (Chapter 8 has all the information you need to collect your
data.) If most of the pizza quality problems occur during lunch, the 
manager can start his data-collection process during the lunch rush.
3. Define the categories to use. By placing the data you collect about a
quality issue into categories, you can quickly determine a solution to
prevent a problem.
Your organization or industry may already have defined quality cate-
gories that you can use (see Chapter 2 for details on quality standards).
If not, you need to define the overall type of category (such as location,
subject, or cause) and then create standard phrases to describe each
category. Be as consistent as possible in the scope and naming of each
category. You must also define how you assign a problem to a category
and whether you can place a problem in more than one category.
Some examples of quality problems for which you can easily create 
categories include
• Customer returns
• Errors on college applications
• Workplace injuries
• Part defects
• Software bugs
In the pizza-parlor problem, some quality-issue categories include
• Undercooked pizza
• Overcooked pizza
• Too few toppings on the pizza
• Wrong toppings on the pizza
138
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

• Cold pizza
• Pizza delivered late
4. Define what you want to measure. Are you going to count the fre-
quency of a problem or its impact? For example, the manager of the
pizza parlor could measure the impact of returned pizzas in dollars lost
(due to production and labor costs) or in time lost (for labor).
5. Create a data-collection sheet to collect your data. List each of the
quality factors (such as under- and overcooked pizza, wrong toppings,
and so on) on the check sheet.
6. Collect the data. For the pizza parlor, a count of each error will provide
the necessary data.
Be sure to train your data collectors so that they collect the data in a
correct and consistent manner. You should have at least 50 total points
of data or observations, though more is usually better (see Chapter 8 for
specifics).
Forming the chart
After you finish your preparatory work and collect the necessary data 
(see the previous section), you can form the Pareto chart by using the 
following steps:
1. Total each category for the time period you select. See Figure 9-1 for a
sample chart for the pizza-parlor example.
2. Determine the percentage for each category. This isn’t necessary, but
it’s helpful for determining when you reach the 80 percent mark of the
Pareto Principle (see Chapter 8).
3. Put the categories on the chart as bars, placed side by side as in a 
histogram (see Chapter 8 for more about histograms). You place the
categories on the X-axis (the horizontal); you note the frequency (or
counted value) on the Y-axis (the vertical).
The height of each bar represents the value for that category (such as
count, cost, time, and so on). The largest bar should go on the left, and
you should place the remaining bars in descending order of height so
that the smallest bar falls on the right.
You make a placement exception if you use the category “Other”; you
place it to the extreme right, regardless of its height. See Figure 9-1 to
check out the bars for the pizza return problem.
4. Analyze the data, using the chart as your guide (see the following 
section for details).
139
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

In addition to creating the category bars on a Pareto chart, you may want to
add a line that shows the cumulative percentage of errors as you add each
category. You calculate the cumulative percentage by starting with the lowest
percentage and adding it to the next lowest percentage. Repeat until you
reach the last attribute, which should have a cumulative percentage of 100
percent. This action helps to identify the categories contributing to 80 per-
cent of your problem within the Pareto Principle. In Figure 9-1, you can see
that 71 percent of the issues stem from only two categories.
Interpreting a Pareto chart
A Pareto chart helps by graphically showing the issues that contribute the
most to your problematic product or process. After you create a Pareto
chart, you can work with what the chart is trying to tell you by focusing your
quality efforts on the bars to the left (the tallest ones) in order to maximize
the results from your efforts. In most cases, it takes the same amount of
effort to reduce a tall bar by 50 percent as it does a smaller bar. Occasionally,
you can easily eliminate a small bar, but more often you get the biggest bene-
fit by working on the larger bars. A Pareto chart helps you to separate the
critical few from the insignificant many. We show you what to look for in your
Pareto chart in the following sections.
Recognizing possible patterns in your Pareto chart
You can achieve three different outcomes when creating a Pareto chart:

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

 A good Pareto chart. The chart clearly shows that your process follows
the Pareto Principle, where the majority of your problems fall in the top
two or three categories. Figure 9-1 gives you an example of a good
Pareto chart. If your chart looks like this, focus on the categories that
make up close to 80 percent of your problems. You may want to create
another Pareto chart based on the possible causes of the top categories
to determine root cause(s) of the problems.
 No clear winners. The chart in Figure 9-2 shows a slow decline from left
to right — not really a Pareto effect. The chart doesn’t follow the 80/20
rule; it may take six or eight categories to reach 80 percent. You can still
focus on the highest categories first, but you won’t get as dramatic an
improvement as you will with a good Pareto situation.
 An evenly distributed chart, which doesn’t show the Pareto Principle.
The chart in Figure 9-3 is an example. You can see that 76 percent of the
issues fall across the first five categories, and that the bars representing
the categories are roughly the same height. Focusing on any one of the
categories has no added value. You may need to create new categories
from a different perspective and try again. Sorry!
Putting Pareto results to good use
After you define a category on a Pareto chart as a problem primed for fixing
(see the previous sections), ask yourself who, what, where, when, how, and
why to try to determine possible solutions. Looking at the Pareto chart for
the pizza problem in Figure 9-1, you can see that 71 percent of the problem
pizzas have cooking-time issues. The quality manager of the pizza parlor
should now look at how cooking time is determined to see if the pizza makers
can consistently cook the pizzas for the correct amount of time.

Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

You should apply obvious solutions, even for small categories. Anyone famil-
iar with the process should be able to come up with some obvious solutions
to try after a problem has been identified.
Potential problems that may pop up
Problems you may encounter with your Pareto chart include the following:
 The “Other” bar is too large. This bar should never be the tallest bar; if
it is, you need to break down the category into new categories because
you can’t work on issues you haven’t identified. The category doesn’t
have to be the smallest, however, because it’s useful for grouping
insignificant problems.
 Bad data. If the data is old, or based on invalid opinions or assumptions,
you may reach the wrong conclusion.
 Too little data. A rule of thumb is to have at least 50 observations. The
key is to continue to get data until you reach a point where the shape of
the graph doesn’t change with the addition of more data (see Chapter 8
for info on data collection).
 Bad categories (or counting the wrong thing). You may want to look at
cost or time rather than frequency, for example. Just because a problem
occurs most frequently doesn’t necessarily make it the most expensive
problem. It pays to look at a problem from several angles.
The most frequent problem isn’t always the most important! Be aware of the
impact of all the problems you identify on your customers or organization.
When looking at or adjusting categories, think about other factors that may
influence the data. For example, in the pizza problem, the graph may be
evenly distributed at first. If the parlor manager changes the way observers
look at the data by creating a graph for just Monday through Friday and

another for the weekends, rather than one overall graph, he or she may 
discover different problems for each graph that exhibit the Pareto Principle.
Such a discovery would merit the need for separate solutions for the week-
day shifts versus the weekend shifts.
The Positive and the Negative: 
Coming Up with Correlations
In many production processes, the value of one measurement is related or
connected to the value of another measurement. For example, what effect
might temperature or humidity have on your production process? Can the
education level of a call-center employee predict his or her average call time?
Do years of experience really make a difference in production output level?
You can use statistics to answer these and other questions that involve the
search for a relationship between two values (or variables) in a process.
The degree of the relationship between two or more values in statistics is
called correlation. If a relationship exists, you can implement changes to one
value that have a desirable effect on the other value and that make a big differ-
ence in the quality of your product. In the following sections, we explain the
details of correlations and how to determine a correlation between two values.
What exactly is a correlation?
A correlation exists between two values if a change in one value causes a
change in another value. If the value of one measurement increases and, 
at the same time, the value of another measurement increases, a positive 
correlation exists between the two values — in other words, the values move
in the same direction. A negative correlation exists when the values move in
different directions: If one value increases, the other decreases.
If you suspect that a relationship exists between two values in your production
process, you can measure the correlation to see how much of a relationship
really exists. Technically, what you’re testing for is the “statistical significance”
of the relationship. You find the significance by calculating what’s known as the
correlation coefficient (we show you how to calculate the coefficient later in
this chapter). The correlation coefficient is simply a number between –1 and 
1 that measures how closely two values are related. A positive correlation 
coefficient (between 0 and 1) means that the values move in the same direction
(a positive correlation); a negative correlation coefficient (between 0 and –1)
means that the values move in the opposite direction (a negative correlation).
143
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

You also must look at the degree of the relationship; the closer the values are
related, the closer the correlation coefficient gets to 1 (or –1).
 If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or –1, the values are strongly
related.
 If the correlation coefficient is exactly 1 or –1, the values are perfectly
related.
 A correlation coefficient close to 0 means the values are weakly related.
 A correlation coefficient of 0 means that no relationship exists between
the two values.
Use Table 9-1 when evaluating a correlation coefficient.
Table 9-1
Strength of a Correlation

Interpretation
0.0 to 0.3
Little or no correlation
0.3 to 0.5
Low correlation
0.5 to 0.7
Moderate correlation
0.7 to 0.9
High correlation
0.9 to 1.0
Very high correlation
Technically, you’re just looking at the linear relationship between two 
variables when examining correlation. A linear relationship is one where 
the variables move together in a straight line on a graph. The relationship
could take other shapes, such as a logarithmic (shaped like a hockey stick), 
a sigmoid (curved like the letter “S”), or any number of other forms.
How do you determine 
and use a correlation?
So how do you calculate correlation, and what do you do with it to improve
quality? In the following sections, we explain how to use a scatter diagram to
see a correlation, how to calculate the correlation coefficient to determine
the strength of the relationship, and how to use the results of the diagram.
144
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Plotting data on a scatter diagram
The first step in determining a correlation, after collecting your data, is to
graph the values you want to analyze on a standard coordinate plane and
examine the result to see if a relationship seems to exist. You create what’s
called a scatter diagram (we introduce scatter diagrams in Chapter 8). A scatter
diagram gives you a general clue as to the relationship between two values.
Draw a graph with one variable on the X-axis and the other on the Y-axis.
Figure 9-4 shows a sample scatter diagram, where you compare the tempera-
ture of a surrounding area to the diameter of a part being made. Looking at
the chart, you can see that as the temperature rises, the diameter of the part
gets larger. You can see a positive correlation when the points on the graph
go from the lower left to the upper right. If the opposite situation occurred —
the diameter of the part got smaller as the temperature rose — the points on
the graph would start on the upper-left portion of the graph and go to the
lower right (what a negative correlation looks like).
In Microsoft Excel, you can right-click on one of the points of the scatter 
diagram and have the program draw a trend line (see Figure 9-5). The line
makes the correlation between the variables even clearer. You also can draw
the trend line by hand.

Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

Although you may see a general correlation between two values when you
plot them on a plane, you still have to watch out for exceptions to the overall
trend. Correlation is about an entire set of data, and some values may not fit
the overall trend of the data. For example, in Figure 9-5 you see a couple of
points in the middle that don’t fit as neatly on the trend line as most of the
other values. Also, be very careful about using the trend line to make predic-
tions outside the range of the data on the graph. Most trends don’t hold for-
ever in either direction. For example, increasing the oven temperature will
decrease the cooking time of a pizza, but you can’t decrease the cooking time
to less than zero.
Calculating the correlation coefficient
Although a scatter diagram and a trend line give you a general clue about the
relationship between two values (see the previous section), they may not
illustrate the strength of the relationship. Your next step is to calculate the
correlation coefficient to get a more accurate picture of the relationship. You
could calculate the value by hand, but being the tool-using animal you are,
you can use Microsoft Excel to calculate the value for you. Find out how in
the following steps:
1. Place the data for the first value (whatever you placed on the X-axis in
the scatter diagram) in column A and the corresponding data for the
second value (whatever you placed on the Y-axis) in column B.
2. Go to the main menu at the top and select Tools and then Add-Ins.
Review the list of add-ins that appears to make sure the Analysis
ToolPak is checked. If not, check it.

correlated.

Moving forward with your results
After you know whether two values are correlated, and you’ve identified the
strength of that relationship, you can use this information to make adjust-
ments in the process to improve your quality. You should be most interested
in relationships where the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or –1. From 
the example in the previous sections, you can see that as the temperature
increases, the diameter of the hole increases. So, if the hole is becoming too
big, you know you can reduce the size of the hole by reducing the tempera-
ture of the piece when you drill the hole. Conversely, you can raise the tem-
perature if you need a bigger hole.
Let Me Guess: Predicting Values 
with Regression Analysis
You can use a process known as regression analysis to develop an equation
that allows you to predict the value of one measurement when you know the
value of another. Becoming clairvoyant is useful in quality control because
you can determine what and how much to change if you have a quality issue.
In our example in the previous section on correlation, it may be helpful to be
able to predict the diameter of the part if you know the temperature. This can
help you determine what temperature to keep the work area at to ensure that
the part is the diameter you want.
We don’t go into all the statistics that make regression analysis work, but in
the following sections, we show you how to use Microsoft Excel to perform
regression analysis and how to use the results of your analysis in your quality
control process.
Getting the gist of regression analysis
Regression analysis takes you beyond showing that the measurements of 
the values you’ve taken in the past are related by allowing you to predict what
the value of one measurement will be if you know the value of another mea-
surement. The simplest type of regression analysis is called linear regression.
Linear regression exists when you can draw a straight line through a scatter
diagram of two variables. For example, you can perform linear regression in the
previous section by drawing a trend line on the scatter diagram in Figure 9-5.
Statisticians may point out that you have to make a number of assumptions
when you use linear regression, but for our purposes it will work just fine.

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Performing a regression analysis
To perform a regression analysis, you must first define the value that you
want to measure — the independent variable — and the value that you want
to predict with the measurement — the dependent variable. The labels make
sense if you think about it: The value that you want to predict is dependent
upon the value you get when you measure the first variable.
When you draw your graph, you usually plot the independent variable on the
X-axis and the dependent variable on the Y-axis. Referring to Figure 9-5, you
see the temperature on the X-axis and the diameter of the part on the Y-axis.
So, temperature is the independent value that you can use to predict the part
diameter (the dependent variable).
After you define your measurable values, you collect data on your values. At
that point, you can use Microsoft Excel to perform a regression analysis to
get an equation you can use to predict the part diameter when you know the
temperature. Follow these steps to perform the analysis:
1. Go to the main menu in Excel and select Tools and then Data Analysis.
If you don’t see this option, be sure that the Analysis ToolPak is installed
by going to Add-Ins in the Tools menu and checking Analysis ToolPak.
2. In the list of options that appears, click Regression and then click OK;
you see the dialog box that appears in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8:

149
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

3. For the Input Y Range, select the data for your dependent variable; for
the independent variable, use the Input X Range.
Check the boxes marked Labels and Normal Probability Plots.
4. Click OK; Excel will open a new worksheet with the results of the
regression analysis (see Figure 9-9).
Don’t get overwhelmed by the amount of information on the worksheet
because you won’t be using most of it. What’s important for your purposes
are the values you need to create a regression equation. You can find these
values listed at the bottom left of the worksheet under the heading
Coefficients.
The regression equation for determining value y when you know the value of
x is as follows:
y = bx + a
In this equation, b is the slope of the line (how quickly the line goes up or
down) and a is the intercept (the point where the line crosses the Y-axis). You
can get these values from the worksheet you just created in the previous list:
The first value under the Coefficients heading is a and the second value is b.
Looking at the example in Figure 9-9, your regression equation is (rounding to
three decimal places)
y = 0.071x + 0.057
You can now use this equation to predict the value of one of the variables
when you know the value of the other.
Figure 9-9:

150
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Using the results of a regression analysis
After you have an equation that describes the relationship between the two
values, you can predict the value for one variable when you know the value
of the other. To use the previous section’s equation to predict the diameter 
of the part in question when you know the temperature (the example that
appears in previous figures and sections), you simply solve the regression
equation by substituting the temperature for x. For example, if the tempera-
ture is 74°F, the equation becomes
y = 0.071(74) + 0.057
y = 5.311
The prediction for the diameter of the part when the temperature is 74°F is
5.311. If you look at the graph with the trend line in Figure 9-5, you see that
this figure looks about right.
If you want the diameter of your hole to be exactly 5.000, you can use the 
following equation to determine what the temperature should be:
5.000 = 0.071x + 0.057
4.943 = 0.071x
69.6 = x
So, to make the diameter of the hole as close to 5.000 as possible, you should
try to keep the temperature as close to 69.6°F as possible.
Consistency Counts: Analyzing Variance
You don’t want variation in the process that produces the product or delivers
the service for your customers. A consistent product or service is the Holy
Grail, because a consistent product or service is more likely to meet your
customers’ needs. You can’t eliminate variation, but you can make an effort
to control it. In the following sections, we discuss how you can determine
whether variation is something you need to worry about and how you can
measure variation between two or more processes.
Identifying a variance issue
The statistical process you use to measure the variation between two or more
processes is called variance. To analyze the variation in your processes to find
out if you should be concerned about it, you use a process called analysis of
151
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

variance, or ANOVA. Using this process, you can determine if a difference
exists in the output of the processes — a difference that goes beyond what
you’d expect due to random chance. If you discover a variation between the
processes that isn’t random, you know to look for the cause of the variation.
Businesses use ANOVA throughout many industries to help identify the
sources of potential problems in the production process. They want to find
out whether variation is due to differences within the process itself or due to
differences between two or more processes. With this information, you can
vary the factors in your production process to determine the cause of the
variation.
The information produced by the ANOVA test is called the F ratio, named
after its inventor, Sir Ronald A. Fisher. You can use the ANOVA test to evalu-
ate the differences between any number of data sets, not just two. You can
measure the data from any process; the number of measurements in each
sample doesn’t have to be the same. The number of samples measured can
be as little as three and as large as infinity.
Calculating and using variance
You can use Microsoft Excel to calculate the values for your ANOVA test to
analyze variance. This allows you to spend more of your time interpreting
and using the results. As an example here, we look at a production process
that consists of two different machines (Machine A and Machine B) used to
make a part. We’ve collected data on the diameter of 20 different parts made
by each machine. In Figure 9-10, you can see the values entered into an Excel
spreadsheet. We use columns for the different machines and enter the values
for each time we measure in the same row.
Figure 9-10:
You can

152
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Follow these steps to use Excel to calculate the values for your ANOVA test:
1. Go to the main menu in Excel and select Tools and then Data Analysis.
In the list of options that appears, click ANOVA: Single Factor and then
click OK.
If you don’t see the data-analysis option, be sure that the Analysis
ToolPak is installed by going to Add-Ins in the Tools menu and checking
Analysis ToolPak.
2. For the input range, select both columns of data. Check Labels in First
Row if you’ve selected the row with the names of the machines. Select
the Output option to create the table where you want and click OK.
Excel will now create your ANOVA table, as shown in Figure 9-11.
A few items on the table should be easy to interpret; the Summary section
contains the following information, for example:
 The count of measurement values
 The sum and mean of the measurements
 The variance for each machine
You can see from the table in Figure 9-11 that the mean diameter for the parts
made with Machine B is slightly larger than the mean of those made with
Machine A, and the variance between the parts also is slightly larger for
Machine B. The next question you want to answer is whether the variation
between Machine A and Machine B is something you need to worry about.

table is

153
Chapter 9: Evaluating Quality with Statistics

To answer this question, you need to interpret the ANOVA output by 
evaluating the F ratio (the information produced by the ANOVA test):
 If the F ratio (marked in the F column in Figure 9-11 in the ANOVA table)
is larger than the F critical value (F crit), a statistically significant differ-
ence exists between the processes. Therefore, you need to examine the
processes to see what’s causing the difference.
 If the F ratio is smaller than the F critical value, the differences between
the machines are best explained by chance.
Looking at the example in Figure 9-11, you can see that the F ratio is smaller
than the F critical value, so you can assume that any difference between the
two machines occurs strictly by chance.

he following quote is from the “father” of Statistical Process Control
(SPC), Walter Shewhart. Shewhart pioneered the idea that all manufactur-
ing processes produce some variation that’s natural to the processes and
that quality problems arise when abnormal variation occurs. Shewhart was
the first to use statistics to measure the natural variation of a process and
detect the occurrence of unnatural variation.
Bringing a production process into a state of ‘statistical control,’ where there
is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to
predict future output and to manage a process economically.
— Walter Shewhart
In this chapter, you find out how to use simple statistical techniques to, as
Shewhart said, bring your production processes into a state of “statistical
control” by eliminating variation. With this control and variance elimination,
you can produce a quality product or service for your customers.
Grasping the Basics of Statistical
Process Control
Statistical Process Control (SPC) is defined as the use of statistical tools and
techniques to measure a production process in order to detect change. To
produce a quality product, you must have a process that’s consistent. SPC

helps you detect any changes in the process, because change is more times
than not a bad thing. SPC is a philosophy that embraces the idea of continu-
ous improvement brought on by using an assortment of statistical tools. The
basis of the philosophy is that problems within a system cause most of your
process issues, not problems with individual people. When done correctly,
SPC puts data about a process in the hands of those that are best able to
improve the process.
Even though the term “Statistical Process Control” sounds complicated, the
general idea behind SPC is really pretty simple: You collect samples from a
production process and use charts to plot the variability of the samples
against target specifications. With SPC, you can catch and fix problems before
you have a chance to make bad products or provide bad services.
SPC consists of the following four basic steps:
1. Measuring a production process (which we cover in Chapter 8; see
Chapter 7 for information on preparing to measure a process)
2. Making the process consistent by eliminating variability (see the later
section “Using Control Charts Effectively”)
3. Monitoring the process
4. Improving the process to get as close to the target value — what the 
customer wants — as possible (see the later section “Calculating
Process Capability”)
SPC builds on the statistics we discuss in Chapter 9 and applies those statis-
tics to the activity of monitoring a production process. By monitoring your
process, you can detect whether a change has occurred and track down the
reason for the change before you start making bad products or delivering
bad services.
In the following sections, we explain the basic concepts and tools of SPC and
go over its advantages and disadvantages.
Don’t limit your use of SPC to simple manufacturing processes. Businesses
can use SPC both on the factory floor and in an office environment. It not
only improves a manufacturing process, but also reduces problems with any
business function. Within an office setting, SPC can reduce errors and
improve the efficiency of administrative tasks such as data entry, invoice gen-
eration, order processing, and the creation of purchase orders.
The importance of the normal curve
Traditional quality control involves inspecting products after their creation
and making judgments as to whether the items are suitable for customer use
(see Chapter 4 for more about inspection). Statistical Process Control, on the
156
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

other hand, uses statistical tools to monitor the performance of a production
process over time to detect problems before the process can create products
that don’t meet customer specifications. The main assumption is that any
process that produces a product will have some variation built in. No combi-
nation of machine and human can produce a product that’s exactly the same
each time.
For example, say you’re drilling a hole that’s designed to be 13.5 millimeters
in diameter. Using a new drill bit and a calibrated drill, you start out making
holes exactly 13.5 mm in diameter. But are the holes really 13.5 mm? If you
measure to a greater precision than one decimal place, you may find that the
diameter falls within a range, with 13.5 in the middle. For instance, a hole that
you measure to three decimal places may be between 13.490 mm and 13.510 mm.
As long as the holes stay within this range, though they’re acceptable to the
customer (see Chapter 6 for more about customer specifications).
However, over time, the drill bit may wear down (causing you to drill smaller
holes), or the drill itself may start to go out of alignment (causing the holes 
to get bigger). Using traditional quality control inspection, you’d continue to
drill holes until the diameter changed enough to where it no longer measured
13.5 mm, at which point you’d scrap any parts made with bad holes.
If you plot the frequency of the measurements in a histogram (we cover 
histograms in detail in Chapter 8), you end up with a chart similar to the 
one in Figure 10-1. You can see that most values are close to the average;
fewer values occur the further you get from the average. We call this occur-
rence a normal process.

Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

If you connect the values in the histogram with a line, you create a curve,
shown in Figure 10-2. The curve is called the normal distribution curve, or the
normal curve. The normal curve is an important tool because it graphically
shows the variation in a measured process. The wider the curve, the more a
process varies, so, naturally, you want to make your curve as skinny as possi-
ble. You also want the average, or middle, part of your curve to be as close as
possible to your customers’ desired value for whatever it is you’re measur-
ing. Keep these goals in mind as you discover more detail about the SPC
process in this chapter.
Useful tools for calculating 
and plotting within SPC
Statistical Process Control isn’t a single process-measuring tool; it’s a collection
of tools and techniques you use to improve your organization’s quality output.
The great thing about most SPC tools is that they’re simple to implement (you
need only basic graphing and math skills), and, when used in combination,
they can tell you most everything you need to know about your production
process. Although many of the concepts are based on some pretty deep statis-
tics, you don’t need to understand all the mathematical groundwork to use
them to improve the quality of your processes. Knowing the statistics can help
you understand your processes better (like anything else, the more you know,
the better!), but you don’t have to be an expert in statistics to use the output of
the tools.
The following list presents the tools commonly used in SPC:

Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

 Flowcharts: Excellent tools for visualizing a process. A good flowchart
shows how a process works by documenting the flow of material or
information through the process in sequential order. (You can find more
info on flowcharts in Chapters 12 and 16.) The best time to use a flow-
chart is at the beginning of a quality improvement project to ensure that
everyone agrees on how the process functions. Technically, flowcharts
aren’t statistical tools, but they give your organization a great way to
start a quality project off on the right foot.
 Histograms: Great tools for graphically viewing quality data. Histograms
are the primary tools used in SPC (see Chapter 8 for more). A histogram
can tell you information about the average of quality data, the amount of
variation in a data set, and what the pattern of the variation is. It also
can illustrate how well the data stays within customer specifications
(refer to Figure 10-1).
 Scatter diagrams: Designed to find a pattern in data or a relationship
between two variables (see Chapter 8 for more information).
 Pareto charts: Great tools for getting the most bang for your buck in
quality improvement efforts. Pareto charts show the most frequently
occurring factors that cause quality problems, and they give you direc-
tion for tackling the most important problems first. (See Chapter 9 for
more on Pareto charts.)
 Run charts: Graphs that show the values of processes over time or in
sequence. A run chart can show a single factor in order to spot a trend,
or it can show two factors to find out if a relationship exists. Run charts
aren’t based on statistics, but they’re still useful for the aforementioned
purposes. A run chart is your main tool for controlling your process on a
day-to-day basis.
See Figure 10-3 for a sample run chart that shows the relationship between
two values (in this case, temperature in a work area and the diameter of a
hole in a part). Notice how two different Y-axes make it easier to see the
relationship. The X-axis shows the sequence of the measurements taken.
In this example, the lines for temperature and diameter seem to run
together, so a relationship between the two attributes probably exists.
 Control charts: Simple, yet powerful tools for identifying whether an
operation or process is in or out of control. Based on the idea of a run
chart, a control chart adds the concept of control limits and a mean line
that indicates when a process is getting out of control. Control charts
are such an important part of SPC that we go into much more detail
about them in the later section “Using Control Charts Effectively.”
The pros and cons of SPC
Like any other quality control concept, Statistical Process Control has its
pluses and its minuses. We cover both in the following sections.
159
Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

The pros
Pluses of SPC include the following:
 Focuses on detecting and monitoring process improvement over time
 Guides you in taking the appropriate action to improve your production
processes
 Helps you understand your organization’s capability of achieving targets
(usually based on customer specifications)
We assume that you won’t use SPC because of your love for statistics (well,
maybe you will; some of us do!). We assume that you’ll use SPC for the same
reason people do anything in business: to make more money. SPC helps your
organization make more money by
 Improving the quality of your product or service
 Reducing waste
 Improving productivity
 Making your processes more efficient

 SPC requires some understanding of statistics.
 SPC doesn’t guarantee that you’ll send no bad products to the customer.
 SPC is just a tool, and like any other tool, it derives much of its value
from the skill of the people using it (see Chapter 5 for ideas on training
employees).
Using Control Charts Effectively
What you really want to know through Statistical Process Control is whether
your organization’s production process is making items correctly based on
customer specifications. Control charts are your best tools for tracking your
process to detect variation that isn’t caused by normal variation in the
process, but rather by some fundamental change in the process that needs
your attention. The bare-bones procedure for creating and interpreting a con-
trol chart is as follows:
1. Sample the process at some regular interval.
2. Plot whatever statistic you’re using on a control chart.
3. Look at the chart to see if the process is in control.
4. If the process isn’t in control, look for the cause and correct it.
In the following sections, we show you the ideas behind control charts, and
we let you know how to use control charts in order to verify that your
process actually does what it should be doing.
Detecting different types of variation
All control charts have the same basic purpose: to detect variation in a pro-
duction process — unnatural variation that isn’t a part of the normal process.
You deal with two different types of variation in a process:
 Common-cause variation: The variation inherent in the process. As long
as the process doesn’t change, the common-cause variation stays the
same. Common-cause variation is part of the production process for 
one or more reasons: because of the nature of the system, the way the
process is operated, or the way the process is managed. You can change
common-cause variation only by making a change to the process itself.
For example, the precision of a machine used in drilling a hole deter-
mines how much variation is normal for that machine. If the machine is
capable of centering the hole within 0.25 millimeters of the desired loca-
tion, any variation within 0.25 millimeters of the desired location is the
common-cause variation for that machine.
161
Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

 Special-cause variation: Occurs when a change takes place in the
process. It could be an undesirable change, such as a tool wearing out,
or it could a desirable change, such as the implementation of a new
machine that has less variation than the previous machine. Special-
cause variation is usually due to some kind of exception to the process,
and it’s often specific to a particular machine, production shift, operator,
or batch of raw material.
The main purpose of going through the SPC process is the identification
and removal of undesirable special-cause variation. If you can explain
the variation and identify it as a good thing (such as a more precise
machine), you’re okay; if not, you must track down the source of the
change and remove it.
One of the keys to properly using SPC is correctly identifying a variation as
common-cause or special-cause. It can be difficult to tell the difference, so 
we give you some tips in the later section “Reading a control chart.”
Understanding a control chart’s elements
Before we can talk about how to build a control chart, you need to know
some terms in order to understand how it works; we cover the lingo you 
need to know in the following sections.
Population, sample, mean, and range
Four basic, yet important, statistical concepts are population, sample, mean,
and range. Everything else you do builds on an understanding of these topics:
 Population: The entire group of members of whatever it is you’re 
measuring or counting. If you’re talking about a production process, 
the population is all the items that you produce by using that process.
 Sample: A subset of the population. In most cases, you can’t test all 
the items you produce, so you have to test a representative sample.
(Chapters 4 and 9 have the full scoop on the sampling process.)
 Mean: The arithmetic average of all the values that you measure for 
a given test. You calculate the mean by adding up all the individual 
measurements and then dividing by the total number of measurements.
 Range: From the largest to the smallest. For instance, customer 
satisfaction scores between 20 and 100 have a range of 80.
Standard deviation
Standard deviation is a measure of the range of a variation around the average
of a group of measurements. In other words, it’s the average distance that each
measurement is from the mean of all the measurements. In Statistical Process
162
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Control, the Greek letter sigma (σ) refers to the standard deviation of an entire
population. (You can find out more about the use of sigma in Chapter 17.)
You calculate standard deviation by following these steps (we include a
simple example throughout the steps to keep the math easy):
1. Take the difference between each recorded measurement and the
mean to get the deviation for each measurement.
Say you have the following five measurements: 6, 8, 7, 9, and 10. Add the
measurements for a total of 40. Then divide 40 by 5 for a mean of 8.
Now take the difference of each of these measurements from the mean:
6 – 8 = –2
8 – 8 = 0
7 – 8 = –1
9 – 8 = 1
10 – 8 = 2
So, your differences are –2, 0, –1, 1, and 2.
2. Square each of these differences that you calculated in Step 1.
The squared values are the following:
–22 = 4
02 = 0
–12 = 1
12 = 1
22 = 4
3. Add each of the squared values from Step 2 together.
You have 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10.
4. Divide the added value from Step 3 by the number of samples minus 1
(known as the sample fudge factor).
Subtract 1 from 5 for a total of 4, and then divide 10 by 4 for a total of 2.5.
5. Take the square root of the value from Step 4.
The square root of 2.5 is 1.58, which is your standard deviation.
In the big picture, what the standard deviation tells you is that for most
processes, 69 percent of all measurements fall within one deviation on either
side of the mean; in the example, you should expect 69 percent of your mea-
surements to be between (8 – 1.58) and (8 + 1.58), or between 6.42 and 9.58.
In addition, expect 99.4 percent of all measurements to fall within two stan-
dard deviations and 99.9966 percent to fall within three standard deviations.
163
Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

Control limits
The control limits (both an upper limit and a lower limit) are the ranges you
use on your SPC control charts. All production processes fluctuate over time,
but if the processes are stable, they’ll stay with certain limits. Businesses
normally set the control limits at three standard deviations (sigma), plus and
minus, from the mean or target value (see the previous section for more on
calculating sigma). Ideally, your mean is your target value. In the previous
section’s example, the values normally vary on either side of the mean.
You use control limits to guide your SPC process for two main reasons:
 You don’t want to spend time on each little change in a process that’s
due to random chance.
 You don’t want an excessive number of false alarms.
Checking out different 
kinds of control charts
You can use several different types of control charts for Statistical Process
Control, with each one using a different statistic. You create different types 
of charts depending on the type of data you’re collecting. The two types of
data you focus on for control charts (we cover in detail the types of data in
Chapter 4) are
 Attribute (or discrete) data: Data that references whether a certain 
condition exists, such as a color or a yes/no situation.
 Variable (or continuous) data: Data that you measure on a continuous
scale, such as length, diameter, or temperature.
For variable data, here are the most commonly used control charts:
 X-bar chart: Tracks the mean of a set of samples over some period of
time. X-bar (usually written as the letter “X” with a line over the top) is 
a statistical notation for the mean. This chart is probably the most com-
monly used control chart out there, as you normally want your process
mean to equal the customer’s specification.
 R (Range) chart: Used to track the range of a set of samples over 
time. In most cases, a low range is good; it indicates that your process 
is consistent.
In practice, you look at the X-bar and R charts together. Although range is
important, by itself it doesn’t tell the whole story. Range tells you how much
variation you have in your process, but is no range always good? No! What if
your customers want a 3-inch hole in a product and you send them products
164
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

with 8-inch holes? The X-bar chart shows that you’re outside the customer
specification, but the R chart says everything is wonderful.
For attribute data, here are the most commonly used control charts:
 p chart: The “p” stands for the proportion (or percentage) of the sample
that’s defective.
 np chart: The “np” stands for the number (or count) of defective items
in the sample.
 u chart: The “u” stands for the number of defects per unit in the sample.
 c chart: The “c” stands for the count of the defects from a sample.
Building a control chart
In this section, we walk you through the creation of a control chart with help
from what’s probably the most commonly used chart, an X-bar chart (see the
previous section). We use Microsoft Excel to build the chart because most
everyone has access to a copy of Excel.
Follow these steps to create an X-bar chart, using Microsoft Excel:
1. Collect the sample data (as we explain in Chapter 8) and insert it into
Excel.
See Figure 10-4 for an example. Each row in the spreadsheet represents a
sample of five measurements (the test number is indicated in column A),
with the measurements entered into columns B through F. In this case,
we’ve taken 20 different samples of 5 measurements each. The samples
could’ve been taken minutes apart or days apart — it depends on your
process.

Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

2. Calculate the statistic for the type of chart you’re creating.
In this case, you calculate the sample mean. Column G in Figure 10-4 uses
the AVERAGE function in Excel to calculate the average for each sample.
3. Calculate the mean for all the data collected.
In Figure 10-4, this value appears in cell G22. You calculate the figure by
using the AVERAGE function of all the sample mean data in column G.
4. Calculate the values for the control limits.
In Figure 10-4, the values for the upper and lower control limits (UCL and
LCL) appear in columns I and J. The formula for the UCL is
=$G$22+(3*STDEV($G$2:$G$21))
You’re using three sigma (or standard deviations) from the mean (stored
in cell G22) as your control limit. The lower limit is the same formula,
except that you subtract rather than add three sigma. The numbers 1
and 20 in column I represent the first and last test numbers to match up
with the sample data when you draw your chart.
5. Highlight the X-bar column from rows 1 through 21 and click the
Chart Wizard button (or choose Chart from the Insert menu if you
can’t find the Chart Wizard button). Select the XY Scatter chart with
data points connected, as shown in Figure 10-5.
This task creates the run chart on which your control chart will be based.
6. Create the chart and adjust the chart options to make your chart look
similar to the one in Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-5:
Use the
Chart
Wizard to
create an X-
bar control
chart.
166
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

7. Start adding the control limits with the average line (for this chart,
you go with the center line). Highlight the values for the average 
(cells I5 to J6) and then move your cursor to one of the borders of 
the highlighted numbers.
8. Right-click and drag your cursor to the data area of the chart and
release the mouse button. A dialog box will appear, as shown in
Figure 10-7. Check the options shown in Figure 10-7, and click OK.
9. Repeat Step 8 for the upper and lower control limits.
Your completed X-bar control chart should look like the one in Figure 10-8.

Now that the X-bar chart is complete, take a look at what we’ve presented in
Figure 10-8:
 The X-axis represents the sequence of samples that we took.
 The Y-axis represents the average (X-bar) for each set of samples we took.
 The center line on the chart represents the average of all the samples,
which, if we’ve set up our process correctly, should be the desired value
for each item made.
 The upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL) are the
two other horizontal lines on the chart.
 The points on the chart are the mean values for the samples we took,
each connected by a line.
To create a different chart, you simply substitute X-bar with the desired sta-
tistic and follow the same steps. For example, to create an R chart, you calcu-
late the range of each sample rather than the mean by changing column G to
range and using the following Excel formula for each sample to get the range:
=MAX(B2:F2)-MIN(B2:F2)
Fit the range of the values on the X-axis, and you end up with a chart like the
one shown in Figure 10-9.
We recommend easy-to-use software packages over Microsoft Excel for long-
term quality control use. Although Excel is capable of creating charts, using 
it on a production basis is difficult because the values must be updated and
the chart redone with each new measurement. Find out what others are 
using in your industry, or research available packages by using an Internet
search engine.

Reading a control chart
After you create one or more control charts, your next step is to evaluate what
the charts say about your process. The basic idea is that the process should
stay within the control limits; if it does, you conclude that the process is “in
control.” However, you need to look for other factors besides points outside
the control limits that may suggest that your process is guilty of some kind of
special-cause variation, which is a potential problem with your process (see
“Detecting different types of variation,” earlier in this chapter, for details).
Check out the following sections for tips on evaluating any control chart.
Here are a couple of important assumptions that control charts make about
the data that you plot:
 Each data point is independent from every other data point. This
means that you can’t predict future values from current values. The 
data you’re measuring isn’t affected by any value it held in the past.
 The data is normally distributed. This is statistic speak for “the data
will vary around the average, with the most values being closer to the
average.” As you get farther from the average, the frequency of data
decreases. (See “The importance of the normal curve,” earlier in this
chapter, for more information.)
Looking at both sides of the center line
Many forms of chart evaluation are based on statistical reasoning. For exam-
ple, you can examine where your data falls relative to the center line of the
chart. Because your sample should be clustered around the mean, there’s a
50-50 chance (0.5) that any single sample is above or below the center line.
Your samples are independent of each other, so the chance that two samples
fall on the same side of the center line is 0.5 × 0.5, or 25 percent. Therefore, it
stands to reason that if you get enough samples on the same side of the line
in a row, your process may have a problem.

Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

Here are some patterns to look for when evaluating your control chart:
 Seven points in a row on the same side of the line. This applies only 
to X-bar charts (see the section “Checking out different kinds of control
charts” earlier in this chapter). This occurrence is statistically improba-
ble and should be checked out.
 Six points in a row steadily increasing or decreasing. This is a good
indicator that a tool is wearing out.
 Fourteen points in a row alternating up and down. This can indicate
that two alternating factors are causing results to change, such as 
alternating operators.
 Any other unusual pattern that you can’t readily explain.
Zooming in on zones
One common evaluation practice is to divide a control chart into three
“zones” to look for patterns. You divide the area between the center line 
and each control limit into three zones, called A, B, and C:
 Zone C is the area between the center line and one sigma from the
center line (see the earlier section “Standard deviation” to figure out 
a particular sigma).
 Zone B is the area between one and two sigma from the center line.
 Zone A is the area between two and three sigma from the center line.
Here are some patterns to look for within the control chart zones:
 Two out of three points in a row in Zone A or beyond. This pattern
could mean that your whole process has shifted; that is, your process
has changed in one direction so that now your process mean is different.
 Four out of five points in a row in Zone B or beyond. Again, this 
pattern could mean that your whole process has shifted.
 Fifteen points in a row in Zone C. This pattern could indicate that your
process variability has changed. Such change isn’t necessarily a bad
thing; it could be an opportunity to tighten your control limits (see the
later section “Changing your control limits”).
Responding to different types of variation
After you detect a variation, what do you do about it? The first step is to
determine whether the variation is of the special-cause type (probably 
bad) or of the common-cause variety (probably okay). Your control charts
can alert you that you may have a problem, but by themselves they won’t
170
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

necessarily tell you what’s causing the problem. The techniques in the follow-
ing sections help you find the cause of the problem so you can fix it.
Don’t get so wrapped up in statistics that you forget why you’re doing all this
work: to detect variation in your process as quickly as possible so you have
time to get the process back on track before it starts making bad items.
Special-cause variation
If a production process that you examine with a control chart exhibits any of
the patterns we describe in the earlier section “Reading a control chart,” it
may be out of control due to a special-cause variation. If the special cause is
harmful (which is true in most cases), you need to eliminate it. If the special
cause is beneficial, you should identify it and make it an official part of your
process. The chart itself can’t tell you whether the special cause is good or
bad; you need to find the cause to make that determination.
You need to deal with special causes as quickly as possible while any unusual
circumstances that may have created the special causes are fresh in your
quality team’s minds. Follow these steps when you discover a possible 
special cause:
1. Fix any problems or damage immediately. At this stage, you provide
only a short-term fix until you can get to the real cause of the issue. Be
careful not to make a long-term fix too quickly. For example, if a tool is
wearing out, a short-term fix is to replace the part; a long-term solution
may involve changing the process so the part wears out less frequently.
2. Search for the cause of the variation. Interview everyone involved in
the production process to find out if anything unusual occurred that
may explain the variation. Be careful not to blame individuals because
you’ll want their cooperation in the future. Keep careful records about
the process under examination, as this problem or a similar one may
occur again in the future.
3. Develop a long-term solution after you identify the special cause for
the variation. Remove the special cause if it has a negative effect on
your process. Make the special cause an official part of your process if it
has a positive impact.
Common-cause variation
What if your process doesn’t exhibit any of the special-cause variation we dis-
cuss in the earlier section “Reading a control chart”? Does that mean you can
just kick back and enjoy the view? Of course not! Your process may be consis-
tent and still produce bad products or services. What if we told you that you
could reduce even the common-cause variation in your process so that you
could increase your quality and lower the cost? Yep, we thought you’d be
interested. Although achieving this feat is harder than finding and eliminating
special-cause variation, you may just find the process very worthwhile.
171
Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

Even with processes that are working well, businesses can usually find plenty
of good ideas floating around in employees’ heads. If only someone would
just ask! Here are three commonly used processes for finding and eliminating
common-cause variation:
 Stratification of data is simply the separation of data in categories
(Chapter 8 has an overview of stratification). You can use stratification
on different categories and levels within categories to search for pat-
terns. Categories can consist of a single variable, such as production by
machine, or multiple variables, such as shifts and assembly lines.
Be careful not to read too much into stratification by taking small differ-
ences between categories too seriously. Only the larger differences are
worthy of your attention. Also, don’t assume that any differences you
find are automatically the cause of the problem with your process; the
categories you identify may not hold the actual problem, only clues to
the actual cause.
 Experimentation is the concept of testing a theory about the cause of a
problem, even though you have little or no data to support your theory.
In Statistical Process Control, you use the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle (or
PDCA cycle), first described by Walter Shewhart and made popular by 
W. Edwards Deming (a student of Shewhart and a famous quality guru in 
his own right). The cycle is really nothing more than taking a scientific
method that’s been around for several centuries and applying it to qual-
ity control. The PDCA cycle uses experimentation and observation to dis-
cover the root causes of quality problems; Chapter 3 has more details.
You can repeat experimentation over and over to make continuous
improvements to your production process. It requires both creative and
analytic thinking to move past how your organization handles produc-
tion today to come up with new and innovative solutions.
 Disaggregation is the process of breaking down a process into its individ-
ual components in order to isolate the cause of a problem. You can use
the tactic in tandem with either experimentation or stratification to
uncover problems that may not be apparent within your process when
examined as a whole. Think of disaggregation as a way to see the forest
and the trees at the same time. For example, if you’re evaluating the qual-
ity of classroom instruction for a particular subject, you may need to
break the data down further by teacher to reach the cause of the problem.
You need to make sure that you don’t optimize a single part of the
process at the expense of the final objective of the process. For example,
if you speed up the process of making pizzas for delivery faster than you
can deliver the pizzas, you haven’t really improved the entire process of
making and delivering pizzas to your customers.
172
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Changing your control limits
When you find a good special-cause variation that needs to stay in place in
your process, you need to recalculate the control limits on your SPC charts
(see the section “Building a control chart” earlier in this chapter). The
change could be based on something you detect in the process, such as one
of the data patterns we discuss in the earlier section “Reading a control
chart,” or it could be due to a new variable you introduce into the process,
such as the implementation of a new machine or a new supplier.
In Statistical Process Control, you’re more interested in the future actions 
of the process than the past, and you need to change the control limits to
reflect any new realities. Being able to recalculate the control limits is a bene-
fit of SPC, because the concept recognizes that your processes will change
over time (for better or worse). Hopefully, the changes will represent the
gradual improvements you make in your production processes.
After you determine that a change is an improvement, recalculate the control
limits just like you did when you calculated them initially, using only data col-
lected since the time the improvement occurred (see the section “Building a
control chart,” earlier in this chapter, for details).
Calculating Process Capability
In addition to figuring out whether a production or service-delivery process
is making the right stuff, an important concept of Statistical Process Control
is that of process capability. Process capability is an indicator of how well a
process is running. The major pieces of information that process capability
highlights are
 Whether a process is capable of producing products or services that
conform to customer specifications
 The variability in the characteristics of a process
Process capability attempts to answer the question “Is my organization’s 
production or service-delivery process good enough?” You need to be aware
of the difference between staying within the control limits (see the section
“Control limits” earlier in this chapter) and conforming to your customers’
specification limits. Process capability recognizes the following:
173
Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

 If a process is in control, almost all data points will fall within the control
limits (see the earlier section “Reading a control chart”).
 The customer usually prescribes specification limits, which aren’t up for
discussion (see Chapter 6 for details on discovering customer desires).
 Staying within a control chart’s limits doesn’t guarantee that your 
organization will always meet customer specifications.
In the following sections, we present a formula for identifying your process’s
capability and explain the importance of matching your mean as closely as
possible to customer specifications.
Identifying a process’s capability
You measure a process’s capability by using a statistic called the capability
index (CP). It shows how well your process can meet customer specifications.
You calculate the capability index with the following formula:
CP = customer-specified range ÷ (6 × sigma)
The control limits for the capability index are three standard deviations (or
sigma) above and below the center line (which is where the [6 × sigma] in the
CP equation comes from).
The capability index tells you how comfortably a process fits within the con-
trol limits you set. To picture this, think about a control chart and its center
line (refer to Figure 10-8 for a handy example):
 If all the data points are close to the center line — not out near the
upper or lower control limit — you can conclude that the process is
very capable.
 If you see numerous data points close to the control limits, you can con-
clude that the process is barely capable.
 If some data points go beyond the control limits, you can conclude that
the process isn’t very capable.
The capability index tells you mathematically which of the three previous sit-
uations applies to your process. The higher the CP, the more capable the
process. Use Table 10-1 to evaluate the CP value that you calculate.
174
Part II: Putting Fundamental Quality Control Methods to Use 

Table 10-1
Evaluating Process Capability
Amount of CP
Evaluation
CP < 1
The variation in the process exceeds customer specifica-
tions; you’re making a large number of defective items.
CP = 1
The process is barely meeting customer specifications;
you’re making some defective items.
CP > 1
The variation in the process is less than customer specifica-
tions; you’re making few, if any, defective items.
Earlier in this chapter, we calculated the standard deviation of a set of mea-
surements (6, 8, 7, 9, and 10) as 1.58. If the customer has specified an upper
specification value of 10 and a lower specification value of 5, you calculate
the CP as follows:
CP = (10 – 5) ÷ (6 × 1.58)
CP = 5 ÷ 9.48 = 0.53
Because your CP of 0.53 is less than 1, the variation in your process exceeds
customer specifications; you’re making a large number of defective parts.
The capability index works well if your data points in a control chart are pretty
evenly spread above and below the center line. However, if your data points
appear more on one side of the center line than the other due to the nature of
the process, use the following formula to determine process capability:
(Upper customer specified range – mean) ÷ (3 × sigma)
(Mean – lower customer specified range) ÷ (3 × sigma)
In plain English, what you’re doing is calculating one figure by using only the
upper value for the customer specified range and another figure with the
lower value for the customer specified range. After your calculations, you use
the smaller of the two calculations as your capability index. Use Table 10-1 to
determine if your process is capable.
Moving a process closer to 
customer specifications
In the earlier section “Using Control Charts Effectively,” we talk about reduc-
ing the variation in a production process as much as possible. After you get
the variation under control, your next step is to make sure that the mean
175
Chapter 10: Assessing Quality with Statistical Process Control

value of your process (determined with a control chart) is as close to your
customers’ desired value as possible. Look for ways to shift your process
curve until it comes close to the requirements, as shown in Figure 10-10.
You may shift your process by installing new equipment, providing better
training for your employees, or simplifying steps to make mistakes less likely.
As with other adjustments you make to improve your process, make small
changes and measure their effects instead of making big changes all at once.

Lean Processes

In this part . . .
A
Lean organization is one that has examined its
processes and squeezed all the waste out of them.
The company minimizes work-in-process materials and
focuses the entire workforce on continuous improvement.
Achieving Lean status is a tall order and takes companies
many years to accomplish. They constantly dig deeper
into why processes are the way they are and work to
make them the way they ought to be. In this part, we
introduce the general concept of Lean and provide handy
tips on implementing specific Lean methods.
The first action of Lean, after implementing Value Stream
Mapping for a clear view of your current process, is to
clean up the workplace. Some workers never let go of any
materials, causing junk to pile high and obscure the work
that needs to be done. Using a process called 5S, you can
clean out workplaces and organize them for efficient action
and quick changeover. If a particularly troublesome area
is holding up important work, a Rapid Improvement Event
can quickly 5S an area and implement Lean concepts at
the same time. This one-week event is fast-paced and
requires considerable planning, but we prepare you here.
Last but not least: An area that many companies labor with
is minimizing the amount of on-site materials. Kanban is a
technique for minimizing work-in-process materials and
for rapidly responding to customer requests that always
circulate as “hot jobs.” We show you the Kanban way here.

 Understanding why asking “Why?” improves processes
P
eople in the business world have tossed around the term “Lean
processes” ever since Japanese automakers seized a large share of the
North American market by using them. The idea behind going Lean is simple.
A non-Lean (fat?) process is bloated with waste. Waste lowers product or ser-
vice quality and increases cost, much like buying food and drink at a ball-
game or concert. A Lean process, therefore, focuses on customer satisfaction
and cost reduction by eliminating waste.
In this chapter, you find out about the principles behind Lean processes, 
different types of waste in organizations, and mapping a process to reveal
wasteful tendencies. You also find out about two important tools in Lean
processes: Takt Time and the 5 “Why’s.”
Chapters 13, 14, and 15 go into more detail on several important Lean con-
cepts: 5S, Rapid Improvement Events (RIEs), and Lean Materials and Kanban.
You also can check out Lean For Dummies, by Bruce Williams and Natalie
Sayer (Wiley), for more intensive information.
Boning Up on the Lean Basics
You can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. Likewise, changing a
company’s actions from current practices to Lean processes requires some
changes. But before you break any eggs, take a few moments to understand

the foundations of Lean and how you may apply the concept to your busi-
ness. In the following sections, you discover the principles that guide Lean,
the major steps for implementing Lean, and the pros and cons of going Lean.
Considering Lean cornerstones
Many companies have embraced the concept of Lean as a reaction to poor
customer response or as a preventive measure to always produce high-quality
products and satisfy customers. Some choose to implement selected Lean
tools in particular segments of their businesses. Others make Lean a corner-
stone of their company cultures. Although the Lean approaches and results
may differ, all Lean initiatives have a couple of elements in common. A Lean
process
 Continuously focuses on the elimination of waste
 Always strives to exceed customer expectations
These two fundamentals — waste elimination and exceeding customer 
expectations — are the keystones within Lean processes.
“Muda,” the Japanese word for waste, is most often recognized in the busi-
ness world as time, effort, material, and information that don’t add value for
the customer; therefore, they don’t add value to the process they’re involved
with (see Chapter 12 for more about nonvalue additions). You meet and
exceed customer expectations when you eliminate waste. To the customer,
improvement may be reflected in
 Improved cycle times (the length of time required from receiving an
order to delivering it)
 Reduced pricing
 Increased quality levels
Within the organization, you can see the effects of Lean in
 Reduced inventory levels
 Cost improvement
 Reduced space requirements
Other principles support the elimination of waste and the goal of exceeding
customer expectations. These principles include careful planning of produc-
tion schedules, prompt attention to quality problems, and worker involve-
ment (they often have the best ideas).
180
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Taking important steps for 
getting Lean and mean
The steps in the following sections support your organization’s Lean journey.
Your organization needs to address all the steps, but the sequence in which
you move and the emphasis you place on the different steps depends on your
specific situation.
An organization can view processes at the micro level, such as the process of
answering a phone, or from a broader perspective, such as the process of
taking a customer order. Lean tools, when implemented in an established
company, are best applied at the micro level. A company can attempt to
tackle higher-level processes after it Leans some of the component processes.
As the company Leans its processes, it may evolve into a Lean enterprise.
The company shouldn’t view the transformation as a one-time initiative;
instead, it should adopt a long-term, enterprise-wide view of all processes.
Lean operating principles become the overall culture of the organization,
with the elimination of waste as the target for improvement based on exceed-
ing customer expectations.
Agree on areas to target
Before you target certain processes for Lean, you should start by addressing
the core value stream of the organization. The important thing for Lean is
that the top executives agree on the areas to target and involve themselves in
the process of the change. This agreement and involvement does two things:
 It demonstrates the commitment of the leaders.
 It allows the leaders to identify waste in the organization’s core processes.
All workers involved in the Lean movement should view the changes from the
perspective of changing the culture of the organization and demonstrating a
“bias for action.”
Here’s some advice for company leaders: Take the time to do your homework
before you jump in. There’s plenty more to becoming Lean than just imple-
menting a single tool or changing a single process. People have written books
on the process of implementing Lean, and legions of consultants, integrators,
and other professionals are ready to help (see Chapter 5 for details on finding
these folks). Talk with other companies that are sound examples of Lean
enterprises or are solidly on their way; most of these organizations will be
willing to share their experiences. Benchmarking is an excellent way to find
out about the processes that support Lean organizations.
181
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

You shouldn’t copy exactly what other successful Lean companies have done.
No executives or workers want to repeatedly hear that “this is the way
Company X does it.” Internalize the change, and make it your culture. Your
objective is to become a “learning organization.” Nurture and develop your
leaders from within; you’ll need them to grow.
Install Lean leaders
Most successful Lean transitions have the support of a Lean “guru” — someone
who serves as a mirror to the actions of the enterprise to make sure changes
always move in a Lean direction. The guru may be a top leader; at a minimum,
the guru should be a leader recognized for his or her ability to influence others.
Many companies bring in an expert from the outside. This expert is considered
to be a neutral party and isn’t initially associated with any internal faction.
Be careful that outsourcing a guru doesn’t send the wrong signal to the cur-
rent leadership group. If you send a message that the only path to success is
to enter from the outside, your company may begin to lose knowledgeable,
talented, experienced leaders.
Chapter 5 has more details on selecting a sponsor for quality initiatives.
Implement communication and training
Communicating information about Lean throughout your organization is
important. Lean is a change from the traditional manufacturing mindset. It’s
important that all workers be trained on understanding and applying Lean
techniques, that early examples of success be made available to illustrate
how Lean works, and that all workers maintain a dialogue so that positive
experiences are shared and misunderstandings about Lean are corrected.
Unfortunately, managers often think that informing employees about Lean
changes leads directly to action — it seldom does. You need to supplement
your communication with training. Your workers need to understand the
information you present. Look for commitment. Write down and post agree-
ments. You can train effectively in a chalkboard environment, but nothing
beats hands-on learning. Use training sessions as a means of supporting the
changes you make in a process. Encourage managers and executives to roll
up their sleeves and get involved in implementing or supporting the changes.
Chapter 5 has details on communicating your quality intentions and training
employees on quality methods.
Concentrate on value streams
Most organizations are structured along functional lines. However, the prod-
ucts or services created run across various departments, so examining how
departments work doesn’t help. Examine the key value streams of your enter-
prise. What’s the primary value of your product or service to the customer? If
182
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

you provide multiple products or services, which ones provide the greatest
profit or are the most important to your company?
After you identify the value streams, you can select one to improve. For
example, an assembly line operator working on the main value stream must
be your primary focus for support. As important as researching new technol-
ogy may be, it isn’t the main value stream in this case. You begin concentrat-
ing on Leaning your value stream with the receipt of customer requests and
finish with delivery of the product or service.
Strong, seemingly functional departments that have great value to your orga-
nization may resist Lean changes. Skillful leadership is required to bring the
team together in pursuit of what’s best for the overall process.
Select metrics that reflect overall performance to focus on as an organization.
Dealing with too many micro metrics will muddle the Lean transition. Keep all
eyes on the overall performance measurements.
Develop process maps as a guide
A process map is a picture that shows how a product, a piece of information,
or a service is transitioned to a finished good. The map begins with a specific
event and ends with a specific deliverable. Creating a process map that docu-
ments how a process currently operates — a current state map — helps to make
waste more visible. The current state map also forms the basis for describing
where you plan to go — the future state — and ultimately describes what would
be the ideal state for your process and deliverable product or service.
Making the current state of a process visible with a process map is a great
way to identify waste and make immediate change. The current state should
show where problems are in terms of defects, wasted time, wasted money,
and so on. A visible future state map helps everyone involved in the process
understand where your organization plans to go. The future state should
depict the solutions in terms of goals for reducing defects, time, and cost.
Any changes you make to a process should always move toward the ideal
state, or your organization’s ultimate goal for improvement.
See the section “Identifying the Seven Wastes That Can Plague a Process,”
later in this chapter, to find out how to identify waste. Also, Chapter 12 dis-
cusses the concept of drawing a picture of your process.
Focus on waste elimination
You can use several Lean tools to focus your organization’s attention on
waste elimination. You can structure process mapping (see the previous sec-
tion) and 5S workshops (see Chapter 13), for instance, in a cross-functional
Kaizen event. (Kaizen is the Japanese word for continuous improvement; see
Chapter 14 for more about Kaizen events, also known as Rapid Improvement
Events.) Chapter 15 discusses another option: Lean Materials.
183
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

Waste elimination is a cornerstone of a Lean enterprise, not a one-time exer-
cise (see the earlier section “Considering Lean cornerstones”). Processes are
constantly fine-tuned to optimize performance through worker suggestions
for ways to eliminate waste. It never ends.
Follow up to ensure that improvements are sustained
Conducting a successful Lean event, where you eliminate the waste from a
process to make a better product or service, is a great first step. However,
you shouldn’t let the success slip away; not being fully committed to the new
process will send the wrong message to your organization and industry. Your
leaders must demonstrate commitment at the line level, with managers as the
change leaders, and the top leadership group should show its support.
You have several ways to ensure that fixed processes remain fixed, including
the following:
 The work team conducts a review one week after the change is made to
discuss any new problems that the change may have created. Some
companies do this again after four weeks.
 Update all the process work instructions to use the revised process.
 Implement performance metrics based on how well the process per-
formed after the change. Update these measurements weekly, and post
the results over time. If performance isn’t improving, a supervisor must
investigate why.
Successes make good models. Use successes within and outside of your orga-
nization as examples your workers can observe to better understand Lean
concepts. Interview employees about what they’ve done to reinforce the
lessons learned and to sustain results.
Weighing the pros and cons of Lean
Lean techniques can transform a sluggish company into a more profitable
dynamo. However, introducing something new is always disruptive. If the
change is poorly done, the disruption can be serious; the entire change (the
good with the bad) is discarded, and life returns to the old way. So, you
should focus on the good, work toward the good, and avoid the bad. The fol-
lowing sections cover the good and the bad of Lean.
The pros
Lean processes produce four primary types of benefits, the first of which
leads to the latter three:
 Elimination of waste
 Improved quality
184
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 Reduced lead time
 Reduced total costs
These four benefits are the classic goals of many quality initiatives outside of
Lean process improvements.
Other advantages of Lean include the following:
 An organization can apply Lean techniques to all types of processes.
 In most cases, changing to Lean doesn’t require an increase in capital
costs — it simply calls for the reassignment of people to more produc-
tive purposes.
 Lean processes uncover deficiencies in production planning and materi-
als management that were hidden (and unaddressed) in current
processes.
 Lean energizes workers as they see how it simplifies their work.
The cons
Transitioning to Lean processes has many benefits, but the road to molding a
Lean enterprise can be littered with disadvantages:
 As with any quality change, a certain level of support is required when
implementing Lean initiatives — particularly amongst employees. From
the line workers to the executive ranks, everyone should be supportive
of the Lean changes, or at least not resistant to them. Recognizing the
need for change within a successful organization isn’t easy. The classic
attitude, “If it’s not broken, don’t fix it,” is prevalent in many successful
organizations. (See Chapter 5 for more on getting employee support.)
 Sculpting a well-functioning Lean process, though it may seem quite
simple, is complicated. Lean thinking isn’t necessarily natural for most
businesspeople. An organization that wants to be Lean must become a
learning organization, willing to take measured risks and grow. Transi-
tioning to a Lean enterprise requires that all employees are properly
trained, educated, and supported. Managers need to be hands-on imple-
menters of Lean initiatives and willing to sustain process improvement.
Executives need to adopt long-term strategies that move the entire
enterprise to become Lean. All these requirements seem daunting, but
they’re worth it in the end.
 Lean isn’t suitable for processes that require a high degree of craftsman-
ship. Artisanship takes time; a creative process trades inefficiency for
creative results.
If key executives in your company aren’t willing or can’t make the commit-
ment to Lean processes, consider limiting your Lean transformation to a
short-term implementation of Lean tools.
185
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

Identifying the Seven Wastes 
That Can Plague a Process
The elimination of waste is one of the keystones of Lean processes, making it
the perfect place to start a Lean transformation. To eliminate waste in your
processes, you need to understand how to identify waste. You may think that
you know waste when you see it, but you’ll have a much smoother transition
if you understand a few key issues and agree on types of waste. Note: Be care-
ful not to label everything that a manager doesn’t like about a process as
“waste.” This type of insincere action undermines the process of change.
The seven types of waste in the following sections serve as the common
framework in defining waste. Chapters 12 through 15 include helpful methods
you can use to eliminate these wastes.
The seven kinds of waste grew out of the Toyota Production System (TPS). As
a result, their descriptions and many of the examples rely on manufacturing
processes. With the evolution of Lean and other quality improvement tech-
niques, the business world has transitioned to looking at the overall supply
chain, service industries, and other areas for waste. Examining a supply chain
simply requires looking outside the four walls of a factory and recognizing the
movement from facility to facility, utilizing different forms of transport. When
you look at a production facility, the product flows from machine to machine
and process to process; the end result is the delivery of a quality product to
the customer. The same is true of a service. The product may not be as visi-
ble, but the process still involves a flow that ultimately adds value. Waste is
still waste, whether it exists inside a small workstation or around the world.
Some experts add an eighth type of waste: the underutilization of skilled em-
ployees. Why use the time of a skilled tradesman, manager, or data-processing
technician for performing simple clerical work? Every employee must do
some portion of simple documentation, but in some cases, paperwork can
consume a skilled person’s day.
Waste of overproduction
Overproduction occurs any time a process makes more of a product or part
than what the next customer in line needs. Overproduction is one of the most
prevalent types of waste, but it can be difficult to recognize. This makes it the
perfect place to start identifying and eliminating waste. Want another reason
to start here? Getting rid of overproduction is likely to yield some of the
greatest rewards.
186
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

If you’re involved in manufacturing, you should look for piles of inventory. If a
process creates large batches with the intention of yielding high productivity,
the result is a single operation that experiences high productivity while sub-
sequent processes waste time handling products that they don’t need. Another
common place for waste is in areas where you store stationary supplies. How
many places can you find an inventory of lined pads waiting for use? Start
with the people who use the pads and work back to the source. You’ll proba-
bly find many drawers and cabinets devoted to storing this material. What
about pens, forms, e-mail, files, and so on?
The rationale for overproducing is often protection and efficiency. No com-
pany wants to run out of an item. Executives may believe that processing in
large batches is efficient for the overall process. Both of these justifications,
however, run counter to even production flow and producing to the cadence
of customer demand (see the later section “Moving to the Beat of Takt Time”
for more about Lean production rates). In the case of protection, overproduc-
tion masks other problems, such as poor supplier quality (internal and exter-
nal). For more on having too much inventory, see Chapter 15.
Waste of waiting
The waste of waiting is pretty self-explanatory. You can easily spot people
standing around, not being productive. In fact, most managers have personal
experience with this type of waste. Have you ever been the customer waiting
in a checkout line, wandering through a store looking for an item, or waiting
on the phone for assistance? Quality teams can identify this type of waste in
manufacturing, service, administration, and all other environments.
Eliminating waiting allows workers to focus on their jobs.
Waiting is a topic that many employees will freely identify and discuss. How
many times have they complained about waiting for someone or something
to appear? They may be waiting for a PC technician, for parts delivery, or
even for a decision from a manager. In some cases, other work can fill the
time, but other times, the waiting results in idle workers.
Another sad consequence of the waste of waiting is when employees act busy
to avoid the appearance of waiting. By doing other non-value-adding activi-
ties (see Chapter 12 for details), employees create another form of less-visi-
ble waste. The common executive decree, “Don’t just stand there — do
something,” often compels workers to trade one form of waste for another.
On occasion, waiting can be difficult to avoid — especially in processes that
feature a high degree of variation to the inputs. You do, however, have ways
to make the best of wasteful situations. One way is to provide secondary
187
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

work that isn’t time-essential. When primary work isn’t available, workers
begin on secondary efforts, such as assembling small components and resup-
plying other workers in continuous effort assignments.
Waste of unnecessary transportation
Transportation waste is time (labor), equipment, and floor space spent shuf-
fling material around. Perhaps the best way to analyze transportation waste
is to identify the shortest/quickest path when moving from the start of a
process to the end. You can identify the following as waste on the journey:
 Places where workers stack material in one place for a while, move it to
where people will eventually use it in the process, and then move it to
the point of application. Each of these moves takes time and equipment.
 Long distances between where the material enters the facility and where
workers use it. It’s time consuming to truck materials from the rear
docks of a two-million-square-foot factory to the front area.
Look for the following clues of unnecessary transportation waste in different
workplaces:
 Manufacturing: Wasted transportation may take the form of conveyors
that move products long distances, when locating departments closer
together would be a better method of operation. Just because an item is
on a conveyor doesn’t mean that the process isn’t wasteful. Machines
such as conveyors may eliminate the need for operators to move the
material, but they require maintenance and aren’t flexible tools.
Movement of overproduction to holding areas is another common waste-
ful transportation move in manufacturing. The more overproduction you
have, the more space and transportation you require to handle the situa-
tion. (I cover the waste of overproduction earlier in this chapter.)
 Service, administration, and other soft-product processes: When an
office responsible for handling paper isn’t in close proximity to opera-
tors who handle products, a form of transportation must move the
paper back and forth. This slows the updating of records, which nega-
tively impacts cycle times. All the handoffs in a process — between
employees, departments, and organizations — are potential areas for
transportation waste.
Eliminating transportation waste provides several financial benefits:
 It eliminates the steady flow of forklifts from the warehouse to various
points on the shop floor. Similarly, it eliminates long conveyors that
move material long distances around the facility. Both are expensive to
purchase and maintain.
188
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 It eliminates the labor spent moving material to an endless string of
interim stops.
 It provides many benefits under the waste of eliminating excess inven-
tory, which is covered later in this chapter.
Waste from unneeded processing steps
Be careful that a Kaizen project (see Chapter 14) you undertake isn’t Leaning
an unnecessary process step. It isn’t uncommon for a business to identify
very efficient tasks that don’t add value to the overall process. Eliminating
process steps is a great area for checking customer expectations. Ever received
a report and sent it straight to a file or the trash? Stop producing a report for
a while to see if anyone notices. If an action doesn’t add value to a product or
service in the eyes of the customer, stop doing it!
In manufacturing operations, the flow of material and products is visible. Waste
within the process is often visible, too, particularly to outsiders who are likely
to ask why something operates the way it does. Identifying waste in information
processing is a bit more difficult, although the opportunities are greater. Creat-
ing a report that’s simple and to the point may be difficult, but creating a com-
plicated report or analysis is not only wasteful for the preparer, but also takes
added (wasted) time for the recipient to digest and understand the information.
When eliminating waste, look for unnecessary reviews and approvals. One
common step to avoid action is to further analyze or question pieces of data.
Looking at all the steps in a process and asking “why” is a great way to identify
and eliminate waste (find out more about asking “why” later in this chapter).
Eliminating unneeded processing provides immediate benefits:
 Reduced labor costs: More time is available for productive labor.
 Reduced defects: Each step in a process is a chance to do something
wrong. The fewer steps a process has, the fewer chances workers have
to make mistakes.
 Reduced material costs: This applies if the eliminated steps used 
materials.
Waste of excess inventory
Excess inventory is material beyond what’s needed for the task at hand. In a
perfect one-piece flow process, cadenced to customer demand (see the later
section “Moving to the Beat of Takt Time” for details), you see no excess
inventory; all the inventory is in the process, moving toward the customer. Of
course, a perfect state rarely exists, so you must view most of the inventory
in your processes as waste that you need to reduce and possibly eliminate.
189
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

When walking through your factory, warehouse, office, or other place of busi-
ness, look around for piles or stashes of inventory. In a factory or warehouse
setting, excess inventory may appear as raw material or other process inputs.
It also may appear as goods and services that workers are processing or that
are finished and awaiting use. Outside the factory or warehouse, check file
cabinets for excess supplies, obsolete information, and other forms of waste.
And keep in mind that inventory isn’t just in the form of physical products.
Documents, forms, tools, and other items are inventory.
Eliminating excess inventory provides some benefits:
 Excess inventory represents money spent by the company to purchase
materials and, if the material is partly finished, the labor to create that
component. Less inventory means less money spent.
 Excess inventory must be stored and tracked somehow. Less inventory
requires less storage and tracking.
Perhaps the most damaging waste associated with excess inventory is that it
hides problems. Excess inventory often covers for poor product quality; com-
panies stock more because some of the material is defective. When supply
processes aren’t dependable (shipments aren’t on time, aren’t delivered
properly, and so on), companies can stock more to cover for this inadequacy.
These and other problems remain hidden by excess inventory. As your orga-
nization implements Lean processes and reduces inventories, be prepared to
address the problems that inevitably surface. (For more on eliminating
excess inventory, see Chapter 15 on Lean Materials.)
Waste of unnecessary motion
Unnecessary motion is excess movement by an operator. The waste may be as
extreme as requiring an employee to walk a long distance to obtain supplies
rather than storing them within easy reach. Or, the waste may be as simple as
the operator having to sort through an unorganized or improperly marked
file to obtain required information.
You can find wasted motion in manufacturing operations as well as in clerical
or administrative tasks. As you walk through a process, ask yourself:
 Can you find cluttered work surfaces where tools don’t sit in well-
marked locations?
 Are telephones located in convenient spaces so that employees can
easily reach them, or do they have to make uncomfortable movements
to answer calls?
 Do you have pens and paper on hand for recording required information?
190
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Excess motion not only wastes time, but also presents a safety and ergonomic
issue that negatively impacts the health of employees. An electrical extension
cord, stretched across the room from an overhead projector to the nearest
electrical outlet, requires employees to take extra care to avoid injury. A mis-
take here may damage the projector or may injure the employee in a fall.
Other actions, such as straining to see a computer screen or typing from an
improper position, may lead to ergonomic problems.
Tired workers make mistakes. They’re grumpy and no fun to work with. Time
spent studying worker motions and providing assistance is always appreci-
ated. Most companies have a staff engineer trained in ergonometric studies
to identify and resolve problems.
Injured workers also cost companies money. Lifting heavy objects, which
leads to twisted backs and sore knees, adds up to worker fatigue and more
defects. Happy workers are far more productive than hurting, tired ones.
Waste of defective products
A defective product is one that doesn’t meet the customer’s requirements.
Creating a defective product is wasteful enough, but attempting to correct a
defect is pure waste. The extra waste begins with the inspection process. The
added time taken to inspect may prevent a defective product from reaching
the customer, but the effort is still wasteful. After the inspection detects the
defect, you must expend extra energy correcting, reworking, and disposing.
All this is wasted time and effort to fix a defective product that you should’ve
created correctly in the first place. If the product is made right the first time,
you have no need to inspect it (see Chapter 4 for more on inspection).
The worst possible situation occurs when the customer detects the problem.
You now must deal with the customer’s dissatisfaction. Corrective action is
often much more difficult than finding a problem before it reaches the cus-
tomer. A product return routinely costs four times what the delivery process
sets you back. Unless your business has a huge profit margin, return and
replacement of a defective product is a sure path to loss. Inspection, though
wasteful, is surely a better option until the process can be improved to create
defect-free products.
A much Leaner process is one that’s “error-proofed.” Ever started to complete
the assembly-required step after purchasing a product only to find that one 
of the nuts or bolts is missing from the baggie containing all the parts? Not a
pleasant situation. The company could address the problem with packaging
that has a specific slot for each item. Perhaps the company doesn’t perfectly
error-proof the process, but its solution does make a problem more visible.
Having standardized, documented work processes is another tool in preventing
quality problems. Good Lean processes often require that you check quality
191
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

problems against the standardized work process to determine what created
an error. Attention to sound process design and adherence to the process are
essential if you want to produce a quality product and eliminate waste. (See
Chapter 3 for more about quality assurance.)
Everyone can think of products they’ve found to be defective. Likewise, they
can think of products they like and recommend to others as reliable. Benefits
of defect-free products include
 Reduced marketing costs through repeat customers
 Reduced or eliminated inspection costs (However, don’t eliminate
inspectors until after the process reliably produces defect-free products
or services.)
 Reduced liability because safety is built into every product, every time
Creating defect-free services is an entirely different animal than creating defect-
free products. Products can be mass-produced in advance, but service involves
an interaction with the customer each time, and each interaction is different.
Moving to the Beat of Takt Time
One of the key elements of a successful Lean process is the consistent flow of
work (parts or products) with minimal variation (in other words, minimal waste
and costly labor). For most organizations, having successful Lean processes
means that they set production to the cadence of customer demand — a con-
cept known as Takt Time. In the following sections, you find out how to calcu-
late customer demand to satisfy the army of consumers you serve, set Takt
Time for your processes, examine effective process design, and balance the
overall flow of your process in order to have successful Lean processes.
Listening to customer demand
Because the goal of Lean processes is to have a consistent process that
cadences production to customer demand, you need to understand customer
demand. This may sound easy, but it isn’t. Many businesses operate in a
“Push” environment, where the goal is to keep machines busy churning out
the products. These companies rely on sales teams to influence demand and
somehow sell what the companies have produced. Other organizations must
wait for demand. In the service industry, companies maintain a certain amount
of inventory as buffers and then replenish the buffers as customers consume
them. The service adds value to the customer by being immediately available.
(See Chapter 6 for more on the voice of the customer and Chapter 15 for
more on a Push environment.)
192
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

You can observe a wide variety of customer-demand requirements in manu-
facturing and service industries. Different companies take varying approaches
to satisfying customer demand. What separates a Lean enterprise is that it
focuses first on customer requirements (demand) and then sets up its produc-
tion processes to satisfy the customer, all without creating waste.
You can estimate customer demand in a variety of ways (all of which are indi-
cators and no guarantee of success):
 Market projections for total demand, usually published by industry groups
 Age of existing customer equipment
 Information from customers (from a vehicle like a survey)
Many enterprises are internally focused. They set production based on a vari-
ety of internal metrics (production targets, inventory turnover, budgets, fore-
casts, and so on). Internal metrics aren’t bad things; in fact, they’re often key
tools within Lean enterprises. However, metrics should be secondary to
focusing on customer demand.
Setting the process tempo and 
considering process design
When you have a grasp on your customers’ requirements, you can set the
tempo of your processes to satisfy your customers (and avoid waste or leav-
ing your customers without the necessary supply). Companies that fail to do
this find themselves with piles of finished goods that their customers don’t
want. Here’s how you can calculate Takt Time to set a process tempo:
Total available work time per shift or per day ÷ Customer demand per
shift or per day
For example, say your customers purchase 16,800 units per month, and your
process works 20 days per month. You must produce 840 units per day. If
your workday has 7 productive hours (or 420 minutes), you must produce
one unit every 30 seconds. This is the overall rate of production when all
your processes are connected. However, each task doesn’t necessarily create
a single piece every 30 seconds.
See Figure 11-1 for an example of examining a process design. Within a Takt
Time of 30 seconds, you can evaluate different processes to see which ones
need adjustments to satisfy customer demand. For this example, all the units of
production must first go through Process A, and it takes five minutes to com-
plete this process. Ten workstations perform Process A to produce a unit every
30 seconds. You can follow the chronological thought process that ensues:
193
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

1. Following the flow, suppose 50 percent of the output from Process A
must go through Processes B and C, and the other 50 percent must go
through Process D.
2. If Process B can produce a unit every two minutes, Process C produces a
unit every 30 seconds. Four B workstations and one C workstation main-
tain the one-unit-in-30-seconds Takt Time.
3. However, you can see that Process D produces a unit in 0.4 minutes (or 24
seconds). This rate is faster than the Takt Time and needs to be adjusted.
The tempo of a process’s production depends on the design of the process.
Some processes take longer than others. For processes that can’t be com-
pleted faster, parallel workstations must be established to work on more than
one item at a time. If a facility has physical limitations on the rate that it can
produce an item (such as everything must pass through a single, very unique
machine), it can add additional work shifts to maximize this constraint (see
Chapter 19 for more about identifying and maximizing constraints).

Balancing for a smooth flow
All processes aren’t created equal, even in Lean operations. When you look at
your total operation, connecting all the necessary processes, you’re likely to
find that some of the processes have individual requirements.
Work in a process must be balanced for the smooth flow of products. The key
to balancing work is to understand all the work steps at each workstation.
Workflow smoothing should first try to eliminate all unnecessary movement.
Next, adjacent steps receive actions that they can perform without special
tools, in essence moving small slices of the work up- and downstream.
For example, Task 1 finishes work on an item and passes it to Task 2, but Task
1 can deliver items faster than Task 2 can complete them. To rebalance some
of the work, Task 1 takes on some of Task 2’s work. When Task 1 is finished
with an item, it now flips it over and orients it so that Task 2 can go right to
work, eliminating the need for Task 2 to do this. It’s a small action, but it
saves time.
Getting to the Heart of an 
Issue with the 5 “Why’s”
The 5 Why’s, a basic tool within Lean operations, is a problem-solving process
that encourages your organization to ask questions to discover the root cause
of a problem. The idea behind this tool is a fundamental cultural element of
Lean enterprises. Creating and maintaining an environment that truly values
asking “Why?” for the sake of continuous improvement is a major shift from
traditional business ways. It works to reverse the trend to fix blame on indi-
viduals. To use this tool, you don’t have to ask five specific questions; the
goal is simply to keep asking “Why?” about a problem until you find its cause.
In the following sections, you discover how to unearth the root of a problem,
and you go over ways to improve your company’s environment so that all
employees may feel free to ask questions.
Digging to find the real problem
When people encounter a problem, many immediately jump to a conclusion
and think that they have the solution. The first order of business when encoun-
tering a problem, however, is to boil down the situation to get a good idea of
195
Chapter 11: Gathering the Nuts and Bolts of Lean Processes

its basic cause. For instance, if a person finds an open gate that should be
closed, he or she may immediately assume that someone was careless. If the
person checks a bit further, however, he or she may discover that no instruc-
tions are in place that say “close the gate after entering.” Or, the gate may
have a latch that isn’t functioning properly. What this example tells you is
that asking “why” about the wrong cause won’t get you a good solution.
After you clearly define a problem, you can begin an investigation by asking,
“Why did this happen?” You won’t find anything magical about the “5” in the
5 Why’s. The tool is based on a belief that a single question can’t identify an
answer that’s the root cause of a problem. When you first ask “why,” the ini-
tial response describes a symptom. Asking another “why,” and so on, moves
the investigation closer to the root cause. Asking “why” five times is simply a
good rule of thumb; you may ask fewer or more times to discover a problem’s
cause.
Here’s an illustration to demonstrate how a company can use the 5 Why’s in
everyday operations. I (contributor Dennis Dreyer) worked at an automobile
manufacturer for over 34 years, always in the operations area of the business.
During this time, the company had a good reputation for focusing on safety. It
had safety talks on a regular basis, put up signs proclaiming the importance
of safety, and enforced all safety regulations. However, despite the company’s
efforts, employees still got injured, and on rare occasions the injuries were
fatal. To the company’s credit, its leadership realized that business as usual
wasn’t good enough.
To change the situation, the company implemented many new processes, and
the end result was a significant improvement in safety performance. One of 
the processes that the company turned to was the use of 5 Why’s for injuries.
The process required that employees evaluate all injuries against the 5 Why’s,
at which point a supervisor communicated the results to plant/division leader-
ship, generally within 24 hours. The situation went something like this, from
injury to corrective action:
Injury: Employee fell and sprained his right wrist.
Description: John Doe, a second-shift material handler, was walking to a
production workstation to deliver parts when he tripped and fell, injuring
his wrist. He was taken to a medical station and is expected to return to
work in one week. Further investigation revealed that a 16”-x-18”-x-4” box
of bearings, weighing 25 pounds, was on the floor, and it caused the
employee to trip.
Investigation:
1. Why was the box on the floor?
The maintenance department stores bearings there for rapid repair of
conveyors.
196
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

2. Why doesn’t maintenance store the bearings in a safe location, as desig-
nated by the workplace organization drawing?
Other items are overflowing from maintenance’s designated staging area
into the area designated for bearings.
3. Why are parts overflowing the designated area?
The designated area isn’t large enough.
4. Why is the other area not large enough?
Total workplace space limitations prevent maintenance from having ade-
quate storage space and from following the rules.
5. Why didn’t maintenance follow the rules?
The workplace isn’t well organized and needs to be redesigned.
Corrective action: All parts have been moved to their designated storage
spaces and a 5S workshop (see Chapter 13 for details) is scheduled for
next week.
Establishing a good environment 
for asking “why”
“Curiosity killed the cat,” as the saying goes. Unfortunately, in many situa-
tions, employees think that curiosity will kill their job status and retirement
benefits, too. Many employees don’t view curiosity as a good thing. Workers
may not see how asking questions improves the quality of the overall opera-
tion. It may take time for the culture of your company to evolve, but you need
to create a positive environment where everyone looks for ways to eliminate
waste and satisfy customer requirements. You may just have to remove a few
roadblocks before going down this path. Follow these guidelines to start off:
 Be sensitive that everyone likes to do a good job. Asking “why” may put
employees on the defensive. Ensure that they understand that the issue
is the process, not them or their work performance.
 Draw employees into the game. Work together to drive the “why’s” into
the process and figure out the issues. Jointly draft and sign process
improvement recommendations. No secrets!
 Publicly thank employees for their help.

Value Stream Mapping

 Identifying the value of process steps to create a future map
T
hey say that a picture is worth a thousand words. A visual image can
convey a complex idea or process much more effectively than words or
numbers. In Chapters 9 and 10, you see how graphs and charts can provide
useful information about your production process. But in your organization’s
zeal to improve the production parts of your process, you mustn’t forget that
what’s important is the sum of the parts of the entire process for delivering a
product to your customer.
The rub is that your customers’ only reason for interest in your company is
the product or service that you provide. The customers don’t care about how
good each step of your production process is or how magnificent your Pareto
charts look; they just want a product or service that meets their needs.
No worries: Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is here to bring your picture back
into focus. VSM is a process that allows you to see the big picture to make
sure that your entire process is focused on producing the best possible prod-
uct for the customer. VSM’s main purpose is to help you identify and elimi-
nate wasted time and effort. In this chapter, we explain the basics of VSM and
describe how to create several types of maps.
Sketching the Basics of 
Value Stream Mapping
All processes that create a product or service for an organization start with
inputs to the organization, where some sort of transformation takes place

and a finished product or service is delivered to the customer. Both material
and information make this transformation possible in most cases. For an
organization to achieve a high level of performance, and thus produce a prod-
uct or service that satisfies customer requirements, the flow of material and
information must be as efficient as possible. You should find no barriers or
wasteful practices to prevent material and information from moving
smoothly as they travel through the organization.
The benefits of having efficient processes include lower inventory levels,
reduced lead times (the total time it takes for the customer to receive the
product or service after the order is placed), and higher throughput (the
number of items made per unit of time).
Value Stream Mapping helps you analyze your processes to improve the flow
of material and information through your organization. VSM is basically a set
of tools you use to document your overall processes in a visual form that
makes it easy to see where barriers to flow clog up your processes. With the
information garnered from VSM, you can redesign your processes to elimi-
nate the clogs and wasteful practices.
In the following sections, we further define and describe VSM. We also go
over the steps of creating a map, and we present VSM’s pros and cons.
Breaking down the definition of VSM
So, what exactly is Value Stream Mapping? Take a look at the term one word
at a time:
 Value is what the customer is buying from you. Your product or service
must provide something of worth to the customer. You may need to
think beyond your immediate customer base to see the value you add.
 Stream is the process flow through your organization that turns inputs
into a product or service of value for the customer.
 Mapping is the action of documenting the value stream so that you can
analyze it to find areas to improve.
VSM is simply a set of tools that allow you to analyze your process flow by
presenting it in a visual form. The form enables you to look for ways to
redesign the process to eliminate barriers to the flow or identify waste in the
process — steps that don’t add value. Why go through all the hassle, your
superiors ask? Because you can reduce labor time, costs, loops, and so on.
200
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Examining important VSM attributes
VSM is similar to other process-charting techniques, such as flowcharting
(see Chapters 16 and 17), but it’s different in several important ways:
 A Value Stream Map contains data boxes for the inclusion of process-
flow metrics such as cycle time, changeover time (the time it takes to
alter a machine or workstation from making one product to another),
batch size, error rates, processing time, demand rate, percent complete,
work in progress (WIP), costs, inventory, and so on. A typical process
flowchart doesn’t include this specific metric information.
 Flowcharting typically focuses on employee processes, such as the
steps required to make an item or provide a service, whereas VSM
focuses on material and information flow in the manufacturing of prod-
ucts and on delivery for services.
 A flowchart often has a box for every action, whereas VSM combines all
steps where the material is continuously flowing.
 You can create a Value Stream Map, usually by hand, much quicker than
a typical process flowchart.
 A Value Stream Map looks across all processes, departments, and func-
tions. A flowchart is a detailed look at a single process.
 Flowcharts are used to document current processes; VSM requires that
you document both current and future state flows (see the section “To
the Drawing Board: Creating a Current State Map” for more on the cur-
rent state).
 VSM uses different icons to signify when the organization pushes along
material or services instead of the customer pulling. A flowchart typi-
cally uses a standard icon for all processes. (See the later section
“Eyeing icons” for more.)
Walking through the basic steps 
to create a Value Stream Map
The overall process for creating a Value Stream Map consists of five steps:
1. Build a cross-functional team to create the map.
To make sure that you cover everything that goes into the process, you
need to involve people from different parts of your business. This 
201
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Eyes on the Process: Value Stream Mapping

allows issues to receive input from different viewpoints, and it facilitates 
company-wide acceptance when the time comes to implement solutions.
2. Determine what process or value stream you want to map.
Don’t try to map every product and process flow right off the bat; that
just makes it harder for your team to get started. You want to map the
part of the process causing the greatest pain. You can, however, group
several related products or services that follow similar process flows.
(See the later section “Grouping products and services into families to
simplify mapping” for details.)
3. Create a current state map that shows the current flow of material
and information, through your chosen process or value stream,
required to make your product or provide your service.
Make sure you have the perspective of the customer when doing this
step; you’re more likely to see issues that have an impact on the cus-
tomer. (See the later section “To the Drawing Board: Creating a Current
State Map” for more details on this step.)
4. Develop a future state map that shows the improved process or value
stream created by identifying waste, resolving problems, and propos-
ing changes.
This step is where you can design ways to eliminate problems from the
process by smoothing out the flow of material and information. The
future state map allows you to predict what your lead times should be
and how much inventory or service capability you need to have on
hand. The future state also shows the reduced steps and records the dif-
ference from the current state so that management can see the value.
(See “Do It Over: Building a Future State Map” for details.)
5. Implement the proposed changes and measure the resulting 
improvement.
The gap between the current state (Step 3) and the future state (Step 4)
is your roadmap for making changes. (See the later section “Taking
action after finishing your future map” for more information.)
Value Stream Mapping shouldn’t be a one-time event. You really won’t
know your process until you’ve gone through VSM several times. Suc-
cessful organizations continually review process flows and make contin-
uous improvements in their processes — a practice that keeps their cus-
tomers continually satisfied with the end products and services.
Checking out the advantages of VSM
Value Stream Mapping is a great place to start to examine your production or
service-delivery process in a holistic manner to see if it’s in prime condition
to deliver customer satisfaction. The benefits of VSM include the following:
202
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 Allows you to visualize how all operations fit together instead of viewing
only individual processes
 Provides a common language for everyone involved in analyzing the pro-
duction process
 Shows how material and information flows are linked together
 Makes process-flow problems easy to spot, which allows you to discuss
alternatives
 Helps you avoid optimizing one part of your process at the expense of
the entire process
 Documents where you want your organization to be and provides a
roadmap for getting there
 Proves more useful than quantitative tools for identifying steps that
don’t add value in the process (we discuss non-value-adding steps later
in this chapter)
 Helps you identify wasteful points in the process and the sources of the
waste during each of the following phases:
• Designing the product or service, from the initial concept to cus-
tomer approval
• Building the product or service, from customer order to delivery
• Servicing the product or providing additional services during cus-
tomer use
To the Drawing Board: Creating 
a Current State Map
Before you can make improvements in the process of delivering your product
or service, you have to thoroughly understand your current process. A cur-
rent state Value Stream Map gives you a starting point for looking for
improvements. In the following sections, we describe the icons that go into
maps, show you how to build a current map, and explain the convenience of
mapping product families.
Although a Value Stream Map is more than a simple flowchart (see the sec-
tion “Examining important VSM attributes”), anyone with basic flowcharting
skills can create it. You can buy software to help create the map, but most
users are better off just drawing the map by hand. If you’re truly not confi-
dent in your drawing abilities, check out your favorite Internet search engine
to find available software.
203
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Eyes on the Process: Value Stream Mapping

Eyeing icons
Like with other flowcharting processes, you use icons when creating a cur-
rent state Value Stream Map — icons that have specific meanings and stan-
dardize how you communicate with this tool. Although it’s no “official”
standard for current state VSM icons, Figure 12-1 contains the most com-
monly used icons and their meanings.
No “rule” prohibits you from making up your own icons to better describe
some unique situations in your production or service-delivery process. You
may have symbols or icons that have specific meaning to your organization
or industry that make more sense to you. Just keep them simple and make
sure that everyone agrees on a clear definition. The key is to be able to create
a map that your cross-functional team can agree on and understand.
Mapping the flow of materials 
and information
Using the VSM icons from the previous section, you can begin creating your
current state map. You start by doing an initial walkthrough of the process to
get a basic understanding of the flow of the map.
You may find it useful to go through the process backward — from the cus-
tomer to the input of raw materials or the first step in providing a service.
With this strategy, you start from your customers’ perspective and work your
way to the beginning with a more customer-centered viewpoint.
After your mapping team walks through the process, build your current state
map by using the following steps (Figure 12-2 shows the finished map):
1. Draw a basic high-level map of the flow of material or activities.
Using your VSM icons, map the major activities that occur to deliver the
product or service.
2. Collect detailed information about each step in the process and add
this to the map.
The information you take down can include things such as cycle time
(the time between when a new item is started and when the next one
begins), batch size, uptime percentage (the percentage of time that the
step is functioning — in other words, “up”), inventory levels, or scrap
rate (the amount of scrap generated over a unit of time).

3. Add both manual and electronic information flows to the map.
Use arrows to show the sequence and direction of the flow of informa-
tion. This includes things such as schedules, orders or product specifi-
cations, and so on.
4. Create a timeline at the bottom of the map.
You record the times for value-added steps at the lower part of the time-
line, and you record the times for non-value-adding steps at the upper
part. At the end of the timeline, record the lead time, which is the total
of all the time from when the order is received until the customer
receives the item (both the upper and lower parts of the timeline), and
the value-added time, which represents only those times on the lower
part of the timeline where value is being added to the product. (We
cover value-added and non-value-added steps later in this chapter.)
Check out Figure 12-2 for an example of a completed current state Value
Stream Map. The figure illustrates the overall process of creating direct-mail
pieces. You can glean the following information by looking at the figure:
 We receive shipments from our supplier twice a week.
 We store work-in-process in inventory stashes between each of our
major processes, which adds significantly to the time it takes to com-
plete an item.
 We record the cycle time (C/T), the changeover time (C/O), and the
uptime percentage for each process.
 We indicate at the bottom of the timeline the time the product sits idle in
inventory (non-value-added time) and the actual time spent working on
each item (value-added time).
Grouping products and services into 
families to simplify mapping
For many organizations that produce only a few items, selecting the processes
for which to draw current state Value Stream Maps is simple. If you have hun-
dreds of products that you produce, however, you can’t produce a map for
every single process. One way to simplify your situation is to group your
products into a small number of product families. You can then draw a map
for each product family rather than for each product.
To create your product families, follow these simple steps:
1. Create a list of the final products that you deliver to your customers.

2. For each product, list the major processes that it goes through during
production.
You begin to see that many products go through several identical steps;
this occurs most frequently in the early stages of production. Most dif-
ferences occur in steps near the end of the process.
3. Group the products that go through several identical steps into fami-
lies for VSM purposes.
You’ll most likely find that products and services that aren’t related from a
customer point of view go through several of the same steps during produc-
tion. The trick is to focus on processes that many products share. Also, don’t
get stuck trying to match up products perfectly; creating the perfect Value
Stream Map has no value to your customer. Focus on the purpose of VSM: to
help you identify waste in your processes, which in turn allows you to pro-
duce better products or deliver better services.
Do It Over: Building a Future State Map
After you map your current process flow (see the previous sections), you can
begin looking for ways to improve your process. You create a future state
Value Stream Map based on the current map to document the improvements
you make. This is where you smooth the flow of material and information to
eliminate problems. In the following sections, we explain how to analyze the
value of steps in your process and how to use that analysis to build and act
on your future map.
Evaluating value-added steps 
and non-value-added steps
The most important part of analyzing a Value Stream Map is understanding
the difference between process steps that add value to your product or ser-
vice and steps that don’t add value. Here are some definitions:
 Value-added steps add value to the product or service. Simple enough!
These steps typically transform the product or service in a way that’s
important to the customer. This may include a task such as assembly.
 Non-value-added steps don’t add something to the product or service
that the customer would pay for. This may include moving products
from one area to another or storing products in inventory.
209
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Eyes on the Process: Value Stream Mapping

As you analyze the steps you identified in your current state map, you can
begin to build your future state map. Here are some questions to answer:
 How long is your lead time?
 What percentage of your total time do you spend on value-added steps?
 How much inventory do you have on hand at any one time?
 Can you identify any communications problems?
 Can you combine any processes to eliminate inventory?
 Do you have any obvious bottlenecks?
Most organizations are surprised to find out that much of the time that goes
toward making their products is spent on non-value-added steps. Most find
that 80 percent or more of the total production lead time is non-value-added.
By doing what you can to eliminate the non-value-added steps, with the help
of your future state Value Stream Map, you can drastically reduce your lead
time and make your overall process more efficient.
Sometimes, you can’t eliminate non-value-added steps. Examples include
steps necessary to remain in legal compliance. Consider these steps the cost
of doing business. It isn’t in your company’s best interest to cut corners that
may place it in legal jeopardy. Other examples include the following:
 Gathering data for reports on the amount of air pollution emitted
 Taking actions to prevent insider trading before stock offerings or prior
to reporting quarterly earnings
 Collecting and paying taxes on materials, payroll, and so on
 Collecting asset information for claims in case of a loss
Constructing a future state map 
with your newfound knowledge
A future state map is designed to reduce or remove time, effort, and dollars
from the entire production or service-delivery process. Every situation is
unique, but most processes are guilty of having waste in areas such as prod-
uct handling, inventory sitting around between steps, communications
between internal and external processes, and changeover time for 
workstations.
210
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Take a look at Figure 12-3 to see a possible future state map for the informa-
tion we collected in the current state map in Figure 12-2. Notice the following
improvements planned through the future state map:
 We’ve improved our handling of the product to reduce the amount of
time it sits around by implementing a “supermarket” inventory system
to better control inventory (see Chapter 15 for details on implementing
a Kanban system).
 We’ve combined a couple of processes (printing and assembly) into one
work center to eliminate inventory between the two processes.
 All together, we’ve reduced the lead time for filling an order from just
over eight days to a little over four.
 We’ve noted that we think we can make further improvements by reduc-
ing the changeover time on the cutting machine.
Taking action after finishing 
your future state map
Upon completion of your organization’s future state Value Stream Map, you
should prepare an action plan to make the future map — and the improve-
ments outlined within — a reality. The gap between where you are today —
the current state map — and where you want to be — the future state map —
may seem enormous, but you may be able to break it down into a number of
small improvements that your organization can easily make.
Factors to look for when implementing your future state map include the 
following:
 Have you eliminated all bottlenecks in your process?
 Is information available when needed for each process?
 Are you keeping inventory to a minimum?
 Are you creating several small batches of products or a few large ones?
 Is the demand for your product Pulled by the customer, or do you Push
material through the system as it becomes available (see Chapter 15 for
more on Push versus Pull)?
You can’t look at each of these things alone; a reduction in inventory in one
area may create a bottleneck in another. Ask these questions over and over
as you move toward your future state.

Chapter 13
Focusing on the 5S Method
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of 5S
 Rolling out a 5S program in your workplace
 Implementing the five phases successfully
P
erhaps your company’s work areas are cluttered — not just the desktops
but under the desks, on the shelves, in the drawers. The work areas are
dusty, smelly, and, well, dirty. In some places, everything in sight is nice and
neat, but all the closets contain piles of rubbish. No one wants to work in filth
(with the exception of third graders, of course). A bright, clean work area is a
pleasant place (as for the actual work, that may be another story).
The 5S method is the Japanese concept of housekeeping. 5S is a methodical
approach to eliminating waste in time and materials. Its philosophy is that a
simplified work area operates more efficiently, cheaply, and safely. The belief
is that a sloppy workspace is, by its nature, filled with waste: wasted time look-
ing for items, wasted costs in excess materials and tools, wasted space, and so
on. The five S’s, loosely translated into English, are Sort (Seiri), Straighten
(Seiton), Shine (Seiso), Standardize (Seiketsu), and Sustain (Shitsuke). 5S’s
mantra is “only what is needed, in its proper place, clean and ready for use.”
The words all begin with an S in Japanese, but their real translations into
English begin with different letters. For example, Standardize should be
Organize. Just to remove the clutter of non-S’s, someone dug up comparable
English words that begin with an “S.”
In this chapter, we show you the pros and cons of using 5S in your workplace.
We also explain how to introduce 5S to your employees and successfully
move through the five phases.

Understanding the Pros and Cons of 5S
Using the 5S method in your company has a variety of benefits, but you also
need to be aware of some disadvantages before you decide to move forward.
We cover the pros and cons of 5S in the following sections.
The pros
Simple processes are the easiest to complete with the fewest errors. Cleaning
and organizing a work area with 5S simplifies activities because you have
fewer chances for errors. Here are a few more benefits of using 5S:
 Cost savings through
• Reduced materials inventory
• Fewer tools used more often
• Faster office processes with fewer approvals
 Improved morale through a cleaner workplace
Who enjoys working in a dump? Well, perhaps landfill managers, but at
least they work with organized filth.
 Increased safety through reduced clutter
 Swifter changes from doing one process to another
 Ease of moving workers around because each area uses similar processes
So, how can 5S improve quality for your company? Let us count the ways:
 5S simplifies processes. By examining workflows in a department,
removing the need to work around clutter, and making needed material
easy to find, you greatly simplify processes.
 5S increases materials visibility. The same material is now always located
in the same marked places. The materials stockman can see when materi-
als are running low and address the situation before you run out.
 5S reenergizes the workforce. 5S is an employee-driven program. They
organize the work areas, and they decide what stays and goes; the result
is cleaner, more efficient workspaces.
 5S improves quality of management. The work in progress is more 
visually obvious now that the clutter is gone. Incoming materials are
always in the same places, and you can tell when they’re running short.
214
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Finished goods are always in the same places, and you can tell if they’re
on schedule.
 5S improves the quality of changing over to occasional production runs.
You plan the locations of processes and materials and mark their locations
on the floor, which reduces confusion and improves product quality.
The cons
The 5S process can flop if your company lacks the courage to promptly
resolve questions. Additional disadvantages of introducing 5S to your com-
pany include the following:
 People develop a comfort level for the way things are today, whether the
methods are efficient or wasteful. Radically changing practices can be
unsettling to people who live their lives within daily routines. People
may resist giving up their secret stashes of parts and tools.
 Cleaning up a mess that took years to create takes time. Your organiza-
tion needs to clean up the entire facility.
 The results of 5S fade away without management support to maintain
the initiative.
Rolling Out 5S with Communications
Boards
5S is an easy concept to understand. Most work areas (including offices) can
benefit from a thorough cleaning and reorganization. However, 5S is more
than a one-time event. 5S is a way to approach all manner of work: everything
in its place, no clutter, and so on.
People are funny creatures. Some “forget” to clean up after themselves, and
some packrat everything away just in case. Over time, the buildup of clutter
can be overwhelming. After a taste of what 5S can do to improve their work
situations, few people want to go back to the old ways.
As with all quality programs, you must introduce 5S to employees and train
them on its steps; we provide general information about these tasks in
Chapter 5. In the following sections, we discuss a special element of rolling
out 5S to your company: the use of different communications boards.
215
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

Kick off a 5S program during the company’s slow season. Some companies
find slowing down individual departments one at a time to implement 5S too
disruptive. Instead, they make 5S a single, facility-wide event. This technique
minimizes the overall disruption to production. An alternate strategy is to
implement 5S in one or a few teams at a time. Over time, the local 5S program
learns more, and each subsequent event is smoother than the last.
Establishing a facility communications
board
Critical communications tools both for the Rollout and for the Sustain phases
(which we cover later in this chapter) are the 5S communications boards.
One board is set up for the status of each 5S team (see the next section for
details). A facility-wide 5S communications board tallies overall facility infor-
mation. The facility board contains
 A formal statement of executive support — usually the 5S announce-
ment letter
 A picture of the facility’s 5S leader, along with a statement of the pro-
gram’s goals
 A schedule showing which departments have completed 5S and when
the rest of them plan on finishing
 A department-by-department listing of floor space freed by 5S
 A listing of the materials and tools returned to the warehouse for reissue
 The dollar value of the returned materials (in LARGE type)
 Before and after pictures of some of the “worst” cases
Always communicate with the workforce. To keep 5S alive, employees must
believe that it makes their jobs easier and more pleasant. They must see how
valued their ideas are for continuously improving the work areas. In short,
involving employees in 5S decision making from the beginning provides them
with pride of ownership. Management recognition of a good job also helps.
Starting a status board 
for each department
The first thing to do after you schedule a department for 5S is to establish a
large signboard for the department. Most signs are 4’-x-6’ sheets of plywood
painted with light colors. The signboard is a central source for a department’s
5S journey.
216
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

The left side of the board features the “before” information, and the right side
features the “after”:
 On the “before” side of the board, post pictures taken from multiple angles
to show how the work area looks before cleanup. Take plenty of pictures to
include the overall layout, a typical workbench, materials storage areas,
incoming materials, and finished goods. Office pictures may show materi-
als stuffed into cabinets where the doors barely close, boxes of records
that no one ever looks at, cubicles with unused monitors and keyboards,
and overflowing trashcans and ashtrays outside the company entrance.
 The “after” side consists of pictures taken after the cleanup, an issues
log, cleaning assignments, and floor plans showing the reorganized
department (we cover all these items later in this chapter).
In the following sections, we show you two important documents to post on 
a status board before you start the 5S phases: a “before” floor plan and a
“before” spaghetti chart.
The “before” floor plan
Create a sketch of the department’s “before” floor plan as it exists today. This
image doesn’t need to be of drafting quality; it just needs to be understand-
able. Marking major work and storage areas is essential for any type of facil-
ity. The key is to identify normal processes and track their flow across whatever
floor plan you use. For example, the key elements to indicate in a factory
department are
 Workbenches
 Tool locations
 Materials storage
 Incoming materials
 Finished materials collections/departure points
 Large machines (difficult to move)
Office floor plans should indicate any common areas — such as a room full of
printers shared by all workers — document storage areas, and even restrooms.
Figure 13-1 shows a sample “before” floor plan in a manufacturing facility. In
this example, the workbenches are more or less in the upper- to middle-left of
the room. Materials are along the opposite wall, with forklifts roaring through
the gangway to make a walking worker’s trip for parts similar to crossing a
highway. Piles of incoming material are splayed out along the top wall, with
finished goods collected in the lower right of the room. Spare tools are located
near the finished goods.
217
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

When you evaluate a floor plan, approach it as something that has evolved
over time rather than a well-considered layout. Identify the primary functions
for the work area and how the work must flow from desk to desk (or station
to station). In Figure 13-1, the empty space in this area seems to have
attracted excess material from other departments. The room includes con-
struction materials (an asphalt patch), a barrel of cleaning solvent, and a
barrel for collecting paint (potentially hazardous materials).
Other departments aren’t the only ones to blame for the excess. The work-
space has three places for accumulating finished goods (which workers
should send straight to shipping), as well as shelves and cabinets of extra
tools and spare parts. Far more work-in-process material is on hand than is
necessary for the next two days.

Like many places, this work area reflects personal preferences; it doesn’t
optimize workflow.
The “before” spaghetti chart
Most people don’t realize the amount of productive time wasted walking here
and there to collect the materials, information, and tools necessary to com-
plete an assignment. A spaghetti chart, such as the one in Figure 13-2, is a
tool you can use to identify the amount of travel time in a process. Setting up
and using the chart is easy:

219
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

1. Use a sketch of the existing floor plan (see the preceding section) to
track the movement of workers.
2. Follow a worker around for about two hours (after warning the
worker that you’re going to do this).
Every time she leaves her workbench, follow her. On the chart, mark a
line that shows where she started and her destination, such as from the
workbench to the spare-parts shelves. The lines on the chart can
become hard to count, so make a notation of where the worker walked.
3. When you complete the chart for that worker, measure the distances
between all the points where she walked.
4. Calculate the distance walked during the two-hour period, and multi-
ply that figure by four to estimate the distance walked per shift.
Repeat the spaghetti chart process for each worker. Individuals usually have dif-
ferent duties with different walking paths. Tally the walk distance for the entire
team. When you convert to miles per week, the number is always impressive!
The Sort Phase: Separating the 
Gravel from the Gems
Many managers have a justified packrat mentality. Obtaining funding for addi-
tional tools, materials, and so on can be difficult. As a hedge against a future
requirement, a manager may have stuffed away
 Anything left over from previous assignments
 Scrapped items with “still useful” parts attached
 Anything scrounged from other departments
 Goods returned by customers
Occasionally, jobs are halted in mid-stride for potential completion at a future
date. Instead of returning material to the warehouse, people let it linger in the
departments in case the order comes to finish the job. Unfortunately, all this
hoarding ties up a considerable amount of company funds in material that
sits idle for a very long time.
The Sort phase of 5S clears out all the clutter. The goal is to identify the mate-
rials needed to perform work over the next two days and keep it on hand.
Everything else has to go. The local supervisor can share the production
schedule for the next week with the team so workers know what the upcom-
ing requirements may be.
220
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

In the following sections, we explain how to prepare for the Sort phase and
how to separate the good stuff from the unnecessary.
Preparing to sort
Careful planning is the key to success! Follow these steps to make your sort
easier:
1. Sketch a floor plan of where everything is now.
This plan indicates the original location for everything (see “The ‘before’
floor plan” earlier in this chapter for more details). Everything must
have been in its place for a reason, so when changing things around,
think about how each item was used in various processes.
2. Identify a nearby area where you can store occasionally used material.
Often, a work area supports low-volume or rarely scheduled processes.
The department should store the material and special tooling for those
processes somewhere nearby, but out of the way of day-to-day efforts.
The key is to make all occasionally used materials as portable as possi-
ble. Place large containers of material on wheeled platforms, create
carts of tools and small hardware, and so on. Roll these tools and mate-
rials in and out as needed.
3. Obtain green and red tags — twice as many as you think you’ll need.
A green tag means you want to keep that item where it is; a red tag indi-
cates that you want to move that item out to the disposal site.
4. Decide where to send material for disposal.
Often, this location is a warehouse where your workers can drop off
materials. Another popular material drop-off point is the loading dock
next to the dumpster. At this point, someone examines everything and
determines where it should go.
When you dispose of office documents, it may be faster and safer to
shred them rather than separate private information from public.
5. Decide how to handle items identified for disposal.
Typically, a materials-management clerk and someone from the account-
ing department jointly decide what to do with each item. Your disposal
options include the following:
• Return to vendor: Where possible, recapture value by returning
the material to the vendor for a credit. Track the amount of money
received from returned or scrapped materials. You may save by
collecting excess tools for redistribution.
221
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

• Return to warehouse: To avoid shuffling piles of materials around
the facility, return all unneeded material to the warehouse. (Office
employees may return material to the stationary office where they
go for office supplies.) Don’t allow other departments to scavenge
from the pile. If they need something, they must request it through
the normal channels.
• Throw away or sell: Dispose of an item in the trash (have plenty of
trash containers on hand), sell it for its value, or sell it for scrap
(such as metal parts).
• Donate: Give items to charity.
• Send to the landfill: After checking with the local environmental
experts, send materials directly to the landfill. Note: Always dis-
pose of hazardous materials properly.
Sorting everything with ease
Sorting eliminates much of the clutter in a work area. This step improves
safety by removing the amount of junk workers can fall over. It also simplifies
the cleaning process. Everyone can see where everything is.
Follow these steps to sort all materials with ease:
1. Tag all materials to stay (a green tag) or to go (a red tag; see the list in
the previous section). Anything overlooked is missing a tag. (Please don’t
put a red tag on a lazy manager or a sleeping worker!) Don’t tag small
items individually; instead, let one tag mark everything within a container.
2. Open, inspect, and tag every drawer, cabinet, shelf, toolbox, and con-
tainer in the work area. Seek out broken or obsolete material and dispose
of it. Often, a quick payback for this step is the uncovering of material,
tools, and so on that someone stashed away for years just in case of need.
3. When the 5S team members think the job is done, they should verify
that they’ve tagged everything. They can start in one corner of the
room and methodically work their way across to ensure that they
haven’t overlooked anything. You also can ensure that everything is
tagged when sifting the good from the departing items.
Open areas attract other departments’ clutter. Reconfigure the work area to
return that unused space to the facility. Don’t let any other department
shovel its clutter into the newly freed space.
Recognize that for some people, red-tagging their favorite tools, machinery,
or secret stashes of parts is an emotional moment. They may grasp at
excuses to keep certain items without valid business reasons. They also may
hide their clutter in nearby departments to avoid the cleaning. A supervisor
must seek out and send this material for disposal.
222
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

The Straighten Phase: A Place for
Everything and Everything in Its Place
After you finish sorting, the time comes to Straighten. Straightening means
deciding where to place tools and materials based on the workers’ locations.
Everything workers need should be within easy reach. Organize the work
area so that all materials are easy to find. Assign a dedicated space for each
item so only one item goes in that spot. Place tools and materials to minimize
worker travel time, not for appearance or optimal storage. We show you how
to do all this and more in the following sections.
Companies occasionally execute the Straighten and Shine phases together,
because Shine requires moving items to clean up, and Straighten places them
in the proper spot; see “The Shine Phase: Polishing It All Up!” later in this
chapter for more details.
Tidying tools and materials
A tool can be anything someone uses over and over to hold or shape some-
thing; tools include items from a bar-code scanner, to a particular printer, to a
special medical machine. Office tools include expensive (nonstandard) tele-
phones, old computer keyboards and monitors scattered about and in clos-
ets, excess fax machines, time clocks, and copiers. Workers use some tools
only in certain situations, but this equipment saves a lot of time. One thing
most tools have in common is that they’re expensive and need to be managed.
Materials are the work products — the things being shaped or assembled. For
example, a material may be a customer purchase request, where one depart-
ment checks the customer’s credit, another fills the order, and then a third
ships it, each adding to the document as it passes through the process.
In any given workplace, people need to straighten both tools and materials.
How? Just follow these tips:
 Store shared tools on shadow boards. Tools like wrenches and ham-
mers are inexpensive, so everyone may have one. However, not every-
one needs a personal copy of the more expensive and less-used tools.
Place shared tools on shadow boards (boards that label tool locations
with pictures of the tools’ outlines). A shadow board ensures that spe-
cial tools are always in the same place when needed. At the end of the
shift, the entire board needs only a glance. If something is missing, the
team can see that it’s gone. (In an office, shared areas from the coffee
room to the printer room should have a proper place for everything
identified.)
223
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

 Combine toolboxes. Many departments are plagued with an overgrowth
of toolboxes. Each box takes up valuable floor or counter space. If the
operation covers two shifts, the space requirement doubles. A common
solution is to move to company-owned, shared toolboxes. Organize the
shared toolboxes with every tool in its assigned place. Mark tool draw-
ers with what they contain.
 Paint marks on floors to indicate drop points and storage areas for
large items. Big factory items should have a designated floor space.
Mark the spot by painting a box around it. Also, do this step for drop
points for large containers of incoming material and outgoing finished
goods.
An office can clearly mark all file cabinets by using a standard identifica-
tion system. Employees also can hang signs from the ceiling to identify
each department or work team.
 Use shelving to take advantage of vertical space. Cabinets often hide
items, so you can use shelving instead or remove the doors on the cabi-
nets. The goal is to be able to easily locate items with minimal searching.
If theft is an issue, you can use doors of wire mesh.
 Store items based on their frequency of use. Store commonly used
items at eye level. Place lightly used items high and low.
 Manage the flow of materials. Drop large containers of incoming materi-
als in their designated floor areas. Replenish smaller materials by using
the Kanban method we describe in Chapter 15. Flow racks, where work-
ers load the material containers from the rear, can keep components in a
first-in, first-out sequence.
Identify the amount of each type of material that the department should
keep on hand and the best way to maintain that level. Keep only the quanti-
ties of material needed for the next 48 hours, and store excess in the ware-
house or other storage area. To maintain tidiness, the materials team may
have to make more frequent deliveries of smaller quantities of material.
Putting away personal items
Don’t permit personal items, such as coats and lunchboxes, to litter the work
area. Place them in a dedicated area, such as an employee locker room or a
department coat rack. When selecting a storage area, keep in mind that per-
sonal items may include muddy boots and wet raincoats. The goal is to mini-
mize messes.
Of course, workers can still hang up personal pictures, comical calendars, and
so on. (These items help to soften the sharp edges of an office.) We simply
advise that you keep bulky and potentially wet items like coats, umbrellas,
224
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

and boots away from work areas. Large lunchboxes need to fit under the
desks. Also, large plants may be pretty, but they use up scarce workspace;
limit them to cabinet tops.
Labeling items
Label all shelves, containers, cabinets, drawers, and so on with their con-
tents. This way, everyone knows what to store in each place, and by implica-
tion, everything else needs to go elsewhere. Because everyone knows or can
find out the proper place for items, this step eliminates having duplicate
stacks of materials around the work area.
Create standardized labels for use across the facility. At a minimum, the label
should provide the part number and the name of the item. An even better
solution is to include a picture of the item on the label. With inexpensive
inkjet printers and digital cameras, you can easily add images. See “The
Standardize Phase: Using the Best Practices Everywhere,” later in this chap-
ter, for more about standardization in your workplace.
Another variation of labeling is to color-code parts and tools that support a
specific process. For example, all the parts and special tools identified with
green labels can support Process #1, and yellow labels can indicate Process
#2. Common parts and tools may have plain white labels.
Drawing up “after” floor plans and charts
After you organize and label your tools and materials, draw a floor plan for
how you want to organize the entire work area. The drawing is essential so
that the maintenance team can plan the movement of electrical, data, and
telephone services to the relocated workbenches in factories, cubicles in
offices, and the like. The 5S team should do as much as it can on its own, but
be aware of safety issues for tasks such as moving heavy objects. The team
may need outside help.
Here are a few major considerations for when you draw up a new floor plan,
no matter what type of workplace you have:
 When setting up workbenches, keep parts in the sequence in which
workers use them. If five parts fit together into something, place them in
a rack from left to right or top to bottom.
 Set up the workbenches and desks so that work flows across them —
incoming work on one side (like a big in box) and finished products on
the other side (the famous desktop out box).
225
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

 Position materials and tools to minimize the time workers spend walking
around.
 Place desks close together for workers who constantly share informa-
tion; for instance, put a manager who must approve special deals in a
sales-call center.
Look at the example “after” floor plan in Figure 13-3. The two extra work-
benches are off to disposal, and only the four active stations remain. To the
right of each workbench is a location for a container of incoming material.
The product being assembled moves from the incoming material on the right
toward the left, across the workbench to a gravity-fed conveyor along the left
wall. Finished material rolls down to the last workbench, where the worker
has the additional duty of loading finished goods into a single container.

To slow down the forklift jockeys, the maintenance team has installed three
speed bumps on the floor. This change keeps the gangway accessible but dis-
courages lift drivers from cutting through the department.
Excess parts are off to the warehouse, and excess cabinets are in the disposal
pile. In their place are two sets of flow racks. The racks face the gangway to
save walk time. With the speed bumps in place, parts pickers no longer fear
becoming smears on a forklift’s windshield.
Using the process we describe in “The ‘before’ spaghetti chart” earlier in this
chapter, draw a spaghetti chart for the remodeled work area, as shown in
Figure 13-4. Measure the worker walk distance required to complete the same
work. Be sure to add this savings of walk time to the 5S status board! (See
“Starting a status board for each department” earlier in this chapter for more
information.)

Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

The Shine Phase: Polishing It All Up!
The third S is to Shine! The 5S team cleans work areas and keeps them that
way. Sad to say, in many companies, the first business function considered
unnecessary is the cleaning staff. Although cutting the cleaning staff saves
money in the short run, it costs more over the long term. Excess dirt wears
down carpet and tile faster, trash slowly builds, and so on. A clean working
area creates a positive and uplifting environment, just as a dirty, cluttered
one is rather depressing.
A factory can’t afford to be as clean as a hospital’s operating room. However,
a factory floor can be as clean as an office floor, and most offices can be even
cleaner. How clean is clean enough? When in doubt, view the facility through
the eyes of a customer. Would your housekeeping inspire confidence that
orders will be on time, or does the place look chaotic?
Working conditions also have an impact on workers’ attitudes. A clean work-
station provides a mentally positive situation for improved productivity.
Without a thorough cleaning, all the sorting and straightening up to this point
can soon revert to the old dirty ways.
Therefore, cleaning is a logical extension of the Straightening phase (see the
previous section). Cleaning has to cover areas from the top to the bottom
(ceiling to floor). Leave no area untouched, including hard-to-see places. In
the following sections, we discuss gathering needed equipment, handling
common areas, cleaning up messes immediately, and paying close attention
to maintenance.
Gathering the necessary equipment
Cleaning is a production process just like any other. It keeps the workspace
ready to use. This stage includes the cleaning of workbenches, the floor, stor-
age areas, and tools. Cleaning requires proper tools, supplies, and, in some
cases, written processes. Begin by making a list of what to clean, along with
the tools and materials needed to do so:
 Tools: Think about all the things that you need cleaned, and ensure that
adequate tools are available to complete the tasks in the time allotted.
Beyond a few brooms and mops (or vacuum cleaners for an office), your
organization needs equipment to reach high to clean dusty places.
Sometimes, this gear includes stepladders, dust brushes on long poles,
and so on. Look for equipment in the work area that may need special
items, such as lint-free cloths to clean computer displays or alcohol to
clean moisture-intolerant electronics.
228
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 Materials: Consider the cleaning materials that go along with the clean-
ing tools, like soap and dusting spray. Your organization must store and
replenish cleaning materials in line with the 5S standards like any other
production item.
 Processes: Although some of the workers’ spouses may disagree,
instructions for sweeping and mopping the floor are likely unnecessary.
However, make sure you clearly document the cleaning of any special
items or electronic equipment in the work area to prevent damage from
improper cleaning.
Even companies that use off-hours cleaning workers for most housekeeping
duties provide cleaning materials for use during the day. This step places the
responsibility for maintaining a clean work area squarely on the team.
Recognizing that common 
areas belong to everyone
In addition to cleaning their individual work areas, employees should band
together to take care of common areas. Common areas include passageways,
locker rooms, break and kitchen areas, and restrooms. 5S says that even if
someone else cleans these areas, workers still need to clean up after them-
selves. Every inch of the facility must be covered and cleaned.
The 5S leader should assign someone to address areas outside the building.
After 5S on the inside is complete, someone has to sort through the scrap and
other clutter that has accumulated on the outside. Eliminating this material
shines the outside of the facility and improves a customer’s first impression.
Cleaning as you go
A basic rule of the Shine phase is that all team members clean as they go,
now and forever. Workers immediately contain and clean up spills. People
gather and take away unneeded packing material. They promptly empty over-
flowing trash bins.
Peer pressure quickly steps in. Some people are accustomed to leaving their
messes for others to deal with. Not anymore! Instead of their mothers telling
them to pick up after themselves, their co-workers tell them — likely with
more emphasis.
Another component of the Shine phase is to post cleaning assignments for all
team members on the team’s 5S board (see “Starting a status board for each
229
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

department,” earlier in this chapter, for details). This posting sets expecta-
tions concerning who needs to do what and lets everyone know about the
responsibilities of the workers. (Step back and watch the peer pressure on
the slackers!) Spread the responsibility to clean specific parts of the work
area among the team. If an area’s housekeeping is below standard, you can
see who isn’t performing his or her job.
Addressing maintenance issues and 
fixing problems at the source
Shine means more than cleaning; it also means identifying the root causes of
messes and eliminating them. In an office, this step may mean installing (or at
least changing) the dust filters in the air-handling equipment. In a factory,
preventing messes may mean putting splash shields around cutting tools,
placing drums of liquids on spill-containment pallets (which absorb leaks), or
installing vacuum dust collectors around processes that create dust.
Cleaning up a work area often highlights maintenance issues within the facil-
ity. Maintenance issues have a major impact on how clean a work area can
become. In addition to those we previously mentioned, common issues
include the following:
 Leaky pipes, leaky windows, broken shelves, and the like
 Poor lighting
 A short supply of electrical outlets and/or unlabeled switches
Make sure that someone documents all these maintenance problems on the
issues log on the “after” side of the team status board. This list holds all the
open requests to other departments, pending decisions from executives, and
known problems. The team’s supervisor updates each item at least weekly.
Post the list prominently on the board so everyone can see the open issues
and the progress made toward resolving them.
Turn over all facilities issues to the maintenance department for prompt action.
Management needs to ensure that all issues are resolved; in the empowered
workplace, any issues that the team can safely resolve are its responsibility.
Shine phase housekeeping isn’t a substitute for prompt maintenance. Instead
of tending to an ongoing leak, you should promptly repair the leak. Quickly
driving to the root cause of an issue is important. The goal is to spend little
time addressing the problem rather than a lot of unproductive time treating
the symptom.
230
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

The Standardize Phase: Using the 
Best Practices Everywhere
The Standardize phase gathers the results of the first three phases and
spreads the best practices across the facility. Even though various teams
have determined the best places to store tools and materials, the goal is to
standardize practices across the facility.
Standardized processes are important aspects of the 5S concept. The work-
place allows room for individuality. However, personal styles add complexity
when applied to tools or processes shared with others. Standard processes
shorten the time required to cross-train workers, bring in substitutes, or
expand the work teams. After the best practices become standards, everyone
knows the best ways to address certain situations. A visitor should be able to
understand where item is within 60 seconds.
Find the right balance between standardization and unique workstation
requirements. Simple processes are the easiest for people to accept. To stan-
dardize practices in any type of facility, try the following:
 Define facility-wide cleanliness standards. Organizations often docu-
ment standards with a picture book showing clean areas with notations
of the areas to remember to hit.
 Gather the best practices from each 5S team, and appoint representa-
tives from the various teams to select practices for use across the facil-
ity. Take plenty of pictures and post them on or next to the facility’s 5S
communications board (which we cover earlier in this chapter).
 Standardize 5S status board formats. No matter which department is
visited, the same information should always be in the same place on the
board.
 Standardize labels and signage. Visual controls remind employees of
the proper places to store items, as well as where to find things.
Wherever people need reminding for safety or process reasons, include
a visual control.
Visual controls take advantage of shape, color, brightness, and location.
Color should be high contrast. Most workers are already comfortable
with the traffic-light approach of red for danger and green for okay. When
making signs, pick colors that make the messages jump out from the
background colors instead of blending into them.
 Include a standard to label every work cell and every person’s work-
station. Functions and departments sometimes move around, so labeling
231
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

the work cells makes finding things easier. Placing workers’ names on
workstations builds personal pride in the 5S condition of the workstations.
 Schedule a facility-wide time for daily cleaning and for weekly 5S
team meetings. Cleaning usually occurs at the end of the workday. The
meetings take place just after lunchtime before work restarts.
 Standardize the process for auditing the 5S status of work areas (see
“Auditing the ongoing results,” later in this chapter, for details). An
audit is a check sheet you can use to verify that all the work areas and
assigned common areas are properly cleaned and organized. Over time,
this sheet should indicate a team’s ever-higher quality of 5S performance.
A final note about standards: Over time, workers may suggest exceptions to
published standards. If these exceptions become part of the unofficial way of
doing business, you may need to update the old guidelines. A standard that
you don’t enforce is merely a piece of advice, so to keep processes universal,
you have to take note of when the published standards are no longer suitable.
The Sustain Phase: Upholding the Gains
The ultimate goal of the Sustain phase is to ingrain 5S in the work habits of all
employees so that they follow the habits without reminders from others. The
Sustain phase merges the 5S program into the basic company processes. Many
companies find this to be the most difficult challenge, because old habits slowly
begin to reemerge. The Sustain phase requires that the company recognize the
5S areas as the official standards that all employees will follow.
In the following sections, we explain the importance of clarifying that 5S is here
to stay in your workplace and keeping up with responsibilities. We also show
you how to perform a daily checkup and audit 5S results on an ongoing basis.
Stressing that 5S is permanent
Up to this point, employees who have been watching all the 5S bustle from
the sidelines have either bought into the idea or figured that this program is
just another of management’s flavor-of-the-day initiatives. These workers just
smile and stay out of the way, waiting for the fad to blow over and for every-
thing to be as it was before.
During the Sustain phase, the 5S leader has to shatter employee dreams of
ever turning back the clock. The leader attempts to ingrain 5S principles into
the company’s work ethic for now and evermore. How does the leader do
that? Try the following:
232
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 Integrate 5S results into managers’ performance evaluations. Recognition
of a well-maintained work area never ends. 5S needs to become the stan-
dard for doing business rather than a temporary success.
 Turn the department 5S status board into the 5S Sustain board. The
before and after images are still useful, but the board needs updates.
The issues log never goes away, because the team is constantly looking
for ways to improve. During walkthroughs, management should focus on
the department 5S Sustain board. Doing so demonstrates that manage-
ment reads the board and that it must remain current.
 Schedule peer inspections, in which one team inspects another team’s
5S status. This evaluation keeps 5S awareness high and helps teams
share their best practices.
Continuous improvement is an idea in which no matter what people do on a
job, they’re always looking for ways to do things better, faster, and cheaper.
5S is no exception. Each work team should identify actions for improving
what they do, the way they do it, and when they do it.
Keeping up with responsibilities
During the Sustain phase, the team members have to maintain the current
gains and constantly improve them. Here are some guidelines:
 Ensure that every person stays responsible for sorting and cleaning as
they work rather than leaving it for later.
 Schedule periodic cleaning — list the activities on the department’s
status board, including who and when.
 Review best practices that other teams identify for potential inclusion in
another team’s program.
 Discuss upcoming workflow changes and design the best ways to
address them.
 Discuss issues and identify their root causes.
 Meet for 15 minutes weekly to discuss 5S issues.
Treat housekeeping and process layout as ongoing process improvements
and include them in new process designs.
Doing a daily checkup
Create a 5S daily inspection sheet with an attached pen. Hang it next to the
department 5S Sustain communications board. Every day, the supervisor
233
Chapter 13: Focusing on the 5S Method

conducts a one-minute inspection of the area to ensure it meets all standards.
If the inspection takes longer than one minute, better visual controls (see
“The Standardize Phase: Using the Best Practices Everywhere” earlier in this
chapter) may be necessary. Note any issues uncovered on the issues log sheet.
Supervisors need the self-discipline to do the checkups properly every day.
They’re responsible for driving issues to completion. The facility’s 5S leader
has to inspect the issues sheet weekly.
Auditing the ongoing results
As team members become proficient with 5S over time, they may become
complacent and start the slow slide back to the way things were before. A
valuable tool for continued enforcement of 5S practices is the work area audit.
Every week, workers from other parts of the facility select approximately 10
percent of work areas for an audit. This maintains peer pressure toward com-
pliance and maintains pride of ownership of the program. The in-house 5S
leader chooses workers for the audit team.
During the audit, the team spot-checks various parts of the work area for
adherence to the current published standards. Team members also talk to
others about their ideas for improving the 5S program.
Executives need to understand the 5S process well enough to notice some-
thing out of place when they visit a workstation. Whenever they visit a work-
station, they can make snap audits of the work area to verify that it meets
standards. These snap reviews are important because they reinforce ongoing
management support for the program.

Make Changes with 
Rapid Improvement

 Choosing a process that’s begging for improvement
 Building the best RIE team possible
 Making note of the current process for comparison purposes
 Performing a Rapid Improvement Event in five days
T
he work of a company all begins with a process — a series of steps per-
formed by workers to create or add to a product or service. Workers may
join to assemble a car door, create a payroll check, or prepare a patient for an
examination. Any action or series of actions that a company performs repeat-
edly is a process. And like anything involving people, some processes work
and some don’t. Your job, as a quality control team, is to monitor the
processes that work and improve the ones that don’t.
A Rapid Improvement Event (RIE) is a short, intense effort carried out by a
team of workers to improve a failing process; an event is typically three to
five days long. The workers who support the process should design the
improvements and set them in place. These workers should be trained to pull
apart the process and rebuild it to run more efficiently.
In this chapter, we explain the advantages and disadvantages of RIEs. We
explain how you can staff a team, choose the proper process to improve, and
document your current process. Don’t worry, we also get into the good stuff:
how to complete an RIE in five days.
Companies measure RIE improvements in thousands of dollars per year, not
millions. Still, it isn’t often that the workers of a company can honestly say
that they’ve personally improved their company’s financial situation. Simpler,

more efficient processes provide higher quality through fewer chances for
error. Some benefits, such as improved quality, won’t be immediately appar-
ent, but they do shine through eventually.
Another name for a Rapid Improvement Event is a Kaizen event. Kaizen is a
Japanese word meaning “continuous improvement.” Many managers in the
United States can’t force themselves to wait for the end benefits brought on
by many small changes, so they use a Kaizen “blitz” as a short, intensive
effort to force Lean principles into an existing process. (See Chapter 11 for a
quick introduction to Lean.)
Considering the Pros and Cons 
of Rapid Improvement Events
All business processes start out operating perfectly (that’s the plan, anyway).
Over time, however, things change. Gradually, a simple process becomes
more complex, and this complexity can breed inefficiency. Rapid
Improvement Events aim to identify and remove the “extra” from processes
and return them to efficiency. The events
 Train workers how to use tools and techniques to identify waste in a
process and eliminate it.
 Set new expectations for process performance.
 Educate the workforce to “think Lean.” Over time, employees become intol-
erant of poor quality, poor communication, and poor process performance.
Rapid Improvement Events can provide immediate benefits to a company, but
an organization also has to keep an eye on the potential disadvantages, too.
In the following sections, we cover both the pros and cons of using RIEs.
The pluses of RIEs
You can point to several obvious advantages of Rapid Improvement Events
when considering them for your quality process. With careful planning, all
these benefits can be yours!
 Cost savings: Your company will save money through
• Faster, streamlined process performance
• Reduced labor costs
236
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

• Improved quality through fewer errors
• Less cash tied up in partially finished goods
 Energized workforce: Workers organize the work area, analyze the
process, identify waste, and eliminate it. Employees’ ideas solve the
problem, so they “own” the solution.
 Immediate payback for improvements: This payback is often the result
of streamlining labor and returning excess material for use elsewhere.
 Relatively inexpensive to conduct: An RIE has minimal paperwork and
overhead.
The minuses of RIEs
Before your organization embarks on a program of Rapid Improvement
Events, you need to consider these possible problem areas:
 Improvements are isolated to one area. To gain full benefit from Rapid
Improvement Events, an organization must undertake a company-wide
conversion to Lean processes.
 The process you seek to improve must be out of service for about a
week. Consider working ahead to stockpile material to use during the
event.
 RIEs may raise unmanageable worker expectations. Carefully set team
member expectations so they’ll know what to expect, and count on them
to spread those expectations to others in the organization. Process
changes focus on what’s possible within the event’s duration.
 RIEs make a process run faster and more error-free; however, if the
process was making poorly designed parts to start with, it will now
make them faster. RIEs are based on the premise that the product or
service created is the optimal product desired by the customer. If the
process output specifications are for poorly designed parts or services,
then the team will create the poor design faster and more efficiently.
However, it won’t improve customer satisfaction.
Seek and Improve: Selecting 
a Process Victim
Careful selection of a process to undergo a Rapid Improvement Event is
important. Everyone will closely watch the first RIE. The person sponsoring
237
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

the RIE at your company must look for the worst-case process — a place
where savings are easiest to see — and to concentrate on the most trouble-
some aspects of the process. (See Chapter 5 for more about quality spon-
sors.) Choose a process and steps of the process where employees will be
able to see the difference after the RIE. It helps if the process’s workers are in
favor of participating. In the following sections, we explain how to select a
process victim and target certain steps of that process for improvement.
Identifying a problematic process
When selecting a problematic process within your company, look first to the
following:
 A bottleneck process that delays other work
 A process that creates poor results, causing scrap or rework
 A critical process that’s in disarray
After looking at the major factors in the previous list, you can intensify your
search to select a process that you could easily measure in terms of its bene-
fits. Signs of a good target for improvement may include the following:
 A process that’s too expensive or takes too much time
 A process that workers complain is awkward
 Work is late, which requires express (read: expensive) shipments to 
customers
 A high scrap rate, which requires express shipments of incoming 
material
 Areas cluttered with material to rework
 Regularly expedited orders with “hot order” tags
 Production of items that don’t meet customer expectations (see Chapter 6)
For the first RIE, “pick the low hanging fruit.” In other words, select the one
place that is visible to everyone and provides the greatest financial payback.
Both of these factors are important for breaking down internal barriers
against future RIEs.
Concentrating on tasks within the process
In a big-picture sense, a production process extends from the point that a
customer order enters the building to when the final product leaves. The
238
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

entire process is too much for an RIE to tackle at once. Instead, your quality
team should focus on the worst-performing steps in the process.
Here are methods you can use to spot the process steps to pick on:
 Examine existing quality inspection data to determine the point in the
process where defects begin to show up. Backtrack through the process
from there to determine the guilty process step. (See Chapters 7, 8, and
9 for details on data.)
 Ask the workers on the line. They are a wealth of information about the
process they work with every day.
 Walk through the process step by step and note the points of greatest
chaos.
Finding a Few Good Workers: Staffing 
an Improvement Team
A Rapid Improvement Event team is much like any sports team or even any
military outfit: It requires excited workers, an experienced leader, and sup-
port from management. This is a truth you must handle to enjoy RIE success!
A typical RIE team is made up of six to eight people. More than this, and
chaos reigns! Half of the people should come from the process step being
attacked. Add one representative from the preceding step in the process and
one from the next step in the process to ensure that the process results pass
smoothly. As the RIE progresses, “part-time” team members may be called on
to advise the team through some part of the effort, such as engineering, facili-
ties management, human resources, and so on.
In the following sections, we discuss the important folks who should be part
of any RIE team.
Workers are the heart of the team
The core of your RIE team needs to consist of the workers who normally per-
form the steps of the process under examination, along with some of the
people who support them. No one knows a task like the people who do it day
in and day out, often for years at a time. They know what should be done in a
particular situation and why, and they know what has worked in the past and
what hasn’t.
239
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

Most process steps have four or fewer workers. If there are more workers
than that, then the supervisor of that step should select four workers to
assist with the RIE and reassign the remainder to other tasks for that week.
Don’t pick the passive ones! Select the most knowledgeable worker, the best
worker, the biggest complainer — those folks who dive into the task and
don’t sit back, hoping that someone else will tell them what to do.
If the process step runs on other shifts, try to include all shifts equally. The
team may be a bit larger than optimal, but the different insights will be valuable.
The workers you choose must be free to work on the RIE. Therefore, you
need to “turn off” their work area during the RIE. Schedule the event for a
time when work is slow so everyone can pay attention to the improvement
program. This also allows your team the freedom to move things around
without disrupting work.
Include representatives from your company’s maintenance and IT staffs. When
the RIE team is ready to test the improved process layout, the members from
the maintenance crew can rearrange the target work area — often after hours.
This task takes more than scooting around a few desks; the crewmembers
must move telephone and data communication wires, provide additional
electrical service, and so on.
An experienced leader is essential
Having an experienced event leader as part of the RIE team saves time and
provides many other tangible and intangible benefits, including the following:
 An RIE leader knows how to tune the RIE method to meet a company’s
unique challenges.
 The leader’s expertise is valuable when selecting the first target 
operations.
 A leader can interview the team supporting the process to be sure that
they agree with what the team will be trying to accomplish.
 RIE leaders present classes and moderate team discussions as they
rebuild the problematic processes.
 During the event, the leader can meet daily with workers involved with
the process who aren’t on the team to explain the day’s results and ask
for advice. The goal is to maintain support by keeping them informed.
Most companies use experienced leaders from the outside as “honest bro-
kers” who don’t have ties to internal politics. Look for a consultant with
“Kaizen event” or “Kaizen blitz” experience. See Chapter 5 for details on seek-
ing outside experts.
240
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Managers also have a role to play
Process managers have a role to play during a Rapid Improvement Event.
They must
 Implement changes recommended by the team.
 Break down internal barriers to freethinking and change. Some sugges-
tions for improvement may not be practical, but the most common
answer should be, “YES!”
 Ensure that the improvements made are permanent after the RIE work
fades into distant memory.
Before the Fun Really Starts:
Documenting the Current Process
Before the Rapid Improvement Event begins, the RIE leader gathers informa-
tion on the existing process you choose for improvement (see the earlier sec-
tion “Seek and Improve: Selecting a Process Victim”). The information should
provide a performance snapshot that the team can use before it swings into
action. The info needs to include important measurements of the following:
 How quickly an item passes through the process
 Any partially finished items sitting between process stages
 The distance workers travel to complete the process
In the following sections, we cover these issues and other notes you should
make as you document the current flow of a problematic process.
Drawing a map of the process flow
The RIE leader and the supervisor of the process under scrutiny start prepar-
ing for the RIE by drawing a Value Stream Map to illustrate the flow of prod-
ucts through the process. (We cover Value Stream Mapping in detail in
Chapter 12.) Each box on the map should represent a workstation that adds
value to the product. With the map in hand, the leader and the supervisor
can perform the following functions:
 Visit the departments that feed material into the target process and
that accept its output. Note what the departments do with the materials.
The RIE’s process improvements mustn’t disrupt these processes. After
241
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

all, the goal is to make the entire process work better, not to improve
one part that disrupts everything else.
 Note any piles of material in the target process area:
• Do you see material stacked and awaiting entry into the process?
• Do you see material piled between the workstations?
• Do you see any containers of scrap material?
• Do you see heaps of materials in the area that aren’t a part of 
this process?
• Are there a large number of customer calls sitting in queues?
• Are there stacks of service requests waiting to be processed?
 Collect some “before” data to compare with the “after” data of the
improved process:
• Count the piles of material to determine the cost of semifinished
goods sitting and waiting.
• Make copies of the process’s quality inspection sheets. What sort
of issues do the sheets indicate? Ask the production manager
about problems in the target area.
On the Value Stream Map, note measurements that illustrate the problem. For
instance, if time is the problem in a step, you should note process time and
cycle time above each step. If cost is the problem, then you should note the
cost for each process task. If defects are the problem, you should count and
note them above each step. These notes may make obvious the area for
greatest improvement.
Discovering what the 
work instructions say
An RIE leader can find interesting information when comparing a target
process’s design with the way it actually runs. Work instructions describe
what workers should be doing at each step of the process. Instructions list
the tools and materials required and describe the proper way to complete
each task and what to do in special situations.
Make sure the leader compares the process’s work instructions to the Value
Stream Map to see how they match up. On occasion, workers not following
the correct procedure (and the supervisor permitting this) cause the process
problem.
242
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

In most cases, though, the instructions are simply out of date. Approved
changes occur frequently as the mix of work changes. Unapproved changes,
however, may be made for a particular worker’s convenience to the detri-
ment of the process.
Following a worker through the process
If a worker spends a considerable amount of time at a worktable, create a
spaghetti chart to track the worker’s motions at that desk. (In fact, you can
create a spaghetti chart showing the position of all the workstations and nec-
essary tools and materials; see Chapter 13 for details on spaghetti charts.)
Be sure to note any wasteful steps taken to ensure success in the process,
including some of the following, when observing the worker through the
process:
 Where does the worker reach for something?
 How many parts does the worker take?
 Where are the tools and fixtures located?
 Are the worker’s movements contorted?
 Must the worker wrestle air hoses to position tools properly?
 Are machines shared?
 Do the machine tools function properly?
 Are torque wrenches used?
The answers to these questions may point to steps that should be candidates
for improvement.
Baselining the process performance
A baseline describes the “before” of a before and after comparison of a Rapid
Improvement Event.
Before attacking the process, measure its current performance with an RIE
scorecard. This measurement is often in terms of time, the number of units
produced, and the defect rate of the finished product. Your RIE team uses
these three elements to calculate the cost of the process.
243
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

One major cost in any process is labor. An RIE calculates labor as the number
of minutes required to complete a task within a process or to complete the
entire process. The event uses this measurement as a gauge of process
improvement, because the removal of waste and an improved workstation
layout should save worker time, which reduces the amount of labor (and
cost) required to build the part.
Observe the target process in action before the RIE and record these factors
of the process:
 How long it takes a part to pass through the process from end to end.
 Amount of time spent adding value to a part. This can be attaching a
bolt, approving an order, or chopping lettuce for a salad; they all add
something to the item that makes it closer to being finished.
 Amount of time the part sits idle.
 Number of work-in-process parts. This number represents a company
investment in labor and materials, yet the objects haven’t reached final
form, and they can’t be sold. Until it reaches its final form, the in-process
material has little value. Examples of work-in-process material are a cus-
tomer service complaint that no one has addressed and a half-finished
truck hood.
 Distance traveled by each process worker in a day. This number is usu-
ally measured over a two-hour period and multiplied by 4.
During the 5S portion of the RIE on the second day (which we cover later in
this chapter), additional data is added to the scorecard to show how much
the 5S process improved the work area.
Figure 14-1 is an RIE scorecard featuring the previously noted categories. You
can use this form to organize your process-performance information before
you conduct the RIE.

Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Set improvement goals, such as a 40 percent reduction of work-in-process
materials, a 20 percent reduction in labor, or a 50 percent reduction in floor
space. Don’t set the goals too low, or the event won’t reach its full potential!
After your team completes the RIE, you rate performance again to show the
benefit (or lack of benefit) of all the work of the RIE. The summary report
determines future management support for RIEs. (See the section “The Fifth
Day: Finalize Changes and Report to Management,” later in this chapter.) To
be credible, the RIE scorecard must measure improvements over time. After
the dust settles and all the executive attention is turned elsewhere, the long-
term improvement must be verified as real. The last two columns of the
scorecard in Figure 14-1 provide a place to revisit the process one week later.
The First Day of the Event: 
Train the Team
Training your Rapid Improvement Event team is important. Individual work-
ers may know a lot about their process areas and the company as a whole,
but little about process engineering, for example. RIE tools and techniques
are easy to grasp, so a little bit of training goes a long way. You count on the
RIE leader and the company’s quality control manager to provide the training
on the first day.
Start the RIE on the first workday of the week. This allows time at the end of
the week in case the event runs longer than anticipated. The weekend before
the RIE provides a nice mental separation from the last workday, and the
team members will be fresher.
Workers involved with the RIE must appreciate that they’re the bosses, the
designers, and the troubleshooters (at least for the length of the event).
Team training must empower them to speak up, to challenge conventional
wisdom, and to offer suggestions for improving the process.
In the following sections, we go through the different types of training presen-
tations and discuss the types of lists and maps to create and update for the
event.
Kick off the RIE training with a short pep talk by the highest company execu-
tives available. Attendance by executives demonstrates the company’s com-
mitment and interest in the success of a program mostly run by individual
workers. RIEs are designed to generate a lot of employee enthusiasm, and the
presence of company leaders and their encouraging words help focus this
energy on the problems at hand.
245
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

Surveying important presentations
Each team member has knowledge of the specific job he or she holds, but
members lack expertise in other areas of the company frequented by other
team members. The first six hours of the first day is for training provided by
the RIE leader. Presentations center on the following topics:
 Team building
 Value Stream Mapping (see Chapter 12)
 5S (see Chapter 13)
 Waste identification (see Chapter 11 for details on eliminating seven
types of waste)
 Takt Time (see Chapter 11)
 Mistake proofing
 Spaghetti charts (see Chapter 13)
 Information security
We cover a few of these subjects in the following sections; you can check out
the previously noted chapters for full details on other presentation topics.
The RIE leader needs to set the team’s expectation of what’s possible within
the event. RIEs quickly (or rapidly, we suppose) generate short-term changes,
such as cleaning and rearranging a work area. Long-term changes, such as
the purchase of capital equipment, are beyond the limits of the event. The
RIE team documents the need for long-term improvements and passes the
documentation on to the RIE sponsor for consideration.
Team building
An RIE requires a new view of the workplace from its team members. People
work within an established pecking order. A few are outspoken, some are
obnoxious, and others will never work well together. Teamwork training aims
to break this mold and motivate employees to speak up and share their ideas.
It emphasizes examining ideas based on facts and not on personalities. The
success of the planned RIE rests on how well the RIE leader handles the
people issues (see “An experienced leader is essential,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for more about selecting a team leader).
Teamwork training discusses the various ways that people interact, and it
typically involves role-playing, a bit of lecture, and a lot of discussion.
Training emphasizes “knowing yourself” and recognizing the best ways to
communicate with others. Topics may include the following:
 Simple tests to help people identify their own personality traits
 Identifying and addressing interpersonal conflicts
246
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 Appreciating the value of different points of view
 Active listening
 Respect for others
The RIE leader must focus the training energy on the problem and prevent
team members from drifting astray, but he or she also must ensure that the
team receives full credit for their innovations. If your company fails to use
worker suggestions, the fostered enthusiasm will wither away, and future
RIEs will provide limited or no benefit.
Mistake proofing
People don’t intentionally make mistakes. Most often, the problem is poor
process design. Workers may perform the same tasks over and over all day
long. A worker isn’t a machine that can do everything the same way, every
time, all day long. Even a momentary distraction can cause an error.
Mistakes are expensive. Potential costs come in the following forms:
 Labor and materials to create a product that customers can’t use
 Labor for inspection because the process isn’t reliable
 Reworking, if possible
 Scrapping
 Delays in later processes that won’t receive enough material
The answer isn’t more inspection; it’s fixing the problem at the source.
Mistake proofing aims to develop tools, techniques, and processes to reduce
the chance of making mistakes. The objective is to prevent, or at least detect
and weed out, defects as early as possible in the process.
Mistake-proofing techniques fall into two primary categories, which the RIE
leader presents during the team training on the first day:
 Control, which eliminates the possibility of an error
 Warning, which detects that an error has occurred or may occur
The basic methods of mistake proofing are
 Elimination: Redesign the process to eliminate a problematic task or
part from the process. No task, no mistake! In a buffet, for example, if
customers select their own dishes, then the waitress can’t make mis-
takes with their orders.
 Replacement: Use a more reliable process in place of the faulty one. For
example, a technologically advanced company could use robots rather

Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

 Prevention: Redesign the components of a process to fit together the
only correct way. For example, software may require completing specific
fields on a screen before accepting what’s been entered.
Prevention is always preferred over detection. It’s better to prevent the
damage than to rework it after the error has already been made.
 Facilitation: Use visual controls to detect an error. One facilitation method
is to color-code components (connecting red to red, blue to blue, and so
on) so that it becomes obvious when an incorrect connection is made.
 Detection: Identifying an error before it leaves the workstation. One pos-
sible method is to provide a kit of parts to an assembler. If any parts
remain in the kit upon completion, the worker knows he or she omitted
something in the process.
 Mitigation: Designing products to include extra margins to guarantee some
aspect of performance, such as extra-strong components and thicker walls
than the minimum requirements to absorb machining stresses.
Information security
Some processes use sensitive data. During team training, the RIE leader
should address that target process changes must ensure the continuing secu-
rity of customer information. You need to protect personal information about
employees, customers, and patients from casual view; these aren’t only good
business practices, but also legally mandated.
Creating and updating lists and maps
As the discussions progress during the training session, the team should start
several process-improvement lists. You can tape the lists to the wall to share
knowledge among the team. Team members can walk up and add to the lists
at any time. For example, you may write down ideas for the following areas:
 Known process problems
 Critical-to-customer quality characteristics (focusing on product or serv-
ice performance, timely delivery, and cost; see Chapter 6 for details)
 Process wastes
 Possible areas for mistake proofing
Team members also discuss and update the Value Stream Map of the process
(see the section “Drawing a map of the process flow,” earlier in this chapter).
The map shows the difference between how the supervisor said the process
worked and how it really performs. Add the map to the wall.
248
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Team members should keep pads of stick-on notes handy. Expect to hear all
the process’s horror stories and special exceptions. Use the stick-on notes to
attach possible changes.
For the last part of the first day, the team should visit the work area and sim-
ulate the movement of the product through the target process. At each step,
the person(s) who works there can explain what’s done and why. Bring the
Value Stream Map and lists, and update them as needed. Team members can
point out areas for possible housekeeping, opportunities for mistake proof-
ing, and points of waste.
The Second Day: Review the Training
and Clean the Work Area
During the second day of the Rapid Improvement Event, you should briefly
review the first day’s training and the lists and maps on the wall. Add to and
update the lists you created on the first day:
 Value Stream Map: List any updates
 Known process problems: Bring up during the day’s discussions
 Critical-to-customer quality characteristics: Should be about final by now
 Process wastes: The less obvious wastes should appear
 Possible areas for mistake proofing: More ideas from the discussions
By now, the team sees the process from a new perspective, and you can iden-
tify areas for gathering further information. Examples include
 Quality reports on defects (see Chapter 4 for more about defects)
 Materials reports for components in and finished goods out
 Management reports on hours charged
 Measuring reports for the walk time for the process
Assign a team member to track down the desired information.
The RIE leader should release the team to apply 5S for the rest of the day (see
Chapter 13 for 5S details). Here are some tips for applying 5S during an RIE:
 Measure the amount of floor space used before and after the 5S event.
 Use the necessary cleaning supplies, provided by the RIE leader.
249
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

 Schedule facility maintenance support to move heavy items.
 Record every piece of material you send to the warehouse as savings,
including tools, assembly materials, common parts, shelves, and so on.
The Third Day: Draft the 
Improvement Plan
First thing in the morning on the third day of the RIE, the team should wrap
up any unfinished 5S activities from the second day. If the activities are fin-
ished, update the Value Stream Map and the process-improvement lists you
created on the first day.
At that point, you can stop dwelling in the past and start creating the future!
The RIE leader should moderate a discussion for each item on the lists:
 Known process problems: Figure out what the team can do to eliminate
each problem.
 Critical-to-customer quality characteristics: How can the team protect
or enhance these characteristics?
 Process wastes: Determine what the team can do to eliminate each waste.
 Possible areas for mistake proofing: How can the team modify the
process or work product to reduce the potential for errors?
Based on the suggestions you come up with, the team creates a future vision
for the process as a to be Value Stream Map. The new process should mini-
mize worker movement, simplify workflow, and reduce work-in-process mate-
rials. The new process must balance the work among the workstations to
provide a smooth flow and to eliminate bottlenecks. Changes to the work
area should be focused on achieving something specific (waste reduction,
less walk time, logical positioning of tools and materials, and so on). The RIE
leader should make sure the new objectives are clear to everyone on the team.
Hah! Service companies aren’t off the hook on this task. You can easily apply
a to be Value Stream Map to any work situations from firehouses (to sequence
equipment for fast grab-and-go when firefighters are dispatched) to the ways
that retail stores rearrange their clothes racks after hours.
If team members come up with contending ideas about the best way to
rebuild the process, set up experiments and try each of them out.
250
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

After this brainstorming meeting, the RIE team should meet with the mainte-
nance team to rearrange the process work area. If changes require new fix-
tures, include the tool room in the meeting. Both teams may work into the
evening to prepare the work area for the next day.
The Fourth Day: Test Changes 
and Document the Results
You spend the fourth day of the RIE finding out how well the redesigned
process works and then documenting the results for future reference.
Taking the revised process 
for some test drives
Every diamond has its flaws. Before rearranging everything to use the team’s
solution, take some time and run some tests. Briefly do things the new way to
shake out unforeseen problems. This is also a great time to fine-tune the new
process. Installing a new or modified process is an unnecessary risk because
it may do more harm than good.
Here are the steps for testing the improved process:
1. Complete the setup begun on day three, if necessary, and run the
revised process for a short time.
You usually run the process for 15 minutes.
2. Meet as a team and identify possible adjustments to improve the
process.
Record all changes and reasons for the changes before you make them.
3. Run the process again for a longer time.
This time, go for about a half hour.
4. Meet as a team and identify possible adjustments to improve the
process.
5. Repeat this back and forth as many times as it takes until the team
believes the process is as efficient as it can be.
251
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

6. Call the organization’s safety and information security managers over
to examine the process and approve the final design.
The new process must not violate any company guidelines for safety or
information security.
7. When the team believes it has improved the process as far as possible,
run the process one more time and fill in the “After the RIE” column
on the RIE scorecard (see Figure 14-2).
8. Calculate the gain or loss for each row of the card. Skip over the
column for “One Week Later” because those boxes are for use one
week later!
By the end of the fourth day, the process must be ready for use the following
Monday. Any changes that the team can’t complete by the end of the fourth
day go onto an “Open Issues” list.
Documenting your tests and research
The RIE team needs to document and standardize the new and improved
process. Part of this task is updating the work instructions for each process
station, with the applicable process supervisors reviewing and approving the
changes (see the earlier section “Discovering what the work instructions
say”). At that point, it becomes each supervisor’s responsibility to ensure
that workers follow the work instructions (no going back to the old way!).
This supervision makes the changes a permanent part of the process.
During the fourth day, update the lists with the latest information. Bullet
points should be clarified in sufficient detail.

The Fifth Day: Finalize Changes and
Report to Management
And on the fifth day, your RIE team shall not rest! Your team has the following
three things to do on the last day:
 Complete the “after” documentation
 Prepare a presentation to management
 Make the presentation
The team needs to make sure that all the paperwork for the final process
design is updated and ready for review, including the new Value Stream Map,
a spaghetti chart for process flow, and work instructions approved by the
process supervisors.
Some process and company-wide changes just take a long time. To accommo-
date these changes, create a list of recommended actions that your team
can’t complete during the current RIE. The list may include capital improve-
ments, tools that you can’t create on short notice, and so on.
The RIE team then drafts and presents a one-hour management report on the
completed RIE. The team members, especially the ones who will use the new
process, should make the greater part of the presentation. This reinforces
their commitment to embracing the “new way.” The audience should include,
at a minimum, the executive sponsor and as many managers in the chain of
leadership over the process. The report should include
 The former state of the process. Include the Value Stream Map, known
problems, critical-to-customer quality characteristics, rates, Takt Time,
quality issues, and any other pertinent information.
 The journey to your recommended solution. Include training discus-
sions, mistake-proofing suggestions and actions, waste discussions, pro-
posal tests, and 5S activities.
 The format of the new process.
 The RIE scorecard for before and after (refer to Figures 14-1 and 14-2).
 Open issues and recommendations for future capital improvements.
Companies have limited supplies of money, so RIEs need to demonstrate
their savings. A bit of public relations with the bosses ensures that they
understand the improvements made by the RIEs.
RIE improvements are measured in thousands of dollars per year, not mil-
lions. Still, it isn’t often that the workers can honestly say that they have 
253
Chapter 14: Empowering Workers to Make Changes with Rapid Improvement

personally improved the company’s financial situation. Simpler processes
provide higher quality through fewer chances to mess up. Some benefits
such as improved quality won’t be immediately apparent.
When the RIE is declared complete, the RIE leader collects the lists and other
documents created during the event. They’re used to improve the company-
wide RIE process training and progress evaluation.
One Week Later: Did the 
RIE Make a Difference?
People are creatures of habit and will drift back to the old and comfortable
ways of doing things. The real test of an RIE is to come back a week later and
reevaluate the new process. Sometimes, after running for a week, the learning
curve kicks in. People learn the new process and invent ways to improve it. In
most cases, all factors improve slightly. In some instances, what seemed to
be a great idea needs adjustment to accommodate unforeseen situations.
The RIE scorecard (refer to Figure 14-2) includes a column for taking mea-
surements one more time after the revised process has been running for a
week or so (each site selects what it thinks is a reasonable time to check
back). Recalculate the “Gain/Loss” column to record the process’s long-term
score (really, the only one that counts).

O
verstock sale! Some companies never seem to accurately predict their
materials requirements. They constantly buy more than they need, so
they must sell the excess at “giveaway” prices (or so they claim). Other com-
panies run ads with great deals on their products, but the items never seem
to be in stock. These companies deal with constant shortages, expedited
shipments, or piles of the wrong materials on hand. Over time, many compa-
nies accumulate odds and ends that suck up space but add little profit.
For this chapter, we focus on companies that must deal with excess (or incor-
rect) inventory. Companies often overstock to avoid problems. When a busi-
ness experiences a materials shortage, its workers have nothing to do, but
the company still has to pay them. To overcome this, managers purchase
more material than needed, just to have a cushion. Unfortunately, these cush-
ions of material build up; some can be used later, but some one-time materi-
als may never be needed again.
Excess materials cause big problems and drive up costs. Your organization
must move extra materials and store them somewhere. In some cases, you
may have to protect materials from moisture, heat, and a wide range of other
factors that cause products to decay, corrode, or shrink. And we haven’t even
mentioned possible theft and the loss of value while material sits and sits. So,
who needs the excess? Not you!

You want your organization to become as lean as possible, and a great way to
accomplish this is with a Lean system. A Lean Materials system is an important
component of Lean Processes (see Chapter 11). Companies apply it according
to their production volumes and unpredictability. Managers must select the
degrees of Lean Materials that fit their organizations’ situations. Along with
Lean Materials, you see other complementary techniques, such as Kanban
and Just In Time. Companies may use all three techniques in parts of the same
facility. As always, you should apply the tool that fits the problem at hand.
In this chapter, we explain the concept of Lean Materials and Kanban, and we
describe the pros and cons of the processes. We briefly touch on the Just In
Time approach so you can decide if it might work for you. We also show you
how to implement a successful Lean Materials process and work with suppli-
ers to keep everything on track.
Getting the Gist of Lean 
Materials and Kanban
Lean Materials is a technique for freeing up large quantities of company funds
currently tied up in materials that sit here and there around your facility. The
technique is most useful for materials-intensive operations, such as sites
retailing capital goods, food service companies, or factories. However, Lean
Materials can still save money for even the smallest business.
It takes a lot of money to make something. The cost of labor, tools, and mate-
rials used to create a product or service determines a unit cost of manufacture
(what it costs to make the product or service). The tool costs (buildings, con-
veyors, forklifts, and so on) are constant, whether the process is running or
sitting idle. The same goes for the labor; the cost of idleness is reflected in
the per-unit cost.
To minimize unit cost, manufacturers push to keep workers and expensive
machines fully occupied. To ensure that workers are busy and to lower acqui-
sition costs, many companies order a lot of material and place it around their
facilities. The companies purchase excess materials just in case they need
them. Sounds like hardware scattered around a messy garage!
Compounding this mess is a company’s desire to build up piles of finished
goods — the stuff it ships out the door to customers. It may be nice to have
items ready-made to ring up quick sales, but often this material sits around,
and the costs keep adding up.
256
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Together, these situations create some problems:
 Excess material in a facility takes up time when you move it to storage,
causes delays, and inhabits valuable floor space. Your organization has
to pay someone to track where it is, to periodically count it, and to issue
it when needed. If excess material goes bad in storage, you may have to
scramble to get a replacement load to keep the line running.
Think excess material is easy to manage? How many times has a product
sat in your pantry or refrigerator until after its expiration and after
you’ve purchased a duplicate product?
 If some portion of an assembly line stops, all the other workstations
keep going and piling up work-in-process goods until they run out of
material. Each “island” works as far ahead as it can, sometimes storing
semi-finished materials in a warehouse as it continues to make even
more goods that the next process step can’t handle!
This is where a Lean Materials process (including Kanban signals) comes in
to tackle problems. In the following sections, we describe the concepts of
Lean Materials and Kanban and explain how they make up a “Pull” produc-
tion method that’s better than a “Push” method.
Contemplating the concept 
of Lean Materials
Lean Materials removes most of the material in a facility, prompting a com-
pany to
 Order only the amount it needs
 Deliver the material to the workstations that need it
 Order and deliver materials only at the times it needs them
The only material that should sit in a work area is what the workers immedi-
ately need for use. (As Lean Materials managers say, “It’s a factory floor, not a
warehouse.”) This may be a scary idea for companies that always keep plenty
of material around to avoid running out. These packrats focus on pumping
out the most work from their processes and avoiding idle workers or machines.
The funny thing is, even though they tie up piles of money in materials, these
companies still run out.
Businesses build small stockpiles of material called buffers to cushion their
processes from variations in work speed and equipment reliability. Lean
257
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

Materials works to minimize buffers, but they never go away. Your organiza-
tion should set buffer size by examining the risk that your workers may run
out of material.
Big buffers hide problems that an organization ignores but should address.
Converting to Lean Materials reveals many of the sloppy scheduling and
materials issues hidden by excess inventories. Be ready to address these
issues as they emerge.
Supplementing a process with Kanban
A Kanban is an indicator, or a signal, that workers need more material in a
production process. The material may come from sub-assemblers within a
facility or from outside suppliers. In a Lean Materials context, Kanban is one
way you can manage the flow of Lean Materials throughout your facility. You
can implement basic Kanban where you provide material for empty contain-
ers, or you can use Kanban to its fullest to control the rate of production, as
well as the flow of materials. Most facilities use their own version of Kanban
based on their unique situations (and willingness to change).
How you use signals in a Kanban system is limited only by your creativity.
Each company establishes what works best for its processes. Some compa-
nies may trigger a signal when clerks scan the bar codes on empty contain-
ers. Other companies may use colored lights, turned on by workers and off
by supply clerks who bring in material. Some organizations even use Web
cameras that focus on work areas to see what’s needed from a distance. For
the most part, however, simple approaches cause the least confusion!
Another common Kanban signal is a card. Examples of information that you
can put on a Kanban card include the following:
 Contract numbers: An identifier of who supplied this material. You can
use the number to trace suppliers that send you junk to work with.
 Line location: The workstation that requests the container of parts.
 Lot number: Used by the supplier to identify the point in time that its
process created the pieces in a container. The number helps suppliers
pinpoint problems within their processes. Also, if a company or the sup-
plier detects a bad lot, all the containers from that lot can be returned.
 Part number: A unique identifier for the component needed (all the dif-
ferent screw sizes look the same to a near-sighted materials clerk). A
readable description makes the container easier to identify (as a result,
fewer people call requesting cases of size 5 blue “thingies”).
258
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 Quantities in a batch: The number of units in a container.
 Shelf location: Lets the delivery person know where to put a container
within the requesting workstation. (You’ll have a mess if the delivery
person drops all the boxes at once and walks away.)
 Supplier name: The name of your supplier and a telephone number for
contacting the company with problems.
 Unit of issue in readable form: For example, you may identify 12-ounce
tubes of frequency grease. You should put a different part number on 
6-ounce tubes so this unit-size description further describes the part
number.
The Kanban card in Figure 15-1 is for a container from an external supplier.
Both bar-coded (for reading into a machine) and readable information (for
anyone who wants to know the information) are available. A Kanban for an
internal order would be similar. In both cases, a company develops a format
that works best for its processes.

Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

Figure 15-2 illustrates how the basic Kanban approach works. Each process
within the process is loaded and ready to work. When the last process on the
right (the one closest to the customer, #3) passes its finished item to the cus-
tomer, this leaves a gap in front of the worker at that station. The worker
reaches to the left and takes the output of the previous process (#2) and
begins to work on it. Now that worker has a gap, so he reaches to his left and
takes the output of the first process. The first process relies on the materials
supplier to fill his gap.
The gaps (or Kanban cards) signal the processes to begin making more items
for the process chain. In an ideal continuous process, this give and take
occurs at an even rate. However, when no customer is present to take away
the finished item, the entire process stops.
Monitoring a great debate: 
Push versus Pull
How does a worker within your company or a supplier know when to send more
material to a point in the assembly process? Companies have refined various
techniques over the years, but all techniques fall in two general categories:
“Push” (predictive line stocking) or “Pull” (“I’ll tell you when I need it”).
 A Push materials management system is technology based. Computer
software defines the inventory a company requires based on its pro-
jected build rate.
 A Pull system is market oriented. The customer defines the production
rate. A company creates products to replace what it sells.
In the following sections, we explain the differences between Push and Pull,
and we explain why the Lean Materials method opts for the Pull system.

Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Pushing materials out
In traditional manufacturing, a company’s decision makers decide what it
needs to build, which translates into a bill of materials multiplied by the
number of units. (Every item built in a factory has an illustration that commu-
nicates the designer’s intent to the worker who has to build the item; the
drawing has a list of all the parts, called a bill of materials.) The company’s
supplier “rounds up” the needed parts to the next full container size it offers.
Often, the company orders its entire materials requirement at once to ensure
that everything is on site. As soon as all the materials are on hand, the com-
pany schedules the products to be built.
This Push system predicts what the company needs and automatically issues
material to the assembly line based on manufacturing forecasts. Often, this
strategy clogs the assembly areas with leftover parts not needed for immedi-
ate tasks. The parts remain to save the labor of sending them back and then
having to reorder them.
How about an everyday example of the Push system? In many countries, home-
owners keep small refrigerators and pantries. They purchase food almost every
day to ensure freshness. In the United States, however, consumers purchase
food in bulk from warehouse clubs and store the food at home. This strategy
requires space in the home; buyers have to keep track of inventory; and
inhabitants have to throw away expired food (which happens all too often).
Predictions can also come up short, which presents other problems. Say, for
example, that the first 90 percent of the units built in a process had sufficient
material, but at that point shortages of this part or that one start to appear.
261
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban
Food for thought: Kanban in everyday life
Many people like to describe the Kanban
system of materials management by using an
analogy to a grocery store. In this analogy, mul-
tiple items sit in their designated shelf locations.
A customer takes an item, and this action sends
an electronic signal to the warehouse that
describes what the store has sold and where
the manufacturer needs to restock. The ware-
house prepares a replacement for the exact
item and quantity sold. In modern supermarkets,
Kanban signals come from checkout scanners,
and the signals travel electronically to the ware-
house.
Another Kanban variation is the potato chip
truck. The truck drives from store to store,
where it examines the stock to see what prod-
ucts need refilling. Where a potato-chip rack
has a gap, the driver replenishes it from the
supply in the truck.

By the time the end of the manufacturing run nears, the company has to
order many small quantities of parts by express delivery.
It all comes back to costs. Management will have cost problems if it express-
orders small shipments or orders piles of materials to avoid shortages. If you
order high-quality materials delivered in the proper manner, your cost prob-
lems wouldn’t exist! That’s where the Pull system comes into play.
Pulling materials as needed
A Pull material management system resolves many of the problems created
by the Push system (see the previous section). After a company provides its
assembly line with its initial stock, it sends nothing else until workers request
it. This method ties material movement to actual production movement. You
can use Kanban signals to request the additional material (see “Supplementing
a process with Kanban” earlier in this chapter for details on these signals).
Pull-line stocking works best with continuous processes where the worksta-
tions essentially perform the same tasks all the time. One example is a com-
pany that assembles personal computers. You see variation in the different
components, such as more memory in this unit or a second hard drive in that
one, but the work is essentially the same. Another example is a company that
assembles trucks, furniture, or washing machines. The method can handle
variations among the product, but it requires close managing if your organi-
zation changes production frequently.
So, how do you know which materials are best for the Pull system? Materials
management can be as simple as ABC! ABC analysis ranks parts based on
their value, focusing management efforts on the components that have the
biggest financial impact on your organization:
 “A” parts: The most expensive or most critical to a process. “A” parts
are probably only 15 percent of the items you require, but they repre-
sent 80 percent of your total inventory value. You need to closely
manage these parts, which are candidates for Just In Time delivery.
A Just In Time item has little stock in the facility. Throughout the day, a
supplier delivers small quantities of the material. Typically, the supplier
delivers the material to a receiving dock very close to where it’s needed.
For example, a supplier may deliver driver’s seats every two hours, with
the seats already sequenced in the same order as they’ll appear on the
assembly line. Another example is a restaurant that has fish delivered
fresh every day from fishermen.
By receiving material in small batches, you use less floor space and
require less handling. Also, if you find a problem with the material, you
have fewer items to repair.
262
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

 “B” parts: The next 35 percent of the components you require, which
represent 15 percent of your inventory value. Together with “A” parts,
these parts work well for Pull-line stocking. In the restaurant, if the fish
are the “A” items (the most expensive and important), the B items could
include lettuce, an inexpensive material used to complement the fish.
 “C” parts: The last 50 percent of the pieces that go into your processes,
representing about 5 percent of your inventory value. “C” parts are usu-
ally common hardware like nuts, bolts, nails, and so on. You can get by
with keeping a small supply of these on hand. In the restaurant, “C”
parts may include napkins, bags of flour, salt, and so on. These items
may be bulky, but they’re inexpensive to buy in large quantities; how-
ever, you shouldn’t let them overwhelm your facility’s floor space.
Reviewing the Pros and 
Cons of Lean Materials
At first glance, Leaning your facility’s materials seems like a lot of work and a
lot of stress from the possibility of running out of materials. And it is a good
amount of work. In reality, though, switching to Lean Materials isn’t much
more work than what your company does today. You can enjoy some great
benefits if you can deal with the challenges that Lean Materials poses. In the
following sections, we present the pros and cons of this technique.
The pros
Lean Materials has great advantages if your organization properly imple-
ments it (see “Going with the Flow of Lean Materials” later in this chapter for
details on implementation). Pluses of Lean Materials include the following:
 Cost savings through
• Reduced taxes on stored materials
• Less inventory shrinkage (shrinkage is anything that reduces the
quantity or quality of goods)
• Reduced floor space taken up by materials
• Reduced administrative paperwork
• Reduced labor (you don’t need workers to count materials, verify
what’s in stock, and track where items are)
263
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

 Reduced handling and disposal of packing material
 Fewer problems from material lost in the facility
 Higher quality products
“Fresher” materials produce better products. Whether you work with
food for a kitchen (potential for rot) or metal items for a factory (poten-
tial for corrosion), storing materials for later use can lower quality.
 Faster problem identification and resolution.
Excess materials can hide problems. If some of the material is defective,
workers will toss it aside and use the extra. Sidestepping of this nature
does nothing to recapture the value of the scrap or to fix the problem.
The cons
A poorly planned implementation of Lean Materials can bring a business to
its knees. The cons of Lean Materials include the following:
 Receiving docks must be available around your facility, because having
smaller quantities of materials on hand means requiring more frequent
deliveries. If you receive material through a single dock, Lean Materials
will greatly increase your delivery vehicle traffic.
 Increased labor from
• The handling and shipping of reusable containers.
• The constant communications to suppliers about line stoppages.
• More frequent deliveries into your facility and movement to the
work areas.
• The potential redesigning of incoming parts packaging.
 Increased supplier costs (passed on in their prices), which your organi-
zation must negotiate. Consider these factors:
• Having fewer vendors to simplify your supply management
reduces flexibility and competition and raises prices.
• Supplier negotiations must include ways your organization can
reduce the cost of more frequent deliveries to your facility.
• Suppliers must reduce the size of their shipping containers and
packing material to minimize the amount of trash created from
their containers (see the section “Packing materials in the best
containers”).
• Small suppliers may find multiple daily deliveries too expensive.
Check out the following section for advice on how to work to solve these
potential disadvantages.

Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Going with the Flow of Lean Materials
A change to Lean Materials requires two things: faith and trust. Faith that
materials will be available when needed. Your faith will be well founded if you
plan work far enough in the future to obtain the materials when workers call
for them. Trust because it makes people very uneasy to lose their buffers of
materials.
In reality, most companies already operate with Lean Materials. They may
have plenty of “stuff” sitting around, but the only materials that count are the
ones needed. Often, companies must order materials on short notice to meet
a specific task anyway.
Companies often ease into Lean Materials slowly. One wrong move and the
entire facility will be sitting idle, waiting for a box of bolts.
To begin the Lean Materials journey, follow these steps:
1. Select the products to start with.
You have a couple of options:
• Start with an item that’s very expensive and hard to move. A truck-
assembly facility builds a bus or truck every three minutes. That’s
a lot of engines! Rather than build an inventory of large, expensive,
hard-to-move items, the company can schedule truckloads of
engines to arrive at the facility two hours before workers need
them. The result is a buffer (or store of materials) large enough to
guard against traffic delays but small enough to manage. (This is
an example of a Just In Time delivery of “A” parts, or expensive
items; see the section “Pulling materials as needed.”)
• A different starting point is selecting an item that’s too expensive
to sit around for long. For example, a PC manufacturer that has to
buy Operating System licenses represented as stickers attached to
each unit may select the stickers. Each sticker costs $70, and
10,000 snuggly fit inside a shoebox. Not the sort of item to order by
the truckload due to cost, yet the stickers are too valuable to mix
with other boxes in a truck!
2. Determine how many of the item you need in one day, one week, and
one month, adjusting for seasonal variables.
Under the Lean Materials technique, you pay attention to floor space.
The only material that should be on site is what you plan to use in the
near future (each company must determine what “near future” means).
Consider a medium/heavy-duty truck assembler in Ohio. Each vehicle
requires a standard-model steering wheel. Steering wheels are bulky and
made at a facility about 20 miles away.
265
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

3. Calculate how long it would take for a shipment of the minimum
amount to arrive from the supplier you work with.
This depends on how reliable your supplier is and how much lead time
it requires to create what you need. A dependable supplier works closely
with its customers and welcomes their forecasts of requirements (because
forecasts help the supplier to Lean out its materials). The farther away
the supplier, the longer it takes to react to a supply interruption. For exam-
ple, if the delivery truck has an accident, you must have enough material
on site to carry on until you can receive an emergency shipment.
In the case of the truck company, it takes 40 minutes for a shipment to
move from the supplier’s shipping dock to the buyer’s unloading area.
Therefore, the truck company should have enough steering wheels on
site to continue building trucks for the 40-minute travel time and for a
“safety time” of another 40 minutes.
4. Select the required containers and the number of units per container
for your item; this is the basic size for shipping.
The supplier must provide material in containers that are easy to move
to the assembly line. Container size is also dictated by the amount of
line-side space available for the item. In the case of the steering wheels,
each container holds enough material for two hours. The containers are
bulky, and the company has room for only two at a time. (See the follow-
ing section for more information on this topic.)
5. Specify the number of containers you want to begin with.
You determine this number by accounting for two items in the assembly
station rack, plus one ready to ship by the supplier, plus however many
you need in transit to ensure the production line doesn’t run out.
In the case of the steering wheels, the shipping containers rest on the
floor and not on a rack. However, the wheels come in special containers
that minimize bending and make it easy for workers to pick parts up.
6. Select a way to signal for another shipment (see the section
“Supplementing a process with Kanban” earlier in this chapter).
7. Fine-tune the number of containers you order by reducing the
number one at a time until you have the least amount of containers
circulating possible.
A well-tuned system should always be on the edge of running out.
Excess signals and materials encourage sloppy scheduling and a care-
less attitude toward materials.
The frequent shipment of expensive parts (“A” and “B” parts; see the earlier
section “Pulling materials as needed”) may make sense, but what about the
266
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

small, inexpensive items you use in multiple places — like nuts and bolts?
Well, you can store these items in supermarkets as close to your production
areas as you can. At the supermarket, materials come in containers suitable
for workers to carry, or they sit on wheeled carts. The key is that you’re able
to move the containers of materials without the use of forklifts. (For more on
supermarkets, see the later section “Setting up ‘supermarkets.’”)
In the following sections, we provide additional information on implementing
Lean Materials in your company. We explain how to choose the best contain-
ers for your needs, set up supermarkets, and arrange for easy deliveries to
keep your process on track. For more details on dealing with suppliers, see
the section “Working with Suppliers to Keep Lean Materials on Track” later in
this chapter.
What can you do if you have so much inventory that you need to get rid of
some before you start to implement Lean Materials? You should have enough
to fulfill project requirements for the next two weeks; anything more is a can-
didate for disposal. It isn’t unusual for companies to have enough parts to 
fulfill requirements for several years. To get rid of inventory, just follow 
these steps:
1. Implement 5S style “housekeeping,” which we describe in Chapter 13.
This cleaning removes excess inventory from the workplace and returns
materials to the warehouse for reissue. 5S organizes work areas for
better flow of material in and out.
2. Begin draining the warehouse of excess stocks. Often, this action
uncovers material your organization purchased for long-gone projects.
Packing materials in the best containers
A goal of Lean Materials is to receive only the parts and materials that you
need to reduce unneeded inventory. A big part of this reduction is receiving
containers that contain the right amount of parts and that don’t require
heavy machinery to maneuver. You can further Lean your processes by pro-
viding reusable containers, which cut down on trash and labor. We cover
these topics in the sections that follow.
Size matters: Selecting a container
An important part of Lean Materials is the delivery of small quantities of 
components. To deliver materials, a supplier loads parts into containers of
specific sizes — usually provided by the buyer. Parts come in various sizes,
so containers must also. An ideal container is small enough for a typical
267
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

worker to carry, yet large enough to hold the amount of material that meets
requirements.
Typically, a container should hold enough components to feed a process for
an hour (based on the production rate). However, the containers for common
hardware items, such as nuts and bolts, may hold enough for several days
due to their small size and minimal cost. For example, in a truck assembly
plant, containers of headlights may hold enough material for one hour’s
usage, but containers holding the small screws for installing the lights may
hold enough material for a week.
Lean recycling: Opting for reusable containers
Lean companies can provide local suppliers with reusable containers of the
correct size (see the previous section) and require them to fill the containers
with the correct number of pieces. This approach is practical for suppliers
who do a lot of business with a company. A benefit of these containers is 
that you no longer collect, compact, and pay to landfill the trash. They also
make line-side work areas much less cluttered. And, because you provide the
reusable containers, the seller should reduce its prices because the company
no longer provides the shipping containers.
A common problem with receiving parts in disposable containers comes in
the form of the material that suppliers pack it in (wooden pallets, cardboard
boxes, plastic bubble wrap, staples, tape, and so on). You pile up mounds of
trash with each shipment, which clutters the assembly areas. Workers have
to struggle to shove trash aside to pick out desired pieces.
But, disposable containers and packing materials are cheap. Suppliers use
them to minimize the costs of protecting materials in transit. Why not order
the goods without the packing? You can order material without it, but then
who’s responsible if the material arrives damaged? The middle ground for
Lean Materials is to use reusable containers, which you can provide to mini-
mize the worry from your suppliers.
Collecting reusable containers and issuing them to suppliers does create
additional work. Typically, after a delivery truck drops off its load, it picks up
the same number of empty containers to take for refilling. So, on one hand,
you have to account for the additional handling of the containers, but this
work is offset by the many benefits of using reusable containers.
Companies that supply a small amount of parts may find it expensive to
change to standard containers and shipment sizes. For these companies, you
can arrange for a materials aggregator (a third-party warehouse that receives
materials and sorts them) to receive materials and load them into the con-
tainers. This step increases the amount of material in process, which pro-
vides another argument in favor of having fewer suppliers.
268
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Setting up “supermarkets”
Lean Materials calls for the exchange of a large warehouse in favor of local
supermarkets. A supermarket is like a miniature warehouse in that materials
come from suppliers and are stored in this area. Each supermarket should
support one area of your facility; every part workers use in an area should
have another container sitting in a dedicated spot ready for use.
When an assembly line signals for more material, the refill can come from a
supermarket. A worker takes the material to the line, which leaves a gap on
the supermarket’s “shelf.” The gap signals the supplier to fill another con-
tainer with that part and send it over. (See the section “Supplementing a
process with Kanban” for more on signals.)
The following factors determine the amount of material you should store in a
supermarket:
 How close your supplier is. Japanese automakers keep their suppliers
within a one-hour radius of their factories, which helps to keep their
supermarkets small. If the only supplier for a part is located offshore,
you require a much larger safety stock.
 Speed of use. If you need a lot of parts, you should keep a lot of parts in
the supermarket. Some companies keep two hours worth of material on
the assembly line, with another two hours of material in a supermarket.
 Value of the component. Expensive materials should be delivered Just
In Time (see the earlier section “Pulling materials as needed”). Often, the
supplier delivers some to the supermarket, which holds a small buffer of
material, and then delivers to the nearby assembly area.
Arranging for smooth deliveries 
and working environments
You have two types of deliveries to consider in the Lean Materials process:
 Deliveries from the supplier. Suppliers make these deliveries several
times per day in Lean Materials, based on the items ordered. When the
materials arrive, the supplier delivers them directly to an assembly area
or to the various supermarkets (see the previous section).
 Deliveries from inside your facility. The ideal situation is having a
series of receiving docks near the assembly areas. As material arrives,
workers can remove it and reload the vehicles with empty containers,
269
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

which eliminates the need for forklifts and the like. Unfortunately, few
structures have multiple docks near multiple assembly areas, so the
only way to make this ideal a reality is to erect a new building.
More commonly, companies have material arrive at the docks of the
supermarkets. Workers separate material according to a delivery route
(like the postal service does with mail). Carts make scheduled runs from
the supermarkets to the work areas on prearranged routes. During the
routes, workers drop off material and collect empty containers.
Tight quantities — a staple of Lean Materials — means that materials can’t
have defects. Workers and their managers must have direct contact with sup-
pliers to resolve quality problems as they arise. Traditional companies pass
information through engineers, which slows down response time.
The purpose of material delivery is for a worker to use it. Your delivery work-
ers can drop shipments onto the floor and require workers to bend over, or
management can provide platforms at a more comfortable height. Raised
materials platforms aren’t a luxury; tired workers make mistakes. It all goes
into how you present parts to the worker for use.
Proper presentation makes parts easy to pick up and provides the shortest
path to application. Store parts in a logical order (perhaps from left to right),
and the presentation shouldn’t require the worker to contort his or her body
to maneuver the parts. You also should deliver containers with the minimum
amount of packing materials required to save time and energy on disposal (see
the section “Packing materials in the best containers” earlier in this chapter).
Working with Suppliers to Keep 
Lean Materials on Track
A funny thing about today’s business climate is that buyers and sellers fight
over nickels. The bigger picture is that both need each other. It’s expensive to
find good customers and to locate reliable suppliers. Instead of fighting, the
business-supplier relationship should be one of cooperation. We give you
some tips for working with suppliers in the following sections.
A supplier certification program is a useful tool. It ensures that a supplier pro-
vides high quality, trustworthy material, which eliminates the need for incom-
ing inspection. Certification also verifies that the supplier uses approved
packaging and delivers materials on time. For more details about making sure
that you work with quality suppliers, head to Chapter 3.
270
Part III: Whipping Quality Control into Shape with Lean Processes 

Encouraging supplier involvement 
to control costs
Converting to Lean Materials saves you some expense, but it also creates
expense for the supplier. After all, one reason companies have bloated inven-
tories is because taking on excess materials makes it easier on suppliers to
schedule shipments and ship in bulk — or so they think. If Lean Materials can
save you money, why can’t it save a supplier money as well? That depends on
the supplier’s supplier changing to Lean Materials. Here’s the point: If a
vendor doesn’t convert to Lean Materials, the movement of goods between
the facilities will be a constant struggle.
To control costs, many Lean Materials managers work with their suppliers as
partners to improve the process of moving goods between the companies.
The supplier can share its challenges in improving packaging and explain the
tradeoffs between alternatives. The key is in making Lean Materials easy for
the supplier to support and to fairly share the savings to cover their costs.
An important tool in supporting Lean suppliers is to provide them with
timely and accurate materials requirements. Timely information allows a sup-
plier to use Lean to schedule its own work. If a buyer makes “panic” calls
demanding substantial shipments on short notice, it motivates the supplier
to hold inventories to meet demand, driving up cost.
Most suppliers maintain stockpiles of finished goods ready for shipment. A
small amount gives the company a safety stock, but more than that means
the supplier is absorbing the cost of the buyer’s Lean efforts without realizing
the benefits (in fact, the supplier now needs Lean Materials!). Cost of capital,
warehouse space, shrinkage, the risk of items becoming obsolete, insurance
handling, and taxes can easily add 20 percent to the costs.
To further control costs, Lean facilities include their suppliers very early in
the new-product-design process. Together, a company and its supplier can
develop parts and processes that help both companies stay Lean and prof-
itable. This partnership avoids process waste.
As we’re sure you know in the business world, a good idea can begin to fall
apart when too many cooks enter the kitchen. Partnering with a supplier
means investing time to discover its processes and to break down communi-
cations and technology barriers between the companies. Every time a pur-
chasing team brings in another vendor that’s a few cents cheaper, the
coordination effort must begin anew.
271
Chapter 15: Looking at Lean Materials and Kanban

Convincing suppliers to ship in smaller lots
When a company receives materials in large containers, workers must
unpack it for use. If a worker uses only 10 of an item in a day, why would you
move 100 items to the assembly areas? If you’re dealing with a small, low-cost
item such as nuts or bolts, having excess isn’t an issue. However, if the item
in question is bulky, it will occupy valuable floor space on the line.
One reason that companies store items in large numbers along their lines is
that it’s time consuming to make multiple deliveries. This maximizes a deliv-
ery person’s time to the detriment of the worker on the line. Lean Materials
reverses this approach to minimize material on the line.
You should keep only the material you need on site, which means convincing
your suppliers to ship in smaller lots more frequently. Understandably, sup-
pliers need time to adjust to making smaller shipments. Often, this means
purchasing smaller delivery vehicles or hiring qualified workers. At some
point, though, the supplier either supports your purchase requirements or
doesn’t. You should replace suppliers that can’t ship the correct high-quality
material on time. If you don’t, your factory must maintain high safety stocks,
and you won’t realize all the possible savings from Lean Materials.
The fastest way to get a supplier’s attention is to promptly pay for the goods
received. The buyer establishes a process for rapidly accepting receipt of
incoming materials. The company can tie the electronic receipt to prompt
paperwork processing and payment. Typically, a Lean Materials operation pays
its vendors within 15 days, because it’s wasteful to hold payment until the last
minute (you waste time tracking, storing, monitoring, reporting, and so on).

Techniques

In this part . . .
T
his part looks at some of the better-known quality
improvement methodologies that have recently been
in fashion outside the realm of Lean. Each technique has
its own advantages and must be applied according to cir-
cumstances. For example, Total Quality Management
(TQM) uses a Plan-Do-Check-Act loop as an easy way to
illustrate how quality improvement is continuous and
something everyone can do.
Six Sigma is a statistics-driven approach for finding the
deeply buried root cause of a stubborn problem. The
process methodically examines, samples, and analyzes a
process to find out why a part of it does what no one
wants it to do.
Quality Function Deployment (QFD) links a process’s
specifications to customer desires; so, if a customer wants
more of a product feature, you can quickly identify the
processes that create that feature.
The last approach in this part is the Theory of Constraints,
which says that companies create their own constraints
to high quality. The approach demonstrates how to look
at quality as a company-wide issue, where problems are
often caused by misguided policies and narrowly focused
measurements.

T
otal Quality Management (TQM) may seem like something out of the ’80s —
sort of like “your father’s QC program.” In truth, most components of TQM
are still in use (for example, many people refer to Six Sigma, which we cover
in Chapter 17, as “TQM on stats”). TQM included mistake proofing, cycle time
reduction, and employee-led improvement teams long before these concepts
merged into the Lean approach (see Part III for details on Lean processes).
TQM is more than a few data-analysis tools; it’s a cultural attitude toward
everything “quality.” It provides customers (internal and external) with the
products and services that best satisfy their needs. TQM is a combination of
 Quality culture: This concept is a company-wide value system in which
workers focus on improving the quality of everything they do. Workers
discuss possible improvements at every meeting and in every report.
 Quality strategy: Strategy involves a published plan with specific tech-
niques and measurable goals for sustainable quality improvement.
 Process improvement tools: Employees use these tools to support the
program.
 Continuous quality improvement: This concept means that every
worker in the company feels empowered to improve his or her individual
processes and is encouraged to recommend changes to larger processes.
Each person takes ownership in order to make products right the first
time and to stop bad products from reaching the end of the line.
In this chapter, we cover the basic principles and steps of Total Quality Man-
agement and the techniques and tools your company needs to get started.

We also introduce the roles of different folks in TQM and show you how to
keep the quality process working continuously.
Total Quality Management in a Nutshell
Total Quality Management (TQM) is a company-wide, proactive effort to
improve quality. Total means that all business functions (engineering, produc-
tion, marketing, and so on) focus on defining and fulfilling (the ever-shifting)
customer needs. Each company tailors TQM to fit its circumstances. The uni-
fying theme is to “do the right things, the right way, the first time.”
TQM is a result of earlier quality innovations from such eminent experts as W.
Edwards Deming, Joseph Juran, Philip B. Crosby, and Kaoru Ishikawa. Like all
great ideas, it combines the best techniques of each innovator into a “total”
program. TQM was the first quality system that taught businesspeople to
look to the process steps in order to improve. One of its greatest improve-
ments was the realization that quality had to be moved out of the back office
and into everything an organization does.
In the following sections, we explain TQM’s principles, steps, pros, and cons.
The guiding principles
Total Quality Management requires your company executives’ ongoing com-
mitment to change. Rather than being the duty of a “quality department” in
some distant, dark back room, quality improvement becomes everyone’s
business. To be considered total, quality has to permeate all levels of the
organization. Here are the TQM principles:
 Management commitment: Quality improvement must be a daily topic.
Meetings have to include time for asking, “How can we improve this
process?”
 Employee empowerment: Resolving something on the spot is much
faster than going through the tedious steps of getting endless approvals.
Empower employees to immediately address problems they can resolve,
and reward them for passing issues beyond their control up the leader-
ship chain.
 Fast action: Management should quickly review suggestions for quality
improvements. Every day an idea sits in the in-box leads to another
day’s worth of defects.
 Fact-based decision making: You base decisions about changing work-
flow on data collected at critical points in the process. Data should be
the basis for decisions; you shouldn’t rely on whims of the moment.
276
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Customer focus: Keep the products in sync with ever-shifting customer
demands. Yesterday’s optional feature is today’s requirement. A cus-
tomer can be either the person purchasing the final product or the next
person working in a process. (See Chapter 6 for information on listening
to the customer.)
 Continuous improvement: Processes and products are never good
enough. You can always make improvements — to make the product
better, reduce its cost, or improve a process’s efficiency.
The major steps
Applying TQM to a quality problem is easy. Any worker in your organization
can apply TQM by following these steps:
1. Think of a quality problem in a process that you use every day.
Choose something that takes too long, occasionally fails, or delivers
faulty products.
2. Write a statement or brief explanation of what this process does.
For example, you could say, “Customers drop off the Web site and give
up trying to place orders because the page takes too long to load.”
3. Create a flowchart of the process.
Usually this flowchart follows the Value Stream Mapping process (see
Chapter 12). Sometimes, just a picture of the process suggests ways 
for improving it. The process flowchart should use one “box” for each
significant step in the process; this setup alone may point out possible
bottlenecks.
4. Write down the problems with the process, both large and small.
State each problem and its undesirable result. For example, the biggest
problem is a slow Web page (the problem) that causes customers to give
up (the undesirable result).
You may find many problems within the big problem. For example:
• The Web server is slow due to too many programs running at the
same time.
• The disks are slow.
• The disks need to be compacted for better performance.
5. Investigate the potential causes of the problems.
Use a fishbone diagram (flip to Chapter 17) to identify the various inputs
to the process. Identify several likely causes you can investigate further.
The example chart for the Web page would place “slow Web page” at the
head and each “fish bone” would identify the various parts of the process.
277
Chapter 16: Combining the Best of All Worlds in Total Quality Management

This chart ensures that you consider every aspect of the process. The
problem may lie in a place where no one ever normally looks!
6. Gather data on the defects, as we describe in Chapter 8.
Often, the defect reports are what start the review process. Display the
defect data on a Pareto chart (see Chapters 8 and 9 for more about this
chart) to identify the most frequently occurring problems — or the most
expensive defects. Focus on the significant few defects that cause the
most problems. Set the others aside for now.
For our example, you concentrate on gathering data on the problem Web
page’s performance. Get the numbers! At the same time, collect perfor-
mance data from the most likely problem areas, such as the Web server
CPU usage, disk utilization, and network speed.
7. Review past data on the process’s performance.
Display the quality results on a run chart, which indicates the number of
defects over time (see Chapter 10 for more about run charts). This chart
outlines whether the problems occur at some specific point in time or
with regular frequency. If you find historical data for any of the targeted
defect areas, compare it to the present to see if something has deterio-
rated over time.
8. After targeting the causes of the problems, apply a fishbone diagram
to identify all the sources of variation that go into the process.
You apply a fishbone to zero in on each potential problem area to see
what goes into it. With this information, you can point out where to try a
fix. Collecting a ton of data is time consuming; your goal is to zero in on
the most promising areas and minimize your efforts. The first fishbone
you created was for a general look; this one should be very specific.
9. Apply a control chart (see Chapter 10) to the identified problem
area(s) to determine the amount of variation that results and how well
the process meets the desired performance.
With the Web page, visually check the chart. When the page loads fast or
slow, what are the critical inputs doing? Often, you can see one of them
increasing or decreasing, likely causing the problem.
10. Identify the input variation with the greatest negative impact on the
product, and eliminate or adjust it.
Create a test where the suspected problem is varied up and down while
you monitor the Web page’s performance. If this seems to control the 
situation, you’ve likely found the problem.
11. Start all over again, driving out the next most frequent or most expen-
sive process defect.

Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

The pros and cons
Total Quality Management helps a company increase employee morale and
job satisfaction, as well as product quality. Other advantages of TQM include
 Increasing supplier, employee, and consumer satisfaction by identifying
and fulfilling customer requirements.
 Saving money by improving processes and reducing defects.
 Increasing productivity through less time lost to scrap, rework, or ineffi-
cient processes.
 Constantly improving the quality of products and services.
TQM, however, isn’t a cure-all quality technique. Cons include the following:
 Small continuous improvements take too long to show significant
results. In contrast, Six Sigma, which we cover in Chapter 17, strives for
breakthrough (major) process improvements.
 Company executives call for “total” quality management, but other man-
agement ranks may not be interested in the idea. TQM requires top man-
agement to consistently break down internal barriers of communication
and control to address problems.
 Empowering employees to change their own processes may result in
sub-optimizing the overall process as each worker strives to do as little
as possible. This situation leads to an endless dispute over which work-
station should do what task.
 Many TQM installations are inflexible, with only one way to do things.
This lack of flexibility means that tools may be forced on situations for
which they’re not suited. Your workers may say, “If all I have is a hammer,
every problem must be a nail.” What works best in the kitchen may not
work well in the accounting office.
Shedding Light on TQM 
Techniques and Tools
Total Quality Management doesn’t happen by itself, and it doesn’t magically
appear overnight. It requires executive support if you want to implement it
and keep it going. TQM, in this respect, is a lot like a fire. Someone must pre-
pare the fuel and light it. But with every success, the TQM flame feeds itself.
279
Chapter 16: Combining the Best of All Worlds in Total Quality Management

The more successful improvements your company makes, the more your
employees will support your efforts. Gradually, quality takes on a life of its
own as employees recognize it as the right thing to do.
And just like starting a fire, you need techniques for starting TQM and keep-
ing it going, and you need the proper tools. We introduce these techniques
and tools in the following sections.
Beginning with basic techniques
TQM achieves continuous improvement through the following techniques:
 Commitment of senior management and employees at all levels: At
every opportunity, the organization needs to emphasize and reinforce
that TQM is the responsibility of every employee. At every planning
meeting, ask the question, “How will that impact our quality?” In every
edition of the company newsletter, provide examples of how TQM has
improved some aspect of the company.
 Dedication to meeting customer requirements: Implement a process
for gathering and analyzing customer requirements and desires. (See
Chapter 6 for details.) Customer complaints and product returns send
powerful messages; they’re full of information about things the com-
pany can change. Feed this information to the people who can use it!
Time is essential. The sooner the problem is reported, the faster you 
can repair it.
 Improvement teams: Form groups of employees to address quality
problems as they’re uncovered. Big problems call for special, inter-
departmental teams. (See “Building improvement teams,” later in this
chapter, for more information.) TQM believes that employees know the
most about their daily activities and that they have high personal stan-
dards of performance. TQM empowers all employees to solve problems
with their processes. (See “The importance of empowered workers”
later in this chapter.)
 Reducing product and service costs: TQM reduces the chance of creat-
ing defective parts or building on defective parts. See the next section
for more about TQM’s emphasis on eliminating defects.
 Using challenging goals and benchmarking: A company needs to set
goals for everyone to work toward. You may set goals to reduce cus-
tomer complaints, have faster delivery times, or reduce reworked goods.
Here are some traits of goals and tips for using them:
• Choose goals the organization can easily measure, and make sure
managers regularly give employees feedback on their progress.
• Visit companies that are the “best in class” to see what they’ve done
to improve product quality — a technique known as benchmarking.
280
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

How does a top-rated restaurant provide top-notch service? How
does a five-star hotel handle its reservations? How does an
overnight express-delivery company keep its aircraft in the air at
all hours? With benchmarking, you learn from others so one day
you’ll be good enough for others to come visit you!
• Select goals that are challenging enough to encourage improve-
ment, though not so lofty that workers become discouraged. TQM
can’t fix a company overnight.
• Compare goals and results to both previous work done by the com-
pany and to work done by other companies.
 Recognition and celebration: When employees do a good job, let every-
one know. Share the success of the company with them (by giving paid
vacations, bonuses, promotions, and so on). This gives workers an
incentive to try harder in the future.
Emphasizing the deletion of defects
After you determine that a process creates bad results, try mistake proofing
it to fix the problem. Here are some good tips for doing so:
 Use techniques that limit errors. Many defects are preventable through
mistake proofing (see Chapter 14 for details on this process). Mistake
proofing uses tools such as connectors that can attach only one way or
pre-made kits with no extra parts (having pieces left over means some-
thing was left out). Web pages use drop-down boxes with the names of
states to prevent mistakes. Surgeons use checklists to ensure that every
instrument is accounted for before they sew up patients.
 Have a good system in place for detecting errors and fix them immedi-
ately. Your organization can find errors through detection methods such
as inspection, automatic weighing, clearance arms to ensure proper ori-
entation, and so on.
As soon as you detect a defect, stop the process and investigate the
source of the error. Make repairs to prevent the same mistake.
 If you can’t eliminate the chance of a defect, inspect the product
immediately after a problematic process step so defective parts don’t
continue down the line. When your workers find defective equipment
upfront, the company saves money on components and time later on. (We
cover inspection in Chapter 4.) Here are some examples of this action:
• If a circuit board doesn’t print properly, don’t add new compo-
nents to it; the final product won’t work later.
• If a loan application is unreadable, passing it on for a credit check
is useless.
281
Chapter 16: Combining the Best of All Worlds in Total Quality Management

Taking prompt action on data
Data is all around. Collecting quality data on processes and products is time
consuming. It takes time to take measurements. It takes time to review cus-
tomer complaints. All this time goes to waste if a process to turn this data
into prompt action isn’t in place.
Fast action on customer issues requires an internal process that can quickly
move the data to where someone can address it. Like fish, quality data and
customer feedback are most valuable when fresh.
TQM requires that companies create processes that promptly translate data
into action. These processes review the data, assign responsibility to a team
for action, and expect a prompt report. Whether the result is a simple adjust-
ment or a new quality improvement project, the speed of the company’s
response is a true reflection of how seriously it has embraced TQM.
Data collection is a straightforward process. If you plan it well, you have to
do it only once. If you plan it poorly, you have to do it over again, change a
part of the process, do it over again, and so on. For full details on data collec-
tion, see Chapter 8.
Surveying the tools of TQM
Looking at the following list of TQM tools, it’s easy to say, “Dude, you’ve been
ripped off!” Many of the tools in TQM are now part of “newer” quality processes,
but borrowing is the nature of quality systems. They take the best of the past
and let the process evolve to meet current requirements. In fairness, TQM
lifted most of the tools it uses from other quality programs:
 Brainstorming: A small team focuses on a quality problem, tossing out
whatever information about the issue comes to mind. One team member
then groups the notes, and the team uses the ideas as the basis of fur-
ther action. Brainstorming is most useful when a problem area or a
course of action isn’t obvious.
 Pareto chart: This chart is based on the 80/20 rule, which says that 20
percent of the issues cause 80 percent of the defects. This chart is a ver-
sion of a histogram with the highest (most significant) values on the left.
With TQM, you should focus efforts on the significant few. See Chapters
8 and 9 for more about histograms and Pareto charts.
 Scatter plots: These graphs are plots of dots where the X-axis represents
the characteristics tagged as the causes, and the Y-axis monitors effects.
This tool illustrates positive and negative relationships and indicates
trends and the dispersion of values. If the dots aren’t clustered around a
desired value, something must change! See Chapters 8 and 9 for details.
282
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Run chart: This chart shows the values for a characteristic over time; it
may identify points where external influences disrupt a process’s
output. Run charts can illustrate a process’s performance over time, and
they often highlight differences between shifts, operators, or even
between days of the week. See Chapter 10 for more on run charts.
 Control charts: This chart (based on a run chart) adds control limits
and a mean line that show when a process is getting out of control. Control
charts, which we discuss in Chapter 10, are valuable for plotting trends.
 Process flowcharts: A flowchart is a visual tool that shows the flow of
work through a process. Often, this tool is enough to identify where a
problem may be. See Chapter 12 for more about these charts.
 Fishbone diagrams: Also known as a cause-and-effect or Ishikawa dia-
gram (see Chapter 17), a fishbone diagram is a tool that lists, on one
sheet of paper, all the things that go into completing a task. The primary
bones are material, men, money, methods, machinery, and environment.
 Check sheets: A check sheet lists all the actions that must take place to
complete a task. As you complete a step, you check it off! Use these
tools to ensure that all important steps have been taken to fix a problem.
Check sheets are often used in data collection (see Chapters 7 and 8).
It Takes a Village: The Main TQM Players
A cornerstone of Total Quality Management is understanding your customers’
requirements and ensuring that your product fulfills them. Customers exist
both inside and outside of your company. The internal customers are the work-
ers who support the next step in a process. Increasing internal customer satis-
faction is the best way to increase external customer satisfaction. Each position
in the management chain works on improving internal customer satisfaction. In
the following sections, we cover who does what in TQM.
The role of executives
Executives play a crucial role in TQM because quality improvements take
time to analyze and install. The people at the top need to maintain a com-
pany-wide focus on quality issues. An executive’s job is to support quality ini-
tiatives and break down internal barriers to change. Ways to shatter internal
barriers (“ordering it” never works) include the following:
 Participate on process-improvement teams
 Create several teams (with members from each department) to tackle
company-wide problems
283
Chapter 16: Combining the Best of All Worlds in Total Quality Management

 Publicly promote success stories of process improvements made by
company teams
 Require all improvement teams to include at least one department that
supplies their input and one department that uses their output
Addressing quality issues takes executive attention away from other activities,
but management needs to stay focused on the program. A truism is that sub-
ordinates follow management’s example. If executives take quality improve-
ment to heart and act on it every day, so will their subordinates. If they defer
action and don’t apply it to the processes in the executive suite, they send
the clear message that TQM doesn’t matter.
The duties of middle managers
Middle managers have a critical role. They must set the example for applying
TQM in all their own processes while pressing their subordinates to do the
same. In short, if they believe in TQM and practice it daily, so will others.
In most companies, convincing middle managers to lead the TQM bandwagon
isn’t hard. They use it both as competition with other departments and to
create successes that they hope will lead to recognition and their own career
advancement.
Some companies create quality steering committees to oversee their TQM
processes. This decision assumes that someone outside the executive suite
has more time to address the issues, with a clear channel to executive row for
quick decisions. The quality steering committee provides constant oversight of
the TQM program and quick access to executive decisions when needed.
The importance of empowered workers
Just as TQM requires listening to the voice of the final customer, it requires
listening to the voice of the internal customer — the workers. To be success-
ful, TQM needs to become part of the company’s culture — a part of daily life
for all workers. Line workers (and office clerks, nurses, technicians, and so
on) are the ones who touch the products or perform the services daily. They
see when things are running well and can tell when something isn’t right. In
the following sections, we explain methods companies can use to involve
their employees in TQM.
Training workers on TQM
An important part of a TQM rollout is to train all workers on the program’s
principles and tools (see the earlier sections “The guiding principles” and
“Shedding Light on TQM Techniques and Tools”). This training ensures con-
sistent application of TQM. TQM training typically emphasizes
284
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Decision-making techniques: Rational ways to choose the best course
of action
 Interpersonal skills: Treating co-workers with respect, working in
teams, resolving conflict, and so on
 Solving quality problems: With the TQM toolset, walking each
employee through solving problems from his or her workplace
Most companies find it easier to hire instructors from consulting companies
to train and mentor employees. Executives and managers already have their
hands full keeping their regular jobs going and don’t have the time to create
training programs. Also, bringing in outsiders adds fresh insights into process
improvements. (See Chapter 5 for full details on employee training.)
You need to verify that the training is helpful and relevant. Keeping in touch
with employee needs and perceptions ensures that the final product has the
desired effect. Some companies use an end-of-course test to gauge how well
employees received the materials. However, the best way to evaluate the
training is to conclude the process with a mentored exercise where the class
works on real problems in their own work areas.
Implementing a suggestion program
An employee suggestion program is the cheapest, easiest, and most effective
quality improvement program. Human nature is to gloss over problems in
case someone views them as a failure of management. Employees who sug-
gest changes to their team leaders may have their ideas ignored. A sugges-
tion program bypasses these information filters; the new ideas go straight to
the top for consideration.
A suggestion program hinges on the fact that management considers every
idea, treats them with respect, and promptly investigates them. If manage-
ment ignores or insults ideas, employees may quickly stop submitting sug-
gestions. A management truism is that you get what you reward.
Speaking of rewards, companies have found that financial incentives keep the
suggestions flowing. If a worker’s idea saves the company thousands of dol-
lars in eliminated defects, why shouldn’t the company share some of these
benefits with the person who made them possible?
As the suggestion program piles on the savings, take time to tell everyone
about the program’s success. Publicly recognize the employees helping the
company. This attention confirms to the workers that management hears and
appreciates their voice, encouraging further participation.
Building improvement teams
The TQM techniques we cover earlier in this chapter are designed for groups.
Most work groups consist of the people who normally work together on a
task. Other times, a team includes representatives from many departments
285
Chapter 16: Combining the Best of All Worlds in Total Quality Management

trying to pinpoint a cause. Teams provide each member with an opportunity
and responsibility to contribute, a chance to lead, and an environment in
which to easily and quickly give and receive constructive criticism. In these
small groups, peers trade experiences, and informal training is possible.
TQM teams are empowered to make changes. If the change is large, risky, or
expensive, they assemble a business case for the change. Workers aren’t
expected to sit and wait.
The value of external customers 
and suppliers
External customers are critical to company success. Even if a company has
an immaculate staff of well-trained, hard-working, enthusiastic workers and a
managerial staff chock-full of devoted leaders, it can’t make a dime if it has no
customers. If customers become unsatisfied with a product and better alter-
natives are available, they’ll look elsewhere.
TQM thinks of processes as chains of customers. The output of one customer
is the input to the next. Understanding and fulfilling the next customer’s
requirements is important. Additionally, each worker in a company must
focus on the ultimate customer who purchases the finished item or service.
A company not only has customers, but also is one. Companies buy from sup-
pliers before they produce products for their customers. As such, companies
must ensure that suppliers hear their voices — the voice of the customer.
Otherwise, how do suppliers know which features of their products or ser-
vices to improve?
Customer satisfaction is one of the chief measures of success for a company.
Companies implementing TQM track the number of complaints per so many
parts sold or per customer. Each complaint provides another opportunity to
improve a product and make it more attractive to more customers. See
Chapter 3 for additional information on developing trusted suppliers.
Perpetual Motion: How to Enjoy
Continuous Improvement
Quality doesn’t just improve for a short while and then stop. Products always
have room for improvement. Your company can make them more durable,
provide more features, lower cost, and so on. When the innovation and
improvement process stagnates, so does the company.
286
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Continuous improvement starts at the individual level and leads to bigger
things. As a worker solves the problems within his or her control, manage-
ment should gradually point that employee toward bigger company issues.
Consistently supporting continuous improvement efforts is essential.
In the following sections, we give you the basics on the Plan-Do-Check-Act
cycle and explain how small improvements make a big difference in the long
run. We also show you how to overcome hurdles to continuous improvement.
Keeping TQM moving forward with 
the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle
TQM is a never-ending process. You can see this feature in the Plan-Do-Check-
Act (PDCA) loop, which we cover in more detail in Chapter 3:
 Plan: Careful planning keeps the improvement team focused on the cen-
tral issue it’s working on.
 Do: Change the process to eliminate the defect. Be sure to have a back-
out plan in case the change does more harm than good.
 Check: Monitor the changed process by using the same types of measure-
ments that you used to identify the problem. Measurable quality improve-
ment objectives make demonstrating process improvement easy.
 Act: Ensure the change is firmly entrenched into the process and that
the problem is fixed for good. Go back to the problem statement and
confirm that the change eliminated the problem. In many cases, the fix
eliminates some but not all the defects. Start all over again!
Watching small improvements add up
Some people feel that a true quality improvement effort must be expensive and
disruptive. Not true. Companies can reap the benefits of many small changes
for increased product flow, better quality, and happier customers if the execs
just permit the people doing the jobs to make the changes. These changes
should be discussed within the work team to ensure that they’re reasonable
(and to avoid having employees shove all their work on other people). In
most cases, the team approves the changes promptly, which keeps the
improvements clipping right along.
When workers can no longer make small, individual improvements, it’s time
to step back and evaluate the entire process for improvement. You can begin
to look at big picture changes. For example, you could move all the desks
around for better paper flow; you could change how you refill your patients’
records; or you could address the brightness of the work area lights.
287
Chapter 16: Combining the Best of All Worlds in Total Quality Management

Overcoming obstacles
Continuous improvement sounds so simple on the surface. After all, why
wouldn’t someone leap at the chance to improve a process? But obstacles do
exist. The following list presents a few obstacles and tips for handling them:
 Resistance to change: Some people may not be happy with the current
situation, but they think that any disruption to the process is just as
likely to make the problem worse as it is to make it better. Your best bet
is to address any of their concerns before making a change. In some
cases, any change is considered bad, so a push from the local manager
may be necessary to put an improvement in service.
 Challenges of making continuous improvement a daily activity: An
occasional problem-solving meeting is one thing, but to practice improve-
ments daily on all tasks large and small involves a significant workplace
change. To gain the continuous improvement “habit,” supervisors should
hold 15-minute monthly meetings to highlight successes and discuss
ways to identify what to improve.
 Watching the program grind to a halt after all the easy and obvious
problems are fixed: To keep TQM moving at this point, you can point
the individual workers toward specific strategic goals and look for ways
they can improve their processes in support of these companywide
issues. Examples of goals include reducing the number of late deliveries,
cutting down on the number of dropped calls at the help desk, reducing
the time required to process a loan application, and so on.

with Six Sigma
In This Chapter

E
veryone has had a job where some part of it has never worked right — 
a persistent problem that annoys everyone but doesn’t seem to have an
obvious cause. From time to time, someone tests a solution, but nothing seems
to work. If a company has a stubborn problem — something that employees
have to work around — then Six Sigma may be the answer to their prayers.
Six Sigma is a collection of quality improvement techniques that identify the
root causes of problems in production or service-delivery processes. It uses
quality-analysis techniques and a broad application of statistics to pinpoint
the process inputs that cause the undesired outputs. The techniques work to
minimize the variation of inputs and produce more consistent products.
Some quality improvement techniques, such as the Total Quality Management
(TQM) method that we describe in Chapter 16, seek to make small improve-
ments that add up over time to a big improvement. Six Sigma, however, focuses
on breakthrough improvements. It’s the best tool for fixing those stubborn,
they’ve-always-been-this-way problems.
In this chapter, we cover the basic principles of Six Sigma, walk you through
the main steps, and give you a few important formulas (including what the
“sigma” actually means). We also explain how your organization can use a
few analysis tools and introduce you to some advanced variations of Six
Sigma. For more information on the Six Sigma method, check out Six Sigma
For Dummies, by Craig Gygi, Neil DeCarlo, and Bruce Williams (Wiley).

A sigma (σ) is a statistical indication of variation. Statistics is a technique
used to make a judgment about an entire group of people or items based 
on only a few. The study of statistics isn’t for everyone; however, just as an
understanding of electronics isn’t necessary to use a PC, an understanding of
statistics isn’t necessary to grasp how Six Sigma works its magic within your
company. If you’re curious about the role of statistics in quality, though,
check out Chapter 9 for the basics.
Surveying the Basics of 
the Six Sigma Way
The Six Sigma process is a collection of tools. The key is to find out enough
about each tool so that you apply the right one to the right situation. After
all, someone may be able to drive a screw with a hammer but won’t be able
to loosen a nail with a wrench. In the following sections, we introduce the
important components of Six Sigma, such as the use of statistics, the goal 
of breakthrough results, and the importance of experts. We also list the 
pros and cons of the Six Sigma way.
Injecting statistics into tried-and-true
methods: The foundation
Six Sigma has a quirky label (as if Six Sigma isn’t catchy enough): “TQM 
on Stats.” The concept is nothing radically new. It borrows heavily from 
Total Quality Management (TQM) process analyses (see Chapter 16), 
Lean Techniques (see the chapters of Part III), and about any other quality
improvement method that works. What Six Sigma does differently is to bind
these techniques tightly by using statistics to create data-driven decisions.
Cynics say that “figures lie and liars figure,” but when you walk company exec-
utives or other employees through a Six Sigma report, you’ll be able to see the
lights come on as the statistics you gather methodically sample inputs into a
process and pinpoint the cause of why the output sometimes isn’t right. And
after you butter up the onlookers, you can go for the kill by showing them an
experiment where your QC team varies the problem input in a controlled envi-
ronment to make the problem appear and disappear at will.
Driving for breakthrough results: The goal
Some improvement techniques shoot for small, constant improvements that
usually require no permission to install and come with little cost. Over time,
290
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

the accumulation of small improvements pays off, like water drops that even-
tually fill a bucket. Six Sigma’s approach, on the other hand, is to find the
monster haunting a process and kill it with a single stroke, which can bring
large and immediate benefits (see the later section “The pros and cons of Six
Sigma: The dealbreakers”).
Six Sigma believes nothing in a process is sacred. Often, the solution to a 
problem lies in an area that workers believe is flawless or that’s politically
untouchable (such as a part of the process implemented and fawned over by 
a company executive). By eliminating the infected area or altering it so that it
runs smoother, Six Sigma can increase positive output substantially. When
processes represent a collection of personal preferences and internal politics,
Six Sigma can make big changes — all based on the data your team collects.
Here are some justifications you may hear that should serve as clues about
seemingly “untouchable” processes:
 “We always do things that way.”
 “The boss protects jobs so he becomes more important.”
 “That was some executive’s pet project.”
 “Corporate headquarters requires this part of the process.”
 “The last guy did it this way, so I’m going to follow suit so I don’t get 
into trouble.”
Meeting Six Sigma experts: The necessity
An important resource for starting and running a Six Sigma program is a certi-
fied Six Sigma expert. The expert provides encouragement, pointers on what to
try next, and a kick in the pants for lazy Six Sigma students. In most organiza-
tions, the expert is the driving force that keeps the program moving forward.
One of the odder aspects of Six Sigma is its use of martial arts analogies to
indicate the expertise levels of Six Sigma practitioners. Experts range from
those familiar with the techniques to masters of the art. The typical Six Sigma
expertise levels are
 Champion: Requires two days of training for executives. The training
explains how to break down the internal political barriers that prevent
improvement and how to manage the Six Sigma process.
 Yellow Belt: Requires two days of training. A Yellow Belt works part time
as a Green or Black Belt team member.
 Green Belt: Requires one week of training and one completed project. 
A Green Belt works part time in his or her own department addressing
problems.
291
Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

 Black Belt: Requires four weeks of training, a passed written exam, and two
completed projects. A Black Belt works full-time on process issues, trains
Green and Yellow Belt team members, and mentors his or her projects.
 Master Black Belt: Requires experience as a Black Belt and completion
of an enterprise-wide project. A Master trains and mentors Black Belt
team members.
Most companies use outside experts to get their program well underway. 
At about six months, a company hires a Master Black Belt as a full-time
employee and begins training several of its most promising Black Belts to be
Master Black Belts. A key emphasis in Six Sigma training is to reinforce what
employees learn by working on real projects that benefit their employers.
Often, the savings from the project more than pays for the training.
Don’t waste time looking for a “standard” organization for certifying an
employee as a Six Sigma “belt.” The best bet for an employee interested in Six
Sigma certification is to look for a reputable organization that specializes in
quality improvement. Here are a few we can recommend:
 American Society for Quality (ASQ): www.asq.org/training-and-
certification.html
 Juran Institute: www.juran.com/ store/results.cfm?category=4
 Datazinc: www.datazinc.com
 Six Sigma Qualtec: www.sixsigmaqualtec.com
 Air Academy Associates: www.airacad.com/
SpecializedToolsTraining.aspx
Considering the pros and cons of 
Six Sigma: The dealbreakers
Like many good things in life, Six Sigma’s advantages may be offset by its limi-
tations. When it comes to mysterious and persistent process problems, the
technique shines. However, in most situations, Six Sigma is more than what
an organization needs. A hammer is a great tool for pounding a nail, but it’s a
bit much for swatting a spider, if you catch our drift.
The pros of Six Sigma include the following:
 Elimination of stubborn problems by identifying their root causes
 Effective customer- and cost-focused quality technique
 Breakthrough process improvements (see the earlier section “Driving for
breakthrough results: The goal”)
292
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Typical annual savings of $250,000 per Black Belt project (see the 
previous section for more expert information)
Six Sigma isn’t the right tool for every situation, however. The techniques
involved take time to work their magic. Six Sigma programs have failed in
numerous companies that have tried to apply them to all sorts of problems.
You need to avoid the thinking that “If all I have is a hammer, every problem
is a nail.” Cons of Six Sigma include the following:
 It takes time to run a Six Sigma project. A solution typically requires
three to six months.
 A program requires an investment in training employees (see the section
“Meeting Six Sigma experts: The necessity” for more on training).
 Over time, executives may become bored and stop breaking down 
internal barriers for projects.
 A Six Sigma program works best after a company applies other process-
improvement techniques to address simple issues. Most companies
apply Lean processes (Chapter 11) and 5S (Chapter 13) prior to imple-
menting Six Sigma, which clears up the easy issues and leaves the tough
nuts for Six Sigma to crack.
Taking Important Steps to 
Implement Six Sigma
Starting a Six Sigma initiative in a company is a big step. Properly done, it 
generates excitement and high expectations across the company (although
you shouldn’t let those expectations rise too high). The key is to carefully plan
what to do and who will participate. Make the first impression a good one!
In the following sections, we explain the importance of selecting a good 
project (or a good bad project, we suppose); we walk you through steps 
that your organization should complete before you implement Six Sigma; 
and we get to the heart of Six Sigma with a process called DMAIC.
Project selection: The key to success
The careful selection of projects is essential for Six Sigma to be successful. An
organization must choose a project based on its potential benefit in cost sav-
ings and customer satisfaction, and the decision can be a tough one. Not every
Six Sigma project must save money. If a problem has an impact on customer
satisfaction or product or service quality, fixing it is just the right thing to do.
293
Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

Often, a Six Sigma expert must root out a problem that needs to be solved (see
the earlier section “Meeting Six Sigma experts: The necessity” for more on Six
Sigma experts). Why do we say “root out”? We’re not implying that your com-
pany has a lack of problems; the more likely scenario is that your managers
are reluctant to admit that any problems exist in their departments.
We give examples of good and bad project selections in the following sections.
Good projects to fix
The following list presents some areas your quality team may want to investi-
gate for possible Six Sigma projects. At this stage, your quality team is just
building a list of potential problems. After you identify the problems you
want to correct, the Six Sigma team focuses on correcting the problem, no
matter where it resides in your process.
 Customer complaints
 Scrapped materials
 Reworked material
 Customer returns
 Warranty claims
 Overtime labor
 Excess inventory
 Cost to deliver product or service
 Cost of customer service
 Operating below industry norms
Bad projects to fix
Avoid selecting the following projects for Six Sigma implementation:
 Projects with a predetermined solution. If the solution is obvious, 
why spend time studying it? Try the “obvious” solution first and then
apply Six Sigma if it doesn’t solve the problem. For example: A shipping
department’s scanner guns can’t read the bar codes on outgoing con-
tainers, which causes record-keeping errors. The IT manager is cutting
costs by forcing employees to use old, unreliable equipment.
 Projects that cross department boundaries without executive support.
Turf battles between managers can kill a quality improvement project.
(This is often the reason that no one has tried to fix a problematic
process before.) Top bosses must champion a project and break down
internal barriers. A Six Sigma Champion should address this issue; one
of the Champion’s roles is to address internal political struggles (see the
section “Meeting Six Sigma experts: The necessity”).
294
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Projects focused purely on headcount reduction. The focus should be
on improving a process, and if fewer workers are required afterward, let
that be a result and not the goal of the improvement project. Some com-
panies take pains to reassign all displaced workers in order to maintain
labor goodwill toward their Six Sigma programs.
Proceed with caution: Doing upfront work
before you implement Six Sigma
Before your quality team implements Six Sigma on a problematic process
within your organization, you need to follow these steps:
1. Examine the process you’ve selected (see the previous section) and
try to eliminate it all together.
This advice shocks people, but upon examination, you may find that the
requirement to make an improvement may no longer exist. Why improve
a process that your organization should blow up?
For example, in one data center, a study was made for a more efficient
way to print reports and stage them for pickup. The final answer was 
to send all reports to local printers, where the person requesting them
could pick them up and eliminate the print room altogether.
2. Clean up the problematic process with Lean techniques (which we
cover in the chapters of Part III).
Beginning with Lean simplifies the steps of Six Sigma and often resolves
the problem entirely. If the problem persists, the factors are now easier
to identify.
DMAIC: A five-step program, 
Six Sigma style
Six Sigma uses a five-phase approach for attacking a quality problem: Define,
Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (better known as DMAIC). We explain
the five phases in detail in the following sections.
Define
This stage makes clear what the problem is and how you measure it. Now’s
the time to set the boundaries of the study and explain how the defect
impacts customer perceptions. Here are the steps you take to define:
295
Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

1. Clearly state the problem to keep your effort focused. One method 
of defining a problem is describing exactly what’s meant by the term
“defect” (see Chapter 4 for more about defects). Here are some ques-
tions you should ask:
• How many defects can the item or service have? If it has just one, is
the whole product or service bad, or is it acceptable to customers?
• How do you measure defects? Each type of defect likely has a 
different cause, and you must identify each separately.
2. Investigate the process to understand how it should be working. A Six
Sigma expert asks questions of everyone involved with the process in
order to look for the problem’s obvious solution. Each worker has an 
opinion on the cause, which is referred to as tribal knowledge. Sometimes,
many workers know the problem’s solution but lack political clout to fix it.
Before you proceed, try the recommended solution.
If the tribal-knowledge approach fixes the problem, the entire effort 
is a success. Go on to the next Six Sigma project. Your goal is to solve
process problems, not to awe your co-workers with Six Sigma statistics.
If the tribal-knowledge approach fails, you must dig further into the
process. A Six Sigma maxim is, “We don’t know what we don’t know.” In
other words, you don’t know the right question to ask at this stage, so
you can’t find the right answer.
Some tools typically used at this point are Value Stream Maps to visual-
ize the process (see Chapter 12) and Standard Input and Output Charts
(see the section “Painting a complete picture with a SIPOC”) to break
down a process into its major components.
3. Identify the value the process adds from the customer’s point of view.
For example, does the process add paint to an item? Put an order confir-
mation into the mail? How does the process transform the item (or ser-
vice) that the customer is willing to pay for?
4. Mark out the project boundaries (so you don’t try to solve all the
world’s problems at once). Company employees don’t make visits to
customer sites. In the manufacturing world, boundaries are usually the
process’s beginning and end within the facility. In the service world, the
boundaries are usually the same. However, if your investigation points
to a defect involving poor material received from a supplier, you must
change the boundaries.
Measure
After you define the problem within the process you select, the Six Sigma
expert on staff should validate that the process is repeatable and capable of
delivering what your customers need. This validation points toward fixing the
process or looking for variation in the inputs. (See Chapter 10 for more on
assessing quality.)
296
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

If the expert determines that the problem is in the process, you look for vari-
ation there. Your process’s tooling, design, and materials may not be capable
of consistently delivering what your customers desire. When a correct prod-
uct appears, it may be more of an accident than something your company
can rely on.
If the expert determines that the process is capable and repeatable, however,
the variation must be in the inputs. In that case, you follow these steps:
1. Consider all the process inputs (men, machines, methods, environ-
ment, or materials) to identify variations (see the sections “Measuring
variation with x’s and Y’s” and “Organizing process inputs with
Ishikawa’s Fishbone,” later in this chapter, for more details). Variation
may be one of the following types:
• Positional: Variation within the part in question or between
machines or operators. Make several measurements on the 
same piece.
• Cyclical: Variation from part to part in the same batch or between
batches. Make measurements on different pieces.
• Temporal: Changes that happen over time. Maybe the parts are
worse on Mondays, you see variation between shifts, or you notice
an hour-by-hour difference.
2. Map the process and measure its overall performance. At this point,
you update the SIPOC and Value Stream Maps you create at the defini-
tion stage (see the previous section). Note the performance measure-
ments made on the process map where they occur.
3. Review the process to find a point to begin collecting data (see
Chapter 8 for more about data collection). The team begins zeroing in
on where the problem may be. Up to now, the analysis has been on the
process in general to identify these points for in-depth review.
4. Gather information on previous defects. Look for inspection records
for this part of the process. You’re constantly trying to tighten the point
where the defect may occur while remaining flexible enough to chase
the problem wherever the data takes your team.
5. Verify that the way you detect defects is correct and consistent. In
some cases, the defect either exists or it doesn’t (like a dent or a missed
field in an order form). In other cases, the defect is that a product is too
short, too long, not strong enough, and so on. You identify each of these
defect types through measuring something. You must confirm that the
way you detect a defect (or measure it) is valid.
If you detect the defect by inspection (see Chapter 4), you can provide
pictures of good and bad results. If you detect the defect with a measur-
ing device (micrometer, voltmeter, and so on), you should prove that the
297
Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

device making the measurement is accurate. At this point, you’ve looked
at the entire process and zeroed in on one or more places (or process
steps) to focus on. You can’t spread your Six Sigma efforts everywhere —
it would take way too long.
Analyze
During the analyze phase, you examine your collected data and, in many
cases, collect even more. Sometimes, your data leads you to believe that
other process steps require data collection and analysis. And just like an 
old detective story, sometimes data leads to a dead end.
The final goal of this phase is to identify the cause of the defect. In general,
the defect will be a variation in one of the inputs. Here, we lay out the 
analyze phase:
1. Analyze the data you collect during the measuring stage (see the pre-
vious section) to identify the cause of the variation. When one of the
inputs changes, what happens to the output? Look for statistical interac-
tions between the inputs. There are times when a problem occurs only
when two random things meet at once; sort of like two feuding people
that can fight only when brought together. Statistical interactions show
that this occurs in a process. An example may be when an operator from
deep in the Mississippi countryside takes a service call from an excited
person in Boston.
2. Pinpoint any areas of improvement. Often, this step requires additional
measurement. When you give attention to a process, it isn’t unusual to
identify small improvements you can make that aren’t a part of the Six
Sigma investigation.
Improve
During the improve phase, you form ideas about how to fix the problem in
your process. This can be the most fun (or the most frustrating) part of the
Six Sigma experience. Based on the data you’ve collected, your team pro-
poses one or more ways to change the process to eliminate the problem. If a
proposed change is cheap (such as changing the sequence of process steps),
you can easily test it. If the change requires an expensive piece of equipment,
the team must prove that the purchase will fix the problem (a tough but not
impossible task).
Here are the steps you go through in the improvement phase:
1. Begin improving the guilty process step(s) by identifying ways to fix
it. Based on the data you’ve collected, create a list of actions for correct-
ing the problem. One or two major things and many minor things gener-
ally cause a defect. Focus on correcting the major issues, and if the
minor causes are obvious and easy to fix, clean them up also.
298
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

2. Experiment with various solutions, and propose the one that solves
the problem with the least amount of cost or complexity. This step can
be fun. It involves purposely varying the input you think causes the
problem to prove your theory. If you find the right cause, everyone can
watch as your team makes the elusive defect appear and disappear at
will by varying the guilty input.
3. Obtain approval and install the solution. With the true problem’s iden-
tity proven, your team proposes a solution to eliminate the problem.
Draft a proposal for changing the process for approval by the project’s
sponsor (see Chapter 5 for more on sponsors).
4. Look for mistake-proofing opportunities (see Chapter 14 for more
about mistake proofing). When eliminating the problem, look for ways
to reduce the chance that it will ever appear again.
5. Statistically demonstrate the amount of improvement in the process
after you implement the solution (see Chapter 9 for more on the role
of statistics). After you implement the fix, compare the result to the orig-
inal defect level — the true test that the process is really repaired. In
some cases, you can prove the result immediately. However, many com-
panies wait anywhere from two weeks to a month before sampling the
error rate to prove the change made the process better and not worse.
Control
An important part of Six Sigma is controlling the process you improve so that
it stays fixed. After you take steps to improve the process, implement a con-
trol process that alerts you if the process changes back to its dysfunctional
ways. A control process also ensures that workers don’t go back to the “old
way” of doing something.
Six Sigma teams can maintain control several ways. One way is to monitor the
quality of the output to see if the defect reappears. However, the monster
may awaken later when no one is watching. Another way is to review an
FMEA chart you create (see the section “Putting Everything Together with
Process-Review Tools” later in this chapter).
Crunching Some Six Sigma Numbers
A hallmark of the Six Sigma process is its dependence on hard data (which you
can see in the DMAIC steps from the previous section). Instead of having each
person on your quality team read and interpret every line of data you collect
during a Six Sigma project, you can summarize it by using numbers to indicate
relationships. For example, you may want to examine the relationship of how
many units were started versus how many were completed the first time
299
Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

through a process without rework — known as the Rolled Throughput Yield
(RTY) — in order to identify a variation (a problem in the process). In the fol-
lowing sections, we show you how to calculate RTY, explain the meaning of
“Sigma” in Six Sigma, and give you a few handy ways to interpret process data.
Calculating the Rolled Throughput Yield
The most important part of any process is the result — the finished product
or service that you produce or deliver. The Rolled Throughput Yield (RTY) is
the number of finished units a process produces the first time through with-
out any rework. RTY is an indicator of the number of units that go into a
process compared to the number that come out complete at the end. The
higher the RTY, the more efficient the process.
The RTY is mathematically related to the Sigma level, but explaining natural
logs (mathematical logs, not big wooden sticks) isn’t something for this For
Dummies book (sorry for the curious!).
In Figure 17-1, you can see material on the left that’s entering a process. After
entry, workers handle the material, and most of it exits to the right as finished
goods. However, a small amount of material is defective and is set aside and
restarted through the process for rework or total scrap.
Unfortunately, life isn’t as simple as a one-step process. Imagine a three-step
process in shaping wood:
 In the first step, 100 pieces of wood enter the process, but the workers
make only 95 properly for the second step. The workers didn’t cut the
other 5 pieces according to specification, so the pieces are discarded.
 The second step takes the output from the first and makes additional
cuts. Of the 95 pieces that enter the second step, only 98 percent (93
pieces) are fit to pass on. The other two pieces are discarded.
 The third step takes the results from the second and drills some holes
into the wood pieces as a finishing touch. Of the pieces that enter the
third step, 99 percent (92 pieces total) are delivered as finished products.
So, you calculate the Rolled Throughput Yield by multiplying the percent of
good material that leaves each process step. Here are the results for the
wood example:
Step 1: 95 ÷ 100 = 0.95 (95 percent)
Step 2: 93 ÷ 95 = 0.978 (98 percent)
Step 3: 92 ÷ 93 = 0.989 (99 percent)
RTY: 95 percent × 98 percent × 99 percent = 92 percent
300
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

The total RTY is 92 percent. Out of 100 pieces of wood that enter the process,
only 92 acceptable ones come out.
After calculating the RTY, you need to consider the money lost in buying the
other eight pieces of material and the labor lost by working on the material
lost in the third step. Now, consider the impact of a 20- or 30-step process.
How much would you save by improving a process with so many steps?
That’s where Six Sigma comes in.
Consider the example of filling in a home loan application form with 30
blanks. If customers experience a 99-percent success rate for filling in each
blank, you’d calculate the RTY by multiplying 99 percent times itself 30 times.
The result is a 74-percent chance of a customer filling out a form correctly
the first time. Not a very efficient process! Imagine the cost of reworking all
the defective forms to clear up the bad data in the blanks.
Understanding the meaning of “Sigma”
A sigma is a standard deviation on a normal curve — a deviation away from
the mean. In quality terms, it indicates the number of defects that emerge
from a process. The higher the sigma level, the fewer the defects.
Figure 17-2 shows the sigma in a normal curve. You can think of the area
under the curve as all the items produced, or the output. Down the middle is
the mean, or average, value. The figure identifies results as above or below
this average. The closer to the mean a result falls, the more commonly that
value occurs. Some results appear farther from the mean, but those values
should occur very rarely.

Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

Figure 17-2 allows you to put Six Sigma to use in a practical example. Suppose
you’re making wooden yard sticks that hardware stores give away to attract
customers. Looking at the scale on the bottom of Figure 17-2, each yardstick
should be exactly 36 inches long, per customer specifications. You can use
that value for the mean. Based on your stick-making experience, you know
that some will be slightly shorter or slightly longer than the mean. The
normal curve indicates that very few will be a lot longer or shorter; most 
will be very close to the center, or the desired value.
If your customers don’t care that a yardstick is 3⁄10 of an inch longer or shorter
than an exact yard, the process meets customer needs. However, if you’re
creating a tool for measuring cloth for sale, this amount of variation can be
detrimental to your customers, who may have cloth that’s too short, or to 
the seller, who may cut the cloth too long. In this case, the variation of plus
or minus 0.3 inches is unacceptable. In short, the customer determines the
amount of acceptable variation.
You can see numerical breakdowns for a normal curve in Table 17-1. A two-
sigma process (one sigma above and one sigma below the mean) provides
about two-thirds of the results; in other words, two-thirds of a company’s
products or services are free of defects. At four sigma (two sigma on either
side of the mean), defect-free results include over 99 percent of the output.
The higher the sigma you calculate, the better.

Most U.S. companies operate between three and four sigma in quality terms,
and they still spend 20 percent of their costs on correcting defects in com-
pleted products or services. Some companies, like those in the airline indus-
try, operate in areas beyond Six Sigma. They spend a considerable amount of
time and money to ensure that their hugely expensive aircraft remain safe and
operational. A single defect may cost hundreds of lives and millions of dollars.
302
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Measuring variation with x’s and Y’s
Six Sigma focuses on variation in the output caused by variation in the input.
Your input can vary due to different tools, different operators, different mate-
rials, different time of day, and so on (see the section “Measure,” earlier in
this chapter, for more about variation). Whatever the variation may be, after
you identify it, you can measure it.
The equation for measuring variation is as follows:
Y = f(x)
In English, you say, “Y is a function of x.” What values go into this equation?
 Six Sigma uses Y to symbolize the output of a process. Y could be a fin-
ished document, a machined part, or even a properly served customer.
Y is the result of working on the process.
 x is anything you use to complete a task (representing just one step in a
process, or whatever a worker is doing). Y, or the output, is the result of
the x’s that you use to create it (sort of “you are what you eat”).
You can apply this concept to small tasks or to an entire process. On its 
surface, the idea seems basic. It isn’t much different from making soup. The
worker pours inputs (labor, materials, tools, instructions, and so on) into a
process, shakes it up, and something comes out the other end (soup, dirty
pans, heat in the air, and so on). The value of listing everything that goes in
and everything that pops out is identifying what’s involved so a quality team
can focus on where the problem may be.

Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

Any given Y has numerous x’s. To identify and categorize all the x’s, you use 
a Fishbone chart (which we cover later in this chapter). Some x’s are more
significant than others. You may want to list major factors as capital X’s and
minor factors as lowercase x’s. For example, when making soup, the signifi-
cant X’s are the amount of heat applied, water, potatoes, celery, and carrots.
The minor x’s may be the amount of black pepper added.
Putting Everything Together 
with Process-Review Tools
With so much information swirling around the heads of Six Sigma team mem-
bers — from process research, to RTYs, to sigma, to measurements, and the
implementation of Six Sigma — it helps to gather it all into one place for
analysis purposes (a place bigger than your head, of course). Three tools —
SIPOC, Fishbone charts, and FMEA — are easy-to-use and effective for
process analysis. You can use these tools to dissect a process to figure out
what makes it tick.
A classic rule in Six Sigma is, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” If some-
one doesn’t know that something exists, he or she can’t ask questions about
it. A team should never approach a process assuming that the members
know all there is to know about it. You can use the simple tools in the follow-
ing sections to break down processes to methodically study them.
Painting a complete picture with a SIPOC
You can use a Standard Input and Output Chart (SIPOC) (pronounced sigh-
pock) to organize the inputs and outputs of a process onto a single sheet 
of paper. A SIPOC is an excellent tool for beginning the examination of a
process, which we explain in the earlier section “DMAIC: A five-step program,
Six Sigma style.” You can complete the chart with pictures or as text. A
sample SIPOC is shown in Figure 17-3, and the following list outlines its ele-
ments. To create the chart, you just have the following five columns with
space underneath for information.
 Suppliers: Anyone who contributes to making a process work. Some 
categories that suppliers contribute to may be materials, specific labor
skills, tooling, or machines or repair services. In Figure 17-3, the suppli-
ers are a copier company, an office supplies store, and a person making
copies. Focus on the major suppliers to the process; don’t get caught up
in the minutia.
304
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Inputs: The resources necessary to make a process work, such as the
operators or specific materials. In Figure 17-3, the inputs are a copier ser-
vice technician (if needed), a page for copying, blank paper, and toner.
 Process: The process is like the soup pot — it’s where everything 
comes together. In Figure 17-3, the only process is the actual copying 
of a document.
 Outputs: The products that result from the inputs and the workings of a
process. You may list critical product characteristics on this part of the
chart. In Figure 17-3, the outputs are the copies of a document and a
“click” counter. (The click counter is the way the machine keeps track of
how many copies it has made so that workers can replace usage-sensitive
components before they fail.) Listing the critical characteristics of a cor-
rect process output anchors the analysis of customer requirements.
 Customers: The people who receive the value-added product. The cus-
tomers in Figure 17-3 are the person making the copies and folks in other
departments who may receive the copies.
Organizing process inputs 
with Ishikawa’s Fishbone
An easy way to organize the inputs of a process is by using an Ishikawa’s
Fishbone chart (also known as a Cause and Effect Diagram; see Figure 17-4).
Think of the chart as a visual Y = f(x) equation for measurement (see the 
earlier section “Measuring variation with x’s and Y’s” for more about this

formula). The head of the fish is the “Y” of the process, and each of the “ribs”
is an “x” and represents one of the major sources of inputs. This type of dia-
gram is an excellent tool for an in-depth identification of everything that goes
into a process.
To create a Fishbone chart, follow these steps:
1. Draw a horizontal line across the sheet of paper, and draw a box on
the right side of the line.
2. Write the process’s objective in the “head,” such as “Run the kitchen”
(big picture view) or “Make soup” (specific process view).
3. Draw six “fishbones” at an angle toward the left — three lines on top
and three on the bottom, evenly spaced apart (see Figure 17-4).
You’ll fill this space with detail, so use the whole page. You attach a label
to each of these six fishbones. Old-timers use the 6 Ms (men, machines,
materials, money, method, and mother nature). Over time, people have
substituted more politically correct terms like “environment” for
“mother nature” and “people” for “men.”
4. Off each of the fishbones, identify the things the process needs in
order to work properly.
For example, you see the following fishbones in Figure 17-4:
• Men: Anything dealing with the labor used by the process, such as
skilled workers or training.
• Machines: All the tools used in a process, such as a conveyor, a
mop and bucket, and so on.

Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

• Materials: The “things” used in the process. You may identify 
an order form (paper or electronic), a piece of wood, and so on.
Usually, workers use several materials in a process step.
• Money: This could include budget money, petty cash, capital 
purchases, and so on.
• Method: The process steps that fuel the process. Hopefully, the
steps are clearly documented and available to everyone who
works on the process steps. You also include safety requirements,
labor scheduling, and all the actions taken to execute this task.
• Mother Nature: We all work in an environment that directly
impacts performance. Is the work area well lit, dry, and at a com-
fortable temperature? Is the facility sound or falling apart?
Continue breaking down each of the entries attached to the fishbones,
so long as the information is useful. If one of the fishbones becomes too
crowded (called a fishbone becoming a whale bone), break it down as its
own fishbone diagram.
Some flowcharting tools, such as Microsoft’s Visio software, have prebuilt
fishbone diagrams to speed things up.
Pinpointing potential process 
errors with FMEA
Another powerful analytical tool used to scour a process is Failure Modes and
Effects Analysis (FMEA). The tool examines a step within a process for all the
things that can go wrong so you can work to prevent the most pressing
issues. Most FMEA tools are built with spreadsheets, following these steps:
1. Make a list of potential problems for the step.
2. Come up with mitigation actions to avoid the problems.
3. Rank the list of problems and solutions by sorting the “score.”
See the following section “The problem component” for more on the
ranking process.
4. Work on mitigating the highest-scoring issues and adding their solu-
tions into the process to prevent the problems from occurring.
A FMEA isn’t confined only to existing processes. You can use it to improve
the product flow of new processes before their implementation. Furthermore,
a FMEA isn’t a one-shot tool. Always a keep a copy of a process FMEA handy
for the people who use the process. If they detect a problem, the FMEA may
indicate what causes it.
307
Chapter 17: Fixing Tough Problems with Six Sigma

A FMEA is easy to implement, though it often takes a day or more to create.
Your quality team may have a lot to discuss about the process at hand. Some
companies apply FMEAs to every step of every process. Others apply them
only to process steps that cause them the greatest problems. However, given
the amount of time necessary to create a FMEA, Six Sigma practitioners usu-
ally apply one only to a problematic process step.
You should involve everyone who works on a step in the process in a FMEA,
as well as workers from the preceding and follow-up steps in the process. A
team effort works best (see Figure 17-5).
As you can see from the previous list and explanatory info in this section, a
FMEA has two primary components: possible problems within a process and
the proposed mitigation actions for the problems. We describe both parts in
further detail in the following sections.
The problem component
The following items make up the problem component of a FMEA:
 Part/process: The problem part or process step, such as “customer
order entry” or, in the case of Figure 17-5, “office fax machine”
 Failure mode: What caused the problem
 Failure effects: The damage from the problem
 SEV (severity of the error): Ranked on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being 
the worst
 Possible causes: The team lists everything that could’ve caused the
problem
 OCC (occurrence): Ranked on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being most often
 Controls in place: The things used today to mitigate the problem
 DET (detection): How obvious the error is when it occurs, ranked on a 1
to 10 scale, with 10 being the hardest to detect
 Score: The product of severity, multiplied by the occurrence, multiplied
by the detection
You sort the results in descending order to bring the most serious issues
to the top for action and push the least likely and least damaging issues
to the bottom. In the case of Figure 17-5, you’d move the last issue of not
being able to receive faxes to the top for action.
Traditional FMEAs refer to the “Score” field as a Risk Priority 
Number (RPN).

The recommendation component
The following items comprise the recommendation component of a FMEA:
 Solution: Explain the proposed solution (in project management, this is
a mitigation action).
 Assigned to: Person responsible for installing a change.
 Schedule date: When the proposed solution is in place.
 RS: After application of the solution, determine the anticipated severity
of the mitigated problem, using a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst.
 RO: After application of the solution, determine the anticipated frequency
of occurrence of the mitigated problem, using a scale of 1 to 10, with 10
being most often.
 RD: After application of the solution, determine how obvious future errors
will be, using a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the hardest to detect.
 Score: The product of severity, times the frequency, times the detection.
You can compare the results to the earlier score (see the previous sec-
tion) to determine a magnitude of improvement.
 Risk: The risk that your solution will fail. The risk is higher if the solution
is expensive.

Delving into Quality 
Function Deployment
In This Chapter
 Looking at Quality Function Deployment basics
 Building a House of Quality from the ground up
T
he concept of quality can mean different things to different organizations.
To a factory, quality is a problem-free product. To a hotel reservation
center, quality is accurate and timely data. However, you can spot a different
aspect to quality that’s missing from both of these examples. The key to qual-
ity is the value that the customer places on the product, and value is how
well a product’s characteristics fulfill the customer’s needs and wants.
Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a disciplined approach to collecting
the wants and needs of the customer and then translating them into product
or service characteristics. You waste time and money if you create a defect-
free product or service that no one wants. You must design quality (in this
context, customer value) into your product or service from the beginning. In
this chapter, we explain the basics of QFD and give you the full scoop on an
important QFD tool: the House of Quality.
Organizing the Nuts ’n’ Bolts of 
Quality Function Deployment
When you use Quality Function Deployment, you gather information from
potential customers, evaluate it, and convert it into product specifications.
You organize the information in a matrix called the House of Quality. In the
following sections, we introduce this matrix and the pros and cons of QFD.

The QFD matrix
QFD uses a series of matrices to break down customer data further and fur-
ther, starting with the voice of the customer. How many matrices you want to
create for the project is simply a matter of where you want your company to
stop. Matrices are time consuming to construct, so you want to create only
as many as are necessary. In this chapter, we describe only the most founda-
tional layer: the overall House of Quality.
The pros and cons of QFD
QFD is a powerful tool that visually ties customer wants and product character-
istics to individual components and the processes that create them. However,
if a company lacks the patience to go through the process, and if representa-
tives from all departments aren’t participating, then the results will be skewed
and the customer will be dissatisfied.
The pros
Quality Function Deployment can improve the success of your new products
and services and revise existing ones. Pluses of QFD include the following:
 You significantly reduce the risk of introducing products (or services)
that customers don’t want. You base products on data, not guesswork.
 You base tradeoffs between design considerations on data and 
agreement of a cross-functional team.
 You can determine the market position of the product to its 
competitors, based on value to the customer.
 QFD matrices allow you to visualize the issues at hand, and they
increase cross-functional communications between the design team,
production team, marketing department, and so on.
 You can eliminate problems in products long after they hit the market.
The cons
A company applying QFD for the first time must spend considerable upfront
preparation. By its nature, QFD is a cross-functional, team-oriented strategy.
At a minimum, you must train several team members from various depart-
ments (marketing, engineering, production, sales, and so on) before you can
begin the process, which can be difficult to arrange and expensive.
312
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Additional minuses of QFD include the following:
 QFD is time consuming because you have to identify target customers
and collect data.
 The design doesn’t reflect the cost of the changes.
 The relationships between various specifications and requirements are
subjective and easily skewed. Values in the House of Quality are based
on the opinions of the participants. One dominant person can skew pri-
orities as higher or lower, block the labeling of some of the relationships
between tradeoffs, and so on.
 A large House of Quality is incomprehensible. Even a medium-sized
chart with 40 customer requirements and 40 design requirements has
1,600 possible relationships that you have to understand.
If You Build a House of Quality,
Customers Will Come
Quality Function Deployment is as complex and detailed as you and your
organization want to make it. Some charts expand into detailed technical-
design analysis, feasibility, detailed competitor analysis, and so on. The basic
QFD process, as we describe in the following sections, is as follows:
1. Collect information from potential customers that specifies their
wants and needs regarding a new product (or service) or the revision
of an existing product.
You refer to the wants and needs of potential consumers as the voice of
the customer, or VOC. Be sure to include a measure for how important
each want or need is.
2. Compare the customers’ requirements with how well your competitors
meet them.
3. Create design requirements that will fulfill the customers’ requirements.
4. Rate the strength of relationships between the design requirements
and the customer requirements.
5. Identify the tradeoffs between design requirements.
6. Determine technical targets to fulfill customer requirements.
313
Chapter 18: Delving into Quality Function Deployment

You put the information you gather on perceived customer needs, methods of
measuring them, and so on into the rooms of the House of Quality (see Figure
18-1), and you should update the rooms as your product or service evolves.
It may be necessary to create a separate House of Quality for each major
market segment. Different groups of people, such as engineers, clerks, office
workers, physicians, and so on, may use the same product very differently.
Identifying customer requirements
At times, the voice of the customer is long and loud. The customer voices
opinions about your product or service through complaints, service calls,
and warranty returns. You should analyze each communication for ways to
improve your existing product features and delivery. However, for new prod-
ucts, you haven’t yet heard the voice of the customer because you haven’t
created the product or delivered the service.
In the following sections, we explain the differences between customer needs
and wants and show you how to collect data to start your House of Quality.
Chapter 6 has details on gathering information from (and about) customers.

Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Distinguishing between demands and delighters
One of your most important jobs is to question customers about what they
demand in a product or service (the needs) and what would be very nice to
have (the wants). The more thoroughly you question and gather information,
the better your product decisions will be. The following list dives a bit deeper
into customer requirements:
 Expected requirements are customer requirements that you must fill. If
the requirements aren’t present, the product ceases to be of value to the
customers, and they become dissatisfied. For example: A restaurant’s
waiters are expected to be polite. Rude service drives people away.
 Requirements that merely excite the customer may be harder to
uncover. Their presence is exciting, but their absence doesn’t keep the
customer from wanting the product or service. These delighters wow the
customers and add value in their mind. The trick is to question potential
customers about what these features may be and how much they may
value each feature. Often the customers don’t know themselves.
Collecting information to start your House of Quality
Take action by following these steps to collect customer data:
1. Make a list of all potential end-users (or people who will use the item).
If your product is a new company computer network service, for exam-
ple, you could consider the secretary, the boss, the employees, or any
customers that may need to use the network. If your product is a new
broom, you could consider children, handicapped persons, janitors, or
able-bodied persons with either older or no children.
2. Develop a list of questions regarding the product or service. Prepare
questions for each type of user. Consider factors such as the following:
• What skills do the users or clients need to use the product or 
service?
• What would make it more comfortable or easy for consumers?
• What does the customer like about the current product or service?
• What does the customer dislike about the current product or 
service?
• How does the customer typically use the product or service?
• What would the customer change about the product or service?
The best data-collection methods involve personal contact. Interview
potential customers and observe your product or service (or a competi-
tor’s) in use. Organize focus groups to discuss the product. Surveys and
questionnaires help but don’t give as much information.
315
Chapter 18: Delving into Quality Function Deployment

3. Organize the wants and needs of your customers into a list that cate-
gorizes them. You want labels such as “critical to delivery,” “critical to
cost,” and so on. This is the “what” section of the matrix — in other
words, what the customer wants (see Figure 18-2). The left-most column
lists the categories of customer wants and needs, and the second
column contains brief descriptions of the wants or needs.
If the list of wants and needs is more than 20 items, reduce it or break it
down into several smaller lists. Keep your charts to manageable sizes —
especially if you have to present them to executives in your organization.
4. Determine how important each described feature is to the final prod-
uct. Quantify each feature on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being of little impor-
tance and 5 being of high importance. Add each figure to the column
titled “Importance.”
Sometimes a paired comparison is useful for determining relative impor-
tance. Ask prospective customers to compare two features and pick one
as more important than the other. Pair all the features against each other
to determine the relative score of a particular feature’s importance.
5. Ask customers about the same wants and needs as they apply to com-
peting products. If you have a conceptually new product, you may have
to identify several products, where each has one characteristic of the
solution. Again, rate each want and need on a 1 to 5 scale. Be sure to
include any competing products considered to be the “best in class.”
(See the following section for more on the uses of this data).
Poorly conducted data gathering is the primary reason that QFD fails. Some
companies actually believe that they know more than their customers, so
they fill in the information for themselves! If a company lacks a team that 
routinely researches markets, then it should consider using a nonbiased,
third-party organization to gather its customer data.

Listening to the voice of the marketplace
A critical goal of QFD is to create a product or service that provides signifi-
cantly more value than competing models. When surveying products in the
marketplace with prospective customers, focus on published problems with
competing products. Identify the gap between what customers say they want
and what the competitors are delivering. This gap is where you can find your
immediate opportunities.
Along the top of Figure 18-3, list the various competitors you use for compari-
son when gathering customer information (see the previous section). For each
customer want or need, identify how well each competitor meets it on a 1 to 5
scale, with 5 being the best. Compare this column with the “Importance”
column. The result identifies things that your product does well (which
should be protected) and areas in which the product can improve.
You can use benchmarking to help choose among several design concepts
that you’re considering. During the process, consider recombining some
ideas that seemed to have promise but didn’t rank too well with customers.
You may create an even better product as a result.
Converting customer requirements 
into design specifications
After your quality control team gathers a sufficient amount of customer data,
you can begin interpreting it. But what amount is sufficient, though? At some
point, no more new ideas will pop up in your research.

Chapter 18: Delving into Quality Function Deployment

You start your data interpretation by rephrasing each customer observation
about a product into a need for the product (in other words, a design specifi-
cation). Here are some traits of proper needs statements:
 Put the focus on the product. The product should be the subject, 
as opposed to “I” or “the user.” Each need describes something about
the product.
 Be positive. State what the product does do, not what it doesn’t do. 
By being positive, you can actively add a useful feature as opposed to
merely avoiding an undesirable trait.
 Be specific. Describe the product in objectively measurable terms, 
such as the product weighing less than eight ounces.
 Stay functional. State what the product does, not how it does it. For
example: “An MP3 player runs continuously for eight hours” doesn’t
state how the player runs continuously.
 Stay simple. Break down complex statements into individual needs.
Each statement addresses only one function or characteristic. If the
function has two characteristics, then each one is a separate item.
Figure 18-4 is the “how” section of the House of Quality matrix — also known
as the voice of the engineer. You fill it out to indicate which design specifica-
tions apply to each of the customer wants and needs. You list the voice of the
engineer along the top of the matrix.
You may notice that a field called “Direction of Improvement” now appears 
in Figure 18-4. Feel free to ignore it for now; we explain what it means in the
“Targets” section later in this chapter.

Determining relationships between
requirements and specifications
You know that state-of-the-relationship talk most newly formed couples dread?
Well, to move forward in your quality relationship with your customers, you
need to determine the state of the relationship between customer require-
ments and your design specifications. We show you what to do in the follow-
ing sections.
Making sure that you can measure customer requirements
Ensuring that your organization meets each customer need requires an
objective way to measure the needs. The good news is that you can measure
virtually all needs. If the need is for your product to be light in weight, for
example, you can set a metric for the object to weigh less than a specific
number of pounds.
Some metrics require additional thought. If a customer want or need is for
the car you produce to be attractive, for example, talk to a panel of potential
customers and determine what the consensus is for “attractive” (see the ear-
lier section “Identifying customer requirements” for details). Perhaps the
metric will be that 70 percent of the panelists agree that the car is attractive,
or that fewer than 10 percent say they “wouldn’t be caught dead in it.” Some
metrics have a binary value: Either the metric will be true or it won’t. For
example, either an MP3 player is sold with a carrying strap or it isn’t.
Focus on what’s needed to meet customer requirements, not on how to do it.
Take care not to include or infer how to do something in technical specifica-
tions; this hinders the flow of ideas later.
Mapping relationships
In the House of Quality matrix, under the design requirements and to the
right of the customer needs, indicate the relationship you find between 
customer wants or needs and design requirements. You’re filling out the
“what-to-how” section of the matrix (refer to Figure 18-4 to see the area 
we’re talking about).
Not every design requirement you have will relate to a customer need, so
you’ll have to leave many of these blocks blank. (For example, a ground wire
on an electrical device may be required to meet electrical safety codes, but
the customer will rarely ask about it.) But when a specification does apply to
a customer requirement, indicate the relationship as one of the following:
319
Chapter 18: Delving into Quality Function Deployment

 Weak relationship: Indicate this relationship with a “–” symbol and score
it as a “1.” This means that if the specification becomes looser or tighter,
it very slightly changes the performance of the customer requirement.
 Moderate relationship: Indicate this relationship with a “0” and score it
as a “3.” This means that if the specification becomes looser or tighter, it
changes some of the performance of the customer requirement.
 Strong relationship: Indicate this relationship with a “+” symbol and
score it as a “9.” This means that if the specification becomes looser or
tighter, it directly changes the performance of the customer requirement.
You’ll use the numeric scores in the later section “Absolute importance.”
Quality tradition calls for you to use a power of 3 in each relationship cell
that you place a number in. The numbers you use are 1, 3, and 9, which 
correspond to 30, 31, and 32, respectively.
Laying the roof
If we want to keep the drips away, we need a roof for our House of Quality
(see Figure 18-5). The roof is a correlation matrix that illustrates interactions
between technical requirements.
When considering the potential designs of a product, you may find that some
features sacrifice quality in one area to improve it in another. For example,
buying a computer with a relatively large amount of memory will give the
consumer more speed, but it will cost the consumer more money, too. In the
business situation where you must make all products the same, it’s important
to consider how one feature impacts another.
Above the direction-of-improvement indicators (see the “Targets” section 
later in this chapter), you see a matrix at an angle. This matrix shows how one
metric affects another. The easiest way to visualize the roof of the house — in
other words, to look at the relationships between your design specifications —
is to grade the relationships with the following symbols:
 “– –” for a strong negative relationship: If one characteristic is
decreased, the other characteristic is significantly increased. In essence,
they move in opposite directions; one goes up, the other goes down.
 “–” for a negative relationship: If one characteristic is decreased, the
other characteristic is increased.
 “+” for a positive relationship: If one characteristic is decreased, the
other characteristic is decreased. They move in the same direction.
 “++” for a strong positive relationship: If one characteristic is increased,
the other characteristic is significantly increased.
320
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Digging a basement
It isn’t always possible to provide every feature that your customers want or
need in your product (or service). Your job is to determine the difficulty that
comes with developing the product and the relative value of the product by
considering the technical characteristics and customer wants and needs.
In Figure 18-6, we’ve added rows to the bottom of the House of Quality matrix
for you to indicate the relative importance of each specification and a mea-
surable target for each. We cover these rows in the following sections.
Absolute importance
Absolute importance is value you get when you multiply the “Importance”
column with the relationship boxes. The relationships carry symbols (–, 0, or
+) — each of which you equate to a numeric score of 1, 3 or 9, respectively
(see “Mapping relationships,” earlier in this chapter, for details). You multiply
these values by the values in the “Importance” column and put the total into
the “Absolute Importance” box.
Relative importance
You have two possibilities when filling out the “Relative Importance” row:
 You can rank the “Absolute Importance” values from highest (most cru-
cial to your product’s success) to lowest; the highest value(s) gets a 1,
the next highest gets a 2, and so on.
 You can rank by calculating the percentage of each “Absolute Importance”
value in context with the rest of the values. This makes it easier to see
how important each value is relative to the others and relative to the 
project as a whole.

Chapter 18: Delving into Quality Function Deployment

For example, say you have the following five values in the “Absolute
Importance” blanks: 20, 40, 80, 50, and 10. You can rate them from most
important to least important, like so: 4, 3, 1, 2, 5. You could also put 
their importance in percentage form: 10, 20, 40, 25, and 5. (The House of
Quality shown in the figures throughout this chapter has two rows, so you
can use both strategies if you desire.)
The “Relative Importance” row ranks the scores to indicate which area you
should address first, second, and so on.
Targets
Targets specify the required values for each metric. The House of Quality in
Figure 18-6 has two rows next to Targets so that you have room to indicate
both the minimally acceptable and the ideal values. You need to identify a
minimally acceptable target so that your product always meets consumer
expectations. However, most consumers appreciate having their expectations
exceeded; this is more likely to happen when a metric approaches or even
exceeds its ideal value.
You should make a chart that indicates both the optimal value and minimally
acceptable value for each metric. By specifying both values, you allow for
some design leeway. The leeway helps prevent a value from being lowered
too much to attain excellence elsewhere, and it may help find a happy
medium between two metrics that have adverse effects on each other 
(see the section “Laying the roof” for an example).

You normally determine these values in a couple of ways:
 A physical feature: An engineering analysis of the component
 An intangible feature: Based on what customers identified as an optimal
value in their interviews
It may not be practical to indicate a target value for everything. It can be
almost as useful to indicate that “more of this” or “less of this” is better.
Along the top of the matrix, above the design requirements, you see a row of
boxes called “Direction of Improvements.” They indicate whether the value
for a design requirement should increase, decrease, or stay the same with the
following symbols:
 Maximize this value: Indicated with a “↑”
 Minimize this value: Indicated with a “↓”
 Optimal value: Indicated with a “0”
Technical difficulty
The quality team should discuss each technical design specification and
assign numerical values indicating the foreseen difficulty for the organization
to meet the requirements. Rate on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being easy to meet
the requirement and 5 being very difficult (in other words, expensive). Use
the scale to weed out requirements that provide little value at high cost.
The hard part of the technical process is ranking those requirements in 
the middle — requirements that provide moderate value at a slightly higher
cost. These may require additional review in a separate House of Quality that
breaks them down further, or you can hold out for a later version of the prod-
uct, after you gain a better understanding of its manufacture.
Always consider the maturity of the marketplace, technical maturity, busi-
ness risk, supplier capability, and so on when making your product rankings.
Limit the number of high-risk items.

Considering the Theory 
of Constraints
In This Chapter
 Looking at the basics of the Theory of Constraints
 Delving into unique constraint concepts
 Getting rid of constraints in a process
 Putting visual tools to good use
D
r. Eliyahu Goldratt, in his book The Goal (North River Press), proposes
the Theory of Constraints (TOC). The theory views an organization as a
chain of processes. Each chain has a weak link that limits how much it can
produce; this limitation is known as its constraint.
Dr. Goldratt thinks that we’re missing the point. Quality improvement tech-
niques are okay, but they don’t address the big picture. What good is it to
increase the efficiency of one step of the process if it’s already making more
than the process’s bottleneck can handle?
If a company has tried Lean processes, Total Quality Management, or Quality
Function Deployment without the desired results, why not try something dif-
ferent? The Theory of Constraints says that the key to a quality process is the
constraint — the one unplanned place that sets the pace for everything else.
Manage this bottleneck, and the entire process will flow more smoothly. In
this chapter, we cover the fundamentals and unique concepts of the Theory
of Constraints.
Focusing on the Fundamentals 
of the Theory of Constraints
The Theory of Constraints isn’t a typical quality control technique. The TOC
approaches quality control from its own unique angle, whereas other quality

improvement initiatives build on other techniques (Six Sigma is a classic
example of borrowing from everyone; see Chapter 17 for more about this
technique). In the following sections, we explain the basic principles behind
the TOC and its advantages and disadvantages.
Highlighting the principles behind the TOC
The Theory of Constraints is a comprehensive technique for identifying and
managing an organization’s constraints for obtaining maximum output from a
process (or throughput).
The TOC says that a traditional approach of optimizing individual processes
only occasionally helps throughput. For years, companies have spent large
amounts of money to improve their processes. They have eliminated waste,
shrunk inventories, and so on, but these improvements haven’t delivered a
corresponding quantity of savings. The disconnect occurs because the com-
panies focused on speeding up individual processes to become more effi-
cient, often with no overall improvement in throughput.
Why optimize a process to produce a product or deliver a service faster or
more efficiently if its output will just pile up further down the chain next to a
constraint? The key to improving throughput is to manage the constraint that
prevents maximum process throughput.
Much of a company’s internal friction is between departments and processes.
As measurements and improvements are applied to one process at a time —
often confined to the same department — no one is looking at the “touch
points” where products and responsibility move into someone else’s hands.
The TOC has a big-picture approach to quality that encompasses problems
occurring between processes.
In the following sections, we go into more detail on two of the main principles
of the TOC: focusing on throughput and avoiding the overfeeding of a process.
The TOC aims to identify and resolve internal conflicts — often between poli-
cies. You need to make sure that the result of resolved conflicts is a win-win
situation for all involved parties; if you use the TOC to bludgeon processes
and managers, you’ll see it quickly fade away.
Concentrate on throughput upfront
Most companies measure their production or service processes individually.
They look at how efficiently orders are received or how promptly bills are
paid. They encourage managers who oversee their processes to optimize
them through improvement tools, outside advisors, and even cost reductions,
326
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

and give rewards for jobs well done. However, each isolated improvement 
may have a negative effect on another process. Many companies don’t rate
improvement by how much they improve output of the facility to the cus-
tomer; they rate only on how much faster one individual process works, 
and they emphasize only the cost-cutting benefits of improving quality.
The TOC’s global view perceives improving the speed of individual processes
as a waste of time and money. If the accounts-payable process isn’t constrain-
ing the speed of throughput, why spend time and money to improve it?
Although cutting costs provides an immediate bottom-line impact, it can go
only so far in quality improvement. After all, costs can drop only to zero.
Lean (which we cover in Part III), Six Sigma (which we cover in Chapter 17),
and the Theory of Constraints all have different ideas of the nature of waste:
 Lean’s emphasis on process flow stipulates that waste is anything that
doesn’t add value.
 Six Sigma fights waste in the form of variation in a process or its inputs.
 The TOC defines waste as a constraint on a system’s throughput.
The TOC focuses first on increasing income, as its potential is unlimited. (Of
course, income has an upper limit, but how many companies have fully
exploited and dominated their own markets?) Cutting costs is a secondary
priority. The TOC uses throughput, inventory, and operating expense as mea-
sures to guide company decisions:
 Throughput is the rate at which the company’s processes create cash for
the company through sales of its products or services.
 Inventory is an investment in tooling, labor, materials, and any other
items needed to create goods for sale.
 Operating expense is the cash spent to convert inventory into throughput.
The biggest gains from the TOC technique come from increasing throughput.
After that, companies should pay attention first to inventory and last to oper-
ating expense. This hierarchy conflicts with the traditional quality concerns
of first cutting inventory and labor to improve profits.
Don’t overfeed the process!
If you find that a constraint limits the throughput of an important process 
in your organization, it doesn’t make sense for you to improve upstream
processes to run faster. Doing so just creates piles of work-in-process material
at the bottleneck. The TOC refers to this problem as overfeeding the process.
327
Chapter 19: Considering the Theory of Constraints

Implementation of the TOC (combined with Lean; see Part III) reduces the
rate of upstream processes to keep the constraint supplied without piling up
excess work. As you consolidate and then shrink the work-in-process materi-
als, workers can see that the amount of inventory on hand isn’t related to the
facility’s output.
People are funny creatures. If they have jobs like printing paychecks, counting
nails, or whatever, and they can work so fast as to pile up work ahead of a
constraint, they quickly learn to slow down and soak up the time. The maxim
that “work expands to fill the time allotted” is true. What this means for your
organization is that a constraint may not always be obvious if the behavior of
other links in the operating chain disguises it. Look at the entire process from end
to end to identify areas that may be walking slowly — adding non-value-added
steps (see Chapter 12) — to soak up the excess time. This review also brings out
any “near constraints” that you can address.
Weighing the pros and cons of the TOC
The TOC is a breakthrough approach to quality control. If your organization
properly applies it, the TOC can quickly transform your organization by elimi-
nating artificial internal barriers. Think about it: Major improvements to your
bottom line without major capital investment, all because you defeated the
company’s worst enemy — itself! But the TOC isn’t all peaches and cream. We
cover both the pros and cons of the TOC in the following sections.
The pros
The TOC quality improvement technique has many advantages:
 Instead of improving every step of every process within the building, the
TOC focuses improvement efforts (in other words, expense) on those
places where it can provide the greatest benefits. This strategy provides
greater return for the process-improvement dollar. For example:
• If a single manager must approve every customer order, what hap-
pens if the manager gets sick? Why let orders pile up in front of one
person when order entry software can accomplish the same review?
• If the entire cleaning crew shares a single floor buffer, providing a
second buffer may finish jobs quicker and permit the crew to move
on to other places.
 The TOC is similar to Lean in that it minimizes inventory (see Part III for
more about Lean). So how does this minimization save money?
Inventory costs money to purchase and hold until it’s finally included in
a finished product. This ties up money in things that may sit around half
finished for months. The company must pay for floor space to store
everything and for someone to shuffle it around. And this material loses
value through corrosion, theft, damage, humidity, and so on.
328
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 The TOC is similar to Six Sigma (see Chapter 17) in its breakthrough
improvements. While some techniques value small, everyday improve-
ments that eventually add up to big money, the TOC believes that by
breaking up a constraint, you can immediately realize a significant
improvement. Consider emptying a big tub of water: You can leave it in
the sun to evaporate, or you can pull the plug and drain it in no time.
 The TOC saves money in critical areas:
• Eliminates unnecessary internal constraints that only add wasted
work to a process
• Shrinks work-in-process inventory into a few buffers focused on
the constraint
• Improves customer response time through reduced work in a
process
• Frees employee time to improve quality and eliminate constraints
 Policies and measurements are management’s way to signal work priori-
ties to employees; if you focus your policies and measurements on
breaking down constraints, so will your workforce.
Make the identification and elimination of throughput constraints an
important part of every company meeting. Each discussion should begin
with identifying the current constraint and ensuring that previously dis-
cussed constraints remain fixed. By following this strategy, you ensure that
the entire organization is focused on managing work product throughput.
 With the TOC, participants understand how much the junction points
between processes and departments contribute to product or service
delivery. You must constantly manage these interface points to ensure
their normal variability doesn’t disturb overall process throughput.
The cons
One hurdle that comes with using the TOC is manager and worker accep-
tance. The hard part is setting aside all the previously accepted performance
measures and quality initiatives to look at processes in a different light. Until
now in your organization, each process was in contention with the others
through internal optimization of the chain, but the TOC’s view is system-wide
(see the earlier section “Highlighting the principles behind the TOC”).
For example, imagine two departments where the first one feeds the second
one. Each department manager’s promotions and pay raises are based on effi-
cient operations. So Operation A saves everything they make for an entire
week and then sends it over to Operation B. In this way, Operation A pays for
a single shipment. Meanwhile, Operation B (which has limited floor space) is
overwhelmed with material and shuffles it here and there to keep it out of the
way, or late in the week, it’s starved for material with people sitting around.
Operation A’s manager is viewed as efficient, while Operation B’s manager is
seen as ineffective.
329
Chapter 19: Considering the Theory of Constraints

The solution is to make a single person responsible for each product from
end to end and to reward everyone in the chain the same way. Align the
incentives with the desired behaviors.
Other disadvantages of the TOC include the following:
 It may be hard for some department managers to let go of the policies
and measurements that have big parts of their daily routines.
 The key people implementing the TOC must be trained, and a TOC
expert needs to be on site to help roll out this new way of thinking (see
Chapter 5 for general information on training employees).
 An existing reward system in your organization may be locally focused
and will resist your attempts to act globally with the TOC. During the
TOC rollout, expect internal political turbulence as you discard the
assumptions used to build careers or to create personal empires within
your organization.
TOC may not fit everywhere. “Old” companies with strongly entrenched
cliques and heavily negotiated work rules may not have the will to break
down their barriers. (But we would bet that such companies would reap huge
benefits if they did.)
Understanding the Drum-
Buffer-Rope System
An efficient process works at its maximum rate, based on its tools, materials,
labor, and process work instructions. The Drum-Buffer-Rope system is a simple
way to illustrate how a constraint controls the speed at which a process can
work. Managing a process using the Drum-Buffer-Rope system focuses atten-
tion where it belongs: on the process’s bottlenecking constraint.
The following sections go into detail on each part of the system; see Figure
19-1 for an outline of how the Drum-Buffer-Rope system works.
Marching to the beat of the drum
A constraint in your process sets the maximum speed that the process can
achieve and maintain acceptable quality. The pace or the person who con-
trols it is called the drum. Somewhat similar to Takt Time in a Lean operation
(see Chapter 11 for more about Takt Time), the drum sets the beat for the
upstream processes. As you improve the constraint’s throughput, the drum
beats faster for the upstream processes to pick up the pace.
330
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

A good example of a constraint is a bathtub drain. Water can exit the bathtub
only as fast as the drain can handle it — no faster. Shout, threaten, dish out
incentives — no matter what — the draining process moves only as fast as the
drain can take water. The drain sets the rate at which work (draining the
water) is done; it’s the drumbeat of the process. Water in excess of the drain’s
capacity backs up in the tub until it’s drained. If water is added faster than the
drain can let it out, eventually the tub overflows.
Processes work the same way. Work flows along until it hits the constraint. If
the processes feeding the constraint can produce faster than the constraint
can process it, then work backs up. This backed-up work means that the
workers in the processes feeding the constraint have nothing to do until the
backlog is emptied — or they continue piling up even more work-in-process
inventory.
To eliminate inefficiency, the constraint must set the work rate for processes
that feed it. Think of the process from end to end rather than as islands of
work that provide output, whether or not it’s needed.
Managing buffers for maximum results
To maximize a constraint’s capabilities, you need to make sure that the
upstream processes keep it supplied with whatever it needs to keep running.
The constraint should never run out of material. What you do is maintain a
buffer of incoming materials next to the constraint to keep it busy. If the
inflow of new work material slackens, the constraint remains running at full
rate by dipping into the buffer (or safety) stock.

Chapter 19: Considering the Theory of Constraints

For example, consider a doctor’s office. The doctor requires at least five min-
utes with each patient. If more time is needed, the waiting room begins to fill
up. If someone cancels an appointment that day, the doctor would be idle
and miss the income for a patient. One of the waiting patients is used to fill
the time gap. In this way, the doctor’s time is maximized. To ensure that the
doctor is always busy, the office builds a buffer by booking one more patient
per hour than the doctor can see. This action builds a buffer to ensure the
constraint (the doctor) is always fed with work.
A buffer stabilizes the constraint’s performance by isolating it from upstream
problems. Buffer management includes several functions:
 Minimizing the number of buffers in the operating chain to one next
to the constraint and a few more along the chain. The rates of all sub-
processes that feed into the constraint are set so that they provide only
enough to feed the constraint and no more. By minimizing, you gather
the safety time from the individual processes and may reveal other con-
straints. This minimization also reduces the amount of work-in-process
material clogging the facility.
 Setting the minimal size of the buffer. To reduce cost, you need to keep
the work in process at a minimum. A minimal amount of work also pro-
vides flexibility to quickly respond to new customer requirements or
urgent requests.
 Analyzing the causes of buffer shortages that may shut down the con-
straint. Whenever the constraint dips into the buffer, it gives a signal
that the upstream processes have a problem that you must address.
Stabilizing upstream processes allows the buffer to shrink.
Lean techniques (see Part III) reduce materials throughout the facility to
expose problems to address. The TOC seeks out the problems (constraints)
and resolves them before reducing materials. Both processes reduce materi-
als to save money and improve flexibility — it’s just a matter of timing.
Feeding a constraint with the rope
A TOC rope is the length of the operating chain that feeds the constraint. It
stretches from the receiving dock all the way to the constraint. The operating
processes that your material passes through on its way to your customers
are known as the constraint’s subordinate processes.
For example, consider supplying a restaurant kitchen. The “rope” refers to
the actions and materials required to keep the kitchen supplied with fresh
vegetables. The first step was to purchase the vegetables. Then they were
unloaded and inspected. Next they were washed. Finally, they were cleaned
and set aside for that day’s use.
332
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Altogether, this series of steps is considered the “rope” for supplying the 
constraint: the speed of the chef. The rope must ensure that there is enough
material to keep the chef busy but not too much, because the vegetables will
become old and tasteless.
This setup is contrary to the notion that every step of the process must
always be fully busy or time is wasted. Instead of employees involved in the
steps working full time, which only piles up material feeding into the chef,
they should complete only what the chef can use, and then apply their time
to other efforts.
Tackling Constraints in Your Process
Like all change, the Theory of Constraints is best tackled with a team of work-
ers. Conscript one person from each process along the entire chain to pro-
vide explanations about why things are done a certain way and define the
impact of proposed changes. Then follow these steps:
1. Clearly identify the organization’s goals. Your goals are your anchors
for all TOC activities. Typical goals are to be the low-cost provider of a
service, to provide the highest-quality goods, to always have products
on the shelf and ready to sell, and so on. These goals add up to making 
a profit so that your company can grow or at least keep operating.
Not all organizations have a primary goal of increased profits. A hospi-
tal’s primary goal may be perfect patient care; a university may value
providing a top education; and a charity’s main concern may be provid-
ing prompt, effective service. However, on examination, all these organi-
zations need efficient, low-cost operations to achieve their goals.
2. Identify how to measure the goals. The way that you measure a process
signals to the workers what’s important to your company. If a goal is to
make a profit, you must decide whether to measure in revenue or profit.
If the goal is customer satisfaction, you may measure return visits, posi-
tive survey responses, reduced complaints, and so on. A process lacking
meaningful measurements creates its own, which reflect someone else’s
priorities.
So, you have your company goals and a way to measure them. Just what’s
keeping your company from advancing to its goals? Somewhere in the bowels
of your production or service processes lies a constraint. The TOC seeks out
the constraint and eliminates it by using a five-step process; we cover the
steps in the following sections.
333
Chapter 19: Considering the Theory of Constraints

Identifying a process constraint
A system constraint is a weak link in your production chain that makes every
other phase wait. It acts as the throttle on how fast material can flow through
your processes. Constraints can be located in one of three places:
 Internal: You can’t make more to sell due to shortages in capacity, labor
skills, and the like. Inside your organization is the place to begin tackling
constraints.
 Market: You can make and provide more to sell, but the customers don’t
want more. This is true of many companies. Address market constraints
after cleaning up the company’s internal constraints.
 Supplier: You can make and sell more but cannot obtain materials per-
ceived to be critical to your processes. This constraint isn’t common.
Address it by redesigning the product or service to use more common
materials and by eliminating work-in-process inventories.
Maintain excellent relationships with the suppliers (see Chapter 3 for
details on accomplishing this task), and concentrate on new versions that
provide the most money for the least amount of constrained material.
Constraints can come in many forms:
 Control-hungry managers who must review and approve all documents
that come across their desks, even if the documents must wait until they
return from vacation
 An expensive machine that every product must pass through
 Legal requirements, such as the maximum-emission limit for 
air-quality control
 Labor rules that restrict what workers can do on a job
Each of these constraints could limit the speed of a process. However, you can
overcome each of these constraints if the company focuses on minimizing or
eliminating them. So, how exactly do you find and identify a constraint?
 Internal constraints are often found near the end of a process where
they aren’t as obvious. A visible indicator is work in process piled up 
in front of a process but not after it.
 Market constraints can be identified by the ability to inform potential
customers about the product and to deliver it to them. Some companies
have overcome this constraint by building Internet Web sites and ship-
ping anywhere in the world.
334
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

 Supplier constraints can be identified through consistently late or 
canceled shipments. If suppliers have few competitors, they may not 
be able to expand their output further. For example, consider a fiber-
glass molding operation that makes very large truck hoods. If no one
else can make the hoods, the operation can deliver as it wishes.
Some companies use Rapid Improvement (or Kaizen) events to target 
constraints for improved throughput. See Chapter 14 for details about 
these events.
Cleaning up the constraint
The first step in cleaning up a constraint is to take control of the constraining
process task. Establish a schedule in order to set an expectation for the
amount of throughput required by a process, and take care not to overload it.
This schedule becomes the published drumbeat for the upstream processes
to support (see the section “Marching to the beat of the drum,” earlier in this
chapter, for more details). The schedule tells everyone how fast they must
produce to keep the constraint fully “fed.” After they meet this requirement,
they should be assigned to do something else.
By combining the TOC with the 5S Technique (see Chapter 13 for details),
you can clean up a constraint you’ve identified to ensure that it operates at
its maximum potential. The cleanup process includes the following tasks:
 Minimize setup time. For example, how long does it take to gather all
the tools, materials, and information to begin working on a task? For a
restaurant, this task may mean prepackaging ingredients for popular
dishes in “kits” rather than searching for each item.
 Attack downtime, remembering that care of the constraint is your first
priority. A restaurant keeps its cooking equipment in peak working con-
dition by cleaning and adjusting it during off hours.
 Inspect material before it gets to the constraint to ensure only good
material goes in. Bad ingredients delay cooking because someone must
scurry around and find replacement items. Inspect everything early to
ensure that the constraint (the chef) isn’t delayed due to bad material.
 Closely manage the constraint for maximum throughput. Ensure that
the chef isn’t distracted by other tasks such as taking out the trash,
chopping celery, and so on. Focus the constraint on the things that only
the chef can do.
 Implement predictive maintenance on the constraint’s equipment,
where you replace parts before they wear out. Parts (like cooking
equipment) are replaced according to a schedule rather than waiting 
for them to fail.
335
Chapter 19: Considering the Theory of Constraints

After the process’s clutter is cleaned up, verify that it’s still a constraint.
Often, applying attention to a work area speeds up the flow of material
through it. If the improvement can now handle everything required of it,
there is time to spare, and the constraint has moved.
Subordinating processes to 
keep materials moving
The cleaned-up constrained process now sets the pace for processes
upstream and downstream of its location, acting as the drumbeat for 
your operation. The TOC calls this action subordinating the feeding
processes. This third step is where most of the behavior change occurs 
in the constraint.
Subordinating other processes to the drum — the pace set by the con-
strained process — frees time for other things:
 You must make sure processes upstream perform at full speed until the
buffer fills up and then shuts down. Use the extra time for maintenance
and for inspecting goods in the buffer to ensure that only perfect parts
enter the constraint. (See “Managing buffers for maximum results,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for more about buffers.) The intent is to avoid having
workers make more material than is needed by the constraint, and to
avoid having them stretching out the work to fill the extra time. Capture
this time and use it elsewhere.
 You must make sure that processes downstream from the constraint
work carefully so their actions don’t damage any material already past
the constraint; these pieces are too precious to waste. For instance:
After a chef passes a completed plate of food to the pickup point, ensure
that nothing there will spoil it, like a waiter knocking it over.
 Where possible, subordinate processes take on steps previously done
by the constraint, saving the amount of work the constraint performs
(and time taken up by the constraint). Consider moving low-value work
(things that can be done outside of the constraint) back to the supplying
processes. For example, require a dishwasher to ensure that the chef
always has a pile of clean plates ready to use instead of requiring the
chef to ask for more.
336
Part IV: Surveying Other Quality Control Techniques 

Elevating the constraint
Time to spend some money! The fourth step calls for you to elevate the 
constraint — in other words, to improve its capacity. You can elevate the 
constraint in many ways:
 Buy additional machinery or expansions to the existing machinery.
 Hire or train additional employees for improved utilization or extra 
work shifts.
 Implement a quick changeover process for swapping the constraint. If
the constrained process performs different tasks, it’s easier to change.
 Improve tooling for faster changeover and longer tool life.
So here we are. The constraint was identified and cleaned up so that it can
focus on its primary purpose, every process that fed it was scheduled to
meet the constraint’s requirements without overfeeding it, and at the end, 
the constraint was expanded so it could process all that was needed. You
fixed the constraint! So now what?
337
Chapter 19: Considering the Theory of Constraints
This is the true story of a constraint 
in the real world
An everyday constraint people encounter is the
number of checkout lines at the local grocery
store. On a Friday night or Saturday morning, the
lines are long. At times, shoppers walk out of the
store without buying anything because they
don’t want to wait in slow-moving lines that
constantly call for “price checks.” In the case
of the grocery store, its sluggish checkout lines
constrain the store’s payoff for stocking the
shelves, providing an attractive venue, and
incurring advertising expense.
How have some grocery stores tackled this
constraint?
 Some stores give up floor space that they
could be using for merchandise to add
checkout lines that they staff during peak
shopping periods. This tactic helps, but walk-
ing around to find a short line can take as
long as waiting in a long, slow-moving line.
 Some stores have express checkout lanes
that limit the number of items allowed per
person.
 Some stores install self-service checkout
lanes for people with only a few items so
they can move quickly. This also saves on
labor during peak periods.
 Some stores spin off home-delivery compa-
nies that take orders over the Internet and
eliminate the checkout line all together. (If
possible, you should strive to eliminate a
constraint completely!)

Improving throughput all over again
Applying the Theory of Constraints to your quality program is a continuous
process. Sometimes breaking down internal barriers to maximum throughput
is difficult, but you should never let inertia become your next system con-
straint! Solving one problem only reveals the next one. Somewhere, you have
another constraint lurking, waiting for its chance to take hold of your
processes.
Do several of your subordinated processes have similar capabilities? If their
throughput is about the same as the constraint you just addressed and elimi-
nated, the subordinated processes may be the next targets. Although the con-
straint you identify should be your prime effort, sometimes improving “near
constraints” moves them down the list.

Quality into a New Product

 Noting customer needs and critical product features
 Creating a capable, mistake-proof process with a ready-to-go supply chain
 Testing and improving a new process
 Establishing a feedback process
P
rocesses exist in order to create. A process may produce a service or a
physical item, but you can refer to both as “products.” A high-quality
process is one that creates what the customer wants. The customer could be
an employee in the next workstation or a consumer driving an SUV.
High-quality products don’t hit the shelves by accident. They begin with well-
designed processes; the right materials and tools; and trained, motivated
workers. Introducing a new product can be exciting, and stuffing the right
ingredients into a new process is essential to squeezing good results out of it.
Delivering high-quality new products is essential because first impressions
become lasting impressions. Most companies focus on delivering well-made
products first and then on delivering them as cheaply as possible, without
sacrificing quality. With careful design, your organization can achieve both
objectives at once. In this chapter, we describe ten important steps you can
take to ensure that you inject quality into a new product from the get-go.

Identify a Problem You Can Solve 
with a New Product or Service
Products and services exist to fulfill a customer need or to solve a problem.
Therefore, the first step in product development is to identify a problem you
can solve. You can make the identification through many channels:
 Customer surveys
 Analysis of service complaints
 Examination of emerging technology
 A look at shifts in trends
When identifying a problem to solve with a new product or service, consider
customer requirements. These requirements break down into three types of
attributes: Must Haves, Satisfiers, and Performance attributes (see Chapter 6
for details).
The key is to craft a product or service and a production process with fea-
tures that meet the customer requirements while aligning with your com-
pany’s strengths and strategic direction.
Define the Critical Characteristics 
of Each Customer Requirement
You must further identify each customer requirement you deem important by
its characteristics. For instance, if the customer requirement is for an “inter-
esting” Web page, what does that mean? You should further describe the cus-
tomer requirement in three primary critical-to-customer categories (see
Chapter 6 for details): quality, price, and delivery.
Document and protect the critical features you identify, even when changes
occur down the line in a process. For instance, to increase production
speeds, a company must make tradeoffs. When in doubt, always choose the
option that protects a critical-to-customer characteristic. Document each
decision you make in case the same option is proposed later.
An excellent tool for identifying and tracking customer requirements is a
Quality Function Deployment model (see Chapter 18). It allows you to match
customer requirements to process actions, and it can prioritize your list of
critical-to-customer characteristics.
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Translate Customer Requirements 
into Measurements
A customer’s desire for a “durable” item can mean many things, and your
organization needs to find out what your customers are thinking. Make a
product too durable and money is wasted on excess materials; make it too
fragile and you lose customers. You need to assign a measurement (or series
of measurements) to each customer characteristic so all workers know how
much of something your customers desire. In other words, you translate criti-
cal-to-quality requirements into critical-to-process actions.
During production, your workers can sample customer characteristics and
measurements. Quality may slip a tiny bit at a time, but always in the direc-
tion of making things easier for a worker or toward the use of cheaper materi-
als. By monitoring measurable results, you can detect and stop trends and
detect unapproved changes to a process.
Establish a Capable Prototype Process
Set up a prototype version of the process your organization will use to create
the product, and verify that the tools, materials, and workers involved are
capable of creating the product. Sometimes, machinery must be upgraded to
hold tight tolerances. The materials selected may be too fragile and generate
high scrap rates. The font on a data-entry screen may be too small to read, or
the database query may take far too long. The more similar to the final prod-
uct the prototype is, the more accurate the prototype results will be.
A useful tool for designing and improving processes is a Failure Modes and
Effects Analysis (FMEA). This tool (which we cover in Chapter 17) examines
everything that can go wrong with a process so that you can build steps into
the process to avoid many of the potential problems.
Make Your Process Lean
After you design and test your potential process (see the previous section),
draw a Value Stream Map to illustrate the flow of work through the steps (see
Chapter 12 for details on this map). Look for possible areas of waste built
into the process. Ensure that the product travels the minimum distance, and
requires the fewest steps, to go from raw material to finished item. This step
reduces work-in-process goods and waste from excessive handling.
343
Chapter 20: Ten Steps for Incorporating Quality into a New Product or Process

Leaning a process gives you a great opportunity to engage the workers who
will create the product. Gaining their insight can improve the process while
increasing their ownership of the results. After you make the process as Lean
as it can get, update the FMEA (see the previous section) to identify any new
problems that have popped up. Part III has more about Lean processes.
Mistake Proof Your Process
A mistake-proof process eases the difficulty of assembly by fitting together
only one way. The form can range from two parts whose shapes fit only one
way to a data-entry form that uses a drop-down list of states to ensure that
only valid data can be entered. You can even provide kits to assemblers that
identify the correct number of each type of part; if any parts remain in a kit
after assembly, the work product is missing a part.
Another mistake proofing approach is to detect a problem before it leaves the
workstation. For example, a worker can fit the finished item into a fixture to
ensure that it’s the right size. You could also include a scale to weigh the
work product to ensure that everything is inside of it.
Examine the process using your previously created FMEA (see the section
“Establish a Capable Prototype Process”) to identify areas for mistake proofing.
Prepare the Kanban
Kanban (see Chapter 15) is a plan for material flow, such as materials taken
from the receiving dock to the assembly line. Kanban planning ties the use of
an item to its resupply without piling up material in the intermediate steps.
Here are some steps for undertaking the Kanban process:
1. Determine how you’ll order materials and deliver them to fabrication
or assembly points.
2. Identify the appropriate quantity per container for each item.
3. Integrate the parts into the existing replenishment process.
Be sure the process reaches all the way back to where the component is
ordered from the supplier.
4. Lay out the workstation so that you present components to your work-
ers in a logical order.
Heavy items may require additional material-handling units.
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Test the Process
Enough with all the preparatory work; it’s time to run the process. You
should measure the critical-to-quality points to ensure that they’re repeat-
able, given any of the machinery, workers, or materials that become part of
the process. After you have the process running at full speed, begin tracking
results with run charts and Statistical Process Control (see Chapter 10 for
details). The test will demonstrate the process’s capability, which you can
compare to its designed capability.
A few process teams are so perfect that they can get every detail right the
very first time — and then there is reality. At this point, the process works,
but can you make it more efficient? Gather your process-creation team to
review the FMEA charts for possible changes and spots to improve (see the
section “Establish a Capable Prototype Process”). Sometimes, the FMEA indi-
cates a symptom and a cause of a problem for which you can’t add a preven-
tative action to the process. If the symptom and cause occur, the FMEA
quickly points back to the origin.
Incorporate Improvements 
into the Process Design
When a process is fully functional, opportunities for improving it will appear.
Some improvement opportunities involve the following components:
 Performance: Make the process complete its tasks more efficiently by
eliminating built-in delays, rebalancing work among various steps, or
using different tools.
 Delivery: Make modifications to provide a product or service to the cus-
tomer more quickly. Examples include quick responses to orders for spe-
cial colors or providing tracking information for a shipped package.
 Cost: You can suggest the use of different materials or suppliers.
The process designers must always look for ways to improve each process
step. You can hold meetings of everyone involved with the process to cri-
tique the process and make suggestions for improvement. Many suggestions
will be for small changes, but collectively they can make a big difference.
Keep the original process design documents (FMEA, Value Stream Map, and
so on) up to date with any changes to the process. As time passes and memo-
ries fade, these documents provide a snapshot of the process creation team’s
ideas at a given time.

Chapter 20: Ten Steps for Incorporating Quality into a New Product or Process

Create a Customer-Feedback Mechanism
Feedback is nature’s way of telling you how your process is working. Before
making a process fully operational to produce items or services for the cus-
tomer, create a feedback mechanism to gather information for quick action.
Feedback can include
 Service desk calls
 Product returns
 Inspection rejections
 Customer complaints of any type
 Customer satisfaction surveys
And so on. Be sure the feedback immediately goes to your process team for
prompt consideration. (See Chapter 6 for more information on gathering feed-
back from customers.)
To reduce the number of problems at the initial rollout of new processes,
many companies “test market” their products in one area for a short time to
gather customer opinions. The companies use the opinions to update the
products before rolling them out to their target markets.

Chapter 21
Ten (Or So) Web Sites with Quality
Control Tips and Techniques
In This Chapter
 Finding quality control help on the Internet
 Linking to consulting organizations
T
he Internet is a wonderful tool. In just a few moments, you can find infor-
mation on a wide range of subjects and locate links to others. Some gen-
eral sites, such as Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com), can provide a quick
overview of most quality control subjects. In this chapter, we give you a
handful of Web sites that are chock-full of useful quality knowledge.
You can often find additional information on the Web sites of companies that
are trying to sell their services or products. Companies often use white
papers, copies of presentations, and general tutorials to introduce their ser-
vices. When researching topics for your organization, look for these as valu-
able “second points of view” on the same issues.
International Organization 
for Standardization
The official Web site for the International Organization for Standardization,
www.iso.org, is the authoritative source of ISO information. It contains
information on various ISO standards and news about ISO as well as basics
about the ISO process. Like all self-respecting businesses, it also offers many
documents you can purchase for download. See Chapter 2 for ISO details.

American Society for Quality
The American Society for Quality provides information, training, and certifi-
cation in a wide range of quality techniques. The Web site has some excellent
information on the basics of quality management and a list of training oppor-
tunities. However, to view most of the material on the site, you must become
a member. Check out www.ASQ.org for info, and see Chapter 2 for more
information about ASQ.
Lean Aerospace Initiative
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has a Web site containing infor-
mation about Lean techniques, including some success stories that illustrate
ways you can apply Lean techniques in your organization. You can download
interesting documents that explain Lean concepts, and links to other univer-
sities offer Lean training (maybe a training session is near you). Head to
lean.mit.edu. Chapter 11 has general info about Lean techniques.
Curious Cat Management 
Improvement Library
The Web site for Curious Cat Management Improvement Connections con-
tains a series of articles illustrating Lean thinking and Lean manufacturing. It
features a directory of Web sites containing additional information. The site,
at www.curiouscat.net/library/leanthinking.cfm, provides a broad
range of perspectives of Lean and how various industries have applied it. It
also has links to other Web sites that discuss Lean thinking.
The Northwest Lean Networks
The most informative site for Value Stream Mapping that we can find is a PDF
file that steps through the Value Stream process: www.nwlean.net/toolsCD/
VSM/4%20steps%20to%20VSM.pdf. Head to Chapter 12 for more about
Value Stream Mapping.
348
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Kaizen Institute
Kaizen is an “imported” quality concept that enjoys support from a number of
organizations. One of the many Kaizen Web sites is www.kaizen-institute.
com. See Chapter 14 for more about Kaizen (also called Rapid Improvement
Events [RIEs]).
Replenishment Technology Group Inc.
You can find many companies that sell Kanban consulting and its “tools.” One
interesting commercial site is www.kanban.us. We cover Kanban in detail in
Chapter 15.
Total Quality Management
One interesting Web site with many articles about applying Total Quality
Management (TQM) and links to other sites is www.managementhelp.org/
quality/tqm/tqm.htm.
Two other significant sites for TQM are run by organizations founded by two
of TQM’s major contributors:
 The Juran Institute’s site, www.juran.com
 The W. Edwards Deming Institute’s site, www.deming.org
Chapter 16 has the full scoop on TQM.
i Six Sigma
You can think of Six Sigma as a toolbox of quality initiatives glued together 
by statistics. Therefore, a Web site that provides detailed Six Sigma support
also provides information on a wide range of quality tools. A good Web site
for information on Six Sigma and on a wide range of other quality tools is
www.isixsigma.com. Chapter 17 has details on Six Sigma.
349
Chapter 21: Ten (Or So) Web Sites with Quality Control Tips and Techniques

QFD Institute
The QFD Institute is the official Quality Function Deployment Web site. The
site contains useful information on Quality Function Deployment as well as
training. Head to www.qfdi.org, and see Chapter 18 for more about QFD.
AGI
AGI (the Avraham Y. Goldratt Institute) is the authoritative source for informa-
tion on the Theory of Constraints. After all, Mr. Goldratt wrote the book on the
TOC! The AGI Web site contains information about the Theory of Constraints
and how a wide range of enterprises has successfully applied it. Check out
www.goldratt.com, and head to Chapter 19 for an overview of the Theory
of Constraints.
