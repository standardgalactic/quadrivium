CREATE A TOWN GARDEN AND
PATIO 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
With careful planting and design, you can transform even the 
tiniest of town plots into a delightful garden.  
  
In gardening, small really is beautiful! Limited space means 
that you can garden as intensively as you like without devoting 
hours of your leisure time to such chores as weeding. 
  
Even if you plan to garden on a tight budget, the small 
dimensions will allow you to develop the most attractive 
planting schemes without breaking the bank. Every plant you 
select can be of the very best - because you will need so few - 
and if you take care with your design, you will be amazed at 
what superb results you can achieve. 
  
Even if the plot runs to no more than a few square metres it will
still have potential for a charming and stylish garden.  
  
 
2  -  Planning the work  

 
Even though the dimensions are small, incorporate an open, 
preferably paved, area where seating or dining furniture is 
installed. Avoid overcrowding this area with too much 
garden furniture, but be ready to furnish it with plenty of 
attractive plants in containers.  
 
 
 
Create an illusion of space  
Blind arches, screens which suggest more behind - even 
when there isn't - a vista with an object at its end and criss-
crossing paths.  
 
 
 
Make your garden look larger  
By adjusting perspective you can make your lawn or paved 
area wider at the front than at the back. This will have the 
effect of pushing the horizon further away. Accentuate this 
distortion by placing tall plants or objects on either side, 
running down to shorter ones at the centre.  
 
 
 
Include a secret garden  
If there's room, make your garden harbour exciting secrets: 
a little arbour, concealed behind a screen; a tiny half 
concealed pool; an old statue lost among the foliage.  
 
 
 
Think of the scale  
Your design can be as grand as you like, but remember to 
scale everything down to the size of your garden. Large 
trees or huge containers may not be practicable, but one or 
two prominent features, making a bold statement, are likely 
to be more effective than masses of small, fussy ones.  
 
 
 
Ring the changes  
In a tiny garden, it is easy and inexpensive to make major 
changes. Use this facility as often as you like, mixing and 
matching plants as well as altering the main elements of 
your design. 
 
 
 
Balance your plants  
Planting can be as dense as you like - crowded, even - but 
take care to banish thuggish varieties that smother their 
neighbours. Think of scale, when planting, and avoid 
outlandish sized plants unless you wish to make an 
especially bold statement.  
 
 
 
A large mirror, carefully placed, will give the impression of a 
larger garden. To make this trick work, have the mirror 
partially concealed, or at least fixed so that its edges are not 
obvious.  
 
3  - Planting principles  

Plants that fail to provide good foliage, flower, fruit or 
outline must be rejected. Select only the best varieties and 
be ruthless in discarding anything that fails to perform.  
 
 
 
Try to give an impression of lushness and verdure. Select 
some plants purely for their foliage, even if they seem too 
large for the site. The evergreen Aucuba can help, especially 
if your garden is partly shaded. Its big leaves would make a 
fine contrast with the tiny leaflets of honeysuckle (Lonicera 
nitida 'Baggesen's Gold'). For spring, consider Spiraea 
'Goldflame' for its unique orange foliage, and contrast it with 
the blue-green grass, blue fescue (Festuca glauca).  
 
 
 
Remember that the aim is for year-round interest. Ensure 
that you select something for every season and include 
bulbs, alpines, plants to squeeze between paving slabs, 
speedy annuals and biennials.  
 
 
 
You don't have to own a tiny garden to take advantage of 
these ideas. Even if you own a larger outdoor area, you can 
still apply these principles to your patio, to a small terrace, 
or perhaps an outdoor seating area.  
 
 
 
4  - Planting the bones  
Your design may well include such structures as steps, walls,
trellis, banks and terraced levels. You can also create a 
sense of structure using plants, either formally as clipped 
hedges, or informally, purely for their outline.  
 
 
 
Box  
(Buxus sempervirens) Makes one of the best 'shaping' 
materials for a small garden because it is easy to keep to 
size. You can use it as hedging material, as single plants 
clipped into particular shapes, or even allow it to grow as a 
small, free-standing tree. A single annual trim, in 
midsummer, will keep it to the desired dimensions. 
Alternative evergreens include yew (Taxus), holly (Ilex), 
privet (Ligustrum) and hedging honeysuckle (Lonicera 
nitida).  
 
 
 
Topiary  
If you want to clip evergreens into specific shapes, use a 
frame or a mould made of wire netting and encourage the 
plants to grow through the shape you have made. Each 
year, trim the plants back to the desired shape.  
 
 
 
Shrubs  
When creating informal outline or structure, remember that 
certain shrubs will provide a distinctive winter and summer 
outline. The corkscrew hazel (Corylus avellana 'Contorta') is 

a fine example. Standard weeping dwarf willows, such as 
weeping pussy willow (Salix caprea 'Kilmarnock') are also 
useful for outline, as are standard roses or tall upright 
conifers. 
 
5 - Using structures to enhance the 
arden's outline  
g 
Screens, arches or walls, made of trellis, timber, brick or 
stone will all help to develop a solid outline, but be sure to 
furnish such structures with plenty of plant material. Use 
clematis, honeysuckle (Lonicera), climbing and rambling 
roses to flesh out the bones of your structures.  
 
 
 
Strategically placed containers, statues or even gazebos will 
also help to develop a style. These can be as formal as you 
like, or could be as simple as a strawberry planter, furnished 
with edible strawberry plants, or with the pink-flowered 
ornamental strawberry, 'Pink Panda'.  
 
 
 
A garden should look great from the window. Try to arrange 
a sweeping view, or an enticing vista so that your eye is 
delighted every time you look out. This is especially 
important outside windows that are in frequent use, for 
example, kitchens.  
 
6  - Filling in  
Once your structure planting is in place, you can begin to fill 
up the spaces in between. Infill planting allows maximum 
scope for interesting colour schemes, for changes in mood 
and for interesting contrasts in texture of foliage.  
 
 
Compose for colour. In a small area, colour discipline will 
help you to achieve the desired effect. Complicated mixtures 
of colour seldom work, but if you plant with care, you can 
effect a gradual colour change as you move around the plot. 
 
 
Here are some colour ideas: 
 
 
• 
Gold, yellow, white  
Mock orange (Philadelphus coronarius 'Aureus') with
Spiraea 'Goldflame' and Aucuba 'Sulphurea'. 
Honeysuckle (Lonicera 'Baggesen's Gold') with pieris
and white or yellow roses. Underplanting could 
include ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum), day lily 
(Hemerocallis) and golden or variegated plantain lily
(Hosta). Include Euryops pectinatus for a splash of 
summer gold.  
• 
Cool hues  
Mexican orange blossom (Choisya ternata - not 
'Sundance'), for foliage and white flowers, planted 
with African lillies (Agapanthus). Bellflowers 
(Campanula) planted among shrubby hebe, myrtles 

(Myrtus) or lavenders (Lavandula). Plantain lily 
(blue-leaved hosta), hardy sage (Salvia) and 
fleabane (Erigerons) in soft colours.  
• 
Warmer pinks  
Rhododendrons - practically all of them. 'Flower 
Carpet' roses with ice plant (Sedum spectabile) for 
later colour. Anisodontea with shrubby bindweed 
(Convolvulus cneorum).  
Colour discipline is less crucial in winter and early spring 
when almost anything that flowers will be welcome. Always 
include plenty of bulbs, but avoid over-sized daffodils 
(Narcissus), since they may look out of scale and will 
certainly look untidy after flowering. Smaller daffodils will do 
a better job in a tiny garden.  
 
 
7  - Planning for impact  
Once the main planting is complete, you may want to 
consider adding a few special highlights to your garden. The 
purpose of such plants is to provide something extra - 
something that will lift your spirits at certain times of the 
year. Usually these will be flowers, but there are other 
aspects, such as fruits or seed capsules. Site your highlight 
plants where they will carry maximum impact.  
 
 
Here are some suggestions:  
 
 
• 
Startling bloomers  
Rhododendrons and azaleas are obvious choices, 
covered as they are with gorgeous blooms in spring.
However, camellias offer better value, since their off
season foliage is so glossy and beautiful. Look for 
the gorgeous but very hardy semi-double pink 
variety Camellia 'Donation'.  
• 
Fragrance  
Perfume can carry as big an impact as colour. Mock 
orange (Philadelphus) is bewitching, especially in a 
small space.  
Choose roses for scent too: 'Flower Carpet White' has gentle 
fragrance, for example, but 'Fragrant Cloud' and the climber 
'Zephirine Drouhin' are richly scented. Lavender (Lavandula) 
is both fragrant and aromatic, and makes a fine edging for a 
whole assortment of herbs including sage, rosemary, thyme, 
chives and mint - all of which smell wonderful.  
 
 
• 
Leafy  
Extra foliage, in summer, comes from the larger 
plantain lily (Hosta), lady's mantle (Alchemilla 
mollis) and the felty-leaved lamb's ears (Stachys 
'Silver Carpet'). Ice plant (Sedum spectabile) has 
fresh green, succulent foliage from April onwards, 
until the flowers appear in late summer. Brightest 
foliage of all is to be found on the Japanese willow 

variety 'Hakuro Nishiki'. The leaves are a mix of 
pink, pure white and green, but scorch very badly if 
exposed to sunlight.  
• 
Architectural  
Short-term architecture can be fun! Try placing an 
outsized plant - a mullein (Verbascum), perhaps, or 
rhubarb, like Rheum palmatum - in the foreground 
of your planting. It will be so out of scale as to look 
out of place, but the dramatic impact is 
considerable.  
Grow mint in a container, to prevent it from becoming too 
invasive. Cut it back regularly, to keep it young and tender.  
 
8  - Groundwork  
To make a full and valuable contribution in a tiny garden, 
every plant needs to be in the peak of health.  
 
 
Make sure border soil is weed-free, fertile and carries a high 
level of organic matter. Install a compost bin, if you have 
space, and compost all rottable garden refuse, including 
prunings, dead flowers etc, as well as vegetable kitchen 
waste. Spread compost back on the garden as soon as it has 
rotted down.  
 
 
Containers  
Most small gardens have lots of containers planted up, as 
well as borders. In some cases, there may not even be soil, 
and the entire planting will therefore be containerised.  
 
 
Ensuring year-round interest  
Include at least three plants from each section to ensure 
year-round interest in your garden.
