Advertising For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
A
dvertising, despite whatever impressions you have or information
you’ve heard, isn’t complicated — or rather, it’s only as complicated as
you want it to be. Sure, a lot is involved with advertising. Print, broadcast,
outdoor, direct mail, collateral materials, Internet — each media has its own
positives and negatives, its own mysterious production language, and its own
unique rates. How does a novice decipher this stuff? How do you know what
to buy and what to ignore?
Yes, advertising can seem complicated, even intimidating, but the good news
is that it ain’t rocket science. You just need a few tricks of the trade that help
you design, write, and implement a creative, hard-hitting, memorable ad cam-
paign for your business. The purpose of this book is to show you those
tricks.
About This Book
You can read this book front to back, or you can simply refer to it as you
would any reference book, dipping into the chapters you need right away.
Whichever way you read it, you may discover some shortcuts, insights, tech-
niques, and money-saving facts that can get you the most bang for the buck
while taking some of the mystery out of this all-important element of your
business.
Think of Advertising For Dummies, 2nd Edition, as a guidebook to map your
way through the back alleys, side streets, and secret pathways leading to
effective advertising. Advertising can be a very intimidating subject — it has
its own language; it comes in a huge array of media choices; it requires, when
done right, creativity, clarity, and solid production values to cut through its
own clutter; and it costs a lot of money. But advertising is also essential to
the success of your business. Use this travel guide to chart your course down
the hidden boulevards of advertising, and you may discover that, indeed, the
streets are paved with gold.

Conventions Used in This Book
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book,
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t have to read any text preceded by a Technical Stuff icon in order to
understand the chapter subject (though I urge you to read it if you’re feeling
the need for some surplus advertising brainpower). Some information also
appears in gray boxes known as sidebars. These sidebars are asides and not
critical to the text, so you don’t have to read them — though you may miss
out on some interesting information or anecdote if you skip them entirely!
Foolish Assumptions
This book is not for the CEO of a major corporation with virtually unlimited
funds for slick, glossy production, and mind-boggling amounts of cash for
media buys. Instead, this book is for entrepreneurs, owners of small to mid-
size businesses, and professionals selling important services — in other
words, anyone who’s trying to drum up business and create a successful
company with the help of advertising. This book is for the rest of us — the
people for whom an advertising budget represents an important percentage
of gross income and, therefore, a drain on the old take-home pay that must
be considered very seriously.
Over the years, I have helped numerous clients project clear, concise, cre-
ative messages within limited budget parameters. I used to dream of bound-
less production budgets with which to produce award-winning ads for both
print and broadcast. I always wondered what it would be like to take a com-
plete crew — cameramen, sound and lighting technicians, stunt drivers, fash-
ion models, actors, makeup people, hairstylists, even caterers — to some
exotic locale where I would have a one-month deadline within which to shoot
a 30-second, $2 million spot. It never happened. My guess is that less than 
1 percent of all professional advertising people actually work on the major
national accounts, creating the ads you see each night during prime time —
the ads produced with unrestricted budgets, which, sadly, still seem to miss

the mark more often than not. The other 99 percent of advertising profession-
als are guys like me.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five easily digestible parts, and each part is divided
into chapters. Here’s the scoop on what each part covers:
Part I: Advertising 101
From the moment you get out of bed in the morning, to late at night when you
turn off the television and turn out the lights, you’re bombarded with thou-
sands of advertising messages. Advertising is here, there, everywhere. And
into this clutter you now insert your own advertising. What you discover in
this part are the fundamentals of effective advertising. I also help you identify
your target market, set your sales goals, narrow your focus, and develop an
advertising plan that works. I delve into the complicated world of co-op adver-
tising reimbursement, in which your ad dollars are augmented by others.
I think you may be pleasantly surprised at the quality of media you can
afford, even on the smallest budgets. Mass media may, at first glance, appear
to be unaffordable. But regardless of the expense, when you consider how
many people you can reach with mass media, it’s the smartest way you can
spend your money. What you can’t afford to do is fritter away a limited ad
budget on questionable media that’s better suited to wrapping fish than it is
to attracting new customers to your business. So in this part, I help you plan
an advertising strategy that actually brings customers through your door.
Part II: Creating Great Ads 
for Every Medium
This part of the book is the longest, because the depth of your media choices
is simply mind-boggling (and new forms of media, both good and bad, are
introduced nearly every day). In this part, I stick to the mass media choices
of online ads and your own Web site, as well as newspaper, magazine, radio,
television, collateral, and outdoor advertising. I walk you through the steps of
writing broadcast and print ads that motivate and sell. I show you what goes
into producing radio and TV commercials, as well as print ads and brochures,

Introduction

and I queue you in on what you need to know to build a Web site and adver-
tise on the Internet. I also show you why continuity, delivering the same mes-
sage across all media, is the all-important key to a successful ad campaign.
Part III: Buying the Different Media
This part gets down to the nitty-gritty — the actual spending of your hard-
earned advertising budget. Here I take a hard look at investing in Internet
advertising, negotiating with print media to get the best possible page posi-
tion at the lowest possible price, and why buying television time isn’t nearly
as complicated as putting a man on the moon.
Here’s the best part of these chapters: I give you the inside scoop on getting
all kinds of free stuff (even vacations) as part of your media expenditures.
The chapters in this part give you the information you need in order to maxi-
mize your ad budget by spending it wisely. Finally, if you’ve considered hiring
an ad agency, this part is where I tell you who the players are and the pros
and cons of going this route.
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating 
Buzz and Using Publicity
In this part, I show you how to generate word-of-mouth and buzz about your
products or services. And I explain the difference between publicity and
public relations, help you write a good press release, and show you how to
get it published (hey, it’s free advertising). Finally, I walk you through the
unique nature of advertising specialties and premiums while showing you
how to increase their effectiveness, and I reveal how to become involved in
sponsored promotions and events. I even demonstrate how to invent suc-
cessful promotions of your own.
Part V: The Part of Tens
What, you may be asking, is a Part of Tens? It’s the part of every For Dummies
book that cuts right to the chase. If you don’t have time to read anything else
in this book, read these short lists of do’s and don’ts. In these lists of ten, 
I instruct you on writing effective, creative, clear copy for all media and help
you decide whether or not your business could use the services of an adver-
tising agency. (If you’re too busy to even read that chapter, hire an agency
right away.)

Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little pictures you find in the margins of this book. I use them
to grab your attention and steer you toward key bits of information. Here’s a
list of the icons I use in this book and what they mean:
Some of the points I make in this book are so important that you want to
commit them to memory. If you file these tidbits in your memory bank, you
will have gathered some very important details about the advertising 
business.
This icon marks insider tips I’ve gathered over the years. They can help you
avoid some of the mistakes I’ve figured out the hard way and give you a leg
up as you navigate the various elements leading to effective advertising.
As I lead you through the hidden back streets of advertising, I don’t want you
to stumble and fall. So I’ve marked some of the larger potholes and cracks in
the sidewalk with this Warning icon.
Whenever I wax nostalgic and feel the need to share stories of my past expe-
riences or interesting examples from others in the ad biz, you see this icon.
The advertising trade brings with it a ton of technical stuff, and I’ve marked
these areas with this icon. The good news is that you can safely skip over any
paragraph marked with this icon. But if you read it, you may discover infor-
mation that you can use to wow (if not confuse and dismay) the sales reps
and other ad people you deal with, not to mention your neighbors down the
street.
Where to Go from Here
You’re holding this book because you felt a need to discover the ins and outs
of the ad game. Think of this as a traveler’s guide that contains the charts
and maps you need in order to find your way through the weird and wonder-
ful world of advertising. You can begin your journey in the beginning, or you
can dive right into the middle — whichever works best for you.

A
dvertising: It’s here, it’s there, it’s everywhere!
Everyone is assailed with advertising messages every
waking moment. The obvious media –– television, radio,
newspapers, magazines, billboards, and direct mail –– are
just the tip of the advertising iceberg. Your cereal boxes,
milk cartons, clothing, bedding, fashion accessories, and
even your automobiles are covered in advertising. Into 
this cauldron of advertising vehicles has been thrown 
the Internet, grocery carts, the reverse side of cash 
register tapes, ATM screens, even displays in some 
public restrooms –– and all of this hype contributes to
advertising clutter.
If you want to advertise your business (and you most 
certainly should), you have to enter this world, jumping 
in with both feet. Daunting? You bet. Impossible? No way.
In this part, I share the fundamentals of advertising, help
you develop (and stick to!) a budget for your advertising
needs, and show you how to boost that budget by part-
nering with others via co-op advertising. I also offer guide-
lines on defining and positioning your message and aid
you in developing an ad campaign that can be effective 
for your business.

dvertising is a $300 billion industry in the United States alone. Plunkett
Research, Ltd. (the company that provided this figure) points out that
the large numbers don’t stop there. In the United States, advertisers flood the
following mediums in droves:
 1,749 broadcast TV stations (and that’s not including cable and satellite
TV outlets)
 13,599 radio stations
 2,250 daily and Sunday newspapers
And those figures don’t even take into consideration the thousands of maga-
zines, direct mail, Web sites, blogs, outdoor advertising (billboards, bus shel-
ters, and so on), or specialty or alternative advertising, which includes
everything from airplane banners at the beach to tchotchkes, small items like
tote bags, pens, and t-shirts that merchants and businesses give away to
remind consumers to do business with them.
With all these choices of how to get your message out there, how do you
decide what’s the best medium to reach the customers you’re looking for?
And how can you develop an ad campaign that won’t get lost in the morass?
You don’t have to hire an ad agency (though you can: Chapter 16 offers guid-
ance on how best to do this, and Chapter 20 gives you ten ways to know
whether you need outside help). But you can also do it yourself, and this
book tells how.

In this chapter, I fill you in on the basics of advertising — what’s effective and
what isn’t. Then I give you a short course on all your advertising options —
radio, TV (network and cable), magazines and newspapers, direct mail, out-
door, the Web, and more — and I show how you can put them to work for
you. Finally, I end with stories about two legends of advertising as well as
brief introductions of more recent ad giants, because if you focus on the 
best and figure out what they’ve done well, you can try to incorporate some
of their genius into your own advertising — and come out ahead of the 
competition.
Making Advertising Work
Effective advertising sells a product or a service that fulfills all the promises
made about it. On the other hand, effective advertising also sells inferior
products or services, but only once!
So what makes advertising effective? Effective advertising is:
 Creative: It delivers the advertising message in a fresh, new way.
 Hard-hitting: Its headline, copy, or graphic element stops readers or lis-
teners dead in their tracks.
 Memorable: It ensures that the audience will remember your business
when they think about the products and services you’re selling.
 Clear: It presents its message in a concise, uncomplicated, easy-to-grasp
manner.
 Informative: It enlightens the audience about your business and prod-
ucts, while giving them important reasons to buy from you.
 Distinctive: It is unique and immediately recognizable as yours.
The well-established brands that most people use every day — brands like
Coca-Cola and Pepsi, McDonald’s and Burger King, Budweiser and Miller,
Bayer and Advil, Ford and Chevy, Tide and Cheer — live up to the promises
made in their advertising. In fact, the products live up to the promise in such
a dramatic fashion that those products have become a part of the everyday
lives of millions of people. These products have been branded, which simply
means that when you think of soft drinks, fast food, beer, pain relievers, cars,
or laundry detergents, these brands come to mind. As surely as the cowboys
of the Old West branded the haunches of their cattle, these products have
been branded into your psyche — and the psyches of millions of other 
consumers.
10
Part I: Advertising 101 

When you begin to create advertising for your product or service, keep these
suggestions in mind:
 Don’t make promises you can’t live up to. Although your ad may draw
more people to your product initially, you can’t retain these people as
loyal customers in the long run if you make promises you can’t keep.
 Identify the best features of whatever it is you’re selling and develop
your advertising around these features. Think about how your product
stands out from the competition, what sets it apart, and then focus on
those attributes.
 Try to create a memorable advertising message for your product. You
want people to think of your store, your product, or your professional
service whenever they’re in the market for such a thing.
If your message is creative, clear, and concise, if your product or service is
something that can truly benefit people and live up to its hype, then you’re
on the road to producing effective advertising.
If your advertising makes bold promises about your product, you may con-
vince a lot of people to try it. But if those people buy your product and give it
a try, and the product turns out to be less than you advertised it to be, you
will most certainly never see those consumers again. Think about it: How
many times have you responded to an advertising message for a new,
improved, astounding product, only to be disappointed with the item after
you tried it? You probably even felt like you’d been ripped off. If your adver-
tising message leaves consumers with the same feeling, you simply won’t get
anywhere.
Getting to Know Your Media Options
Advertising comes in all shapes and sizes. And a big part of developing your
ad plans and campaign is to decide which mediums are best suited to adver-
tising your particular business. Following is a brief overview of your options,
with details from Plunkett Research, Ltd. to give you a ballpark idea on how
many billions of dollars are spent annually in each medium in the United
States.
Regarding radio
Radio advertising is a $20 billion business — and it has expanded both
because listeners can now tune in on the Internet and because of the devel-
opment of satellite radio (Sirius and XM subscriber-based programming). But
11
Chapter 1: Advertising: Mastering the Art of Promotion

it’s also competing with MP3 devices, which means there may be fewer listen-
ers to any given radio station or program.
But if your business appeals to consumers who’re likely to subscribe to this
type of programming, or if you can reach them on broadcast radio during
drive time or particular radio programs (especially those with celebrity
hosts), then you should consider this medium. Chapter 8 provides guidance
on developing memorable radio spots, and Chapter 14 offers information on
buying radio time to maximize your reach — and your budget.
Rating TV
TV is a $68 billion business — and that includes the almost 2,000 broadcast
stations plus the many cable and satellite TV stations. The growth in the
number of stations has actually made it easier for advertisers, because TV
programming is so much more targeted. For example, the audience for The
History Channel is probably very different from, say, Lifetime or Oxygen or
WE, the Women’s Entertainment channel.
Still, TV advertising is the most expensive medium (even with the tips offered
in Chapter 9 on how to create TV commercials and keep down the costs!), so
you should consider TV commercials only if you can afford them. TV is still a
mass medium, even with the more-focused channels mentioned, and your ad
budget may be better spent on a more narrowly focused media. But if you
decide TV is for you, see Chapter 15 for guidance on how to find the right sta-
tion and negotiate the best deal for your ad and your business.
Contemplating print
Print advertising encompasses both newspapers (daily and Sunday papers),
which is a $49 billion business, and magazines, which is a $21 billion business.
Newspapers are obviously a good choice if your business is regional and you’re
targeting a broad consumer base; magazines are more-specifically tailored to
different readers — for example, a subscriber to Glamour probably isn’t also
subscribing to, say, Maxim, though the media kits of each provide the details
on the number and demographics of the subscriber base. Chapter 7 offers
insight on how to write and design eye-catching print ads, and Chapter 13
offers ideas for how to choose the right publication and negotiate a good rate
for your ad.
Keep in mind, though, that many people who used to get information from
newspapers and magazines now have the additional option of online 
subscriptions — to either those same publications or to alternatives that
have never been printed on paper but are available only on the Internet.
Chapters 6 and 12 cover how to create and buy ad space in this new media.
12
Part I: Advertising 101 

Musing upon direct mail
Direct mail is a $45 billion business, and it’s alive and well even with the
growth of e-mail and other Internet advertising. Charitable organizations still
send pitches for funds to continue their good works (like The Red Cross, The
American Cancer Society, and Doctors Without Borders). Similarly, cultural
institutions use direct mail to solicit donor support, which they need to sup-
plement ticket prices from their audiences (think of your local theater com-
pany, public radio station, and even PBS). And direct mail includes the
myriad catalogs that fill all of our mailboxes — from Land’s End to L.L. Bean
to Victoria’s Secret, to J.Crew (to name just a few). Chapter 10 focuses on
developing strong direct-mail messages that can stand out among the abun-
dance in the mailbox.

Chapter 1: Advertising: Mastering the Art of Promotion
Imitation: The sincerest form of flattery
Every now and then I see or hear an image
advertisement that is so creative, so wonder-
fully conceived, and so (relatively) inexpensively
produced that I wish I had written it myself. It
has been said that no original ideas are out
there, but occasionally a fresh, new approach
to delivering the same old message comes
along. And I file it away in my memory as some-
thing that, someday, I may want to imitate. If the
ad is especially impressive, I even find out
which agency is responsible for it and write it a
congratulatory note.
One such ad was a radio spot for Berkeley
Farms, a major Northern California dairy.
Instead of creating a straight, consumer-
directed ad extolling the virtues of its milk, the
company created a recruitment ad for “new
employees.” Instead of just telling its audience
what superior milk they can take home when
they buy the Berkeley Farms brand, a warm,
motherly, female voice opens the spot with the
wonderful line, “If you’re a cow, I want to tell
you about Berkeley Farms — it’s a great place
to work.” She goes on to tell any cows who may
be listening that they can expect to be fed only
the finest hays and grains, which a full-time vet
is always on call in case they get sick, that their
stalls are always kept clean and tidy, and that
they are foolish cows indeed if they chose to
work anywhere else.
This spot is a memorable one because it uses a
creative twist — talking to the cows, not the
consumers — to a great advantage. Hey, if this
dairy is good enough for the cows, then it must
be good enough for you! And this spot can
undoubtedly inspire me to think of a fresh point-
of-view for some retail commercial I write in the
future.
When you sit down to write advertising for your
business, using ideas and techniques from
other advertising to help you find your own
“creative hook” is perfectly okay. No, I am not
giving you permission to lift someone else’s
copy verbatim or to steal a concept out of hand.
But good advertising done by others can be a
great source of creative inspiration. Even the
big boys do it. One advertising agency comes
out with a fresh, new look in its ads, something
that hasn’t been seen before, and everyone else
jumps all over it. It happens all the time. Just be
sure you know the difference between imitating
and plagiarizing, and stick to the former.

Scrutinizing outdoor advertising
Outdoor advertising includes everything from billboards on highways to ads
on bus kiosks, in subway cars, on taxis, or even on benches and other signage.
As a $6 billion industry, it’s a small part of overall annual ad expenditures,
but if you think it’s right for your business, Chapter 11 tells how to choose
the type of outdoor ad that can work best for you and how to design memorable
advertising in this medium.
Ogling online ads
Last, but by no means least, is the newest ad medium — online — even
though the Internet hardly seems “new”; still, it’s only been since the mid-’90s
that companies have used the Web to advertise products, services, and busi-
nesses. Chapter 6 offers the pros and cons of online advertising on various
Web sites (as well as how to develop your own), and it tells how to create
various types of online ad formats, do e-mail advertising, and create your
own blog. Chapter 12 picks up where Chapter 6 leaves off and helps you with
the financial side of online ads: hiring someone to help you create ads or
your Web site and buying space on other sites.
Poring over publicity
Technically, publicity isn’t really part of advertising, but good publicity can
serve to advertise your business. Publicity is really about getting someone
else to advertise your business. Basically, you’re calling attention to what
you’re doing in a way that your newspaper may want to report on it, or a
magazine may want to write a feature article about your business, or a TV
show host or radio host may be so intrigued by something you’ve done that
they talk about you on their shows. The two chapters in Part IV offer lots of
great ideas and success stories on how some businesses have done this 
successfully.
Where your advertising appears is every bit as important as what message it
contains — maybe even more so. Advertising is a numbers game: You want to
spend as little money as possible, as effectively as possible, to reach as many
people as possible, in order to make your phone and your cash register ring.
Consider your many media options very carefully. You can waste your adver-
tising dollars very easily by using the wrong media for your advertising goals.
Mass media advertising is affordable (turn to the chapters in Part III for more
information on costs). But so-called “affordable” advertising in the wrong
14
Part I: Advertising 101 

media is a gigantic waste of your dollars and your time. No matter how
affordable the media is, if it doesn’t bring customers through your door, you
aren’t really saving money. On the contrary, you’re draining your limited
budget without being the least-bit effective.
Lessons from the Legends: Figuring Out
Your Advertising Needs
Although your advertising may not come close to the greatest ads created by
the top ad agencies (after all, that’s not your intent in the first place), you can
still gather greatness from the best. The creative legends of the advertising
business have a perceptive understanding of consumers (and how to moti-
vate them). Because they understood consumers, they were able to produce
advertising that was so effective that it remained memorable decades after
the campaign’s end.
In the following sections, I describe some of the gurus of advertising whose
work has taught me much of what I know — and can do the same for you.
15
Chapter 1: Advertising: Mastering the Art of Promotion
A spectacularly ineffective advertising vehicle
One of the other tenants in our office building —
a small insurance company specializing in
assigned-risk auto coverage (for customers
whose driving records aren’t exactly stellar) —
recently unveiled its latest, breakthrough adver-
tising vehicle. And I do mean vehicle.
I came to work one morning and couldn’t miss it,
parked out on the curb in all its glory. The com-
pany had pounded out the dents on a 1960s
Volkswagen bus, spent $50 to have it freshly
painted a sparkling bathtub white, and bolted a
4-by-8-foot, double-faced billboard to the roof to
advertise its business. Because the old wreck
needed brakes, our business neighbors quit dri-
ving it around town and parked the thing con-
spicuously in the parking lot in front of our
building, much to the chagrin of the other ten-
ants. The sign that sat atop this moveable beast,
purportedly to tell the world about the com-
pany’s insurance business, included no less
than 32 words (including sure thing and no
driver refused) and an 11-digit phone number,
all arranged helter-skelter in 6 different fonts
and painted in 3 different colors.
The bus was a gigantic waste of advertising dol-
lars. But the business owner probably thought,
like so many small to mid-sized retailers and
service businesses do, that he couldn’t afford
“real” advertising. So he tried the VW bus rou-
tine instead. I don’t think I have to tell you to
avoid this kind of mistake at all costs.

David Ogilvy
The first book I ever read about the advertising business was Confessions of
an Advertising Man, by David Ogilvy (recently reissued in paperback by
Southbank Publishing). Ogilvy was an inspiration to me — and to thousands
of other advertising professionals. He died in 1999 at the age of 88, yet he’s a
true legend in the advertising world, even though the ads he made famous
were created decades ago.
Ogilvy is also famous for succinct statements about how to create com-
pelling, memorable ads. Here are just a few that I try to live by when writing
ads for my clients:
 “On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the
body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent 80
cents out of your dollar.”
 “Never write an advertisement you wouldn’t want your own family to
read. You wouldn’t tell lies to your own wife. Don’t tell lies to mine.”
 “Every word in the copy must count.”
 “We sell or else.”
 “Advertise what is unique.”
Born in England, David Ogilvy didn’t even get into the advertising business
until he was 39 years old. He had tried everything from selling stoves door-to-
door, to a brief tenure as a chef in Paris. He was even a member of the British
Secret Service. Financially broke at the age of 39, he cofounded an advertising
agency — Hewitt, Ogilvy, Benson & Mather. And he made a list of five clients
he wanted to land: General Foods, Bristol-Myers, Campbell’s Soup, Lever
Brothers, and Shell Oil. Eleven years later, he had them all.
Ogilvy preached the virtues of sales-driven copy. He also expected advertis-
ing copy to be expressed with clarity, relevance, and grace. He knew that the
real purpose of advertising is to sell. His ads may have been gorgeous, but
they were filled with unique product difference and sell — albeit with an emo-
tional edge. He invented eccentric personalities to capture the reader’s atten-
tion, based on the idea that memorable faces help make memorable brands.
Ogilvy also said, when talking about creative types who worked for (or
wanted to work for) his agency, “Every copywriter should start his career by
spending two years in direct response.” What he meant is that the primary
purpose of advertising is to sell.

Bill Bernbach
Bill Bernbach was the Creative Director for Doyle, Dane, Bernbach during its
heyday. Working with Helmut Krone as Art Director, Bernbach invented a new
way to project a message to consumers, by introducing wonderful creativity
and a kinder, gentler approach to advertising. The agency led the way with its
fanciful Volkswagen ads from the 1960s, which supplied both entertainment
and product information. Do you remember “Think small”? It was a huge shift
in advertising communication and became the industry standard that lives to
this day.
So memorable and trend-setting was that original Volkswagen advertising
that when the New Beetle was introduced in the 1990s, the agency for
Volkswagen of America, Arnold Communications of Boston, chose not to
17
Chapter 1: Advertising: Mastering the Art of Promotion
Dot-coms to dot-bombs in one easy lesson
Whenever I think of Bill Bernbach’s very insight-
ful quote, “Dullness won’t sell your product, but
neither will irrelevant brilliance,” I’m reminded
of the super-expensive commercials for various
fledgling dot-com businesses that ran during
the Super Bowl broadcast in January 2000.
Clearly, most of these businesses had never
bothered to read Bill Bernbach, because their
commercials simply reeked of “irrelevant 
brilliance.”
And most of the dot-com spots, purchased for
as much as $1.5 million per 30 seconds, were so
contrived, so devoid of a selling message (let
alone a call to action), and so downright con-
fusing that they wasted most, if not all, of their
millions of ad bucks. This misuse of funds is also
true of companies in other industries that
choose to gamble the entire year’s ad budget 
on the Super Bowl commercials, but the 2000
dot-com debacle was the worst. The majority 
of these companies didn’t survive more than 
six months after their spots appeared — other
than Pets.com, whose adorable sock-puppet
spokesman starred in several Super Bowl 
commercials (before the company eventually
went kaput).
Why weren’t these flashy ads successful?
Because they not only forgot Bernbach’s rule,
but they also ignored one of Ogilvy’s — namely,
“We sell or else.” Their spots were so clever
that they forgot to include a selling message
that actually motivates someone to buy. Sadly,
many even forgot to mention what service or
product it was that they were selling. And, most
important, they forgot to tell viewers why
anyone should buy it.
These companies and their agencies got so lost
in having a creative, good time on unlimited pro-
duction budgets that they forgot why they were
buying the incredibly expensive time on the
most-watched show on television in the first
place — they simply forgot to sell us something.

create a completely new campaign from the ground up, but rather to emulate
the original concept. For example, the campaign for the New Beetle featured
lots of white space (a Krone innovation that means just what it says — the ad
wasn’t filled with color and copy from edge to edge), a small photo of the VW
New Beetle in profile, and brief copy that read, “Zero to 60? Yes.” This kind of
advertising is great stuff, and a compliment to the original ads created by
Doyle, Dane, Bernbach over 40 years ago. In fact, Arnold Communications,
when submitting its work for awards, still lists Krone and Bernbach as cre-
ative contributors.
Bill Bernbach, like David Ogilvy, was good for a pithy quote now and then,
including the following: “Dullness won’t sell your product, but neither will
irrelevant brilliance.”
Wieden and Kennedy
Dan Wieden and David Kennedy took advertising out of its traditional centers
of the ad world (Madison Avenue in New York City., Chicago, and to some
extent, Los Angeles) by setting up shop in Portland, Oregon. They’re listed on
the top 100 people in advertising (for the last century, no less!). They’ve done
great work for Microsoft, ESPN, and many other clients, but they’re still prob-
ably best known for revolutionizing the sneaker industry — or at least the
advertising of it — by creating Nike’s “Just do it” campaign.

C
ompanies like Procter & Gamble, General Motors, and McDonald’s spend
more on advertising each year than the average small to mid-size busi-
ness could ever hope to gross in a lifetime. No one knows (and the compa-
nies aren’t telling) what their advertising budget to gross income ratios
actually are, but you can bet they’re high. These companies have spent a
king’s ransom to successfully position their products to be top-of-mind with
the entire buying public — and it costs them a yearly fortune to maintain this
branding of their products. (For more on branding, check out Branding For

company’s products begins to slip in overall sales, it throws $25 million in
extra advertising funds at the problem without a second thought. The total
amounts of their ad funds are simply astounding — for example, Coca-Cola
spent $2.5 billion on advertising worldwide in 2005.
You, on the other hand, very likely look upon your advertising dollars as a
seriously important personal investment — an investment that (shudder!)
comes right off the bottom line and, therefore, is never a part of your hard-
earned take-home pay. For this reason, you need to do some careful planning
as you decide what percentage of your gross sales you can realistically afford
to spend for advertising. You don’t want to overdo it, but you can’t skimp too
much either. As with many things in life, balance is what it’s all about.

In this chapter, you discover what some companies spend on their advertis-
ing so you can decide what you want to spend. You also take a look at how
and where your competitors are advertising and why it’s crucial to know
exactly who your target market is and how your business can appeal to it 
(if you don’t already!). I also give you tips on how you can get the most bang
for your advertising buck by weighing the pros and cons of advertising in
major or local newspapers; in national, regional, or specialized magazines; 
on radio; on broadcast or cable TV; and on the Internet.
Determining How Much You 
Can Afford to Spend
So, what dollar amount, or percentage of gross sales, should you invest in
your advertising budget? The question is a very tough one. And although I
can give you some guidelines, only you are able to answer it when it’s all said
and done. After all, it’s your money.
A good place to start when you’re setting a budget is in examining your goals.
If you want to become the Big Dog — that is, if your driving ambition is to ele-
vate your business into an industry-leadership position and blow your com-
petition away — then of course you need to spend a lot more money than if
you’re satisfied with just getting by. In this book, I make the assumption that
you want to do much better than just getting by — you wouldn’t be advertis-
ing at all if you didn’t want your business to grow and prosper. But in order to
see the kind of success you’re after, you need an ad budget.
Over half of new businesses fail within their first two years. This depressing
statistic is probably due to a number of factors, but a lack of working capital
(cash) is usually at the top of the list. Most businesses start out with great
hopes and limited cash, and it’s the hand-to-mouth reality of a start-up that
kills most of them. When people open new businesses, they often forget to
set aside enough money for a large enough ad budget to get their name out
there. You can invent a better mousetrap, but not having enough working
capital to afford to tell the world about it is like trying to tow a boat with a
rope.
To get an idea of what typical businesses spend on advertising, I asked sev-
eral of my agency’s clients what percentage of gross sales they spend. Not a
single one of them could give me a straight answer to my question. They had
each used a different formula to arrive at their budget number, and they each
planned their advertising expenditures, using different criteria.
20
Part I: Advertising 101 

Our agency has one retail client who spends as much as 10 percent of gross
sales on advertising. Although this percentage may seem high, some busi-
nesses must spend that amount in order to compete, and I’ve worked for
clients who spent even more. On the other hand, I’ve seen businesses spend
2 percent or less on advertising — and in the case of very small companies,
some don’t spend even that much on a sustained basis. Most small busi-
nesses spend between 2 and 7 percent of their gross sales on advertising,
though some allocate as much as 10 percent.
Percent of gross is a very helpful budgeting tool, but it can leave a start-up
business with inadequate exposure. Start-ups often must budget a percentage
of projected gross, overspending in the introduction of your business to build
business to a profitable level.
You can use these figures as general guidelines to help you set your own
advertising budget, but keep in mind that each business is unique. What
works for one company may not work for another. When in doubt, follow this
simple rule: Spend as much money on advertising as it takes to make and sus-
tain an impact in the marketplace, but don’t spend so much that you run the
risk of putting your business into financial jeopardy.
You can begin the process of setting a budget by trying to come up with some
answers to the following questions:
 How big is your business?
 How much yearly income does your business generate?
 What do you want to accomplish with your advertising, and how much
will that cost?
 What is your competition spending?
If you’re in a highly competitive business, such as cell phones, restaurants,
clothing boutiques, or car sales and repairs, you need to step up to the plate
with some serious bucks in order to hit a homerun in your marketplace. Your
competition is spending their brains out, and you have to do the same. On
the other hand, if your business enjoys a unique status in your market, if you
provide merchandise or a service that people can’t find elsewhere, then you
can get away with much lower spending.
If your budget is too limited to make an impact in the market on a daily or
weekly basis, stash your cash until you’re having some special event or sale
and then attack the media full-force. In advertising, you’re better off having a
big voice once in a while than a weak voice every day.
21
Chapter 2: Setting and Working within Your Advertising Budget

Developing an Advertising Strategy 
and a Tactical Plan
You probably went into business to succeed — and that means you’ll do
whatever it takes to reach this lofty goal . . . as long as it’s legal and within
fiscal reason. But in order to succeed with your advertising — or with any-
thing in life, actually — you need a plan of action. In this section, I help you
come up with a plan that works for you.
Researching and evaluating 
your competition
A good step to consider when devising your advertising plan, and planning
the extent of your budget, is to analyze what your competition is doing. In
Part III, I give some guidelines and relative costs for all media, but you can
pin it down even further with a few well-placed phone calls in your own area.
Here are some guidelines:
 Do you see ads for your competitors in the newspaper on a regular
basis? If so, call the paper and ask for its retail display-ad rate in order
to figure out how much the competition is spending to advertise there.
 Do you hear competitors’ radio commercials often? Call the station’s
sales department and ask about its rates. A salesperson will likely tell
you precisely what your competition is spending so she can talk you into
doing the same thing.
 Does your weekly mail bring coupons or brochures from your compe-
tition? Again, contact the vendor of the mail pack that sends these
coupons and find out what those ads cost.
Why should you want to know what your competition is spending? Because
this information gives you some basis for planning your own budget.
Forewarned is forearmed, which in this case means that gathering informa-
tion about the other guys helps you make a quantified judgment as to how
much you need to spend in order to compete with them. If you own a mom-
and-pop hardware store, you may have a tough time generating a budget that
can compete with the monster-size warehouse stores — but don’t panic.
Simply outspending the other guy (or even trying to keep up with him) isn’t
the whole answer.
22
Part I: Advertising 101 

You may be relieved to know that you can spend a lot less than your competi-
tion and still make more of an impact by being more creative with both your
message and your media buying. You can make up for a lack of money with an
abundance of creativity and careful — no, make that diligent — media negoti-
ation and spending. You can also make your available advertising budget
stretch if you don’t waste any of it on irrelevant media that brings you little
or no business.
Regardless of the limits of your ad budget, and whether you’re trying to reach
a broad audience, accept this as a given: You can afford mass media. You can
afford to buy radio commercials, ads in a mass-circulation daily newspaper,
spots on broadcast television and cable stations, ads in the regional editions
of major magazines, and a variety of Internet advertising, including your own
Web site. This media may, at first, appear to be unaffordable. But, regardless
of the expense (which may be less than you think), when you consider how
many people you can reach, it’s the smartest way you can spend your money.
What you can’t afford to do is fritter away a limited ad budget on question-
able media, like the dozens of ads you find in your mailbox every day, that
are better suited for wrapping fish than they are for attracting new customers
to your business. The old saw “You get what you pay for” is never truer.
Identifying your target market
By identifying your primary target market, you can do a better job of narrow-
ing your media buys, which leads you to a bottom-line budget figure that
makes sense. This information also helps you when the time comes to design
and write your ads. Teenagers, as you know, speak an entirely different lan-
guage than adults, so not only must you buy the media they’re attracted to,
but you also want to write and design your ads to attract their attention in
the first place.
For example, if you own a skateboard store, then you’re going to target teens
rather than senior citizens, right? And those teens aren’t reading the newspa-
per or looking at direct mail pieces; instead, they’re online at their favorite
Web sites, listening to very narrowly programmed radio stations, and watch-
ing certain TV shows. If, on the other hand, you’re selling luxury cars that are
purchased primarily by affluent adults over 55, you can do well by placing
ads in the business section of your paper and buying spots on radio stations
programmed with news, talk, oldies, or classical music. In other words, just a
little bit of thought into who your target market is and what forms of media it
pays attention to can save you lots of money and tons of grief.
23
Chapter 2: Setting and Working within Your Advertising Budget

Knowing your product’s appeal
What you’re selling helps you determine what media you should be buying.
Are you selling tires? Then make print your primary media, because you need
to list all those different brands, sizes, and prices in those long columns of
itsy-bitsy type. You may also call attention to your print ads with some radio
spots. And, if you want to show how clean and beautiful your shop is, con-
sider some TV. Direct mail, if it’s a stand-alone piece for you and you alone,
can be somewhat effective as well.
On the other hand, are you selling a professional service such as accounting,
financial management, or consulting? Then you want to look at news, talk, or
another radio format listened to by business people. If print is in your ad
plan, then the local business journal or the business section or main news
section of your newspapers are good bets.
If you’re selling beauty products or run a hair or nail salon, you need to reach
your target market by buying on radio stations that can prove to you their
audience composition includes mostly women. Women also read the newspa-
per’s business page in great numbers, as well as the entertainment, society,
style, home, and main news sections. And dozens of television shows, even
entire cable stations, are targeted toward women — for example, the Lifetime
network, WE (Women’s Entertainment), Oxygen, and many others.
What I’m getting at here is that you must narrow your focus in order to get a
handle on the amount you need to invest in advertising, by identifying your
primary market segment. There’s no sense in taking the shotgun approach
when a well-aimed rifle shot can find more of who you’re looking for — and
for a lot less money. If you’re selling a female-oriented product, you don’t
want to waste too much of your ad budget advertising to men, and vice
versa. Sure, you’ll get some spillover, and you can’t do anything about that.
But targeting your media buys as narrowly as possible saves you money in a
big way.
Maximizing Your Budget
You need to spend enough money on advertising to make an impact in the
marketplace. You need to make some noise — be heard above the din of
other advertising messages. But you don’t want to spend more on advertising
than you can comfortably afford. Making the most of the money you have can
be a difficult tightrope act.
24
Part I: Advertising 101 

One of my clients, whose advertising budget remains steady from month to
month regardless of ups and downs in sales, preaches consistency as the
number one rule in his advertising plans. His philosophy is simple: In order
to compete, you must be heard. You want consumers to think of your busi-
ness when they’re in the market for the products you sell, so you should at
least have some advertising presence at all times. His thinking is, over the
year, it all averages out.
On the other hand, not everyone can afford to have an advertising presence
year-round. You may not even need to be out there every day. By virtue of
your unique product or service, you may be able to do a fine job by only
advertising special events or sales on an as-needed basis. This kind of adver-
tising requires a bit more planning and creative-media buying in order to get
the job done, but it’s a workable option for many businesses.
Finally, many businesses simply don’t have enough money to do much more
than advertise when they absolutely have to, such as at Christmas or back-to-
school times.
No matter what group you fall into, keep in mind that you can save big bucks
in many different ways, several of which I outline for you in the following 
sections.
Getting the most out of your 
creative and production
Creative and production are areas that, with just a bit of good writing and
skillful execution, are perfect places to save money without sacrificing effec-
tiveness. Your ads can look and sound like champagne, even though your
budget can only afford beer. You don’t need to spend a small fortune produc-
ing a television commercial to sell something that could easily be explained
in a well-written and cleverly produced radio spot. Nor do you need to buy a
full-page, four-color newspaper ad when a small-space, black-and-white ad
with a killer headline and graphic will likely attract as much or more atten-
tion. And you needn’t waste money on a so-called celebrity spokesperson to
pitch your business on radio if you can hire an actor who simply has a great
voice.
You can save money on advertising production if you begin with a clever con-
cept and good writing that take cost-effective production into consideration
from the very beginning. In other words, don’t write a TV spot that must be
filmed beneath the Eiffel Tower if you can’t afford to send a film crew to
France. Putting together a radio spot by using French music, European traffic
25
Chapter 2: Setting and Working within Your Advertising Budget

sound effects, and an actor with a believable French accent may be a bit
more cost-effective. If you do it right, the listener will add the mental image of
the Eiffel Tower for you, free of charge.
Okay, so you’re not planning to do a full-blown commercial shoot in Paris, but
you may be tempted to write and produce a TV spot because you feel your
product is so darned visual that the consumer simply must see it to appreci-
ate it. Here are two truths to ponder before you bite off more than you can
chew:
 Television production costs more than radio production.
 Radio can conjure visual images in the mind of the listener if you use it
correctly.
Armed with this information, why not write a radio commercial that’s filled
with visual imagery and costs only a pittance to produce as compared to a
TV spot? These mental images (the theater of the mind, as I call it) can be
more effective than showing the actual product. For example, a chain of furni-
ture stores my agency handles hasn’t done television in years because we
proved to them that radio can effectively paint mental pictures of the various
furniture pieces they’re selling. With the same amount of dollars they were
spending on one or two broadcast or cable TV stations, they’re now buying
time on a half-dozen radio stations — and their business has never been
better.
Begin by planning a creative concept that can, at the same time, be produced
inexpensively and is clever enough to be heard above the roar. Easier said
than done, you say? Perhaps. But it’s not impossible, and it can be quite a bit
of fun. Besides, why would you want to do boring advertising? Consumers
don’t want to see or hear any more boring advertising — they’re already satu-
rated with it. They’d much rather see or hear clever, funny, memorable ads
that, more often than not, will jolt them into responding. This type of adver-
tising is what you should be shooting for.
Want a voice for your radio spot or TV commercial? Call your ad agency, or
look in the Yellow Pages under “Talent Agencies & Casting Directors.”
Using media you can afford
I get into the meaty parts of media negotiation, planning, and buying in Part
III. But for now, I help you consider a few of your options as you formulate
your budget strategy. This section may give you some pleasant surprises, or
at least dispel some of your beliefs about media affordability.
26
Part I: Advertising 101 

Online
One way to advertise your business is, of course, on the Internet. You can
build your own Web site, or you can hire someone to do it for you — and 
the Internet itself provides guidelines. Just type “creating a Web site” into 
a search engine and you can find loads of resources to either walk you
through the process or to find people who can create a Web site for you.
Most companies — even small businesses — have found this format is an
inexpensive way to make their presence known to potential customers. A
well-designed Web site increases your credibility, makes it easier for potential
customers to discover the products and services you offer, and allows you to
sell directly on the Internet.
You can also advertise your business on other companies’ Web sites in a vari-
ety of ways that match your needs and budget — for example:
 Banner ads: The rectangular ads that appear on a Web page inviting
viewers to click on the banner, which then takes them to your Web site.
 E-mail lists and newsletters: Send a quick e-mail to customers who have
expressed interest in receiving information from your business. Be care-
ful not to send an e-mail to just anyone: You don’t want your business to
be viewed as spam or junk e-mail!
 Links to your Web site: When consumers are searching the Web for
information on a particular topic, they find links to other Web sites 
promoting products or services related to that topic — such as books,
magazines, and other publications, as well as associations and organiza-
tions of users of that product, service, and so on. These links are called
sponsored links.
 Interstitial ads: This fancy name is for something you now see all the
time on the Web — the pages or pop-up boxes that appear mysteriously
after you click on a link but before you get to the place you clicked to get
to. An interstitial page may open and close automatically, and they can
be highly effective if done well. If these ads are interesting, consumers
may allow them to remain on screen for far longer than the usual banner
ad, so the CPM (cost per thousand) should be quite high.
Pop-up ads have a drawback. As you probably know from your own
experiences surfing the Web, pop-up ads can also be quite annoying, so
if yours isn’t interesting or relevant to what the consumer was originally
looking for, many consumers will shut it down immediately.
 Rich-media ads: These ads include drop-down boxes, moving images,
sound, or music that starts when consumers move their mouses over
the ads, small games, and other forms of multimedia advertising. In gen-
eral, both customers and the Web sites that offer rich-media ads like
27
Chapter 2: Setting and Working within Your Advertising Budget

them because consumers don’t have to actually leave the site to interact
with the banner, and clickthrough (which is when a consumer actually
clicks on an ad to visit the Web site being advertised, instead of just
viewing the ad but not going further) can be quite high.
 Keyword advertising: This Internet form is where you pay a search
engine, directory, or some other Web site to have your ad or the link to
your site pop up first when someone does a search on the keywords you
buy. For example, if a consumer is searching for information on knitting,
she may type “knitting” into an Internet search engine. Because your
business is designer knitwear or knitting instruction (and you’ve paid
that search engine for keyword advertising), your ad is among the first
to appear to the customer.
 Word-of-mouth advertising: The Internet is also the perfect place to
take advantage of this form of online advertising via message boards,
online clubs, blogs, chat rooms, and the list goes on — and most of it is
free.
These types of online advertising are just a few you should consider for your
business. Spend some time surfing the Web to see what type of ads are being
run by other companies that offer the same type of product or service as
your business, and decide what works best for you (and your budget — don’t
forget the budget!). Don’t be hesitant to think outside the box to see what
other businesses that don’t compete with yours are doing, because you may
also want to borrow some of their approaches to Internet advertising! Flip to
Chapters 6 and 12 for more information on advertising on the Internet.
Newspaper
In the area of print, you don’t need to buy large ads in order to be noticed.
Take a look at your daily paper and you can see that, in most cases, the
smaller ads are placed at the top of each page — they sit atop the large space
ads. The newspaper’s layout department just does it this way, for some
reason. Now, while I can’t deny that the eye may be first drawn to the largest
ads on a page, it stands to reason that if your message is clear enough, pre-
sented in a clever way, and positioned near the top of the page with a good
headline and an eye-catching graphic element, you can get as good a
response as the guy whose big, fat ad is sitting beneath yours and contains
none of the above. See Chapters 7 and 13 for more information on advertising
in print.
Radio
Advertising your business on the radio varies widely in price, depending on
the time of day you want. For example, WXTU 92.5 country music in
Philadelphia charges $425 for a mid-day ad but only $75 to $100 for an
evening ad. So think carefully about when your target audience is most likely
listening and what works best for your budget. Want to find out more? Check
out Chapter 8.

One of the top-rated news- and talk-radio stations in the Bay Area sells prime-
time ads (during the morning and evening commute) for prices in the $1,000-
to $1,500-per-spot range, but its late night (midnight to 6:00 a.m.) ads can be
had for as low as $100 a spot. I actually know of one local business that buys
the late-night time slot on this station and pays for the commercials with
$100 bills. The beleaguered station sales rep has to schlep over to his office
to collect the money this guy pays in advance for whatever number of spots
he can afford on any given week. This strategy may sound a bit hokey, but
advertising on this station during the late-night time slots really works for
this guy. He has a presence on a major station, which gives his business an
aura of prestige, and he gets it on a surprisingly low budget. So, what is the
moral of this little story? On radio, you don’t need major ad bucks in order to
sound like you do.
Another affordable way to buy radio is by taking advantage of the package
deal, which includes a certain number of prime spots, a few mid-days, a few
overnights, and a few rotators (spots that the station may run anywhere it
likes). Radio stations usually tell you that they’ll sell these packages to you
for only “$50 a spot!” or whatever the amount — referred to as an average
spot cost. And that’s true if you look at the average cost of the ads when
grouped together. But because you reach a lot more people during the morn-
ing commute than you can hope to reach at 3:00 a.m., an average spot cost
isn’t the best way to analyze the cost effectiveness of package deals. You’re
better off asking the station rep how many gross impressions the spots in the
package will generate — that number tells you how many people will actually
hear the ads, which in turn helps you decide whether the package is all that
it’s cracked up to be.
Cable TV
Cable television is an affordable media, but if you use it, you need to be dili-
gent about a few details. Here are some questions you need to ask before 
you buy:
 On which of the cable channels will my spots run?
 At what times will the spots run on those channels?
 In which zones will my spots run?
Sound confusing? I can tell you how confusing it really is: Cable TV has been
known to reduce a professional media buyer to tears. And a seasoned ad
agency’s accounts payable manager once said that he’d rather schedule a
root canal than try to decipher a cable station’s invoice. Here’s why: Every
cable company is selling ads on a hundred or more different channels; each
channel is programmed to reach a separate and unique market segment and
is broadcast into various zones within the overall coverage area. So, although
eminently affordable, particularly at a paltry two bucks a spot in some cases,
make sure you know precisely what you’re buying. Chapters 9 and 15 explore
cable TV in more detail.
29
Chapter 2: Setting and Working within Your Advertising Budget

Broadcast TV
TV advertising prices vary widely depending on the time of day. For example,
at the time of this writing, Channel 6 (ABC/WPVI) in Philadelphia charges the
following prices at different times of day:
 $1,000 for a 30-second commercial that runs during its weekday local
news at 5 a.m.
 $1,400 for a 30-second commercial that runs during weekday local news
at 12 noon
 $3,300 for a 30-second commercial that runs during weekday local news
at 5 p.m.
 $5,000 for a 30-second commercial that runs during weekday local news
at 6 p.m.
Of course, these prices vary from week to week and season to season. The
total range of prices is anywhere from $500 to $50,000 — the high end being
the price for a 30-second commercial during, say, the finale of a popular TV
drama or national sporting event.
But broadcast television can be affordable in certain time slots. One chain of
auto-repair shops for which I have done work buys one or two 30-second
commercials daily on the early morning news show (6:00 a.m.) and the early
fringe news program (5:00 p.m.) on the local ABC-TV station. Because he’s on
these local news shows every day, and because these shows are very reason-
ably priced, he has a substantial television presence (at least with the people
who watch those shows) for less than $5,000 a month.
Late night, early morning, and even midday time slots may offer just the kind
of programming that your target market views. And these time slots are
priced within the budgets of most local advertisers (so that’s why you see all
those car dealer ads at those times).
National magazines
Yes, unbelievably, you can afford to buy ads in big-time magazines like Time,
Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, and the like by buying advertising in what’s
called their regional editions. You can place your ad in one of these publica-
tions, or a predetermined group of publications that is sold as a package, for
relatively small amounts because all the big magazines break down their cir-
culation (and actual printing) into zones or regions. For instance, you can
buy an ad for the circulation of the entire Bay Area, or break it down to just
your city. Some magazines will also sell you a cover wrap, sort of like a book’s
dust jacket, which can be a fairly prestigious way to get the word out there!
30
Part I: Advertising 101 

Although magazine advertising is a rather dramatic vehicle for a local busi-
ness to use, it doesn’t cost nearly as much as you think. When you can buy a
big-time publication that allows you to pay only for the area from which you
can reasonably expect to attract business, you can afford to at least look like
a major player. So, if you want to impress the neighbors and keep up with the
Joneses, pop a full-page ad into Time magazine. That ought to get their atten-
tion! For more on national magazine ads, turn to Chapter 7.

Bottom line: Go bargain hunting
You want an advertising presence in media that
gives you your best chance of attracting large
numbers of customers. The various media
options listed in this chapter are only a few of
the many ways you can save money and still
buy media that does you the most good. In Part
III, I provide even more information on the vari-
ous forms of media and how to buy them.
Concentrate your available dollars in good, solid
media — even though you may not be able to
afford to buy prime-time TV commercials or full-
page magazine ads. Don’t toss away your
money on cockamamie “deals” offered to you
by off-the-wall media that no one will pay atten-
tion to. In other words, don’t buy a rotten egg
when you can afford a lovely omelet.
Go bargain hunting. Your local media, even
some of the national media, have some great
deals.

Chapter 3
Boosting Your Budget 
with Co-Op Programs
In This Chapter
 Clearing up what co-op advertising funds are
 Finding suppliers who have funds you can use
 Being aware of the supplier’s restrictions
 Applying for, and receiving, co-op money
M
any suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors of various major prod-
ucts and goods have advertising money set aside for use by their
retailers. These funds are called cooperative advertising (co-op for short). The
term cooperative means just what it says: If you spend some money, the man-
ufacturer will also spend some money — the two of you cooperate to get the
advertising job done.
Although co-op advertising is sometimes very complicated, frustrating, con-
fusing, and time-consuming, it’s well worth the effort. Co-op funds are won-
derful when you can add these extra dollars to your own advertising budget
and use them to make a much bigger splash in your market. In this chapter, I
give you the information you need to put co-op funds to work for you, demys-
tifying this often-confusing part of the advertising arena.
Knowing Who Uses Co-Op Funds
Each week, you probably receive one or more multi-page, color brochures
from your local supermarkets. These brochures are filled with this week’s
bombastic specials on everything from soft drinks to bathroom tissue, dog
food to deodorant — and they usually contain coupons you can use when
you shop at their stores. These newsprint brochures are almost entirely paid

for with co-op funds provided to your local grocer by the companies that pro-
duce the dozens of items listed inside. Each of the manufacturers, suppliers,
or distributors pays for the percentage of advertising space it receives in
each brochure.
For instance, if the toilet paper company is getting one full page of a 20-page
flyer, it tosses 5 percent of the total cost of the brochure into the pot. By
advertising only those products that provide co-op funds, your grocer can, in
theory, produce and distribute these weekly brochures without spending a
dime of his own money.
Virtually any small business you can think of sells products for which co-op
ad funds are available. If you’re a store owner, look around your store, and
you may be able to identify products from big-name manufacturers who, in all
likelihood, have co-op or vendor dollars set aside to aid you in selling these
items.
Many small businesses either don’t know co-op money is available, or they
find the thought of collecting the funds too daunting. For this reason, a lot of
available cash is left on the table because small businesses often think they
have better things to do than fill out forms and adhere to certain rules in
order to collect a few extra bucks to throw at advertising. You can work this
situation to your favor, however, by taking advantage of the money your com-
petitors aren’t seizing for themselves. Yes, it’s work. But when you receive a
nice check from one of your manufacturers, or some free goods, or a big dis-
count off your next purchase, the extra work is well worth your time and
trouble.
Supply and demand are very important things to remember when you’re con-
sidering co-op funds. Here’s an example for you to mull over: The manufac-
turers and distributors that supply the grocer provide a certain amount of
co-op money based on the total amount of their products the grocer pur-
chases. If the grocer buys 1,000 cases of creamed corn for a special price and
then advertises “dramatic savings” on that merchandise in his weekly mailer,
he may get $1,000 in extra co-op funds as part of his deal with the creamed
corn supplier. And you can bet that the grocer won’t buy 1,000 cases of any
particular brand of creamed corn unless he also gets a boost of co-op money
from the supplier to help him peddle it.
When you add up all the items advertised in these flyers, you can be sure
that someone in the grocer’s advertising department spent a heck of a lot of
time finding and figuring out what money was available from which suppliers,
and how to collect and spend it. A local chain of supermarkets for which I
have done advertising work has a full-time employee who does nothing but
handle co-op funds.

Part I: Advertising 101 

The grocery business is just one example of who takes advantage of co-op
funds and what they must do to collect them. Many other businesses offer
co-op funds. For example, when you walk into a bookstore and see certain
books displayed prominently at the front of the store or on end-caps (the
face-out display of books at the end of an aisle), you probably know those
store owners or managers didn’t feature those particular books simply
because they enjoyed reading them. Instead, the publishers of the books on
display cooperated with the store owners by spending money to advertise
those books. And those promotions typically tie in to some theme or holiday,
such as books by African-American authors during Black History Month
(February), coffee-table books at the December holidays, or golf and other
stereotypically “manly” pastimes around Father’s Day.
And, of course, it’s not just bookstores that do this: Hardware and home-
improvement stores partner with the manufacturers of the tools and raw
materials they sell, and even service businesses may be able to find compa-
nies that offer co-op funds available to them, if the service includes products
available from other vendors. In other words, co-op opportunities are as
diverse as the companies that offer it. But you can always find a catch —
there’s no such thing as a free lunch (free creamed corn, perhaps, but no free
lunch). The retailer or small business (that’s you) must adhere to certain rules
and make certain purchases in order to qualify for and collect co-op money.
But don’t be dismayed — it’s worth it! (For more on these qualifiers, check out
the section “Understanding the Rules, Regulations, and Restrictions.”)
Another form of cooperative funding is called vendor money. Vendor money is
in addition to any of the manufacturer’s co-op funds you may be entitled to.
It’s usually passed along to the squeakiest wheel — the clever retailer who
knows it exists and has the cheek to go after it. Vendor money has no strings
attached; you receive it either in the form of cash or as a discount on future
purchases.
Finding Out Which of Your Suppliers
Have Co-Op Funds Available
The suppliers of many of the products that you sell most likely have available
advertising funds that they’re happy to provide you — if you follow their
sometimes convoluted rules and go to the trouble to ask for it.
For example, I have one client who told me that, in his first ten years in 
business, he never applied for co-op advertising funds because he didn’t
know they existed. Not a single manufacturer from whom he was buying 
35
Chapter 3: Boosting Your Budget with Co-Op Programs

merchandise had bothered to tell him they had co-op funds available to aug-
ment his very limited ad budget. So what’s the moral to this story? If you
want co-op funds, you have to ask!
Look at all the brands you’re selling, read every factory invoice, calculate
what you’re spending with each of your suppliers, and go after them for ad
bucks. Chances are, at least some of the companies who supply you with
inventory have co-op or vendor dollars available. This section helps you get
the co-op ball rolling.
Knowing who to talk to
Each of the vendors who sell to your store has assigned a sales representa-
tive to work with you. These people visit you on a regular basis — of course
they do, they want to sell you stuff! These sales reps are a great place to start
the process of finding co-op funds. Even though they may not be inclined to
offer you information on co-op funds on their own (because of some bonus
arrangement they may have with their employers), they can definitely tell
you about them if you ask.
If you get a positive response from one or more of these sales reps, get the
lowdown on how you can go about collecting some of this money. Ask what
you need to do to qualify for funds, and what, if you do qualify, they require
you to do in order to receive a check. If the manufacturer’s rep tells you that
no co-op funds are available to you, press the issue and ask whether vendor
dollars are an option (which have no strings attached other than a few initial
qualifiers).
You may also want to talk to the marketing and/or advertising managers of
these suppliers. These people control the advertising funds (including co-op
money), which means you can get your answer straight from the horse’s
mouth. If the marketing or advertising manager says that the company doesn’t
offer co-op funds, show how smart you are by asking for vendor dollars. This
question definitely gets a marketing or advertising manager’s attention
because, chances are, he’s never mentioned these available dollars to
anyone.
If you’re working with an ad agency, ask your agent what her experience is
with businesses similar to yours, and where these other businesses may have
found co-op money. Agency people know where the bodies are buried, as they
say in the ad biz. I even know of one group of radio stations in my area that
has a co-op department for the express purpose of helping its direct advertis-
ers find money they may not otherwise have known was available to them. 
(Of course, the radio stations benefit from this found money, too, because the
companies spend that money advertising on their radio stations.)
36
Part I: Advertising 101 

One way or another, ask as many people as you can think of within the vari-
ous companies you deal with about co-op funds. Unless you’re selling some-
thing obscure like arts and crafts made by individuals, you’re likely to find
some hidden money somewhere.
You’ve found your funds, now 
how do you get the dough?
After you’ve located the funds you need, you must run an obstacle course on
your way to collecting them, providing all the proof the vendor requires that
you actually ran the ads (see the section “Understanding the Rules,
Regulations, and Restrictions” in this chapter). Then, and only then, will you
receive your co-op funds in some form or another.
Suppliers can pay co-op funds in strange and unusual ways, including, but
not limited to:
 Cash reimbursement
 Additional merchandise
 Discounts off future merchandise purchases
No matter what form of co-op payment you receive from any given supplier,
always keep one thing in mind: It’s found money — money you wouldn’t oth-
erwise have if you hadn’t gone to the trouble to ask for and earn it.
Understanding the Rules, Regulations,
and Restrictions
Each of your suppliers has a unique set of rules to which you must adhere in
order to collect even a dime of co-op funds from them. The rules and restric-
tions set up within co-op programs can be so complicated that you may
wonder whether these suppliers want anyone to even try to collect. But even
though the restrictions can be a bit off-putting, if you follow the rules to the
letter, your suppliers will reward you with either some extra cash to invest in
advertising or some additional merchandise with which you can make a big,
fat profit. All in all, the pain is worth the gain.
37
Chapter 3: Boosting Your Budget with Co-Op Programs

If you work with an ad agency, it may be able to help you navigate the rules
and regulations. For example, my agency deals with several clients who count
on co-op advertising funds to either augment or completely provide their
advertising budgets. Because these accounts have hired my agency, we do all
the work of collecting the funds for them. It’s one of the services we provide,
and we do it month after month for multiple accounts (each with different
rules of collection). Collecting co-op funds can be time-consuming, but if you
know the rules and follow them, you can do it without much trouble.
When you’re working on your own, without an agency, you need to do the leg-
work yourself. In the following sections, I walk you through the process of
using co-op funds — and collecting your money.
Co-op funds may be earned (and accrued) over a specific period of time and
carry with them a deadline for use. This deadline is known as “Use it or lose
it.” Make sure you find out about any deadlines imposed by manufacturers on
the use of their available co-op advertising funds, and be sure to spend the
money before it disappears.
Getting your ads preapproved
Manufacturers don’t just hand out co-op money as if it were candy. You can
contact a manufacturer about a potential co-op ad campaign, or a manufac-
turer may contact you and suggest one. But before you can begin to spend
any co-op money (no matter whose idea it was), you must get your ads
preapproved by the manufacturer you’re working with.
Suppose you own a paint store. One of your major manufacturers has told you
that it will co-op an advertising campaign to sell 1,000 gallons of Putrid Peach
paint it has lying around. Your supplier tells you that, if you contribute some
of your ad bucks (you pick the amount you think you’ll need to dispose of this
paint within a reasonable amount of time), it’ll match you 100 percent up to
$5,000. Your total ad budget could, therefore, be $10,000 — more than enough
to buy some local radio time and a couple of big ads in the newspaper.
Your next step is to get your ads preapproved by the manufacturer. In most
cases, your supplier requires you to have all your advertising preapproved
by the factory to make sure it adheres to the manufacturer’s co-op guidelines.
Your supplier may have an approval form for you to fill out. Along with this
completed form, you must submit copies of radio scripts, a CD or MP3 file of
the final produced commercial(s), and at least a rough layout (plus a copy of
the final, finished copy) for your newspaper ads. (Be sure to ask what your
38
Part I: Advertising 101 

manufacturer requires for various mediums.) Then the manufacturer’s adver-
tising or marketing department either sends you a stamped approval as is or
advises you to make certain changes. The department may also simply
advise you of the required changes and stamp and sign the approval
“Approved with changes.” Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s co-op rules
and guidelines carefully, making whatever changes they request.
Never run co-op advertising without first obtaining signed preapproval from
the supplier.
Obtaining proof of performance
After you’ve made the manufacturer’s requested changes to your ads (if there
were any), you need to make sure to get what’s called proof of performance
from the media, which is really just verification that you ran the ads as you
said you would.
To return to the paint store example from the preceding section, when you
buy your ads from the radio station, advise them that you’re using co-op
funds (they usually know precisely what information you need). Make sure
you receive the following verifications and co-op information with the sta-
tion’s invoices:
 A notarized copy of your finished script listing the number of spots
run and the total dollar amount those spots represented in your total
media buy. If you’re using more than one script, each script needs to be
notarized with the above information.
 A notarized or certified invoice listing the run times of each spot, the
title of the script for each spot, and the total dollar amount of the buy.
Advise the newspaper how many tear sheets you need to provide for the man-
ufacturer (tear sheets are copies of the actual printed page on which your ad
appeared — the manufacturer lets you know how many you need to provide
as proof of performance). The newspaper provides those tear sheets along
with its notarized total invoice. (For more on newspaper ads, check out
Chapter 7.)
The media you’re working with should know what your manufacturer needs
as proof, but if not, be sure to ask the manufacturer. The proof of perfor-
mance looks different for every medium.
39
Chapter 3: Boosting Your Budget with Co-Op Programs

Submitting your co-op claims package
After your ads have run and your campaign is attracting customers in droves,
all you need to do is submit your co-op claims package. Your package
includes your preapproval form, your proofs of performance, and a written
request for reimbursement of the promised percentage of the campaign.
Continuing with the paint store example from the beginning of this section,
imagine that you’ve made the requested changes, the ads run, the campaign
is a success, and hundreds of people with questionable color sense fight their
way through your doors. The Putrid Peach paint is history. Now you just
submit the entire package — the signed preapproval form, the notarized
media invoices, the notarized radio scripts, the CD or MP3 file of the finished
radio spots, and the newspaper tear sheets — to your supplier along with
your written request for reimbursement.
There. Wasn’t that simple? Now all you need to do is wait for the co-op check
to arrive in the mail. And, what’s the bonus to all of this hoopla? You got rid
of that disgusting paint color!

Advertising cooperatives: Not the same 
as co-op funds
Advertising cooperatives are a different beast
altogether. Unlike co-op funds, advertising
cooperatives cost you money. But it may be the
best money you ever spend, because you enjoy
high-quality production and your fair share of
the clout of a substantial combined media
budget.
Advertising cooperatives (also known as dealer
ad groups) are common in the franchising busi-
ness and the automotive business. The fran-
chise business discovered a long time ago that
it can do a much better job at advertising if it
asked each of its franchisees to pony up a per-
centage of gross sales, which then goes into a
“war chest” where it accumulates until enough
cash is available to do a large-scale media buy
for all the franchises together. An individual
store can’t hope to do advertising on a scale to
match the combined budgets of many stores.
Strength in numbers is the name of the game.
The advertising cooperative also uses its money
to employ the services of an ad agency that pro-
duces top-quality TV, radio, and print advertis-
ing, as well as in-store, point-of-purchase
display materials, and, in the case of food fran-
chises, menus, banners, bags, and so on. If
you’re in a business that can take advantage of
the media buying power and quality production
provided by an advertising cooperative, be sure
to get involved. Your business will most likely
benefit.

Defining and Positioning 
Your Message
In This Chapter
 Knowing what customers want in your business, product, or service — and providing it
 Pinpointing what you want to say
 Devising a campaign that knocks their socks off
W
ith a limited advertising budget, your product, service, or company
name isn’t on the tip of the national tongue, nor are people from New
York to Los Angeles whistling your jingle. But you can define your strengths
and position your advertising message in such a way that you give yourself
the best possible chance for success. And with 50 percent of all new busi-
nesses going under within the first two years, you want to do everything you
can to improve these rather daunting odds for your business.
When you first opened your business, you probably felt confident in doing so
because you were convinced you could provide better service, a more unique
line of products, and more creative solutions to consumers’ problems than
they could find anywhere else. You found an attractive, convenient location;
stocked up on really cool merchandise or offered a really distinctive service;
expanded your business hours for better customer convenience; and have
been enjoying at least the first blush of the success that usually follows a
well-thought-out business plan. To paraphrase mass-production genius Henry
Kaiser (whose ship-building division, during World War II, built one new
Liberty Ship every day), “You found a need and filled it.” But now you need to
take it one step further with an advertising campaign that brings in more cus-
tomers, adds more dollars to your bottom line, and validates all the reasons
you went into business in the first place.
In this chapter, I fill you in on a few of the key factors that customers use
when they choose one business over another — factors you want to keep in
mind when you come up with ways to advertise your business’s strengths.
Then I walk you through the process of positioning your message, where you
let your customers know exactly why they should buy from you. Finally, I end
the chapter by outlining the basics of coming up with an effective ad cam-
paign, using a real-life example from my own business as a guide.

Understanding Why People Choose One
Product or Service over Another
As you devise your positioning strategy and, ultimately, your advertising
message, you need to keep in mind why people choose one product or ser-
vice over another. That way, you can help to ensure that they choose your
product or service over your competition’s. In the following sections, I cover
some of the main reasons people choose one product (or service or company
or store) over another.
Image is everything
People drive or walk long distances past one fast-food restaurant, service sta-
tion, doughnut store, or hair salon in order to patronize another because the
image of the store they seek out is more in tune with their own tastes and
desires. Image, as they say, is everything.
When it comes to image, peer pressure (or what you think the rest of the
world is doing) also comes into play. People want to project the right image,
and often, they do that by choosing the product, service, or store that they
think helps them do so. For example, if dozens of people are working out at
one particular gym in town, their friends may also try that gym because
“everyone else is doing it.” Price, quality, convenience, and many other fac-
tors come into play, but if that gym’s image is the one that the customers can
best identify with, then it most certainly gets the most business.
Your business’s good reputation for customer service, fair value, good prices,
and after-sale concern and care also goes a long way toward ensuring your
success. If you can honestly say that you provide the very best of any of
these virtues, broadcast it widely.
You’ve got personality!
Customers often choose one business over another based on the personality
of the business. And that, of course, begins with you and the people who
work for you. For example, I’ve become a regular at a very good Italian
restaurant in my hometown for the simple reason that the personality of the
place (and of the people who work there) suits me to a T. It has just the right
combination of location, ambience, menu choices, and friendly, caring man-
agement and staff to have won my undying loyalty.
42
Part I: Advertising 101 

A half-dozen outstanding Italian restaurants are all within a six-block walk of
the one I frequent, and my wife and I have tried them all. But we visit the
same one quite often because, from the moment we walk through the door
until we waddle out a few hours later, each employee treats us like visiting
royalty, whose continued satisfaction and patronage is a very high priority.
Everyone, from the bartender to the waiter to the busboy, makes us feel not
only welcome, but at home.
So if you own a restaurant and want to advertise your establishment’s unique
personality, you can use a headline such as, “Like having dinner at Mama’s,
but without all the kids.” If you’re a car dealer and want to tell your cus-
tomers that they can find something unusual during their service appoint-
ment, you can say, “Put your feet up, have a cup of gourmet coffee, catch up
on the soaps, and relax in our customer lounge.” In other words, if you truly
believe that your business has a sparkling personality and offers certain ben-
efits that customers can’t find elsewhere, then find a creative way to use
these strengths in your advertising. Then be sure you deliver on the promise
after the customers arrive. Don’t call attention to something that isn’t really
there, something that you don’t — or can’t — really offer.
Convenience: More than location
The top three factors in getting rich on real estate are: location, location,
location. The same may be true of your store or business. Convenience can
be a huge incentive to customers. But when I say convenience, I’m not just
talking about location. Convenience may be ample free parking within a few
feet of your door, or easy freeway access, or a well-thought-out store design
so your customers can get in and out quickly, or a store policy of always help-
ing customers load merchandise into their cars, or a service policy of always
delivering on time.
If you do have a convenient, available location with great parking and a bright
and cheerful ambience, easy access, an easy store layout, or any number of
conveniences that customers find attractive, include this information in your
advertising message. Convenience is also a very simple and effective way to
differentiate your store from other, less-convenient, less-attractive stores.
For example, when I need hardware items, I patronize a small local store,
instead of one of those big discount warehouses, because of the convenience
factor. The store is small (it would fit into one corner of one of the large chain
stores, and you’d never even know it was there) so I can quickly find what I
need and be on my way. It also has a large parking lot right outside its back
door. I know I could save a lot of money if I went to the chain stores, but I’m
willing to pay for the convenience of the mom-and-pop.
43
Chapter 4: Defining and Positioning Your Message

If I were the owner of this small hardware store, I’d advertise with messages
such as, “Park within 20 feet of our door. You may pay a few pennies more for
nails, but think of the money you’ll save on shoe leather!” Or, “Is saving a
nickel on nails worth getting hammered in a parking lot?” Or, “Drive for miles,
search three acres for a parking place, get lost in a huge labyrinth, save 50
cents. Can we talk?”
Similarly, if I owned a service business, such as a car and limo service, I’d
advertise with a message such as, “Don’t stress about getting to the airport
on time — call us instead! We’ll pick you up on time and get you to where
you’re going, in the comfort of one of our luxury cars, driven by our safe and
professional drivers.”
Don’t sacrifice service!
Service, in my estimation, is the most overused and under-delivered promise
made in advertising today. Just about every business claims to deliver the
very best in “service,” or “customer service,” or “customer care,” but in real-
ity, hardly any business actually does provide great service. Most market
research shows that what customers want most from their bank, supermar-
ket, dry cleaner, car dealer, shoe repair shop, accountant, or whatever, is
good, old-fashioned service. All businesses know this, but most businesses
seem totally incapable of delivering it.
My agency handles a local Audi dealer that lives and dies by the results of
factory-sponsored telephone surveys it does following every new car sale
and every service appointment. The results of these customer satisfaction
surveys go a long way in determining this car dealer’s relationship with the
factory and with how many cars it allots him each month. He ranks very
highly in his survey results, and we advertise the fact that his dealership is
top-rated in customer service. And this advertising focus on service (as well
as fair pricing and a wide choice of inventory) is obviously working — this
dealer, located in San Jose, California, sells so many new Audi cars that he’s
now number two in the nation.
If you use service as a reason for customers to try you out, then you’d better
deliver the goods. If you can’t service your customers in an efficient, courte-
ous, timely manner, or deliver, replace, or repair what you promised when
you promised it, then don’t tell customers you can. Don’t make any promises
you can’t keep, because people will soon see through you and your promises
like a piece of cellophane.
44
Part I: Advertising 101 

Let ’em know your uniqueness
A certain way to attract customers (more certain than anything else I know)
is to offer something they can’t get anywhere else. If you’ve stocked your
store with creative, hard-to-find items that other stores simply don’t carry,
then you are way ahead of the game. If your doughnut store can state for cer-
tain that your doughnut holes are smaller (and, therefore, your doughnuts
are more substantial) than a doughnut junkie can hope to find elsewhere,
then that is your message. If you carry truly unique greeting cards in your sta-
tionery store, cards that aren’t available anywhere except at your location,
then people looking for such an item are sure to respond.
Of course, if you’re selling the idea that your business is unique, you need 
to work overtime to assure that it remains so. Do you remember when
Starbucks was the only place where you could get gourmet coffees? It didn’t
take long for hundreds of imitators to come along and make the same claim. If
you’re successful in positioning yourself as totally unique, you can be sure
that others will copy you — and you’ll have to continually reinvent yourself
to stay ahead of the competition.
The price is right
In some (but not all) cases, advertising the manufacturer’s suggested retail
price (that’s the MSRP you hear about on car commercials all the time) is
helpful. In the automobile example, where a dealer typically sells cars for less
than the MSRP, the dealer looks very good. But in the case of a candy bar, for
example, where the MSRP is 50 cents, but the big chain stores sell it for 40
cents, and the airport gift shop sells it for a dollar, you find customers
scratching their heads and wondering what the heck the real price is on this
candy.
Be very careful when using price or terms as reasons for customers to visit
your store. When you advertise price, you run the risk of getting caught in
what I call the price trap. If you’re only selling price, you have to continue to
lower that price — or come up with even better terms — on an ongoing basis
in order to continue to attract new customers.
For example, the cell phone business has fallen into the price trap. When you
look in the newspaper, you may have a tough time choosing a wireless phone
company or deciphering the best available bargain because you have to sift
through the various stores’ offers of free minutes, free phones, free long-
distance, free mobile-to-mobile calling, and any number of price and terms
offers. And all of these stores have to continually create new and better offers
in order to compete.
45
Chapter 4: Defining and Positioning Your Message

Researching and Assessing 
Your Competition: What Sets 
Your Product Apart?
Creating an ad campaign is a big step that can cost you some serious money,
so it deserves some very careful planning. Before you get into the actual
process of designing your advertising campaign, however, you need to iden-
tify and promote the specifics that make your product or service unique,
known in the ad world as your unique selling proposition (USP).
Your advertising should never speak in generalities. Including just your busi-
ness’s name, location, and all the wonderful things you’re selling isn’t
enough. You need to give the consumer a very good reason — or better yet,
several good reasons — to visit you. You do this by first identifying your dis-
tinctive strengths and then calling attention to those strengths in your ads.
This process is called positioning your message.
Determining the key reasons why consumers drive (or surf, if you’re online)
right on past other stores, that may sell the same merchandise as you do, in
order to seek out your store is the first step in identifying your USP and posi-
tioning your message. You need to convince consumers that your store or
business is the smartest, best, most-logical place that they can ever hope to
buy that merchandise or service. After you identify these keys, focus in on
them as the basis for your creative advertising message — in other words,
promote and publicize your strengths.
46
Part I: Advertising 101 
You can’t be all things to all people
As you define and position your advertising
message, be careful not to over-promise.
Promising a level of service you can’t deliver, or
a convenient location that isn’t, or low prices
when yours aren’t really all that low, can be a
deadly mistake. Be honest with yourself about
what is really unique and desirable about your
store or business, and then be honest when you
start making claims about it.
On the other hand, don’t panic because you
can’t deliver the very best of everything. Maybe
your prices really aren’t any cheaper than those
of your competition, but your business is
located so conveniently, or has such a great
ambience and personality, or carries such a
unique inventory, that you’re confident people
only have to try you once in order to become
loyal, happy regulars. If that’s the case, then
when you’re designing your ads, don’t make up
false benefits based on price — position your
message to exploit your strengths, namely that
perfect location with all that free parking and all
the friendly, cheerful faces waiting inside.
Remember: One good promise on which you
can truly deliver is better than trying to be all
things to all people.

A good way to start the process of advertising your strengths is to let your
mind wander backward to recapture all the reasons you were convinced 
that your business would succeed in first place. Ask yourself the following
questions:
 What makes your company special?
 What is unique about your inventory (if your business is a store or
you’re selling products)?
 What service do you provide that clients can’t find elsewhere?
 Are your business hours more expanded than the competition’s?
 Is your location easier to find? More convenient? With better parking?
Or, do you pick up and deliver directly to your customers?
If you can remember what it was that originally motivated you to start your
business, you’re halfway home in identifying what motivates customers to
seek you out. The same reasons you were enthusiastic enough about your
business plan to take the entrepreneurial plunge translate nicely into a cre-
ative concept and motivational copy that drives customers to your business
(turn to Part II for more information on how to do this in each ad medium).

A unique selling proposition 
successfully exploited
One of my agency’s clients owns a chain of fur-
niture stores. These stores aren’t your everyday,
garden-variety furniture stores featuring living
room, bedroom, and family room items. Oh no,
they are some of the only stores in the entire
San Francisco Bay Area that carry a huge
inventory of hard-to-find dinette sets and bar
stools. Although most furniture stores carry
some of these items (usually hidden way back
in the corner of the showroom), this guy has
hundreds of styles of dinettes and a huge inven-
tory of hard-to-find bar stools and home bars.
His showrooms are cavernous, and when he
has a floor sample clearance sale (which he
runs twice yearly), customers beat down his
doors. His repeat business percentage is
astounding, thanks to his complete dedication
to customer service.
His advertising hits hard at what he calls casual
dining furniture, which he has available in more
styles than a customer could possibly find at
any other store, and in price ranges to suit any
budget. In fact, casual dining furniture is all he
does. And he originally opened his stores with
this limited, but unique inventory in mind. So he
uses this unique selling proposition in his adver-
tising with great success. This guy truly does
have something unique to sell, which makes
writing his ads all the easier.

Don’t confuse your potential customers with too much information — inform
them with a well-conceived, creatively executed, and carefully positioned
message. Don’t try to sell everything you have in the store (or every service
you offer) in a single ad. Doing so only causes sensory overload. Zero in on
one or two important, relevant items so your customers have a prayer of
understanding your message.
You want to position your message keeping in mind not only your business’s
strengths, but also your primary market (in other words, the people who are
most likely to buy your product). When you take both of these important fac-
tors into consideration, you not only position the resulting message, but you
also target it — like a bull’s-eye, so you can then take your best shot.
Developing a Strategy for Your
Advertising Campaign
After you’ve identified the many good reasons people would be foolish not to
shop at your store, or to utilize the unique services you provide, and assum-
ing you know your market and to whom you want to sell, you’re ready to
move forward with planning your ad campaign. You know why you’re selling
what you’re selling, you know whom you’re selling to, and you’re now armed
with the information you need to create wonderful and memorable ads. This
is the fun part.
Of course, it’s fantastic if you can run a sustained radio and TV campaign;
buy flashy, full-page print ads; slap your message up on dozens of billboards
and buses; and do a major-league mailing to every zip code within a mile of
your store, all at the same time. But that kind of ad campaign — one that
covers all the bases — is very costly. Assuming you don’t have unlimited
advertising funds, you need to get a bit more creative with your message and
your spending. And that process begins with two questions:
 What can you afford?
 What media best targets your primary market segment?
Regardless of how much you spend or where you spend it, you need to make
sure your ads cut through the clutter of advertising messages that bombard
your customers every day. Focus your message in a clear and creative way so
that your ads attract the attention of, and motivate the largest possible
number of, your primary market.
For example, if your business is a boutique selling women’s clothes, cosmet-
ics, or jewelry, and you’re targeting women between the ages of 25 and 54,
you want to write and design your ads using words, phrases, and graphics
that appeal mostly to them — for example:
48
Part I: Advertising 101 

 Use words like savings, sale, and free.
 Include phrases like “New fall colors and styles,” “Free gift with every pur-
chase,” “Buy one, get one free,” and “Hurry in today for best selection.”
 Add graphics to print ads and mailers to illustrate in a clean, uncluttered
fashion what you’re selling.
You also want to place your ads with media that give you the best chance at
reaching these women in quantity. For example, if you’re buying radio time,
select those stations that can prove to you that its audience composition is
heavy on your primary demo (women between the ages of 25 and 54).
Obviously, running your spots on a teeny-bopper station that plays only teen-
pop icons isn’t wise (regardless of what the radio time salesperson tells you
about the station’s audience composition). For print, place your ads in the
newspaper’s main news, local news, entertainment, gardening, and society
sections. You may not want to place your print ads for this market in the
sports section of the paper. (Yes, women read the sports pages, but not in the
numbers that men do.)
Above all, no matter who your audience is, you want to include in your ads
enough creativity and content so your ads are not only heard and seen, but
also understood and remembered. And where you place your ads is every bit
as important as what you say in them.
Case Study: Advertising a Chain of
Women’s Plus-Size Clothing Stores
Using the target demo of women in the 25 to 54 age bracket (from the previ-
ous section) as an example, here’s how I went about designing and executing
an ad campaign for a northern California chain of women’s stores. My client’s
product was plus-size clothing, which, of course, is very visual — a customer
needs to see it in order to get interested in it. And stylish, attractive clothing
in plus-sizes is often hard to find. So I leaned toward TV as the primary media
to buy right away. I also figured that, when the stores had specific sales, I
would add newspaper ads, but primarily to advertise price. The television
ads would establish the store name in the minds of the store’s target audi-
ence, and the newspaper ads — when they had really great markdowns and
discounts to advertise — would serve them well in augmenting the TV spots.
Although this client did have a dozen stores throughout the area, he didn’t
have a budget substantial enough to be on the air or in the paper every day.
So, when designing the campaign, I had to consider that each of the spots
would need to include all the relevant information a customer needs about
the stores. In other words, he couldn’t do what the major clothing chains 
do — namely, use a spot showing all the hot new fashions and end the spot
49
Chapter 4: Defining and Positioning Your Message

with just a logo and company slogan, assuming that everyone already knows
his stores and where they are. I had to pretty much start from scratch and do
the whole sales pitch within each commercial. Each commercial needed to
stand on its own.
What my agency did to sell women’s specialty fashions on a budget is what
you need to do — sit down and plan your work, and then work your plan. It’s
a step-by-step process that, when done right, usually produces excellent
results. I cover the steps of this approach and how we followed them in the
following sections.
Identifying the USP: The unique 
selling proposition
We began with the product (women’s specialty clothing) and the primary
target market (plus-size women between the ages of 25 and 54). This type of
clothing is sometimes difficult to find in the latest colors, patterns, and
styles, but our client’s stores offered an enormous inventory of flattering,
complimentary, up-to-date fashions in all varieties and in special sizes —
that’s its USP. After all, plenty of stores sell specialty clothing for women in
smaller sizes and, well, ordinary clothing in plus sizes, but not many stores
sell specialty clothing in plus sizes. This factor is what was unique about this
store, and we wanted to emphasize that in the ad campaign.
Moreover, the market for these fashions is substantial; it was really just a
matter of reaching the primary audience in sizeable numbers with a message
that was relevant, informative, and creatively presented. These stores truly
had what plus-size women were looking for; our job was simply to get the
news out there.
Knowing the budget — and staying 
within its limits
After we had identified the unique selling proposition, we added into the
equation the advertising budget, which, when compared to major clothing
chains, was extremely limited. However, knowing that these fashions didn’t
necessarily change with every season, we came up with some very visual, 
relatively inexpensive, TV spots that we could then run in flights (time seg-
ments) over a period of several years. Our production costs (the actual cost 
50
Part I: Advertising 101 

of filming and editing the commercials) were modest in comparison to the
quality of the final product, because we were willing to travel a few hundred
miles in order to employ the services of a not-so-big-time, but extremely tal-
ented, film company. And we also hired a wonderful group of plus-size
models who worked on a buy-out basis (with no residual payments, just a one-
time fee). It was a successful example of what you can do with just a bit of
planning and a dab of creativity.
Shooting the ads
For this campaign, I wrote several TV spots with an eye toward relatively
inexpensive production, hired some professional models, employed the ser-
vices of a truly remarkable film company in Sacramento, California, scouted
some locations, and headed to the state capitol to shoot some spots.
My agency produced three 30-second spots for under $20,000 (although this
figure may sound expensive, the client ran these same three spots for several
years, so they ended up being rather cheap). Then we put them on various
TV stations in flights. (Flighting is an ad-biz term that means, for instance,
buying advertising for two weeks at a time, then going off the air for two
weeks, then back on the air, and so forth.) The spots showed the models
wearing various dresses and separates and wandering around beautiful loca-
tions such as the mall, the zoo, and the park. We shot everything outside on
location (as opposed to in a studio) with 35-millimeter film, and the footage
was simply gorgeous.
The clothing this chain sold was very stylish and very unique, and the com-
mercials showed the merchandise beautifully. Because this clothing was
hard-to-find, and because the commercials did such an excellent job of
simply showing a wide variety of styles, the campaign was a very successful
one that we brought back, as though it were brand-new, about twice a year.
And I enjoyed a good relationship with the store owner until he finally
decided to retire.
Selecting the right media
We had created some wonderful television commercials showing our beauti-
ful fashions, and we needed to place those spots into TV programming that
would not only reach our primary demographic, but also would be affordable
within a limited media budget. Notice I said, TV programming, not stations.
51
Chapter 4: Defining and Positioning Your Message

How many times do you grab the remote and click to other stations while
you’re watching TV? You bounce all over the dial looking for programming
that appeals to you, don’t you? You don’t stay with one channel all day and
night out of loyalty (as you may do with radio). With that in mind, remember
this: When you’re buying television advertising time, don’t buy the channel,
buy the programming.
We placed our ads on programs — affordable programs — that attracted
women in large numbers: soaps, afternoon talk shows, early-morning and
afternoon news, game shows, and so on. Local and regional advertisers can
usually afford to buy advertising on these shows, whereas the prime-time
stuff is often out of reach of most small business’s budgets (although some
highly successful and well-watched game shows are affordable when com-
bined with a broader schedule that includes less desirable programming).
Applying these ideas to your ad campaign
These same rules (listed in the previous sections) apply to any and all products
or services. So, whether you’re selling hardware or fast food, cars or doughnuts,
ceiling fans or fashions, or whether you’re providing tax-preparation services,
home-improvement help, or computer troubleshooting, follow these guidelines
as you begin to design your advertising.
Look hard at what it is you’re selling and to whom you’re trying to sell it.
Identify and hammer home what makes your product or service unique, dif-
ferent from all your competition. Then, in the most creative, hard-hitting way
you can devise, create your ads to focus attention on your unique product
difference. Then you only need to place those ads in media that can bring
you the greatest return on your investment, media that reaches large num-
bers of your primary target demographic. It sounds simple, right? And it is.
This ain’t rocket science . . . it’s advertising, and you can do it just like any-
body else.

 Molding your campaign around your message
W
hether your advertising budget is a million dollars a month or only a
thousand dollars a year, you’ll waste that money if your ads aren’t
effective. What makes ads effective? A combination of content and creativity.
Your ads need to give the consumer a good reason to act (the content), and
they have to be unique enough in their design and copy to attract the con-
sumer’s attention in the first place (the creativity). Countless forms of media
expose consumers to so much advertising on a daily basis — some of it so
subtle that consumers don’t even know they’re absorbing it — that generat-
ing advertising for your business is a real challenge. However, your task isn’t
impossible — it just takes some serious thought. More serious than, say,
clear soda or Internet pop-ups.
Consumers constantly see and hear bad advertising that’s unclear in its mes-
sage, confusing in its content, and just plain aggravating in its production. On
the other hand, many forms of media expose them to some truly great adver-
tising that includes memorable graphics, killer copy delivered in a clear, con-
cise manner, and fresh, new creative hooks.
The good news is that you don’t need a huge ad budget in order to create
effective ads. Truly superior advertising is created every day, and much of it
on a budget. Sadly, in many cases, the people doing the bad advertising are
spending the most money.

You don’t have to create the next great advertising slogan — “Just do it” or
“With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good”— to get people to buy your
product, use your service, or come to your store. You just have to display a
bit more creativity than the other guys and devise a compelling message so
people choose you over your competition.
No matter your budget, audience, or vision, you can do good advertising, and
in this chapter, I show you how. I explain how you should hone in on and find
out as much as possible about your target audience — that’s marketing-speak
for the people you most want to attract as customers. I also advise getting to
know your competition — especially their advertising — so you can differen-
tiate yours from theirs. Finally, I describe what a creative hook is and how to
develop that creative hook in all your advertising, whether you’re doing TV
commercials, radio spots, Internet banners, outdoor ads, or newspaper or
magazine ads.
Identifying and Targeting Your Audience
To begin the creative process of finding your one-of-a-kind message, ask your-
self a few simple questions:
 What are you selling, and what makes it so unique?
For example, if you need to sell kids toys, what makes your merchandise
different from what people can buy from other big retail chains? Are the
toys handmade, imported from other countries, or vintage?
 To whom do you want to sell it?
In other words, who exactly are you targeting as your ideal consumer?
Parents, of course, but what type of parent? Do you want to target
wealthy, upscale parents, who are most interested in educational games
that will help their kids learn, for example? You may also think about
marketing to aunts, uncles, and grandparents, who often want to spend
more on their nieces, nephews, and grandchildren than the parents do.
 Why should people buy the product or service from you?
Are you open very late at night so that parents who work long hours can
drop by your store? Do you offer free delivery of large items so that
walk-in customers don’t have to lug your product home? Are you (and
your staff) especially knowledgeable and approachable about suggesting
great toys for different age groups?
These questions prove useful whether you’re selling toys or computer repair.
(Flip to the section “Concocting a Creative Hook to Get Your Audience’s
Attention” for a detailed example of the process of identifying and targeting
your audience.) When you have the answers to these questions, you should
do two things: Focus on your primary market and do your research.
54
Part I: Advertising 101 

Focus on your primary market
Many business owners fall into the trap of believing that their products or
services are “for everyone”— that is, anyone would be interested in or need
the products. After all, if you have kids, you need toys and kids’ clothes,
right? If you have a car, you need workers to service it. And if you don’t want
to prepare your own tax return, you need a tax whiz to do it for you. So, why
do the businesses that sell these products or services need to identify pri-
mary markets?
The answer is that, even if your business appeals to a broad market of
diverse consumers, you need to identify who your ideal consumer is. If you’re
selling expensive toys, for example, your primary market is wealthy parents
(even though, theoretically, any parent can save up to buy a special gift). If
you’re in the car repair business, you want to focus not only on what you do
best, but also on what segment of the market needs your business most (not
to mention what may be the most lucrative). For example, if you’re the only
business in town that knows how to repair foreign sports cars, and you
happen to live in a city or neighborhood that houses plenty of these, your pri-
mary market should be foreign car owners. That’s not to say that you’ll turn
away the driver of the Volkswagen if he needs a new transmission; the Jaguar
owner just needs your expertise more.
After you’ve identified your primary market, your advertising should match
that focus (see the section “Concocting a Creative Hook to Get Your
Audience’s Attention”).
Research your market
Knowing your target audience is critical: Your ads won’t work if they don’t
appeal to what your potential customers want or need. Research and find out
as much as possible about the people you want to sell to. For example, if you
run an independent bookstore (remember those?), it’s easier to sell books,
magazines, and newspapers to people who already read voraciously, so you
need to find those folks and figure out as much as you can about their read-
ing habits and preferences. If you’re selling running shoes, find out who the
avid athletes are in your community and how old they are, how often they
run, where they work out, who they listen to for advice on running gear, and
what they’re not getting from competing shoe stores.
Your market research can take many forms. If you oversee the advertising for
a new business (or you want to go after a new type of consumer for your
business), you can start by checking out some basic demographic informa-
tion. The best research comes from primary sources — in other words, you
should call around for information. For example, if your business is foreign-
car repair, you should find out how many foreign cars are in your city or 
55
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

community. The simplest way to find out is to check the Yellow Pages for
dealerships that sell foreign cars. Call those dealers and ask for information.
Let them know that you’re not interested in competing with them; you just
want to offer a service. They may be more than willing to give you the infor-
mation you want and to refer business to you.
Of course, you should first make sure that companies you call don’t offer sim-
ilar services, because then you would be competing with them!
You may also be able to find information in publications, which may track
demographics, sales information, trends in your industry, and other useful
consumer information. For example, an auto publication may track the
number of Jaguars sold in the United States and in specific regions or cities.
Finally, you can get some useful information from your potential customers,
especially those in your primary target market — that is, the people you
most want to buy from you. Conduct an informal poll by asking potential cus-
tomers what they’re looking for that other businesses don’t provide. In the
foreign-car example, you would contact people you know who own Jaguars or
Mercedes and ask them what type of service and price they’re interested in.
Similarly, if you’re opening a toy store, ask parents where they shop and why,
and find out what products, services, or price levels they wish they could find
at the stores they shop. You want to differentiate your business from your
competition (in a good way) by targeting customer needs and attracting busi-
ness! (See the following section for more on separating your business from
the competition.)
Checking Out Your Competition’s Ads 
so You Can Differentiate Yours
Before you develop your own ad campaign (you start the tangible process in
the section “Concocting a Creative Hook to Get Your Audience’s Attention”),
you should look at what your competition is already doing. You can learn so
much about your business and the market from your competition. Your goal
isn’t to be an Ad Thief; you want to determine how your business is different
and what you can offer and advertise to compete effectively with other play-
ers in your business.
For example, suppose your business is a garden center. You’re probably not
the first garden center to open in your community, so you should check out
how the other centers are advertising what they do best. (If you’re the first
center, you should start with the research I outline in the previous section.)
56
Part I: Advertising 101 

You may find that one of your competitors advertises “Colorful Garden Ideas”
and that its garden center is “The place to shop for all your gardening needs!”
(See Part II for different ways to get your message out.) Those ad headlines
tell you that the business is focusing on a broad selection of products, which
is fine; many gardeners will certainly be looking for a broad selection.
But maybe the strongest selling point of your business is that “You provide
helpful, friendly advice from knowledgeable, experienced gardeners!” Your
pitch will certainly appeal to many customers who have bought beautiful
plants or seedlings in the past, only to see them wither and die. In analyzing
how you differ from the competition, you’ve identified your primary market
(see the section “Focus on your primary market”): people who want to have a
garden but don’t know how to buy what’s best for their locations, light
sources, and the soil on their property. The helpful, friendly advice from
knowledgeable, experienced gardeners is really what you’re selling; it sepa-
rates your business from your competition.
To figure out how to transfer your knowledge of your target market into a
successful ad campaign, check out the section “Concocting a Creative Hook
to Get Your Audience’s Attention.”
Focusing on Ads That You 
Respond to Most
After you’ve researched your target market, analyzed your competition, and
found out how your business differs (from preceding section), you should
also review ads from other businesses (not in your industry) that appeal to
you. Looking at other businesses’ ads can help get your creative juices flow-
ing, so you can start developing ads for your business that will hopefully
appeal to your prospective customers.
Great advertising ideas are all around you, from the funny to the heart warm-
ing. Even though a magazine ad, newspaper ad, Internet ad, or radio or televi-
sion commercial features a product, service, or business that’s nothing like
yours (see Part II for discussions on advertising within these forms of media),
you can still get creative ideas from what you respond to.
I have the strongest response to ads that use humor. The humor appeals to
me, so I pay attention to what products the companies are advertising. And if
I’m in the market for such products, I’ll be more likely to remember the ads
because of the humor.
57
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

But you (and your primary market) may respond best to other types of ads.
For example, you may respond to straightforward descriptions of what the
product or service does — especially if humor isn’t appropriate in your busi-
ness (if you run a funeral home, for instance). In the same vein, you may
respond best to a simple picture, which can be worth more than a 1,000
words, as in the following examples:
 If you run an exercise center or a weight-loss service, or a hair salon that
specializes in highlights, you can use before-and-after photos to great
effect.
 If your business is food related (either a specialty store or a catering ser-
vice), you can feature pictures of truly mouth-watering, appetizing food.
 If you focus on anything creative — you design and make clothing or
knitwear, photo albums or picture frames, or furniture or cabinetry, for
example — you should consider showing pictures of your work.
 If you run an automotive body shop, you may want to show sequential
photos of how you brought it back to life — a prolonged before-and-
after, so to speak.
You should be your first resource when it comes to what advertising is 
appealing . . . but don’t stop there. Ask your family, friends, neighbors, and col-
leagues what appeals to them. This informal research is easy to do (and free!).
58
Part I: Advertising 101 
Hooking customers with humor
Here are some of my favorite recent ads from
the world of television. I remember these prod-
ucts because of the humor involved, which is
the goal of all funny ads:
 Nextel’s commercial that shows two corpo-
rate guys in suits dancing to funky music on
a tape player. A colleague interrupts them
angrily, demanding to know the status of the
company’s shipments; the guys stop danc-
ing, get the info via their technology, and
resume dancing as soon as they’ve pla-
cated their colleague.
 The sock puppet for Pets.com. The sock
puppet was the most popular purchase
from this ill-fated Web site, which went out
of business quickly because consumers
weren’t interested in buying pet food and
supplies over the Internet. (The makers of
the site obviously didn’t research their
market; see the section “Research your
market” for more info.)
 The talking sheep from Serta. The mattress
company wants to advertise the fact that its
mattresses are so comfortable that people
no longer need to count sheep. This is a
great creative hook to peak the interest of
consumers (see the section on creative
hooks). The company also decided to sell
sheep merchandise in addition to its mat-
tresses because consumers responded
favorably to the adorable “mascots.”
 The Swiffer ad featuring a woman dancing
around her neighbor’s home, cleaning
everything in sight, to the tune of “Whip it,”
a punk hit from the early 1980s.

You have one more resource that can help you develop a new ad campaign:
your old ad campaigns! In addition to checking out your direct competitors’
ads and looking at other business’s ads that appeal to you, review what
you’ve done in the past to see what worked and what didn’t (if you have that
information). If you find something that worked really well, you don’t need to
reinvent the wheel. On the other hand, if you need a fresh approach, at least
you’ll know what not to do!
Concocting a Creative Hook to Get 
Your Audience’s Attention
Because you want your advertising to stand head and shoulders above your
competition, you need to work hard at finding — or, if you prefer, inventing —
something that will grab the potential customers in your primary market (not
necessarily by the neck) and drag them into your store or motivate them to
call your business. A creative hook is an emotional trigger that attracts
buyers; it appeals to their self-image and affirms that you provide what
they’re looking for. A creative hook is what every good ad needs in order to
cut through the advertising clutter. The hook may be a slogan, a phrase, a
jingle, a single line of copy, or a unique look that appears in all your ads. But
whatever you choose, it must be yours and yours alone, because you’ll use it
across all media to differentiate your business from all the others. The
bottom line: You need to put a new spin on the same old message by coming
up with a memorable creative hook.
For example, the Energizer Bunny is a creative hook — it just keeps going and
going and going — and it appears in television, print, and in-store ads promot-
ing how long-lasting the Energizer batteries are. McDonald’s creative hook, at
one time, was its jingle, “You deserve a break today,” which was permanently
burned into the consumer memory. The minute you heard this jingle, you
instantly knew what the product was. And AAMCO Transmission used a horn
in its radio and TV spots as a creative hook; the horn even taught you how to
spell the company’s unusual name (“Double A, honk-honk, M-C-O”).
Creativity can take the form of copy content, the actors you use in television
commercials, the graphics you choose for print ads, an unusual musical back-
ground for radio spots, humor, or any number of things. Even though being
creative is often a strenuous task, finding a new twist that you can inject into
your ads is worth the extra effort. Just remember: Each ad must contain all
the information consumers need in order to make a thoughtful decision as to
whether they will act.
59
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

No matter the hook you choose, make sure it’s memorable and unique. You
can make the task of creating the hook easier with the help of colleagues and
peers. In the following pages, I show you the brainstorming ropes and include
an example of a marketing campaign that uses creativity and style to lure stu-
dents to a community college.
Creative brainstorming
So, how do you get creative? What secrets can you uncover that will trans-
form you from businessperson to creative genius? Unfortunately, I can’t offer
you a magic potion. But I can tell you that you can jump-start your creativity
by gathering a few friends, family members, or employees around and doing
what the professionals do: Hold a creative brainstorming session.

Part I: Advertising 101 
How a creative hook became an 
advertising phenomenon
When I first came up with the idea for the Pet
Rock, I envisioned it as a spoof of a dog-train-
ing manual. But in researching book publishers,
and then distributors, and then retailers, I soon
realized that trying to sell this highly unusual
concept as a book would be an uphill climb.
Plus, according to my research, the average
shelf life of the average book (at least one not
written by a big-name author) is just a matter of
weeks — if you can get it printed and onto the
shelves in the first place. That was unaccept-
able as far as I was concerned. Maybe, I
thought, Andre Gide was right when he said, “If
a young writer can refrain from writing, he
shouldn’t hesitate to do so.”
So, back to the old drawing board. I knew that
what I needed to find was a creative hook. And
my answer was that, instead of writing a book,
I’d create a product. I devised a way to package
The Official Pet Rock Training Manual, along
with an actual rock lying on a bed of excelsior
inside a miniature pet carrying case, complete
with air holes. This way, I could skip the book-
stores entirely and put the whole enchilada into
department stores and gift and stationery
stores. It was simply a better, more creative way
to sell the book.
When this innovation came to me and the pack-
aging was designed, the Pet Rock — the nov-
elty gift product that quickly became an instant
sensation — was born. The creative hook that
took the Pet Rock from paperback book to
upscale gift item was so subtle that it seemed
to go over the heads of many marketing experts,
who still think I had a lot of nerve selling rocks
for five bucks. I wasn’t selling rocks for five
bucks apiece (who in his right mind would pay
to buy a rock?); I was selling books.

Advertising agencies often hold creative sessions, or brainstorming sessions,
when they’re designing new campaigns (or redesigning old ones). In my
mind, these meetings are the most fun an ad person can have –– at least
while at work. (See Chapter 2 for more on ad agencies.)
You can always find a more creative, memorable, unique way with which to
get your message across. Your idea doesn’t need to be earth-shattering in its
creativity — just different, clever, and memorable enough to grab the eye or
ear of the consumers and motivate them to at least consider giving you a
shot. The trick, of course, is to find what that hook is for your business or
product.
Involving everyone in the brainstorming process
In a creative session, all the people who will be working on a particular
account — owners, creative directors, copywriters, artists, even the account
service people — gather in one room. You trade as much information as pos-
sible about the account, the product, and the primary market, and then you
begin tossing out ideas. The initial ideas beget more and more ideas, which
will, eventually, result in the perfect creative answer to the problem at hand.
The only rule in a brainstorming meeting is that no idea will be laughed at or
discarded out of hand. The session should be a stream-of-consciousness type
of gathering, and no idea is far-fetched or stupid. Every idea gets tossed onto
the table and considered.
Recording your brainstorming ideas
In creative sessions, when someone throws out an idea, a scribe should write
it in marker along with other ideas onto large sheets of paper (a cheap and
easy way to record your ideas; plus, you can keep the sheets for reference,
which you can’t do if you write on a blackboard or whiteboard). As the
sheets of paper fill up, your scribe should tape them to the walls. Before long,
the room will be festooned with ideas — good and bad — from wall to wall.
The entire group should study the ideas, and then refine, change, and resub-
mit them. Eventually, the creative hook — your new advertising message —
begins to take shape. And when everyone in attendance agrees that a certain
concept is the best answer to the problem, the group focuses on that superla-
tive idea and begins to massage it into the final product.
Creativity is hard work. Ideas don’t just jump up and bite you (although the
bad ones have some pretty gnarly teeth). You need to search for them very
diligently . . . but they will happen. I’ve gone into creative sessions with no
clue as to what we could come up with for a particular account, and I’ve
walked out armed with great, new ideas that we could ride for months to
come. The creative session is the two-heads-are-better-than-one approach —
a tried-and-true method of generating dozens of fresh, new ideas.

Creative example: Developing a campaign
for a community college
My advertising agency handles student-recruitment advertising for two Bay
Area community colleges in California. In order to devise a fresh, new cre-
ative approach for this account, we went through the following process 
(of which I go into more detail in the sections to follow):
1. We reviewed all the old advertising, from our campaigns and from the
competition’s campaigns.
2. We thought about what we were selling and what made these colleges
unique.
3. We figured out to whom we wanted to sell these college programs,
and why our target market should be interested in these particular
colleges — in other words, why our targeted students should “buy”
from the “product” these colleges were offering.
4. We came up with a creative hook for our new ad campaign.
5. We morphed our idea into a tangible campaign compatible for radio
and other media.
6. We reviewed the process and the results of our efforts.
Reviewing previous ad campaigns and the competitions’ ads
Our first step was to go back through all the colleges’ previous advertising
campaigns to see if we could identify any glaring flaws. We found the ads to
be . . . well . . . kind of boring. The ads just listed a bunch of facts and figures
(for example, which classes the colleges offered during certain enrollment
periods and how much those classes cost). They threw out their statistics in
the form of print and broadcast advertising and hoped for the best.
Unfortunately, the ads didn’t differentiate the colleges from the many other
junior colleges doing equally boring advertising (which we had checked out
as part of our research before creating a new campaign). As a result, our
client colleges’ advertising wasn’t getting very dramatic results, which is why
they came to us looking for something that would actually work.
Identifying the target market
To pinpoint your target market, you should apply the list of questions I pre-
sent in the section “Identifying and Targeting Your Audience.” In the following
list, I walk you through the various steps we took as an agency to produce
some new ads for the colleges — ads that have increased student enrollment
each and every time they’ve run:
62
Part I: Advertising 101 

First question: What are you selling, and what makes it so unique?
Answer: We’re selling a quality education delivered by highly qualified
instructors in a beautiful campus environment.
Second question: To whom do you want to sell it?
Answer: To kids fresh out of high school and to adults who want to
upgrade their current job skills or to return to the job market after an
absence.
Final question: Why should people buy it from you?
Final answer: Because, unlike so-called trade private technology
schools (which can be quite expensive) or four-year colleges (which can
be downright unaffordable), our community colleges deliver a first-rate
education, providing day, night, weekend, or Internet classes, for just $7
per credit hour to California residents.
Finding a creative hook for the new ad campaign
After answering the questions from the previous section about our target
market, my agency developed a radio soap opera with the authentic sound
and feel of the old-time radio soap operas that were all the rage before televi-
sion came along.
We used our creative hook to challenge listeners to bettering themselves by
becoming more educated, and we did it in a fun, nonthreatening way. But
wait, you say. What do teenagers know about old-time soap operas? Well,
nothing, but they responded to retro concepts, and what’s more retro than
old-time radio soap operas?
Developing the campaign on radio
For our college soap opera spots, we decided to turn to radio to spread our
message. My agency created imaginary people with imaginary problems and,
by using really corny organ music in the background (just like the good old
days) and a completely over-the-top actor to read the copy, we introduced
each character, his or her problem, and a solution achieved through a quality
education from one of our colleges. Here’s an example of the copy one of our
scripts directed at young adults:
Emily awoke to the big day. She had spent a year as mustard squirter
(squirt), then ketchup squirter (squirt, squirt), then pickle placer (one,
two, three). But today, at the pinnacle of fast-food success, she would
occupy the drive-through window (. . . and did you want fries with that?).
This was big, she thought, really big. But after a day spent watching other
young women cruising through in BMWs, gabbing away on their cell
phones, Emily knew that what she needed was a career, not a job.
Especially not this job. No education, no career. No career, no BMW.
63
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

Simple, huh? She called Silicon Valley’s winning education combo —
Foothill and De Anza Colleges (music change, upbeat, jazzy). With day,
evening, and weekend classes, as well as Internet and telecourses avail-
able, Emily could get top-quality instruction for just seven bucks a unit.
Foothill and De Anza offer an affordable way to earn a college degree or
to update job skills for today’s competitive job market. Do what Emily

“We want to buy your friendship”
One of the other partners in an agency of which
I was a part owner made a presentation to intro-
duce our agency to a small, regional bank — a
bank that was having a terrible time competing
with the monolithic California financial institu-
tions like Wells Fargo and Bank of America. As
creative director, I was invited to attend a get-
acquainted session with the bank’s flamboyant
president. This guy was way ahead of his time.
He sported a closely cropped beard and always
wore his signature bright-red suspenders
(which he proudly showed off by strolling
around the bank without his jacket). He was, to
say the least, unlike any bank officer I had 
ever met.
Located in a small regional strip mall in a Bay
Area suburb, the bank had come up with a very
generous interest rate on savings accounts as a
way to attract new deposits. The trick we had
to deal with was to tell potential customers
about the bank’s rate and other good reasons to
move money there — and to do so within the
parameters of a somewhat limited ad budget.
Because the president was such an unusual
character, a guy who truly humanized the bank-
ing experience, my best idea was to feature him
in all the ads.
Coming up with a great, new idea is one thing. In
the ad-agency biz, getting clients to agree to the
more far-fetched ideas is quite another. In this
case, the bank president was just egotistical
(and creative) enough to see the logic in, and to
go along with, the new headline I invented for
his bank, which was (I change his and the
bank’s names here), “John Smith, president of
Regional Bank, wants to buy your friendship!”
Instead of droning on about the bank and its
higher interest rate on money market savings
accounts, and then adding all the caveats and
details about minimum balances, I thought we
should go straight to the heart of the matter. We
would tell potential customers that, although
John Smith was being a bit mercenary in
attracting deposits with a promise of a higher
interest rate, he didn’t take himself too seriously,
and Regional may actually be a fun place to
bank.
We did a photo shoot of John wearing his sus-
penders and used it in all our print ads and in-
lobby display materials. We even designed and
silk-screened T-shirts with red suspenders in
the front and back, featuring the slogan “John
Smith Bought My Friendship” and the bank’s
logo. We also did a series of radio spots (which
we ran on economically priced regional sta-
tions) in which we went way over the top to
explain that Regional was totally different from
any other bank.
An off-the-wall strategy, you say? Exactly. And
it worked. The bank took in savings-account
deposits at a very satisfying clip. This campaign
proves that, even if your business is less 
than exciting, you can write and produce eye-
catching (and ear-catching) ads with just a little
creativity.

In addition to creating a series of spots directed at teenagers fresh out of high
school, we invented other characters and wrote spots directed at adults
stuck in go-nowhere, low-paying jobs or eager to return to the job market
after long absences — adults in need of an upgrade in skills. We placed our
commercials on radio stations specifically programmed to attract our prime
audience — everyone from young adults between the ages of 18 and 24, to
women between the ages of 25 and 54, or to adults in general. (For more on
creating radio advertising, see Chapter 8.)
Assessing the results of the new campaign
The results of our new campaign were more than gratifying. Our clients
entered the new radio commercials into various community college creative
advertising contests and took several first prizes. More important, enroll-
ments at both colleges went up and our clients remain happy. What more
could you want from an ad campaign?
An added bonus is that our spots were very cheap to produce. The most
expensive element of the whole campaign was the cost of the actor, who did
a superb job of reading (or, I should say, emoting) the copy. All in all, we
devised a creative campaign that left most of the client’s money available to
spend where it would do the most good — on radio stations with strong audi-
ences of prospective students (also known as buyers). For information on
how to advertise on a budget, check out Chapter 2.
Incorporating Your Creative Message 
into an Overall Media Ad Campaign
When a great new idea hits you right between the eyes and the light bulb of
creativity suddenly shines brightly, you need to begin incorporating your
message into a full-blown ad campaign (or at least as full-blown an ad cam-
paign as you can afford). After you identify all the ways your product is
unique and put your finger on a hard-to-resist, eminently logical reason that
people should seek you out in order to buy it (see the previous sections of
this chapter), you need to find ways to make your idea fit into various forms
of advertising.
Often, your creative hook dictates what media you should use — the hook lit-
erally drives your campaign:
 If your hook is visual, you’ll use print, collateral (such as mailers,
brochures, and so on), and/or television media.
 If your concept is audio-driven (a skit between two people or a hook that
uses your own voice or a unique music background, for example), radio
may be your best bet.
65
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

 If your clever new idea is a catchy slogan or a headline, you can con-
sider using any variety of media, including billboards and bus cards.
You can’t buy a 50-pound ad campaign with a 10-pound budget, so you need
to pick and choose your media and adjust your message accordingly. See
Chapter 2 for more on working within your budget.
The good thing is that you don’t need to buy every media outlet in town in
order to get your message across. You can accomplish your goals not only
with a creative message, but also with a creative media buy. So, before you
start designing your campaign, you need to come to grips with how your
message will translate into various media and how much of this media you
can afford. The following sections show you the way and give you tips for
delivering your message in an effective, concise, and affordable manner.
Ensuring consistency of your message 
in all media you choose
Whatever your unique message turns out to be — whether it’s a headline,
sentence, slogan, graphic, or other creative hook — be sure to use that mes-
sage consistently in all media. You need to apply the same message in all the
forms of media you use in order to establish it as yours and yours alone and
in order to give the consumer a better chance of remembering it. For exam-
ple, if your radio commercials talk about a half-price sale on a specific item,
your newspaper ads should feature the same sale terms for the same item.
Many small businesses (and a surprising number of large, national advertis-
ers) make the mistake of being inconsistent, and it only serves to confuse the
consumer and to water down the overall advertising impact (and budget).
The good thing about maintaining consistency from one medium to the next
is that translating your message is even easier. If you spend hours and hours
writing a 60-second radio script for an ad, and you decide to augment your
radio advertising with some small newspaper ads, your time isn’t lost. In fact,
your job is all but finished, because you can easily edit the same copy you
wrote for radio so that it works for print, thereby creating a cohesive adver-
tising message across both forms of media. One good piece of advertising
copy always leads to another as your campaign begins to take shape.
Keeping your message simple
The real challenge of creating your advertising is to devise a hook that will
cut through the clutter that consumers are exposed to each and every day.
For example, a really clever, creative two-column newspaper ad with a head-
line that reaches out and grabs your attention can stand head and shoulders
66
Part I: Advertising 101 

above a full-page, four-color ad that completely misses the mark. Similarly, a
radio spot that takes a fresh approach will enjoy much more listener recall
than a spot that drones on and on without giving the listener a clear reason
to actually hear it.
The best rule you can use as you work toward creating memorable advertis-
ing for today’s marketplace is summarized in an acronym you won’t forget:
KISS, which stands for “Keep it simple, stupid.”
Why is keeping it simple so important? Because today, more than ever before,
consumers are deluged with information. Many people are connected to the
outside world every minute of the day. Computers, cell phones, Blackberries
and other personal digital assistants (PDAs), the Internet, radios, television,
and many other electronic devices keep people within reach of information.
The amount of data available is overwhelming, and the media throws adver-
tising into this cauldron of information. At the very least, you hope your ads
will be noticed; in a perfect world, consumers will remember them and act on
what they hear. The key to igniting consumer memory is keeping it simple.
Consumers choose to shop at a particular store when dozens of stores carry
essentially the same products because they’re captured by an ad that gives
them a clear, concise reason to buy — an idea presented in an eye-catching,
creative way. Perhaps they desire a great low price, a special that includes a
free gift, a discount on future purchases, or any number of things. Whatever
the consumers desire, an ad grabbed their attention, and they responded.
And, whatever the ad was, I’m willing to bet that the company presented it in
a very simple, easy-to-understand manner.
Using words that sell
Certain words and phrases, when used in advertising, have a better-than-ever
chance of attracting consumers’ attention. You see these words over and
over again in ads, but their overuse is a direct result of their effectiveness.
Different words or phrases work for different types of businesses, though.
Here are some examples of words and phrases that sell in the retail industry:
 Clearance
 Discount
 Everything must go
 Final closeout
 Free
 Going out of business
 Grand opening
67
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

 Improved
 Markdown
 New
 Overstocked
 Sale
If ever you needed to use the KISS rule in full-force (see the previous section),
it’s in the vocabulary you use in your ads. The challenge lies in walking a 
fine line between using simple, easy-to-grasp words and phrases and writing
the way people think (in everyday conversational English). Bottom line: 
Make your ads simple in their language but creative in their content and 
presentation.
If you offer a service instead of providing a product, many of the words from
the previous list still work. “Free,” for example, always gets consumers’ atten-
tion, as does “new.” The following appealing words and phrases, however, are
specific to the service industry:
 Great service
 Free pickup and delivery
 On time
 Trial offer
 Professional
 Family owned and operated
 Guaranteed service
 Money saving
 Dependable (or reliable)
 High quality
 References available from satisfied customers
Go through your newspaper and look at the ads. Certain words and phrases
used by most advertisers will quickly become apparent to you. Now you
know what I mean when I say that these words sell. They form a similar
thread that runs through most advertising. If you can use any of these words
and phrases in your advertising, by all means include them. If they’re good
enough for the other advertisers in your area, they’ll most certainly be good
enough for you.
68
Part I: Advertising 101 

Just as some words really sell, others should scare you off like a rat in a
restaurant. Don’t use swear words or most slang. And, in general, don’t use
words with more than three syllables. You can use some four-syllable words
(like incredible and absolutely, as in “absolutely incredible savings!”), but be
careful. Keep in mind that most people haven’t expanded their vocabularies
since high school (which is why most newspapers are written to the sixth-
grade reading level).
There are exceptions to these rules, if done creatively. For example,
Budweiser created ads some years back that used the word “Whassup,” and
the ads were fun and memorable.
Delivering your message with clarity
No matter what form of media you use for your message (see Part II for more
info on the types of media), be sure to explain your message in clear, easy-to-
understand terms. You want consumers to see at a glance what you’re selling
and then make snap decisions as to whether they want to read or listen 
further.
Place your most powerful selling message at the beginning of a radio spot or
in the form of a headline for printed advertising or Internet banner ads.
For example, if you’re having a two-for-one sale, you want to get that informa-
tion out there right away. Don’t drone on for half a radio spot without giving
the listeners a reason to actually hear it. Get down to the nitty-gritty and then
explain the various details.
Here are two examples of opening copy for a radio spot to advertise a two-
for-one sale. See if you can tell which spot is better:
Smith’s Hardware, conveniently located in the Neighborhood Shopping
Center, a family owned and operated business for over 50 years, and a
store where you’ve come to expect the very best in top-quality merchan-
dise and friendly, helpful service, is proud to announce its annual two-for-
one sale!
Announcing the annual two-for-one sale at Smith’s Hardware — the sale
you’ve been waiting for since last year. Buy one gallon of paint, get
another gallon absolutely free!
69
Chapter 5: Forming an Effective Ad Campaign

Both examples include similar information. The difference is that the second
example gets the most important point across immediately; the rest of the 60
seconds can be filled with the specifics about convenient location, store his-
tory, and other good reasons to visit. The first example may put listeners to
sleep within the first couple of lines. Nothing in the first spot makes con-
sumers want to listen.
Following the same rule in a print ad simply means that two-for-one sale
becomes the headline, with all the other information the consumer needs to
know placed beneath it (as briefly and succinctly as possible). In this case,
the two-for-one sale is the creative hook, because it’s the single element of
the ad that separates it from other ads for similar stores (see the section
“Concocting a Creative Hook to Get Your Audience’s Attention” for more on
creative hooks).

 Determining whether online advertising is meant for your business
 Creating an easy-to-use, informative Web site
 Making sure current and prospective customers know about your Web site
 Determining your online advertising goals
 Using banner ads and e-mail effectively
You’ve worked to build your business, and now you’re wondering, do you
need a Web site? The answer is yes, you probably do — especially if your
goal is to expand your business. Most consumers have access to computers,
even if they don’t have one at home — and they’re quick to use the Internet
for research (though older consumers are still a little behind the curve). For
many people, a business isn’t real unless it has a Web site. When I need a
product or service, I check the Internet even before I open my phone book. It’s
fast and easy, so a business with a Web site is more likely to attract my atten-
tion. Having a simple but well-thought-out site is a great, inexpensive way to
advertise your business — even if you don’t plan to sell online right away.
In this chapter, I walk you through the steps along the Web site pathway,
answering some common questions as I go. What makes a Web site good? If
you build it, will they come? Is it easier and cheaper to hire a Web designer?
The dirty, little secret is that creating a good Web site isn’t as hard as techni-
cal people may have you believe — if you know what you want and are willing
to commit some cash. The first step is making the decision to do it.

Of course, having your own Web site is just the door (or portal, if you will) 
to online advertising. You should also consider advertising your business on
other Web sites, so the second half of this chapter describes those options:
creating banner ads and doing e-mail advertising.
The real question is this: Is a poorly executed Web site better than no site at
all? Stated simply, the answer is a resounding no! In many cases, a Web site is
the first impression a customer has — and everyone knows the importance
of good first impressions. A poorly designed Web site with inaccurate infor-
mation or spelling errors strikes a blow to a business image. If you build a
Web site, make it a good one. In this chapter, I show you how.
Measuring the Pros and Cons 
of Online Advertising
Just like any other advertising medium, online advertising has pros and cons.
Here are a few of the advantages to using online advertising:
 You can easily test the market. If you create a brochure, you have to
print and distribute it before finding out whether your campaign is effec-
tive. Response (or lack of response) on the Internet is lightning fast. You
can also add a counter to your company’s Web site to see how many
people visit your site.
 The ad campaign is less expensive. Because you don’t have the costs
associated with reprinting and redistribution (as you do in a more tradi-
tional campaign), the overall expense of a change is decreased.
 The ad works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It’s
always nice to know your advertising is working for you around the
clock and around the world, so that your customers can view it at their
convenience rather than any specific time.
 You can change your online ad much more easily than you can change
ads in other media. When you need to alter your online ad, no printing
or taping is required. Just change the HTML that created the online ad
and you’re done in a matter of minutes.
 Your customers can see your ad, shop, and buy, (if you sell your 
goods online) all without leaving home. It’s hard to beat that sort 
of convenience.
 You can target your audience effectively. The trick is to place your ad
where the right customers can see it. If you sell exotic teas, you want to
place your ad on a site that sells crumpets or cookies, rather than a site
that sells motorcycle equipment to bikers. Think like one of your own
customers by trying to imagine which sites they’re likely to visit. Those
sites are where to place your ad.
74
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Although some techies may find it hard to believe, you do have to consider
some disadvantages to online advertising, including the following:
 It’s too measurable. You can gather more statistics than a baseball 
team. Worse, some of the click-through rates (the number of times people
click on the ad divided by the total number of times people see an ad)
are low — often 1 or 2 percent or even less. That means hardly anyone
who sees your ad clicks on it and visits your Web site — or buys your
product. Online advertising is still in its infancy.
A few years ago, advertisers believed that increasing the number of
people who saw an ad would increase the likelihood of a sale. The think-
ing was that thousands of eyeballs looking at an ad would translate into
hundreds of sales. Not necessarily so. A bit later, everyone decided that
increasing your click-through rate would increase the number of sales.
But that wasn’t entirely true either. Currently, advertisers think that the
only real measurement of an ad’s success is to count the number of
people who actually buy a product. The point is that because people
don’t really understand what works yet, they collect every possible sta-
tistic. But not all statistics are useful. As of this writing, nobody knows
for certain which statistics will prove to be the most valuable.
 Some major ad agencies (and Wall Street) are losing confidence in
online advertising. The Internet is still so new that the advertising
world simply doesn’t know yet which advertising methods work best.
You do have, however, some good news. Few deny that in the future
some form of Internet ads (perhaps combined with TV) will be both
powerful and effective. People are figuring it out fast.
 Customers are experiencing advertising overload. One problem with
online ads is the incredible amount of clutter on most Web pages. Every
advertiser wants consumer attention, but readers simply have too much
information to digest. Often, they choose to ignore ads — and that is
what leads to low rates of return.
Even with its disadvantages, the Internet is turning into a tool that surpasses
the wildest dreams of ad execs. The radio took 38 years to reach 50 million
users. Television took 13 years to reach 50 million viewers. And the Internet
took just 5 years to reach the same number of users — a stupendous 
achievement.
The Internet is a social technology. As your site grows, you can offer chat
rooms and e-mail newsletters (not to mention a plethora of other options).
Electronic groups are effective and fun as well. People like a sense of commu-
nity, and the Internet offers that. In the end, all that interactivity means that
you can sell people what they want and not just what is left over in stock.
That’s not just good — it’s right. Happy, engaged customers are the Heisman
Trophy of the advertising world.
75
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

Creating Your Own Web Site
For many businesses, setting up a Web site is the first step toward online
advertising. Before you dive into the Web world, though, take a few minutes
to consider what you want out of a Web site, and what a Web site can do for
you. Here are some of the advantages that Web sites bring:
 A Web site improves your image. Face it — just about everyone in busi-
ness has a site. If you don’t, you want to make sure you’ve intentionally
chosen not to do so, and be sure your reasons are sound.
 A Web site can help your business — and your customer list —
expand. When you have a Web site, anywhere people have access to 
the Internet, they can have access to your business. Your customers 
are no longer limited to the people in your neighborhood.
 A Web site can reduce some costs. You can put information on your
Web site that you may normally put in an expensive brochure. People
who visit your site can get information quickly, and you save printing
and mailing costs. Everybody wins.
 A Web site is available around the clock (and the calendar!). Your Web
site works for you even when you’re sick or on vacation. When your cus-
tomers want to buy, your Web site is there to take their orders or receive
their questions, which you can then answer when you’re online — or
you can include answers to “Frequently Asked Questions” on your Web
site, which customers can peruse at their convenience.
 A Web site offers customers a choice. They can reach you in person
and by phone, fax, e-mail, and now via your Web site. Offering more
choices puts the customer in control.
Now that you’re sold on the advantages of a Web site, take a few minutes to
consider the following drawbacks as well:
 Sometimes having a Web site gives visitors the impression that they’re
able to buy online. If you don’t have an online store, some visitors may
be disappointed.
 If you include an online store in your Web site, many customers are
not willing to send their credit card information over the Internet.
Some people still fear being ripped off. Others prefer shopping in
person; they like to see products before they buy, to judge their value.
 Having a Web site doesn’t ensure success. You have to work for suc-
cess on the Web as hard as you work for it in your traditional store.
76
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Deciding on your Web site goals
Establishing goals for your Web site is essential. (How else can you tell
whether you’re succeeding?) Start by imagining your site in general terms. 
Do you want to amuse visitors? Then your Web site should be catchy and fun.
Are you trying to persuade people to support a political cause? Maybe you
want serious articles with just a dash of humor in the cartoons. Do you want
people to hire your investment firm? You may want to highlight your creden-
tials in a professional, understated Web site.
Think small. Why? Because it keeps the costs down, and because keeping a
site small allows for intelligent growth.
Most people create business Web sites for one of three reasons — to offer
information; to offer some form of interactivity, such as e-mail or customer
support; or to offer a full-blown online store.
Visit the sites of your competitors. What do you like and dislike? What do
they offer? How can you make your site different from and better than theirs?
Make a list of competitor services and add to it the things that can make your
site more valuable to the customer.
When you’re setting goals for your Web site, ask yourself these questions:
 How big do you want your site? With a larger site, with many pages,
you should consider tools that allow people to search your site with
ease to find what they need. Unless you have a very large business
already, go with a smaller site that can grow with your business.
 How soon do you want your site up and running? Hiring a Web
designer can add weeks to your schedule, so planning ahead is smart. 
A word to the wise: Not hiring a Web designer can add months to the
schedule, unless you’re already a competent designer. Just be sure to
put a limit on the amount you’re willing to spend (you don’t want your
designer to get carried away).
 What audience do you want to reach? If you sell rock music, your 
site will, and should, look a lot different than if you’re selling flowers.
Does your audience have access to the latest technology or is it reluc-
tant to try anything flashy? Prepare a list of what your customers want.
What is important to them? Don’t give them what you want. Give them
what they want.

Chapter 6: Online Advertising

If you choose to create an online store at your Web site, keep in mind that
customers want exactly the same things they want in a traditional store. 
They want to locate goods easily. They want decent prices and quality 
merchandise that’s in stock. They want to get in and get out as quickly 
as possible. Oh, and customers want service, including guarantees and the 
ability to return what they don’t want. Your customers must trust you, or
they won’t buy.
Choosing an effective domain name
Your domain name is a very important part of your Web site’s success. If 
you choose a name that’s catchy and easy to remember, your customers will
come back time and time again. If the name is long or hard to remember, they
may forget about it before they even get there.
In general, when you’re choosing a domain name for your Web site, pick one
that’s directly tied to your business. For example, if your business name is
Main Street Flower Shop, you could try MainStreetFlowers.com.
Keep in mind that domain names are a very hot commodity. People snatch
them up all the time, so the name you want may already have been taken by
someone else. Check out www.register.com, where you can search for the
domain name you want and see whether it’s available. (If it is, you can even
go ahead and register for it on the Web site and choose various packages to
get your own Web site up and running.)
Saving money (or your sanity): 
Your Web design
Doing your own Web site design can save you lots of money, if you already
have the skills. Are you a good graphical designer? Do you know how to
transfer that knowledge to the computer? Do you understand HTML (hyper-
text markup language — the language used to display stuff on the Internet)?
Do you know how to create interesting content? Can you take all your beauti-
ful pages and put them on the Internet? Well, then, doing it yourself is the
best choice for you.
For the rest of us, only two choices are left: using templates or hiring a Web
designer. In the following sections, you can explore these two options.
78
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

If you’re interested in finding out more about Web site design, check out
Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 8th Edition, by Bud E. Smith and Arthur
Bebak (Wiley).
Using a template
A template is a boilerplate pattern that produces a certain type of finished
product. Using templates in your Web design lowers costs and ensures 
consistency throughout the Web site. A Web site template may include such
items as a menu, buttons to pass from one page to another, graphics, and
sample pages that you can customize. It may have a template to describe
your company history, the items you’re selling, or special services you offer.
Before using a template, consider two issues:
 Templates can provide professional-appearing pages, but you must
use only those choices available in the package. In other words, if you
want individuality, templates aren’t the right choice.
 Many templates take time to figure out. Templates may be cheaper
than a designer in terms of cash layout but costly in terms of time.
You can get templates from some ISPs (Internet service providers), and you
can also buy them from Web-design vendors.
Hiring a Web designer
If you don’t have the skills and don’t want to get the training now, or if you
want a professional and personalized site online quickly, then hiring a Web
designer is a good way to go. It’s also usually — although not always — the
most expensive alternative. Chapter 12 provides more information on how 
to find and choose a Web designer and on shopping for the right ISP to run
your site.
Designing a strong Web site
If you decide to go the route of having a Web site for your business, you need
to know what makes a site successful. Three qualities of excellent Web sites
stand out above the rest. Your Web site must do the following:
 Have a clear of purpose. People go online to accomplish some purpose.
The best sites enable people to get what they want quickly. You may be
astonished at the number of commercial Web sites that don’t explain
their own purpose to a visitor. Customers want to know: Are you selling
something? If so, what? Are you offering information? Fine, where is it?
79
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

Often, you can clarify your reason for existence with a simple tagline
under your company name or logo (for example, “Margie’s Muffins —
Selling pastries to discriminating palates”).
 Be easy to navigate. Easy navigation requires a thoughtful plan, but the
extra effort pays off. People become impatient when they click endlessly
and never seem to get where they want to be. You can help them by
offering no more than a few choices per page. Divide your home page
into broad but easily understood categories such as “Products we sell,”
“Frequently asked questions,” “Press releases,” and “How to contact us.”
A customer who gets lost on your site is a customer who won’t return.
 Portray the image you most want to communicate. Your Web site
should carry the same image you portray in all other aspects of adver-
tising your business. Get your logo out front. Project an image that
reflects the goals of your business. And get your selling message out
there immediately — the customer doesn’t have time to be teased.
Although these three qualities may seem simple on paper, carrying through
with them can be much more difficult. Often, advertisers know what they
want to do on their Web sites, but they don’t have a clue about how to do it. 
If that advertiser is you, you can benefit from checking out the following 
sections, where I give practical advice on how to get what you want out of
your Web site.
Expressing your message clearly
A person who arrives at your site is interested not only in knowing what you
do, but also in what you can do for him. Tell each visitor what benefits you
offer — don’t make him guess.
Use short paragraphs. Not only are short paragraphs attractive, but few
people enjoy wading through an intimidating document full of big blocks of
text. Prioritize your content. Put your most important and timely information
at the top. Step up and be bold about the most exciting content.
Think of each person who arrives at your site as your one and only customer.
Don’t make him do all the work. Keep it simple. Avoid confusion.
Focusing on content
Content is the single most-important reason people visit a site — they want
information. Give it to them freely. Offer something of value.
80
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Here are some guidelines to making your Web content first-class:
 Omit needless words. That’s what Strunk and White said years ago (in
The Elements of Style [Longman]), and it’s still terrific advice today. All
content should have a reason to be on your page, so get rid of fluff.
 Stay current. Customers love knowing the latest tips and the most cur-
rent information, and they’re more likely to return to a site when they’re
fairly certain the content changes regularly. The best sites clearly state
when and how often the Web site content is updated.
 Highlight what’s going on with your business. Have a Web page
devoted to press releases. If you don’t have any, write some, or hire a
local writer to whip up a few for you. Then you can e-mail them to news-
papers and put them on your Web site. A press release helps reporters
find out exactly what you do. Put your newsletters on your Web site, too.
 Say it visually. Visual clues are helpful in communicating time-sensitive
information to your audience. If your site features articles on a certain
topic, make sure the date is displayed prominently. You may want to
post a red arrow next to new information to alert the consumer. You
don’t want to be flashy (using blinking neon lights, for example), but you
can use bold colors with discretion. Good sites also often have an area
called “What’s New.” That’s a good spot to highlight promotional infor-
mation or future events.
Making your site a door, not a window
You want your site to be inviting (like the reception area or lobby of your
own business), instead of chaotic or confusing, which only creates a slew 
of window shoppers (who rarely come in to buy). In order to create an
appealing Web site, consider some of the following suggestions:
 Offer a visitor no more than four or five choices. When visitors arrive
at a site, they immediately try to make sense of it. But they stop trying 
if they have more than a handful of choices on a single page. Let them
know the point of your site right away. Invite a customer in.
 Don’t make any single page too long. A page is too long if people have
to scroll down to find relevant information. If you have a lot of informa-
tion to share, split it up and put a healthy chunk of information on each
page. Each page of content should contain a single conceptual nugget of
information. Not six nuggets — one. Clearly, some exceptions to this
guideline exist, but on the whole, a single page of information is a rea-
sonable goal.
 Check and recheck your spelling and grammar. You want your site 
to reflect your business’s competence and professionalism. Botching 
the nitty-gritty grammar stuff can be quite the turn-off to many potential
customers.
81
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

 Be consistent. Carry a theme throughout your site. Make sure each page
has the same background and the same buttons to help visitors navigate
your site.
 Choose a solid background. A one-color background is simply easier 
to read than if you have wild graphics floating behind your text — no
matter how subtle you think they may be! You should also keep in mind,
though, that dark words on a dark background will also be tough for
people to read, so make sure the colors you use complement each other
well. Look at other sites to find what you think is easy to read. Finally,
the colors on your site can look different depending on the software
people use. Ask your friends to view your site to make sure it’s attractive
on other software.
I learned a lesson the hard way about trying too hard to impress people.
Once I designed a cool background for a friend, and it looked great on my
machine with my software. I took it to her home, put it on her computer, 
and was appalled. My beautiful dark blue background looked garish and 
ugly on her machine. Different Internet browsers display colors differently, 
so beware.
Cutting down on graphics and audio
Visitors want fast-loading pages, and graphics slow things down consider-
ably. So every graphic on your Web site must earn its place. Is it worth the
extra time it takes to load? Using the newest new thing isn’t always the
smartest smart thing. Some people still don’t have fast Internet connections.
Others don’t want to buy all the software necessary to display graphics and
audio and movies. Make your page one that loads quickly.
What is a fast-loading page? One that appears in just a few seconds. Bear 
in mind that some people do have broadband, cable, and DSL connections
and enjoy sophisticated graphics. So design your site for the appropriate
audience.
Be careful before adding audio to a site. Many people don’t like having music
blare at them unless they choose to listen. Some people surf the Web in their
cubicles at work. They (and their bosses) aren’t happy if loud noises sud-
denly scream out. So skip the audio unless it’s important to your business —
if you sell music, for example, or speech-recognition software. And always
offer a visitor the choice of whether to listen or not.
Making it easy to contact you
You may be surprised at how many sites forget this simple piece of wisdom:
Make it simple for customers to find you. Sprinkle your phone number,
address, e-mail information, business hours, and so on throughout your site.
82
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Also add a link to your homepage saying, “Contact Us.” When readers click
on that link, make sure all your contact information is available for viewing.
Remember: You’re advertising your business, so do it well.
Tell your customers how you can support their needs. Can buyers send
e-mail to you? Should they call? Do you have a toll-free number? Reassure
customers that you’re a real business.
Also, ask your local chamber of commerce to have a link to your Web site.
Reporters look at city pages to see what’s new and interesting from a local
angle. If your site is there, they’re more likely to visit it. Finally, make it easy
for reporters to contact you. Have your phone number and address promi-
nently displayed on your Web site. Some businesses even have a special
phone number for reporters to call for an interview.
Maintaining and updating your site
A good site has links that work. Clicking on a link only to find yourself on a
page that says, “Information not found” or “Site under construction” is just
plain annoying. Having broken links can damage your reputation and give
customers a reason to question your ability to provide whatever service
you’re promoting. Remember that the work on a Web site doesn’t end when
the page is placed on the Internet. Keep your links and all other information
accurate and up to date.
Promoting Your Site
If you build it, will they come? Having a Web site does no good if nobody can
find it. You can promote your site in a couple ways — online promotion and
offline advertising. And you need to do both to get the word out. In the follow-
ing sections, you can figure out how to do just that.
Online promotion
A search engine (or directory) is a tool (such as Yahoo! or AltaVista) for
combing the billions of Internet pages to find the information you need. One
problem with search engines is that they’re so incredibly thorough. Even the
simplest search can return millions of hits (sites that fit your search criteria).
Another problem is that no single search engine covers the entire Web. That
means you can receive different answers to the same question on different
search engines. You can view that as an annoyance or as an opportunity. I
choose the latter outlook, because it gives me more chances to succeed —
to get my site listed in such a way that anyone can find it.
83
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

Don’t worry about getting your site listed on more than eight or nine search
engines. Almost everybody has a favorite search engine anyway, and people
aren’t going to check 47 search engines to find you. Each person may check
one or maybe two of the major engines, so don’t bother with the little ones.
Each engine ranks sites using different criteria — and those criteria change
frequently. The formula used by the search engines to rank sites is highly
secret, but some common elements never change. Search engines rank sites
high in any given category if the site follows a set of rules. This ranking
system is why finding a Web site developer who understands how to optimize
your site for the search engines is so important. If you run a furniture store
specializing in antiques, you want people to be able to look under the words
furniture and antique and antique furniture and have your business appear
near the top of the list. A good Web designer can make sure this happens.
To make it easy on your Web site developer, tell him to optimize only for the
following search engines and directories: AltaVista, Excite, Google, Lycos,
webCrawler, and Yahoo! Search engines take six to eight weeks to index new
sites, so you have to be patient. Make sure that your Web site developer sub-
mits your URL (web address) as soon as possible to decrease the wait.
84
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Gleaning wisdom from Goldilocks: Web sites
should be just the right size, too
People hate clicking and clicking and clicking
while never seeming to arrive anywhere useful.
They will stay on your site if you give them the
information they want within a few clicks. Never
force anyone to work too hard to find what they
want.
A piece of magic is involved in creating a good
Web site, and it’s this: People are just like
Goldilocks — they don’t want too much infor-
mation on a page, and they don’t want too little.
They want just the right amount.
How do you know the right amount? Observe
yourself or your kids surfing the Internet. What
makes you impatient? Slow-loading graphics
and long, dull pages, I bet. On the other hand, if
the pages don’t contain enough information,
you’re forced to click too often. You don’t want
that either. Visit other sites to develop a sixth
sense about what is too much and too little.
Finding the right amount isn’t a riddle that tech-
nology can solve; it calls for common sense and
clear thinking. A good general guideline to
shoot for is no more than three clicks before
viewers find what they’re looking for.

Curious about the costs attached to buying key words on search engines?
Feel free to flip over to Chapter 12.
Offline promotion
You can do a lot offline to let people know you have a Web site, too. Put your
URL on everything: brochures, business cards, direct mail, newspaper ads,
radio and TV commercials, stationery, t-shirts, pens, tiepins, magnetic refrig-
erator stickers, your storefront sign, even your answering machine or voice
mail message — in other words, everywhere you would put your phone
number or street address. It’s just as important to your business’s success.
Give people a reason to visit your site. Offer something free, whether it be
information about an amazing diet or a free t-shirt. Most people who see your
URL on a billboard won’t rush home to view your site unless something is in
it for them. Offer convenience. Offer online ordering. Offer something.
Setting Goals for Online Ads
The Internet has sped things up, but the basic rules of good advertising
haven’t changed. Whether you’re first or last to market, you need to sustain
the basics to succeed — customer service, communication, commitment.
Personalized service just about always leads to happy customers. Amazon.
com greets consumers by name and offers reading and video suggestions tai-
lored to the individual. People love the notion that someone is looking after
their needs and interests.
The first step is to determine your own online advertising direction. Speaking
generally, you can choose from three strategies in an online effort:
 Branding campaigns, in which the goal is to get people to recognize
your product or company name
 Click-through campaigns, in which you get people to click on your ad in
order to be taken to your Web site
 Sell-through campaigns, in which you get people to buy right away
You can design different banners depending on your goals — the same
banner just won’t work for all three strategies. Choose one goal per banner
so that you meet your objectives. Use a good mix of the three campaigns,
which I describe in detail in the following sections.
85
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

Ads that build awareness
Branding means getting people to recognize your name (in a positive way, 
of course). The idea is that if someone sees your name enough times, he’ll
remember it later when he thinks about purchasing. For example, a person
seeing an ad on TV for a certain type of toilet paper doesn’t leap out of his
chair and rush to the store. But he may remember the brand some day when
he’s in the store. The same is true for Internet ads.
A recent study shows that the primary reason for advertising on the Internet
has, in fact, shifted toward branding — and away from Web site traffic-build-
ing and sales generation. This strategy makes a lot of sense when you realize
that sales resistance is strong when a user is intent on buying something else.
The drawback to advertising for branding purposes is that the success of a
campaign is difficult (if not impossible) to measure. Because of this, some
companies decide that branding-type banners aren’t for them. But I think
that’s a mistake, because your competitors are out there with their online ads
building brand awareness. It’s a mistake because branding — whether online
or offline — takes time. If you don’t make an effort to impress your name on
visitors, you lose valuable weeks and months. A person online has thousands
of choices, and you want that person to remember your name. The only way
to do that is to get it out there.
Ads that encourage click-through
Click-through simply means that when a user sees your ad, he clicks on it and
is taken directly to your Web site. When a user clicks through to your site, it
means that your ad was so compelling that the user stopped what he was
doing on another site and went to visit yours. That’s powerful stuff.
The purpose of a click-through campaign is to build traffic to your Web 
site. One excellent way to think about that is to remember headlines in 
a newspaper. Headlines don’t tell you the whole story; they just tell you
enough to pique your interest. That’s exactly the goal of a click-through 
campaign: to generate enough interest that your viewers click on your ad 
and visit your site.
Selling your product is one obvious goal of click-through campaigns (before 
a customer buys, she has to get over to your site). Another reason may be
Web-traffic generation. Perhaps you’ve sold advertising space to another
company, and you’ve promised that a certain number of visitors will go to
your site. Click-through campaigns are also effective if your plan is to build a
86
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

database of individuals to whom you plan to sell your product in the future.
Many businesses currently build such a consumer list by asking people for
their e-mail addresses. This list is the best sort of customer database,
because everyone on the list has asked to be there.
Ads that encourage sales
The point of a sell-through campaign (or one that encourages sales) is to drive
a sale immediately. Suppose you see an ad for an office supply discount site,
and that ad promises useful items on sale for remarkable prices. If you visit
that site and buy only the items on sale . . . well, that’s a sell-through ad that
didn’t work. The goal is to get you to go to the site, shop around, and buy
something else in addition to the sale items. More than that, the ad was prob-
ably designed to encourage you to become a regular customer.
To induce a purchase in a sell-through campaign, you have to offer an extra-
ordinary bargain, which is known as a loss leader. Sell-through campaigns are
appropriate when you want to generate revenue in a hurry. You may think
sell-through ads are the only ones worth having, but they really are a short-
term strategy, because they require you to always offer amazing sales. Think
twice before you settle on this as your one-and-only ad campaign.
Choosing Among Online Ad Formats
In the dim, dark online past (a decade ago), your Web site was your ad —
your only ad. Not much was actually sold online, but an Internet presence
gave a certain cachet. Businesses placed their sites into the search engines,
people came because it was cool, and if they liked what they saw, they called
or visited your brick-and-mortar store and bought goods in the traditional
way. Web sites in those days tended to be brochureware — a simple conver-
sion of product information to language that a Web site could display. No ani-
mation, no rich media, nothing. Plain vanilla. But it didn’t work very well,
largely because customers faced choices that bewildered them and because
Web sites couldn’t target the right customers.
Here’s a piece of trivia for you: The first banner ad appeared on Hotwired.
com in October of 1994 — it was an ad by AT&T. Hotwired wondered what 
the response would be from visitors to its site, and, to its surprise, it didn’t
receive a single complaint. Banner ads were born. Shortly thereafter, some-
one realized that you could advertise effectively by sending e-mail to people
who wanted to know about your products. Electronic newsletters appeared
out of nowhere, and a second form of online advertising hit the big time.
87
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

You can find other ad models for online advertising, but banner ads and
e-mail are the main ones you need to understand. I cover them in more detail
in the following sections.
Creating banner ads
Placing a banner or button (a small banner ad) on someone else’s site offers
two benefits: It drives visitors to your site, and it gives your product or com-
pany visibility on the Web. Banner ads are helpful in building brand recogni-
tion. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (www.iab.net) provides guidelines
for different sizes and styles of banners, buttons, skyscrapers (which are
essentially vertical banners), and other formats. Figure 6-1 contains an exam-
ple of an effective internet banner ad.
In the following sections, I describe the characteristics of a good banner ad
(you don’t want to create a bad one, do you?) and give you some pointers on
how to find a banner designer if you decide you don’t want to do this yourself.
Knowing what makes a banner good
One thing advertisers have figured out is that rich-media banners (ones that
have graphics with audio, video, and other technology components beyond
mere animation) work well. They’re simply more interesting than static ban-
ners — ones that don’t have all these extra features. Rich-media banners also
take a long time to load (appear on the screen), so you don’t want the
designer of your banner to pile huge amounts of technology into one little ad.
If you choose to go with a rich-media banner, be sure the interactivity (the
bells and whistles) are related somehow to what you’re selling.
88
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Online advertising guidelines
Here are a few common-sense guidelines as
you advertise online: Be truthful. Don’t mislead
consumers. Substantiate your claims. Be fair to
consumers. Make necessary disclosures clear
and conspicuous.
For example, if your banner ad promises a 
free dinner at Charlie’s Steak House, you must
mention — within the banner — that the pur-
chase of two airline tickets to Florida is neces-
sary before the free dinner is awarded. You
can’t force someone to click to your site before
knowing that a purchase is involved in the
“free” dinner. If you offer a free dinner (or some
other giveaway) on your Web site, you must
place the disclosure close to the offer. You can’t
make someone scroll down endlessly only to
discover that she must buy something first;
place the disclosure nearby. Make sure the dis-
closure is clear and easily understood.

You can drive traffic to your site with cheap tricks, but doing so is unfair.
Recently, a certain company designed a banner that looked very much like
the error message you receive just before your computer crashes. “Click
here,” said the ad. People clicked. Many of them thought they had to click or
their machine would crash. Instead, they were taken to the Web site of that
company. I’m not prepared to say their intention was dishonest, but that idea
resulted in a trick that made people feel foolish. My advice is to sell honestly.
Determining the quality of a banner depends largely on which ad strategy
you have chosen. You want a different sort of banner depending on whether
your goal is branding, building Web traffic, or selling. If your goal is to build
brand awareness, you want something attractive and catchy so people will
remember. You want your company name and/or product prominently dis-
played. You want something simple and short. Find a good slogan so that
your ad pops out of the Web clutter.
If you’re aiming at a click-through campaign (that is, you want to drive traffic
to your site but not necessarily to make an immediate sale), you want to
pique interest fairly. You can, for example, put up a banner that advertises
free dinners, and in doing so, you can have a phenomenal click-through rate.
Millions will visit your site, but that’s one of those cheap tricks — unless
you’re actually prepared to give free dinners to everyone who visits your site.
Figure 6-2 shows an example of a Web page containing a simple yet effective
click ad.
Figure 6-1:

89
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

For a click-through ad, keep in mind the following tips:
 Remember to say “click here” in your banner. You would be surprised
at the number of banners that fail to tell a viewer what action to take.
 Make it short. Don’t bore customers with all the grimy details. Viewers
don’t have time to wade through your long copy in the myriad ads that
bombard them. Get to the point — and fast!
Figure 6-2:

Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

 Use the word free in your ad. Free can always catch someone’s eye —
no matter how focused he is on some other task. Just remember to
follow through on your promise of something free. Customers won’t
come back if you trick them.
 Pose a question. Questions encourage people to click, but you want it to
be a compelling question, such as “What three things do all best-selling
novels have in common?”
 Be sure that people feel as if they can get something they want by
clicking on your ad. “Click here to get a free personalized estimate of
your social security benefits with private accounts” is much better than
“Click here for information about social security.” People don’t want to
merely visit another Web site; they want to feel that a click can bring
them value. Give it to them.
 Make your banner interactive. We all like to be involved, and your 
viewers are no different.
 Change your banners frequently. If a user hasn’t clicked after three
visits, he isn’t likely to do so in the future.
 Create a mystery. Curiosity is an extraordinary motivator. Suppose
you’re in the computer peripheral business, and you sell keyboards. 
Of course, we all know that the top row of a keyboard contains these 
letters: QWERTYUIOP. Now to create a mystery in your ad, ask people 
to guess the longest word that can be typed using only those letters. I
know a lot of people who wouldn’t be able to resist clicking over to your
site to find the answer, but I’m sure you would never fall for such a silly
trick, now would you? (By the way, the answer isn’t typewriter. Oh no,
that would be too easy. It’s Rupturewort, a West Indian plant.) People
love to discover intriguing facts — and they’ll click over to your site to
do just that.
If your banner ad is part of a sell-through campaign, you need a fast-loading
banner. The point of a sell-through campaign is an immediate sale. How can a
slow-loading graphic accomplish that goal? It can’t. Create a sense of urgency.
The words “Last day of sale” help. For a sell-through campaign, do all the
things you would do for a click-through campaign, except don’t create a 
mystery. You want good strong information so someone will buy as soon as
he reaches your site.
Finding a banner designer
Before you start looking for someone to design your banner ad, be sure to
find a few samples of banners that you like. Let a designer know what you
want to do. In the same regard, know whether you want a branding campaign,
a click-through campaign, or a sell-through campaign. To find a designer, 
ask your ISP for references; check out the list of banner designers at www.
bannertips.com/designersForHire.shtml or search online by entering
“professional banner design” into a search engine.

Doing e-mail advertising
E-mail is the sweetheart of the current advertising models. It’s cheap. It’s fast.
It’s effective. Recently, response rates for permission-based advertising (where
you ask the customer before sending e-mail) beat the heck out of banner ad
click-through rates.
Why is e-mail so successful? Because it’s a form of dialogue. Your customers
can respond to you, a real human being, instead of watching a Web page.
Think of an e-mail campaign as being an extension of your other advertising
strategies. You don’t want to replace them entirely, but you can add the hottest
sizzle in town by using e-mail. The reason e-mail is hot is that you can target so
effectively. You can be wildly creative — embedding audio and video and inter-
active capabilities in your messages — for relatively little expense.
In the next sections, I offer pointers on the best way to do e-mail advertising.
I tell you how to compile — and/or buy — good lists of people to send your
e-mail ads to. I also advise writing and sending your own newsletter via e-mail
to prospective customers.
Collecting lists
If you want to use e-mail in your ad campaign, you’re going to need e-mail
addresses of people to send your messages to. Start by asking your regular
customers for their e-mail addresses. Those who want to receive ads from
you will comply — and you don’t want to bother the people who don’t want
to give you their e-mail addresses.

Are banners and buttons effective?
If you get a 1 or 2 percent conversion rate, your
banners are performing at or above normal.
That’s dismal, you say. Well, yes it is, but consider
the whole story before rushing to judgment.
When so many dot-coms failed that we started
to call them dot-bombs, online ad impressions
still increased exponentially and reached an all-
time high in December 2000 — the height of the
panic.
Plus, with so many more ads out there now, the
conversion rate is bound to be lower. Not all
companies spend the time or effort to care
about the right kind of banner put in the right
place to do the right job. So good banners and
buttons can be very effective.
Banner bashing is popular. Maybe it’s right, too.
I can’t guarantee you that banner advertising
will wind up being the online ad model that
works. But I do think incorporating banners into
your overall advertising strategy makes sense.

You can also collect information from those who visit your site by asking
them for their feedback. Inquire about their interests. Ask them for their
e-mail addresses. Offer discount store coupons or tickets to a local show 
to people who give you information. Remember: The data people give you 
is valuable, so you may want to give a little something in return for the 
information they give.
You can also buy lists containing thousands of e-mail addresses. But I hate
this method because the people on those lists haven’t asked to be there. 
If you send unsolicited advertisements, you’re sending spam (unwanted
e-mail). Spam is unkind, unfair, and counterproductive. Plus, response rates
on these kinds of e-mails are low.
Publishing newsletters
E-mail newsletters are an increasingly popular Web phenomenon. Offer a
newsletter on your Web site and allow people to sign up. Then, once a week
or once a month, send out information about your business — information
that can help the customer. Be generous with your tips and information perti-
nent to your business. Word will get out that you offer good value, and people
will come.
A holistic veterinarian I know started her newsletter over a year ago, and it’s
a winner. Each month she sends out a newsletter via e-mail that is chock full
of tips for animal health. And her business has increased dramatically.
Using e-mail successfully
E-mail can be a strong part of your overall advertising campaign. In order to
make this happen, be sure to follow these tips:
 Ask for e-mail addresses — never send unsolicited e-mail. People don’t
like to have e-mail forced into their mailbox, piling up without an end in
sight. Make sure the e-mail addresses you obtain are given voluntarily
from customers who really want to hear from you.
 Keep records of all registrations forever. Sometimes, years later,
people tell you they never signed up. With great courtesy, show them
their original registration and the date you received it.
 Always offer a chance to opt out. In each e-mail, tell people how they
can stop receiving the mail (unsubscribe). Make the instructions clear
and prominent.
 State your privacy policy. Tell people that you will never share or sell
their e-mail addresses. And keep your word.
93
Chapter 6: Online Advertising

 Appoint a real, live person to handle problems and inquiries. Your
goal should be to respond to each e-mail within 12 hours. Sooner is
better. Another good idea is to have an automated reply that is sent
immediately and lets the person know you received his message. Be
sure to follow up with a personalized reply as soon as possible. Many 
(if not most) ISPs offer the ability to respond automatically.
 Keep your list secure. Make sure that the recipients can’t see each
other’s e-mail addresses. You can figure out how to make an alias list 
and put that list in the blind carbon copy (BCC) area when sent.
 Check the e-mail you send out for typos, misspellings, and so on. Put
your best foot forward.
 Choose your subject line with care. Make it provocative — and make it
sound like something other than an ad. “Make money fast,” doesn’t work.
“A unique opportunity to improve your business,” does work.
 Avoid closing down communication. I once had an e-mail correspon-
dence that left me infuriated. I was about to buy a new car, and I wanted
my new baby to be perfect. I requested (by e-mail) a certain color that I
had seen on another model by the same auto manufacturer. I received an
e-mail in response that stated I couldn’t have my car in that color. Well,
okay, but the infuriating part was that her note had a postscript that
read, “Have a nice day!” With that one line, the salesperson declared the
conversation over and closed down communication. Never close off
communication with a customer.

B
ecause television is more fragmented by the numerous cable channels
now available, radio formats and magazines are more tightly targeted to
very narrow audiences, the Internet is a more popular alternative to tradi-
tional media, and consumers have increasingly more media choices, advertis-
ers have a difficult time reaching their entire target audience with a single
medium. For this reason, you also need to consider advertising in newspa-
pers, locally published magazines, and the magazine sections of your local
newspaper. Print is a tried-and-true vehicle for advertising, and if you use it
well, print ads can work for you, too.
Your print-buying options are many and varied, but in this chapter, I focus
primarily on newspaper advertising. The good news is that the formula for
designing and writing an effective print ad remains the same across the
board, so whether you decide to use your print ad in a medium other than
newspaper, you can use this information just as well.
Exploring the Advantages of Print
Despite the fact that newspaper readership has been declining steadily for
years, papers still have a lot going for them. They cover the entire demo-
graphic spectrum, and their flexibility allows you to stretch your advertising
budget. You don’t need to buy a full-page ad — newspapers can sell you ads
in an infinite variety of sizes. By designing small-space ads, you can buy more
frequency and more audience, and, in many cases, you can get great position
on the page.

As a general rule, the smaller the ad, the lower the cost per view. However,
the ad size you choose should match the “size” of the news announcement in
your ad. For example, if you’re advertising a giant once-a-year sale, a larger
ad better communicates that message. In contrast, a weekly special at a small
restaurant is better suited to a small space ad. Larger ads are more often
seen than smaller ads, but ad space is sold by the column inch, and the rela-
tionship between size and true impressions isn’t linear.
Also, you don’t need to run four-color ads (even the large, national advertis-
ers and their ad agencies rarely spend their money for that luxury), because
newspapers are, essentially, still a black-and-white medium. Even though USA
Today forever changed the face of newspapers by being the first to publish a
color paper back in 1982, costly four-color ads are still very rare in most
dailies (although four-color process is used in editorial content and news
photos all the time).
Another advantage to advertising in newspapers is the fact that they are
printed in sections, each one targeted to a particular interest — from sports
to entertainment to business. Buying space in the section that has been for-
matted to reach the greatest number of persons in your primary target audi-
ence demographic gives your ads a better chance of being read by your
prospective customers, which, in turn, helps you spend your budget more
effectively. Newspapers are the pickup trucks of advertising — solid, sturdy,
no-nonsense, and unglamorous — but they get the job done.
Print advertising isn’t limited to newspapers, though. Your local newspaper
may also include a locally focused magazine section. If you live in a large met-
ropolitan area, several locally published special-interest magazines will be
happy to sell you ads. You can also buy ad space in regional editions of major
magazines, such as Sports Illustrated, U.S. News and World Report, and Time,
which, although still a bit pricey, are often affordable (and always presti-
gious) to the local advertiser. Finally, the community papers, college papers,
entertainment guides, classified advertising papers, auto-seller papers, and
countless other advertising media are options you may want to consider
(although some of these publications make better fish wrap than advertising
vehicles, so be careful).
Recognizing What Makes 
a Print Ad Successful
Advertising legend David Ogilvy was famous for writing print ads that con-
tained literally thousands of words. He assumed a certain intelligence and
curiosity in his readers, and he gave them an incredible volume of facts about
the various products he was selling. But that was in a different, less hectic
time. Ogilvy’s approach probably won’t work in this day and age, when the
average American is exposed to about 250 ad messages every day (which
96
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

includes TV, radio, and print). In my opinion, today, brevity is the soul of
print.
Having said that, there is still a place for long-copy ads, depending on the
market you’re trying to reach and the type of ad you’re running. For example,
most advertising to older consumers requires more copy (but legible copy!),
because seniors tend to be willing to read and want complete information
before letting go of their hard-earned cash. Another reason to use long copy
is when you’re doing direct selling or seeking an order directly as a result of
an ad, which requires a more-complete sales message and is therefore best
suited to a long-copy approach.
In addition to copious amounts of white space (white background without any
graphics or type, like the margins on this page), an effective print ad must
include three main elements:
 A strong headline
 Brief sell copy
 An arresting graphic
Anything else, other than your logo, is clutter, and the average person just
doesn’t have the time to sift through the mess. (For more on these three 
elements, check out the section “Writing and Designing an Eye-Catching 
Print Ad.”)
Some advertisers design reverse ads (a black background with white letters)
in their effort to attract the readers’ attention. But I don’t think this tech-
nique works any better than a nicely designed, clean ad with lots of white
background.
Most print ads are so muddled with copy, headlines, subheads, banners,
graphics, prices, and logos that the reader’s eye moves right past the ads,
because deciphering what the heck the ad is trying to sell is nearly impossi-
ble. The ads are such a blur that they appear to be in motion! It’s as if the
advertisers, who spend a lot of money for the ads, want to squeeze as much
information as possible into the space to get their money’s worth. Unfortu-
nately, a page filled with confusing, poorly designed ads is a page to quickly
turn, and that’s exactly what the readers do.
The ads that grab your audience’s attention, the ones that make an impact
and have a chance of being read, are the ones that are attractively designed
and invite your audience to stop for a moment. Good ads are uncluttered and
have clever headlines and interesting graphic elements — they’re reader-
friendly.
On the other hand, some cluttered ads can still be attractively designed to
make them easy to read and simple to grasp. If your business has multiple
locations, extensive inventory, or numerous products, you may need to
97
Chapter 7: Using Print Ads: Small Spaces with Big Audiences

include a lot of information in your ad. For example, my wireless client uses
newspaper to advertise certain cellular offers. These offers can be very com-
plicated, requiring extensive explanation and disclaimers. He also has dozens
of store locations that must be included in his print ads. But his ads (which
are designed by Pulse Media, a very talented local graphic design firm) never
appear cluttered, even though they are rarely larger than 4 columns wide by
12 inches high. Even with all the elements he has to include, his ads still have
ample room for white space. This achievement is a testament to thoughtful,
clean design — something you, too, should strive for.
Figure 7-1 gives you a look at a cluttered print ad that worked. (It’s from my
For Dummies friends, so you know it worked!) This ad could be surrounded
by other ads and still jump off the page. A lot of information is packed into
this ad, so it could easily have been a hodgepodge of clutter. But instead, the
ad is clean and easy to understand, even though it contains the following 
elements:
 8 photos — and a cartoon!
 A headline, promising a rebate
 The fill-in-the-blank coupon
 Instructions on how to fill out the coupon

Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

So what keeps this ad from appearing cluttered? The ad uses bold graphic
elements and typography. The first things the eye sees are probably the pic-
tures of the books, then the headline (“Buy any Dummies book and get $5.00
with a mail-in rebate”). Those elements are the foundation of the ad and the
primary hooks to attract new customers: Who doesn’t want to save money?
If you must include multiple products and/or numerous complicated ele-
ments in your print ads, you can still create a crisp, uncluttered look by
paying careful attention to the design and layout. (For more on this, see the
sections “Generating your graphics” and “Don’t forget the layout!”.)
Writing and Designing an 
Eye-Catching Print Ad
Newspaper and magazine readers (your prospective customers) don’t care
nearly as much about your business as you do. As a matter of fact, they don’t
care about your business at all. So for this reason, your ads must be clear,
succinct, informative, and inviting. Your ads need to give readers a reason to
be interested in your business. They can’t be pompous and assume, through
complicated copy or confusing graphics, that the readers understand every-
thing there is to know about your business and the products or services
you’re selling. In fact, your print ad has just a split second to attract attention
and quickly explain why your product or service has some lasting benefit to
those who read about it.
When you sit down to write a print ad, keep in mind that those who read it
aren’t going to spend a lot of time doing so. Plus, your ad, especially a news-
paper ad, will very likely share a page with many other ads, each of which is
vying for the reader’s attention. And you will probably have no control over
the page on which your ad is inserted or the position of your ad on that page.
Therefore, brief copy and a clean design are the soul of print, and to achieve
the best possible retail ad, you must give careful attention to the three basic
elements (from the previous section) of a good print ad. In the following sec-
tions, I cover each of these elements — plus some — so you can use them
effectively.
Hammering out your headline
In nearly all cases, the headline is the single most-important element of a
print ad. The headline has no more than a split second to grab the reader’s
attention. It’s often the largest element on an ad, is generally placed at the
top of the ad, and is the first thing — sometimes the only thing — a reader
99
Chapter 7: Using Print Ads: Small Spaces with Big Audiences

sees. Research says that 90 percent of body copy goes unread, so your head-
line had better be good. If the headline is clever, informative, and inviting, it
can stop the reader dead in his tracks. If the headline is long, drawn out, and
boring (or if it doesn’t even exist), the reader will skip right past your ad
without giving a moment’s thought to all the money you spent putting it
there.
Strive to be clear and concise in your headlines. Avoid the temptation to
become so “creative” that your meaning is lost or obscured.
Think of your ad headline the way you do the title of a book — for example, this
book, Advertising For Dummies, 2nd Edition, pretty much sums up what this
book is about and what level of experience you need to have to benefit from
the information in it. That’s how succinct your ad headline should be. In con-
trast, we could have titled this book something like An Easy-to-Read and Helpful
How-to-do-it Guide to Advertising Your Business (Whatever it May Be, Whether
You’re Selling Products or Services) for People Who Don’t Have Any Background
in Advertising. But that title takes too long to read and figure out — even
though it offers more information than our pithy title. Keep that in mind when
you’re writing your headline: Keep it short and to the point. (See the sidebar
“It’s an ad, not an encyclopedia,” in this chapter for more on headline length.)
The headline is worth some extra work on your part because it may be the
only element of your ad that anyone reads. When I write a print ad, I probably
spend 90 percent of my time devising the headline. When the light bulb
finally goes on and I’m satisfied that the headline is as good as it can be, the
body copy falls quickly into place. And if the headline is well written and
descriptive enough, it can either stand alone or pull the reader’s eye to the
body copy (the copy that sells the product, as described in this chapter’s sec-
tion “Building your body copy”).
Your headline usually works together with your graphic element, and vice
versa — the headline and graphics usually go hand-in-hand. The head (that’s
ad speak for headline) and the graphic, whether it’s a photo or a drawing, set
the tone of the ad and should be able to stand alone, whether or not anyone
gets around to reading the body copy. The head and graphic must create the
uniqueness of your ad, the extra something that separates you from all your
rivals who are advertising in the same print media.
Often, an ad consists of nothing more than a headline, a subhead, and a logo.
An ad for a clothing store may have a headline that reads, “ONE DAY ONLY
SALE!” and a subhead that reads, “Hurry! All suits, sports jackets, and slacks
reduced 50 percent this Saturday only.” Add the store logo, the address, and
a phone number, and the ad is complete — it contains all the information the
reader needs.
100
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Where the headline is placed within the ad is as important as what the head-
line says. You need to make sure that the headline dominates the ad so it can
be quickly understood. Too often, the headline, which includes the most
important information within an ad, is lost in a muddle of too many type
fonts, graphics, and other elements. The reader’s eye isn’t drawn to anything,
the ad is ignored, and the advertiser’s money goes down the drain.
Shaping your subheads
In addition to the main headline, a subhead is used to impart secondary infor-
mation. The headline must grab readers, but the subhead can explain the
deal further. Keep your headline brief and clever, and use the subhead to be a
bit more expansive with your information. For example, if you’re selling a
product, the headline may read, “The Deal of the Century!” The subhead
could follow with, “We’re having a store-wide clearance sale.” If you’re selling
a service, the headline could be, “Don’t Pay Your Taxes!” The subhead could
read, “Until you talk with Smith Accountancy.”
Not all ads require a subhead, but this element, generally set in smaller type, is
there to give the reader additional information without cluttering up your ad.
Building your body copy
The body copy, also known as the sell copy, is where you can explain your
offer in detail. But, like everything else in a good print ad, you need to keep
the body copy brief — and possibly not include it at all. A good ad can get by
without body copy, using just a well-written headline and a solid subhead.
Don’t expect rapt attention and deep involvement from the reader. (Ninety
percent of the time, body copy goes unread.) The reader doesn’t have time to
sift through mounds of information in order to find a reason to respond.
Squeezing 50 pounds of copy into a one-pound ad is a mistake. When writing
body copy for a print ad, regardless of the size of the ad, invoking the KISS
Rule — keep it simple, stupid — is a good idea.
Link the headline, key visual, and opening line of your body copy. Readers are
much more likely to make sense of your ad if the headline and key visual work
extremely well together. It also helps bring the reader into your ad if the copy
lead is consistent with the premise of your headline and key visual.
101
Chapter 7: Using Print Ads: Small Spaces with Big Audiences

Generating your graphics
Whether it’s photography, fine art, line art, cartoon, or typography, the
graphic element of your ad is there to attract the readers’ eyes and interest
them enough to read your body copy. Your graphic, together with your head-
line, is there to encourage readers to invest a little time to actually absorb
what it is you’re trying to sell. The graphic element usually calls attention to,
or complements, the headline — the two elements work together to create
the overall ambience of the ad.
Make sure your graphic element is relevant to what you’re selling. A photo of
a girl in a bikini isn’t the best way to sell anything except bikinis. Health and
fitness spas are always using bathing suit babes as their central graphic. (Are
some people really dumb enough to believe that those women are actually
members?)
If your ad is for a straightforward, no-holds-barred clearance sale, your
graphic element may be nothing more than a very large headline spelled out
in a bold, readable typeface that says, “Get In Here!” If, on the other hand,
your ad is meant to announce a new product, then a quality photo or drawing
of that product, along with a subtle headline, will do nicely.
102
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
It’s an ad, not an encyclopedia
The primary mistake made in many print ads is
verbosity. The philosophy seems to be: Why use
5 words when 500 words will do? Readers aren’t
interested in how to make a fine Swiss watch.
They’re only interested in how much money
they can save if they buy the watch from you.
A brief headline is particularly important. A
headline reading, “50 PERCENT SAVINGS” is
better than one reading, “Everything storewide
has been marked down 50 percent.” Making
your headline brief, intriguing, and easy to
grasp, most certainly, enhances your ad’s effec-
tiveness. Trying to fit too much information into
the headline can be self-defeating. Use the sub-
head or the body copy for the nuts and bolts of
your sales pitch.
Keep your body copy brief and your graphic ele-
ments relevant and bold. That way, you make it
easy for your readers to grasp what you’re
trying to say and what you’re striving to sell.
Just because you’ve spent a fair amount of
money to buy the ad space doesn’t mean that
you have to fill it wall-to-wall. An ad that’s easy
for the reader to understand may be rewarded
with the reader dropping into your store or con-
tacting you, credit card poised and at the ready!
Do what I do: Write your ad, and then go back
and see how many superfluous words you can
eliminate until your copy is as tight as it can pos-
sibly be. In print copy, less is more!

Newspapers can sometimes mangle a good photograph in the printing
process — and unless you’re paying big bucks, the graphics will probably be
black and white. When a photo is reproduced in a newspaper, it always runs
the risk of appearing too dark, too light, or too cloudy (especially if one of the
pressmen has neglected to re-ink the rollers). Newspapers do strive for good
quality in their printing process, but to avoid frustration and irate clients, I
usually avoid using photos in newspaper ads. A black-and-white line drawing
usually reproduces much better.
Lines, shapes, borders, symbols, and clip art are available to you on your
computer right alongside a few dozen different type fonts. You shouldn’t have
any trouble creating a good print ad complete with a clever headline and an
arresting graphic by using nothing more than your word-processing program.
Of course, if you aren’t all that comfortable with a computer, you may want to
employ the services of a good graphic designer. Hiring a professional to do a
professional’s job, regardless of what the job is, always pays in the long run.
But whether you’re able to hire a pro depends on your budget.
The newspaper in which you’re advertising can also provide you with design
help. If you feel comfortable with their abilities, you may want to just let the
newspaper’s design department handle the whole enterprise of producing
your ad. This service is called pub set (which means the publication sets the
ad), and it’s usually free. Keep in mind that, as with anything in life, you get
what you pay for.
Don’t forget the layout!
The design and layout of an ad is everything. Print ads are often very poorly
designed. These ads are easily ignored because they don’t attract the eye to any
particular feature or element, and they certainly don’t sell anybody anything.
Figure 7-2 illustrates a sample layout for a magazine ad. If you stick to this
kind of layout, you can’t go wrong.
103
Chapter 7: Using Print Ads: Small Spaces with Big Audiences
Getting the help you need
The artists who work in the retail design and
layout department of your local paper are prob-
ably overworked, underpaid, and not always
diligent in their efforts. But they are capable of
doing good work if you insist on it (if they didn’t
have talent they wouldn’t have been hired by
the publication in the first place). Ask for their
help, and don’t accept an ad that you feel could
have been done much better.
Remember: Don’t be adversarial in your deal-
ings with the newspaper staff, but do let them
know that you have definite ideas on what a
good ad layout is. These artists, like anyone
else, would rather do work they can be proud of.

You can do good print advertisement designs by using various computer art
programs. But if you’re not sure whether you’re the best person to handle the
layout of your ad, hire a professional to do it for you. The extra money spent
will come back to you in the form of increased attention to your ad and cus-
tomer response. If you’re using the publication’s designers, stay on top of
Getaclue.

Chapter 7: Using Print Ads: Small Spaces with Big Audiences
Image is everything
A clean, well-designed, and orderly print ad can
go a long way in telling readers that your busi-
ness is also clean, well designed, and orderly.
By making your point in clear, concise terms,
you’re doing the readers a favor. They can see
at a glance whether you’re selling something
they need. You haven’t taken much of their time,
and they appreciate that.
Whether you’re buying a full-page or a one-
column two-inch ad, your ad must focus the
reader’s eyes on the most relevant information
as quickly as possible. Every other ad in the
publication is competing for the reader’s atten-
tion. Your ad may even be stacked atop the ad of
your direct competitor (if it is, get the newspa-
per to give you a make good, in which you get
another ad free of charge). Give yourself a
chance by designing and writing a superior ad
that cuts through all the clutter and gives the
reader a reason to stop for a moment.

itting before a blank piece of paper or an empty computer screen and
attempting to write a 60-second radio commercial that can effectively
and memorably motivate listeners to buy your product or service can be an
intimidating task. How do you separate yourself from the herd? What magic
words can you use to describe all the wonderful reasons why consumers
should hire you or buy from you instead of from the dozens of other busi-
nesses out there trying to convince them of the same thing? How can you
turn hard facts into clever copy that cuts through the clutter and stops listen-
ers dead in their tracks?
Writing radio ads is a process, like anything else, and it gets easier the more
you do it. In this chapter, I lead you through the process one step at a time
and, with any luck whatsoever, by the end of this chapter, you’ll be writing
spots like a pro. To pack a thousand seconds of information into a 60-second
bag isn’t as hard as it appears if you follow these guidelines.
Summarizing Your Business 
in 60 Seconds
You may think it’s a daunting prospect to tell your customers everything they
need to know about your business within the limited time frame of one
minute. But a minute is quite a long time, actually. Look at your watch and let
a full minute go by. Tapping your fingers or fidgeting in your seat isn’t

allowed. Concentrate on the second hand (or the seconds ticking off on your
digital watch). See what I mean? A minute is a long time. Sixty excruciatingly
slow clicks. Just think of all the wonderful information you can squeeze into a
spot within that huge amount of time.
The trick here is to concentrate on the relevant information you want to
impart and to discard everything else. You simply can’t summarize an ency-
clopedia’s worth of information in 60 seconds, but you can tell the world
quite a lot about yourself in that length of time. Writing radio 60s, as they’re
called, is good practice for you because, if you’re ever interested in writing
ads for television, you need to do this in 30 seconds — or even 15. Whew!
So what information do you need to convey in your ad? Okay, here it comes,
folks, a professional copywriter’s secret, a revelation so incredible, so astute,
so amazing that you’ll likely say to yourself, “Humph! I knew that!” It’s the
same basic informational formula used by journalists — namely: Who, what,
when, where, and why (otherwise known as the five Ws).
When arranged in a radio spot, the five Ws don’t always fall in a particular
order, of course. Including them all is a good idea, but you can arrange them
any way you like — within reason.
In this section, I uncover how the five Ws apply to you and how you can use
them to create memorable radio ads.
Who are you?
The first thing you want your listener to know is who you are, so you need to
mention the name of your business within the first line or two. I hear com-
mercials all the time that drone on and on and never seem to think that the
sponsor’s name is important enough to mention until somewhere around the
last five seconds. This format is a big, fat, money-wasting mistake because by
then it’s too late. Listeners never hear every word of your commercial. It
doesn’t matter whether they hear it 20 times, or even 100 times, they don’t
listen carefully to each and every word. Instead, they hear bits and pieces of
it. They may recall some elements of it. They know they’ve heard “some-
thing” that appeals to them. They may even respond to it (at least you hope
they do). But listeners are never able to recite your ad word for word. So
telling them who you are immediately is very important.
What are you selling?
The next thing you want listeners to know is what you’re selling. Which of
your products or services are you featuring in this spot? Don’t try to sell your
entire business in one 60-second spot. It just doesn’t work — you can confuse
listeners even more than they already are.
108
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Instead, target your message to one or two important elements. Give the lis-
tener a fighting chance to remember what the heck you’re talking about.
If you have too much information to squeeze into one spot, write two differ-
ent spots and rotate them 50/50 on the air.
Consumers are being deluged with advertising information, both audio and
visual, each and every waking moment of their lives. The first thing they see
in the morning is advertising on the toothpaste tube, then on the cereal box
and milk carton, then on the coffee can, then on the labels of their clothes,
and only then, after subliminally absorbing dozens of advertising messages,
do they pick up their newspapers, or turn on the radio or TV, all of which
bury consumers in advertising.
All you’re trying to do in your spot — all you can hope to do — is get your
foot in the door with one juicy tidbit of information, so your audience recalls
at least something of what you’re saying. Target your message very carefully
and succinctly. Narrow your message to simple, hard-hitting, important facts
that listeners can remember and act on.
When do you want consumers to act?
You can’t expect your listeners to act if they don’t know when to do it. When
does your special sale price take effect? When does this offer go away? When
is your store open? This W is a great area into which you can insert your calls
to action, such as the following:
 “This offer absolutely ends midnight Saturday.”
 “Hurry in today!”
 “Call now!”
 “We’re staying open until 10:00 every night to keep up with customer
demand.”
 “Sale ends Thursday.”
If you can insert an element of urgency into your commercial, you give listen-
ers just that much more to think about and a good reason to act.
How can customers get in touch with you?
You definitely want to tell your listeners where you are and how they can find
you. Although this sounds rather basic, you may be amazed at how many
spots wait until the end of the ad to mention it — or even forget this all-
important information altogether!
109
Chapter 8: Radio: Effective, Affordable, and Fun

You want to include your phone number (preferably, a toll-free number, so
customers won’t have to pay for the call!) so customers can call for informa-
tion or for directions to your nearest store.
For your business location, give the address and phone number, but be care-
ful here: Listeners can’t be expected to remember too many numbers or com-
plicated directions. Chances are they hear your spot while driving or doing
something else, and they aren’t inclined or able to jot down any information.
When was the last time you were so blown away by an advertising message
that you pulled your car off the road and wrote down the advertiser’s name
and address? Probably never.
The simpler, the better. Include a phone number rather than an address. Be
sure to repeat the phone number a minimum of two times. If you absolutely
must include an address, write something like, “Located on Main Street near
First,” instead of expecting anyone to recall “36452 East Main Street.”
If you have a Web address, use it in your spot instead of the phone number.
Don’t mention them both — remembering that many numbers and letters is
just too much to ask of your listeners.
Why should customers 
hire or buy from you?
And now the most important of all the elements of a commercial, the why.
Ask yourself the following questions before drafting your copy:
 Why should the customer buy from you rather than from somebody
else?
 Why should the customer hire you or your company instead of someone
else?
 Why is your deal the very best deal that customers are ever going to
find?
 Why should anyone go out of his way to seek out your product or ser-
vice when buying it somewhere else may be much more convenient?
Sell your expertise; a great price and terms; a friendly, family-like atmos-
phere; a closeout price that’s irresistible; or any number of other points. The
why part of your ad is very likely the reason you’re advertising in the first
place. It’s your hook, your reason for being, your unique product difference.
This area separates the successful businesses from the also-rans.

Putting the five Ws to use
If your head is spinning from the thought of
incorporating the five Ws into one radio spot,
here’s an example of how you can even incor-
porate them into one sentence that opens a 
60-second radio commercial:
CALIFORNIA DINETTES (Who), PURVEY-
ORS OF FINE CASUAL DINING FURNITURE
(What), IS HAVING ITS ANNUAL SPRING
DECORATING SALE (Why) BEGINNING
FRIDAY (When) AT ITS BEAUTIFUL SHOW-
ROOMS IN SAN JOSE, SAN CARLOS, AND
PLEASANT HILL (Where).
This sentence would be a good opener to a 60-
second spot because it tells listeners nearly
everything they need to know right off the bat.
It also leaves 50 seconds in which to get more
specific (for example, to add a broad descrip-
tion of the furniture items on sale, what the
prices and terms are, the telephone number, the
sale deadline, and so on). But if listeners only
hear the first few words of this spot, the first
sentence gives them all the truly important
information about this furniture sale.
This spot is also a completed 10-second spot,
which stations sometimes call billboards, I.D.s,
or promos. If your media buy includes 10-
second spots (which are often included at no
charge), then this spot is what you want to air.
Listeners may not even hear your 60-second
spot, but they may hear one of your billboards.
Try to include everything they need to know
within those first ten seconds.
You can expand this spot into the complete 60-
second version as well. Add more specific infor-
mation and dress it up with adjectives and a call
to action. See if you can identify the five Ws in
this spot. They’re all there — and more than
once.

Notice that the complete 60-second spot men-
tions the name of the store three times and its
locations twice. It describes what furniture is on
sale, lists the many whys, and inserts two calls
to action (“Come and get ’em” and “Hurry in
today for best selection!”). If listeners hear only
the first sentence or the final sentence, those
listeners have heard enough to know that some-
thing interesting is going on at California
Dinettes.

You must always find the magic why in order to have any hope of listener
response to your commercials. For example, your listener can buy a can of
paint anywhere, from any hardware store. But your business, your products,
your prices, your terms, your convenient location, your incredible customer
service, your friendly employees, your free gourmet coffee and your plush,
posh, golly-gosh waiting room are so much better than anyone else’s that
he’d be a fool not to rush right in and give you his business. That’s the why.
And, to the ultimate success of your spot, the why is everything.
Deciding on the Format for Your Ad
Radio ads are there to get the attention of your listeners — people you want
to become customers if they aren’t already. Before you sit down and start
writing, consider: If you want your radio ad to be effective, it needs to do the
following, all within the span of one minute (or between 180 and 200 words):
 Grab the listeners’ attention
 Tell them something they want to hear
 Sell them something they may not need
 Mention the name of your business several times
 Get your phone number or Web address indelibly written into their
brains
 Motivate them with a call to action (something that tells your reader
what to do, such as “Call today for the best prices!” or “In stores now!”)
Knowing what to include in your ad is one thing, but an equally important
part of creating your ad is knowing how exactly to communicate that mes-
sage. In the following sections, I cover some common formats for radio spots.
Within these different formats, of course, you may discover endless room for
creativity. So flex those creative muscles!
Due to the ever-changing world of technology, each station has its own
requirements for your advertising materials. You can’t find one exact form to
use when submitting broadcast copy, so be sure to check with the station to
make sure your materials are up to par.
Talking it up: Dialogue
Dialogue is a common form of radio spots, but like fingernails on a black-
board, it makes me cringe. The problem with dialogue radio spots is that
they’re usually poorly written. Can you think of any radio commercials more
ridiculous than a poorly written, poorly acted dialogue spot?
112
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

You know the ones I mean — they’re the spots in which two people are doing
or talking about something totally unrelated to the product being sold, and
then they awkwardly bring the product sell (or message) into the dialogue.
For instance, the spot opens with the sound of a golf ball being hit, and the
following dialogue takes place:
Jim: “Wow, great drive, Bill. I’ve never seen you hit the ball that far
before.”
Bill: “Thanks, Jim. I’m seeing the ball a lot better since I went to Dr.
Fishburn’s Laser Eye Center, where I had both eyes done for just $2,495.”
Jim: “Gee, Bill, do you mean that if I undergo major eye surgery at Dr.
Fishburn’s Laser Eye Center, and spend only $2,495, I can hit the ball 
farther, too?”
Bill: “No doubt about it, Jim. You’ll improve your game and improve your
life at Dr. Fishburn’s Laser Eye Center. Just call 1-800-555-1212 and make
an appointment.”
Jim: “What was that number again, Bill? Did you say 1-800-555-1212?”
Bill: “Yep, 1-800-555-1212. Call them today.”
The reason I hate these kinds of radio spots is that nobody talks like that in
real life! These spots just cry out to be ignored, if not laughed at, because
they’re completely unbelievable. Even the major advertising agencies do this
stuff, especially for pharmaceutical clients — and they should know better.
I stay as far away from dialogue spots as I can, and I think you should, too. In
my opinion, nothing is more effective on radio than a single-voice read of
good, believable copy. Don’t offend or insult your listener with a premise and
copy that is unbelievable, contrived, confusing, and just plain dumb. If you
do, you have no one to blame but yourself when that listener reaches over,
punches the radio button, and makes you instantly disappear.
While consumers are listening to your spot on the station you just spent a
bunch of money to buy, you owe it to yourself and to your listeners to capture
their limited attention spans with some good, clear copy — copy that gives
them a reason to listen and a reason to buy your product. If you confuse the
issue with an unrealistic concept and improbable copy, you lose them.
Amusing (and schmoozing) the masses:
Comedy
Like dialogue spots, a poorly conceived comedy premise and badly written
copy do a lot more harm than good — so tread lightly. Setting up an amusing
idea, including some copy that actually sells your product in an entertaining
113
Chapter 8: Radio: Effective, Affordable, and Fun

manner, and then delivering a good punch line in the span of 60 seconds is
difficult. The sad number of unfunny spots on the air that are trying to be
comical is a testament to the difficulty inherent in comedy writing.
When it comes to good comedy writing, you’ve either got it, or you don’t. I
don’t think that you can be taught to write good comedy. Personally, I’ve had
good success with comedy writing, and I’ve used it in many radio spots. But
very few products and services lend themselves to this genre.
Including some tongue-in-cheek styling to your copy, maybe poking a little
fun at yourself, or at least not taking yourself too seriously is okay. But,
unless you’re very proficient at it, leave the comedy writing to the pros
because comedy is very serious business. That’s one of the reasons you may
want to check out Chapter 16 on “Deciding Whether to Hire an Ad Agency.”
Avoid punch line humor. Radio is a frequency medium, so punch lines get old
very fast — and after they do, nobody will want to listen to your ad. The best
style of humor for radio is situational humor. In this style of humor, the situa-
tion is focus of the comedy: The Seinfeld TV show is a classic example of situ-
ational humor.
Giving just the facts: A straight read
A single voice reading 60 seconds of clear, concise, fact-filled copy that moti-
vates and sells listeners is always a good bet. No frills. No jokes. No unrealis-
tic dialogue. Just the offer — the selling proposition — read by a good,
strong, male or female voice. You may want to toss in some background
music or even some sound effects (see the sidebar “Sound effects and music
tracks” for more information). I prefer this format when writing and produc-
ing direct-response broadcast advertising. To me, a straight read is the most
effective copywriting method you can use to convey a selling message. And
it’s the easiest, which, if you’re new to the game, may be the best reason of all
to employ it.
When writing a straight read, you sit down and write a wonderful 60-second
spot with a clear message and a compelling call to action. Then you hand this
script to the voice talent who records it, the engineer adds some appropriate
music or sound effects, and the station puts it on the air. Voilà! Your ad cam-
paign is out there beating on the ears of your potential customers. It’s not a
cute spot. It’s not even a fancy spot. But it’s on the radio getting your mes-
sage out to listeners who, if you’ve followed the writing instructions I outline
in this chapter, are banging on your door, calling you, or checking out your
Web site any minute now.
114
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Determining Who Should Read the Script
After you have your radio spot written, you need to find someone to read it.
And the possibilities are numerous. You can read the spot yourself, have a
studio announcer (someone who works for the radio station) read it for you,
or hire a professional voiceover talent. I cover each of these options in the
following sections.
Doing it yourself
I’m generally against clients voicing their own spots on radio or getting in
front of the cameras on TV. Everyone wants to be in show business; everyone
wants to hear her friends say, “Hey, I heard you on the radio today!” But, gen-
erally speaking, reading your own radio spots is not a very good idea. When
you read your own spots, it usually comes off as amateur night.
Generally, you’re much better off using a professionally trained voice talent
who can give a spot the believability and sincerity it needs, rather than
standing as an inexperienced rookie in front of a microphone and hoping for
the best. Of course, two of the best-known exceptions to this very flexible
rule were Frank Perdue of Perdue Chickens and Dave Thomas of Wendy’s,
both of whom brought a unique, charming talent to their commercials and
were completely believable.
115
Chapter 8: Radio: Effective, Affordable, and Fun
Sound effects and music tracks
Want to jazz up your spot? This may be a good
time to touch on the wonderful world of effects.
Sound effects (SFX) and music tracks (MX) are
the magic that makes radio “the theater of the
mind.” The sound effects and music tracks of
the old-time radio shows put listeners right in
the middle of the action. And that’s what they
can still do for your listeners today. Do you want
500 wild horses to gallop through your commer-
cial? Go for it. Do you want your announcer to
read your spot while standing on the starting
line of a noisy racetrack? No problem. Do you
want your entire spot to take place in a driving
thunderstorm or in the middle of a battlefield?
Be my guest.
Most radio stations and all production houses
have huge collections of stock sound effects
and music for use in commercial backgrounds.
Pick a sound, almost any sound, and they are
sure to have it — and it can be woven seam-
lessly into your spot. Then choose some appro-
priate music and mix it into the backdrop of 
your spot. With these production tricks, even if
you’re only producing a straight read, you can
enhance your ad with effects and background
music to help it cut through the clutter.

116
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
The exception to the rule
Having issued all my warnings about reading
your own radio spots in the section “Doing 
it yourself,” I want to share with you the story 
of one client I have who is the exception to 
the rule. His name is Matt Fidiam, and he’s the
general manager of Parrot Cellular, a major
Northern California wireless retailer.
My agency had been trying unsuccessfully to
get the Parrot Cellular account for so long that
I finally just admitted to myself that it wasn’t
going to happen and had just about given up.
Happily, my business associate, Marnie
Doherty, did not give up. She simply wouldn’t
take no for an answer and kept after the
account like a pit bull. In a final attempt to
attract the client’s attention and, hopefully, to
secure the business, she and I went to a micro-
brewery and whipped up a batch of our very
own beer. Then we bottled it, complete with
custom-labeling Marnie had designed. Knowing
that Mr. Fidiam has a fondness for the occa-
sional exotic beer and a well-developed sense
of humor, we packaged several bottles into a
lovely wooden gift box with an outside label
reading: “You may be shocked to learn we are
not above using bribery!” We then placed the
gift box of custom brew on the doorstep of
Matt’s corporate offices early one morning
before anyone arrived for work. Hey, we had
nothing to lose.
It worked. He called us that very morning and
said, “If you guys are as good at advertising 
as you are at sales, I’ve got to give you my
account.”
After having a few meetings with Matt (even
before we secured the account), it was imme-
diately apparent to me that he would be his own
best on-air talent. He’s a very animated, articu-
late, enthusiastic guy with a great sense of
humor and a very unique voice. It was obvious
that with properly written copy, he would be the
best person to project the personal enthusiasm
he had about his own products. And, in the
process, we would have a one-of-a-kind voice
on the air in the Bay Area selling Parrot Cellular
stores. That revelation made me sure that we
could do a great job on the account in the first
place and what kept Marnie Doherty tena-
ciously pitching the business long after I had
given up. We knew that, given a chance, our
idea of putting him on the air would work for
him. And we were right.
After finally landing the account, we didn’t have
to talk too hard to get him to agree to do a few
spots as a test. I wrote several spots in the first
person (“Hi, this is Matt Fidiam for Parrot
Cellular . . .”). We then went into a recording
studio, put him in front of a mic, and he was, as
I had hoped, a natural. Oh, he stumbled a bit
here and there, but even the pros do that. And,
because the recording process is digital these
days, we were able to cut and paste the spots
so he didn’t have to go back to the beginning
each time he flubbed a line. He wasn’t a pro (not
yet, anyway), but the final commercials were
great.
Now, hundreds of commercials later, Matt
Fidiam’s voice is one of the most recognizable
on Bay Area radio, which is precisely what I
was after in the first place. He and I once
attended a hockey game together, and while we
were chatting in the concession area, a
stranger walked up to him and asked, “Hey,
aren’t you that guy who sells cell phones on the
radio?”
I’ve written so many commercials for Parrot
Cellular that I’ve begun to think like my client. I
know the words he likes to use and the ones he
stumbles over. I know the phrasing that he
prefers and how to insert just the right amount

Even the most gregarious, enthusiastic, vivacious person can be reduced to a
blubbering bowl of jelly when you put him into a sound-proofed booth and
flip the switch on a mic. The same person who is the life of the party and the
best joke teller in the world, the one who has more personality than five
people, is suddenly reduced to a monotone robot. Nothing is worse than a
spot that sounds like it’s being read.
On the other hand, you may have exactly what it takes to come across as
believable and memorable on the air (see the sidebar “The exception to the
rule” for more information). If you’re a natural voice talent, by all means go
for it. No one can possibly sell your products and services better than you.
But be objective when you critique your final commercial. Don’t just play it
for people who are only going to tell you what you want to hear, such as
friends and family. Instead, play it for vendors and customers and watch
them, especially their eyes, carefully while they listen to your spot. They may
be able to lie to you, flatter you, but their eyes (and their body language)
can’t. Of course, in the final analysis, you must make the final decision.
Listen to your finished spot very objectively and try to hear it through the
ears of John or Jane Doe driving down the road being bombarded by com-
mercial message after commercial message. As you listen, assess your com-
mercial by asking the following questions — and answer honestly:
 Does your copy give the listener a reason to act?
 Does your voice and delivery motivate listeners?
 Is your finished commercial memorable?
 Do you sound excited, sincere, and believable?
 If I heard this spot, would I be motivated to respond to it?
If the answer to any of the above questions is no, you probably need to admit
that you’re not the next Ed McMahon and move on to the following section.
117
Chapter 8: Radio: Effective, Affordable, and Fun
of sarcasm and “edge” that have become his
trademark. And now, when we go into a record-
ing studio, Matt is there for no more than ten
minutes. He reads the spots, usually straight
through on the first take, and then he leaves. He
has become the consummate professional
voice talent.
Matt has been so successful with radio adver-
tising that he has moved nearly 80 percent of his
advertising funds into broadcast and has grown,
since I first started working for him, from 11
local stores to 70 stores throughout Northern
California. Parrot Cellular now accounts for
nearly 25 percent of the total new telephone
activations of Northern California Cingular
Wireless. And, today, Parrot Cellular owns Bay
Area radio.

Using a studio announcer
Another option when you’re looking for the right voice for your radio spot is
to rely on the station-employed studio announcers (disk jockeys or on-air
personalities). The advantage to this route is that it’s the cheapest way to go.
The service is usually free of charge as part of your media buy. You only have
to pay a talent fee if you use a studio announcer who works for a station
other than the one the spots air on. By and large, studio announcers do a
good, if not always enthusiastic, job on most commercial copy they read.
Another advantage is that because these on-air personalities are familiar, lis-
teners are more likely to trust them or at least pay attention to what they
have to say.
Just handing your script to each station you want to advertise on and having
the spots read by various station-employed studio announcers immediately
negates one of the most important elements of a successful broadcast cam-
paign: continuity. Listeners tend to bounce around from station to station
and, if you’re lucky, they may hear your spots on more that one. So you need
to be sure they hear the same message regardless of the station they happen
to be listening to at the time. Plus, if you use a studio announcer, your com-
mercial may wind up sounding just like all the other spots on that station.
After all, your ad isn’t the only one those announcers are reading.
Hiring a professional voice talent
If you’re willing to pay a little more to make your radio spots top notch, you
can hire a pro to read them for you. Your station sales rep, the production
manager at most stations, or even your Yellow Pages (look under “Talent
Agencies”) can steer you toward professional voices in your area. These
people don’t work for any particular station; instead, they’re freelance talents
or voice actors who make their livings doing commercial voiceovers, radio
and TV spots, corporate sales videos, and anything else that requires the 
talents and abilities of someone who is better than most of us are at simply

Depending on the size of the area where you live, you may have a harder time
finding a good voiceover talent, but they’re out there. Your local radio or TV
station’s creative and production personnel can put you in touch with talent
agents or voice talent outside your area, all of whom can do a great job for
you from a distance and send you the finished copy on a CD (or even send
the spots electronically directly to the stations).

For example, my ad agency uses the same six or eight male and female voice
talents for a variety of accounts, because these people have the ability to bring
something fresh and new to everything they do. Even if their spots for different
clients run back-to-back on a station, listeners never know they’re hearing the
same person, because the content of each spot sounds so different.
So if you’re going to do a lot of broadcast advertising, hook up with some pro-
fessional voice talents. Then pay them promptly so they’re always available
when you call.
A pro usually charges a flat fee to voice (record) one 60-second radio spot,
and a different fee to voice a 30-second television spot. You want to hire a
voiceover talent on a buy-out basis, which is simply a fee for service, with no
strings attached. The talent does the spot for a previously agreed-upon price,
you give the actor a check, and she gives you full and unlimited rights to the
finished spot for as long as you want to air it. In other words, you own it and
can do with it as you please.
Be clear about the terms of your agreement with a voice talent from the
beginning so you have no confusion.

Chapter 8: Radio: Effective, Affordable, and Fun
Finding and funding union professionals
Some professional voice talents (usually the
very best of them) are members of the Screen
Actors Guild (SAG) or the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). In other
words, they’re union. Being part of a union
means that they get paid a union minimum fee
to record the spot and grant you the use of it on
the air for 13 weeks — plus they earn residuals
if the spot stays on the air longer than that or
returns on a later flight of commercials (which
are the schedule broadcast dates). And the
really high-powered talent can ask for, and get,
far more than the union minimum. You may not
want this.
Working with union voice talent gets very
expensive, but by employing union talent, you’re
making the trade-off of a higher fee in exchange
for a better finished product. And the whole
point may be moot anyway because you, as a
client, must be what’s called a SAG or AFTRA
signatory in order to employ these union mem-
bers in the first place (although, and I’m not
trying to get anyone into trouble here, I’ve
worked with union talent who waived their
residual rights in exchange for a flat fee just to
get the extra work). If you’ve employed an ad
agency, don’t sweat these details; it can handle
this stuff for you.

If you’re considering hiring professional voice talents, you should shop
around, because costs may vary significantly from one market to the next.
For example, prices in New York City are based on the time the talent spends
recording, charging nonunion talent around $500 for the first hour, and any-
where from $200 to $250 for every extra half hour. However, you can most
likely hire talent for almost $100 less outside of the Big Apple.
Ask your station rep what the going rate is in your area for both nonunion
and union (see the nearby sidebar) talent. Get an upfront quote from the
talent and go from there. Be sure you know what you’re getting into before
committing to a voice talent.
Setting It All in Motion: How to Get 
Your Ad on the Radio
You’ve written your spot. It’s perfect. It’s interesting. It sells. And it even
includes some clever effects. You’ve had it recorded and produced by a top-
quality voice talent (or, in the interest of frugality, you’ve done it yourself),
and you’re ready to put it on the air. You’ve bought advertising schedules on
several radio stations. You’re ready to go. Now what?
First you need a few copies of the master (the original that likely remains in
the custody of the radio station that produced it). I always take a copy for my
agency’s archives and leave the master on file with the station. (Who needs
the extra responsibility of archiving a master copy?)

Help is available
The process of getting your spot on the radio
can seem very technical, complicated, and
even overwhelming. But your radio station’s
sales reps can help lead you through the actual
process one step at a time. Believe me, if the
station rep has gotten a foot in your door and
you’ve placed a buy with him, the radio station
wants everything to go smoothly for you. The
folks there want your spots to be successful so
that you continue to place buys on their station.
So they help in any way they can to ensure that
your advertising works. 
Don’t be afraid to ask questions and to request
your station rep’s expert assistance in giving
your advertising flight (schedule) the best pos-
sible chance to succeed. Remember: Your sta-
tion rep, the person who is actually calling on
your business, is especially interested in your
success. He is paid on commission. He wants
your spots to work, your business to prosper,
and customers to beat down your door, so you
stay with him month after month, year after year.
He helps you get copy written, spots produced,
traffic instructions submitted, dubs sent to other
stations, and whatever else it takes to make you
happy (at least he does if he’s any good).

You need one copy for yourself and one for each radio station on your media
schedule.
Label the copies (or the boxes they come in) with your company name, the
spot title, the spot length, and the production date of the spot. If you want to
get really fancy, order some custom audio labels. But your standard company
mailing labels work just as well.
Don’t send out anything to the stations on your buy that isn’t carefully
labeled. Radio station traffic or continuity departments have enough prob-
lems without trying to find your unlabeled dub (copy of your ad) in a sea of
commercials. The traffic or continuity department schedules and runs the
correct spots at the correct times for each and every advertiser the station
has on the air. That’s hundreds of commercials every day — which can make
for a very hectic and high-stress environment where mistakes can, and do,
happen. So make your instructions to the traffic department very clear to
eliminate confusion.
Here is a sample of good traffic instructions, ready to send with your radio
spot to the radio station’s traffic department:
Your Company Name, address, phone, fax, e-mail, and any other con-
tact information

I call out the flight date. This section alerts the Traffic Department that, at the

instructions will be forthcoming (or your radio schedule concludes).

Chapter 9
Demystifying TV Commercials:
They Don’t Have to Win Awards 
to Be Effective
In This Chapter
 Creating a quality television spot on a budget
 Writing the audio and thinking visually
 Working with a production crew to shoot your spot
 Getting your spot edited to perfection
You’ve probably seen TV commercials from local advertisers and small
businesses that have distinctive advertising that made a name for 
their businesses. Just because you’re not a Fortune 500 company with a 
million-dollar advertising budget doesn’t mean you can’t do effective TV 
commercials.
Many small businesses feature the owner or another family member, or even
an employee, if that person is more comfortable in front of the camera and
would make a good spokesperson for the business. Others use a consistent
theme, piece of music, location, actor, or a premise — this consistency in all
the company’s commercials helps build familiarity with the business. While
you can build a distinctive image in any media, TV is highly successful for
brand building and rewards advertisers that employ continuity.
Continuity is the key when designing an ad campaign. You don’t want to
water down your budget by advertising different messages on various media.
And the foremost element you want to keep in mind as you write your TV
spot are your visuals — think visually and consider your production budget
as you create your spot.

Although you want your TV commercials to be consistent with your radio
spots, TV spots should be more than just radio with visuals. Think about the
TV commercials you not only like but that persuaded you to buy (or at least
investigate) a product being advertised — and keep that in mind when you’re
developing your own TV spots.
The best TV commercials are ones that grab viewers’ attention, making them
want to look at the screen and see how your product can be used, or what
your store looks like and the variety of products you sell, or your earnest
appeal for how your service can help them. TV commercials are even more
effective if they have substantial entertainment value.
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of actually writing your own
TV commercial — from the audio to the visual to the computer graphics. I
also help you find ways to cut costs to stay within your budget. And I let you
know what to expect when your commercial is actually shot and edited.
Producing a TV commercial can be a daunting task, but in this chapter, I
demystify it so that you can put TV to work for you.
Designing Your TV Commercial in Layers
When you set out to create an effective TV commercial, you can easily
become overwhelmed by the various aspects of the job. But keep in mind the
three basic elements to a TV spot: audio, video, and computer graphics. If
you divide your commercial up into these three elements, the job is much
easier to accomplish.
Every television spot doesn’t necessarily include all three elements, but most
good spots do, so consider designing your spot to include all of them. I break
down these three elements in the following sections.
Start with a big idea or campaign theme, and then work on your three layers
from that overall concept. If you don’t have a theme, you’ll just develop a
series of unrelated ads — which won’t help you build name recognition for
your company or attract customers to your business. And that’s your goal,
right?
Audio
Audio is the sound track that augments and enhances the visuals, the sell
copy, the description, and the story that you want to tell. The audio can be a
voiceover (a voice — maybe even yours — doing a sales pitch from off-
camera) or an on-camera actor. The audio track may also include any music
or sound effects you select.
124
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Video
The video is the visual component of the commercial. These pictures are
what the viewers see — they’re what capture the eyes and the attention of
potential customers. The video can be anything from you doing an on-camera
sales pitch, to product footage provided to you by your supplier, to video you
shoot in your store, to anything else you can think of.
Don’t get too carried away with elaborate visual elements that not only add
dramatically to the look of your spot, but also add greatly to the cost of it.
You can create visuals that are effective but cheap — particularly with the
help of computers — it just takes a bit of thought. Instead of you standing on-
camera pitching your business as a herd of wild horses gallops through the
scene, the sound effects of a herd of wild horses galloping by off-camera (and
someone off-camera kicking up copious amounts of dust) can do quite nicely.
Viewers may swear they saw a herd of horses go by as you stand there selling
them your products.
Computer graphics
The final element of a TV commercial is the computer graphics (CG for
short). CG is the lettering (or possibly price numbers) that appears on the
screen to drive home certain points you want to make. It can be made to
flash on and off, wipe or crawl across the screen, spin into the frame, explode
into the frame, or do any number of eye-catching effects.
You can also use computer-generated effects, which can be entire scenes
made to fly into the frame, spin, explode, appear out of infinity, and perform
other interesting tricks. The computers that are available to television edi-
tors do amazing things these days. When you get into the actual production
process, you can enhance your commercial greatly with these wonderful
effects.
While you’re writing and planning your commercial, meet with the art direc-
tor or creative director of the production facility you’re using so you can see
the computer graphics and effects that are available to you. If you’re going to
spend some serious money on a schedule with a station, you should get a
tour of its production facility and a demonstration of all the state-of-the-art
tricks that you can insert into your spots. Don’t be satisfied to just do
another mundane spot if you can use the latest in computer technology to
enhance and improve your spots and make them into something interesting
and memorable.
Computer graphics by themselves don’t rescue a poorly conceived and badly
written spot. (Garbage in, garbage out.) Start with well-written copy and a
sound, creative premise and go from there.
125
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials

All this computer technology brings with it another, less-obvious benefit: It
cuts your production costs dramatically. Nowadays, the computers make the
entire editing process so fast and painless that you can get in and out of the
editing suite quickly and, therefore, cheaply.
Bringing the Audio and Visual Together
When you’re writing a TV commercial, you need to think visually. Try to pic-
ture in your mind’s eye what you want to appear on the screen as the words
you write are spoken. If you’re selling furniture, for instance, and your copy
opens with a description of a cherry wood bedroom set, does your scene
open with the bedroom set, a wide shot of your entire store, or a beautiful
cherry tree in full bloom? Or do you imagine using all three of these shots in
quick succession? Personally, I would choose the image of the cherry tree,
opening the spot with a shot of the tree and all its pink blossoms, then cut-
ting to the bedroom set you’re featuring, and then zooming out to show the
size of your showroom, or cutting to a shot of the showroom. Or you may
even get really ambitious and place the bedroom set in front of the cherry
tree for a lovely outdoor opening shot.
126
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Professional help is available to you
You are the best person to write the preliminary
draft of the script for your TV spot, because you
know your merchandise better than anyone. At
the very least, you should be the one to write the
fact sheet (the list of relevant facts and features
that should be included in your spot). You are
also the best person to decide where you want
to shoot the commercial — in studio, at your
place of business, outdoors on location, or
wherever — and what merchandise or materi-
als you want to feature in it.
But the TV station from which you are buying
the airtime has all sorts of professional creative
help available to walk you through the process.
The station has copywriters, art directors, pro-
ducers, directors, and editors who are there to
make sure your commercial is as professionally
done as possible. They all want your spot to
generate business for you so you stay with their
station. They want their viewers to respond pos-
itively to your spot, not to tune it out. Because
they don’t want an amateur production going
onto the air, they assist you in many ways to
make sure your commercial looks professional.
They also throw in their two cents when it
comes to creative content, so be sure to listen
to them. They’ve done this thousands of times
before.
If you’re looking for higher quality (and can
afford it), you may want to employ an indepen-
dent production company and professional
director to do all this stuff for you. Most TV sta-
tion production departments are certainly capa-
ble of doing good work, but independent
houses, in an effort to build their own résumés,
often bring a higher level of creativity and pro-
duction skills to the job.

Your opening scene is all-important because it’s the first thing that greets the
viewers, the first thing that either grabs the viewers or causes them to leave
the room to grab a soft drink. When you’re working with a limited budget,
you aren’t able to show a supermodel sitting on the edge of the Grand
Canyon as your opening scene grabber. But you can, with a little thought,
come up with some elements that are creative and eye-catching enough to at
least give your spot a fighting chance at capturing the attention of some
prospective customers.
127
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials
Keeping your budget in mind
Before you go crazy with creative opening
shots, or any shots for that matter, consider your
budget and try to calculate what it will cost you
if, for instance, you must pay for a video crew,
their equipment, their truck, and a location
shoot in order to show that cherry wood bed-
room set sitting outdoors in front of a tree. If you
can afford it, go for it. But an infinite variety of
other shots may work just as well and cost you
far less in production charges.
Discuss production charges with your TV sta-
tion sales rep and haul out the old calculator as
you create your script. I’ve done location shoots
that cost very little in comparison to the final
result, so going outdoors to shoot footage
shouldn’t intimidate you. You can’t expect to
create a TV spot as inexpensively as a radio
spot, but with some advance planning, you can
keep the costs within reason.
Shooting the entire spot in the station’s studio
costs far less than having to go out on location.
And not having to shoot any footage at all is
cheaper still. If, like automakers, your vendors
have footage or still photos available to you,
take advantage of it. Then, by adding a few hun-
dred dollars per hour to pay for an editor and the
rental of an editing suite, your TV commercial
can be ready to go.
All but the tiniest TV stations have editing suites
where you can cut and paste factory footage
(vendor-supplied footage) or still photos into a
finished spot, but not all TV stations have stu-
dios or remote capabilities (with trucks filled
with equipment for on-location shoots). Check
with the station you’re dealing with to see what
production facilities it offers, and, of course,
how much those facilities cost.
Video editors can be your best friends when it
comes time to make a TV spot. These people are
well acquainted with working with rookies and,
with a combination of professional talent and
patience, they guide you through the various
complicated steps required to produce a fin-
ished spot. I’ve gone into an editing suite with
some very definite ideas in mind and tossed
them out when an editor pointed out a better,
more creative, way to do what I wanted to
accomplish. Video editors know how to make
the best product possible within the budget
guidelines set before them. Listen to them,
watch them, and soak in their expertise.

Keep your budget uppermost in your mind. All sorts of creative thoughts
come to you as you begin to write a commercial to sell your product or serv-
ice, but you likely discard many of these as being too unrealistic and expen-
sive to actually include in your spot. Wild horses cost a lot of money, but the
sound of wild horses doesn’t. (For more on your budget, check out the side-
bar “Keeping your budget in mind” or Chapter 2.)
Finish the script before going back and adding the visual elements. Squeezing
everything you want to say into 30 seconds of clear copy is hard enough
without also worrying about what’s appearing on the screen. Do one thing at
a time. Write the copy, then go back and fit the pictures and graphics to the
soundtrack.
To help you write your TV spot, here’s a sample first draft script showing the
audio (the spoken words) in all caps, the video keys (TV production speak for
lettering that appears on the screen either over the footage or as its own ele-
ment), and the video (the camera and staging directions; how you visualize
what needs to happen on the screen as the voiceover talks in the back-
ground) squeezed in between. (V/o stands for voiceover, which is just a voice
speaking from somewhere off-camera.)

This sample is a first draft script, the initial pass through the various elements
that ultimately become a finished spot. At this point in the writing process,
the video keys and the video camera directions that you call out are really
only suggestions — they often change in the editing suite as you and your
production team consider better ideas.
Deciding What to Feature 
in Your Commercial
Are you a good enough actor to star in your own commercial? Do you even
want to? Is your place of business interesting and unusual enough to feature
in your commercial? Or would it be a better idea to just put a camera on the
products you’re selling and let it go at that? The choices are endless — but I
cover the basics in the following sections.
Appearing in your own commercial
You’ve probably seen many spots in which a store owner steps in front of the
camera and does her own commercial. These kinds of commercials can, more
often than not, be a very uncomfortable, even embarrassing, experience for
all concerned — the store owner as well as the viewers. Nothing is more
excruciating than watching someone look foolish for a full 30 seconds, but
that is what some business owners choose to do every time they star in their
own commercials.
On the other hand, you may be a natural and, if you are, then by all means, go
for it. No one else could possibly bring the enthusiasm and expertise that you
can to this endeavor. No one else can ever be as good as you at selling your
business. If you have a strong desire to be your own spokesperson, practice,
practice, practice. Have someone shoot some home video of you doing your
script, and do an objective critique of the finished product. Without stars in
your eyes, ask yourself the following questions:
 Are you believable?
 Do you look comfortable?
 Does your presentation make your audience want to visit your store and
buy something?
 Do you look ill at ease and sound as though you’re reading a script?
Above all, be honest. Only you can decide whether you’re a good enough
actor to pull it off.
129
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials

If you choose to stand in front of the camera and deliver the pitch yourself,
keep in mind that the best opening scene for your spot is probably not a
close-up of you. A close-up only makes you yet another talking head, some-
thing that viewers get far too much of on the various news and entertainment
shows. Instead, find an opening scene that may be a bit more creative than a
headshot of you (even if you do have a million-dollar smile).
If you decide that you’re not the best person to be the spokesperson for your
business, first see if anyone else who works with you could do the job well.
Obviously, this way is a much less expensive than hiring a professional actor,
which requires you to decide what type of person would be best to promote
your business, find the right actor, and have the budget to pay him or her! If
you don’t have someone who fits the bill, keep reading.
Promoting with a professional
You may figure out that neither you, your employees, nor anyone else in your
family can sell your business the way you envision. It may be time to call in a
professional. While you do have to fork out some extra cash, a professional
actor may be just what your business needs.
So how do you go about finding acting talent? The best place to start is to ask
the TV station you’re working with. You can also check out any local acting
agencies by looking in your phone book.
Before you decide on an actor, be sure to ask yourself what type of person
you want to advertise your business in a way that attracts your target audi-
ence. For example, if you own a beauty salon, hiring a burly construction
worker-type to try to sell your recent manicure special may not the best idea.
However, you must also know what type of commercial you want to shoot as
well. If you’re going for more of a comedy, the construction worker advertis-
ing manicures may just work if done right.
Highlighting your place of business
Hiring a remote crew to come to your place of business and shoot the spot
puts your business front-and-center. If your store looks really good, if it’s
nicely decorated and inviting to prospective customers (and, as a matter of
good business, it should be), why not? Plus, shooting footage inside your
store, showroom, studio, office, or gallery may be a lot easier than hauling a
bunch of your products down to a TV station studio or to a remote location —
especially if you’re selling large, heavy merchandise like the cherry wood bed-
room set I mentioned earlier in this chapter. (For more information about
shooting your spot at your business, flip to the section “On location.”)
130
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Focusing the camera on your 
product or service
Go ahead and cut to the chase — immediately show the products you want to
sell with this TV spot. Instead of getting too fancy with long shots of your
location or close-ups of your spokesperson (whether it’s you or a hired pro-
fessional), you may be better served by getting right down to business and
featuring the items that are going to make you some money.
You can never go wrong by showing an item and price in a TV spot. For exam-
ple, if you’re selling power tools, line them up in an attractive display, lay in
some computer graphics to show the prices (video keys), and use a
voiceover to explain why your store is the only store to sell these power
tools so cheap. Nothing too complicated. Just a good, hard-sell spot that can
generate some business for you.
If you opt to focus on your product, you can still use voiceover talent to read
a script highlighting the important features.
Figuring Out Where to Shoot
When you’ve purchased a fairly hefty schedule on one of your local TV sta-
tions, and you’ve written a script and outlined the visual elements you want
to include, you’re ready to go into production. You have two basic options: a
location shoot or an in-studio shoot. In the following sections, I outline what
you can expect from both options.
On location
If you’re going to shoot on location, the first thing you need to do, of course,
is to find the location. It could be the interior or exterior of your place of
business, or it may be a scenic park or point of interest in your area. For
example, I’ve done location shoots all over Northern California, including at
the local zoo, shopping centers, restaurants, parks, and upscale neighbor-
hoods. The location you choose depends on what you’re selling and what
kind of place can add something to your commercial.
131
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials

Shooting at many locations isn’t always free, and you may have to go through
a bit of bureaucratic nonsense in order to shoot there. You may need signed
permission to use certain locations such as public parks and some shopping
centers. Many public facilities also charge you a rental fee to use their loca-
tions in a commercial. Don’t just show up at your local zoo with a video crew
and start shooting. You may get into trouble and end up costing yourself a lot
more money than you would have by going through the proper channels. If
you’re using an independent production company, it usually takes care of
these details for you. But don’t expect a television station crew to care one
way or another.
In the following sections, I give you some tips on how to get ready for shoot-
ing your commercial. I also describe what you can expect from the video
crew and the process of actually shooting your TV ad.
Preparing for the shoot
Scout the location for camera positions and backgrounds before your video
crew shows up. They’re charging you by the day, the half-day, or the hour. So
don’t waste their time (and your money) scouting the location after they
arrive — have these details all planned in advance.
132
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Where to find great ideas
Some of the industry’s best directors, produc-
ers, camera people, lighting specialists, sound
technicians, and editors are working on music
videos. Creative ideas on staging, backgrounds,
editing, computer graphics, and computer-gen-
erated effects are offered up 24-hours a day,
and you can discover a lot by simply watching a
few music videos. You can see the cutting edge
in video-production techniques — which you
can then emulate and incorporate into your own
video productions.
Especially observe their editing techniques,
how they use different effects when they cut or
dissolve from scene to scene, and how they
sometimes go from color footage to black and
white with wonderful effectiveness. You can
make your own TV commercial a thing of beauty
if you use some of these state-of-the-art effects
in your production. Computers make it not only
possible, but also very inexpensive.
Another great place to find new ideas is 
in the commercials produced for national 
advertisers — the commercials you see every
time you turn on the TV. If you see something
that really attracts your attention, some effect
or editing trick that jumps out at you, by all
means talk to your station creative people about
it. Chances are they can help you incorporate
the idea into your spot.

Drive or walk around the park, or whatever locale you’ve selected, and
choose scenes that are attractive and that allow access for the video crew
and their van. Keep in mind that the crew comes complete with a van that
holds all the electronics, a generator, video monitors, sound equipment, and
so on. The van is a self-contained, traveling production facility, and during
the shoot it must be very close to the camera, so you need to take this into
consideration when scouting your location.
Introducing . . . your crew
The video crew for a location shoot usually consists of a director, a director
of photography (DP), also known as a shooter (the cameraperson), a sound
technician, and perhaps a couple of grips. Grips are responsible for setting up
and moving equipment and for holding reflectors to aid the cameraperson in
lighting. Interns or some other entry-level people may also be along on the
shoot as gophers (as in “go-pher this, and go-pher that”).
Getting down to business
The crew arrives in a van at the location you’ve chosen and spends the first
half-hour or so wandering around sipping their coffees or soft drinks. The
director (who may be doubling as the shooter) wanders around with you to
see where you want to shoot the various scenes. He makes some mental
notes about camera angles and lighting.
Whether the star of the commercial is you or a professional talent you’ve
hired, the crew wires your talent with a miniature microphone, a battery
pack, and a transmitter, or the sound may be recorded from a distance on a
directional mic held by a sound technician. The sound technician in the van,
through earphones, tests all of this gear for clarity. If the shoot has a really
big budget, the crew may also include a makeup artist and a hairstylist to
make the talent look as good as possible.
The talent is asked to stand in the first selected scene, and the grips are
directed to set up the lights or reflectors (aluminum-foil-covered panels that
are used to direct available sunlight onto the talent). The shooter sets up the
camera on a tripod, and the grips anchor it with canvas bags filled with lead
shot. The camera is focused. And you and the director, on the monitors
inside the van, can study the view through the lens. The talent’s voice level is
given a final test and, when all things are ready, the first scene is laid down on
videotape or film.
If you’ve selected more than one scene, the entire process must be repeated
until the whole spot, scene by scene, has been shot and is, in the vernacular,
in the can. Each scene is not necessarily shot in order. You may begin with the
final scene and work your way to the beginning — this decision is the direc-
tor’s call and often depends on the layout of the location you’ve selected.
133
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials

In order to avoid confusion later on, each scene is slated — the grip holds a
board on which is written the spot name and scene number in front of the
camera lens for a moment (that’s the black board with a clapper you’ve seen
in movies when the director calls, “Action!”). Another way to indicate the
start of a scene is for an engineer in the van to write a brief description of
each scene and its position on the recorded tape on a sheet of paper. Either
way, this helps the director and video editor identify each scene when it
comes time to do the final editing back at the studio.
In the studio
Shooting your commercials in a studio is much less expensive than shooting
on location, and it may make a lot of sense if you need to shoot multiple com-
mercials or rotate new spots in on a regular basis. In the studio, you also
have much more latitude with camera setups than you do on location. For
instance, the camera can be set on a dolly, which is a platform on wheels that
runs on tracks. The grips pull the dolly slowly along the tracks as the shooter
rides on top of the dolly. The effect is a smooth lateral movement that adds
interest to an otherwise static, boring camera setup.
In the following sections, you can familiarize yourself with what’s involved
when shooting at the studio so you can determine whether it’s a good option
for your own TV ad.
Sizing up the studio and its crew
The studio most television stations use for shooting commercials is a very
large space with a very high ceiling from which hang rack upon rack of lights.
You probably can’t see any sharp corners where the walls meet the floor.
Instead, this space is gently coved and is called a cyclorama (or a cyc for
short). This smooth edge where the walls meet the floors creates the illusion
of infinity, a space with no beginning, no end. The floor is cement and is usu-
ally polished. The studio may also contain the news program set — the set
you see each time you tune into the station’s local news programs.
The production crew consists of the director (a station employee); a camera-
man (called the shooter); a sound technician; two grips to handle props,
move background scenery, set up camera dollies, and so on; as well as any
makeup artists or stylists.
Outlining the process
Prior to the shoot, the entire script is transcribed to the teleprompter, a
screen that sits just slightly above the camera lens. The talent can then read
the copy while appearing to look directly into the camera. Your favorite
newscasters, while dramatically shuffling through stacks of paper placed
before them on a desk, are actually reading the news stories off of a
teleprompter.
134
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Props that you want to use in the spot are placed into the scene, the talent
takes her place, and a piece of tape is stuck to the floor where the talent can
stand. This place is called the mark. The teleprompter is manned by one of
the grips who rolls the copy up or down in synchronization to the talent’s
reading speed, the camera is brought to the correct speed, and everyone is
ready for the first take.
If you have a well-rehearsed professional doing the read, one take may be all
you need, but I’ve always done five or six takes just for insurance. When you
take the tape into the editing suite, you may see something you missed while
doing the actual shoot, so it’s good to have several backup takes just in case,
especially if the talent has gone home and you don’t have a chance to shoot
another take.
The makeup artist, with her box of magic brushes and powders, usually
stands by in the studio ready to touch up any blemishes and to dry off per-
spiration on the talent caused by the banks of hot lights.
This process is repeated as often as necessary until the director, the producer
(that’s you — or the producer you’ve hired), the shooter, and everyone
involved are satisfied that the spot is complete, that it’s as good as it’s going to
get, and that it’s ready for final editing. The process is very creative every step
along the way, and you can have fun doing it — I know I do. I’ve shot hundreds,
if not thousands, of retail TV spots, and it’s a kick each and every time I do it.
The people you work with are experts in their fields and are there to help you.
They’re a very creative bunch, so listen to their suggestions and follow their
directions. Your final product will be that much better because you did.
Producing Your Commercial
When you produce a TV commercial, you can either use the TV station’s pro-
duction department or you can hire an independent production house to do
it for you. I cover both options in the following sections.
Using the TV station’s production 
department
Chances are the TV station from which you’re buying a schedule of advertis-
ing time has a fairly good production department. If for some reason the sta-
tion doesn’t, you may want to buy your schedule from a different station.
You’re going to produce a commercial, and you may not want to incur the
expense of using an independent production house. Even if the station you
select doesn’t have all the latest electronics bells and whistles, it’s probably
capable of putting together a good local commercial for your business.
135
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials

When you sign the contract to buy an airtime schedule, arrange to get a tour
of the station’s production facility and make sure you get to meet the two
most important players, the two creative-types who help you produce your
commercial:
 The Retail Production Manager is the person who oversees all the com-
mercials produced for the retail clients of the station. It’s this person’s
job to arrange studio and editing times; assign and schedule shooting
crews for studio and location sessions; arrange for props, studio back-
drops, makeup artists, and hairstylists; and assemble all the many
pieces that go into a production session. Everyone who works in the
production department answers to this person — you want to be very
nice to the Retail Production Manager.
 The Video Editor is the person with whom you ultimately share the dark
and claustrophobic confines of the editing suite. It’s this person’s job to
stitch together all the pieces of your commercial — the video, sound-
track, computer graphics, special effects, and so on — into a coherent
136

How to get free production
The media director for my agency has been able
to get free production for our retail clients so
often that they almost expect it every time. How
is this done? Simple. It’s called negotiation.
When we make a substantial buy on a station,
we always grind the sales rep and sales man-
ager a bit in order to get the best deal possible.
We rarely buy a schedule as it’s initially pre-
sented. We always look for something extra,
whether it be more spots for the same dollars or
our spots running in better dayparts (time peri-
ods) than were initially offered. And the one
area where we always try to get something
extra is in production. If we buy a hefty airtime
schedule, we always ask for a production credit
so we’re able to cut the cost of producing our
commercials. The production credit is money
that may or may not cover all the expense of
producing commercials, but it usually makes a
huge dent in the overall cost. Most stations
cave in to this request if it’s the difference
between getting the airtime schedule or not.
Quite frankly, production charges from local TV
stations aren’t that high. As a matter of fact,
they’re usually quite reasonable, and my clients
hardly notice the costs when added to our
monthly invoices. I’ve never had a client com-
plain that these charges were out of line. But if
you can save the cost of production and then
pass along the savings to your clients, why 
not ask?
Often, in the case of cable TV stations and some
small independent broadcast TV stations, free
production of one commercial is offered as part
of the schedule — you don’t even need to ask.
The station can hardly sell you a spot schedule
if you don’t have a commercial to put on the air,
so it throws a production session into the deal.
They may not bring a lot of enthusiasm or cre-
ativity to the event, however, so be sure to stay
on top of them when it comes time to actually
do the shoot and the editing.

and concise 30 seconds of brilliance that viewers actually notice and
remember. This person knows which buttons to push to make commer-
cials look wonderful, and video editors typically overflow with ingenious
ideas to make commercials better.
Hiring an independent production house
If you need something extra in the way of production capabilities, something
that the production department of your local TV station simply can’t offer,
find an independent production company. The Retail Production Manager of
your local station may be able to point you in the right direction. Or you may
find a few possibilities in your local Yellow Pages under “Video Production
Services.” Avoid the ones that list themselves as wedding specialists or 
specialists in some other field, because they won’t be equipped to handle
commercial jobs.
Interview the companies you find, tell them what you’re after, and have them
show you their sample reel (an example of their work), so you can judge
whether they have the skills to create television commercials from initial
camerawork through the final editing process. Also, be sure to get a quote 
in advance. If you’re like me, you hate surprises.
Editing Your Commercial
The editing suite is grandly named, but it’s actually just a small, dark room
into which tons of electronic equipment has been jammed. Somewhere
behind the video editor, you can find a chair for you, the producer. You have
a good view of all the monitors and are able to control (or at least participate
in) all the action.
The video editor, who has edited commercials thousands of times before, has
a copy of your script and, with nonchalance, assembles all the pieces into a
finished 30-second commercial that you can be very proud of. Most impor-
tantly, the video editor is there to make you look good (as are the director,
the shooter, and all the other people involved with your project). Listen to
your editor’s suggestions. Watch and learn. Nothing drives an editor crazier
than clients who think they know more about the process than the editor
does. Video editing is a very technical and precise talent — a talent that takes
years to perfect, years of sitting in that claustrophobic, little, dark room
pushing buttons and winding tape. So do yourself a favor — give the editor
free rein and enjoy the final result.
137
Chapter 9: Demystifying TV Commercials

First, the sound track (the audio) must be inserted into the master file (which
becomes your final commercial). Then, all the videotape you shot, either on
location or in the studio is, after having been digitized, brought up on one of
the monitors in front of the editor. The editor rolls through the footage, and
you both select the takes that comprise the final commercial. Each selected
take is timed and inserted into the master file piece-by-piece until a full 30
seconds is stitched together into a finished spot. If you want any of the
scenes to fly or spin into the commercial, these computer effects are
selected, designed, and inserted.
Any computer graphics — prices, product features, important copy points —
are then typed by the editor and inserted into the spot, as is a music back-
ground (if any) and your logo, which appear at the end of the commercial
along with your phone number, address, directions, or whatever you want. If
the spot requires a disclaimer of any kind, this too is typed by the editor and
inserted into the spot in the appropriate place. You may help select the fonts,
sizes, and colors of the graphics, or at least put in your two cents’ worth.
When you add up the writing time, the shooting time, and the editing time,
even though most of the process is done using the most powerful computers,
the entire procedure of producing a 30-second TV commercial can actually
take days. But, at the end of the editing session, you walk out of the editing
suite with a finished commercial in the can, ready for air — and ready to
entice customers into your business where they will, you hope, spend lots of
money. Have fun with it — producing TV commercials can be very exciting!

Collateral Advertising and 
Direct Mail: Brochures, Flyers,
Newsletters, and More
In This Chapter
 Creating a top-notch collateral plan
 Taking your budget into account
 Keeping your design and copy simple and clear
 Working with a printer or a design professional
 Using a direct-mail house with top-notch mailing lists
W
hen you invest your money into writing and designing business-
collateral materials, you invest in a first impression. Collateral 
materials are the brochures, mailers, flyers, and newsletters you produce 
for your business, all of which make an impression on your customers — 
and potential customers. Whether the impression is a good one resulting in
increased business or a bad or ambivalent one that ends up being a gigantic
waste of your money is entirely up to you.
Although many businesses use collateral materials to introduce a business 
or product, unlike other forms of advertising, you can also use it later in the
sales cycle, usually when you’ve identified your prospective purchasers and
you’re making contact with them. Collateral advertising often supports the
sales of your product or service as well. These sales aids are intended to
make the salesperson’s job easier and more effective.
You can distribute collateral ads to your customers in a variety of ways, such
as through direct mail or as flyers that you can leave in public places that
accept such materials or in your customer’s bags. For a creative mind like
yours, the options are innumerable.

As with all advertising materials, the creative ideas and production values
you put to use in your collateral materials make the difference between suc-
cess and failure. Do it right and you reap the rewards. Do it wrong, as so
many businesses do, and you’ll wish you’d saved your money. This chapter
gives you the information you need so you can start a collateral ad campaign
that best suits your business needs.
First Things First: Planning 
Your Collateral Campaign
A sizeable portion of the hundreds of advertising messages everyone is
exposed to on a daily basis comes in the form of collateral materials. You
open your mailbox every day and find a fresh pile of brochures, catalogs,
newsletters, and flyers. Why do you read some of it and throw the rest away?
If you’re like most people, you’re more likely to pay attention to the materials
that are provocative, with a clean design. And if the piece is easy to read and
simple to navigate, all the better. But the run-of-the-mill stuff, the direct mail-
ers and postcards that don’t display the slightest creativity, that don’t
instantly give you a reason to open and read them, go out with yesterday’s
newspaper.
As with any form of advertising, when it comes to collateral, you need to plan
your work and then work your plan. Invest your time and effort into the plan-
ning of your collateral advertising — plan it as carefully as you would any
important endeavor. The amount of time you put into the planning stage is the
best investment you can make toward the ultimate effectiveness of the piece.
Chapter 5 gives you more detailed information on planning your campaign,
but for collateral advertising in particular, it’s important to remember this:
Don’t just toss together a bunch of words, prices, pictures, and a “Hurry on
down” or “Contact us now,” and hope for the best. It doesn’t work that way.
Before you sit down to create a piece of collateral advertising, plan by doing
the following:
1. Define the purpose for the ad. Are you trying to reach new customers
or to inform existing customers?
2. Determine what you can do within your budget constraints. Rough out
a design and get estimates from printers so you can figure out what you
can afford. See the section “Watching Out for Collateral Budget Busters”
in this chapter or Chapter 2 for more information.
3. Organize your message and crystallize your design. Don’t expect much
involvement from your readers. Make your design and copy clear, infor-
mative, and, above all, brief (see Chapter 4). After you’ve done this, it’s
time to shift your tasks from planning your ad to creating the ad.
140
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

4. Write and rewrite your headline and copy until it’s as concise as it can
be. Make sure no extraneous words are in your headline; make sure it
has sell. (Check out Chapter 19 for some tips on writing ads.)
5. Toss out any superfluous elements from your ad that only distract
from your message. Be as objective as possible when tightening your
design and copy. Include only those elements that are absolutely neces-
sary to getting your message across.
6. Do sketches and rearrange the elements until the design is a good as
it can be. Don’t just toss your various elements together helter-skelter.
Be thoughtful in your design. Make it attractive and easy to grasp.
7. Make sure your copy and content flow in a logical sequence. Don’t be
pompous, ponderous, and boring with too much copy or irrelevant infor-
mation. Your target audience doesn’t have time for it.
8. Be objective. Is the piece reader-friendly? Does it quickly communicate a
benefit? Would you read it if you found it in your mailbox?
Keep in mind that creating collateral advertising is very similar to creating
print ads. See Chapter 7 for more information that you can apply to your 
collateral advertising.
If you write and design your brochure sequentially and if you take it one step
at a time and make sure you complete each step with precision, then your fin-
ished piece stands a good chance of success.
Watching Out for Collateral 
Budget Busters
If you keep your collateral plan in place (as I discuss in the preceding sec-
tion), you can go a long way toward keeping your advertising affordable. The
more elaborate the piece, the costlier it is. So you need to ask yourself, “What
can I afford?” And then stick to that budget. Chapter 2 gives you information
on how to establish your budget and stay within it.
If your business or location doesn’t allow you to easily distribute or mail col-
lateral ads to your customers on your own, you should also make sure you
set aside part of your budget for a direct-mail provider. I cover that in the sec-
tion “Handing Off the Dirty Work: Direct-Mail Houses” later in this chapter.
For now, though, I concentrate on the budget of your ads themselves.
As with all advertising, if you get carried away designing something that, in
the final analysis, has a printing cost of $5 a unit and you can only afford $1 a
unit, you probably have to go back to the old drawing board. In collateral
advertising, two items in particular can overinflate your budget in a hurry if
you aren’t careful: color and printing costs.
141
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail

In the following sections, I unravel the costs of color printing and offer some
less-expensive solutions. I also break down the various types of printers to
give you a better idea of what can work for you (and your bottom line).
Adding a little (or a lot) of color
Today, buying a personal color printer can cost as low as $500, but if you add
just one color to your collateral advertising, you may add a few more zeros to
your overall printing costs. Add two or three more colors, and you may be in
for a serious dose of sticker shock. In addition, paper costs alone have sky-
rocketed over the years, and professional printers have never been embar-
rassed about charging a lot of money for their work. Be sure you know what
you’re getting yourself into before you design something so elaborate that
you can’t afford it. I talk about color in more detail later in the chapter, but
you really do need to know up front: The more color you use, the bigger your
budget should be.
You can get away with producing a very nice and relatively inexpensive piece
in just one color: black. If what you’re saying is strong and if what you’re
showing is interesting, then black ink on a white background may do the job
nicely.
I receive postcard-size mailers on a weekly basis from local real estate agents
showing off their listings. They include a photo of the house, a brief descrip-
tion, the asking price, and a photo of the agent. These pieces of collateral
advertising are well-designed with easy-to-understand copy, and if I were in
the market for a new home, they would be quite effective in arousing my
interest. They’re all printed on glossy card stock in black and white. Nothing
could be simpler — and the costs are relatively low, too.
Printing cheap: No such thing?
Printing isn’t cheap — unless you do it yourself, and even then, you have the
cost of investing in a high-quality paper and toner cartridges, which increase
considerably if you buy a color printer. The number of pages, colors, photos,
die-cuts, and clever folds you design into your piece is in direct proportion to
your blood pressure when you get the cost-of-printing estimate. As a rule,
quick print jobs usually cost a few cents per copy. The major-league brochure
jobs cost a few dollars a copy. Be sure you remember these dollar signs
before you even begin to design your ad.
Also keep in mind that the type of printer you use affects costs, because
printing prices vary widely according to the capabilities and equipment of
each printer. Check out the following printing options:
142
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

 National chain shops: The national chain copy shops (FedEx Kinko’s,
Staples, and Office Depot) have given small businesses many more print-
ing options. These quick-print specialists are very good at producing
small jobs where cost is more important than quality. You can either
visit your local branch or check out their services online, simply by
uploading the document you want printed.
 Large printing firms: Large printing firms that have presses that cover a
square city block are capable of doing the most exquisite work — if you
have the budget for it.
 Printers specializing in small to mid-size jobs: Other printers are
experts in small to mid-size jobs, such as letterheads, envelopes, and
business cards — they’re also qualified to do brochures, flyers, mailers,
and the like.
The key is to pick the type of printer who can handle (at a cost you can
afford) the type of printing you need. I use one local printer for my company
newsletters, corporate image items, and one- or two-color mailers. Located in
a small strip mall, this printer does great work and charges a very reasonable
price for smaller jobs. But for full-color, multi-page extravaganzas, I go to a
large firm that has a huge press and the binding capability (collating and 
stapling the pages together) that is required when producing large brochure
jobs.
Another factor affecting costs is how many prints you need. Typically, the
per-unit cost goes down the more items you print. For that reason, printing
5,000 units is often more economical than printing just 1,000.
If you only need 1,000 copies for a particular mailing, you can save money in
the long run by printing 5,000 and then, at a later date, imprinting the addi-
tional pieces with information relevant to a future sale or announcement.
With advance planning, you can save a lot of money on printing costs. For
example, I have a client who does regular mailings to his list of current cus-
tomers — about 2,500 people. We generally print 10,000 pieces, which are
designed with space for updated copy that can be printed in one color later.
By printing 10,000 units the first time around and then sending the brochure
with updated copy and a new sales message in four separate mailings, this
client saves a ton of money on printing bills.
Although printing services are everywhere, good printers are a little more
rare. To find a suitable printer, ask other small businesses in your neighbor-
hood which printers they use, thumb through the Yellow Pages, or if you hire
a graphic designer (see “Hiring a pro to do the design work for you” later in
the chapter), let the designer advise you.
143
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail

The single most-important factor to any printing project is the final proofing
of the artwork before you release it to the printer. Even though you have the
opportunity to see a final proof from the printer prior to the actual press run
(usually called a blue line), any changes or corrections that aren’t on the orig-
inal artwork are charged back to you at a premium rate.
If you decide to buy your own color printer, you need to know the volume of
pages you’ll be printing per month, then check the number of pages per
minute that your printer can handle: For example, one model of Brother
printer can print 30,000 pages a month. Also check the paper stock the
printer can handle, depending on what you want: Heavy stock can sometimes
be difficult, so if you need to print on heavy paper, you’ll need to get a printer
that can handle that (not all printers can). Finally, check the resolution (the
number of dpi, or dots-per-inch). Remember, you want your collateral adver-
tising to look great.
144
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Digital printers: When you have the need for speed
Digital printing is printing a finished product
directly from a computer or a CD. Years ago, you
had to create a paste-up (a hand-assembled,
full-size facsimile containing all the elements of
your finished brochure) or film (a picture of your
final paste-up) and take it to a traditional offset
printer for printing. But printing has evolved so
that most printing is now done digitally, where
all you need to do is give a disk or upload an
electronic file to a printer or copy shop. Digital
printing offers you the following advantages:
 You get a quicker turnaround time.
 Making changes (even at the last minute)
is less expensive, because you can change
your file so easily.
 Short runs (a relatively small number of fin-
ished pieces) are more affordable.
 You can print ads on any paper stock.
 You can merge the ad with a mailing list to
print addresses directly onto the pieces.
Your computerized mailing list is fed into the
press, and each address is imprinted on the
individual mailing pieces as they run
through the press. This process eliminates
the need for later affixing mailing labels to
each printed piece and saves money at the
mailing house.
Digital printing has become crucial to busi-
nesses that may want to test the waters with a
particular brochure without printing zillions of
copies and spending huge amounts of money.
Last-minute digital printing of jobs such as
trade-show flyers, price lists, and pamphlets
has bailed out many a company with the need
for speedy, last-minute collateral pieces or mul-
tiple copies of a new press release. Turnaround
time for the average digital printing job is mea-
sured in days, not weeks, and they can some-
times be done in 24 hours.

Designing the Best Collateral Ads 
for Your Business
Collateral advertising has numerous purposes — and the different kinds of
collateral advertising at your disposal are numerous as well. You should
research carefully, always keeping your budget in mind, to determine which
form of collateral advertising best suits your needs. Types of collateral ads
include:
 Brochures: These can be anything from a single sheet, folded in two or
three, to a stapled booklet that’s almost a mini-catalog, either in one
color printing or more. You can leave brochures behind with prospec-
tive clients at the end of a sales presentation. You can also keep a stack
of them on the counter at your place of business or send them as direct
mail. You can also send out brochures to people who request more infor-
mation about your business.
 Postcards: Just like the 4-x-6-inch cards you send from vacation to your
family and friends back home, these postcards are typically a picture of
your product, your service in action, or some other aspect of your busi-
ness, with brief info on the back, perhaps announcing an upcoming sale
or other news. These puppies are ideal for reducing cost and getting
read without having to be opened. Postcards can be sent to current cus-
tomers to announce an upcoming sale, perhaps including a perforated
coupon or return card good for a preferred-customer discount. Figure 10-1
shows an example of a very effective postcard.
 Newsletters: These can be as simple as a page (kind of like those typed
letters you get from long-lost friends at holidays, telling you what every-
one in the family has been doing during the year) to 4 pages or even 16
pages. Many small business owners (and consultants) write their own
newsletters, to keep their company’s products and services uppermost
in their customers’ minds. Your newsletter could provide information on
trends in the industry; news and reviews of new products or services —
either your own or others’; or just fun-to-read articles that your cus-
tomers may enjoy.
 Business cards: These need no explanation: They’re an evolution of the
old-fashioned “calling cards” that provide your name, your business’s
name, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, Web site, and
any other contact info you want to include. Some people include their
photo — a great idea for customers who are more likely to remember
your face than your name. Or you might include a picture of your store-
front or office on the front of the card, with your contact info on the
back. Anything that makes your card stand out from the rest in the
Rolodex is helpful!
145
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail

 Electronic direct mail: Whether via e-mail, Web content, or text messag-
ing, electronic direct mail is the fastest-growing area of direct mail.
Check out Chapter 6 for more info on Web-based and e-mail advertising.
 Freebies and samples: These tchotchkes are small, dimensional devices
relevant to your business, product, or ad campaign. They can include a
product miniature, a free sample, a toy, or another creative element.
Whatever you’re trying to accomplish, a collateral piece, in one or more of its
many forms, can do the job. How well it does the job is up to you.
Even though collateral advertising should be a stand-alone advertising vehi-
cle and must contain selling points and a call to action, it hardly ever makes a
sale on its own. Instead, it’s an integral piece of the overall advertising
puzzle. A glossy, well-designed collateral piece can say a lot about your busi-
ness (for example, that you’re a classy business that sells classy products or
provides a luxury service), and, if it’s done right, it can play on the emotions

Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Just as with broadcast commercials (see Chapters 8 and 9) or print ads
(Chapter 7), the collateral material you use as part of your overall advertising
strategy must make an instant impression on the recipient — a positive
impact that compels the consumer to open, read, and respond. Writing and
designing these materials isn’t any big mystery. The same elements you
strive for in other media are the ones you should strive for in this media as
well: an interesting design; clear, concise copy; the promise of something to
benefit the consumer; and a call to action.
You can’t expect much involvement from the reader in your brochure — 
actually, you can’t expect any involvement, only a cursory glance at best. 
So the simpler your message, the better.
Deciding what to include in your ad
Whether you’re preparing an elaborate multi-page, multi-color collateral
piece such as an overview of what products or services your company offers
or a simple black-and-white postcard destined to be mailed to a preferred
customer list, the rules are the same:
 Keep it attractive, relevant, simple, and, above all, reader friendly.
 Don’t expect the recipients to give it much time (they’re on the receiving
end of tons of this stuff, just like you are).
147
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail
Paying attention to what you read
A good place to start when deciding on a col-
lateral ad design for your business is to ask
yourself, “Why do I read some of the collateral
advertising I receive, and why do I toss the
rest?” What is it about the design and layout, or
the written promise, of some pieces that grabs
your attention, and even compels you to
respond? If you can answer this question,
you’re on your way to designing your own suc-
cessful piece, because the design and copy ele-
ments that work on you may also work on your
customers.
If you find a brochure that you really like, save it.
As a matter of fact, collect all the ones you like
and make a file. I’m not suggesting you plagia-
rize these, but they can be a great source of
inspiration. For example, I have a client who’s
saved nearly every direct-mail piece, in-store
promotional piece, brochure, pamphlet, and
flyer he’s come in contact with for decades. The
guy uses direct mail on a regular basis and
always needs new ideas. He keeps huge scrap-
books of this stuff to use as references when
he’s preparing his own collateral pieces. He
doesn’t copy them verbatim; he uses them to
jumpstart his own imagination.
If you can train yourself to do some subjective
analysis of the design and copy of brochures
and pamphlets that appeal to you, you can then
put this newfound design sense to work in your
own advertising.

 Use interesting graphics and a provocative headline to interest them
enough to at least give the piece a fighting chance at being opened and
read.
 If you have room anywhere in your ad, and if you’re selling a product
that can be shipped to the customer, it’s helpful to include an order
form, like the one shown in Figure 10-2.

Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

When you’re designing a collateral piece, include only those elements that
are essential to your message and avoid the temptation to incorporate too
much information. Think about whether a particular graphic element focuses
your readers’ attention, or whether it only confuses them. If you’ve included
something in your collateral advertising that is pure ornamentation and is, in
fact, a distraction, toss it out and start again. For example, as mentioned, a
picture of you or your business or products is helpful (for customer recall),
but artwork that’s only used to break up text isn’t.
In the following sections, I outline the various elements of a good collateral
piece and show you how to make each element help to deliver your all-
important sales message.
Putting the important copy points at the top
When you’re organizing the words (or copy) that go into your ad, imagine a
stepladder. Put your most important copy points on the top step, the next
most-important points on the next step down, and so forth. Make a list of the
various components that you want to include in your brochure, ranking the
elements from the most important to the least. Then feature the most-signifi-
cant points more boldly in order to make an instant impact on the reader.
For example, if you’re creating a piece announcing a sale or other special
event, get right to the point and make the line at the very top of your ad say
what’s most important: “Sale!” Don’t get cute and make the first thing the
reader sees something like, “Due to continued customer demand. . . .”
Write an eye-stopping headline and brief, succinct body copy. Don’t confuse
your readers with a long-winded explanation of how to build a watch; just tell
them, in plain English, why they should buy a watch from you. The difference
between having your piece read or having it tossed into the garbage is the
split second it takes for your recipient to be either intrigued or bored.
Don’t be reluctant to throw out unnecessary copy the brochure can live with-
out. Pare down your list of copy points to the bare-bones selling message. Get
rid of the superfluous and concentrate on the important. The less work you
create for the recipient, the better. Make it easy for potential customers to
instantly grasp your message.
Using the right typeface
Use a typeface that best expresses the tone of your brochure. Look at the dif-
ferent fonts in your computer word-processing program, and see what
options you have. For example:
 If the piece is meant to be humorous and whimsical, find a typeface
that’s silly or goofy. Keep in mind, though, that the type you choose
needs to be very readable, so make sure you choose a large-enough ver-
sion of these fonts so that the type design doesn’t interfere with your
message, which is the most important factor.
149
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail

 If your piece is serious, like an announcement of a presale open house
for your preferred customers, choose a typeface that’s dignified and
solid.
 If you’re sending out a mailer to announce a big sale, use a typeface that
is big, bold, and direct. You can find lots of examples of these — but
beware of using type that’s too bold, because that’s distracting for read-
ers. Use boldface type judiciously, to call attention to the most impor-
tant message in your advertising piece.
Don’t use more than two or three different typefaces in your collateral adver-
tising. Numerous typefaces tend to confuse and distract the reader’s eye
rather than focus it. Also, where possible, avoid underlines, boldfaces, italics,
outlines, borders, stars, bars, and any other visual distractions. These cutesy
elements only add clutter and distract your readers from your message.
Including graphic elements
Your graphic choices are many and varied — everything from photographs to
full-color drawings, black-and-white line art to a clever typeface treatment.
Choose the graphic element that best conveys the essence of what you’re
trying to sell, and what you’re attempting to accomplish with the printed
piece you’re creating.
If you’re showing a particular product that is now on sale, then a photograph
(either one supplied by the manufacturer or shot by a local photographer)
may be the way to go. Show the item, give the price or the call to action (for
example, “This dress marked down 50 percent this weekend only”), and make
sure these elements jump off the page quickly.
Use graphics if they add to the sell of the piece. Don’t include graphics purely
as design elements if they just distract from the message. Don’t clutter your
design with multiple graphic images unless each of them has some relevance
to the piece. The biggest mistake made by retail advertisers is trying to fit
too much information into a single ad. Jamming too much information into a
single piece only confuses the reader.
Considering color
Here again, multiple colors increase your printing costs. And, although color
does add interest and impact, it’s not always necessary. You can do many
effective brochures and mailers in black and white. The message and design
is what makes or breaks your sales piece, not the addition of several colors.
You can also print one color on a contrasting color paper. Printing papers
come in nearly infinite varieties and colors. A nice shade of blue ink on a
cream-colored paper may work as well as four-color process on white paper
if your message and design are well planned and executed.
150
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

On the other hand, certain brochures simply cry out for four-color process. If
you’re selling something — food, clothing, fine art — that must be shown in
all its multicolored glory, then you want to go the full-color route. A prospec-
tive customer may have trouble picturing the beauty of a painting, for
instance, if you did your sales piece only in black and white.
Choosing the right paper 
Printing involves more than color and ink. Printing papers come in numerous
colors, textures, weights, and finishes. Coated paper (which is usually slick
and glossy) gives more depth and brilliance to your piece and reproduces
photographs much better, even if it’s only printed with black ink. Soft-finish,
textured papers are perfect for a classy brochure or for letterheads and cards
that require a solid business image. You can also save a tree by using recy-
cled paper (and then tell the world about it in little, tiny type inside your
brochure), but keep in mind that some recycled papers cost more.
The different weights (thickness and heft) of paper give you multiple choices
when you produce collateral. You can use heavy weights for postcards and
brochure covers, light weights for mailers stuffed into envelopes, and so on.
Paper samples come in small demonstration packets prepared by numerous
paper companies. Your printer trots out paper samples until you’re cross-
eyed with confusion, and then he hauls out a bunch more. You may want to
find out which papers are available to you before you get too far in your
brochure design. Paper is an integral part of the brochure-design equation. A
paper with a rich appearance and feel adds greatly to the ambience of your
finished piece. Your printer can help you make your choice.
Getting help with your design
You can safely say that anyone can design a brochure. You could design one. I
could design one. Even your kid — the one who shows great aptitude for
drawing lovely pictures or coloring within the lines — could design one. But,
why send out a piece that looks amateurish and a bit rough around the edges
when you can create something to be proud of with just a little advanced
planning and careful thought?
When creating collateral ads, weigh the costs of hiring someone with the
skills (such as design) or equipment (color printers and so on) to help you
versus doing it yourself. For example, a concert promoter who did a mailing a
few years ago designed her own brochure, using photos she obtained from
the musicians who were performing. She chose to do this herself because
she’s a creative, talented person with a good eye for design.
151
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail

She had a local copy shop print her brochure on heavy stock because her
own printer couldn’t handle that weight of paper. The copy shop also scored
and folded her mailing piece, printed her logo on envelopes, and printed her
labels (which can sometimes be tricky because they’re sticky and can ruin
your toner cartridge if they get stuck).
Finally, she stuffed all the envelopes and labels and applied all the postage
herself. This mailing was a small, though, going out to only about 300 people.
If you’re mailing to thousands, you probably need help; fortunately, you can
outsource all these tasks (check out the section “Handing Off the Dirty Work:
Direct-Mail Houses”) — or you may find it more cost effective to invest in a
color printer and color toner as these costs continue to become more 
affordable.
A collateral piece, whatever form it takes, is a reflection on you and on the
quality of your business. It’s worth some time and effort. I’ve always hired
professional talent to do the jobs that I’m either incapable of doing or don’t
have the time to do right, and I think that’s good advice for you to heed as
well. In the following sections, I cover the various ways you can create a qual-
ity collateral piece. The process involves much more than just typing infor-
mation on paper.
Using design software you may already own
You have access to some excellent collateral-material design templates on
various software programs, and you may already have them on your com-
puter. For example, Microsoft Publisher has a huge variety of templates for
brochures, mailers, postcards, greeting cards, letterheads, and so on.
Software programs also include step-by-step tutorials that are supposed to
transform the design klutz into the design pro. Even if you have no experi-
ence in design, software can be of enormous value. Think of software as sort
of a high-tech paint-by-numbers set. You’re given multiple choices at every
step along the way (cover art, photos, backgrounds, colors, layouts, type
fonts, folds), and you end up with a mailer, brochure, or other item of busi-
ness collateral. You can also use these design programs to help you create
print advertisements and signage.
One caution here: By using these built-in computer design programs, you run
the risk of creating something that may have been done by another company,
perhaps even one of your competitors. The choices on these programs may
look endless, but they have a similar look and feel, and, for the most part,
they’re not very original.
When you’re finished designing the ad, save your final draft to a disk in the
specific file program requested by your printer. Then hand the disk to your
printer, tell him how many copies you want, and take the rest of the day off.
152
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Hiring a pro to do the design work for you
The best way to get the best possible design is, in most cases, to hire a profes-
sional graphic artist to handle these chores for you. A professional designer
can help you with the creation of the piece and also assist you in making the
many printing decisions required — all in all, a good investment. Graphic
designers cost money, but not nearly as much money as a few thousand
poorly conceived, badly designed mailing pieces that no one bothers to read.
Your printer can likely recommend talented graphic designers in your area,
and you can also look in your good old Yellow Pages under “Graphic
Designers.” In my local Bay Area phone book, this list is seven pages long!
Call one or more of your local designers, invite them to your business, and
ask each of them to bring their book (a collection of the designer’s work sam-
ples). A quick scan of the designer’s work can help you choose the right
person for your particular job.
Ask for a copy of the terms and conditions from your designer. Make certain
you have a complete understanding of ownership and what is financially
expected of you in order to receive your final artwork and your final printed
pieces. Some designers expect to be paid again if their artwork is used to
create more than one piece, or if you reuse their artwork to print the piece
again at a later date. Negotiating and agreeing upon a flat buy out (where you
own all rights to the finished artwork) is best. That way, should you choose
to reuse the artwork at a later date, you won’t incur additional charges.
153
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail
Some cautions on buying art and printing
If you’re working with a graphic designer, she
can quite likely have a good idea of the look and
feel of your finished printed piece, and she also
has some definite thoughts as to which printer
she wants you to use. Ask your designer to pro-
vide you with an official Request for Estimate
form, including all the specifications of your
printing job. Important information includes:
 Quantity: The number of pieces to be
printed
 Flat size: The size before folding
 Finished size: The size after folding
 Stock: What quality and color paper the job
is to be printed on
 Ink colors: Which colors will be used
 Screens: The degrees of color
 Half-tones or color separations: The number
of photos
After your designer gives you this completed
form, you can then send it to a few reputable
printers via fax or e-mail. With all the job’s specs
clearly defined on the form, and after determin-
ing the number of pieces you need, you can ask
for printing quotes. Then you can further nego-
tiate with the printers after you receive back all
the quotes. Some printers may substitute a par-
ticular paper your artist has called for with a
house stock (papers they keep on hand) in order
to offer you the lowest price possible. Confer
with your artist regarding any variances found
on the estimate forms.

Handing Off the Dirty Work: 
Direct-Mail Houses
Though it certainly isn’t the only method of getting collateral ads to your cus-
tomers, direct mail is the most-common means. The appeal is easy to under-
stand: With the proliferation of copy shops in the last decade, it’s easier than
ever to have someone else handle all the details for your direct-mail cam-
paign, such as envelope stuffing, folding, sorting, postage, and so on.
In addition to a traditional mailing house, Staples, Office Depot, FedEx
Kinko’s, and most local copy shops now offer this service (onsite and online).
You simply take your finished printing to them, or have your printer deliver it
to them directly, and they take care of the rest. They also furnish you with
the mailing list you require, print the labels, affix the labels to your mailing
pieces, add the postage, sort the pieces by zip code, box them up, and
deliver them to the post office. It sure beats licking envelopes yourself —
though you should weigh the cost of paying someone versus the cost of your
own time if you do some of these tasks yourself.
You might also consider combining your collateral ads with your e-mail or
Web advertising efforts (see Chapter 6 for details). Keep in mind, though, that
you should only contact those customers by e-mail who have expressed
interest in receiving e-mail from you, so that you don’t get banned for spam-
ming people. And if you’re attaching collateral materials — either a postcard
or a brochure or a newsletter — to your e-mails, make sure the format you’re
using in your collateral is something that can be easily opened and read by
your customers. Sending an attachment that doesn’t open or takes forever to
open will only frustrate your customers and make a bad impression — which
is not the way you want to advertise your business!
Asking the direct-mail provider 
some important questions
If you use a graphic artist to design your ad, then she probably knows of a
good mailing house, but just in case she doesn’t, you can locate one using the
Yellow Pages. The only difference from one mailing house to the next is the
quality of their mailing lists. A well-qualified, up-to-date mailing list is the
most-important part of the direct-mail equation. For this reason, ask the mail-
ing house the following questions:
 When was the list last updated? You don’t want to spend your hard-
earned money sending out the direct mail only to have them returned by
the post office as undeliverable. Look for a house that updates its lists
154
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

monthly, quarterly at the very outside. On average, most reputable
direct-mail houses update their lists every six weeks.
 Is the data on the mailing list presorted by carrier routes or 9- or 
11-digit zip codes and certified for accuracy of address information?
You want your lists to be at least presorted by zip codes so that you
receive postage discounts. And the more extensively a mailing list is
detailed (zip code digits, carrier routes, carrier route sequence), the
larger your postage discounts are. And certification of accuracy is
important so that you’re sure you’re getting what you paid for.
 Will a summary report that breaks out the counts by zip code and
other information be made available to me? The summary report gives
the list buyer (that’s you) a snapshot of the list capabilities and detail
(income level, gender, education, and so on) before you make a list pur-
chase decision. The mailing house offers this report free of charge in
most cases.
 Is there a minimum charge? When you decide to buy a mailing list, the
summary report may inform you that a total of 2,200 names are available
on this particular list, and that the cost is $75 per 1,000 names but with a
minimum charge of $250. List companies set a minimum charge on all
lists. What you want to look for when buying a list are minimum charges
buried in the small print.
 Is the list charge for one-time or multiple usage? Typically, a multiple-
use list costs you about three times the cost of a one-time-only use. The
multiple-use list isn’t updated prior to each use, so, if you’re uncertain
about using the list more than once, or if your second or third use of the
list will be at a much later date, buy it for one time only.
 What is the charge for output? Your mailing house shows you a price
list for the various forms of mailing labels. In simple terms, a continuous
form (also referred to as chesire) is the typical (old-fashioned) computer
paper with slotted tracks on either side that comes in boxes and is used
on dot-matrix printers. A computer program prints multiple addresses
on this paper, and a machine at the direct-mail house cuts and glues the
labels to the mailing pieces. Chesire is the cheapest label form. Sticky
labels need to be affixed by hand and may be more expensive. However
you choose to get the job done, the list company either mails you a com-
puter disk or sends the list to you or your direct-mail house electroni-
cally (via e-mail).
 What are my label printing options (laser, inkjet, dot matrix, and so
on)? You can use either traditional sticky labels, or you may decide to
have the addresses printed directly on the mail piece, as many direct
mailers now do, making the mail appear to be more personal so your
readers are less likely to perceive it as “junk mail.”
 Can I include a secondary message on my labels (for example, “pre-
ferred customer”)? These secondary messages, generally with a double-
or triple-spaced separation, go above the recipient’s name and address.
155
Chapter 10: Collateral Advertising and Direct Mail

 Will I receive a verification of mailing from either the post office or
the mailing house? This verification is either the official United States
Postal Service Form USPS 3602 or a form created by the mailing house,
which the USPS then stamps and signs to verify that the mailing was
delivered as ordered.
Form 3602-EZ is a simplified postage statement designed specifically for
small business mailers who are mailing standard mail cards, letters, and
flats and paying via permit imprint. Keep in mind, though, that if your
mail pieces weigh more than 3.3 ounces each (which means that you pay
a piece rate for each piece in the mailing, plus a pound rate for the total
weight of the mailing), then you can’t use this form.
You can easily purchase mailing lists online through various Web sites such
as www.infousa.com or www.salesgenie.com (both of which claim to
own proprietary databases of 210 million U.S. consumers and 14 million U.S.
businesses). Another Web site, www.polk.com, specializes in automotive-ori-
ented lists. You can also type “mailing lists” into an Internet search engine to
find what you’re looking for. These companies provide you excellent, in-depth
research capabilities — before you even purchase a list.
I receive direct-mail pieces that are so far off base that I wonder how in the
heck my name ever found its way to that particular list. Case in point: I
receive mail each month from a singles club inviting me to parties and other
social events where I can meet and mingle with other singles and have a high
old time. Sounds like a lot of fun to me. Of course, the fact that I’ve been mar-
ried for a thousand years would seem to indicate that my address on this list
is a gigantic waste of the advertiser’s money.
156
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Mailing lists: Something for everyone
Mailing lists are increasingly more sophisti-
cated and informative. Mailing houses have
these lists broken down by demographics (age,
race, and so on), geography (zip codes, ethnic
neighborhoods), income, buying habits, home
value, swimming-pool ownership, the works.
Name your requirements, and chances are a
mailing house has the list you’re looking for.
Added to the incredible mix of information is the
term psychographics, which can pinpoint cer-
tain people (for example, “condo-dwelling,
SUV-driving, techie”). You can probably find
more information in the form of mailing lists than
you want or need to know.
Remember: Any direct-mail house can stuff
envelopes. It’s the quality and timeliness of their
lists that you should be most interested in.
Because people move from one place to
another, change their marital status, modify
their buying habits, increase or decrease their
income, and change all sorts of things, mailing
lists must be purged and updated often — every
six weeks is optimum. If you want to send a
mailer to households earning $100,000 and up,
you can find a list that can get the job done.
How up-to-date the list is, however, makes the
difference between all your mailers hitting the
correct homes and a whole bunch of them
being returned.

A good result from a direct mailing is a return of 2 to 3 percent. That’s not
much. If you send 1,000 mailers, that means you may get responses from only
20 or 30 people, and converted responses (sales) from even fewer. But if a few
of those 20 or 30 people spend a lot of money with you, and if their added
business pays for your printing and mailing costs, those 20 or 30 people may
be enough — especially if they become return customers. But the fact that a
good direct-mail campaign brings you only a maximum 3 percent return puts
that much more meaning into the validity of the list to which you’re mailing.
You can never be 100 percent certain that the list you’re buying is completely
current. But you can pressure the direct-mail house to give you assurances
that the list is as valid as it can make it.
Planning your postage
Your good credit allows you to be billed for the design work, printing, mailing
list, and mailing services, but you have to pay for the postage upfront. The
cost of postage is the one item for which the direct-mail house requires you
to pay in advance or, as we say in the agency business, CIA (short for cash in
advance). The direct-mail house must pay for the postage when it delivers
the material to the post office, or it will have had to pay upfront to load
postage into its postage meter. One way or another, the company wants your
check before your mailing moves out its door.
After going through all the trouble and expense of sending out direct mail,
you may be stunned at the number of direct-mail missives that are returned
to you stamped “non-deliverable as addressed.” No matter how good the list,
some of your mail is destined to make a quick roundtrip. You never know
how many people actually read your direct mail, but you sure as heck know
how many people never received it in the first place. Direct mail is likely one
of the more-measurable media, because the returned items just sit there, in
an ever-increasing pile, mocking you. For this reason, most direct-mail houses
use their own return addresses rather than the clients’. That way, you don’t
have to see how many items get returned.

 Signs of the times: The influence of technology on this ad medium
 Analyzing and using the key elements of an effective outdoor ad
 Selecting from the many forms of outdoor advertising
O
utdoor advertising is likely the earliest form of advertising. Before the
billboard became a freestanding structure, advertisers plastered their
snake-oil logos and slogans on rural barns and on the sides of downtown
buildings. And long before that, in an age when most of the population was
illiterate, stores and businesses displayed signs that were pictorial (often
carved) representations of what they were selling — a mortar and pestle for a
drugstore, a tankard of beer for a tavern, a big bloody tooth for a dentist, a
hammer and anvil for a blacksmith, the scales of justice for an attorney, and
so on.
Outdoor advertising (also known as out-of-home advertising), which includes
billboards, bus shelters, subway posters, street furniture (bus benches), sta-
dium displays, mall and airport signs, bus cards, taxi tops, shopping carts,
and a multitude of other forms, has high visibility. Of the hundreds of mes-
sages advertisers expose daily to consumers, I’d guess the majority of them
are outdoors.

Outdoor advertising is relatively small on the advertising food chain, behind
direct mail, television, radio, newspaper, magazine, Internet, and even Yellow
Pages advertising. Still, it’s not insignificant: According to the Outdoor
Advertising Association of America (OAAA), in 2005, advertisers spent $6.3
billion on outdoor advertising, which was 8 percent more than the previous
year. And it can be a highly effective (and affordable) medium when the basic
rules of good advertising are applied — namely, an eye-catching design and
clear, concise copy.
In this chapter, I clue you in to whether outdoor ads are right for your busi-
ness; what your options are in terms of all the different formats and place-
ments; and how you can design the most effective outdoor ad, given the large
size of this medium but also the fact that it doesn’t really support a lot of
copy. In the sections that follow, I’ll show you how and when to THINK BIG
and still get your message across.
Recognizing the Advantages 
of Outdoor Advertising
Outdoor advertising is on display 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
year. It isn’t surrounded by editorial content and competing advertisements
the way newspaper ads are; it doesn’t compete with programming and other
commercials the way radio and TV ads do; it doesn’t interfere with what
someone is doing when browsing the Web, the way online ads pop up; and
you can target it to reach very specific audiences by board location and
neighborhood. Outdoor is exceptionally effective at reaching various ethnic
groups, because you can choose which neighborhoods you want to advertise
in — if you want to reach a Hispanic audience, you can place your ads on
boards in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, and so forth.
Outdoor advertising is ideally suited for
 Building recognition of your name, logo, package, or other icons associ-
ated with your brand
 Targeting an audience geographically
 Assisting prospects and customers with directional information
You can’t throw outdoor advertising out with the trash, reach over and turn it
off, close it out as an electronic intrusion on a computer, or use it to line the
bottom of a bird cage. It sits up there — big, bold, and impressive — to be
read over and over again by passing motorists and everyone who lives in 
the neighborhood. It gives you continual exposure, like a 30-day-long 
commercial — and that’s just what you want.
160
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

Outdoor advertising includes billboards, posters, airport ads, bus signs, mall
posters, bus shelter ads, stadium signs, bench advertising, shopping cart and
gas pump advertising, blimps, banners towed by airplanes — the list is endless.
Who uses outdoor advertising? Here are just a few businesses that do outdoor
ads:
 Radio stations are among the largest buyers of outdoor ads, because the
people viewing the boards are in their cars and are quite likely listening
to the radio — and that’s a great time to remind them of your station.
 Cell phone companies are one of the fastest-growing buyers of outdoor
advertising.
 Fast-food outlets use billboards to attract hungry motorists to specific
locations at highway exits.
 Automobile manufacturers and local dealers use outdoor ads to reach
consumers who are, when they see the ads, sitting in their cars and
trucks.
The top 10 industries that use outdoor ads, according to the OAAA, include
the following:
1. Local services and amusements
2. Media and advertising
3. Retail
4. Insurance and real estate
5. Public transportation, hotels, and resorts
6. Financial
7. Restaurants
8. Communications
9. Automotive: Dealers and services
10. Automotive: Auto access and equipment

Chapter 11: Opting for Outdoor Ads
H&R Block hits a nerve
H&R Block developed a very effective outdoor
campaign a few years back. Capitalizing on the
utter confusion of a tax form, one of the com-
pany’s billboards read: “Subtract line 64 from
line 56 if more than line 56 . . . or call us.”
Although this board used more words than I
believe is optimal, the board worked because it
was humorous and struck a nerve. People
remembered the ad, even though it was long,
because it was so creative.

But outdoor advertising isn’t limited to these types of businesses. Small to
mid-size businesses that have more modest budgets than the types of compa-
nies listed above can use outdoor ads successfully. Small businesses can
make their media buys more affordable by selectively choosing board loca-
tions that are near their stores and businesses. Outdoor advertising allows
you to advertise your products where the ad can be seen by anyone who
drives in the vicinity of your store or business location.
The audience for outdoor advertising is growing steadily as people spend
fewer hours at home with traditional media and more time on the road and in
their cars. What better way to reach people in their cars than with a big, fat
billboard alongside the street or a clever ad on the rear end of that bus that’s
blocking the road up ahead?
Measuring the Effectiveness 
of Outdoor Ads
Because people spend fewer hours at home, where TV, cable, magazines,
newspapers, books, and the Internet all clamor for attention, billboards may
be the way to go when it comes to advertising. People are in their cars more
than ever — daily vehicle trips continue to climb, and the number of cars on
the road seems to grow exponentially. With so many people sitting in traffic
jams, drivers and passengers are stuck with radio and billboards as their only
media options.
So how do you know for sure how many people are reading your ads? Billboard
cost-effectiveness is measured by the Traffic Audit Bureau, which sends out
spotters to sit near billboards and count passing cars. Although many advertis-
ers are local retailers, national sponsors are increasingly using the medium to

Altoids’s refreshing boards
Altoids, the “curiously strong breath mints”
from England, made a big splash on the outdoor
scene a few years back with its wonderfully
creative copy. One board read: “Mints so strong
they come in a metal box.” And another winner
said: “Refreshes your breath while you
scream.” Very little copy, but a whole bunch of
creativity. It was a billboard campaign that put
Altoids on the map in the United States without,
as far as I know, any other media support.

build their brands. Why? Because outdoor advertising is effective and afford-
able, and it just sits there pumping out the message 24 hours a day.
Outdoor has been called a pure advertising medium, and that may be true.
Billboards stand alone without the editorial, programming, and competitive
advertising distractions found in newspapers, magazines, radio, and 
television.
Choosing Among Your Outdoor
Advertising Options
Outdoor advertising takes on many forms. Here are many examples (but not
all of them) of the outdoor vehicles for sale. It makes you wish you had unlim-
ited funds, doesn’t it?
 Off-premise outdoor advertising: This outdoor advertising format
encompasses any outdoor sign used to advertise your business that is
located alongside a road or freeway, in a mall, on a bus, or flying over-
head being towed by a biplane. It is not the sign on the front of your
store or your office door.
 Permanent paints: Permanent paints are huge structures on which the
message is painted on the face or printed on vinyl, which is then
attached to the face of the structure. As you can imagine, these ads are
big and expensive.
 Rotary bulletins: These ads are the largest of the standard billboard
structures, measuring 14 x 48 feet. The advertising copy for rotary bul-
letins is printed on vinyl or painted on panels, which are rotated or
moved between many locations during the term of the contract. They
offer the largest impact in the marketplace and are not only big, but
costly.
 Posters: The industry standard, also called 30 sheets, posters are the
signs you see everywhere. Copy is printed on posting paper and pasted
to the face of the sign. Posters measure 12 x 24 feet. Several posters may
be purchased and displayed throughout the market to achieve what is
known as a showing (the number of boards you have purchased and the
length of time your advertising appears on them). Depending on the size
of your showing, posters can be quite affordable. See Figure 11-1 for an
example of a poster that can be used either indoors or outdoors.
 Junior posters: These posters are approximately 6 x 12 feet. They’re the
same as posters, just half the size (hence the name junior).
Unfortunately, they are not half the cost.
163
Chapter 11: Opting for Outdoor Ads

 Bus shelter ads: Bus shelter ads are 48-x-68-inch posters in backlit
frames that are integrated into bus shelters. They provide 24-hour expo-
sure in heavy-traffic areas.
 Bus-side advertising: This form of advertising is available in four sizes:
• Super Kings: Available only in select markets, you can usually see
these ads located on the traffic-facing or left-hand sides of buses
and extending from wheel well to wheel well.
• Kings: You can affix these ads to the traffic side of buses, but they
are somewhat shorter in length than the Super Kings.
• Queens: Check out these ads on the curb sides or right-hand sides
of the vehicles.
• Tails: As the name implies, the Tails (short for taillights) bring up
the rear and are quite good for reaching a captive audience (such
as you when you’re just sitting there inhaling the diesel fumes).
 Aerial banners: Aerial banners are in-your-face outdoor advertising at
its apex. You’re watching a football game, minding your own business,
when you look up and see an airplane towing a banner that reads: “Eat a
Heap Cheap at Joe’s.” Aerials are flown over sporting events, other spe-
cial events of every description, and even at beaches — areas where
other forms of advertising are nonexistent. This mode of outdoor is also
good for birthday surprises when you really want to show off.
164
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 
Other outdoor media formats
The number of different outdoor advertising
methods you can choose from are almost infi-
nite. In addition to the ones covered in more
detail in this chapter, you can also advertise in
the following places:
 Airships (blimps)
 Bus benches and shelters
 Bus interior cards
 Gas pumps
 In-mall kiosks
 Parking meter cards
 Rest areas
 Restroom walls
 Shopping carts
 Stadiums or arenas
 Subway and commuter rail ads
 Taxi tops
And that ain’t the half of it. Outdoor advertising
takes on so many forms that it can, at times,
become overly intrusive. If you call a local out-
door advertising company, you can get a full list
of what’s available to you. I’d need another book
this size to describe them all.

Chapter 11: Opting for Outdoor Ads

Designing Memorable 
Outdoor Advertising
The number of options for outdoor ads may seem overwhelming, but the
processes for designing them are identical in most cases. When deciding how
to set up your campaign, the important thing to keep in mind is, exactly what
makes a great outdoor ad campaign? How many words should you use? What
colors work best to attract the attention of passing motorists? Should you
use graphics or just stick with hard-hitting copy? Ask a dozen experts, and
you may get a dozen different answers. It’s the beauty (and the bother) of the
business.
But in my opinion, you need to know two primary measuring factors for out-
door advertising:
 Impact: The ability to grab a viewer’s attention in a matter of seconds.
 Appeal: Persuasiveness and positive response by the viewer to the 
creative content.
Figure 11-2 shows a sign used inside a bus terminal. The ad was a success
because it immediately caught viewer attention with its simple message, bold
color, four-word header, and colorful product images. Viewers didn’t need to
engage in a lot of reading to get the message, learn the product name, and
know how the product would benefit them.
Eyeball-popping creative content, readability, simplicity and clarity of mes-
sage, and, of course, memorability (just like creative content of any advertis-
ing media) are the keys to a successful outdoor ad. The fact that an outdoor
ad, at least on a billboard, must be seen, read, and remembered while the
viewer is otherwise distracted with driving a car down a hostile freeway
makes simplicity and clarity of message the most important part of the equa-
tion. You only have a couple of seconds to grab the viewer by the eyeballs, so
your copy had better be brief and very fascinating. If you’re using a graphic
element, it too needs to be unique, relevant, and easy to understand.
Outdoor is one medium where simple visuals and word puns are appropriate
and highly effective. In your outdoor ads, strive for simple, readable, and cre-
ative ads, a welcome diversion to the monotony of travel.
I honestly believe that if you can encapsulate your message onto a really
good billboard advertisement; if you can project your message quickly and
with clarity; if you can generate some truly creative copy (a message that’s
brief, perhaps funny, and eye-catching), you’ve designed your entire ad 
166
Part II: Creating Great Ads for Every Medium 

campaign. If you can boil it down to six or eight perfect words, then you, my
friend, have made it so easy on consumers that you can hardly miss getting
their attention. The ad you’ve written to create a memorable billboard can
translate beautifully to any media. It is for this reason that your outdoor
advertising copywriting effort deserves serious time and attention.
The following sections cover how to make your outdoor ad readable, clear,
and memorable — which is all you need to get your message across to poten-
tial customers!
Pursuing potential customers
Before you can come up with an award-winning slogan, you must know who
your target audience is. Who is most likely to buy your product or use your
service? Of course, this is true of ads in any medium: Check out Chapter 5 for
a refresher course to make sure you’re targeting the right people for your
business — and that you can reach them via outdoor ads.

Chapter 11: Opting for Outdoor Ads

Making your ad readable
If customers can’t read your outdoor ad, then what’s the point? Your design
should be connected with a simple, clean text in a very readable type font.
Prioritize the keywords of your copy and keep your copy short and full of
punch. Use humor, but get to the punch line quickly. Vary the font size, avoid-
ing copy set in all capital letters. People are used to reading text in a combi-
nation of uppercase and lowercase, so outdoor ad copy should conform to
this format.
Six words is the most favorable number for billboard readability, but keeping
your message that short is often impossible. Try eight words if you must, but
any more than eight could be dangerous to the health of your ad budget.
If you’re using a graphic element — a picture, drawing, or logo — make it big
and keep it simple. Don’t force your viewers to search for the message. They
don’t bother. So make it clear immediately. How many billboards have you
seen that, like so many poorly designed newspaper ads, contain enough
information to fill an encyclopedia and the advertiser’s logo so small you
can’t read it with binoculars? The message is lost in a jumble of words, type
fonts, graphics, and a cacophony of background colors. Viewers drive right
on by with only a confused glance at the ill-conceived board. The ad is a total
failure. And the money is wasted.

Getting help with your outdoor ads
Getting started with outdoor advertising is
easier than you may think. For starters, check
out the Web site of the Outdoor Advertising
Association of America (OAAA), the trade orga-
nization for the industry and the epicenter of
reams of information about who, what, when,
and where. Find this complete informational
source at www.oaaa.org. Or call 202-833-
5566 to reach a live person at the OAAA who is
happy to answer your questions.
You can also call outdoor advertising compa-
nies that are operating in your area, accessible
through another great source: SRDS Media
Solutions’s Out-of-Home Advertising Source.
This book can not only steer you to the right out-
door company, but it also gives you a list of the
company’s rates. The book is available for sale
in hard copy or electronically at www.srds.
com (click on “Subscription and Product
Information”); you can also call to order the
book at 800-232-0772, ext. 8020 (or you may find
it at your local business library). You can do a
search of local companies in a number of ways:
by type, geography, or company name. These
companies can help you through the complete
process — from concept to creation, from print-
ing to posting, and even to tracking your results.

Be sure to use colors wisely. Strong color contrasts between the background
and the copy and graphics is absolutely essential. Use primary colors — yel-
lows, reds, blues, and good-old black. Use bright shades of colors rather than
darker tones, which retreat from the viewer. A bright yellow background and
black letters would be the optimum combination (hey, the publishers of 
this book knew what they were doing, didn’t they?). Using colors isn’t 
complicated — just shoot for the best possible readability from a long way
off, because that huge billboard looks like a postage stamp from a distance.
Keeping your ad clear
Viewers don’t want to be teased; they want to be informed. And with a bill-
board, they need to be informed in a split second, so don’t get too cute. Be
clear, concise, and direct. Relate your message to familiar experiences and
situations. Emphasize your product or service as the answer to the viewer’s
prayers. If you’re showing the product, make it big, bold, and brazen.
Also, make sure you limit the number of elements in your ad. A graphic, logo,
and headline only gets more complex — and therefore easier to ignore — if
you add elements such as the hours you’re open, your address, phone
number(s), and URL. Less is generally more, so add other information with
care and restraint.
Clarity is more important than cleverness. Don’t make the joke so subtle that
no one gets it — that only causes annoyance. And if you do use humor, be
sure it’s relevant to the experiences and knowledge of your target audience.
Don’t use East Coast humor on a California billboard. And try to create a tight
connection between your product’s benefit and its relevance to the viewer’s
life; create a problem and solve it in eight words or less.
Making it worth remembering
When your goal is to create a memorable ad for any media, imagery is often
more important than words. The use of a hard-hitting visual element can gen-
erate more memorability for the viewer. Use images that are easily recogniz-
able — like the beer mugs, anvils, and bloody teeth that comprised the signs
for saloons, blacksmiths, and dentists hundreds of years ago. Include light-
hearted, spirited elements that generate excitement, but try to ensure that
the viewer can relate to the person or situation being depicted. Possibly your
best solution is a bold display of your slogan, package, storefront, or logo.
169
Chapter 11: Opting for Outdoor Ads

The San Francisco Zoo did a series of billboards that was very memorable,
including one that featured a large photo of an anteater and, in black lettering
on a white background, the copy: “Eats 30,000 termites per day. Sorry, not
available for rent.” Now that’s creative!
Above all, make the message simple and easy to recall. Use bright, eye-catch-
ing color and brief, well-written copy. You only have a few seconds to make
an impact on someone who is already preoccupied driving a car.
For more tips on how to create memorable ads, check out Chapter 19.
Looking at a Success Story: Chick-fil-A’s
Billboard Campaign
Sometimes a product just cries out for a billboard campaign. It lends itself
beautifully to this advertising genre and, with a fairly heavy dose of creativity,
it can make all the difference. For example, Chick-fil-A’s signature product is
the chicken sandwich, served primarily during the lunchtime hours — which
means the restaurant chain competes in one of the fiercest battlegrounds: the
fast-food restaurant market. When compared to giants such as McDonald’s,
Burger King, and Wendy’s, Chick-fil-A is outnumbered in store count nearly
four to one and outspent in media tenfold. Moreover, each of these compet-
ing chains has already etched distinct images in the minds of consumers.
Faced with these David-versus-Goliath odds, Chick-fil-A gave its advertising
agency, The Richards Group, a tough assignment: Develop an integrated
advertising campaign that clearly positions Chick-fil-A as a preferred alterna-
tive in the burger-dominated fast food marketplace. In the following sections,
I outline how Chick-fil-A used outdoor advertising with great success.
170

When all else fails . . .
The sign companies with which you do busi-
ness have design and production departments
whose only goal in life is to make your outdoor
advertising successful. They know how to
design a board, how to write brief, hard-hitting
copy, and where to place your outdoor ads for
the optimal impact. The creative specialists in
outdoor, like the specialists in any media, under-
stand what works in their particular field.
You certainly have your own ideas of what you
want, and you likely have at least a copy outline.
But you may do well by letting the professionals
put the final touches on your creative strategy.
This design service is, by and large, available to
you at no extra charge. My advice? Take advan-
tage of it.

Aiming for the target audience
The Chick-fil-A target audience differs from the average fast-food clientele,
which includes many teens and children. The market for chicken is com-
prised of more adults, more females, and people with a higher level of educa-
tion and income than the hamburger market. Customers have a more active
lifestyle and are likely to be in white-collar jobs. Mindful of these demograph-
ics, Chick-fil-A avoided the usual fast-food locations to build their restau-
rants. Instead, they chose to operate in suburban malls and neighborhoods
with a high concentration of their potential customers.
Setting up the marketing strategy
In order to efficiently reach the adult, professional, and mobile target audi-
ence, the media strategy emphasized outdoor and radio. The budget was allo-
cated: 70 percent outdoor, 25 percent radio, and 5 percent print.
Capitalizing on the creative strategy
The Eat Mor Chikin campaign was launched. And it cleverly spotlighted a
little known fact: the poor spelling ability of your average cow! On billboards
everywhere, one three-dimensional cow statue stood on the back of another
cow statue and, with paint brush in hand (or hoof) and black paint dripping
down the stark white billboard background, the cow had scrawled the words
“EAT MOR CHIKIN.”
Reaping the results
During the Eat Mor Chikin campaign, same-store sales were up four times
over the industry average. It was a thoughtful and clever way to differentiate
the Chick-fil-A stores from their burger-dominated competition. Using cows to
deliver the self-serving message (I mean self-serving for the cows, who do, of
course, prefer you eat chicken rather than beef), Eat Mor Chikin was a bril-
liantly conceived and executed campaign.
It proves that clever copy and a great creative concept can cut through the
advertising clutter like a hot knife through butter . . . or is that chicken?

T

The advice I give here is done under the assumption that
you want to save a few dollars wherever possible. I also

understanding of the buzzwords you may encounter along
the way. And if you find you can’t do it yourself (or just

 Advertising your business on other companies’ Web sites and search engines
 Deciding whether e-mail advertising can work in your business’s favor
O
nline advertising is the newest ad medium, and even though it may
seem like it’s been around forever and you can’t remember a time when
you didn’t check the Web for something, it’s still fairly uncharted territory for
many businesses — not just small businesses but even the big guys. In fact,
an entire trade association, the Internet Advertising Bureau (www.iab.net),
is devoted to increasing companies’ knowledge and use of the Internet as a
viable advertising vehicle.
Online advertising is definitely something that every small business needs 
to consider doing, because of the ubiquity of the Internet. For many people,
especially younger people, searching the Web is the first place they go to find
information, learn about new products and services, and buy stuff.
To help you navigate your efforts on the Web, this chapter guides you
through how best to allocate this part of your advertising budget. If you’ve
decided you need a Web site but you don’t want to create it yourself, I guide
you to a professional to do it for you. And if you’re ready to go further and
advertise on other companies’ Web sites or start doing e-mail blitzes, I pro-
vide information on those options, too.

Hiring Someone to Create 
Your Business Web Site
If you’ve decided that you don’t want the responsibility or don’t have the skills
or time to design your own Web site (I discuss design in Chapter 6: “Creating
Your Own Web Site”), you should hire a Web designer to do this for you. In
other words, you can always pay someone else to do this for you when you
realize you can’t do it all on your own. To get started, check out the following
sites for lists of Web designers in your area who may be able to help you:
 AAADesignList.com: www.aaadesignlist.com
 The List: www.webdesign.thelist.com
You can also ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it can recommend a
Web designer (see “Finding an ISP to Run Your Site” later in the chapter). And
believe it or not, even though you’re developing something for the Internet,
you can even find “Web page and site design” in your Yellow Pages — which
is about as low-tech as you can get when searching for information!
Whether you’re a do-it-your-selfer or contracting for services, particularly
where Web advertising is concerned, it’s a good idea to research your intel-
lectual property rights, which will help ensure that they remain protected
and won’t be misused or abused by anyone else, particularly the copyrights
and trademarks associated with your ads and with your business in general.
Have a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights go over your busi-
ness and advertising plan with you if you aren’t sure what to look for.
Choosing a Web designer worthy 
of your hard-earned dollars
Wait, you say! Finding a Web designer is one thing, but how do I know
whether the developer is any good? Not all Web designers are created equal.
If you choose to hire a designer, you want her expertise, yes, but you also
want your own ideas steering the boat. Keep in mind, you’re paying this
person to translate your ideas into information that will be useful to your
customers on the Internet, so make sure you get what you pay for!
Here’s what you should expect from a good Web designer:
 Several sterling references. Be sure to call the references and ask how
well the designer worked with the customer. Did the designer meet
expectations? Was the schedule met? Were there unexpected costs at
the end?
176
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

 A trail of good Web sites. Examine the work of the designer by visiting
several Web sites developed by that person. Are the pages attractive?
Are the sites easy to navigate? Do the sites have a look and feel appro-
priate to the Web site? Do any sites take an inappropriate time to load?
 A clear list of what is and isn’t provided in the Web design project.
Will the designer put your site on the Internet for you? Will the designer
notify search engines that your site is available? Will the designer create
a logo for you, or do you have one already? How many pages will your
finished site contain? Will the graphics be custom-designed or taken
from a graphics package?
 The ability to optimize your site for search engines. Find a Web
designer who understands how to perfect your site so that customers
can find you.
 A delivery schedule. The designer needs deadlines in order to know
when you need the site up and running.
 Milestones. Will the designer give you a chance to approve or disap-
prove of the site at each step along the way?
 A clear estimate of the costs — all the costs.
 A professional product. The various pages on your site should all have
a unified look and feel. Graphics should be tasteful and not too large. No
single page should be so long that a visitor has to scroll way down to get
to important information.
Before you hire anyone, examine the work of the designer by visiting several
Web sites developed by that person. Consider the following factors:
 Are the pages attractive?
 Are the sites easy to navigate?
 Do the sites have a look and feel appropriate to the Web site?
 Do any sites take too long to load?
Your designer should expect professionalism from you, too. Here is what
your designer can expect from you. Be sure you’re providing the following:
 A clear sense of purpose. You should communicate the way you want
your site to look and feel. Flashy? Understated? Jam-packed with 
information?
 The content for your site. You can’t expect a Web designer to know your
business as well as you do. You must provide logos, information, or
whatever you’ve promised to the designer in a timely manner.
 A list of a few sites that you particularly like. The sites don’t have to be
in your same line of work, though.
177
Chapter 12: Investing in Internet Advertising

 A mind that’s made up. If you change your mind a little bit, that’s to be
expected. But no one can work with a person whose mind isn’t made up.
 Prompt payment. Enough said.
Contracting with and paying 
a Web designer
When you find a designer you like, you (or your lawyer, if you’re skittish
about doing this yourself) should draw up a contract so you both know what
work you’re paying for — and what you’re not going to pay for. This contract
can be as simple as a letter of agreement, but what’s important is that both
you and your Web designer sign it so that it’s binding.
You have several types of contracts from which to choose:
 Hourly: If you choose an hourly contract, make the reporting schedule
frequent so you know exactly how far along the designer is at any
moment. You don’t want to be caught by surprise. Be sure to reserve the
right to cancel the project if your expectations aren’t being met.
 Not to exceed: Under this type of contract, the developer estimates the
cost for you and probably charges by the hour, but the designer agrees
not to go over a certain cost. If the developer has misjudged the esti-
mate, he absorbs the cost.
 Fixed price: This contract is a flat rate. You and the designer agree to 
a single price for the entire job. Know exactly what you’ll receive on a
fixed-price contract. The number of hours your designer takes to com-
plete the project is of no concern to you. Whether the designer finishes
your site in a single day or a month, you pay the same rate.
 Cost plus: In this type of arrangement, the designer bills you for all
costs, plus you pay a fixed fee or a fixed percentage on top of the costs.
Some developers subcontract part of the work to other people, and you
are required to pay the fee.
 Design to fee: Under this kind of contract, you tell the designer how
much you’re willing to pay. In return, you receive the best Web page pos-
sible for that price.
These various financial arrangements are the same for any design job — Web
sites, print, collateral, whatever. You can mix and match or create other types
of agreements as you and the designer see fit. Most designers require a pay-
ment before the project begins. Keep that initial payment as low as possible.
178
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Make sure you include a payment schedule in your contract, no matter which
type of contract you use. If speed is important to you, add a schedule incen-
tive. For every week the project is late, deduct a percentage (about 5 per-
cent). If the project is delivered early, add a bonus to the fee. Never ever
make the final payment before the work is fully completed and you’re satis-
fied. Also include a cancellation clause in the contract. You want to be able to
cancel at your discretion at any time. (You have to pay for anything com-
pleted up to the point of cancellation, of course.) The developer wants a can-
cellation clause, too. That’s only fair.
Finding an ISP to Run Your Site
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are everywhere, and you have many options
to choose from. Here are some questions to ask of ISPs when you’re shopping
for one that works for you:
 Do you offer Web hosting? The World Wide Web (the Internet) is, of
course, a massive collection of Web sites, all hosted on computers
(called Web servers) all over the world. The Web server where your Web
site’s HTML files, graphics, and so on reside is known as the Web host.
Web hosting clients simply upload their Web sites to a shared (or dedi-
cated) Web server, which the ISP maintains to ensure a constant, fast
connection to the Internet. If your ISP doesn’t offer Web hosting, you
need to find another ISP.
 What kind of technical support do you offer? You want someone avail-
able to help you 24/7/365. Do they have a toll-free number? Is technical
help available via e-mail? Remember: Technical support never seems
that important when you’re signing up, but it becomes the most impor-
tant thing in the world when your Web site crashes.
 How many e-mail accounts can I have? You may need multiple e-mail
addresses if you have several employees. Take stock of what you think
you need — now and in the future.
 Do you have traffic limitations? Some ISPs have restrictions on the
number of visitors you may have to your site. Popular sites may be
zinged with unexpected costs. Find out what additional costs you can
incur if you go over the limit. The goal is to attract lots of people to your
Web site, so an ISP that charges you for doing precisely what you’re
striving to do may be one you want to avoid.
 How much disk space will my site be allowed? Tell the ISP whether you
think your site will have numerous pages or just a few. Be sure to men-
tion whether your site will have lots of graphics as well. This informa-
tion helps the ISP choose the correct package for you. Most hosting
packages offer at least 25MB of disk space, which should be plenty. That
amount works out to about 500 Web pages — give or take a few.
179
Chapter 12: Investing in Internet Advertising

 Do you keep backups? System crashes can kill your business. If the ISP
says its system never crashes, don’t believe it. What you want them to
say is that, on those rare occasions when their system crashes, they
keep backups on another machine. Along the same lines, ask whether
the ISP has a backup power supply onsite.
 Do you offer site statistics and log files? This information is helpful if
you want to keep track of how many visitors you have and which are the
most (and least) popular pages on your site. You can find out how long
each person stays on your site and where they came from — all very
handy information.
 Do you offer high-speed Internet access? Ask your ISP whether it sup-
ports digital subscriber lines (DSL), integrated services digital network
(ISDN), cable modem, and T1 and T3 connections. Does the connection
work at all times? Are there peak hours? Can you get a refund for 
downtime?
 How many users per modem does it have? You don’t want busy signals
all day. The more access numbers, the better.
 Do you have templates available to help me build my site? Some ISPs
offer simple boilerplates to fill out (called templates). You provide infor-
mation pertinent to your site, and the template creates the correct
HTML for you. (For more on templates, see Chapter 6.)
 Can you help me find a Web designer/developer? Many ISPs keep a list
of Web designers because they realize that most people don’t want to
bother with learning HTML. These Web designers can create a Web site
tailored to your individual requirements. Hiring a pro is a good way to go
unless you’re determined to master mounds of technical information. 
(If you want a go at designing your own site, consider checking out
Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 8th Edition, by Bud E. Smith and
Arthur Bebak [Wiley].)
 Will you buy and register a domain name for me? As ISPs discover
more about what their customers want, they offer more services. In days
gone by, you used to have to find an available domain name and then
buy and register it. For a small fee, ISPs can take care of this little
headache for you.
 Do you offer shopping carts? A shopping cart is what enables a buyer 
to select more than one item and pay for them all at the same time. If
you’re certain you never want to sell online, you can ignore this ques-
tion. But the answer could prove important if you think you may want 
an online store later.
 What e-commerce software do you have that can help me build an
online store? Does the ISP offer secure services for the customer? The
current standard is called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which protects
your customer’s private information, including his credit card number.
You don’t want to operate an online store without it.

Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Ranking Your Site: Purchasing 
Key Words on Search Engines
You can also advertise your business on various search engines. For example,
if you want to advertise on Google.com, check out “Get me on Google”
(www.getmeongoogle.com). This site does exactly that: It advertises your
business on Google, so that when people are searching for information on a
particular topic, if your business has anything to do with that subject, your
Web site appears on the right-hand side of the screen. “Get me on Google”
also analyzes your Web site and finds appropriate keywords that you should
match up to, and then it can run your ads for a monthly fee.
Buying Banner Ads on Other Web Sites
In addition to developing your own Web site (see Chapter 6), you may also
want to advertise on other business’s Web sites. Chapter 6 gives you the
basic information you need for how to create those ads; the following sec-
tions provide information on how to get those ads up and running. You can
get your banners and buttons on a Web site in several ways.
Using ad networks
A number of sites can place your banner ad for you. One of the leading sites
used by many big advertising agencies is DoubleClick.com (www.double
click.com). If you have a large company and a budget to match, DoubleClick.
com is a great option.
You can also check out other sites known as banner exchange networks. With
these sites, you have to display banner ads for other companies on your
company’s Web site, in exchange for them putting your banner ad on their
sites. The cost is lower and makes this option worth considering. Microsoft
has a useful exchange program. (Go to www.microsoft.com/small
business. Then click on “Attracting Customers,” in the Online Services 
section — attracting customers is what your advertising should do, right?)
You can also find a banner exchange program at www.bpath.com: Just click
on “Banner Exchange.”
If you click on Bpath.com’s “QuickBanner,” you can also create various types
of banners, for not a lot of money — for example, at the time of this writing,
check out these prices:
181
Chapter 12: Investing in Internet Advertising

 An animated flash banner maker costs only $19.95.
 An advanced (static) banner costs only $14.95.
 A GIF button costs $9.95.
 A GIF banner is free (heck — you can’t deny your attraction to that word!).
You can also search the Web for “ad networks” to come up with a huge list of
sites that can carry your ads for free.
Placing your online ads yourself
If your customer base is well-defined, you can find appropriate sites and
approach them yourself. A simple way to do this method is to search the
Internet by using a few keywords of interest to your customers. (You’re look-
ing for sites that share interests or content similar to your own.) You can get
a list of sites that may be appropriate for placing your ad. Check them out
and ask whether you can place your banner on their site for a fee or whether
you can simply exchange banners at no cost to either party (called a 
reciprocal link).
For example, suppose you sell baseball cards. Go to a search engine and type
in “baseball” or “sporting goods.” The list that comes up under either search
may have a site perfect for you. Don’t type in “baseball cards” as your search
term because the sites that appear there are your competitors. They won’t want
your banner on their sites, and you don’t want their banners on your site.
Although this approach can be effective, it takes time and an ability to negoti-
ate a fair price.
Online advertising via affiliate programs
You can also advertise your business via affiliate programs (also known as
partnership programs or associate programs). You contract to place ads on
your site, and you are paid when a visitor to your site clicks through or pur-
chases something from another site.
Affiliate programs are carefully targeted to the interests of your visitor. For
example, if you have a Web site dealing with antique furniture, you don’t want
to become an affiliate of a sporting good site, for example. Affliliate programs
are good for sites that are narrowly focused — and zillions of topic-specific
sites are out there. Amazon.com was the very first affiliate — it offers a per-
centage of the sale if one of your visitors buys from Amazon.com after click-
ing on its link from your site.
182
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

One drawback, if you’re considering becoming an affiliate, is that frequently a
visitor who clicks through to another site doesn’t return to yours. However,
you have a few ways to ensure that a visitor actually remains on your site
even though he has clicked on an ad. If you’re not an HTML expert, hire a
Web designer to help you accomplish this.
Find out more about affiliate programs by visiting www.associateprograms.
com or www.clickquick.com.
Finding out whether your 
banner is working
After you run your banner ads, find out how effective they are. You can do
this by using several kinds of statistics:
 Impressions: The number of times an ad appears on a Web page.
 Click-through: The number of times people select/click on your banner
or button.
 Click-through rate (CTR): The number of times the ad is clicked on
divided by the total number of times people see your ad.
183
Chapter 12: Investing in Internet Advertising
Pay schedules
Online ads have three major pricing structures:
 Cost per thousand (CPM): This cost of an ad
is for every 1,000 times the ad is displayed.
Most of the time, when you buy a CPM, your
banner appears on big, highly trafficked
Web sites. Sometimes this type of pricing
structure is called pay per face, but it’s the
same thing — the cost of 1,000 impressions.
(An impression is the number of times an ad
appears on a Web page.)
 Cost per click (CPC): You only pay for this if
someone clicks on your banner ad and is
taken to your site. Be a little careful before
plunging in to this type of ad. Your audience
is better targeted, but the cost is higher, and
you’d better be able to convert these visits
to sales if you want to make money. Sites
like www.valueclick.com buy unused
ad space on prime locations. Some compa-
nies don’t sell by CPC because the quality of
a banner is a determining factor in how
much they earn, and it’s a factor those sites
can’t control.
 Cost per transaction (CPT): You pay when
you make a sale. This choice offers great
accountability, but you do pay a significant
percentage for this type of fee structure.
This structure is also known as cost per
action (CPA).

 Conversion: The rate at which some goal is achieved (sales or orders or
traffic building, for example).
 Hit: Every component of a Web site viewed by a visitor. If you have one
Web page with 20 graphics and a visitor looks at all of them, you have 
21 hits.
In general, the conversion rate is the most important statistic. Number of hits
is largely meaningless, but I include it on this list because you probably hear
the term everywhere. Don’t be fooled. You’re interested in click-through rates
and conversion rates rather than just the number of impressions.
You can get these statistics in several different ways. If you join a program,
you can either buy banner placements (a fixed number of impressions) or you
can trade ad space on your page for ad space on someone else’s Web site.
When you join a program, you get access to individualized statistics that you
can view any time you want. You can find out how many times people have
seen your ad and also how many times people clicked over to your page. To
get the conversion rate, you have to work with your Web host (the supplier
of your e-commerce software).
You can also buy log-analysis software or even hire a company to track your
data and provide you with customized reports. You can find companies that
provide log analysis by typing the keyword “log analysis” in any Internet
search engine.
Assessing the Cost-Effectiveness 
of E-Mail Advertising
Today the return on investment is high for e-mail advertising. One reason is
that you have few upfront costs — an enormous advantage. You can, of
course, simply do it yourself, by writing a message to customers just as you
would to a friend, and then bcc’ing your customers’ e-mail addresses. The
only real “cost” of doing this is your time. This approach isn’t very sophisti-
cated; however, you may find it useful if your business is just starting out.
(For tips on how to create a successful e-mail advertising campaign, see
Chapter 6.)
If you think about the e-mail you receive from businesses, most of it has a
Web site link attached to it, where you can buy goods. For example, I get fre-
quent e-mails from Lands’ End, The Container Store, and J. Crew because I’ve
shopped there in the past, and they notify me when they’re having a sale or
when new merchandise is available. These huge companies clearly have an
e-mail advertising team to handle their campaigns.
184
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

You can also hire a company to handle your e-mail ad campaigns: Simply type
“e-mail advertising” into a search engine, and you can find companies that have
software to handle mass e-mail (and other direct-response mass-marketing
communication vehicles) and that provide their own servers that can handle
huge bandwidth. They can also provide you with reporting feedback on how
effective your campaign is: How many people have viewed your message, 
how many clicked-through from your message to your Web site, and how 
many people opted out of your advertising campaign. For example, www.
emarketingblitz.com is just one site that offers this service.
Keep in mind that your e-mail is competing with hundreds of other e-mails
jamming someone’s inbox. And people grow less tolerant as time goes by.
Most ISPs and other e-mail service providers have spam blocking programs,
to allow clients the choice of filtering their mail. Advertisers may eventually
have to pay for the chance to slip past the guards. That’s not necessarily a
bad thing. Sometimes paying a little more decreases the competition.
As Internet advertising continues to proliferate, marketing professionals
develop new ways to measure its effectiveness. One company (Marketing
Sherpa) conducted research in 2004 to find out how seasonality affected the
best day of the week to send e-mail. It evaluated the open and click rates
from more than 60 million e-mail messages sent by 7,000 marketers — and
found that the best day of the week is a moving target. (If you’re interested in
the details, check out www.marketingsherpa.com.)
E-mail advertising effectiveness varies among industries. An August 2006
study that Harte-Hanks, Inc., a direct-marketing company, conducted looked
at 4,300 business and consumer e-mail campaigns. Here are the best and
worst results:
 Restaurants had the best result, with a 167.7 percent open rate (an open
rate of more than 100 percent occurs when people pass along and/or
reopen the e-mail); restaurants also had the best click-through rate, of
57.5 percent.
 Retail had the lowest open rate, of only 35.3 percent.
 The automotive industry had the lowest click-through rate, of only 
5.7 percent.
In case you’re curious, here are the click-through results for all 13 industry
categories that Harte-Hanks, Inc. studied, from best to worst:
1. Restaurants: 57.5 percent
2. Publishing: 55.6 percent
3. Pharmaceuticals: 23.8 percent
4. Travel and hospitality: 23.4 percent
185
Chapter 12: Investing in Internet Advertising

5. Conference events: 14.2 percent
6. Financial services: 11 percent
7. Technology: 10.9 percent
8. Government: 9.5 percent
9. Insurance: 9.5 percent
10. Consumer packaged goods: 8.6 percent
11. Entertainment: 8.1 percent
12. Retail: 6 percent
13. Automotive: 5.7 percent
These results don’t mean that you shouldn’t consider doing e-mail marketing
for your business if it’s ranked lower on this list. But it helps to know which
industries have been most successful getting through to people.
Your best results come from past and prospective customers who’ve given
you their e-mail addresses, because they want information from you on an
ongoing basis.

 Knowing where to run your ads
 Maneuvering the minefield of print ad pricing

 Getting the best deal possible
P
rint advertising includes everything from daily and Sunday newspapers
to consumer magazines, business-to-business publications (including
trade journals, newsletters, and professional magazines), and even the Yellow
Pages or other directories. According to Advertising Age’s 2005 “Fact Pack,”
the advertising pie included the following print media slices for the 100 lead-
ing national advertisers’ spending in 2004:
 Newspapers: 17.4 percent (advertisers spent $46.6 billion)
 Yellow Pages: 5.3 percent (ad costs totaling $14 billion)
 Consumer magazines: 4.6 percent (a $12.25 billion price tag)
 Business publications: 1.5 percent (amounting to $4 billion)
By comparison, advertising on broadcast TV was 17.5 percent (comparable
with newspapers), and direct mail advertising was the largest piece of the
pie, with 19.8 percent. Keep in mind, though, that these leading national
advertisers are the big guns who are spending big budgets. (Must be nice!)
Still, these figures give you some idea of how companies allocate their adver-
tising dollars, so you can determine the print advertising needs of your own
business.
In this chapter, I show you how to select the right print publications for your
particular business and how to negotiate with those publications after you
have narrowed down the list. Pay close attention, because newspapers and
other print publications have more discount rates than the stars in the 
heavens — and you don’t want to pay one dime more than you have to.

Choosing the Right Publication 
for Your Print Ad
When you’re ready to get your print ad out there for the world to see, the
first thing you need to do is choose a venue. This task may seem like an easy
one, and sometimes it is. You can choose among major daily newspapers,
weekly papers, entertainment-oriented newspapers, trade publications 
(business-to-business publications), consumer magazines, mailing inserts,
and on and on. Your mission is to choose the media that your potential cus-
tomers are reading. How do you accomplish that?
Although you may be tempted to put your ads in the publications that you
read (after all, they’re the ones you know), your ads will be a bigger success
if you put them where your customers can see them. Talk to people in your
target audience — your customers. Ask your current customers the following
questions:
 Why they choose your store or business
 How they decide to buy your product or service
 What publications they read — both at work and at home
 Which section of the newspaper they turn to first
 Which media they’re likely to respond to when shopping around for
what you’re selling
With a little hip-pocket market research — where you ask a lot of relevant
questions of people who already know your store or business — you can pin
down the publications into which you should insert your ads.
Almost every consumer magazine and business publication offers a media kit
that provides information on the demographics of its subscribers — typically
in terms of gender, age, income level, and even marital status and the number
of children, depending on the publication. Some publications provide this
subscriber information online, but be careful when checking Web sites so
that you’re not just getting demographics for the online version of the publi-
cation, which may differ from the print version of the publication.
Media kits also give general guidelines to how much it costs to advertise in
the publication’s pages. Most kits have an annual schedule of theme topics
the publication plans to cover, which can help you develop your advertising
plans if your product or service is particularly tied to any of those topics. For
188
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

example, if your business is wrought-iron patio and lawn furniture and you
know that Better Homes and Gardens magazine is doing an article about
buying outdoor furniture in the next May magazine, you may want to adver-
tise in that month’s issue.
Calculating Your Print Ad’s Cost
I have good news and bad news about print media ad costs. The good news is
that most print media actually have easy-to-read (albeit somewhat difficult-
to-understand) rate cards that list the various costs for assorted ad sizes — a
welcome relief from the way radio advertising is negotiated, as I describe in
Chapter 14.
The bad news is that the rate card is nothing more than a starting point in
the media-negotiation and buying process, because newspapers, especially,
have created so many permutations of their basic (or open) rates that even a
professional media buyer has trouble deciphering them in order to come up
with the most frugal media buy. And after you discover the nuances of one
publication’s rates and myriad discounts, you can then call the next publica-
tion and start all over again — no two publications’ rates and discounts are
alike. (I think they do this just to totally confuse you and to give their sales-
people a reason for being.)
After deciding where you’re going to put your ad, you need the help of a sales
rep (see the section “Finding a Good Sales Rep” later in this chapter) to figure
out what the ad’s going to cost you. But before you go into a meeting with a
rep, you need to know a few things about how print ads are priced.
For example, somewhere in the mists of time, all newspapers made the dia-
bolical decision that no two advertising pricing schemes would ever be the
same. Newspapers and other publications generally price print ads by multi-
plying the number of columns wide, by the number of inches high, by a dollar
amount for each column inch. For example, a quarter-page ad in most news-
papers is 3 columns wide by 11 inches high, which makes it a 33-column-inch
ad. So if the open rate for your local paper is $50 per column inch, you have
an ad that can cost you $1,650 for one insertion.
Unfortunately, it’s not always that simple. Here are just a few of the seemingly
infinite variations possible to that simple pricing structure:
 The initial $50 per-column-inch rate can change for numerous reasons,
because it’s the open rate (the rate paid by a new advertiser who runs an
ad only one time).
189
Chapter 13: Buying Ad Space in Print Media

 If you’re willing to commit to running your ad multiple times over a cer-
tain time period, you can reduce the open rate by as much as 50 percent.
 Newspapers and other publications often give discounts for new busi-
nesses, minority-owned businesses, first-time advertisers, political
advertisers, nonprofit groups, and so on.
 If you’re willing to commit to three ads per week, and if you’re also will-
ing to make a substantial dollar commitment over an extended time
period, you can dramatically reduce your rate per ad.
 You may qualify for more than one of these discounts — for example, if
you’re willing to commit to a long-term buy and you’re also a nonprofit.
Usually, newspapers offer what they call pickup rates. A pickup rate is a dis-
counted rate newspapers give in return for running the same ad two or more
times in the same week. For instance, if your first ad runs in the Sunday
paper, your newspaper rep may quote you a pickup rate as follows: “Our
pickup rates are 20, 30, 40, then 50, 50, and 50.” That’s her way of saying that
if you run your ad a second time in the same week, you receive a 20-percent
discount; a third insertion in that week gets you a 30-percent discount; a
fourth insertion gets you a 40-percent discount; and for every time you run
the ad in that same week after that point, you receive a 50-percent discount.
And the discounts apply to all ads you run.
190
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
Cost per thousand
The cost of reaching the consumer via print is
often expressed in cost per thousand (CPM),
your cost if you want to reach 1,000 consumers
with your advertisement. For instance, coupon
booklets are usually target-mailed to groups of
10,000 households. To have your ad included in
a one-time mailing of a coupon booklet to a par-
ticular group of homes may cost you $275,
resulting in a CPM of $27.50 ($275 divided by 10).
In that same market, you may find that running
an ad in a daily newspaper may give you a much
different CPM. For example, running a print ad
that includes that same coupon may require a
3-column-by-2-inch ad (6 column inches). That
ad, priced at an open rate of $80 per column
inch, costs you $480. If the newspaper boasts a
circulation of about 300,000, your CPM is only
$1.60.
But hold on there! You have much to consider,
much to factor in. First, depending on which
section of the paper your ad runs in, count 
on about only 20 percent of the paper’s total cir-
culation actually seeing your ads. Second, a
small coupon ad positioned on a full page of
newsprint is dramatically different (read, dra-
matically less effective) than a color coupon
printed and mailed to consumers in a coupon
booklet.
What’s the moral of this story? CPM is an impor-
tant consideration when evaluating the cost of
print advertising. However, you need to con-
sider other factors if you want to compare
apples to apples. My suggestion is to always
factor in the variables, stir in some gut feel, and
do the math so you’re aware of the CPM. Then
use all these aspects to make more sense of a
sometimes-confusing media choice.

Clearly, the discounts definitely have a way of adding up! The ad in my exam-
ple earlier in this section, which I priced at $1,650 for a single insertion, ends
up costing $594 at the end of one week if you run it multiple times — which
gives you a discount of 64 percent!
Ad pricing is complicated, confusing, convoluted, and intimidating. The only
way you can be sure you’re getting the best rate possible is to tell your rep,
in no uncertain terms, “Give me all available rates.”
Finding a Good Sales Rep
If you’re buying print media, you deal, for better or worse, with sales reps
from the various publications — newspapers, magazines, Sunday supple-
ments, coupon books — into which you’re inserting your ads. Sales reps
come in many shapes, sizes, and abilities ranging from nearly comatose to
able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. So, unless you own a portable
defibrillator and can strap it on quickly, you want to look for a rep who is a
high achiever.
In some cases, you may not be able to choose a rep: Many national publica-
tions assign accounts to sales reps based on region of the country, so if your
business is in Detroit, you need to deal with a Michigan sales rep. Find this
info out early on. Call the publication directly, or many publications list this
information as well as the names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of
their ad sales reps under the “Contact Us” or “Advertising” sections of their
Web sites.
In the following sections, I describe a variety of ways you can find a good
sales rep who will help you run your print ad, hopefully in the best format
and at the best time.
Cold-calling a publication: Don’t do it!
When you’re interested in buying an ad with a particular print media, you
don’t have to take the sales rep that the receptionist transfers you to when
you call the front desk. In fact, I’ve always believed that the really good reps
are busy taking orders, or they’re out in the field generating new orders, or
they’re visiting their many clients and taking care of business. So who
answers your call? Yep, the rep who’s lazy, or a rookie without a clue, or the
guy who’s waiting around the office hoping the phone will ring.
191
Chapter 13: Buying Ad Space in Print Media

If you’re not locked in by region or some other factor, don’t give your adver-
tising account to just anyone. Do everything you can, regardless of the size of
your budget, to work with the best sales rep in the department. When you
want a job done right, as the saying goes, give it to a busy person. Picking the
right sales rep can mean the difference between a successful, mutually prof-
itable relationship with an advertising partner and a frustrating and possibly
expensive disaster.
Going straight to the top: 
Call the sales manager
To find the right rep, a great place to start is to call the publication’s sales
manager. Explain your needs and the kind of person you want to work with —
tell the sales manager that you have been disappointed by some other media
reps and want to work with the manager’s best, someone who’s sharp and
motivated (and hungry); someone who actually returns your phone calls on
the same day; someone who carries a cell phone; someone who’s available to
help you solve last-minute problems; someone who can be your advertising
partner; someone the sales manager is proud and confident to have you 
work with.
Although asking the sales manager for his or her best rep has no guarantees,
you’re much more likely to get someone who works hard for you than if you
just called and told the sales manager to send someone out to see you. The
person the sales manager assigns to you after you give her some parameters
(which implies that you’re no rookie to this media-buying game) is probably
given some very specific instructions about what your expectations are,
instead of being handed a yellow sticky note saying, “Call/follow up.”
Asking for referrals
Another method for finding a good sales rep is simply to ask for referrals. You
can save yourself a lot of wheel-spinning and grief by taking advantage of
insider knowledge. The two best sources for referrals are
 Competing publications’ sales reps: Even though they’re competing for
the same advertising dollars, sales reps tend to know each other, hang
out together, and belong to the same clubs. High achievers are going to
be friends with people similar to themselves. Birds of a feather, and all
that.
192
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

 Friendly business competitors: Your business competitors, at least
those with whom you’re on speaking terms, can be another great source
of insider information. Some of them are undoubtedly placing advertis-
ing with the same publications you’re looking to employ, and they can
steer you toward sales reps you can enjoy working with, as well as warn
you of sales reps you should avoid.
A simple way to find a sales rep worth your while is to call the publication
and ask for the rep who handles your competitor’s ads — or any ad you think
is well done and well placed.
Becoming a Formidable Ad Buyer
Buying ad space in the many print mediums requires patience and tact — and
a bit of conniving — if you want to get a good deal. In this section, I provide
some helpful hints on getting the most for your money when it comes to 
print ads.
Acting as though you’re reluctant
If you’re thinking about placing a print ad, you’ve probably decided to use 
a particular newspaper (for example), and you may already know that you
want to run a quarter-page ad every Saturday for the next six months. If you
walk into a meeting with a sales rep and tell him what you’re looking for, he
will probably pull out a rate card, listing all the standard rates for ads of vari-
ous sizes. But if you pay the rate-card cost for an ad, that’s essentially the
same as paying full sticker price for a car at your local dealership. And, if
you’re like me, you ain’t gonna do that!
Buying reluctantly is all about not revealing all your cards to your sales rep. 
So when you meet with the rep, convey something like the following:
I’ve been considering several different types of advertising, including
advertising in your newspaper. I have a great deal with the Yellow Pages, I
plan to buy some local radio, and I’m sending out a monthly coupon with
a direct-mail house as well. I just wanted to find out from you whether
your newspaper may be able to round out my media buy and comple-
ment what I already have in the works.
193
Chapter 13: Buying Ad Space in Print Media

This language sends out a strong message to the rep — a message that states
that you aren’t just a pushover and that the rep has some work to do in order
to get your business. The rep doesn’t need to give you a big, fat sales pitch.
You have shown, in your speech, that you know what you’re doing, that you
expect to be treated differently than other new advertisers, that you’re not
about to pay full sticker price, and that, bottom line, you want a deal. That’s
a powerful message!
Don’t just stop with good opening remarks. If you’re meeting in your office,
leave a few business cards from this rep’s competitors lying around your
desk along with pages torn from the Yellow Pages on which you’ve scribbled
notes with a red marker. Reps have a notorious talent for reading upside
down, so he will read anything you leave on your desk. Ask the newspaper
rep whether he thinks radio advertising is still a good value in your area.
Prearrange to receive a phone call in the middle of your meeting and say
things like, “No way! I’m not paying that rate. That’s ridiculous!”
You’ve now set the stage for the sales rep to come back to you with a con-
vincing pitch that his publication is not only the right media for you, but also
one of the most affordable. Now is the time to sit back and listen. Let the rep
go to work, and never give him the slightest hint as to which way you’re lean-
ing. And when he has quoted you the best rate he can personally offer, refuse
it and send him back to his sales manager for an even better one.
During my decades in the advertising business, I’ve worked with hundreds 
of clients, big and small, and I can tell you that owners of small businesses,
whose ad budgets are comprised of their own, hard-earned money, are instinc-
tively reluctant buyers. As a matter of fact, in my experience, the smaller the
account, the more client service is involved. These people correctly perceive
their ad budgets as real dollars subtracted off the bottom line (that’s their
take-home pay), and they want to know how every nickel is spent.
194
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
Emptying a sales rep’s bag of tricks
Like most people, you probably have had the
experience of someone trying to sell you some-
thing that you didn’t really want to buy. Whether
it was a time-share condominium in Mexico or
a new car at the dealer down the street, the
common (and happy) denominator of this excru-
ciating experience was that the longer you
resisted the initial offer, the better the deal got.
Believe me when I say that all media sales reps
carry with them a bag filled to the top with tricks
to be used to close deals when the need arises.
If you do your job, you eventually get a much
better deal than you were offered originally, and
in turn, you stretch your ad budget.

Unlike small business owners, employees of large companies, who are spend-
ing corporate advertising budgets, tend to view those dollars as an abstrac-
tion, are often lazy with their buying, and are, therefore, much easier to sell
and service. If you’re spending your own money for print ads, I probably
don’t need to tell you to be a reluctant and careful buyer, but I’m reminding
you to do so just in case.
Making your sales rep think 
she’s got competition
If you don’t create at least the appearance of a competitive situation, you
won’t receive the best price available. In other words, even if you’re not talk-
ing with other sales reps from other media or other publications, you need to
make your sales rep think you are. You need to introduce the possibility of
competition (and reality) into the lives of your sales reps. You can accomplish
this feat in countless ways, a few of which I outline in the following sections.
Asking for more perks
The mere mention of competition is usually enough to send your sales rep
running for her pencil sharpener. The simplest method is to study the rep’s
first offer and then, casually, but with confidence, simply ask for more. If she
offers you four ads for $1,000, tell her you need six ads for the same price —
or she’s forcing you to get quotes from other sources. You may not get
exactly what you ask for, but I guarantee that you’ll get something.
Wheeling and dealing
Call all the competitors, get quotes and bids, and then let them tear each
other apart. Show reps their competitor’s proposals and let the various reps
analyze their competitors’ bids. Then, sit back and watch the backstabbing
games begin. This contest is despicable, but it works to your own advantage.
It may get a little bloody, but I guarantee you can get the best rates and
combo deals available from each and every publication.
Making an arbitrary change
If you’ve been using a particular newspaper for an extended period of time,
make a surprise and very arbitrary change. Then when your sales rep drops
into your office to get your monthly order, tell her you’ve decided to place
your ads in another paper or switch your budget to radio this month because
her competitor has offered you a deal that you simply can’t refuse. Naturally,
your rep may be shocked and dismayed, and she may lay a huge guilt trip on
you by whining something like, “Gee, I thought we were working so well
together.” But don’t even bat an eyelash.
195
Chapter 13: Buying Ad Space in Print Media

The rep can then do one of two things: Go out to her BMW (all reps drive
very tired BMWs), drive to the nearest grocery store, fill up on comfort food,
and head home to spend the rest of her life watching daytime television and
eating ice cream. Or return to her cubicle where she has to tell her sales man-
ager that she lost your business this month. Her manager will then instruct
her to go back to your office and do whatever it takes (offer lower rates, more
insertions, better page position, whatever) to win back your business. What
you hope is that your sales rep chooses the second option — not only does
she go on to lead a long and happy life (with a lot less calories), but you get a
good deal on the next month’s ads at the same time.
Complaining when the time is right
If one of your customers bought a brand new whatchamacallit from you at a
premium price, then took it home, used it once, and it broke, I guarantee that
you would quickly see that customer back in your store, whatchamacallit in
hand, ranting and raving for either an exchange or a refund. Or if you yourself
order something from a catalog that turns out to be less than advertised, you
get onto the customer service line in a heartbeat and complain loud and
clear until you are either sent another item or given assurances of a full and
immediate credit to your account. Complaining is sometimes the only way to
get what you want (more so everyday, it seems), and you should use this
tried-and-true technique to ensure that your print budget is always maxi-
mized. Newspapers and other print media don’t go out of their way to make
mistakes; it’s simply a fact of life.
If anything is wrong with the placement of your print ad, don’t be shy. Get on
the phone and chew out anyone who listens to you. Start with your rep and
move right up the chain of command until you find satisfaction. If your ad
falls on a page that was printed a bit light because the roller was running out
of ink, complain. If the newspaper buries your ad in some obscure section
that you didn’t contract for and would never select if given a choice, com-
plain. If your ad was scheduled to run on Friday but didn’t run until Saturday,
complain. If the publication sandwiches your ad between two of your com-
petitor’s ads, complain.
Most publications have a fairly liberal policy when it comes to giving their
customers make-good ads (ads that try to make good on the publication’s
promise to you). Instead of making a good customer angry about some fairly
common mistake, the publication usually gives you another free ad to make
up for anything you’re unhappy about.
196
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

If you don’t complain, whatever it is you didn’t complain about is bound to
happen again. In any publication, you can unearth good, great, and just plain
lousy ad placements (or positions). However, most newspapers place ads in a
section and on the page in a random and somewhat arbitrary fashion. The
people who do the actual layout of the finished paper start with a stack of
ads and a pile of pictures and stories and assemble the newspaper. Your well-
timed complaint can cause your rep to hand-carry your ad back to that
department and ask the nice folks for a favor. To further my point, if you and
your competitor both get lousy ad placements and the other guys complain
but you don’t, then your competition gets the make-good ad, your competi-
tion gets better placement next time, and, because of all this, your competi-
tion has an advantage over you.
You can significantly stretch your print advertising budget by not pretending
you have lockjaw every time a publication screws things up. Loud and vocif-
erous complaints get you two things — make-good ads and better ad place-
ment. The value of free make-good ads is fairly easy to determine, and a
well-placed ad can be worth twice that of a poorly placed ad. In short, your
ad does a heck of a lot better if it’s positioned where someone can actually
see it!
Most newspapers do, sadly, give you a legitimate reason to complain at least
once every ten ads you run. Newspapers especially have a talent for getting it
wrong, perhaps because of the sheer volume of ads they run each day. It is
logical, therefore, that you can stretch your ad budget by 10 percent simply
by not being shy. So stick up for yourself, and get the placement you deserve
that will advertise your business well!

 Capitalizing on seasonal incentives
R
adio stations target their programming to attract very specific audi-
ences. You can find stations formatted for everyone from teenyboppers
to Baby Boomers, from cowboys to classical music aficionados. Some sta-
tions feature hits of the ’50s, ’60s, or ’70s; stations that broadcast only news;
Spanish language, country, jazz, or good old rock ‘n’ roll stations. Radio has
something for everyone.
However, radio advertising comprises only a small piece of the advertising
pie — at least for those “leading national advertisers” I mention in Chapter 13.
According to Advertising Age, radio ads made up only 7.4 percent of total
media expenditures in 2004 — compared to 19.8 percent direct mail ads, 
17.7 percent newspaper ads, and 17.5 percent commercials on broadcast TV
(which together makes up more than half of all media placements). Remember
that these percentages are for big companies like Procter & Gamble, General
Motors, Dell Computer Corporation, Time Warner, and other giants; on the
other hand, you may find that radio advertising works great for your business.
Radio audiences tend to be very loyal to their favorite stations, sticking with
their favorites not only out of choice, but also out of habit. They’re also loyal
to many of the advertisers on their favorite stations, so finding the stations
that can deliver the best audience for your commercial messages is definitely
worth the effort.

In this chapter, I help you figure out which stations to advertise on, guiding
you through the terminology you may hear from the people selling you the
ads. I also let you know how to read a broadcast media invoice to figure out
whether you’re really getting the ads you paid for. And I let you know how
you can stretch your advertising budget — and get something for yourself at
the same time. (In Chapter 8, I provide information and suggestions on how
to create memorable radio ads for your business.)
Determining the Best Radio Station 
for Your Ads
Before you get down to the nitty-gritty of negotiating and buying a schedule
for your radio ads, you need to do a little homework to ensure that your
schedule runs on the station best suited to attract customers to your busi-
ness, customers who want to buy what you’re selling. For instance, if you’re
selling pickup trucks, you’re probably better off advertising on a country
music station than on one that plays only classical. If, on the other hand, you
own an art gallery or jewelry store, the classical station may be just the place
for your ad bucks.
You probably have your favorite radio stations — ones you’ve programmed
into your home and car radios. And you probably know of other radio sta-
tions that you specifically avoid, because what they play just isn’t what you
like. If you use these personal likes and dislikes as a starting point, you’re
well on your way to selecting the stations that are right for your advertising
dollars. Without even knowing it, you’ve already done much of your research.
Knowing what you like and don’t like helps you find the station that’s right
for your ads because you’re aware that each station appeals to a certain audi-
ence. But the stations you listen to may not be the ones that your customers
listen to. So don’t limit your advertising to just the stations you like. If you do,
you can miss out on a huge section of your target market.
In the following sections, I show you how to start researching which stations
may be best for your business and what demographic group(s) you’re really
targeting, and then I go into more detail about how to research radio stations.
In addition to all this info, I describe how to buy time for your ads on the
radio stations you’ve chosen.
200
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Specifying which demographic you’re after
Who are your customers? Men between 18 and 35? Women between 35 and
54? Teenagers? Whatever demo you’re after, you can most likely find a radio
station in your market programmed specifically to reach that narrow audi-
ence segment.
Radio stations break down the various demographics into seven different age
groups for both sexes, as you can see in Table 14-1. Ask the stations you’re
interviewing to show you a demographic profile of its listeners; this profile
gives you a clear picture of whether a particular station is a good fit for your
business.
Table 14-1
Demographic Groups

When presenting this information to you, most stations use ratings for a cate-
gory called Total Adults, 25–54. This group is an extrapolation of the totals for
three separate age groups of both sexes.
The problem with focusing on your demographic is this: The station that’s
programmed to appeal to your prime demo may not enjoy the best ratings in
the market and, therefore, may not be your best buy. On the other hand, that
station may be your best buy because of the fact that it’s delivering your tar-
geted demographic, in spite of its low ratings. Confused? No wonder: The
challenge is calculating the cost per targeted listener, which is typically
expressed in terms of cost per gross rating point, or GRPs. GRPs, of course,
vary from market to market, because the size of the market enters into the
calculation. To find out how to compare station ratings, check out the section
“Evaluating station ratings.” (You may also want to read the sidebar “When
you don’t need to buy the very best” for additional info.)
201
Chapter 14: Purchasing Ad Time on the Radio

Doing your homework
Before you commit to advertising on one station, check out your options. You
may be surprised to find out how many valuable resources are out there to
help you make your decision. In this section, I give you a few valuable tools
to research before you settle down with a station.
Don’t panic! If you find this discussion of analyzing data too overwhelming,
take a deep breath. Maybe it’s time to hire someone to help you, so check 
out Chapter 16 for details on exactly that: Bringing in the professionals. Full-
service ad agencies and media-buying houses are available, and they have
analytical tools, ratings databases, and optimization software — along with
the knowledge and prowess to negotiate the best deals for your business.
Utilizing the Internet
If you’re interested in checking out all your options, researching various sta-
tions is easier than ever due to the Internet. For example, simply type “radio
stations” into an Internet search engine like Google, and you can find Web
sites that provide you station information, sites like www.radio-locator.
com. This specific Web site allows you to indicate what region you’re looking
for — and then provides, for example, 74 radio stations in New York City (if
that is the region you requested). This list gives the call letters of each sta-
tion (like WBGO), the frequency (such as 88.9 FM), and a very brief format
identifier (jazz, adult contemporary, hip-hop, talk, Spanish, religious, busi-
ness news, top 40, and so on). Then you can simply click on the call letters
and go directly to the Web site of the station that interests you, to find out
more about its programming and determine whether it matches the target
market of your ideal customer.
Evaluating station ratings
Picking the right stations is a complicated process, and, more often than not,
you ultimately need to take a giant leap of faith when finally placing your buy.
But a good place to start is with the most current ratings of all stations —
information you can get from any and all the sales people who call on you. If,
on the other hand, you’re located in a small market with but a couple of sta-
tions, you don’t need to sweat this stuff.
Getting ratings data from radio stations is very tricky. Data is very selectively
presented and can be misleading (such as rankers, which I define in a later
section). Often, a station shows you its ratings based on total persons 12 and
older. You’re most likely to find this information in a sales piece in the media
kit. Be aware of what you’re looking at as you sift through this information.
You don’t want to base your media buy on such a broad audience composi-
tion; you want to see the various age groups separated into the demographic
categories (see Table 14-1) so you can be assured that your prime demo is
202
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

well represented in a station’s listenership. And, besides, how much spending
power do 12-year-olds really have? (In truth, a lot more than their parents
would care to admit, but still not as much as adults.)
The most current station ratings are published every quarter in what is
known in the ad biz simply as a book. Companies like Arbitron, which is the
largest and most-recognized ratings service, do the research and publish the
books. Smaller markets have their own ratings services, which are less
expensive and therefore more attractive to small market stations. The ratings
services use different methods to rate the stations, including radio listening
diaries, which are maintained by individual listeners, and random telephone
calls within the survey area. Personally, I don’t think the research is always
accurate. (How can the listening habits of a few hundred accurately represent
the listening habits of millions?) But it’s all we have, and so we live with it.
Just don’t accept one ratings book as the gospel, because it isn’t.
My agency’s media director doesn’t usually buy any station based on a single
rating book, regardless of how well the station ranks overall. She tries to use
a four-book average as a starting point, but with all the day-to-day changes in
most markets, you often have to look at the most-current information.
Otherwise, you’re looking at irrelevant data. Getting a four-book average isn’t
always possible, because small markets may only have two books per year
(and some only have one).
If you can get a four-book average (described in previous paragraph), you
can see how a particular station has fared throughout an entire year (and
believe me, station ratings can change dramatically from book to book, from
month to month). And here’s the best part: When you ask the sales rep for
this information, you can totally intimidate him with your insider knowledge.
Most station clients don’t know these books exist.
203
Chapter 14: Purchasing Ad Time on the Radio
When you don’t need to buy the very best
Just to confuse you (and to contradict myself),
I can tell you now that it’s not always necessary
to buy the top-rated stations. Why? Because the
top-rated stations are so darned expensive that
you can blow your whole budget without
coming close to achieving your frequency
goals. And the leading stations may not deliver
the prime demo you’re after anyway.
For example, the top-rated station may cost
$1,000 a spot for the morning drive (and in some
markets, it’s a lot more than that). But the
second- and third-place stations may each cost
half or even a third of that price. So, you can buy
the silver and bronze winners of the ratings
Olympics and get twice to three times the
number of spots and listeners. You achieve fre-
quency, and you’re not forced into bankruptcy.
It’s a beautiful thing.

Gathering information from your customers
One of your best sources to help you determine which radio station to
choose is your current customers. These people already believe in your busi-
ness, and you want to draw in more patrons like them. So find out what your
customers are listening to.
Many car dealers use a very clever — and simple — method of market
research to determine which radio stations to advertise on: They check the
preset stations on the radios in the cars brought in for service. This tactic 
is a very shrewd way for them to find out the listening habits of their 
customers.
But you don’t have to be in the car business to find out the radio habits of
your customers. Do an informal survey. Ask your customers this question
(and word it just this way): “What is your favorite radio station?” The answer
to that question is the one you want to take to the bank. After you’ve surveyed
a few dozen people, a pattern begins to emerge, and you can have a good idea
about which stations to consider for your advertising. If a station is appealing
to your existing customers, it’s likely a good bet to attract new ones.
Buying the station
Narrow your list of possibilities to three or four stations, call each one, 
and ask to speak with someone in the sales department, preferably the Sales
Manager (refer to Chapter 13 for why it’s a good idea to start with the head of
the sales department). Tell each salesperson that you’re considering placing
an advertising schedule on his station, and set some appointments. Yes, it’s
unavoidable: You need to invest some time and listen to sales pitches from
several stations, but it’s time well spent. The stations you call assign the
sales call to one of its sales reps, probably a new hire who is trying to build
an account list (the station’s top people are too busy servicing their existing
accounts).
Ask a lot of questions of the reps you meet with, both about the strengths of
their station and about their competition. Clarify who their target audience
is, and decide whether it meshes with your target (see the section “Specifying
which demographic you’re after” for more information). Talk about how you
define the success of your campaign and what your expectations are. At the
end of the day, one of the stations will stand out in your mind because that
station’s sales representative did the best job of finding your comfort level.
Buy the stations (that’s ad speak for “buy an ad on the stations”) that have
convinced you they can deliver your prime demo, tell them you’ll be watch-
ing the results very carefully, and then put your commercials on the air.
204
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

If you make a mistake — if the stations you choose don’t do the job you
expected — chalk it up to experience and take solace in the fact that soon,
very soon, you will be contacted by every other station in your market. Yes,
as sure as death and taxes, after you’ve placed an ad on one station, you will
be contacted by all the others. Station reps spend most of their time listening
to competing stations in order to hear which advertisers are buying which
stations. If they hear a commercial for your business, and you’re not already
buying their station (ad time), you will be contacted.
Talking the Talk of Radio Advertising
Before you march out into the world of radio advertising, you need to arm
yourself with the talk of the trade. These sections deal with some of the
common terms you may hear bandied about by radio reps (which some may
use just to confuse you, while also attempting to convince you that their sta-
tion is the perfect match for your business).
205
Chapter 14: Purchasing Ad Time on the Radio
Putting station events to work for you
Radio stations love to throw parties. Its person-
nel create special events at the drop of a hat.
Most of the larger stations even employ a
Promotions Director, who you may find to be a
vivacious, enthusiastic person who could just
as easily become a Cruise Director. They do
promotions, like a remote broadcast at your
store or place of business, in which the station’s
on-air personalities broadcast from your lobby
or parking lot inviting listeners to “Hurry to XYZ
Company and get your free station T-shirt and
bumper sticker.” These special events can be a
great traffic builder, occasionally attracting real
customers in addition to the ones just wanting
the free stuff.
Ask your station rep what kind of promotions the
station can put together to benefit your busi-
ness. If you’re spending a fairly sizeable budget,
you can probably get this type of promotion for
free.
Radio stations also participate in community
events such as street fairs, outdoor concerts,
and college campus events. The stations’ crews
set up their booths or park their electronics-
packed vans and then broadcast and hand out
free stuff. Many times they sell sponsorships of
these events, as in, “The big downtown chili
cook-off is sponsored by [Your Business Name
Here]. Come down and meet the nice folks and
pick up your free t-shirt, coffee mug, and key
chain.” If you can benefit from one of these
sponsorships, and if the event is relevant to your
business somehow, then go for it. These events
are usually priced quite reasonably and include
multiple on-air mentions (in the form of 10- or 15-
second announcements, or minicommercials),
which enhance your advertising schedule.

Cume
Cumulative audience (or cume for short) is the total net unduplicated audi-
ence accumulated over a specific period of time, as in the total audience of a
station during morning drive time. You don’t really need to know how many
people are listening to a station, but you do need to know how many people
in your target demographic are listening.
For instance, suppose you want to reach men 25 to 34. If a particular station
has a cume of 250,000, but most listeners are women and only a very few are
within your target demo, then this 250,000 figure doesn’t help you.
Be wary of station reps who proudly sell cume. In many cases, cume doesn’t
mean anything — it’s too broad a measurement.
While cume is often unhelpful by itself, stations can certainly give advertisers
cume by demo, which is the total unduplicated audience, measured within a
certain timeframe, of members of a particular age group of either men or
women or both — a much more relevant measurement.
For instance, a station can give you its cume for men 25 to 34, if that is the
primary demographic group you’re after. The cume measurement can be
compared with newspaper circulation: It’s comparable to the number of
people who receive the paper, but it doesn’t tell you how long they spend
reading it.
Cume is a valuable measurement; it just doesn’t tell the whole story. Because
this is radio and you’re going for frequency (the number of times an audience
member hears your commercial), you need to know the amount of time
people spend listening to a station (time spent listening is shortened to TSL).
A station with really long TSL and a smaller cume (that is, fewer people tuned
in but who stay with the station for a long period of time) is likely to have
better average quarter hour (AQH) ratings than a station with a large cume
and a small TSL (such as an all-news format where many people tune in but
get only the news, weather, or traffic report they’re after and quickly switch
stations).
Ranker
A ranker is a computer-generated report showing a selected demographic
audience of each radio station in a given market, ranked from highest to
lowest (for example, how many women 18 to 35 listen to each station in a
market). A ranker can be based on cume ratings, AQH ratings, share, or 
whatever.
206
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

By using qualitative data to create a ranker, nearly every station in a market
can show you that it’s number one — each station simply manipulates the
data to highlight its own strengths, as in “We’re number one with women 35
and older who have purchased perfume within the past year.” Of course, if
you’re actually looking for women over 35 who have purchased perfume
recently, buy that station in a heartbeat!
Beware of rankers, because each station puts its best foot forward and brings
you a ranker based on parameters that make it look its best.
Dayparts
Radio stations sell advertising time in various chunks referred to as dayparts.
Naturally, morning drive time (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.) costs a lot more than
midnight to 6:00 a.m. because you’re reaching more people during the former.
When you buy a schedule, you can either pick only prime time or make the
more frugal choice and buy a schedule that includes spots in various day-
parts, plus rotators, which are spots run in the best times available through-
out the 12- to 24-hour period. A rotator may run at midnight, but sometimes
you get lucky, and it runs in the middle of the day, or possibly in drive time. It
all adds to your frequency, so regardless of what times your ads run, you can
reach some listeners.
Reading the Fine Print
When you’ve made your decision to buy a radio schedule to advertise your
business, the station sales rep presents you with a proposal and a contract
for your signature. The proposal comes after the initial meeting, but before
you agree to the buy.
Study the proposal carefully, but stop right there! Don’t sign anything until
you sit down with the rep and try to grind out a better deal. In the following
sections, I show you how to evaluate and negotiate your contract as well as
how to hold the radio stations accountable to it.
Hammering out the details
Radio can be made much more affordable if you just do a little horse-trading.
Don’t be afraid to ask for some free stuff. The rep expects it and likely has
something in his pocket (something that the sales manager has preapproved
just in case you ask) that sweetens the pot.
207
Chapter 14: Purchasing Ad Time on the Radio

My agency buys millions of dollars’ worth of radio time every year, and I
don’t think we’ve ever bought a schedule “as is.” Instead, here’s our
approach:
 We negotiate by first asking the station for additional spots at no addi-
tional cost.
 If that doesn’t fly, we ask for better spot positions in more desirable day-
parts (we prefer that our spots run in the morning drive daypart than
from midnight to 6:00 a.m.).
 If we’re turned down on that request, we ask for free billboards (10- or
15-second announcements that are like minicommercials).
Our media buyer is continually looking for something extra from the 
stations — and you can benefit from doing the same. Getting extras from a
station is often easier if you’re willing to sign a long-term advertising con-
tract, such as an annual one.
The contract is delivered or sent to you after both you and the station man-
agement have agreed upon the terms (and free stuff) that have been ham-
mered out between you and the sales rep in the proposal. The contract
describes the following information:
 The number of spots you get
 The dayparts in which your spots run
 Your total cost to run these spots
The contract is broken down to show the cost of each commercial message
you’re buying. Some dayparts are cheaper than others, so the spots may
have different costs.
If you want to know how much a newspaper ad may cost you, the newspaper
sales rep can show you a rate card, a printed sheet on which you can see 
the precise costs of each and every column inch (although newspapers also
offer so many discounts that the rate card is simply a starting point — see
Chapter 13 for more info). But when you’re trying to find out how much a
radio schedule may cost you, the sales rep doesn’t show you a rate card
because, on most stations, no such thing exists — buying radio time is always
negotiable. And for that reason, when buying radio time, you shouldn’t accept
the first proposal as presented to you; you should always shoot for some-
thing better, for something extra. Nine times out of ten, the station adds
something in order to get your name on the dotted line.
208
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Holding ’em to it
Your contract promises that you can have a certain number of spots — some
in morning drive, some in midday, some rotating in the best times available
throughout the day, and some from midnight to 6:00 a.m., for example. When
you receive your invoice from the station, do what is known as post analysis:
Check the times your spots ran (all of which are listed on the invoice) and
compare the actual run times to the promised run times. If you find any dis-
crepancies, the radio station owes you make goods, which are free spots
given to you in order to fulfill all contractual promises.
Many advertisers don’t go to the trouble of doing post analysis. I do, how-
ever, and I continually find errors and always obtain make goods on behalf 
of my clients. Honest mistakes are made. Even though I’m sure the stations
don’t do anything to cheat you, you should still examine the invoices care-
fully and hold the station responsible for any errors and omissions.
Reading a station invoice can be a challenge — they’re sometimes quite con-
fusing. But do go over them carefully to assure yourself that you got what you
paid for. The invoice you get from the station is divided into columns. All the
spots in your schedule are broken down into the following categories:
 Day of the week (for example, Monday)
 Date (November 6)
 Length (60 seconds)
 Actual time/title of ad (6:56 a.m., Inventory Closeout)
 Rate ($450)
If a supplier on a co-op advertising program is paying for your spots, you also
want to check your invoices very carefully to ensure that the stations have
supplied you with all the requirements for co-op reimbursement. You won’t
get paid your co-op funds if you don’t send all the paperwork! You have pro-
vided the stations with copies of your radio script(s), and now you want to
make sure the stations have notarized your scripts and certified your invoice
as proof of performance. (For more on co-op guidelines, see Chapter 3.)
Many of my agency’s clients are co-op based. So around the tenth of each
month, when the broadcast invoices begin to arrive in the mail, frustration
and disappointment arrive with them. Even though we’ve been dealing with
multiple radio stations for years on behalf of these co-op based clients, and
even though the stations know that our accounts require notarized, certified
209
Chapter 14: Purchasing Ad Time on the Radio

scripts and invoices, they still occasionally send us incomplete invoices.
Inevitably, we receive invoices from some stations that don’t include nota-
rized scripts. I then have to call the offending stations to get the problem
resolved, cajoling them in order to get the corrected paperwork. Be diligent
in studying your invoices from broadcast media.
Waiting Patiently for the Results
People are bombarded by radio advertisements on a daily basis. Customers
need time to let your ad sink, which requires a good amount of patience on
your part. In the following sections, I offer some guidelines for how much
time you should give your targeted audience to truly “hear” your ad message
and when you should review your ads to see whether they need a-changin’.
Giving your audience time to respond
Radio is a frequency medium, which means that every listener must hear your
commercial message at least four times before remembering it. The newest
research shows that due to the increasing amount of advertising clutter,
advertisers in most markets need to shoot for what’s referred to as a four 
210
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
Don’t get bored with your commercial
Because you’re probably going to buy a 13-
week radio schedule, you may be tempted to
ask the station for run times, wherein the station
calls or faxes you every day with a list of the
actual times it scheduled your spots to run
(within a few minutes). Most new advertisers
ask for run times because hearing their com-
mercials on the air is kind of fun. But if you tune
in several times a day to hear your own spot,
you can soon get very bored with it. Keep in
mind, however, that the other listeners, the
people who may actually become your cus-
tomers, are not getting bored with your spot,
because they’re not hearing it every single time
it runs.
So don’t get all twitchy about changing copy
every week. You can run the same copy for the
full 13 weeks without boring anyone except
yourself. Besides, the average listener won’t
actually “hear” your spot until she’s listened to
it at least four times (that’s why you need to buy
frequency).
Of course, a 13-week schedule is also a good
opportunity to rotate two or three different com-
mercial messages, broadening your sales pitch.
So, if you have the time and the inclination,
knock yourself out and write several spots.

frequency. Yes, regardless of how creative you’ve been and how brilliantly
you’ve written your message, your commercial may have no effect whatso-
ever until the average listener has heard it four times.
When any given listener hears your spot at least four times, your message
slowly begins to sink in. If what you’re selling is appealing to that listener, she
may then respond to it and become one of your customers. The station can
show you how many spots you need to buy and how much money you need
to spend, in order to achieve a four frequency. The more your audience hears
your message, the more you entice them to become your customers. Don’t
freak out if they aren’t knocking down your door within the first hours of
airing your ad. Give ’em time!
Buying radio time: Too little, too much?
On radio, you’re better off buying a minimum 13-week schedule to accom-
plish the frequency you need and to ensure that your commercial message
reaches enough listeners to make your cash outlay worth your while. That’s
three months to make an impact. You don’t absolutely have to buy a 13-week
schedule, of course. You can step up to the plate with a heavy one-month
budget and still accomplish the desired frequency. But, if you can afford it, 
I recommend the tried-and-true 13 weeks.
Hearing your commercials over a longer period of time ultimately gives you a
presence with the listeners. Your name and message begin to sink in, which is
precisely why you’re advertising in the first place.
Evaluating your radio ads 
from time to time
No matter how many weeks of radio advertising you can afford, you need 
to give your ads time to work. But, a point in time comes when you need to
step back and evaluate the effectiveness of your ad schedule. One way to tell
whether they’re working or not is whether you have more business. And as
I mention earlier in the chapter, it’s always a good idea to simply ask your
clients or customers how they found out about you. Another option you may
want to try is committing to, say, two weeks per month on a station, and then
evaluating your results after three months.
If your store is still empty or your phone hasn’t rung in a while, it’s definitely
time to revamp your ad campaign or the media you’re using (or both!).
211
Chapter 14: Purchasing Ad Time on the Radio

Remember: Consistency is the key. You can run ads one week a month, if
that’s what you can afford — as long as you stick with it.
In addition to frequency, you want to analyze your ad’s effectiveness in terms
of reach, the number of people who are exposed to your messages over the
course of your radio schedule. Reach, when revealed to you by a station, is
usually shown as a percentage, not a number. For example, if your schedule
shows a reach of 5 percent men between 25 and 34 years of age, then that
value is the percentage of all the men ages 25 to 34 within your market whom
you are reaching with your schedule.
Taking Advantage of Seasonal 
Incentives to Reduce Your Costs
From October through December of each year, radio stations enjoy multi-
millions of dollars in additional revenue from political, automotive, and retail
holiday season advertising. Between politicians attempting to get elected, car
dealers trying to clear inventory, and every retail store in the known universe
hoping to get a piece of the holiday shopping pie, broadcast sales reps can
just sit in their cubicles and answer the phone. As a matter of fact, most sta-
tions become so saturated with advertising that they’re literally sold out —
meaning you can’t get a new commercial on the air even if you want to. This
feeding frenzy also results in sky-high advertising rates for the final quarter of
each year.
212
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
Convincing customers within the 72-hour window
Why do you suppose so many car dealer ads
are on the radio (or any other advertising
medium, for that matter)? It’s because car deal-
ers understand and endorse the concept of fre-
quency, because of what they call the 72-hour
window. What is a 72-hour window? Car deal-
ers know that when a person, any person, finally
decides to buy a new car, he buys that new car
within 72 hours of making the decision to do so.
Remember how hard it was as a child (or maybe
still) to wait for your birthday? Well, we’re all still
kids at heart, and we want instant gratification.
It’s because of the 72-hour window that car
dealers need a continual radio presence.
For example, Bob finally decides to buy a new
car. Prior to making that buying decision, every
dime that every car dealer spent on advertising
was wasted on Bob, because Bob wasn’t in the
market for a new car, and he ignored all those
car ads. And after Bob has purchased his new
car, every dime that every dealer spends on
advertising once again is wasted on Bob. But,
while Bob’s 72-hour buying window is open,
every dealer needs to be on the air in case Bob
tunes in and happens to hear one of their com-
mercials. That’s why you hear so much car
advertising on the radio. All those car dealers
are waiting for Bob to make up his mind.

But, at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve, the worm turns. And that’s
the time when smart advertisers negotiate some very attractive deals with
stations. Broadcasters know that first-quarter ad dollars are harder to come
by. The competition gets fierce, and stations have to work harder for their
money. It’s first-quarter incentive time — the mother lode for businesses
looking to save money on ads.
Nearly all radio and TV stations offer first-quarter incentive packages. These
packages take many forms, but usually involve the following:
 Free commercials. (Buy one spot, get two spots free!)
 Promotions. (Buy a January schedule at full price, get February and
March schedules for half price!)
 All-expense-paid trips to destinations around the world. (Spend a cer-
tain amount over the three-month period and fly off to Europe, Mexico,
or Hawaii!)
The variations on the incentives are endless, but the bottom line is simple:
During the first quarter, you can get a lot more bang for your buck. And
people don’t quit listening to radio on the first day of January, so taking
advantage of what the stations have to offer makes sense.
Stretch your budget to the max during this new-year bonanza. If you’re
paying $150 per spot but getting another spot for free, you’re actually paying
only $75 per spot — which means you’re getting twice the impressions for
half the usual price. And, don’t forget: Radio is a frequency medium. It takes
three or four of your commercials heard by the same person to make an
impression, so the more spots you can run the better.
If, after your first quarter ad schedule has run and been paid for, you get to
board a plane for a week or more of free rest and relaxation at some exotic
resort or European capitol . . . well, you deserve it for being so darned smart!
Advertising agencies as well as its clients can earn free trips via first-quarter
incentives. My staff, our clients, and I have traveled all-expenses-paid (air,
luxury hotels, and most meals) to London, Paris, Hong Kong, Africa, Hawaii,
Mexico, and New Zealand. We’ve even cruised down the Danube River
through Germany, Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary — all in return for buying
first-quarter radio or television-broadcast packages. Hey, you’re probably
going to spend the money anyway. Why not get something extra in return?
If a client incentive package is offered to you, and if you can afford to commit
to an extended contract, grab it. Stretch your budget while taking advantage
of some great deals and wonderful trips. You deserve it.

T
V advertising still takes the lion’s share of advertising. According to
Advertising Age’s survey of U.S. ad spending in 2004, companies spent
about 25 percent of their budgets on TV. Keep in mind, though, that number
breaks down into 17.5 percent for broadcast (network and local) TV and 8.2
percent for cable TV. And the largest companies in the United States typically
spent much of this money, because they’re trying to reach the largest possi-
ble market. Nevertheless, many small businesses are also interested in adver-
tising on TV: You just need to find the best network to advertise on!
And that’s not as easy as it sounds: Buying an advertising schedule on televi-
sion is an increasingly confusing proposition. Where can you find the most
viewers? Where should you spend your money? The television audience has
fragmented because of the hundreds of choices available with broadcast,
cable, and satellite-dish technologies. The major networks’ share of total
viewing audience has been shrinking for a long time, and few see any reason
to expect the erosion to reverse. No single network, station, or program
seems to dominate anymore — people simply have too many viewing
choices. Viewers can choose among the big four networks (ABC, CBS, NBC,
and FOX), independent stations, and the numerous channels offered by cable
and satellite systems. The Internet, DVDs, VCRs, and on-demand systems like
TiVo are also vying for viewers’ attention and siphoning them away from TV.

Consumers now have such a mind-boggling variety of choices that reaching
audiences in large numbers is nearly impossible (unless you have unlimited
funds, and even then you have no guarantee). As a matter of fact, it’s not only
difficult to reach viewers in large numbers, it’s getting more challenging to
find them in large numbers. The uncertainty of where to locate substantial
numbers of television viewers has even professional media buyers confused.
Fortunately, millions and millions of people watch TV every day and every
night — even if they’re not all watching the same programs! In fact, according
to A.C. Neilsen Co. (which tracks TV viewing patterns), the average American
still spends at least 4 hours a day watching TV, and the TV is on for an aver-
age of 6 hours and 47 minutes each day in a U.S. household. And even though
some viewers tune out the commercials (either literally or electronically), TV
advertising can still offer you opportunities to reach consumers like no other
ad medium. You just have to find the right place for your commercial, where
you’re most likely to reach the customers you want to attract.
If you think that advertising on TV can benefit your business (and if your ad
bucks are burning a hole in your pocket), you need to find a reasonable share
of the total television-viewing audience (especially in the demographic group
you’re after), combined with affordable advertising rates somewhere in your
local television market. In this chapter, I help you do exactly that.
Buying the Programming, 
Not the Station
Virtually every TV station offers at least a few programs that deliver to your
target audience. Unlike radio, in which each station delivers pretty much the
same type of listener throughout the day (see Chapter 8), television demo-
graphics vary widely from program to program. Think about your own TV-
viewing habits, and you can see what I mean. The same station that airs
college football all day on weekends also airs a three-hour block of soap
operas during the day on weekdays — and those who watch the former
probably don’t watch the latter.
Don’t get locked into thinking of television in terms of stations. Think instead
in terms of programs and types of audience. If you have several stations in
your market, you may find that the best way to reach your target audience is
to buy one or two programs on each station.
216
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Depending on the size of your media market, you may likely find that if a
show won a Golden Globe or Emmy Award, you probably can’t afford it.
Commercials on the top-rated sitcoms and dramas can be very expensive,
even on a local level. But don’t despair: You can find some affordable time
slots in and around well-watched programming — affordable enough to give
you a presence in your local market even though your ad budget may not be
quite as large as that of General Motors or Anheuser-Busch, Inc.
If, on the other hand, you’re situated in a smaller advertising market, you
may indeed find that prime-time programming fits neatly within your budget
parameters. The smaller the market, the cheaper the spots.
By doing just a bit of research, you may also find that cable stations and 
independent stations (those stations not affiliated with major networks), 
offer a good variety of programming with both loyal audiences and reason-
able spot costs. For example:
 Your local network-affiliate TV stations have affordable early-morning
talk shows and morning news programs with good ratings and loyal
viewers.
 Daytime soaps and talk shows, especially if your target demographic is
women, are a great buy.
 The early-evening local news and early fringe can bring you a good
return on a modest investment. For example, my agency runs commer-
cials on Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune on the San Francisco ABC-TV
affiliate for very reasonable prices as part of a larger buy.
You’re buying the programs and the audience, not the stations. So, be sure
your target market is clearly defined before you contact the TV stations in
your market.
Comparing TV Stations: 
Request Media Kits
Contact the TV stations in your area and request a media kit. This kit is basi-
cally a brochure package with general information on the station, such as the
following:
 Coverage area
 Programming strengths
217
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television

 Special programming they’re known for
 History in the market
 Other sales-type information
Be sure the media kit includes a program listing, usually called a program
grid. This listing can give you an idea what types of programs the station airs
throughout the day. When you’ve reviewed this information, and given your-
self a brief overview of the station and its programming, you’re better pre-
pared to have a serious meeting with the station sales rep.
When you’re thinking about buying ads on TV, talk to more than one station,
if you have that option. Not only will you have a basis for comparison, but
you’re also more likely to encounter a sales rep you really like. And working
with a sales rep you like is important, because station sales reps can be your
greatest source of information. (Be sure to check out the section in this chap-
ter, “Working with a Sales Rep.”)
When you’re evaluating TV stations, don’t assume you’re comparing apples
to apples. Television stations have a wide variety of ways to present their
audience figures. The two most-common numbers you may see are:
 Household ratings: How many individual households with TV sets are
tuned into a particular station
 Demographic ratings: How many people within certain demographic
groups are tuned into the station
Stations sometimes use household ratings because they look so much 
larger — households usually consist of multiple individuals in a variety of 
different demographic groups all lumped together. However, if your target
demographic is women between the ages of 25 and 54, what difference does it
make to you how many households you’re reaching? You just want to be sure
you’re reaching the women in your target demographic. Whenever possible, 
be sure you’re looking at the ratings for your target demographic, and if the
proposal isn’t clear, ask.

Your TV Marketing Terms First!
When you’re considering buying or are already buying TV advertising, you

(yes — you can go ahead and roll your eyes). And if you’re working with

more than one station, and the stations become more competitive with one
another, they begin bombarding you with more and more detailed ratings
information. This research data they share with you is designed to show their
stations in the best possible light, while making the competing stations look
inferior. So you need to have a basic understanding of what stations are pre-
senting to you and where these numbers come from.
In the following sections, you can master the ad lingo — from sweeps to
shares — to get the TV advertising your business really needs.
Understanding timing and sweeps
Unlike radio, which is measured almost continuously, TV audiences are mea-
sured primarily four times per year. The four ratings periods are February,
May, July, and November. These periods of measurement are called sweeps,
with May and November being the most important.
The top-ten national markets (New York City; Los Angeles; Chicago;
Philadelphia; San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose area; Boston; Dallas/Fort
Worth area; Washington, D.C.; Detroit; and Atlanta, in that order) are also
measured in January and October as well. Selected top markets are also
metered, which means that audiences are measured on a daily basis via
reports called overnights. (The overnights let you know whether the latest
reality show beat out that high-rated sitcom last night.)
However, in most markets, television has to live and die by the basic four
measurement periods (the sweeps), during which networks air their best pro-
gramming and local stations promote themselves most heavily. That’s why
you rarely see reruns during the sweeps periods. Sweeps months are when
the TV stations pull out all the stops, bringing you all-new episodes of your
favorite shows.
Measuring ratings and market shares
A.C. Nielsen is the company responsible for collecting TV-ratings data in
nearly every market across the country. It does so through diaries — books
that members of randomly selected households complete, listing which
shows they watched and when.
219
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television

Nielsen also uses meters, which are electronic devices attached to a ran-
domly selected number of televisions across the country. Meters measure
whether the TV is on or off and keep track of which stations people in the
home view. Meters are only capable of providing household information on
what programs the occupants watch, because the meters have no way to
determine which household member is actually watching. Nielsen collects
the specific demographic information through the diaries (still, believe it or
not!). Some televisions are even equipped with people meters, electronic gad-
gets activated by individuals in the household when they’re watching televi-
sion and deactivated when they turn the darn thing off.
In any given market, the total number of persons or households with access
to television is referred to as the universe. Nielsen describes the viewing
levels as HUT (short for homes using television) and PUT (short for persons
using television). So, if someone were to say, “Television rates drop in the
summer because of the decrease in HUT,” it would mean that, in the summer,
fewer homes are using TV, and people are watching TV for fewer hours 
each day.
When stations present their numbers to you, the data is most likely in one of
two forms: ratings or shares. In the following sections, I describe both of
these terms.
Shares
A share is a station’s percentage of the television audience at a specific time.
For example, if a station shows you an 8 share for men 25 to 54, for its 11:00
p.m. newscast, you know that of all the men between the ages 25 and 54 who
are watching television at 11:00 p.m., 8 percent of them are watching that
particular station’s news.
Ratings
Rating is a station’s percentage of the overall universe, whether they’re
watching TV at that precise time or not. For example, if a station says its
11:00 p.m. news program delivers a 2 rating for men 25 to 54, then of all the
men between the ages of 25 and 54 in the survey universe, 2 percent watch
the 11:00 p.m. news on that station.
Ratings for individual stations can be expressed either as a percentage (2 per-
cent of all men ages 25 to 54) or as a real number (7,500 men ages 25 to 54),
but share is always a percentage. Because rating relates to the entire TV-
viewing universe, and because share relates to the HUTs or PUTs, the share
percentage is always larger. So if you compare one station’s share to another
station’s ratings, you’re comparing apples to rutabagas, and can’t get an
accurate picture. As much as possible, you want to be sure you’re comparing
the same measurement on each station.

Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Sourcing: Taking shares and ratings one step further
To get even more technical, stations source (or survey) their audience infor-
mation in one of three ways. Here is a brief outline of each:
 Actual: This number is exactly as Nielsen research reports it. If a station
gives you a February Actual, then the number came from the most-
recent February rating book.
 Projection: This number is adjusted based on a standard mathematical
formula, which is the same at every station. A projection is the HUT or
PUT level from the time of year you’re planning to advertise multiplied
by the share percentage from the most recent book. Professional media
buyers and stations often use this number, called a PJ (short for projec-
tion), and they consider PJ a good measurement because it utilizes the
most-recent information but adjusts the data to the time of the year to
account for seasonal variances in the viewing audience.
 Estimates: Estimates can literally be anything. If a station has a new pro-
gram, moves a program to a different time, is running a special, or just
feels it was shortchanged in the rating book, it uses an estimate. A sta-
tion presents an estimate as a number, footnoted with a lengthy ratio-
nale for why the station thinks the program will deliver that rating
number.
Unless estimates are all that’s available, I don’t recommend using these num-
bers in your research of stations. If an estimate is all you have, let the station
know that you will hold it to that estimated number. If the program falls short
in the next rating book, the station will need to air additional commercials for
you to make up the difference.
You may be wondering, “What would be a good rating? Can’t you give me a
guideline?” Unfortunately, because ratings and shares are percentages tied 
to population and market competition, no guidelines work across the board.
In a market with lots of competition and a large population, ratings are
smaller than in a smaller market with fewer viewing choices. As you get 
more comfortable comparing stations and programs using the information
provided in this chapter, you can soon get a feel for what constitutes good
ratings in your market.
Working with a Sales Rep
After you’ve looked through the media kits the stations in your area pro-
vided, and after you have some idea of the kinds of programs you want 
to advertise on, arrange to meet with a sales rep from each station. This
221
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television

meeting is a fact-finding mission for both of you. When you meet with the
sales rep, be very clear about your objectives, your target demographic, your
business trading area, and anything else you feel is relevant in helping her
put together a potentially successful schedule for you. Be sure she under-
stands your expectations, as well as how you plan to measure your results.
Be sure to ask lots of questions. Any sales rep who isn’t willing to help you
understand her station and the television market as a whole isn’t someone
you want to work with.
The sales rep should be motivated to help you develop something that works
for your business within your budget parameters, so that you continue to
advertise. If you don’t feel that the sales rep who comes to meet with you is
the right fit, call the station’s sales manager and request someone else. You
don’t want personality differences or a lack of trust to stand in your way
when you’re trying to make an objective decision about your advertising.
After you’ve met with the sales rep, she will go back to the station and work
on a proposal, sometimes called an avail. Occasionally, a sales rep brings a
proposal or avail to your initial meeting, but usually she wants to meet you
and gather some information before making recommendations. A typical pro-
posal includes the following information:
 The programs or dayparts (time periods) during which your ads will run
(see the nearby sidebar, “Affordable dayparts,” for more information on
dayparts)
 The number of times per week your commercial will run in each pro-
gram or daypart
 A rate for each program or daypart
 A weekly or total cost
Some stations have a special schedule already prepackaged for new advertis-
ers or clients with smaller budgets. These types of schedules usually give you
one cost for the whole schedule, as opposed to individual rates per daypart
or program. They usually have names like New Business Package or Retail
Package. These packages can be a great way to get started, but be sure you’re
aware of what they include, as well as any limitations or restrictions involved.
If the schedule includes a limited number of commercials in the areas or pro-
grams you’re interested in, you’re probably better off paying a little more for
fewer, but better targeted, commercials.
222
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Talkin’ the talk: Negotiating successfully
When you have the station’s proposal in front of you, you may find some
points that you want to negotiate. Negotiating doesn’t have to be an adver-
sarial process — and it’s almost always more effective if it’s not. In the follow-
ing sections, I fill you in on a few of the rules I’ve developed for myself over
the years as I’ve negotiated with television stations.
Telling the sales rep you want to do business
Let the sales rep know right up front that you want to do business with her
and her station. Being forthright makes the deal hers to lose (which is some-
thing she doesn’t want to do), and it gets her on your side right away. If she
knows she’s close to getting your name on a contract, you can get a lot more
of her effort than if she believes you’re just as likely to buy an ad on another
station. So, be positive, and use phrases like, “Your news rate is just a little
bit too high for me to buy the number of commercials I need, but I’d really
like to use the station. What else can you do?”
223
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television
Affordable dayparts
You may be buying television by dayparts and
not by specific programs. Buying by dayparts is
a great way to save money because it gives the
station some flexibility, which allows them to
charge a lower rate. Just be sure that all or
most of the programs that are included in the
daypart you’re buying make sense for your type
of business. Some of the standard dayparts you
can look at include:
 Morning news: 5:00 a.m.–9:00 a.m.
 Morning: 9:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m.
 Daytime: 12:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.
 Early fringe: 3:00 p.m.–5:00 p.m.
 Early news: 5:00 p.m.–7:00 p.m.
 Access: 7:00 p.m.–8:00 p.m.
 Prime: 8:00 p.m.–11:00 p.m.
 Late news: 11:00 p.m.–11:30 p.m.
 Late fringe: 11:30 p.m.–1:00 a.m.
Keep in mind that these dayparts (including
their time ranges and names) may vary slightly
from station to station, so always be sure to
clarify what the time period is. If your sales rep
gives you a proposal by daypart, also be sure to
clarify what the programming is during those
blocks of time (or refer to the program grid that
came in the station’s media kit).

Everything is negotiable!
If you think the rate is too high, ask whether the rate is flexible. If the sales
rep can’t go lower on the rate, ask whether she can add any bonus (free)
commercials to the schedule. If she can’t add any bonus commercials to 
the schedule, ask whether she can add any billboards to your schedule.
Billboards are essentially your logo with a “brought to you by” mention 
(for example, “This news brief is brought you by XYZ Cleaners”).
If you’ve offered some points of negotiation and haven’t gotten anywhere, 
it’s perfectly all right to say, “You know, I just don’t feel comfortable with this
schedule as it is. What else can you suggest?” You don’t have to explain any
further. The sales rep’s job is to come up with something that makes you feel
comfortable enough to move forward.
Letting the rep know that your advertising schedule must work
The sales rep needs to be aware that you’ll be monitoring your results
closely. After all, if this ad campaign works out well, you will be doing a lot
more advertising with the station (and if it doesn’t, you won’t). Knowing that
you’re monitoring your results offers the sales rep further incentive to make
sure your campaign is as effective as possible — and it also lets her know
that you hold her accountable if it isn’t.
Considering the time of year
As I mention in Chapter 14, the busiest time for TV (and radio) advertising
is in the spring (leading up to summer) and fall (leading up to the winter 
holidays). Stations have considerably less demand for TV ads in the first
quarter of the year (January, February, and March) and the third quarter
(July, August, and September) than in the rest of the year. January, July, and
August tend to be the lightest advertising months of all.
Therefore, stations have a lot more flexibility in the first and third quarters,
and you can push a bit further for a better deal during those times. On the
other hand, if you’re trying to buy time in the busiest months, you may not
be able to negotiate much at all (although it’s always worth a shot).
Asking for promotions and other deals
TV stations have a variety of promotions going on all the time. In addition,
they have the ability to design a traffic-building promotion specifically for
your business. As you negotiate the advertising schedule, be sure to ask what
else the station may be able to do, in addition to the advertising schedule, to
help you achieve your objective. (These additional bonuses are sometimes
referred to as value-added deals.)
224
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Getting better rates with annual or long-term contracts
Often, stations can offer you better rates, or other incentives, for making
long-term commitments. Some of these incentives may include a pool of
bonus commercials to be added to your schedule throughout the year, as
availability permits, or free trips in exchange for spending a certain dollar
amount on advertising.
Stations may put your commercials into a bonus pool if you sign a long-term
contract. The bonus pool consists of unsold commercial air time — a “pool”
of time into which certain station clients will, as their commercials reach the
front of the queue, enjoy free spots. Bonus-pool members even receive a
monthly statement showing the exact times these free spots ran. Bonus pools
can end up giving you a lot of extra impressions over the course of a year.
In addition to the bonus pool, many TV stations reward long-term commit-
ments with yearly client incentive trips (just as radio stations do, as I discuss
in Chapter 14). These trips are all-expenses-paid journeys to select destina-
tions throughout the world and are usually done in a first-class manner (not
too shabby, if you ask me). If you step up to the plate with a sizeable advertis-
ing commitment, you can often be wined and dined lavishly to make sure you
stay with the station year after year.
Incentives and lower rates can be great opportunities, if the campaign
already makes sense. Just be careful not to make commitments you wouldn’t
make otherwise just to get something for “free.” (A temptation for anyone —
including advertising gurus.)
Staying within your budget
One of the biggest mistakes new advertisers make is trying to buy too much.
You may be faced with more programming that fits your demographic than
you can afford to buy. Instead of trying to stretch your budget to cover as
many of these options as possible, you’re better off doing the opposite.
Choose one or two (maybe even three) options and buy those programs 
or dayparts as heavily as you can. Reaching some potential customers 
effectively is better than reaching a whole bunch of viewers ineffectively.
Of course, every rule has an exception! If you have the luxury of doing image
advertising, where your goal is just to let people know you’re out there, you
can go ahead and sprinkle your commercials around. Some stations even
allow you to buy all-day rotators, which air as time permits. These spots can
be a very inexpensive way to go, but remember that you have no guarantees
of when, or if, your commercials will air.
225
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television

Is Cable Advertising Right for You?
In addition to broadcast or over-the-air television, almost all markets have
the option of cable television. Unlike broadcast television, which is free to
anyone with a TV and an adequate antenna, cable television is transmitted
through a network of underground cables and is a subscription-based ser-
vice. Cable subscribers have access to additional premium channels, which
can’t be received over the air (although some are available with satellite sys-
tems). Some examples of cable channels, or networks, include ESPN, CNN,
HBO, A&E, HGTV, and MTV, to name just a few.
226
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
Don’t forget that everything can be preempted
As you evaluate your options and negotiate with
stations, keep in mind that nearly all television
commercials can be preempted. Preempted
means that if a certain program is a sellout
(meaning more people want to advertise during
the program than spaces are available), some
advertisers may choose to pay a higher rate
than you’re paying just to get in. When this hap-
pens, in order to make room, the station starts
dropping advertisers from the program based
on their priority or section code (a ranking, usu-
ally 1 through 9, of the various rates paid by
advertisers, which determines each advertiser’s
priority). If you’ve purchased your spots at level
5 — which is usually the cheapest rate for local
advertisers — you will be told up front that your
rate is preemptible, so you shouldn’t have any
surprises.
The issue date (when you, as an advertiser,
bought a schedule) is also a factor. The last one
in is the first one bumped. So if, for example,
you’re having a sale next weekend, you want to
be sure that you don’t negotiate rates so low
that all your commercials can get preempted.
Believe me, it has happened. On the other hand,
if you have some flexibility, getting bumped may
be less of a concern, and you should go for the
cheaper rates.
Your station sales rep gets a preemption list
daily for all her clients, and part of your negoti-
ation is making sure she knows what you want
done with your bumped spots. The options gen-
erally include the following:
 Run the commercial in the same program
on a different day or week.
 Run the commercial in a comparable program.
 Credit the cost of the commercial back to
you.
Before you sign your contract, be sure to dis-
cuss with your sales rep what happens when
your commercials get bumped, so your invoice
isn’t full of surprises!

Keep in mind that not all cable channels are commercial channels that accept
advertising, and not all are available to local advertisers. Check with your
local cable company to find out which channels in your area are available for
local retail advertising.
Cable offers the visual impact of television without the broad reach. Because
so many cable networks are available to viewers, each one has become
highly targeted and reaches a very specific audience. So, if you have a sport-
ing goods store, you’re probably going to focus on sports-related networks,
like ESPN, Fox Sports, or ESPN 2. If, on the other hand, you own a day spa,
you can focus on networks more appealing to women, such as HGTV (Home
& Garden Television) or Lifetime. Not all situations are this clear-cut, of
course, but the point is that cable networks have very specific target audi-
ences, making it easy to eliminate those channels that aren’t appropriate to
you and to concentrate on the ones that better fit your target demographic.
In addition to targeting your customers by specific network, some of the
larger markets offer cable advertising by zone. Zones are individual geo-
graphical areas within a cable system’s total sphere of influence — small
pieces of the cable pie. Zoning allows smaller advertisers to buy advertising
only in the zones immediately surrounding their place of business. The San
Francisco Bay Area, for example, has 11 regional cable zones as well as sev-
eral subzones. So, if you have a clothing store in a particular San Jose suburb,
you can buy cable advertising in the zone that covers just those households
that are located nearby. On the other hand, if you have a chain of auto parts
stores, with locations in various cities throughout the Bay Area, you can
place your advertising in all zones, or market-wide.
A word of caution: The more complex your buy — the more networks and
specific zones you choose — the more complex your invoices are. Talk with
your sales rep about this issue up front so you have no surprises when your
bill comes. You may find that you receive a separate invoice for each network
included on your schedule, as well as for each zone, so be prepared! This
amount of paperwork can be overwhelming and has been known to make
even a professional advertising Accounts Payable Manager break down into
uncontrollable sobbing.
Working effectively with a cable sales rep
So you’re thinking that cable sounds pretty good and you want to explore it
further. But you’re frightened by a nagging thought: Do you have to meet
sales reps from each network? Luckily, your local cable company has an
advertising department, and a sales rep from that office will be happy to sell
you commercials on any or all of their available networks, and in any or all of
227
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television

their zones. Depending on your local cable operator’s agreement with the
networks, it can insert your commercials on several networks, or on just a
few. However, in all markets, the programming and the commercial inventory
is controlled by the network, not the cable company.
Your first step is to contact the cable company and set up a meeting with an
advertising sales rep. In general, this meeting will be a lot like meeting a net-
work TV rep (check out “Working with a Sales Rep” earlier in this chapter),
but you should know about a few nuances of cable. This meeting is an oppor-
tunity for your cable rep to get to know your business in order to prepare a
proposal, but it’s also an important opportunity for you to find out what
options are available to you in your market. At the conclusion of this first
meeting, you should know:
 What networks are available to you locally
 Whether your market is zoned
 The amount of local control on where your commercials can air
 Anything else unique to buying cable advertising in your neck of 
the woods
Your sales rep will want to come back with a proposal, and this part of the
deal is where it could get tricky. Cable advertising has a reputation for some-
times being really cheap, and there is a reason for that: It’s not uncommon for
cable reps to sell very broad rotators (which are commercial spots run during
available times, rather than prescheduled times, at the discretion of the sta-
tion) over a single network or across several networks. They have so much
commercial inventory that they may as well sell it for something! However,
although just $2 or $3 per commercial (yes, cable time sometimes sells for a
seemingly paltry amount) sounds too good to pass up, believe me it isn’t. If
you’re advertising power drills and your $2 commercial runs in a 3:00 a.m.
program on the Women’s Network about getting in shape after you’ve had a
baby, you just threw away three bucks. If your entire advertising schedule is
made up of these cheap rotators, the likelihood of your commercial airing in
prime time and on an appropriate network is slim. Cable companies don’t
give the good stuff away, and when you realize that fact, you can see that
cable isn’t always as “cheap” as it seems.
If you want to buy a spot during the Major League Baseball Championship
Series or the Stanley Cup Finals on ESPN, you pay a premium. If you buy a
rotator on ESPN, hoping to land in this well-watched programming, you will
be disappointed. You definitely won’t end up in the game. You may end up in
the pre- or post-game, but then again, you may end up in the Introduction to
Knitting or Celebrity Skeet Shooting hours. Don’t risk it.
228
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Hitting the bull’s-eye with cable ads
Cable’s biggest strength is its targetability, so use it. Buy programs or time
periods on the appropriate networks, as specifically as you can. Then ask 
the sales rep to include some really cheap (or free) rotators in addition to
your negotiated schedule. You can always check your invoices to see where
and at what times the rotators ran and decide whether they’re a worthwhile
investment.
These cheapo rotator commercials can be a great way to enhance a schedule,
but they should never be the meat of your campaign. Remember: If it seems
too cheap to be true, it probably is. You get what you pay for.
Doing the math: Cable TV 
market penetration
One thing you should become educated on before you commit to any cable
advertising is market penetration, the percentage of the total television house-
holds in your market that subscribe to cable. This topic is an important one
to ask about before you evaluate the potential effectiveness of cable in your
market. Your cable reps have this information (and so do your broadcast 
television reps, who use it to steer you away from cable).
Market penetration information, as it applies to cable, is important for a
couple of reasons:
 Penetration tells you the maximum number of households you can
reach. For example, if the cable penetration in your market is 50 per-
cent, then the top-rated cable network in your market has the potential
to reach only half of the total households in your area. That percentage
also means you’re eliminating half of your market right off the bat.
 Demographics and location of cable subscribers can further limit your
reach. Looking at the remaining 50 percent who are cable subscribers,
you need to narrow them down by demographics and geography, if
applicable, in order to come up with the actual number of potential cus-
tomers you can reach with your commercials.
By the time you slice and dice these numbers, they can end up fairly small. In
fact, most cable networks (even the strongest, such as TNT, A&E, and TNN)
don’t deliver enough audience consistently enough to show up in the Nielsen
rating book (for more info, see “Measuring ratings and market shares” in this
chapter). And because they don’t deliver enough audience to show up on
Nielsen research, most cable companies use their own research, which is
cable-specific.
229
Chapter 15: Getting Your Ads on Television

Cable-specific research is fine, as long as they don’t try to compare their
research numbers to “over-the-air” television. Broadcast television ratings 
are based on a market population of total television households. Cable ratings, 
on the other hand, are based on a market population of cable households. This
number can be much smaller than the total universe for television, depending
on the cable penetration. Obviously, if cable doesn’t penetrate 100 percent of
the television households in the market, they would be at quite a disadvantage
if they used the larger universe as the basis for determining their ratings. So,
they use the smaller universe of cable households. And for this reason, you
can’t directly compare broadcast television ratings and cable ratings. If you 
do, you’re comparing apples to rutabagas again.
Before you sign a contract, do the math to see whether advertising on cable
makes sense for your business. Let’s say your market consists of 100,000 tele-
vision households. The cable penetration is 60 percent, which means 60,000
households have cable. The morning news on your local NBC affiliate, a
broadcast television station, does a 2 household rating. The cable network,
CNBC, has a morning news program, which also does a 2 rating, but with
cable households. The 2 rating on the local NBC affiliate represents 2,000
households (2 percent of 100,000 households), while the 2 rating for CNBC
represents just 1,200 households (2 percent of 60,000). So if you advertise on
the broadcast station, you reach 800 more households than if you advertise
on the cable station, even though both of them have a 2 household rating.
230
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
You don’t always get what you pay for
I once produced a TV spot for a Volkswagen
dealer specifically targeted to women between
25 and 49. The 30-second spot featured an on-
camera pitch by a well-dressed young woman
who stood near the car in a lovely outdoor set-
ting and outlined the many virtues of the new
Jetta. She explained why it was perfect for the
driving needs of busy professional women on
the go. Our media department very carefully
picked only cable programming for women —
Lifetime, HGTV, and stations like them. We
bought a fairly heavy schedule and anticipated
good results.
A week or so later, whilst having lunch at a
sports bar, I glanced up at the TV above the bar
to watch a show called The Lumberjack
Olympics, which was being televised on ESPN2.
Big, burly, sweaty guys in bib overalls and hob-
nail boots were chopping trees to bits with
incredibly sharp axes, climbing trees in ten sec-
onds, doing log rolling, and performing all sorts
of other macho feats of strength and dexterity.
Guess which 30-second spot was the very first
one I saw? Yep, our businesswoman selling VW
Jettas.
The moral of this story is simply this: Read your
cable invoices very carefully to make sure you
get what you paid for. In fairness, I must report
that the spot I saw on ESPN2 turned out to be a
bonus spot and free of charge. However, free or
not, it didn’t do us one bit of good, because you
could bet that not one female viewer was within
a thousand miles of that programming.

Although cable television delivers a smaller audience than over-the-air televi-
sion, this doesn’t have to be a disadvantage for you as an advertiser. After all,
cable is usually less expensive, which means you can buy more commercials.
In addition, cable can offer excellent targeting opportunities, both geographi-
cally and demographically.
You may decide you don’t want to handle all these details on your own after
all. That is, you still want to advertise on TV, but you just don’t want to have
to become an expert in TV production and scheduling. The good news is that
you don’t have to do all this work yourself: Instead, you can work with a
media buyer. Luckily, Chapter 16 tells you all about how to avoid these
headaches and turn them over to someone else — either a media buying 
service or a full-fledged ad agency.

Deciding Whether to 
Hire an Ad Agency
In This Chapter
 Figuring out when to give your account to an agency — and how to choose one
 Understanding what an ad agency can do for you and who’s involved in the process
 Knowing how an agency gets compensated for its work
 Communicating with your agency so that your ads — and your business — succeed
W
hen you hire an ad agency, you’re taking a giant leap of faith that
these professionals can do a better job of promoting your business
than you can do yourself. One sure way to make this a self-fulfilling prophecy
is to give them a loose rein. Here are a few suggestions on how to do that:
 Let their creative department shine.
 Allow their media buyers to use their hard-earned experience to spend
your media money wisely and effectively.
 Don’t hire an agency and then dictate what it must do or what media it
must buy.
 Don’t turn down creative advertising ideas simply because they’re not
something you would have thought of yourself.
An agency can be only as good as its clients, and the best clients are those
who recognize that, although advertising professionals can never know as
much about your business as you do, they absolutely know more about creat-
ing and placing effective advertising. Your account will be important to your
agency, and if your agency is truly dedicated to being your marketing partner,
it will do everything it can to assure your business success and its long-range
future with you.
In this chapter, I help you decide when to stop trying to do everything your-
self and turn your advertising over to an ad agency — and how to find the
right agency for your ad needs. I also clue you in on how agencies get paid so

you can decide what’s the best financial arrangement for you. Finally, I offer
some advice on how best to work with your agency so your advertising
accomplishes your goals: to get more business!
Determining When You May Need 
to Hire an Agency
Deciding when you need to hire an agency to help with your ads can be diffi-
cult. Here are some situations when hiring an agency makes sense:
 When phone calls from media sales reps are taking up too much of your
time (see the nearby sidebar for more about this problem)
 When you’re simply overwhelmed by the myriad details inherent in pro-
ducing and placing your advertising
 When you no longer have the time, or the energy, to write and produce
your advertising yourself
 When creating and placing your advertising on a regular basis has
become a job instead of fun
 When your own creative efforts aren’t yielding the results you desire
 When your advertising budget has grown so much that you’re no longer
certain you’re spending it as wisely as you could be
 When the bookkeeping process of sorting through multiple media
invoices each month has become too complicated and time-consuming
 When you finally admit that media invoices are written in a secret code
that you’ll never decipher, and you want to be assured that you’re get-
ting everything you’re paying for
 When you’re eager to have creative professionals generate fresh, new
ideas for your advertising
 When you want to put a team of highly trained specialists to work, with
the common goal of growing your business
 When you would welcome the professional creative, account service,
and media buying expertise that an agency can provide
 When you’d like to do co-op advertising but don’t want to hassle with
the administrative details of finding co-op opportunities (that’s a mouth-
ful!) and following up on the funds
In addition, one of the first issues you should determine is whether you need
a PR firm with design capabilities, an ad agency with some PR experience, or
a true converged firm that can recommend and deliver PR and advertising.
234
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Check out Chapter 18 for more info on PR and publicity. One of the major
trends in marketing is an increase in PR over advertising; in advertising itself,
the trend is an increase in promotion and interactive ads.
You don’t need an advertising budget in the millions to seek out the services
of an ad agency. Many local agencies provide you with all the services offered
by the major agencies, but they’re scaled down to fit within your budget and
your advertising requirements. These agencies are the one-person shops and
the smaller agencies that handle retail, direct-response advertising for all
kinds of local and regional accounts.
When it comes to advertising agencies, one size doesn’t fit every business. All
full-service shops (that’s advertising slang for agencies) perform the same
duties; provide the same services; have the same access to research and media
opportunities; employ the very best, most-talented people they can afford;
offer the finest creative product they can possibly conjure up; and earn essen-
tially the same remuneration, with one major difference — the size of their
clients’ businesses and their clients’ budgets, as you can see in the following:
 The giants of the advertising industry handle the major national and
international accounts — such as General Motors, which spends billions
of dollars each year on advertising (yes, that’s billions with a b).
 The not-so-giant agencies typically handle regional, not-so-giant
accounts, though they may also handle some national (and even interna-
tional) clients, especially business-to-business accounts. Also, many of
the regional offices of the giant agencies compete for and serve rela-
tively small accounts: For example, Publicis in Indianapolis served the
Indiana State Museum with a very modest budget.
 Small local ad agencies, for the most part, specialize in retail accounts,
such as local furniture stores, clothing boutiques, wedding or party loca-
tions, and caterers.
 Some agencies specialize in the design and development of collateral
materials, Web site and Internet advertising design, the production of
corporate videos, and other niches.
Agencies like mine have billings of several million dollars a year but nothing
close to the astronomical billings of the major shops. The services we per-
form for our accounts are many and varied, and each account requires differ-
ent services. But essentially, we, like all agencies, handle for our accounts
everything from writing and designing ads, to negotiating with and buying the
various media, and all the many details in between.
The best advice I have regarding the size of an agency is to select one where
your account will be important. Talk frankly about your budget and ask —
and check — references of at least three other clients with similar budgets.
235
Chapter 16: Deciding Whether to Hire an Ad Agency

These smaller agencies also know your local market intimately and may even
specialize in a particular business segment such as health care, financial,
telecommunications, or automotive. They know the local media; they know
which radio stations are hot and which ones are not; they know rate cards
and demographics and all the important research data relevant to your local
market that they can put to good use when handling your business. They’re
friends with station owners and managers, newspaper editors and retail
advertising managers, account executives and creative talent. They’re a
wealth of local knowledge.
Advertising is an extremely important part of your overall marketing plan.
Hiring a team of professionals to handle it for you is something you should
think about. When you hire an advertising agency, you eliminate a lot of daily
phone calls and drop-in visits from various reps so you can focus on running
your business. You also, in all likelihood, receive a more-polished creative
product from the agency than you’ve been producing, because a whole gang
of professional writers, designers, and creative directors are working on your
business. And, in the case of many local ad agencies, it very likely won’t cost
you as much as you think.
Finding the Right Agency 
for Your Business
If you do decide that you need to hire an ad agency, you need to spend some
time finding a good one. You want to find an agency that lists its specialty as
retail, local, or direct response — an agency that operates on a local or
regional level. When you’re looking for an ad agency, don’t just let your fin-
gers do the walking through your local Yellow Pages and expect to find the
best one right off the bat. Any of the media reps or sales reps who call on
your account can put you in touch with some good ones, possibly agencies
that specialize in your business arena. Of course, the agencies they recom-
mend are the agencies that they work with, but after all, fair is fair.
If media reps or sales reps aren’t calling on you, you can find an agency in
more creative ways. Have you seen or heard an ad for a local business that
was particularly creative and really caught your attention? Call the newspa-
per or the station that ran the ad and ask about it. Talk with the paper’s
Retail Sales Department or the station’s Traffic Department and ask which
agency is responsible for the ad. Then give that agency a call. What could be
simpler? Upon receiving your call, the agency will be immediately flattered
and will dispatch an account executive or account supervisor to your busi-
ness to chat you up and try to get your business.
236
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

Nowadays most agencies also have Web sites. You can research the agency’s
work and its client list before you even call. See what the agency is doing
first, and find out if it’s compatible with what you’re looking for. Figure out
who the agency’s clients are and whether its client mix appears to match
with your specialty.
Then, invite a few agencies to come to your office to make their pitches —
this is called an agency review. When the word gets out that you’re having an
agency review (and the speed with which industry gossip spreads never
ceases to amaze me), you’ll get calls from many agencies that you haven’t
personally contacted. That’s okay: You may want to give them an appoint-
ment, too. Get to know each one, listen to what each has to say, look at and
listen to their creative work, and see whether it feels right. Be sure to think
about which of the agency account executives you will be able to get along
with over the long haul. Check each agency’s references and then make your
choice. (More about account execs in the next section of this chapter.)
Many extremely competent, enormously talented, small or local advertising
agencies are out there. With just a bit of research, you can find the one you
feel most comfortable with.
Getting to Know the People 
Handling Your Account
Advertising agencies are made up of people performing many different jobs.
Smaller agencies may not employ people in all these positions (in that case,
the agency’s employees may take on the responsibilities of more than one
position and may even have a network of freelancers available as needed),
but you may end up working someday with an agency that does. So knowing
who the players are and what they do is always a good idea:
 Owners and senior management: These top guns usually are the people
who meet with you initially, with their creative and account service staff,
to make their pitch for becoming your ad agency. Unless their agency is
very small, they aren’t usually involved in the day-to-day servicing of
your account.
 Account supervisor: This person supervises the creative and account
service team handling your account on a daily basis. (She probably also
supervises other accounts in addition to yours.) This person makes sure
things are running smoothly in the day-to-day servicing of your business
and usually has the last word when it comes time to make creative,
account service, and billing decisions.
237
Chapter 16: Deciding Whether to Hire an Ad Agency

 Account executive: This member of the ad team services your account on
a daily basis. He may have been the person who originally called on you
and solicited your business in the first place. Depending on the size of the
ad agency, the account executive may handle more than one account. The
number of accounts the account executive handles is usually predicated
on total advertising budgets: The bigger the budget, the more work is
involved and, ergo, the fewer accounts handled by one person.
 Creative Director: This person typically oversees and shapes all the cre-
ative product, for all media, that the agency develops and designs for
your business — radio, TV, print, whatever. The creative director super-
vises the writers, designers, photographers, actors, voice talents, and
anyone else who contributes to the final creative product.
 Copywriter: As the job title says, the copywriter takes the basic facts
about your business and writes the copy for your ads — hopefully, with
wit, humor, or drama, and, above all, sell.
 Graphic Designer/Artist: Your graphics guy or artist works with the
copywriter to make print and collateral advertising sparkle with eye-
catching, unusual graphic elements and typefaces.
 Media buyer: You need to spend your limited and very important time
productively running your business, and the media buyer helps you do
just that. She negotiates the deals for buying the media you need for the
ads your agency has created, fields the phones calls, and takes the meet-
ings with the dozens of media reps. A good media buyer is fair but firm
with the media, insisting on the correct format, impressive ratings or cir-
culation, and the right audience composition and demographic before
committing your hard-earned dollars to any ad medium.
A media buyer also does the very important job of post analysis, in
which she pores over the media invoices to make sure everything
bought is accounted for. And if she’s diligent and knowledgeable, she
gives you the most bang for your buck and stretches your media budget,
regardless of its size, as tightly as it can be stretched without breaking.
The biggest benefit of using a professional media buyer — who has soft-
ware to analyze and optimize your media buy — is that you can gain sig-
nificant additional exposure within your target market and get significant
savings and added value from professional media negotiation and buying.
Compensating Your Agency
As much as I enjoy creating wonderful advertising, as much as I look forward
to writing a new commercial that presents a client’s message in a fresh, new
238
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

way, and as much as I appreciate the talents of those who work around me
and the faith and trust placed in my agency by our clients, I also really like
the getting-paid part! Nothing says, “I love you” like a big, fat check at the end
of each month.
Advertising legend David Ogilvy gave the best advice I could ever direct
toward an account: “Make sure that your agency makes a profit. Your account
competes with all the other accounts in your agency. If it is unprofitable, it is
unlikely that the management of the agency will assign their best people to
work on it. And sooner or later they will cast about for a profitable account to
replace yours.”
You wouldn’t work for free, so why should your ad agency? I have handled a
few accounts during my career that begrudged every nickel I earned from
them. It put too much strain on the business relationship, and I replaced (or
simply resigned) those accounts at my first opportunity.
Advertising professionals, like any professionals, have the right to be paid a
professional’s wage. But (and here’s some news that should allay your fears)
advertising agencies don’t cost nearly as much as most people assume. In the
following sections, I clue you in to how the media you choose gets paid, what
creating and then producing your ads can cost you, and whether you want to
pay your agency a markup on its work or a regular retainer.
Media commissions
Since the dawn of advertising history, and because of some obscure arrange-
ment made between the early founders of the advertising agency business
and the newspapers of the time, an agency used to earn a media commission
of 15 percent. Recently, however, the commission system has greatly eroded.
More common than commissions are hourly charges for media planning,
buying, and tracking.
If commissions are used, they are routinely negotiated based on the size and
complexity of the media buy and services required: They generally range
from 5 to 15 percent. Small or complex media buys on an hourly basis may
require 20 percent or more of the media budget.
You can find a lot of research on agency compensation with the small business
owner in mind. One source for smaller agencies you may want to check out is
Second Wind, which is a network of agencies and the like (www.secondwind
network.com).
239
Chapter 16: Deciding Whether to Hire an Ad Agency

The traditional commission is paid to the agency by the media in the form of
a discount. If you buy a newspaper ad with a space cost of $1,000 directly
from the paper, you are charged $1,000. If your ad agency buys the same ad, it
is charged $850, but the agency bills you for the full $1,000 and keeps the rest
($150, or 15 percent) as its commission. So, in effect, having an agency place
your media buys doesn’t cost you a dime, because you’re paying the same
amount to buy that ad whether you have an agency handle it for you or you
do it yourself — it’s just that if you buy it with the help of an agency, some of
your money goes to the agency as well as to the newspaper.
Creative and production charges
Agencies also charge their clients for something they call creative and produc-
tion, which is essentially the writing and designing of the ad. How much an
agency charges varies from agency to agency. So before you commit to
having an agency design an ad or produce a radio or TV spot for you, ask the
agency how much it charges for creative and production.
240
Part III: Buying the Different Media 
Procter & Gamble bucks the system — and 
reallocates how it spends its bucks
Procter & Gamble has changed the way it pays
its ad agencies. According to The Wall Street
Journal (“In a Shift, Marketers Beef Up Ad
Spending Inside Stores,” by Emily Nelson and
Sarah Ellison, September 21, 2005), P&G worried
that agencies that were paid commissions on
media costs would naturally tend to develop ads
that cost a lot — especially expensive TV com-
mercials. So it now links compensation to its ad
agencies to product-sales increases. This
change may not make the agencies happy, but
it certainly is a fair incentive.
And more changes may be afoot: P&G reduced
its cable TV advertising by 25 percent in 2005
and its broadcast TV ads by 5 percent, even
while increasing its overall ad budget for the
year. Where did that money go? To a new type
of advertising: In-store ads, where P&G
believes that consumers make most of their 
purchase decisions anyway. P&G calls it first
moment of truth (FMOT) and has hired 50
Directors of FMOT (pronounced “Eff-mott”).
Finally, if you think just one company is making
changes, consider that P&G popularized the
concept of mass-market advertising almost 100
years ago, and it’s still considered the go-to
place for marketers just starting out in their
careers to figure out how to market and adver-
tise effectively. Also, keep in mind that P&G is a
consumer-goods powerhouse of brands, includ-
ing Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and
Pampers diapers, to name just a few. Where
P&G leads, others may follow.

Some agencies have truly astounding creative charges (especially those that
don’t earn additional monies from media commissions); other agencies have
fairly modest charges. The bottom line is that the media commission isn’t
enough to cover the cost of running an agency, and the addition of creative
and production charges to the clients’ invoices is a necessary one, so be pre-
pared to pay for it.
Markups
An agency also adds a markup to all the buyouts it makes on your behalf.
Buyouts are charges incurred by the agency for voice talent, recording stu-
dios, photographers, models, actors, props, photography, printing, commer-
cial recording, filming, film editing, and so on — basically, everything that
outside vendors contribute to the cost of producing your advertising.
Because the agency went on the hook to order these vendors and the agency
is ultimately responsible for payment, these charges are added to your
monthly invoice along with an agency markup. The markup your agency
charges is another item you may want explained to you before approving cer-
tain creative and production jobs. You don’t want any surprises when it
comes time to pay your bill.
Retainers
Sometimes an agency and a client work out a monthly retainer, which is a set
monthly fee you pay the agency for its services. The retainer may be in addi-
tion to agency commissions, or it may be in place of them — it depends on
how much you (as the client) are spending on advertising and on whether all
the media options the agency is purchasing for you are commissionable.
For instance, if you’re buying only newspaper advertising at a retail rate — a
reduced rate to make the publication more affordable for local advertisers
like you — your agency usually won’t earn a commission on that space. Why?
Because the retail rate is usually so low that newspapers refuse to subtract a
15 percent commission from it. Instead of having your agency add markups
to each newspaper invoice, you and your agency may opt for a monthly
retainer figure that comes close to the amount of commissions that the
agency would have earned had the newspaper space been invoiced at a
higher rate.
Newspapers have very complicated, sometimes arbitrary, rate cards that
make agency retainers a necessary evil in some cases. Retail ad space for a
241
Chapter 16: Deciding Whether to Hire an Ad Agency

furniture store, for example, isn’t commissionable, but automotive advertis-
ing for a local car dealer — which is, most certainly, retail — is commission-
able. If you can figure out why this difference exists, drop me a note, because
I never have been able to.
I’ve also never liked the idea of charging a retainer. Inevitably, either the
client or the agency feels it’s getting the short end of the stick. But in some
cases, retainers are unavoidable, even desirable. However, the monthly dollar
amount is something that needs to be carefully worked out between the two
parties. Retainer agreements can be beneficial to both clients and agencies.
For you, the client, a retainer may guarantee you a certain amount of access
to the agency and all of its personnel, regardless of the size of your media
budget. For the agency, the retainer helps it plan for the number of people
who are directly employed to handle your account.
Working with Your Agency 
to Get What You Need
You hire an ad agency because you want to put its expertise to work for you.
The advertising gurus know advertising, but they don’t know your business.
So when you hire an agency, keep one thing in mind: You must have a contin-
ual dialogue with your agency contact person to be sure you’re working
toward the same goal. Tell your contact everything you can possibly think of
that’s relevant to the advertising that will be created for your account —
regardless of how minuscule and unimportant this detailed information may
seem. Your agency needs to know as much as it can about your products and
services in order to sift through the information to find your unique selling
proposition (what is it that separates you from the herd?) and to develop the
creative hook (a fresh, new way to tell the world about you and your busi-
ness) that it uses when creating your ads.
You expect from your agency the finest possible creative product for your
account. But that product can never live up to your expectations if the
agency has to guess about what you want to convey to the buying public. The
more facts you can provide, the easier it is for the agency writers, designers,
and media buyers to make quality decisions when producing your advertis-
ing and placing it on the various media.
Tell your agency as much about your product and business as possible, and
keep updating this information as time passes. Here are some key types of
information you need to share with your agency:
242
Part III: Buying the Different Media 

 What makes your product so great and why people should buy it
 Which demographic group is your prime market
 What is unique about what you’re providing (for example, your service,
location, convenient hours)
 Whether you compete with giant, impersonal chain stores
 Whether you offer free delivery, a lifetime guarantee, or something the
consumer won’t find elsewhere
In addition to the information about your business that you’ll provide for
your agency, any good agency will want to dig far deeper. Good agencies
learn their client’s business. They read the client’s industry trade magazines,
spend time in the store observing customers, or tag along on sales calls.
They attend trade shows and interview your major customers. They cry for
research on your market, customers, competitors, and more. Keep that in
mind when interviewing agencies: They should want to know as much about
your business as you do!
Your agency will likely want to set a regular meeting time with you (for exam-
ple, weekly or monthly). These regular meetings are a great time for you to
impart all your wisdom regarding your business. If anything relevant pops
into your mind outside of this meeting, call your account executive. The 
more your agency knows about your business, the better the ads it can
create for you.
If your agency seems disinterested in the details you’re sharing or doesn’t
want to hear your ideas, or worse, doesn’t ask you tons of questions, start
looking for another agency. You want to find an ad agency that views itself as
an advertising partner and that views you as an integral part of the success
of the ad campaigns it creates for you.

on’t be afraid to go outside the box, especially when
it comes to telling the world about your business.
Buzz and word of mouth are free (or at least low-budget)
ways to get your message out. And publicity –– sending a
press release to a publication in the hopes of getting some
free ink –– is most certainly a form of advertising.
In addition, premium items –– the giveaway refrigerator
magnets, key chains, mouse pads, and coffee mugs you
know and love –– as well as promotions and events
(whether radio station invented or created by you) are
unique modes of advertising. As part of an overall ad 
campaign, each of these ad models can increase your
exposure in the marketplace. And in this part, I show 
you how to make them work for you.

 Recognizing the value of word-of-mouth marketing
 Choosing among various ways to generate buzz
A
dvertising today not only includes the paid placement of marketing mes-
sages but also some free methods of getting your message out. Buzz and
word-of-mouth marketing fit into this category — though you can also spend
money to create buzz or great word of mouth. In this chapter, I explain what
you need to know about these tactics and show you examples of how they
work in the real world so you can put them to work for your own business.
Getting the Terminology Straight
Just in case you’re still thinking that word-of-mouth marketing isn’t a legiti-
mate, controllable, manageable approach to promoting your product or service,
think again. An entire professional association is devoted to word-of-mouth mar-
keting, called (natch) the Word of Mouth Marketing Association, or WOMMA —
a hilariously memorable acronym. (If you want to know more, its Web site is
www.womma.org, and it’s based in Chicago.)
More important, though, is the fact that WOMMA consists of corporate 
members only (not individuals), which means that big companies are just as
interested in word-of-mouth marketing as small businesses and solo entrepre-
neurs. For example, just look at a few of the companies that are, at the time of
this writing, members of WOMMA — the A&E TV network, Coca-Cola, Dell
computers, General Motors, Yahoo!, and Zondervan religious publishing.

Moreover, Adweek magazine published a feature article on the topic of word-
of-mouth marketing in October 24, 2005 (“Psst! How Do You Measure Buzz?”).
The article described the rise of buzz and word of mouth, and it clarified, by
way of WOMMA definitions, the subtle yet important differences between
these recent marketing terms, which I share with you here:
 Word of mouth: The act of consumers providing information to other
consumers.
 Word-of-mouth marketing: Giving people a reason to talk about your
products and services and making it easier for that conversation to take
place.
 Buzz marketing: Using high-profile entertainment or news to get people
to talk about your brand.
 Viral marketing: Creating entertaining or informative messages that are
designed to be passed along in an exponential fashion, often electroni-
cally or by e-mail.
Now that you know what’s what, keep reading to see how word-of-mouth mar-
keting really works.
Seeing the Power of Word of Mouth
Many advertising, publicity, and marketing experts believe that word-of-
mouth marketing is the most powerful type of exposure that you can get for
your product, service, business, or store. After all, who are you most likely to
believe? A paid advertisement, featuring an actor who earns his fee by recit-
ing a script written by a salaried copywriter working for a hired ad agency?
Or the unsolicited suggestion by one of your friends that “you should see this
movie; you’ll love it!” or “buy that car; it’s really reliable,” or “try this restau-
rant, or gift shop, or dry cleaner, or face cream, or sneaker, or computer, or
cell phone”?
Obviously, you’re more likely to listen to your friend. After all, she hasn’t
been paid to recommend that product or business. She gains nothing if you
do or don’t try it. She’s simply telling you what she loves or appreciates —
and that’s a powerful endorsement for any business. Now all you have to do
is get those powerful endorsements!
In the following sections, I offer up a few examples of how word of mouth has
worked effectively, for positive business results — and I show you how to pre-
vent the opposite: negative buzz. For celebrities, it may be true that “there’s
no such thing as bad publicity,” but the same isn’t true of businesses!

Examining word-of-mouth 
marketing success stories
You can find plenty of real-world examples showing how successful word-of-
mouth promotion can be. You probably have even experienced it as a con-
sumer. In order to launch your own word-of-mouth campaign, you can glean
some valuable tips by first looking at the success stories of others.
Emanuel Rosen describes a broad spectrum of these successes in his book The
Anatomy of Buzz (Currency). Rosen describes how buzz was completely and
absolutely responsible for consumer awareness of a software product he was
involved with (called Endnote, a program to help academics footnote their
sources more easily, to meet different guidelines without having to re-type 
each source). He was able to track consumer awareness to buzz (something he
considers synonymous with word of mouth) because the company hadn’t done
any marketing or advertising or publicity when people started to call and ask
about it. In fact, the product wasn’t even available when the company received
its first order! But the company had done a sneak preview locally, and word
spread about it nationally. That first order came in from 3,000 miles away.
Word of mouth has been responsible for the success of other high-tech prod-
ucts as well. But it’s not only the geeks in the world of computer technology
who buzz about a product; it happens in the larger world, too. When was the
first time you considered getting an MP3 player or a PDA? For most people,
these gadgets became enticing only after hearing a friend or coworker rave
about his new toy.
How many people make travel and vacation plans based on what people they
know recommend or buy cars because of buzz about a particular style? How
many times have you gone to the movies based on what your friends are talk-
ing about or recommend — often, even when you had no interest in a particu-
lar movie until people we know start buzzing about it? For example, remember
The Crying Game? The Sixth Sense? And The Blair Witch Project? All of those
movies benefited from buzz and word-of-mouth marketing.
People tend to buzz about certain types of products. Rosen did a great job
narrowing down six categories of product that can generate buzz: products
that are exciting, innovative, complex, expensive, observable (you can see
others using them), or that involve personal experience. If any aspect of your
business, product, or service fits into any of those categories, you should
focus on that aspect when trying to generate buzz.
Books are another typical product that benefit from great word of mouth. In
fact, book publicists typically send a copy of a new book to a targeted list of
249
Chapter 17: Creating Buzz and Word-of-Mouth Advertising

“big mouths” whom they know will talk up a book that they enjoyed. To book
publishers, being a big mouth isn’t a bad thing at all. Those people know a lot
of people, they talk to many people regularly, they’re free with their opinions,
and people listen to what they say and what they recommend. Big mouths
spread the word about a new book, and they can help it get noticed and sell —
which is increasingly tough to do given the enormous number of new books
that are published every year.
You may be surprised at the success stories of many titles you’re familiar
with. Rosen talks about how buzz contributed to the success of one such
book: Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier (Grove Press). And Malcolm Gladwell,
in his book The Tipping Point (Back Bay Books), writes about another book
that caused a sensation: Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood by Rebecca
Wells (HarperCollins). Interestingly, word of mouth was responsible for the
enormous success of each book, but the buzz on the two books happened in
very different ways: One was top-down, and the other was bottom-up.
In the case of Cold Mountain, the buzz was driven from the top-down. The book
started to sell as soon as it was published, but it became a bestseller because
the publisher wrote personal letters to key booksellers and sent copies to
people he thought would be key readers (and therefore had big mouths).
In the case of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, the book didn’t sell par-
ticularly well at first. It got a few good reviews and sold a modestly successful
number of copies in the original hardcover edition. When the book came out
in paperback, though, the author noticed that groups of women would come
to bookstores to have her sign their copies, and they were buying several
copies of the book for their friends. What had happened was that readers had
identified with the theme of the book and were reading it in bookclubs and
other communities, and those communities started to buzz. That word-of-
mouth groundswell caused the book to sell 2.5 million copies.
Beware of negative buzz!
A product can also be affected adversely by negative buzz. Remember the prob-
lem with Intel’s Pentium chip, back in the early 1990s? Someone found a small
error in the chip, and news about it spread furiously fast on the Internet — so
fast that Intel couldn’t contain it and didn’t remedy it fast enough. That negative
buzz cost the company $475 million in write-offs — but it offered a great lesson
in what to do and what not to do when someone discovers a weakness in your
product or service.
Keep in mind the old adage that a happy customer may recommend your
product or service or store to someone else, but an unhappy customer will
definitely complain about you to at least three people. The power and speed
of the Internet have increased that nightmare scenario exponentially. Do your
best to keep your customers happy — no matter what.

Tips and Techniques on Generating Buzz
As I mention in previous sections, you don’t have to just sit around and pray
for good word of mouth or great buzz — you can actively work to promote it.
Check out some suggestions I gleaned from Richard Laermer, author of Full
Frontal PR: Building Buzz About Your Business, Your Product, or You, in the fol-
lowing sections.
Coining a great new phrase
One way to get people talking is to come up with a new expression associated
with your business. People love to be in the know and ahead of the curve, and
many people love things just because they’re new — and that includes lan-
guage. In fact, many great ad campaigns were successful because they (often
unwittingly) created a new expression that people started using in everyday
life and conversation. Think of the saying “Where’s the beef?” This expression
was first used in a Wendy’s commercial, where a gruff little old lady was liter-
ally looking for the meat in her hamburger, but the expression came to be
used in any situation where the substance of something was missing.
One way to coin a new phrase is to turn your business’s or product’s name
into a verb. For example, Richard Laermer uses the example of Google.com,
an Internet search engine you’re probably familiar with. People now talk
about “I googled it to find out more about it. . . .” So now, when someone
needs to look something up on the Internet, Google.com is probably one of
the first search engines to come to mind.
Companies used to hate this appropriation of their names. For example,
Kleenex and Xerox fought to prevent their brand names from becoming syn-
onymous with the product itself (in this case, face tissue and photocopying).
Now, however, many companies are delighted to have that “problem,”
because it means that consumers view their names as the brand leaders. If
your company or brand name becomes part of the popular lexicon, that’s a
great way to advertise your business!
Hiring beautiful people to 
promote your product
Another way to get people talking is to give them something interesting to
talk about. If your product or business isn’t already fabulous, try to attach it
to something that is. And if your business is already exciting, associate it with
something even more intriguing!

Chapter 17: Creating Buzz and Word-of-Mouth Advertising

For example, Vespas are little known in the United States, though these little
scooters are everywhere in Italy. Richard Laermer describes how Vespa
helped make inroads (pun intended) into the U.S. market by hiring gorgeous
models to ride around Los Angeles, stop in at various cafes and have a coffee
while chatting with other customers about their cool mini-motorbikes. The
models weren’t famous, but they were beautiful, and they attracted attention
to themselves first but then to the product they were promoting, and the
whole stunt generated buzz — in a city where that’s tough to do!
Taking advantage of celebrity 
endorsements
If you can get the attention of a celebrity — either purposely or serendipi-
tously, you should leverage that attention as much as possible.
Okay, you can’t solicit spontaneous celebrity mentions, but you can leverage
them if they happen on their own. For example, Richard Laermer cites how
Sandra Bullock became a one-woman marketing machine for Listerine
PocketPaks (those little tab-sized breath strips that were introduced in 2005)
when she talked about them nonstop at the Oscars in 2002.
Similarly, Rush Limbaugh created buzz for The Millionaire Next Door, a very
interesting book that was little known until Limbaugh mentioned it on his
radio show, which has an enormous listening audience. The book has since
sold more than 2 million copies, and it was on the New York Times bestseller
list for 3 years.
If I were working to promote either of the above products, you can bet your
last dollar I would do everything possible to maximize that exposure. For
example, I would have copies of the Oscar footage where Sandra Bullock
talked about the Listerine PocketPaks, and I’d send that video and quote her
in all future marketing for that product. And I’d get in touch with her to find
out whether she’d be willing to go further and become a spokeswoman for
the brand or whether I could use her endorsement in future ad campaigns.
Regarding Mr. Limbaugh, if I had been the publisher of that book, I’d have
immediately contacted him to get a written endorsement of the book, which I
would then feature on every future copy and edition of the book and all sub-
sequent marketing, advertising, and sales materials. You should look for the
same opportunities.
So how do you maximize on celebrity exposure? Here are a few things that I
would do:
 Get a copy of what the celebrity said about your product or business, or
request a written endorsement.
252
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

 Obtain permission from that celebrity (in writing, of course) to use his
comments in your future ad campaigns.
 Consider asking that celebrity to be your spokesperson.
Throwing a party
Generating buzz by throwing a big bash is considered a publicity party, and
publicity isn’t advertising, of course, but parties can generate word of mouth
as well as publicity in newspapers, magazines, and other media. The party
itself probably won’t be free (unless you can get friends and fans to provide
the space and the food and drink, and send out the invitations, which you
quite possibly can!). But even if you do have to incur some costs to throw a
party, it can be money very well spent because of the word of mouth it can
generate.
You can throw a party to announce a grand opening of your store, to intro-
duce a new product or invention, or to celebrate an anniversary, such as the
tenth anniversary of your being in business for yourself — or anything else
that’s new with your business. Of course, you should invite newspeople, from
all the local newspapers (your major city paper as well as smaller neighbor-
hood papers, as well as freebies around town), local magazines, and local TV
and radio personalities, but you also want to invite everyone you know who
you think can talk about your product or business in an interesting, exciting
way. If they have a great time at your party, they’re more likely to tell all their
friends, colleagues, neighbors, and acquaintances about it — especially if
you’ve done something unique at the party or given away something fabulous.
For example, one publicity party I attended for a book about a very success-
ful black entrepreneur generated lots of word of mouth. Why? Because the
hostess invited Coretta Scott King — and she came, with one of her sons!
That was exciting: She and her late husband, the Reverend Martin Luther
King, are legends in the world of civil rights, and many people at the party
welcomed this unique opportunity to meet her. Mrs. King’s presence at the
party got people talking, and it helped the book become a business bestseller
and sell more than 100,000 copies, which is terrific for a business book.
Hitting the streets
Another way to promote buzz is to take your product or service literally to
the streets: to pound pavements where people are out and about, walking
and driving. This method isn’t the same as outdoor advertising (covered in
Chapter 11); instead, it’s more about meeting and greeting potential customers.
253
Chapter 17: Creating Buzz and Word-of-Mouth Advertising

For example, Richard Laermer recommends doing such simple and low-budget
advertising as putting stickers on every lamppost to build awareness of your
brand. Here’s an example he offers in Full Frontal PR: When The New York
Times started its online service, it hired a small ad agency that gave out
paper spoons with the company’s Web site (www.nytoday.com) on them,
and when those people logged on, they could print out a coupon for a cheap
but yummy meal at Daily Soup, a popular café in midtown New York City.
That strategy generated buzz about the Web site.
Figuring out where to find your big mouths
In addition to finding the right type of big mouth (see the preceding section),
you need to know where best to reach him. Finding your market maven
requires creative thinking on your part, because you know best (or at least
you should!) where your customers are most readily found.
For example, Malcolm Gladwell offers insight on this, too, by way of a great
example. He writes how a nurse in San Diego wanted to make more black
women aware of and knowledgeable about diabetes and breast cancer. She
began in what she thought was the right place, by targeting black churches,
but she found that the women who stayed after services were already knowl-
edgeable, and the rest of the congregations just wanted to get home.
So she thought about finding a place where black women would have more
time and be more relaxed and therefore be more open to receiving informa-
tion, and she realized that the best place for her to generate word of mouth
was at the beauty salon. So she taught hairdressers to be her mavens, her big
mouths, and she generated the buzz she wanted in order to educate women
about these diseases and to encourage them to get mammograms and find
out even more about how they can protect themselves.
Creating a blog about your business
WOMMA (see the section “Getting the Terminology Straight” in this chapter)
also offers a Womnibus (another great name) that posts useful information on
the WOMMA Web site for people interested in word-of-mouth marketing trends.
WOMMA touts the Womnibus as the primary resource for advertisers wanting
to get involved with word-of-mouth strategies. One Womnibus described a
study conducted by the Pew research organization about the prevalence of
blogs (short for Web logs) as of mid-2006. Among the key findings:
 Eight percent of consumers (12 million U.S. adults) keep a blog, up from
7 percent in 2005.
 Thirty-nine percent of consumers (57 million U.S. adults) read blogs, an
increase from 27 percent in 2005.
254
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

Pew concludes that blogs have become one of the key media for word of
mouth. Maybe this strategy is something that could work for your business, if
your target market spends a lot of time on the Internet.
As new technology comes along, so will new ways to communicate with an
ever-widening circle of friends and acquaintances who can potentially be
influenced by individual ideas, recommendations, and suggestions on prod-
ucts, services, businesses, and stores. So, keep current on the technology
trends and jump at the chance of putting one to work for your business.

Leveraging Your Advertising with
Public Relations, Publicity,
Specialty Items, and Events
In This Chapter
 Working public relations like a pro
 Mastering publicity by writing an effective public release
 Using specialty advertising items and promotions to get your name out
I
n addition to the myriad ways you can advertise your business, you can
find other marketing activities that are closely related to advertising. This
chapter covers four of these options: public relations, publicity (especially
via press releases), specialty item advertising, and promotional events.
Before diving in, you should understand the difference between two of these
terms, which people often confuse. Although closely related, public relations
and publicity are two different things. Public relations (PR) is the ongoing
process of promoting yourself and talking yourself up. Publicity is the occa-
sional process of using a much bigger tool (usually in the form of media) to
promote yourself.
Here’s a simple analogy illustrating the difference between public relations
and publicity: If your business sponsors a Little League team for kids who live
near your store, that is public relations. You’re endearing yourself to the kids’
parents (the public to whom you’re trying to relate), who may, as a result,
become your customers. If, on the other hand, you send your local newspaper
a written story bragging about your Little League sponsorship in the hopes of
having it printed, that is publicity. You’re now blatantly (some would argue,
cleverly) trying to endear yourself to everyone who subscribes to the paper. A
public relations campaign may cost you money — uniforms and equipment for
your Little League team, for example — but publicity, for the most part, is free
(the media doesn’t charge you to publish or broadcast your story).
Of course, this chapter is only a quick primer into the ways and means of PR,
publicity, specialty items, and promotional events. If you’re really interested

in knowing more about these types of marketing, check out the Public
Relations For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric Yaverbaum, Ilise Benun, and
Richard Kirshenbaum (Wiley). To get the basics, though, read on!
Starting a Public Relations Campaign
From the sponsorship of a local Little League team to allowing local service
clubs the use of your store or conference room for their meetings, PR can
take many forms. Public relations is just that — relating to the public, which,
in this case, means your current and future customers. Your PR effort doesn’t
have to be grandiose and expensive — it can be modest and still be highly
effective. If you own a pet-supply store, you can offer free dog-training classes
or low-priced vaccination clinics (these offers could also be defined as pro-
motions). If you own a restaurant, you can offer your banquet room free of
charge to the local Toastmasters or Rotary Club (of course, you charge them
for the food and beverages). And regardless of your business, you can offer
free goods for charity auctions or buy ad space in the high school yearbook,
ticket books for worthwhile raffles, and so on.
One of my clients, a furniture store owner, donated a very expensive dining
room set to a local fundraising auction and, as a result of his generosity and
the ensuing publicity, he has been enjoying new cash customers from the
sponsoring club ever since.
The trick to PR is to do good works for the community while gaining at least a
subtle recognition for yourself and your business.
Unlike the immediacy of a press release, where you’re looking to get a story
published right away, PR is a continuing process just as your advertising
campaign is (or should be) a continuing process. Your PR campaign is an
integral part of your entire communications course of action and is no less
important than a blockbuster TV or radio commercial or a full-page ad in the
local daily. And, if yours is a small to mid-size retail or service business, a
solid PR effort in your community is doubly important. A well-planned PR
campaign keeps your name in front of your customers (and prospective cus-
tomers) even when you’re not actively advertising.
So how do you make friends and influence people; create understanding,
acceptance, and awareness of your business or product; and gain a favorable
response from your marketplace? As with all aspects of advertising, know what
messages you want to communicate (see Chapter 4 for more details on forming
your message). Think about what your various audiences need to know about
your product or service. What is it that makes what you sell better than, or dif-
ferent from, anything else consumers can get elsewhere? Are there audiences
who should know about your community involvement, your environmental
record, your particular expertise that adds value to your sell? Should people
know about the comprehensiveness of your offer, key endorsements you have
258
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

received, the credibility of your investors, the partnerships you’ve formed, or
the promotional tie-ins you provide with other organizations?
Your messages should directly answer the question: “Why should anyone
care about what you offer?” When you know what you want to communicate
through your PR, how do you go about delivering that message? You can use
many different vehicles for communicating with the audiences you want to
reach. Here’s a list of potential communications vehicles:
 Publicity or press releases targeted to mass, trade, or community media
(see the next section on publicity for more information)
 Article reprints of publicity you’ve received from various media, which
you then mail to specific lists
 Professional-quality photography to accompany your press releases
 Volunteer participation in community and charitable organizations or
foundations
 Scholarships you’ve awarded and that carry your name
 Seminars, speeches, and lectures you give to various groups
 Web site and Internet postings of publicity you’ve received
 Contests you sponsor that carry your name
 Newsletters you write and send out on a regular basis
 Donations of products or services to community causes, events, 
and clubs
Understanding How Publicity 
Can Bring Customers
Apart from the single article or broadcast segment you may notice and envy,
what you may not realize are the many benefits that an organized and contin-
uing publicity effort adds to your other advertising endeavors. If you’re using
paid advertising, articles in which you or your company appear help infuse
your campaign with credibility and detail. Plus, publicity adds reach and fre-
quency to your message that you may not otherwise be able to afford.
Most people understand the power of favorable news coverage, whether it’s
The Wall Street Journal, the local daily, Time magazine, local radio or TV, an
industry trade journal, or a community weekly paper. Restaurants receiving
positive media coverage are swamped with phone calls for reservations.
Companies get a flood of orders for their well-reviewed widgets. Designers
become “hot.” New respect is derived from customers, competitors, family,
and friends.

Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

The publicity blitz I conceived to put the Pet Rock on the tip of everyone’s
tongue (see the nearby sidebar) was accomplished at absolutely no cost. I
never spent a dime to advertise the product, and the national and interna-
tional publicity was free. I must admit that I had the advantage over other
inventors: I had an advertising and public relations background and knew the
various steps to take to obtain free publicity. But you’re in luck! I’m sharing
these insights with you in this section.
Writing an effective press release
The backbone of publicity is the press release, which is simply a news story
written by someone other than the editors and reporters of the media to
whom that person submits the release for publication. It is, when written
properly, a valuable tool for businesspeople, because it can generate what
amounts to free advertising. And when your local paper prints your press
release, it becomes an endorsement of sorts by that publication.
Writing an effective release is harder than it looks, so in the sections that
follow, I walk you through each step — from choosing an appropriate topic
that news media may be interested in, to organizing the information you’re
260
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 
The Pet Rock: A publicity phenomenon
The Pet Rock was quickly transformed from a
novelty gift with an uncertain future into an
international retail phenomenon, thanks to the
incredible power of publicity. I was unable to
afford a huge advertising budget, so I wrote a
publicity story and sent it, along with photos of
its inventor (me), the product, and its packaging,
to major weekly news magazines. On November
10, 1975, a half-page publicity story about the
Pet Rock and a photo of me were featured in
Newsweek.
Maybe it was a slow news day. Or perhaps the
tongue-in-cheek qualities of both the product
and the publicity story attracted the editors’
attention. Whatever the reason, Newsweek
printed my story and gave the item media cred-
ibility — in my opinion, the Pet Rock was more
of a media event than a sales event. Although
we sold (literally and figuratively) tons of them,
the media attention generated by the product
far outweighed the sales produced. During its
five-month retailing life span (yep, that’s all it
had), the Pet Rock was referenced in nearly
every daily newspaper in the country, most
major magazines, all network national news
programs, The Tonight Show and other late-
night talk shows, most radio talk shows, and
international media, such as the BBC. I was per-
sonally interviewed hundreds of times.
The Pet Rock generated multimillions of dollars
of free publicity that continues to this day. More
than 25 years later, I am still contacted by major
media to comment on new novelty items. The
Pet Rock has become a part of the lexicon, a
permanent piece of Americana. The moral of
the story: Don’t doubt the influence of publicity.
Use it to your advantage, and you shall prosper.

providing in ensure that you cover everything the media will want to know
and in a format they’re familiar with and can use.
You may also consider writing a simpler fact sheet, which is a brief description
of your business, what you do, where you’re located, how to contact you, and
other basic information. The fact sheet isn’t a news story; instead, it simply
answers the who, what, where, when, how, and why of what your business does.
Choosing a newsworthy topic
Press releases have one purpose: to get you free publicity (a form of advertis-
ing) by informing the media that your company has done, or will do, some-
thing newsworthy. Here are just a few of the subjects you could use as a basis
for a press release:
 A purchase of a competitor’s business or a merger
 A community project your company has sponsored
 An industry award won by you or one of your employees
 The introduction of a new product or service
 A new location or the addition of a branch office
 A highly successful year or quarter
 A change in business policy, a new affiliation, or a significant new hire
The bottom line is to send news that may be of interest to a broad audience.
To get the best result, however, keep in mind that your press release should
describe something that can really intrigue readers. In fact, some publicists
say the guiding principle for publicity should be a story where “Man Bites
Dog” — in other words, an unusual or unexpected twist. (And keep in mind
the opposite — if your story is “Dog Bites Man,” who cares?)
Reporters and editors all have the same problem: They must fill their pages 
or their broadcast news airtime with interesting stories each and every day.
For this reason, they welcome the receipt of a well-written, attention-grabbing
press release from time to time. It helps them do their jobs. They may not print
the story verbatim — instead, they may use your press release as a basis for a
story they write themselves, after interviewing you for more information. But
newspapers always print stories they find worthwhile. Getting good ink isn’t
hard, as long as your subject matter is of interest.
Don’t send out a press release unless you have something important to say.
Make sure the story is interesting, relevant, possibly amusing, always news-
worthy, and, above all, not frivolous or boring in its content. You can make an
editor very crabby with a story about the roof of your store leaking during a
recent rainstorm. If, on the other hand, the roof of your store caved in but
you saved dozens of shoppers from injury, you’re going to get all the free
publicity you can possibly handle.
261
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

Organizing the information in your press release
When you have something interesting to say and you want to submit a press
release, you need to write the release in the form that editors and reporters
are used to seeing. The standard press release format is a fairly structured
one, written in the journalistic style (a narrative style in which the most
important facts come first) and contain the five Ws: who, what, when, where,
and why. The reader of a press release should be able to grasp all the neces-
sary facts after reading only the first paragraph.
Your release should include the following information, in this order:
 The sending company’s name, address, phone number, fax number,
e-mail address, and contact person (that’s you).
 The date of submission and the instructions as to when the story is to
be released to the public — usually “For immediate release.”
 The words “Press Release” — this way the editors know what this story is.
 A headline: a straightforward, one-line summary of the story. Although
some people feel that including a headline on a press release is an insult
to the editor of the publication (who may want to write his own head-
line), I usually add a headline anyway to attract the editor’s attention
and to make the story easily understood.
 An introductory paragraph: a slightly more-detailed summary of the
story.
262
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 
What editors and reporters 
look for in a press release
I asked a columnist for the San Jose Mercury
News what he looks for in a press release —
why he prints one story and discards another.
His response was succinct: “What’s a good
press release? Brief, to the point, and promising
information no one else has.” He then said, “If I
were to offer one suggestion to people sending
out press releases, it would be to first read the
publication the release is going to and to read
the writings of the editor or reporter to whom
the release is being sent. That, more than any-
thing else, will increase your chances of being
published.”
Remember: Sending out a press release isn’t a
guarantee that you’ll ever see it in print. You may
think your story is newsworthy, but the editor
may not. Editors only print news that can inter-
est their readers. And they know what their
readers want. Your story could also be killed
because you had the unfortunate timing of
sending it in just when a major news story
erupted. Because space (whether print or
broadcast) is finite, your story could get bumped
in favor of more important news. Sometimes, it’s
the luck of the draw.

 The bulk of the story containing straightforward, pertinent information,
written with the copious use of quotes. Using quotes allows you to
impart information that then appears to have been gleaned by a
reporter from an actual interview of the person “speaking.”
 Fluff: information of some interest, but not directly relevant to the story.
 A photo, drawing, chart, or other graphic element directly related to the
story, along with a suggested caption written by you.
 The end of the story should be clearly marked with # # #.
In addition to the press release, a full media kit could include some or all of
the following information:
 A Q&A simulated interview: Providing an interview in this format
would call attention to some of the key points you want to make about
your business. Broadcast news media may then use this format as the
basis for an actual interview with you, and print media may simply
reprint it in their publications.
 A detailed bio of you or other key people who founded or run your
business: This biography should be no more than one page, but that
should be more than enough for you to highlight what you’re most suc-
cessful at or experienced in doing! It’s okay to brag a little, as long as
you can back it up!
 Endorsements or testimonials from satisfied customers or clients: You
may have collected these over the years, if you’ve gotten them in writ-
ing, or you can contact some of your best customers and ask them to
provide you with one now.
Make sure you have your clients’ permission, though, to include these
comments in your press materials — you don’t want to surprise anyone
who wouldn’t expect to see his name in print or on the air!
 Articles previously published by or about you in other publications: If
you or your business have already been profiled in some magazine or
newspaper, include copies of those. Ideally, they should be glossy repro-
ductions of the actual article, with the publication’s masthead. If you
don’t have that, though, a simple black-and-white photocopy is fine, but
try not to use printouts from the Web: They don’t have the same note of
authenticity — even though they’re real — as a reprint does.
Getting the story to the right media
You can either deliver, mail, or e-mail your press release directly to your local
publication. Or if you’re eager to get the story published by multiple publica-
tions or broadcasters (if the story has national implications, for instance),
you can use a professional service such as the Business Wire.
263
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

Business Wire (www.businesswire.com) is a service that electronically dis-
seminates your story and photos to a wide variety of national and interna-
tional media. You choose the list of recipients (specific editors for magazines,
radio or television stations, daily newspapers, or all the above), and you pay
for the service based on the scope of your media choices. You may also send
your press release to PRWeb online (www.prweb.com), where many people
post press releases these days.
You may also consider hiring your own PR firm or freelance publicist, if you
decide that doing it yourself is too much for you to take on, in addition to all
the other aspects of running your business. By doing a little research, you
can find professional help that matches up with your business’s publicity and
financial needs.
The worst thing you can do with your press release is send it to a post office
box or general street address or to the editor-in-chief. Your release will get
lost in a huge pile of daily mail received by the publication, and it may never
reach the proper editor or reporter. Unfortunately, the right person for the
right story varies at each publication or broadcast station. It could be the
news director, news editor, city editor, executive editor, or senior editor.
Take the time to call or write the publications and ask who should be
addressed for a particular story. Get a name, title, and routing address for
this person. Your release has a much better chance of seeing print if you
invest this small amount of effort.
The secret to getting a reporter’s attention for your story is salesmanship. You
must pursue your target market, in this case the media, with a nicely pack-
aged product (meaning a well-written story or provocative story outline). And
your product must be something that the reporter needs or desires, meaning
a story about a subject he covers that can be resold to the editor or producer.
Like all sales efforts, you need to sell reporters on you, on your product, on
your story, and on why they and their audience should care. Tell them how
your story adds to any particular point of public discussion or marketplace
need. The sell must be timely or must be cultivated over time (serving that
reporter as a source of tips and information). The reporter must trust you and
be interested in what you have to say.
Unless you see the story as having very broad implications and want to get
as much news coverage as possible, limit the number of publications you
send it to. If the information is highly technical and specific to your own
trade, send it to journals and trade publications within your industry. If the
release is more general (you’re introducing a new product or you’re involved
in a community project, for example), send it to your trade journals, plus all
area newspapers, magazines, broadcast stations, and publications.
264
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

Editors receive piles of press releases each week. They are all read and con-
sidered, but they are not all published. Every publication has its own ideas as
to what constitutes news. Some releases may result in a phone call, an inter-
view, and a full write-up; others may get only a line or two of copy. If you’ve
sent along a photo, you may see the story but no picture, or vice versa. Or,
sadly, none of the above may happen. Don’t be too discouraged if your story
never gets ink. Try again with another story at some future date.
If you don’t see your story printed within a reasonable amount of time, you
can call the editor to whom you sent the story to innocently ask whether she
received it. Keep in mind, though, that your release probably arrived as part
of a huge pile of mail, so don’t get all bent out of shape because the editor
doesn’t know what you’re talking about. Calling alerts the editor that your
story is somewhere on her desk and will likely get her to at least look at it.
Remember to be respectful, not confrontational. Don’t nag or pester or stalk
the media, but it’s okay to follow up politely.
If a reporter does cover your business in response to your press release, be
sure to follow up promptly with a thank-you note! Reporters depend on
experts in a variety of businesses, and if they know they can count on you for
useful information, that you’re professional and easy to talk to, and that
you’ll get back to them quickly when they need information, they’ll add you
to their calling list, and you become one of their go-to sources — and you’ll
start to see your name in print or on air more often!
265
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising
Dealing with the news media
When you have a story, keep it simple, clear,
brief, and to the point. Here are some tips for
dealing with the news media:
 Target media representatives covering
your area of business. Send notes compli-
menting them about stories they do. Call or
write and let them know that you could be a
good resource on specific topics. Alert
them to things you may know about.
 Provide good photography whenever pos-
sible. Use the photography to help tell your
story.
 Develop a point of view. To the extent 
possible, make your perspective colorful,
entertaining, provocative, confident, and
visionary.
Remember: If you know how to work with the
news media effectively, you can get all kinds of
free publicity for your business — and publicity
is a great form of advertising.

Advertising on Specialty Items
Despite all the critical things consumers often say about advertising, they’re
increasingly willing to be walking billboards for various brands as they don
all sorts of promotional wearables and display everything from logo-covered
coffee mugs to candy jars on their desks. In the world of advertising, these
free gifts are called specialty advertising (which is stuff on which you print
your company logo and slogan) and premium items (which are bonus gifts
intended to entice you to buy the regularly priced item in order to get the
“free” gift that comes with it, such as the toys and goodies your kids get when
you buy a kid’s meal at a fast-food emporium). Specialty advertising is often
the only advertising many small businesses do.
For better or worse, specialty advertising items are everywhere. Here are just
a few of the many specialty advertising and premium items you’re probably
very familiar with: baseball caps, t-shirts, golfing jackets, sweatshirts, umbrel-
las, letter openers, stadium blankets, bumper stickers, calculators, calendars,
and coffee mugs, to name a few. Figure 18-1 shows examples of the various
types of “freebies” often made available to customers. All of these items are
adorned with company logos, graciously received, and passed along by us to
friends, clients, or office neighbors who don’t mind parading around wearing
or displaying advertising.
In the following sections, I tell you why these items are good ways to adver-
tise your business, how to select the right item for your business, and how
best to include information about your business on a specialty item.

Recognizing the advantages 
of specialty advertising
If you plan carefully and select a truly useful specialty advertising item to
include in a promotion, an item with intrinsic or decorative value that your
customers are glad to receive and certain to use, this form of advertising is
worth including in your overall campaign. In the following sections, I cover a
few good reasons to add quality premiums to your media mix.
Specialty items are relatively inexpensive
If you’re advertising on a budget, then specialty advertising items may be just
the thing to get your name before the buying public. For the most part, spe-
cialty items can be very affordable. For example, you can print your logo
onto a fairly good ballpoint pen for 50 cents apiece. A plastic clip that reseals
opened potato chip bags, a rubber circle that helps open jars, a razor-blade
letter opener — people may use all of these items every day, and none of
them costs more than a dollar a piece. If you print your logo on them and
give them out, the recipients will be continually reminded of your business.
You can pay thousands of dollars for a television package and hope that a few
of your spots run in good viewing times — and that viewers are watching,
instead of getting a snack when your spots run. But for just a few bucks
apiece (or less), you can get a whole pile of specialty items printed with your
logo, ready to advertise your company on a long-term basis (provided that
you select an item people actually want).
A radio station once gave me a really nifty pocket calculator that folds away
and takes up no room at all on my desk. I use this item each and every day.
And when I touch the little button that unfolds it, I can’t help but see the sta-
tion’s logo, and I am reminded of who gave it to me. This specialty advertising
item — an item I actually use on a daily basis — has a purpose. You want to be
sure to find a premium that people can enjoy and use for years to come —
otherwise, you’re just wasting your money.
Specialty items are stand-alone ads
Specialty advertising products are one of the few advertising vehicles that
can stand alone. Most other types of advertising need to be supported with
more advertising. For instance, you need to buy advertising on mass media 
in order to direct people to your Web site. But a promotional item, whether
mailed to your customer list or handed out at your place of business, is pretty
much self-sufficient in getting your advertising message across to your 
customers.
267
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

You can imprint anything
In addition to t-shirts, coffee mugs, and key chains, you can find companies
that can laser-etch your logo onto the shells of live lobsters so you can send
them to clients you really want to impress. You can have your logo engraved
onto solid-gold putters for golfers you desperately want to do business with.
A bakery in my area will inkjet (using edible inks) your logo, four-color photo,
or whatever onto delicious cakes, which they will then deliver to your clients.
And I used a local microbrewery to make a batch of beer with my own private
label, packed the bottles in wooden cases that were laser-etched with my
logo, and sent the brews to clients as holiday gifts. It was a big hit.
If you can look beyond the obvious promotional items, the ones everyone
sends out, then you can truly make an impression.
Multiple impressions are a good thing
When I measure the effectiveness of radio or television buys, I do so in 
terms of gross impressions (the number of audience members delivered by a
media schedule without regard to duplication) and cost per thousand (the
cost per 1,000 people or households delivered by a media schedule). With
specialty items, using these methods of measurement is impossible, because
specialty items — at least the ones that are useful and have actual value to
the recipient — have the advantage of scoring repeated impressions without
repeated costs. You buy it once, and it sits on a customer’s desk forever.
One Christmas, a radio station sent me beautiful note cards and envelopes
with my name richly embossed on top-quality paper. Every time I send a
note, I’m reminded of that station — which had the good taste to send me
something I’m proud to use. Multiple impressions are a very good thing!
Premiums reinforce your other media efforts
Burger King, McDonald’s, and other fast-food giants use premiums to reinforce
their mass media efforts, so why shouldn’t you? When Burger King gives away
an item tied to a movie promotion (like Open Season, the animated film comedy
where Boog the bear moves from his home in a suburban garage to the real
world of the forest), it calls attention to its giveaway items in its TV and radio
advertising, saying something like, “Eight toys for the taking: one toy in every
kids meal while supplies last.” Likewise, the premium items themselves call
attention to BK’s broadcast efforts — in this case, the toys were plastic repli-
cas of characters in the movie: a spinning Boog the Bear, a bucking Elliot the
deer, a hopping McSquizzy the squirrel, or a chopping Reilly the beaver.
Every form of media reinforces every other form of media, thereby making
the entire promotion just that much more effective.
If you’re giving away a premium or a specialty item with your logo affixed, by
all means tell people about it in your other advertising: “Come in today,
browse our new selection of fine kitchen cabinets, and be sure to ask for your
very own laser-etched lobster.” This cross-referencing will go a long way in
stretching your advertising dollars.

Premiums are user-friendly
Advertising, by its very nature, is designed to be intrusive. If it weren’t intru-
sive, how would anyone notice it? Specialty advertising items, on the other
hand, aren’t so intrusive that they irritate people — especially items with a
purpose. People actually want and appreciate advertising specialties that
have utilitarian, intrinsic, or decorative value. What they don’t want are com-
mercials interrupting their favorite TV shows.
Selecting specialty items with a purpose
Coffee mugs, key chains, baseball caps, and t-shirts are the mainstays of spe-
cialty advertising, but literally thousands of items are out there, onto which
your logo or ad slogan can be printed or etched. The trick is to select an item
that has real appeal to the consumer; something unusual and interesting;
something that will be gratefully accepted and actually used.
In general, it’s a good idea to select specialty items that have relevance to
your product, service, or business and your target audience. For example, a
yardstick or tape measure is relevant to a lumberyard; an accountant may give
clients a calculator just as a restaurant may give coffee mugs. I know of an auto
service shop that gives each regular customer an air pressure gauge, which not
only keeps the shop’s name in the car owner’s glove box but also sends a clear
message that this shop wants to help its customers take care of their cars.
Also, one trend in specialty items is to give gifts that aren’t imprinted or are
discreetly imprinted. Clients are more likely to use a gift that doesn’t adver-
tise your name, and they will still be likely to remember who gave it to them.
Finally, consider gift-wrapping your items. For example, if you’re giving out a
pen, invest in a nice one (around $4.00), and go the extra step of buying the
twenty-five-cent box. Clients greatly overestimate the value of something as
simple as a pen: They appreciate it because it’s useful. Similarly, pulling an
ordinary golf shirt out of a big carton isn’t nearly as impressive, exciting, or
appreciated as receiving a gift-wrapped box with a shirt that ideally has your
name embroidered on it and is the correct size. Bottom line: Going the extra
mile can pay off.
Twenty years ago I received a candy jar with a wooden lid on which a radio
station’s call letters were etched. It’s a tasteful item (in more ways than one),
and it still sits, two decades later, on the coffee table in my office, continually
filled with a fresh supply of M&M’s. The candy jar was a specialty item with a
purpose. Over the years, I have tossed out hundreds of caps, t-shirts, and
bumper stickers, but I still keep the candy jar.
More than 250,000 premium items and specialty advertising items are on the
market today, just waiting for your logo. Look for something that you would
be proud to give away and your customers would be happy to receive. In just
269
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

a quick glance around my office, I see specialty items of every size and shape.
Here are my favorites:
 A very utilitarian folding calculator
 A candy jar
 Embossed personal stationery and note cards
 A desktop business card holder
 A clever, razor-blade letter opener
I use these items many times throughout the day. All the other stuff — mugs,
golfing jackets, baseball caps, magnetic vinyl bumper stickers, key chains, ball-
point pens, and other things — are still lying around the office only because no
one has bothered to throw them out. The neat stuff gets used. The not-so-neat
stuff just takes up space — and wastes your valuable advertising dollars.
If you thoughtfully select your specialty advertising items, you can measure
their effectiveness in terms of frequency just as you would a radio or TV com-
mercial. Why? Because if the item is used daily, perhaps multiple times every
day, then each time the item is used you have made another impression with
the same advertising message. That principle is called frequency.
However, to attain frequency, you must first select an item that has either a
utilitarian or a decorative value and can, therefore, be used or displayed by
the recipient. You’re not going to get a lot of mileage out of some cheapo 
t-shirt that’s relegated to the bottom of a dresser drawer (especially if it’s a
one-size-fits-all — it usually doesn’t). But you can win friends and influence
people with a gift item that solves a problem or fills a need. When my barber
gave me a logo-imprinted rubber pad that aids in opening sticky jar lids, I
thought he was nuts and had wasted his money. But that was only until I used
it once and found out that this goofy item actually works! Hard-to-open jars
are no longer a problem (especially important for a guy who loves pickles). It
turned out to be a specialty item with legs — its effectiveness is, therefore,
measurable on a frequency basis.
If you want to get an overview of the incredible array of specialty advertising
items that are available, as well as some great promotional ideas and insights,
visit the Advertising Specialty Institute Web site at www.promomart.com.
You can also check your local Yellow Pages to find specialty advertising sales-
people in your area.
Some specialty advertising items can be quite effective. However, choose
your items as though you were picking out something for yourself. Ask your-
self: “Would I actually use this thing? Would I be grateful to receive it?” If you
answer yes, incorporate it into your overall advertising scheme.
270
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

Keep the copy simple on a specialty item
Keep in mind that a promotional product isn’t an information source — it’s
an advertisement. Its job is to capture people’s attention and help them
remember you. If the product does its job, you often have no need to include
additional information. The phone call or e-mail you’ll likely receive provides
that opportunity. Keep your copy brief and to the point, toss in some selling
points or a slogan, and let it go at that. Don’t try to include everything you do
or a list of your entire store inventory. Stick to the main selling proposition. A
logo, phone number, Web site address, and perhaps your company slogan are
more than enough information to include on a specialty advertising item. For
more information on how to write simple, effective copy, check out Chapter
5. In general, when you’re delivering your message, just remember to KISS:
Keep it simple, stupid!
Generating Traffic: Promotional Events
Sometimes, getting the world to beat a path to your door requires that you
offer a little bribery — an incentive to get the world to even consider your
door, let alone beat a path to it. Promotions are events designed to generate
traffic, to get lots of people together in one place at one time in order to do a
sales job on them. Promotions and events are a good way to call attention to
yourself, your business, your current sale, your new inventory, or your
expanded showrooms. They’re also a great way to meet prospective cus-
tomers face to face. But these advertising forms can add to your bottom line
only if you’re careful about what you participate in and objective as to
whether the promotion or event is truly relevant to your business.
271
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising
T-shirt hysteria
It never ceases to amaze me what people
endure in order to get a free t-shirt. The San
Jose Mercury News,my area’s major daily news-
paper, sponsors a charity-based 10K race pro-
motion each year and gets 10,000 runners, walk-
ers, strollers, saunterers, and staggerers —
many of whom are only there to get the free 
t-shirt (which isn’t really free because there is
a $10 entry fee). The radio and TV stations in the
Bay Area trot out a nearly infinite variety of pro-
motions each year to attract new listeners and
viewers for the stations and new customers for
the advertisers, who are willing to pony up extra
dollars to buy space at the event and the adver-
tising to tell people about it. What do the folks
who attend these promotions receive for their
trouble? Yep, you guessed it. Free t-shirts — oh,
maybe water bottles, almost certainly CDs spe-
cific to that station’s formatting, and perhaps a
flimsy painter’s cap with a cheesy logo, but
always a t-shirt!

Radio stations are famous for devising promotions to create value-added ben-
efits for their advertisers and for selling sponsorships designed solely to get
more income from their advertisers. Some are good, and some are simply
awful. So what makes a good promotion, how do you know it’s good, and
should you participate? Should you do your own promotion, and will it actu-
ally bring customers through your door? I explore these questions and others
in this section while trying to steer you into well-conceived promotions and
events that stand a good chance of succeeding.
Radio: The promotions king
When you buy your radio advertising, you have two kinds of promotions that
you can tie in with your radio buy: Station promos and sales-drive promos. In
the following sections, I explain what these promos are and show you how to
use them to your business’s advantage.
Getting your goods out: Station promos
A station promotion is one invented by the station and is often produced on a
regular basis. The station then solicits advertisers to provide goods and ser-
vices to fold into the promotion.
For example, one of the radio stations in my area has a promotion called “The
Coffee Break.” This promotion is designed to encourage people to listen to
the station while they’re at work. Regular listeners are asked to fax to the
radio station their names, the names of their companies, the number of
employees, and so on. Then this information is put into a hopper and drawn
at random each day or week. The winning company gets a visit from mem-
bers of the station’s promotions department and members of the on-air staff,
who bring along gourmet coffee provided by a coffee shop that advertises on
the station, donuts or bagels provided by a bakery that advertises on the sta-
tion, flower arrangements contributed by a florist that advertises on the sta-
tion, and so forth. In return, each of the station advertisers who donate
goods to the coffee break (the coffee shop, the bakery, and the florist) get
multiple free mentions throughout their paid broadcast schedules.
If you’re an advertiser and have something radio stations need to produce a
station promotion, chances are they’ll come to you. In case they don’t, a good
time to get involved is when you buy your media schedule. Ask the sales rep
what promotions are available to you as value-added advertising (extra stuff,
generally free) to help boost your paid media buy. You can’t find a radio sta-
tion in the known universe that doesn’t produce a multitude of promotions
on a regular basis, and what you’re selling can probably fit nicely into at least
one of them. If you don’t have a food or beverage operation, not to worry.
The stations also need a variety of goods and services to use as prizes.
272
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

Getting the exclusive: Sales-driven promos
Sales-driven promotions are advertiser-specific — they’re invented for the
advertiser and are exclusive to that advertiser. Sales-driven promos are always
sold in conjunction with a media buy. A surprising number of large-budget
radio advertisers won’t even buy a station unless the station develops and
includes an exclusive promotion at no extra charge.
So how does a sales-driven promo work? Imagine that you own a kitchen store,
and you want to build a promotion around a celebrity chef doing demonstra-
tion cooking in your store. You can simply give this information to the station
sales rep, who conferences with his promotions department and comes back
with multiple ideas. Your rep may ask you to provide some merchandise for
prizes, make your store or business available on a certain day, contract for a
noncancelable media buy, and pay a modest talent fee to any on-air personali-
ties who may show up. The station may have on-air call-in contests in which
its listeners can win a cookbook autographed by your featured chef, or dinner
and wine for two at the chef’s restaurant. And for your store, it puts forward
everything from rolling-pin tossing to pancake races to pie-eating contests.
273
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising
Radio station remotes: They still work
Many station promotions are tied to live
remotes, which bring on-air personalities 
(disc jockeys) to your location. In addition to
broadcasting their shows from the remote 
location, the DJs bring along all kinds of logo-
emblazoned specialty items — t-shirts, bumper
stickers, coffee mugs, movie tickets — to give
away to the lucky people who show up for these
events.
These live-remote promotions are usually
offered to advertisers as part of their media buy.
They’re called value-added, and they’re usually
free. Because you’re going to have to do a lot 
of advertising anyway to get people to your
location, why not throw a remote into the mix
and give listeners an added reason to visit 
your store? The only additional out-of-pocket
expense is a modest talent fee for the on-air
personality, which makes these promos an 
inexpensive way to stretch an ad budget and to
publicize a new location, new inventory, new
restaurant, the latest model cars, or anything
else you can think of. In addition to the 60-
second spots you buy, you also receive a multi-
tude of 10-second promotional announcements
inviting listeners to your store on such and such
a date where they can meet, live and in person,
that wacky morning guy.
The beauty of a live remote is that you, the
advertiser, don’t have to do anything to make it
happen (other than make some merchandise
available as giveaways). The station does all the
work. Your broadcast commercials will, of
course, talk about what you’re trying to sell
during the promotion, but the 10-second
announcements that the station throws into the
pot drive the traffic to your store on the
appointed day and time. And employees of the
station’s promotions department are there to
make sure everything runs smoothly.

In addition to your paid media schedule, you get a large number of on-air
mentions (10- or 15-second announcements specific to your promotion) for a
couple weeks leading up to the event, and, hopefully, a bunch of traffic to
your business at the appointed date and time. Your problem is to sift through
all their suggestions to find the ones you can live with. Radio station promo-
tions directors really get into this stuff — they’re your best source for ideas.
Not every station promotion brings in hundreds of new customers, so don’t
set your expectations too high. One of my clients seems satisfied if a promo-
tion brings out a few dozen new faces. Remember: The promotion needs to
be relevant and interesting to the station’s listeners. In other words, don’t do
a promotion for an antique furniture store on a station with a teenage audi-
ence. If a promotion fails miserably, you may tend to blame the station, not
the fact that what you’re selling isn’t compatible with its listener’s tastes —
but there’s more to it than that. If a promotion fails, you may want to recon-
sider your media buy on that particular station, because if its listeners won’t
even come out to your location for free stuff, how can you expect them to
respond positively to the selling message in your 60-second spots?

A promotion so successful, it saved the business
I was once given a make-or-break advertising
budget by an underperforming local micro-
brewery and restaurant whose owners had
decided to take one more shot at success
before closing their doors forever. Accepting
the challenge was both daunting and invigorat-
ing. The target market was young adults, and
the brewery/restaurant had been wasting a lot
of advertising dollars in newspapers, an adver-
tising vehicle not famously efficient in reaching
yuppies. I chose to spend every last dime of
their budget on an all-or-nothing radio blitz,
selecting stations that had good ratings in the
adults 18 to 34 demographic.
One radio station came back to me with a “Beer
and Burger” lunchtime promotion. The idea was
that customers could come in on a certain day
and have a great lunch (a giant cheeseburger,
fries, and a brewsky) for just five bucks. The
promotion was, of course, tied to a station live
remote, which would feature its “morning man”
and his sidekick — two guys who were very
well known in the market — broadcasting live
from the brewpub. The promo would also fea-
ture the ubiquitous station specialty advertising
items for the people who came and a drawing
for a $500 bar and restaurant credit. The cost of
the advertising schedule covered everything.
The big day came, the doors opened at 11:00
a.m., and we had to step quickly back to avoid
getting trampled. It was a restaurant owner’s
dream come true. Hundreds of station listeners
stampeded through the door until it was stand-
ing room only and a two-hour wait for $5 worth
of burgers and beer. The promotion had every-
thing going for it — discounted food, free prizes,
cheap beer, a famous disc jockey, and a great
place in which to eat and drink. The restaurant
was “discovered” by hundreds of new cus-
tomers (many of whom stayed all that day to sip
more beers and became long-time regular cus-
tomers), was able to remain open, eventually
prospered, and, when it was back on its feet,
fired me because it no longer needed my ser-
vices! Go figure.

Other promotional opportunities
Radio station promotions aren’t the only way you can go. You can come up
with your own unique promotion as well. Many other media forms lend them-
selves to successful promos. Here are just a few promotional ideas:
 In-store counter displays: You can have your customers register to win
a contest by having a drawing. Or set up a buy-one-get-one-free offer.
 Direct mail: Send your customers coupons as a way to get them into
your store. Or mail them a card that they return to register to win a con-
test. Send out open-house invitations to get them into the store. (See
Chapter 10 for more on direct mail.)
 Newspaper: As part of your newspaper ad, you can provide coupons as
promotions to get people into your store. You can tell readers to present
the ad for half off their purchase or offer coloring contests for kids,
which is sure to get their parents into your store.
 Printed flyers: You can have flyers printed, and then place them on
parked cars, telling people to bring the flyer in for a discount or adver-
tising a one-day-only sale or a parking-lot sale. Chapter 10 gives you
details on how to do this effectively.
 Statement stuffers: When you send out your monthly statement to your
customers, you can put an ad in with the statement, offering loyal cus-
tomer discounts, coupons, or buy-two-get-one-free offers.
When you’re trying to decide which kind of promotional materials to use,
think about items of which you’ve been on the receiving end. Have you ever
received a promotional piece that not only caught your attention, but com-
pelled you to respond? What was it about that piece that cut through all the
advertising clutter and struck a nerve? Was it the design, the offer, an impos-
sible-to-ignore deal, a clever attachment, or a promise of something free?
Chances are, if something works well in grabbing your attention, it can grab
your customers’ attention as well. Promotional ideas are limited only by your
own imagination. I’m sure you can come up with some great ones.
Participating in Sponsored Events
Sponsored events — events that are devised and produced with commercial-
ism and financial gain foremost in mind — are available in many forms. A few
examples of sponsored events include the following:
 Tech fairs: Recruiting fairs at which high-tech companies hope to meet
future employees.
 Home-improvement fairs: Here, homeowners can find the very latest
decorating ideas for their houses.
275
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

 Campus fairs: Colleges and universities use these fairs to show off their
erudite wares to prospective students.
 Trade shows: A trade show is usually an annual event for a particular
industry to show off new products to its customers. An infinite variety of
trade shows are just waiting for your business’s participation.
 And many more: You can find a plethora of chili cook-offs, jazz festivals,
bluegrass festivals, arts and crafts fairs — you name it, it’s out there.
The types of events you participate in are plentiful, but your involvement is
what counts. You can participate in a sponsored event in two ways:
 Sponsor an event. You have a myriad of ways to sponsor an event —
from contributing financially to an established event in your area to
organizing an event on your own (and many in between). Sponsoring an
event is a great way for you to get your business’s name mentioned in
various ad mediums and to boost your business’s reputation.
If you’re interested in being involved in an event at this level (and
because I can’t cover all the splendid details in one tiny section of this
book), I suggest that you check out Meeting & Event Planning For
Dummies by Susan Friedmann (Wiley).
 Set up a booth. You can pay for and provide staff for an on-site booth at
the event and hope that all the expense and work involved result in
some added exposure and new business.
While both of these options are worth considering, I focus on the second —
setting up a booth — because you can transfer the information you find in
the following sections to any type of event. So keep reading to determine
whether this advertising method is right for your business and how you can
pull it off.
Determining whether you 
can staff the event
Whether you can participate may come down to logistics — do you have
(and can you spare) the manpower? Ask yourself the following questions
before committing yourself or your staff to an event:
 Can you take time away from your business to staff your own booth, par-
ticularly if the event runs multiple days?
 Do you have trustworthy employees who can represent you at the event
if you can’t be there yourself?
 Do you have access to and help from enough employees to staff the
booth?
276
Part IV: Beyond the Basics: Creating Buzz and Using Publicity 

If your answer to all these questions is no, you probably know that setting up
a booth isn’t the right option, at least right now.
You may also want to consider whether you can get volunteers (family mem-
bers, employees who are willing to work without pay) or hire temps so you
can have a presence at the event. While hiring extra help does cost you more
initially, it can pay off if your business gets the exposure it needs.
Calculating the costs: A valuable 
investment?
When you participate in a trade show or street fair event, you pay for exhibitor
space, and this varies widely depending on the venue, the duration of the
event, and the city it’s in. This booth (probably ten feet square) is made up of
a metal frame holding flimsy cloth panels on three sides to create the illusion
of privacy. You get nothing else for your money — no tables, chairs, banners,
signs, display backgrounds, nothing. So on the day before the show opens,
you have to arrange for all these important items to be delivered to the loca-
tion and set them up yourself, or you can bring your own from home, but
that’s a pain in the neck.
The event sponsors can steer you to their prearranged source for the furni-
ture and accoutrements you need. Don’t be leery of asking for guidance.
You may also want a sign company to create a display banner and other sig-
nage for your space. And what about your giveaways? (You have to have some
tchotchkes at these things.) All these extras cost you extra dough. So, before
plunking down your hard-earned money for a booth, consider all the costs.
Deciding which events are worthwhile
When deciding whether to participate in a sponsored event, you need to ask
yourself: “What’s in it for me? Will I really get added exposure to qualified
customers?” Be objective. Do a bunch of people looking for a bowl of free
chili and a paper cup of beer fit the demographic profiles of your customers?
If not, then regardless of the number of people the event promoters guaran-
tee will attend, you want to avoid the Red Hot Chili Cook-Off.
But what if you’re in the large appliance business and the big Home Improve-
ment and Remodeling Expo is coming to town? I’d say, jump on it. Pay for the
booth, haul your sample refrigerators and ranges to the convention center,
and get it on. Choosing to participate in an event is all a matter of relevance.
277
Chapter 18: Leveraging Your Advertising

Finding sponsored events that 
work for your business
So how do you find out about these industry events? Because you own a
business, you should be on the mailing lists of the Chamber of Commerce,
the local convention center, arenas, stadiums, or any other source of informa-
tion as to what events are coming to your town. If you aren’t being kept up to
date on upcoming events and shows either by mail or through your manufac-
turer’s reps, then find a way to do so. You can’t participate if you don’t know
what’s happening, and by the time you read about an event in a newspaper
ad or hear about it on the radio, it’s probably too late to get space.
If all you want is the booth space to demonstrate your wares, go directly to
the event promoter. If you want to pre-announce that you’ll be there and you
can afford the added expense, or you were going to buy advertising anyway,
buy the station’s package deal. Pre-show advertising is an important consid-
eration and is well worth the extra money.
For example, you’re the owner of a plant nursery and want to participate in
the gigantic, bombastic Annual Flower and Garden Show coming to an arena
near you. The event promoters are more than happy to sell you booth space
for, say, $1,500 for the three-day show. But what you’re getting from the pro-
moters is the booth to exhibit your stuff in — that’s it. Believe it or not, you
can also buy the same booth from your local radio station for $5,000. What
you receive from the radio station is the booth, dozens of 10- to 15-second
on-air mentions, a run-of-station spot package (a group of commercials sched-
uled throughout the day and night at the sole discretion of the station), and a
link to the station’s Web site.
You can use the 60-second spots to tell listeners what you’re selling and why
they should visit your booth. The promotional announcements that mention
your store name for two or three weeks leading up to the show aren’t going
to hurt you a bit. And linking your Web site to theirs just may generate a few
extra hits. The station has made an arrangement to sell sponsorships (and
additional exhibitor space) in exchange for a large media buy from the pro-
moters of the event. Out of your $5,000 package deal, the station still has to
pay the promoters the $1,500 for your booth, but it keeps the additional
advertising revenue for itself.
Dishing out a little extra money to your local radio station for pre-advertising
an event can pay you back in droves. Let your customers (and potential cus-
tomers) know where you’re going to be, when you’ll be there, and why they
should visit your booth.

 Keeping your message simple, clear, and effective
 Bearing in mind your budget
W
hen you’re creating ads, your primary goal is to come up with some-
thing that sticks in the minds of your target audience. In this chapter, 
I offer up ten great tips for doing exactly that.
Ignoring the Rules of Grammar
Advertising legend David Ogilvy admitted that he didn’t know the rules of
grammar. In spite of this revelation, he was, unquestionably, one of the great-
est advertising copywriters ever to have strolled down Madison Avenue. He
said, “If you’re trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something,
it seems to me you should use their language, the language they use every
day, the language in which they think. I try to write in the vernacular.” This is
wonderful advice from the master — advice that I’ve always tried to remem-
ber when writing ads for my clients, and advice that can work equally well for
you when you crank up your own creative machine and begin to write ads for
yourself.
You can ignore the rules of grammar at times — even write incomplete 
sentences — and do whatever it takes to create a hard-hitting sales message.
In radio, you have only 60 seconds; in TV, you have just 30 — and, increas-
ingly, even less time! And in print or outdoor ads, you want your message 
to be quickly understood and acted on. Those requirements don’t always
lend themselves to correct sentence structure. In short: Write the way 
people think.

Nike knew what it was doing when it coined the slogan “Just do it.”
Grammatically, this phrase makes no sense. Your high-school English 
teacher would scold the copywriter for not being clear about the antecedent
for “it.” (That’s grammar-speak for “what does ‘it’ refer to?” or, more likely,
“to what does ‘it’ refer”?) But forget those teachers (don’t worry — I won’t
tell!); Nike’s slogan was great and memorable because it reflected the way
people really talk.
Though ignoring grammatical rules can be effective in advertising, don’t go
overboard. Depending on how you phrase something, or depending on the
products or services you’re selling, it’s all too easy for a grammatically incor-
rect ad to make you look like an idiot rather than clever. If you’re advertising
a used bookstore, for example, you definitely want to use good grammar in
your advertising!
Making Your Ads Effective
Whether your advertising budget is a million a month or a thousand, you’re
wasting your money if your ads aren’t effective. And what makes ads effective
is a combination of content and creativity. Your ads must do the following:
 Give the consumer a good reason to act (content).
 Be unique enough in design and copy to attract the consumer’s 
attention in the first place (creativity).
Consumers are exposed to so much advertising on a daily basis — some of it
so subtle, they don’t even know they’re absorbing it — that you need to make
sure your ads cut through all that clutter. For more on how to do just that, go
to Chapter 5.
Knowing Why People Buy Your Products
Most retail businesses (and many manufacturers and other small businesses)
don’t know why people buy their products. They just know that people do buy
their products, so they’re somehow satisfied with their less than in-depth mar-
keting knowledge. Before you begin the creative process of finding your inim-
itable message, ask yourself a few simple questions:
 What are you selling, and what makes it so unique?
 To whom do you want to sell it?
 Why should people buy it from you as opposed to your competition?
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Some companies come right out and say in their advertising who they’re 
targeting — witness Volkswagen’s slogan for “Drivers wanted.” But you don’t
have to create the next big advertising slogan to attract people to your store
or business. You just have to use a bit more creativity than the other guys in
devising a compelling message so people choose your business over your
competition’s. (To dig a little deeper on this topic, turn to Chapter 4.)
Finding a Creative Hook
Because you want your ads to stand head and shoulders above the crowded
universe of advertising, you need to work hard at finding a creative hook —
something that grabs potential customers (but not necessarily by the neck)
and drags them to buy your products or services. A creative hook is an emo-
tional trigger that attracts the buyer, something that appeals to the self-image
of the buyer, an affirmation that you provide what the buyer is looking for. It
may be a slogan, a phrase, a jingle, a single line of copy, or a unique look that
appears in all your ads. But whatever it is, your creative hook must be yours
and yours alone, because you use it, across all media, to differentiate your
business from all the others.
Take a moment to glean from this example: DeBeers is the most well-known
diamond dealer to most people, and it continually updates its advertising. It
has been wildly successful in developing creative hooks for its ad campaigns.
Check out the following DeBeers slogans and how the company adjusted its
message to its target audience:
 “A diamond is forever.” DeBeers created this now-famous slogan to
ensure that people wouldn’t sell their diamonds, which would create a
secondary market.
 “Tell her you’d marry her all over again.” To expand its market
beyond just engagement rings, DeBeers targeted a new market of the
husbands of older, married women, with the “eternity ring” for anniver-
saries and a creative ad campaign that pitched this slogan.
 “Your left hand says you’re taken. Your right hand says you can take
over. Your left hand celebrates the day you were married. Your right
hand celebrates the day you were born. Women of the world, raise
your right hand.” To appeal to women directly, either single or married
women who want to buy a ring for themselves, DeBeers crafted the cre-
ative hook of “the right-hand ring.”
283
Chapter 19: Ten Secrets for Writing Memorable Advertising

All of DeBeers’s campaigns have strong creative hooks. They focus on the
emotional trigger of buying a diamond and appeal to the self-image of the
buyer — whether it’s a man trying to impress his future wife with the size of
the diamond in the engagement ring he’s offering or whether it’s a “right-hand
ring” symbol of self-worth that a woman buys herself. The creative hook can
mean the difference between a first-place ad and a dud that nobody notices.
Remembering That Creativity 
Is Hard Work
Advertising agencies, when designing new ad campaigns (or redesigning old
ones) often hold what is called a creative session — a meeting where all the
people who are working on a particular account gather together to come up
with ideas. Owners, creative directors, copywriters, artists, and even the
account service people contribute. These ideas then beget more and more
ideas, which, eventually, result in the perfect creative answer to the problem
at hand. The only rule of these meetings is that no idea is laughed at or dis-
carded out of hand. No idea is too far-fetched or too stupid. Everything gets
tossed onto the table.
Even if you’re not a part of an agency, you can hold these kinds of brain-
storming sessions with your coworkers, your partners, your family, and your
friends to come up with ideas for your business’s advertising campaign.
Ideas don’t just jump up and bite you. You need to search for them very 
diligently.
Letting Your Creative Hook 
Dictate Your Media Buy
When your great new idea hits you right between the eyes, when the light
bulb of creativity suddenly shines brightly, it’s time to begin incorporating
this message into a full-blown ad campaign — or, at least, as full-blown an ad
campaign as you can afford. Assuming you’ve identified all the reasons you
truly do have a unique product or service and have put your finger on a hard-
to-resist reason that people should seek you out in order to buy it, you need
to find ways to make this idea fit into various forms of advertising.
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Often, your creative hook dictates what media you use — your creative hook
literally drives your campaign. For example:
 If your hook is visual, then you can use print, collateral, TV, or the Web.
 If your concept is audio-driven, you want to use radio.
 If your clever new idea is a catchy slogan or a headline, you can con-
sider using any variety of media, including billboards or other outdoor
signage; you can also use online here.
For the ins and outs of these ad mediums, check out Parts II and IV in 
this book.
Considering Your Budget
Before you get carried away with all the great things you want to do in your
ad campaign, you need to think about your budget. You can’t buy a 50-pound
ad campaign with a 10-pound budget. So you need to carefully pick and
choose your media and adjust your message accordingly.
You don’t need to buy every media in town to get your message across. You
can accomplish your goals with not only a creative message, but also with a
creative media buy. So, before you start writing your campaign and before you
get too carried away with your creative hook, come to grips with how your
message translates into various media and how much of this media you can
afford. (For a more complete discussion, Chapter 2 is where you want to be.)
Striving for Continuity
Whatever your unique message turns out to be — whether it’s a headline, a
sentence, a slogan, a graphic, or another creative hook — use that message
consistently in all forms of media. You need to apply the same message in all
the forms of media in order to establish that message as yours and yours
alone. Plus, continuity gives the consumer a better chance to remember it.
Don’t say one thing in your radio advertising and another in print. Don’t
advertise one item in the newspaper and another on TV. Many businesses
(large and small) make this mistake over and over again, and it only serves 
to confuse the consumer and to water down your overall advertising impact
(and budget). If your radio commercials are talking about a half-price sale on
a specific item, then your newspaper ads should be featuring the same price
and sale terms for the same item.
285
Chapter 19: Ten Secrets for Writing Memorable Advertising

Keeping It Simple
Here is the best rule you can use as you work toward creating memorable
advertising for today’s marketplace: KISS. That simple acronym is something
to keep uppermost in your mind as you go through the process of writing 
and producing your ads. As you probably know, KISS stands for “Keep it
simple, stupid.”
Today, consumers are deluged with information at a rate unheard of in kinder,
gentler times. The fact that people are even capable of absorbing a tiny per-
centage of the information available to them is remarkable. And into this
cauldron of information, you now must inject quality advertising for your
business, and hope that, at the very least, consumers notice, recall, and act
on your ad. And the best way to accomplish that is to keep it simple.
Being Clear in Your Message
Whether you’re writing advertising for print, radio, television, direct mail, 
or any of the myriad forms of media, deliver your message in clear, easy-to-
understand terms. That way, consumers can see at a glance what it is you’re
selling and make a snap decision as to whether they want to read or listen
further.
Place your most powerful selling message at the beginning of the radio or TV
spot, or in the form of a headline for your printed advertising. Cut right to the
chase! Don’t get bogged down in details — the consumer doesn’t care and
won’t take the time to decipher too much copy or superfluous information.
Consumers need to read or hear your selling message immediately, and it
must be compelling enough to get them to act. If you don’t write your adver-
tising in clear, concise terms that can be easily understood, you’re wasting
your money.

(Almost) Ten Ways to Know 
It’s Time to Hire an Agency
In This Chapter
 Knowing when the time is right to hire an agency
 Being honest with yourself about your limitations
 Discerning the advantages an agency brings
You don’t need a multimillion-dollar advertising budget to seek out 
the services of an ad agency. Many local agencies provide you with 
all the services offered by the major agencies, but scaled down to fit within
your budget and your advertising requirements. If you’re thinking about
hiring an agency, take a look at the sections in this chapter. Chapter 16 
gives you pointers on hiring an ad agency, but this chapter lets you know
when you should hire one in the first place. If you see yourself in one or 
more of these reasons to hire an agency, give it some thought.
Advertising is an extremely important part of your overall marketing 
plan. Hiring a team of professionals to handle it for you is something 
you should think about. And, with many local ad agencies, it may not 
cost you as much as you think — and it may even save you quite a bit 
of time and money.
Your Ad Budget Has Become Substantial
If your advertising budget has grown to major proportions, ask yourself one
question: “Am I spending my ad budget as wisely as I could be?”

Other clues that it may be time for you to make the call include the following:
 You think you aren’t being as diligent as you could be in allocating your
advertising funds.
 Your media selections no longer give you the amount of return that your
business needs and must be expanded.
 You’re ready to admit that you need the services of a team of 
professionals to advise you in this area.
You Need the Expertise of a 
Professional Media Buyer
If you need one good reason to hire an ad agency, here it is: the media buyer.
If he is diligent and knowledgeable, he can stretch your media budget, regard-
less of its size, as tightly as it can be stretched. This person fields all phone
calls from, takes all meetings with, and gently or firmly (as the case requires)
says no to the dozens of media sales reps who want a piece of your business.
A good media buyer insists on the correct format, impressive ratings or circu-
lation, and the right audience composition and demographic before commit-
ting your hard-earned dollars to a station, newspaper, or magazine. He also
pores over media invoices to make sure you received everything he pur-
chased on your behalf. A media buyer can save you time and money.
Your Creative Light Bulb Has Burned Out
If you’re burned out with the creative process, no longer have the time to
devote to it, would rather spend your days running your business, and want
a team of creative professionals working to generate fresh, new ideas for your
business, you can find no better place than in an ad agency.
From the agency creative director to the copywriters and artists, everyone
gives you his best shot. The highly trained group of specialists employed 
by most agencies work on your account with a mutual goal — to grow your
business, keep you happy, and retain your account.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You’re Overwhelmed by the 
Demands of Production
If the myriad details of producing and placing your ads has you completely
bogged down, you need to think about calling in the pros. Start reviewing
agencies when:
 You simply don’t have the time, energy, or desire to write and produce
your own advertising.
 Creating and producing your ads has become more of a chore than 
a pleasure.
 You dread sitting down at the computer to create unforgettable prose.
You’re Having Trouble Keeping 
Up with the Bookkeeping
If the bookkeeping process of reviewing multiple media invoices each month
has become a major chore, you may want to hand off this responsibility to a
professional who does this laborious task all day long. Make a call, hire an
agency, and relax if:
 You’ve come to the conclusion that most media services (TV and radio
stations, newspapers and magazines, or outdoor ad services) write their
invoices in a secret code that you can never crack.
 You’ve reached a point of frustration with trying to determine whether
you’ve received all the spots or column inches you’ve been billed for.
 You’re avoiding the invoices until the media’s collections department
makes a nasty call.
You’re Leaving Co-Op Funds on the Table
If you aren’t receiving co-op reimbursements (see Chapter 3) because they’re
just too much trouble, hire an agency. Many businesses hire agencies to
289
Chapter 20: (Almost) Ten Ways to Know It’s Time to Hire an Agency

handle co-op funds, and, for the agency, managing these funds isn’t a big
deal. It’s time to call an agency when:
 You’re fed up with all the obligations, rules, and restrictions for collect-
ing your co-op reimbursements.
 You’re sick and tired of calling the various media to remind them that
you need notarized scripts and the proper tear sheets in order to collect
your money.
 You recognize that you have much more important things to do than
compile invoices, scripts, tapes, tear sheets, and God-only-knows-what
in order to receive a payment from your manufacturer.
Your Time Is Being Taken 
Up by Media Reps
Avoiding media reps (saving you time and headaches) may be one of the best
reasons to hire an agency. Media reps aren’t necessarily obnoxious or bother-
some, but they have a mission: to get as large a share of your advertising
budget as possible. They phone you, drop in on you, and send you faxes and
e-mails to “simply stay in touch,” and then they drop in on you again. They’re
extremely tenacious and rarely take no for answer. Their sales managers give
them a quota and, if they know your business is buying local media, they
target you. An advertising agency removes these pesky (albeit, well-meaning)
people from your life.
You’re Running Faster to 
Stay in the Same Place
You need to spend your limited and very important time productively 
running your business. Do you really have the time and energy to give full
attention to your advertising? When you hire an advertising agency, you 
can do the following:
 Eliminate a lot of daily phone calls and drop-in visits from various reps.
 Remove mountains of monthly paperwork from your desk.
 Receive a more-polished creative product from the agency than 
you’ve been producing on your own, because you have a whole gang 
of professional writers, designers, and creative directors working for
your business.
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

No one knows your business as well as you do (you become the best source
of information for your agency), but unless you want to sell your business
and become a full-time ad person, you do well to hire specialists who can
take an objective view of your advertising needs.
You Want a Bunch of Free Stuff
You should rush right out to hire an agency if you want to get all sorts of 
free lunches; rounds of golf; lift tickets to ski resorts; tickets to rock concerts,
sporting events, and movie premieres; and even vacation trips to world-class
resorts and exotic, international cities.
Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating a bit, but your agency always has a good
supply of some of these freebies (which it gets from the media it’s buying
from). And if the agency is honest about these giveaways, it passes most of
the good stuff along to you and its other clients — the people whose adver-
tising budgets earned these perks in the first place.
You’re going to spend your budget anyway. You might as well get something
extra for it.
