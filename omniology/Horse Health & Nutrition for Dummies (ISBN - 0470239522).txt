Authors’ Acknowledgments
Audrey: Thank you to my editors Georgette Beatty and Tracy Boggier; my
coauthor Dr. Kate; copy editor Sarah Faulkner; technical reviewer Carol
Habig, DVM; brilliant writer and friend Gina Spadafori; my husband Randy
Mastronicola; my sister Heidi Pavia-Watkins, DVM; my colleagues Sharon
Fibelkorn and Moira C. Harris; and my dear friend, Kelly Mount (I’m never
going to stop thanking you).
I must also thank my very patient horses, Milagro and Red, who didn’t get
ridden as much as they should have while I was writing this book.
Dr. Kate: Thank you, God, for creating this marvelous wonder, the horse.
Thank you, Audrey, for your patience in teaching me the fundamentals of
writing a book. Your passion for horses and educating their owners is second
to none. I’m very proud to have assisted you in this endeavor!
Thank you, Wiley Publishing, for creating the For Dummies books (the best in
instructive guides), and for understanding the need for this book.
Thank you, Dr. Huisheng Xie, for your teachings that have allowed me to help
horses and their owners in ways I never dreamed possible as a veterinarian.
A special thank you to Dr. Leea Arnold for being a veterinarian’s veterinarian
and a highly respected colleague and dear friend, and for giving me the
opportunity to apply acupuncture in your practice as an important healing
tool. Your support and encouragement to excel as a practitioner are grate-
fully acknowledged.
Finally, a heartfelt thank you to my husband Curt. Your knowledge and under-
standing of the equine psyche is amazing.
And a special thank you to all the horses in my life who have taught me and
given so much of themselves to help me to be a better horsewoman and
veterinarian: Glo, Tuffy, Careta, Plano, Birdie, GT, KT. Space won’t permit me
to list them all, but my heart will never forget them.

Introduction
W
elcome to Horse Health & Nutrition For Dummies. If you want to know
the best ways to take care of your horse, this is the book for you.
Horses are delicate and complicated creatures, despite their massive size
and strength. Horse owners, more so than owners of cats and dogs, tend to
be much more knowledgeable and vigilant about their animal’s health. And
with good reason. When a horse gets sick, it’s not only upsetting, but expen-
sive too.
A good working knowledge of equine nutrition and healthcare is absolutely
vital if you plan to take adequate care of your horse. You need to know exactly
what, and how much, to feed your four-legged “hayburner.” You need to know
what kind of preventative care is vital to keeping your horse in good physical
shape. And you need to be able to recognize the signs of illness when things
go wrong.
In this book, we give you all the advice that you need to comprehend the
sometimes complicated subject of equine nutrition and healthcare. In clear,
precise language, we explain everything that you need to know about how the
horse’s body functions and what you need to provide to keep that body in
good working order. We also give you details on the illnesses and conditions
most likely to plague the domestic horse.
Whether you’re a complete novice to horses, or have been involved with these
amazing creatures for decades, this book has something for you. It will serve
as a reference guide as you care for your horse on a daily basis, and it will
help you prepare for the day you decide to breed or retire your horse.
We hope that you enjoy reading this book. We enjoyed writing it and hope it
helps you give your horse a happy and healthy life.
About This Book
Horse Health & Nutrition For Dummies was designed to be a useful reference
for horse owners of novice and intermediate knowledge levels. Turn to any
section of the book that interests you and begin reading at that point — you
won’t feel lost. You don’t have to remember what you read yesterday, and
you don’t have to read chapters or sections in order. Just find an area that

you want to know more about, read it, put it into practice, and put the book
back on your shelf. We don’t expect you to read this book from cover to
cover (but we won’t complain if you do!).
If Horse Health & Nutrition For Dummies were a building, it would be a depart-
ment store that you could enter on whatever floor you like. You don’t have to
walk past that smelly perfume counter to get to the housewares section on
the third floor. You just walk into the housewares section.
We worked hard to create a book that serves as a primer on equine health
and nutrition. We hope that you find it as rewarding to read as we found it to
write. We also hope that you take all our advice — that would make us feel
really important.
Seriously, we find great joy, comfort, and fulfillment in caring for our horses,
and we hope for you the same kind of experience. Whatever you give to your
horse in the way of love and care, you’ll get back tenfold.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, we refer to horses with the male pronoun (he, his, and him) in
some sections and the female pronoun (she, hers, and her) in others. We do
this so that both genders get equal coverage!
Here are a few additional conventions that we include to help you navigate
this book:
 Italics indicate definitions and emphasize certain words.
 Boldfaced text highlights key words in bulleted lists and actions to take
in numbered lists.
 Monofont points out Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book,
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.

What You’re Not to Read
Throughout this book, we share some information that may be interesting to
you but isn’t crucial to your understanding of a given topic. This information
is either in a sidebar (a shaded gray box) or marked with a Technical Stuff
icon. We won’t be offended if you skip any of this text — we promise!
Foolish Assumptions
In this book, we assume that you have a basic knowledge of horses (maybe
you already read Horses For Dummies!), and you probably own one or more
horses. We also assume that you care a lot about your horse or horses and
want to give them the best care possible. You want to know what kind of care
you can provide safely at home and when you should seek professional help.
We also assume that you’re no dummy. You may not be a horse vet, but you’re
not one to go around pretending that you are. You know that the best way to
find out about things is to read up and ask questions of those who’ve been
around the block. You also know to call a vet when you’re concerned about
your horse’s health.
How This Book Is Organized
Horse Health & Nutrition For Dummies is made up of five parts. Each part
covers a particular topic.
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills
In order to provide your horse with good healthcare and nutrition, you need
to know the basics first. In Part I, we give you detailed information on how to
tell whether your horse is healthy, the connection between behavior and health,
and our views on good routine horse care. You find out how to groom your horse,
care for his feet, get rid of parasites, and locate a good vet. To wrap up the part,
we also explain how to exercise your horse for his optimum health.

Introduction

Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding
Part II gets into the meat of the matter (even though horses are vegetarians!).
Here we start your exploration of the art and science of feeding your horse.
We go into detail on the basics of equine nutrition and the types of food that
are available to horses. You also get the skinny on dietary supplements, and
you even find out how to grow your own horse food if you’re lucky enough to
have a lot of land out in the country.
Part III: Recognizing and 
Treating Illnesses
Part III gets to the nitty-gritty of equine health conditions and disease. You
first get a look at the inside of your horse with an overview on equine
anatomy. Then you get a close-up look at the most common conditions and
illnesses plaguing horses today. So that you can care for your horse right
away in an emergency, we cover first-aid in depth. And finally, if you’re curi-
ous about alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, chiropractic, and the
like, you get a primer on all the different alternative treatments that are avail-
able to horses today.
Part IV: Horse Care for 
All Stages of Life
Horses have different healthcare needs at different stages of their lives, and in
Part IV, you discover them in detail. We start by providing you with information
on breeding your horse, followed by how to care for a pregnant mare and a
newborn foal. Next, we leap to old age, and give you advice on making your
senior horse’s twilight years the best and most productive they can be.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the Part of Tens, we give you a rundown of signs that you can look for to
see whether your horse is feeling under the weather and what you should do
about it if she is. We also present you with a list of ways to help ensure that
your horse stays healthy and sound throughout her life.

 Taking care of your horse through all stages of life
I
f you’re a horse owner, or a horse caretaker, you want your equine companion
to be healthy. Nothing is sadder than seeing a magnificent creature like a
horse feeling sick and uncomfortable. (If you’ve ever had a sick horse on your
hands, you know what we mean.) In order to keep your horse healthy — both
mentally and physically — you need to understand what makes him tick.
Horses need good preventative care and good nutrition. These two aspects of
horse husbandry are more important than any other. If you can get these two
right, chances are you won’t have to deal with too many problems. Should illness
strike, however, recognizing the signs of a problem early on can make all the
difference.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the basics of horse health and nutrition.
We show you the signs of health to look for in your horse, explain how to
feed your horse and take care of him when he’s sick, and walk you through all
the stages of equine life.
Knowing the Traits of a Healthy Horse
You want your horse to be healthy. But knowing exactly what that means is
important. Healthy horses have the following characteristics:
 Normal temperature. It should range from 99.5 to 101.4 degrees
Fahrenheit.

 Pink gums. Look to see that your horse has moist, pink gums — not
white, bluish, or dark red.
 Gut sounds. Your horse should have gurgling sounds coming from his
rear abdominal area when you listen with a stethoscope or with your ear
close to him.
 Healthy manure. Your horse’s manure should be round and firm, not
loose and runny, or dry.
 Good appetite. Your horse should be an enthusiastic eater.
 Normal pulse. When at rest, your horse’s pulse rate should be 26 to 44
beats per minute. You can feel his pulse by placing your fingertips under
his jaw.
 Normal respiration. When you count your horse’s breaths, you should
see 8 to 16 in one minute.
 Relaxed attitude. Under normal circumstances, your horse should be
calm and relaxed, and not worried or agitated.
 Bright eyes. Your horse’s eyes should be clear, bright, and open, without
redness, swelling, or excessive tearing.
 Shiny coat. In the spring and summer months, your horse’s coat should
be glossy.
 Right weight. Your horse shouldn’t be too thin or too fat.
You can find more details on how to determine your horse’s health in
Chapter 2.
Understanding the Equine 
Mind’s Link to Health
In order for your horse to be truly healthy, she needs to be happy too. Science
has discovered that the human mind is closely tied to the health of the body,
and this appears to be true of horses as well.
How do you know whether your horse is happy? If you know equine body lan-
guage, you don’t need to have a conversation with your horse to get a sense
of her frame of mind. In Chapter 3, we give you a description of equine facial
expressions to help you determine your horse’s attitude with a single glance.
You also discover the special language of the horse and how to translate it.
The way horses see the world is an important key to providing them with an
environment that will make them happy. As social creatures who become
10
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

stressed and lonely when kept on their own, horses thrive on companionship.
They also frighten easily because of their long evolution as prey animals.
Grazing is an intrinsic part of the equine repertoire and is another aspect of
their intrinsic design. Nature intended horses to eat for nearly 18 hours a day
to allow them to take in enough nutrients to survive. Their digestive tracts need
almost constant work to stay healthy. Providing horses with plenty of forage,
served to them at least three times a day, is so important for this reason.
Movement is another requirement of the horse, and is also left over from the
days when all horses were wild. Horses fending for themselves on the open
range travel for many miles a day looking for food. As a result, the equine
body developed to need plenty of exercise.
Thwart some of these natural urges in the horse and you can end up with
behavioral problems in the form of stall vices. Cribbing, weaving, and pacing
are just some of the few neurotic behaviors common in horses who can’t handle
not having what nature intended them in the way of diet, movement, and 
stimulation. (See Chapter 3 for a detailed description of these behaviors.)
Other less neurotic but no less troublesome behaviors can also result when
horses aren’t happy. Bucking, rearing, and excessive spooking are just a few.
Finding out what’s plaguing your horse and causing her misbehavior is key to
solving the problem.
The Details of Routine Horse Care
Probably the most important component of horse health is routine care. Without
the right care every day, your horse won’t stay healthy. It’s as simple as that.
Good horse care starts with choosing the right veterinarian. Picking a vet for
your horse should be just as important as choosing a doctor for yourself. Ask
other horse owners for referrals, interview the vet to get a sense of his or her
bedside manner, and find out what kinds of services he or she offers.
Consider taking out insurance on your horse as well. Medical insurance for
horses can go a long way toward helping you pay for an illness if it strikes.
Your horse should get an annual checkup, just like you do. During this 
exam, your vet checks your horse’s teeth, gives him necessary inoculations,
and checks his vital signs. He or she also asks you questions about your horse’s
diet, behavior, and general attitude, and assists you in figuring out whether
your horse could benefit from a change in daily care.
11
Chapter 1: Taking on Your Horse's Health

The way you house your horse is another vital part of how you care for him:
 If you’re boarding, choose a stable that’s well-maintained, requires equine
boarders to show proof of vaccination, and has a professional staff.
 If you plan to keep your horse at home, develop a daily routine for your
horse to ensure his proper care. This routine should include feeding several
times a day, watering, stall cleaning, grooming, hoof cleaning, and exercise.
Your horse’s hoof care is tremendously important — “no hoof, no horse,” as
the old saying goes. Find a qualified farrier through referrals from fellow
horse owners or your veterinarian, and stick to a regular trimming and/or
shoeing schedule.
Keep parasites at bay on a regular basis by practicing fly control, making your
horse’s environment inhospitable to mosquitoes, and deworming regularly.
Tooth care is important to your horse’s health and well-being, too. Make sure
that a veterinarian examines your horse’s teeth at least once a year.
Flip to Chapter 4 for the full scoop on all these horse care tasks.
Exercising for the Best Health Possible
Exercise is incredibly important for your horse’s health, and is something that
many horse owners overlook. Horses who are stabled are in dire need of daily
exercise to keep their joints, tendons, and muscles in good shape. Exercise is
also a must for a horse’s mental well-being.
Horses who aren’t regularly exercised need to start out slowly as they build
up their bodies. Warm-ups and cool-downs are exceptionally important, and
should consist of at least 20 minutes of the horse’s total exercise time each day.
Horse owners can exercise their horses in any number of different ways,
including the following:
 Turnouts: These exercises allow the horse to roam at liberty in a large
area and are important to every stabled horse’s mental health.
 Hand-walking: This is another option and helps improve a horse’s
ground manners — as well as the owner’s fitness!
 Longeing: This is another way to exercise your horse, and it can be used
as part of a training program. It requires that you stand in the center of
an imaginary circle while your horse moves around you at the various
gaits. Warm-ups and cool-downs are especially important with this form
of exercise, which shouldn’t be overdone because it can be hard on a
horse’s legs.
12
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Riding: If you like to ride (and you probably do if you’re reading this book),
getting on your horse and exercising her this way is most likely your best
option. Make sure that you have a saddle that fits your horse properly,
and slowly work your horse up to a good fitness level if you haven’t
been riding her regularly.
Horses who work sometimes become injured and need time to rest so that they
can heal. Laying up your horse doesn’t have to be hard on you and the horse
if you take the time to provide some mental stimulation for your recovering
equine. Stall toys, companionship, and even light exercise can do wonders to
keep your horse happy while she’s healing.
See Chapter 5 for full details on exercising your horse for good health.
Feeding Your Hungry Horse
Probably the single-most important way to keep your horse healthy is to feed
him right. Horses definitely are what they eat, and the expression “garbage
in, garbage out” most certainly applies to horses.
Although it’s often overlooked, water is the single most important part of
your horse’s daily diet. Without water, your horse would die in a very short
time. Providing plenty of clean, fresh, palatable water is essential to keeping
your horse healthy.
Horses also need plenty of forage to keep their digestive systems working
efficiently. Most often in the form of hay or pasture, forage provides different
types of nutrients and protein and carbohydrate levels, depending on the type.
Fats are also important in the horse’s diet, and should be provided on a daily
basis. The easiest way to provide fat to horses is to give them oil on their
feed each day. Corn oil is the best choice because it’s the least expensive and
easy to find (your grocery store!).
Horses must have vitamins and minerals to stay healthy, of course, but that
doesn’t mean that you need to give them a vitamin and mineral tablet every day.
The right feed should provide your horse with all the vitamins and minerals he
needs if it’s fresh and of the right type.
Chapter 6 provides full details on all these building blocks of equine nutrition.
Chapter 7 covers feeding fundamentals; we describe different types of hay
and pasture, talk about other types of feeds that you may want to consider,
and walk you through the steps of feeding your horse properly.
13
Chapter 1: Taking on Your Horse's Health

Do you have an equine friend with special diet needs? Chapter 8 is the chapter
for you! We discuss using dietary supplements and helping horses with weight
and allergy problems. And if you’re a do-it-yourself kind of person, Chapter 9
provides an introduction to growing food for your horse.
Tackling Disease
If the worst happens and your horse comes down with something, the best
way to handle it is to stay calm and educate yourself. Call your vet out as soon
as you sense that something is wrong, and learn as much as you can about your
horse’s diagnosis. Knowledge is power when it comes to veterinary issues, and
you’ll feel better with a thorough understanding of whatever is ailing your horse.
In the following sections, we discuss common equine ailments and infectious
diseases, give you the basics of first aid, and introduce you to complementary
therapies available for horses.
Common ailments
Issues that most often plague horses can be grouped in the following categories:
 Soundness issues. These problems affect the joints, tendons, ligaments,
and/or muscles of the horse’s legs.
 Digestive woes. Manifesting themselves as colic or diarrhea, these
problems relate to either the upper or lower digestive tracts.
 Skin disorders. Anything from allergies to bacterial and fungal infections
falls into this category.
 Eye problems. Horses are prone to some of the same eye problems as
humans, plus a few of their own.
 Respiratory issues. Breathing problems aren’t common in horses, but
when they occur, they can be very troublesome.
 Systemic problems. Metabolic and immune system disorders make up
this category.
Chapter 11 gives a detailed rundown of common conditions in each of these
categories, and provides information on how each is treated.
14
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Infectious diseases
A whole slew of infectious diseases regularly sweep through equine populations,
and every horse owner needs to know how to recognize the symptoms of
these ailments.
Some of these ailments are similar to infectious diseases that affect humans as
well. These include equine influenza (the horse version of the flu), equine herpes
virus (similar to the herpes virus that affects people), rabies, and tetanus.
Other infectious diseases that are unique to horses include strangles, a
bacterium that affects the lymph nodes; equine protozoal myeloencephalitis
(EPM), a protozoan parasite that attacks the nervous system; and equine
infectious anemia, a virus that causes an anemic reaction.
Chapter 12 details all these diseases, as well as a few others that affect horses.
The good news is that many of these diseases have vaccines (we talk about
vaccinating your horse in detail in Chapter 4).
First aid
For some reason, horses seem prone to injury, which is why it’s important for
all horse owners to know basic first aid. Keeping a first-aid kit around is a
must if you want to be ready to handle whatever injury your horse may incur.
Your first-aid kits should include the following items:
 Antibiotic ointment
 Antiseptic cleanser
 Bandages
 Cotton sheets or quilted wraps
 Duct tape
 Flexible bandages
 Gauze pads
 Hand sanitizer
 Latex gloves
 Lubricant
 Pocket knife
 Rectal thermometer
15
Chapter 1: Taking on Your Horse's Health

 Rubbing alcohol
 Scissors
 Tweezers
 Wound medication
Chapter 13 provides information on how and when to use each of these items.
It also covers details on how to know when to call the vet, and when to handle
an emergency yourself.
Alternative therapies
More and more horse owners today are becoming interested in alternative
and complementary therapies. These types of therapies, which include
acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine, and chiropractic, have
been demonstrated to help horses in ways unprecedented in conventional
veterinary medicine.
Veterinarians and other specialists working in these modalities are now prac-
ticing throughout the United States, making these types of therapies more
accessible to the average horse owner. Chapter 14 covers a number of alter-
native and complementary therapies used on horses, detailing how they work
and for what types of conditions.
Caring for Mare and Foal
If you have a mare you plan to breed so that you can have your own foal, you’re
embarking on a very special adventure in horse ownership. Breeding and
birthing a foal, which we cover in Chapter 15, is an exciting experience that
you’ll never forget.
Before you breed, though, you need to research this aspect of horse husbandry
carefully. Pregnant mares need special attention in order to deliver a healthy
baby, and you as the mare owner must provide this care.
The birth of a foal is a crucial moment for both mother and baby, and it must be
handled expertly if both horses are to survive. Your veterinarian will educate
you about what to expect the day your mare delivers her foal, and coach you
about when you need to call him or her to help.
16
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

After your baby hits the ground, your job as caretaker doesn’t stop. Young
foals need special monitoring during their first 24 hours to have a chance at
survival. Training of the foal begins right away, and you’re the one who needs
to start teaching your youngster from the get-go. Chapter 16 provides informa-
tion on how to start teaching your baby how to grow up to be a good horse.
Easing into the Senior Years
Aged horses are those who are more than 15 years old. Although these are
considered your horse’s golden years, they’re likely to be the best ones of his
life. Older horses are wise in the ways of the world, and they rarely waste
their time worrying about the kinds of stuff that upsets younger horses —
like plastic shopping bags blowing down the trail. Boo!
Senior horses also tend to be more patient and forgiving than their younger
counterparts, so they make the best teachers for children and new adult riders.
The trade-off for all that your senior horse gives you is that you need to take
special care of his needs as he gets older. Older horses are more prone to
lameness, vision problems, and tooth problems. They sometimes need spe-
cial consideration when it comes to feeding and exercise.
Senior horses do best when they have a job to do, and although many horse
owners think that their older horses would rather be retired, these horses
often become depressed and feel neglected when their work stops. Chapter
17 tells you how to keep your senior horse active for as long as possible, and
how to ease him into retirement when he can no longer work.
In Chapter 18, we take a look at the end of your horse’s life. Euthanasia is a
humane option for horses who are incurably ill or suffering, and it’s often the
best gift an owner can give his or her horse. Loss of a horse is often followed
by intense grief. In this chapter, we let you know that you aren’t alone, and
we help you find ways to remember and celebrate your horse’s life.

Chapter 2
Sizing Up a Healthy Horse
In This Chapter
 Recognizing a horse in good health
 Examining your horse each day
 Judging a new horse’s condition
H
orses are big, strong animals, but they’re surprisingly fragile. They can
easily and quickly become ill. Add their ability to hide their illnesses
(sick animals attract attention from predators) and it can be challenging for
horse owners to know when their horse is ill.
In this chapter, you discover the telltale signs of a horse who’s at the peak of
health. If you plan on adding another horse to your family, you also find out
how to make sure that horse is in good health. After you can recognize the signs
of health in a horse, you’ll be quick to tell when your horse isn’t feeling well.
A great way of keeping track of whether all is well is to groom and go over
your horse’s body every day. Check out Chapter 4 for details on grooming
tasks such as brushing your horse and cleaning her hooves.
Gauging the Signs of a Healthy Horse
Whether you own a foal or a senior, a draft horse or a miniature, you can tell
whether your horse is feeling ill by looking at a number of different factors.
Each of the following factors alone or combined with other elements can tell
you whether your horse is fighting an illness. If you suspect that your horse
is sick, either based on the results of checking the following different aspects
of her health or for any other reason, call a veterinarian right away.
One of the greatest benefits of being able to recognize the signs of a healthy
horse (versus an unhealthy one) is that you can share important information
with your veterinarian. Should you need to call the vet to report a problem with
your horse, being able to pass along specific details on the horse’s condition
will help the vet determine whether or not your horse needs to be seen right

away. Knowing what’s normal for your horse when she’s feeling her best
enables both you and your veterinarian to determine whether your horse
needs veterinary care when she’s under the weather.
A normal temperature
If your horse is off her feed or just doesn’t seem right, check her temperature.
You probably know that 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is considered a normal tem-
perature for a human being. Horses have a normal temperature too, which is
slightly higher than that of their human companions. A healthy adult horse has
a body temperature of 99.5 to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Healthy young horses,
specifically foals and yearlings, can have slightly higher temperatures.
Environmental factors can affect a horse’s temperature. A horse may have a
higher temperature if the weather is particularly hot (or a lower-than-normal
temperature if the weather is cold), or if the horse has just finished exercising
or eating. Time of day can also be a factor: body temperatures of both horses
and humans tend to be higher in the afternoon than in the earlier or later times
of the day. Nerves can also affect a horse’s body temperature, causing it to
rise slightly.
If a horse’s temperature is lower than 97 degrees Fahrenheit, something isn’t
right with her body, and she may be suffering from shock, chill, or a serious
illness. If her temperature is higher than 102, she’s likely battling an infection
of some kind, is dangerously overheated, or is colicky. Body temperatures below
97 or above 102 warrant an immediate call to the vet.
Taking your horse’s temperature isn’t as easy as taking your own. Unlike humans,
horses don’t have the ability to hold a thermometer under their tongue, and
you can’t insert it in their ear. Instead, you have to go the old-fashioned route,
the one that your mother probably used to take your temperature when you
were a baby. The job must be done rectally.
Before you can take your horse’s temperature, you need to purchase a veterinary
thermometer from a pet supply or tack store. Veterinary thermometers have
a loop at the end, and you can tie some string or yarn onto the device, making
it easier to hold onto while taking the horse’s temperature.
You need lubricant, too. K-Y Jelly or another human-grade lubricant is suffi-
cient. Stay away from petroleum jelly because it can irritate the sensitive
lining of the rectum. In a pinch, you can use your own saliva as a lubricant.
Follow this procedure to find out your horse’s temperature (be sure to halter
and tie her first):
1. Prepare the thermometer.
20
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Make sure that the thermometer reads 96 degrees or below by shaking it
down first.
2. Lubricate the thermometer.
Apply a good amount (about an inch) of lubricant to the thermometer’s
tip so that it slides in easily.
3. Prepare your horse.
Some horses are very calm when you take their temperature; others freak
out. If you have the kind of horse who doesn’t appreciate the procedure,
untie her and ask someone to hold the lead rope while you insert the
thermometer. Position the horse against a wall so that she can’t move
away from you. Be patient and try to reassure the horse that nothing
terrible is about to happen to her.
4. Insert the thermometer.
Stand to the side of the horse and not directly behind her so that you don’t
get kicked if the horse reacts violently to insertion of the thermometer.
(Figure 2-1 shows you how to stand before inserting the thermometer.) Hold
the thermometer at an angle parallel to the horse’s back, lift the tail, and
slowly insert the thermometer about 3 inches into the horse’s rectum.
The thermometer should slide in gently.
If the thermometer stops part way in and won’t move forward, don’t
force it. Instead, pull it out and reinsert, angling it slightly up or down
until it gently slides in.
5. Wait three minutes.
Keep the thermometer inside the horse’s rectum for three minutes, holding
onto the end or the string the entire time.
6. Read the thermometer.
After three minutes, you can remove the thermometer and read it. Be sure
to wash your thermometer in soap and lukewarm water and dip it in rub-
bing alcohol after every reading. Don’t forget to wash your hands, too.

Pink gums
It may not have occurred to you that you can tell the state of your horse’s health
by looking at her gums, but in fact, you can. The gums can be a good indicator
of digestive health and blood flow. Different colors mean different things:
 A healthy horse has gums that are a pinkish color. This color indicates,
via the horse’s mucous membranes, that she has good blood flow in her
body.
 Horses who are suffering from colic, shock, or illness may have pale
gums that are almost white.
 Horses who have an illness or fever may have bright red gums.
 Horses suffering from poor circulation may have bluish gums.
Check your horse’s gums when she’s feeling fine so that you get a sense of
what her normal gum color looks like. That way, if you suspect that she’s ill,
you have something to compare the color to.
Figure 2-1:
When you
take a
horse’s
temperature,

side and not

behind her.
22
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Gum color alone isn’t usually the sole indicator of trouble for a horse, but
combined with signs of colic or other types of distress, it can indicate a
severe condition that requires a phone call to the vet. See Chapter 11 for
more about colic.
If you’ve never looked at your horse’s gums before, halter your horse and
follow this procedure to get it done. Having a helper is best, but if you can’t
find anyone to assist you, you can do it alone.
1. Secure the horse.
Have your helper hold the lead rope for you. If no helper is available,
hold the lead rope in your left hand.
2. Prepare the horse for your approach.
Stand at the left side of the horse near her muzzle. Talk to your horse
and reassure her, and stroke her on the cheek a few times.
3. Lift her lip.
With your palm facing the horse’s face, gently lift the side of your
horse’s lip until you can see her gums.
4. Finish up.
When you’re able to get a good look at the color, you can drop her lip.
If your horse struggles when you try to lift her lip, continue a few more times. If
she absolutely won’t allow you to touch her mouth, a vet will have to check it
for you.
Gut sounds
The digestive system is one of the most delicate and crucial systems in a
horse’s body (as you find out in Chapter 10). Because horses are unable to
vomit, whatever they consume must be passed, regardless of what it is or
how it may affect the digestive system.
Horses who are suffering from colic, which is another term for abdominal pain,
may be experiencing a problem in their digestive system. In most cases, colic
causes the digestive system to shut down. The result is that gut sounds — the
noises the stomach and intestines make as they’re working normally — aren’t
present.
If a horse appears to be showing signs of colic, such as pacing and sweating,
straining to urinate or defecate, pawing at the ground, rolling repeatedly,
standing in a stretched-out position, or kicking and biting at her sides, you
may be able to get a sense of how serious her condition may be by listening
for gut sounds. A horse with no gut sounds is a horse in trouble — and in
23
Chapter 2: Sizing Up a Healthy Horse

need of a vet. However, the presence of gut sounds doesn’t always indicate
normal gut motility or health.
You can listen for gut sounds in one of two ways, either with a stethoscope
(the best way) or your naked ear. Whichever you use, halter your horse and
follow this procedure:
1. Secure the horse.
Tie your horse, or have someone hold the lead rope for you.
2. Find gut sounds.
Place your ear or stethoscope on your horse’s barrel, just behind her
last rib. Listen for several seconds for gurgling sounds. (See Figure 2-2 to
get an idea of where to listen.)
3. Check the other side.
If you don’t hear sounds on the side that you’re checking, move to the
other side of the horse and listen again.
4. Assess the results.
If you hear gurgling sounds, your horse’s digestive system may still be
functioning. If you don’t hear gurgling sounds, your horse is in trouble.
Figure 2-2:

24
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Either way, if your horse is showing symptoms of colic, with or without
gut sounds, you need to call the vet. Your assessment of the presence or
absence of gut sounds is important information to convey to your 
veterinarian.
Good manure
A sure sign of a healthy equine digestive system is good manure. Although
examining your horse’s poop every day may seem silly, keeping an eye on it
can really help you stay in touch with your horse’s well-being.
Good manure indicates that a horse is properly processing her food. It shows
that she’s drinking enough water and that her system is passing feces in a
productive manner.
If you break apart horse manure, you see that it’s made up of digested plant
material. Healthy horse manure comes out in moist, firm, round balls. It
shouldn’t be runny or unformed. Nor should it be hard and dry. (See Figure 2-3
for a picture of healthy manure.)
Horses defecate several times a day, depending on how much and how often
they eat. A horse who eats three meals of hay per day eliminates anywhere from
five to eight piles of manure. These piles translate to about 31 pounds of poop
per day. This number varies from horse to horse, so take note of how much
manure your horse produces when she’s healthy to help you determine
whether something isn’t right on the day she doesn’t seem to be feeling well.
If you see that her manure output is lower than normal, even though she’s
eating as much as usual, keep a close eye on her. Her intestines may be slowing
down due to a problem.
Figure 2-3:

manure

like firm,

25
Chapter 2: Sizing Up a Healthy Horse

Horses who produce no manure at all throughout the day even though they
have eaten are in trouble. Something is preventing the manure from passing
through the intestine, and a blockage is sure to occur. This blockage could be
the result of anything from lack of water intake to an abundance of sand in
the intestine. Only a vet can determine the actual cause behind the lack of
manure production.
A healthy appetite
Horses are big eaters by nature — they’re designed to consume food 18
hours per day. That’s why they never turn down a meal or a snack — unless
they’re under the weather.
Horses eat anywhere from 1.5 to 3 percent of their body weight every day. If
you’re around your horse at mealtime, you no doubt notice her eating habits.
Most horses who are kept stabled eagerly await their meals and dive right
into them when they’re served. Horses kept on pasture graze almost all day
and into the night if grass is available.
Horses who are sick turn their nose up at foods that they normally enjoy.
They may sample a little and then walk away. Or they may show no interest
at all. A horse who won’t eat is a very sick horse and needs veterinary care
right away.
On the other hand, just because a horse is eating doesn’t mean that she’s
healthy. Many horses with serious illnesses maintain their normal appetite
through much of their sickness. They may start turning down food only at the
most acute stage of the disease or condition.
If your horse won’t eat, or isn’t eating as much as is normal for her, she’s not
feeling well. If she shows other signs of illness but is still eating, don’t assume
that she’s okay; contact your vet immediately.
A normal pulse
Just like people, horses have a normal, resting pulse rate. The pulse rate 
indicates how many beats per minute your horse’s heart is pumping. When
horses are exercising, their pulse rate increases normally. When they’re ill,
under extreme stress, or in pain, their pulse rate quickens.
For most adult horses, a normal resting pulse rate is 28 to 40 beats per
minute. This number can vary substantially based on breed and age, how-
ever. Knowing your horse’s normal pulse rate when she’s feeling well gives
you something to compare it with if she seems to be under the weather.
26
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Taking your horse’s pulse takes a little bit of practice. Locating the pulse can
be hard at first, but if you keep trying, you’ll get the hang of it. After you
halter and tie your horse, follow these steps to take her pulse:
1. Find the pulse.
Put the tips of your index, ring, and middle fingers behind the horse’s
girth on the left side; on the inside of the foreleg; or under the jawbone,
below the jowls. You can detect the pulse in all these areas. Figure 2-4
shows you one spot where you can look for the pulse. (See Chapter 10
for a diagram showing the parts of the horse.)
2. Count the beats.
When you find the pulse, start counting the beats for 15 seconds, using a
watch or a clock with a second hand.
3. Calculate the rate.
Multiply the number you get by four — that’s your horse’s heart rate per
minute.
Take your horse’s pulse when she’s healthy so that you know her normal
pulse rate. Having this information will be valuable to your veterinarian if
your horse becomes ill. It gives the vet a baseline reading for comparison.
Normal respiration
The way a horse breathes can be a good indicator of her health. Horses at
rest with abnormal respiration, or breathing rate, are likely not feeling well.
They may have a fever, they may be experiencing pain, or they may be having
trouble taking in air.

horse’s
pulse by

tips of your

27
Chapter 2: Sizing Up a Healthy Horse

Respiration is the inhalation and exhalation of air into and out of the lungs.
Normal respiration rate for a horse from weanling to adult age — and who
hasn’t been active for at least 20 minutes — is 8 to 16 complete breaths in
one minute.
Determining how many breaths per minute your horse is taking is easy. All
you need to do is watch her breathing while you count. Halter and tie your
horse, wait until she’s quiet, and then follow these steps (and take a look at
Figure 2-5) to check your horse’s breathing:
1. Count breaths.
Using a watch or clock with a second hand, count the times her flanks
(or area between her barrel and thigh) expand outward in 15 seconds.
(See Chapter 10 for parts of the horse.)
2. Calculate the number.
Multiply the number of breaths by four. The resulting amount is the
number of breaths per minute.
Take your horse’s respiration rate when she’s healthy so that you have a
baseline reading to compare with when your horse is under the weather.
Figure 2-5:

A relaxed attitude
When a horse is feeling well, she tends to have a relaxed attitude when she’s
at rest. Her muscles are void of tension, she has a calm expression, and she
seems to be enjoying life. (See Figure 2-6 for a picture of a horse with a relaxed
attitude.) Horses who are sick, on the other hand, tend to be tense or depressed.
They may have taut muscles, or they may stand with their heads hanging down.
Familiarity with your horse and horses in general can help you determine
whether a horse’s demeanor is relaxed or distraught. Relaxed horses tend to
doze, eat, and interact with other horses with a quiet manner. Sick horses,
however, become either aggressive or submissive with other horses, sleep
too much or not enough, and eat in an anxious manner or not at all. If you
notice these behaviors in your horse and see some of the other symptoms
covered in this chapter as well, call your veterinarian.

Chapter 2: Sizing Up a Healthy Horse

Bright eyes
The expression says, “The eyes are the window to the soul,” and this is most
certainly true of horses. You can tell a lot about a horse’s health by looking at
her eyes. A horse with healthy eyes is most likely a horse with a healthy body.
Look for the following signs:
 Healthy equine eyes are bright and alert. They’re clear and lacking in
discharge. The horse holds them wide open when you approach her, and
you see no swelling or redness.
 Horses who are in moderate pain or who are seriously ill have a dull look
in their eyes. They may keep one or both eyes half-closed or completely
shut. Their eyes may be runny, swollen, and/or a reddish color where
white sclera (the part of the eye that surrounds the iris) should be.
 When a horse is in acute pain, her eyes are wide open, and white sclera
will show. Horses in this much pain often behave in an anxious manner
as well.
Check your horse’s eyes daily. Stand to the side of your horse, and concentrate
on her eye. Make sure that it’s open, bright, clear, and not runny. Peek into
the corners and edges without touching the eye, and look for warts or growths.
Do the same thing on the other side with the other eye.
If your horse’s eyes appear irritated, swollen, runny, or cloudy, call your vet.
Mild irritation may be the result of dust or wind, but any dramatic change in
your horse’s eyes should be evaluated by a vet. Horses with a cloudy or
milky looking eye(s) may have an eye disease or injury and should be evalu-
ated by a veterinarian immediately.
A shiny coat
A shiny coat is a sign of good health in a horse. In the summertime, after a
horse sheds her coat, the hair should be glossy and slick. Horses who are
seriously ill or infested with internal parasites develop a dull, unattractive
coat. Horses who are malnourished also have a coat that’s lacking in shine.
In the wintertime, many horses grow thick, wooly coats to help them ward 
off the cold. These bushy coats are often too dense to have any real sheen to
them. The best time of year to judge a horse’s coat is in late spring or summer
when the winter coat has shed out and been replaced with a shorter coat.
If your horse doesn’t shed her winter coat, or is slower to do it than other
horses who live near her, she may be overburdened with intestinal parasites,
or she may be developing Cushing’s syndrome (see Chapter 11 for more
information on Cushing’s syndrome). Call your veterinarian for a checkup.

The right weight
Horses who are either underweight or overweight are inherently unhealthy.
Figures 2-7, 2-8, and 2-9 give you an idea of what underweight, just-right, and
overweight horses look like.
 An underweight horse has a sunken rump, a cavity under the tail, easily
visible ribs, and a prominent backbone. Horses who are underweight
often suffer from a lack of energy. They have trouble staying warm in
cold weather, and they’re more susceptible to illness than a horse at
normal weight.
 A horse at a good weight has a rounded rump, ribs that are covered but
easily felt, and no crest to the neck.
 An overweight horse has a well-rounded rump, a gutter along the back,
ribs and a pelvis that are hard to feel, and a slight crest to the neck.
Overweight horses are at great risk for leg problems, particularly laminitis
(see Chapter 11 for more about this condition). They also become
winded sooner than fit horses do, and they may develop other health
problems as a result of their weight.

Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

One way to judge your horse’s weight is to eyeball her. Using Figures 2-7, 2-8,
and 2-9 as a guide, you can determine whether your horse is underweight or
overweight. To get the approximate weight of your horse — which is helpful
when determining whether your horse has lost or gained weight — halter and
tie your horse securely on level ground, and then follow these steps (see
Figure 2-10 for help):
1. Measure the girth.
Use a measuring tape to measure your horse’s girth, about 4 inches behind
the front legs. Start at the withers and wrap the tape all the way around
until it meets the end of the tape. It should be tight enough that it puts a
slight depression on the flesh. (See Chapter 10 for an illustration showing
the parts of the horse.)
2. Measure the length.
Next, measure the length of your horse, starting at the point of the
shoulder, near the chest, to the point of the buttock.
3. Do it again.
Repeat these measurements several times to ensure accuracy.
4. Do some math.
Take the girth measurement and multiply it by itself (square it, in other
words). Then multiply this number by the length measurement. Divide
this number by 330. The answer is your horse’s weight.
The formula is:
(Girth2 × Length) ÷ 330 = Weight
So if your horse measures 68 inches around the girth, and 74 inches in
length, she weighs approximately 1,036 pounds:
(682 × 74) ÷ 330 = 1,036
Many horses fall in this weight range, but your horse’s height and breed
may cause this number to vary by several hundred pounds in either
direction. Have your veterinarian evaluate your horse’s weight and advise
you on whether your horse needs to lose or gain weight — or is just right.
33
Chapter 2: Sizing Up a Healthy Horse

Keeping a horse at the right weight can be a challenge. Each horse’s metabolism
is different, and too much food for one horse isn’t enough for another. Getting to
know your horse and what type of feed and amounts have the most positive
effect on her body is your task as a horse owner. Chapter 7 can help you deter-
mine the best diet for your equine companion. Your veterinarian should be able
to help you come up with a feeding plan that’s right for your horse.
Adding Another Healthy 
Horse to the Family
Horses are like potato chips, and if you don’t already have more than one,
you’ll probably get another one soon enough. But before you add another
horse to the family, make sure that the animal you’re considering is healthy.
This step helps ensure the health of your existing horse, and prevents you
from taking on an animal with conditions that need to be treated.
You can determine the new horse’s health in two ways. The first is just to
give him the once-over. The second is to call in a professional and have him
examined thoroughly. The latter is the more effective of the two and the one
we most recommend.

Recognizing general signs 
of health before you buy
When looking at a horse that you’re thinking of buying or adopting, ask yourself
the following questions:
 Does the horse have an alert attitude?
 Does the horse have an appetite?
 Can he walk, trot, and canter without limping or stumbling?
 Are his eyes clear and bright?
 Is his coat shiny?
 Does he have healthy-looking manure?
 Is his nose free from thick, white, yellow, or green discharge?
If you can say yes to all these questions, the horse has passed the first, most
cursory health test. If you say no to even one of these questions, call your vet
right away (see the next section for details).
Getting a vet check
The best way to determine whether a horse you’re planning to add to the
family is healthy is to hire a veterinarian to do a thorough pre-purchase exam.
During a pre-purchase exam, or vet check, an equine veterinarian takes a close
look at the horse to determine whether the animal is healthy.
The veterinarian examines the horse in the following manner:
 The vet looks in the horse’s eyes, listens to his heart and lungs, and
checks his gut sounds to make sure that the digestive system is in good
working order.
 The vet looks for signs of lameness. He or she watches the horse trot on
hard ground, and performs a flexion test, which involves bending each
of the horse’s legs and holding the hoof tight against the elbow or stifle
and then watching the horse’s trot immediately afterward. This test
helps determine whether the horse has issues with one or more legs.
The horse may limp on any of the legs that may have problems.
The vet will also evaluate the hooves with the hoof testers. This evaluation
involves taking a tool called a hoof tester and squeezing the top and
bottom of the horse’s foot. If the horse pulls away or twitches, it indicates
pain, which in turn may indicate a problem.
35
Chapter 2: Sizing Up a Healthy Horse

If the veterinarian finds issues with any of the horse’s legs during the
lameness exam, you may want to take X-rays to help determine exactly
what may be causing the problem.
 You may want the veterinarian to do blood work. Blood work can consist
of a basic blood panel, where the vet checks the horse’s red and white
blood count and other areas of the blood that indicate overall health.
After the exam is completed, the vet discusses the results with you. The
veterinarian can help you determine whether the horse is the right choice 
for you, depending on what you plan to do with the horse after you buy it.
Whether you buy the horse is ultimately up to you.

Connecting Your Horse’s 
Behavior to Health
In This Chapter
 Recognizing typical equine behavior
 Coping with misbehaviors
B
ehavior and health are closely related in the world of horses. Happy,
healthy horses are generally more cooperative than unhappy, unhealthy
horses. Your goal as a horse owner is to keep your horse not just physically
healthy, but mentally well too. The two go hand in hand.
The way your horse behaves is closely related to how he feels. Horses can’t
talk, so the only way they can let you know how they’re feeling is through their
behavior. When horses are feeling physically well, they often behave well too.
Of course perfect health doesn’t give you a perfectly well-behaved horse, but
you can be sure that if your horse is feeling sick, he’s going to communicate
that to you somehow. And those feelings may be cloaked in bad behavior.
In this chapter, we take a look at normal horse behavior and how it manifests
itself in a horse’s daily life. We also investigate horse misbehaviors and how
they can communicate the way a horse is feeling on the inside.
Horse Behavior 101
In order to use behavior observation to understand how your horse is feeling,
you must know the difference between typical equine behavior, which we
discuss in the following sections, and bad behavior with a message of poor
health, which we discuss later in this chapter.

38
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 
Seeing the world from 
a horse’s perspective
If you want to keep your horse happy and healthy, you have to know what life
is like from her perspective — and you have to understand her basic needs.
Not just her needs from a physical perspective, but from a psychological
viewpoint as well.
Keep the following points in mind when you’re handling your horse, deter-
mining how to provide her with daily care and housing. Knowing what’s best
for her mind leads you to what’s best for her body.
 Horses are prey. Horses evolved over the millennia as prey animals, dinner
on the hoof for all kinds of large predators. Consequently, horses tend to
be nervous creatures who are programmed to always be on the lookout
for danger. Be patient and understanding with your horse when she acts
scared of something that seems silly to you.
 Horses are social creatures. An integral aspect to the horse’s survival
as a species has been its evolution as a herd animal. There’s safety in
numbers, and horses feel safest and the least stressed when they live
and work around members of their own kind. (Watch a group of horses
in a field and you see how much they genuinely enjoy each other’s com-
pany. Horses in a herd express strong bonds by grooming each other
with their teeth, taking turns tail-swishing flies from each other’s faces,
and playing silly horses games like tag and “let’s bite each other.”) Those
horses who are kept alone are living an unnatural life and simply don’t
do as well. Try to stable your horse near at least one other horse so that
she has someone to keep her company.
 Horses recognize hierarchy. Part of living in a social structure is recogniz-
ing the hierarchy that inevitably forms when creatures of the same species
live closely together. Horses follow a precise pecking order, with a leader at
the top of the heap who lords over the group. The individual personalities
of various herd members, along with factors such as age and physical abil-
ity, determine which horses take on which roles within the herd.
Every horse looks for a leader (whether human or equine) to guide her.
In the absence of one, she either takes over the role herself or becomes
stressed out. Horses do what humans ask them to do because they see
humans as their leaders. You have to earn this role — another reason
the proper training of young horses is so important. (See Chapter 16 on
training baby horses for more on humans as herd leaders. If you’re looking
for more help on developing the leadership skills to handle your horse,
see Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by coauthor Audrey with
Janice Posnikoff, DVM, and published by Wiley.)

 Horses need stimulation. In the wild, horses spend their days interacting
with one another, picking through different kinds of plants to see which
ones they want to eat, and traveling through unfamiliar territory. They
get bored living alone in stalls with little to eat, no one to visit with, and
nothing to do. Feed your horse frequent small meals, and take her out to
exercise daily.
Tuning in to equine communication
Horses are social creatures. And like all social creatures, they have a refined
way of communicating with one another. While humans use verbal language
to get messages across, horses use facial expressions and body language to
say what they mean.
Typical facial expressions
Just by looking at your horse’s face, you should be able to judge whether she’s
relaxed, alert, frightened, or aggressive. After you understand what the different
equine expressions mean and what’s behind them, you’re in a position to know
your horse’s state of mind — and body.
Here’s a list of the most common equine facial expressions and what they
mean (see Figure 3-1 for illustrations of these expressions):
 Relaxation: Happy, healthy horses are often relaxed, especially when
eating, being groomed, or even when being ridden. You know that your
horse is relaxed when her ears aren’t pointed too far forward, and in fact
are often pointing backward. She has a calm look in her eye, and her
head is at medium height.
 Alertness: Healthy horses abound in this expression, which indicates
that they’re content and curious about their surroundings. If your horse
is alert, her ears are pricked forward, and her eyes are focused on what-
ever has piqued her interest. She holds her head at medium height.
 Anxiety: Because they’re prey animals by nature, horses are often fearful,
waiting and wondering where the next predator will come from. A horse
who’s scared points her ears toward her source of fear. She holds her
head high and the whites of the eye are showing. You can sometimes
actually see the muscles in the neck tense up. In cases of severe pain,
horses may show this same expression, although their concern isn’t
focused on an outside source — instead, it seems to be generated from
within. Horses who are afraid of the vet or of your approach with
medication show the same expression.
39
Chapter 3: Connecting Your Horse's Behavior to Health

 Aggression: If your horse lays her ears back flat against her head, her
nostrils take on an oblong shape, and her teeth are bared, look out. She’s
in aggression mode. Some horses are basically ill-tempered and don’t
like anyone, or only like certain people and other horses. Others behave
with aggression only if they’re in pain or afraid (see the later section “A
bad attitude” for more details). Whatever the reason, take heed if your
horse shows you an aggressive face. Horses are dangerous when they’re
in an aggressive mood. Gauge what’s making the horse aggressive if you
can (some horses get this way when they’re eating, for example), and
talk to a professional trainer about how to fix the problem. It’s not okay
for your horse to behave aggressively toward you.
Spend time with your horse and get to know her expressions when she’s feeling

than health and well-being.

Common body language
Facial expressions are only one way that horses get their message across to
each other and to their human companions. Body language is an important
tool in communication, and something every horse relies on.
 Biting: Horses like to bite each other. Sometimes they do it in play; other
times they do it out of aggression. Sometimes they bite humans for the
same reason, which is, of course, unacceptable.
When horses are in pain or very unhappy, they may bite. The bite may
be directed toward another horse or toward a human handler.
 Kicking: When horses kick, they do it to play, to be aggressive, or in self-
defense. Kicks can be directed at each other or at humans. Sick horses
or horses being handled by a veterinarian are more likely to kick, usually
out of self-defense because they don’t understand that humans are
trying to help them.
 Pawing: Horses paw the ground with a front hoof when they’re anxious,
excited, or bored. They also do it if they’re in pain. Colicky horses some-
times paw at the ground as an expression of their discomfort. (See
Chapter 11 for more about colic.)
 Pacing: Horses who are bored or anxious may pace back and forth
across their stall or pasture. This reaction is common when horses are
separated from other herd members. It can also be a sign of abdominal
pain. If your horse is pawing and showing other signs of colic, call your
veterinarian. (See Chapter 13 for other signs of colic.)
 Pushing: Horses use their bodies to send messages to other horses, and
one of these maneuvers is pushing. Horses use “shoulder blocks” to shove
other horses out of the way. A dominant horse shoves a more subordinate
horse away from food, or uses her body to move the horse in a certain
direction. Horses who haven’t been properly trained may also use their
bodies to push or crowd humans. A sick horse may use this maneuver to
keep a veterinarian or other handler away.
 Vocalizing: Horses use a wide assortment of vocalizations to communi-
cate with each other. Some horses also use these vocalizations to 
communicate with their favorite humans. Whinnying (a high-pitched call
similar to a neigh), neighing (the loud call that most people associate with
horses), nickering (a low throaty sound like a chuckle), and squealing (a
short, shrill sound) are all common equine vocalizations. Depending on
the situation, they may be a way of expressing excitement or anxiety.
Horses who are sick rarely vocalize.

Chapter 3: Connecting Your Horse's Behavior to Health

Taking note of daily equine activity
If you live with your horses, you have the opportunity to observe their daily
routines. If a horse is in a pasture with grass and other horses, she spends
her time in the following ways:
 Eating: Horses graze up to 18 hours a day, if food is available. Horses
who are forced to live in small quarters with limited amounts of food
spend much of their time just standing around staring off into space.
Some of them become neurotic and develop stable vices, such as cribbing
and weaving (which we cover later in this chapter). A sick horse often
won’t eat at all.
 Sleeping: A horse who feels safe in her environment may lie down and
get about 15 minutes of REM sleep per day. She also spends a few hours
a day dozing on her feet.
 Interacting: A horse spends a small amount of time grooming another
horse, arguing, or playing.
We cover the basics of sleeping in the following section, and we explain
everything you need to know about feeding your horse in Part II.
Sleeping habits
Yes, horses do sleep standing up. But not always. To get good REM sleep — a
necessity for all mammals — they usually need to lie down. When horses lie
down to sleep, they often recline in a sternal recumbent position, which means
that their legs are tucked underneath them and their chins are resting on the
ground. During this REM period of sleep, their breathing is shallow and their
period of rest is much deeper. (See Figure 3-2 for a horse in the recumbent
position.)
The rest of the horse’s sleep time is actually spent lightly dozing. Using some-
thing called a “stay apparatus,” the horse can remain on her feet while sleeping.
The stay apparatus is an adaptation of the horse’s musculoskeletal system,
and it allows the animal’s limbs to lock in position. Very little muscle function
is required to remain standing. (Chapter 10 has full details on a horse’s
musculoskeletal system.)
A sick horse may sleep more or less than a healthy horse, depending on what
kind of health problem the horse is experiencing.

Regular exercise
Mother Nature built the horse for nearly constant movement. If you watch
horses grazing in a pasture, you see that with just about every bite of grass,
horses take a step. In a short amount of time, the horses move quite a few
feet from where they were originally nibbling.
For horses to stay healthy, regular movement is mandatory. Your horse
releases energy when she moves around the pasture, even if it’s slowly.
Prevent a horse from moving and you have a horse with pent-up energy. You
also have the potential for leg issues because joints, tendons, and ligaments
aren’t moving as they should. Gut motility is also dependent on movement,
so horses who move more are less prone to colic.
For the horse who must live in small quarters without the freedom to move
around and graze, daily exercise is of vital importance. Confined equines need
to be taken out of their stalls and allowed as much time as possible to move
around freely. They also need to be ridden. Confined horses are much more
likely to become colicky than horses who are allowed ample turnout. The
amount of turnout time that a horse needs varies from one individual horse to
another. If horses don’t have the opportunity to release energy, they often express
their anxiousness through misbehavior or neurotic vices. Flip to Chapter 5 for
more info about different types of equine exercise.

Chapter 3: Connecting Your Horse's Behavior to Health

Sick horses are often depressed and lethargic and may not want to exercise
or interact. Some horses become anxious when they’re in pain, however, and
may be more hyper than usual.
Detecting and Fixing Behavior Problems
Horses bring incredible joy to the people around them, but they can also cause
problems. Like young toddlers who can’t speak, sometimes horses can express
themselves only by “acting out.” The result is that horses can present a whole
variety of behavior problems, each with its own cause.
Finding out what’s causing your horse’s behavior problem is the first step in
fixing it. In many cases, horses misbehave because they don’t feel well, either
mentally or physically.
Understanding why horses misbehave
Imagine having a job that requires you to work no matter how badly you feel.
Even if you have a headache, a backache, or the flu, you have to go into work
and put in time doing physical work, regardless of your comfort level. At some
point, you’d rebel and start protesting your situation.
Now imagine living in a tiny apartment all day with your only stimulation and
exercise coming once a day, or less, when you’re allowed to leave the apartment
and do something besides look at four walls. Before too long, you’d develop a
bad attitude about life, and maybe even became neurotic.
Both of these situations reflect the reality of life for many horses. Because they
can’t protest uncomfortable situations verbally the way humans can, horses
take to expressing their emotions in more demonstrative (and possibly
destructive) ways. Your task as an equine caretaker is to figure out what’s
going with your horse’s body or mental state and rectify it the best you can,
on your own, or with a trainer or veterinarian.
Checking out common misbehaviors
Misbehaviors in the horse world can come in one of two forms: acting out
behavior and neurotic behavior. Either type of behavior can be the result of
emotional angst, while acting out is sometimes the result of physical pain.
Neurotic behavior has health implications as well as the capability to drive
horse owners crazy.
44
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

A bad attitude
A sour attitude is the most common expression of unhappiness in a horse
who’s suffering either physically or mentally. Here’s a list of some things
horses typically do to express their pain or anxiety:
 Aggression: If your horse becomes nasty toward you, whether it’s when
you’re feeding him, when you’re tacking him up, when you’re leading him,
or when you’re riding him, suspect some kind of physical discomfort.
Coauthor Audrey once met a horse who started lunging aggressively at
her young owner shortly after being moved to a new training stable. When
the horse was removed from the facility and brought somewhere else, the
behavior stopped. The new trainer determined that the horse wasn’t
being fed enough at the old facility and was literally starving all the time.
This made her incredibly aggressive over her food.
Horses can also become aggressive if you tack them up with ill-fitting
saddles or ride them when they have a sore back. Horses who are
uncomfortable when being ridden produce specific misbehaviors (like
the ones we mention here), or may just have an aggressive expression.
 Bucking: Some horses buck because they’re lazy and don’t want to be
ridden. Others buck because they have excess energy or just poor training.
Still others buck because they’re experiencing pain somewhere in their
body, and being ridden hurts. The pain is often in the back, legs, or neck.
 Evading capture: If your horse turns tail and runs when you try to catch
him, he may be unhappy about what happens to him after you take him
out of his pasture or paddock. He may experience pain when being ridden,
and evading capture is his way of protesting. The pain may be in the back,
legs, or neck.
 Rearing: In most cases, rearing is a bad habit that develops when a
horse is poorly trained or has learned that this behavior can intimidate
the rider. But sometimes horses rear because they’re in pain, either due
to a poorly fitted saddle or to problems in their mouths due to poor
dental care.
 Refusing to move: Horses can refuse to move if they’re in pain —
although some do it simply because they’re lazy and poorly trained.
Coauthor Audrey once knew a horse whose feet were so sore from a bad
trim that he refused to move when a rider got on his back. He knew that
he was going to be uncomfortable after the trotting and cantering
started, and he wouldn’t budge as a result. A horse who won’t move may
feel pain in his legs, hooves, back, neck, or another area of the body.
45
Chapter 3: Connecting Your Horse's Behavior to Health

 Spooking: All horses spook. It’s a fact of life. But some horses spook a
lot more than others, at different times of their lives. Spooking may indi-
cate pain in the back. Coauthor Audrey’s horse Milagro, who’s normally a
very calm boy, started spooking a lot all of a sudden. She had him seen
by a veterinarian, who referred him to an equine physical therapist. The
physical therapist said that he had a lot of tension — and probably pain —
in his back muscles as a result of a fall he’d had in the round pen. After a
series of therapeutic massages, his calm personality returned.
Neurotic Nellies
On the scale of neurosis, horses can develop the following stable vices. A
tendency to form one of these unpleasant habits is sometimes hereditary or
just inherent in a particular horse’s nature when the animal is under stress:
 Bolting feed: Horses who bolt their feed eat too quickly. They do this
when they’re overly hungry, anxious about another horse taking their
food away, or simply anxious in general. When a horse bolts his feed, he
doesn’t chew it thoroughly. This may result in an esophageal or intestinal
blockage.
 Cribbing: A bizarre but all-too-common habit, cribbing seems to be the
equine version of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The cribbing horse
grabs a fence post or barn door between his teeth, arches his neck,
tenses up his neck and facial muscles, retracts his larynx, and sucks air
into his stomach. This air sucking creates an endorphin release that
becomes addictive. Cribbing is a sign of extreme boredom, and it can
also damage the horse’s front teeth.
 Pacing: Pacing horses walk endlessly around in their stalls. Most horses
who pace live in box stalls, although some horses in paddocks pace, too,
especially if they’re anxious. This can eventually cause damage to the
horse’s legs.
 Weaving: When a horse weaves, he stands in one place and shifts weight
from one foot to the other in a rhythmic motion, back and forth, his
head swaying from side to side. Weaving is a sign of extreme boredom or
anxiety. This habit can be hard on the horse’s front legs.
 Wind sucking: This vice is similar to cribbing. The horse takes hold of a
horizontal surface between his teeth, flexes his neck, and gulps air in as
he emits a grunting sound. Or, he may suck air into his windpipe without
taking hold of something with his teeth. Horses who learn to wind suck
seem to be very bored and probably don’t have enough roughage to eat
throughout the day. A lack of roughage can lead to colic, as well as wind
sucking.

Handling a naughty horse
You must handle horses with bad behaviors carefully. Your first priority is to
keep yourself safe. Your horse may seriously injure you, even without meaning
to, regardless of what’s causing the behavior. Stay on guard when you’re around
a badly behaving horse, and consider getting help from a professional trainer.
If your horse exhibits a bad attitude on a regular basis — especially if the
behavior has suddenly developed — have him checked out by an equine vet-
erinarian. If he gets a clean bill of health, he may have a training issue, which
requires assistance from a professional horse trainer. Even better, find a
board-certified veterinary behaviorist to help you with your horse’s problem.
You can find one of these experts by contacting the Animal Behavior Society.
(See the appendix for contact information.)
Horses with neurotic behaviors are a lot tougher to deal with. Their behav-
iors may not be dangerous to you (except for the fact that it drives you nuts
to watch), but they’re harmful to the horse. Your best bet is to provide your
horse with the most natural environment possible to help relieve the bore-
dom and frustration that undoubtedly led to the vice in the first place. In the
cases of weaving, bolting feed, and pacing, a natural environment can do
wonders. Unfortunately, neurotic behaviors such as cribbing and wind suck-
ing are a lot harder to cure after they’ve taken hold. In fact, in most horses,
they’re impossible to fix.

In This Chapter
 Working well with your equine veterinarian
 Providing good housing
 Caring for your horse’s body and feet
 Controlling pests and parasites
A
n ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It’s a cliché, but one
that bears repeating, especially when it comes to horses. When these
large animals get sick, it’s no fun for them or their owners. Taking good care
of your horse to keep her healthy is your most important task as an owner.
In this chapter, we tell you how to help your veterinarian work to keep your
horse in good health. You also discover the best living situations for your
horse, as well as how to groom, care for hooves, and keep parasites at bay.
Working with Your Vet 
to Ensure Good Care
Next to you, your horse’s greatest ally is her veterinarian. He or she is the
one to monitor your horse’s condition if a problem arises, and is there to
administer treatment if your horse needs it.
More so than cat or dog owners, horse owners work very closely with their
equine companions’ veterinarians. Your horse’s vet relies on you to keep a
close watch over your horse’s health, make appointments when necessary
for evaluation and diagnosis, and comply with treatment after it’s prescribed.

In the following sections, we explain how to select a great vet for your horse,
pay for the vet’s care without breaking the bank, and get an all-important
annual exam for your horse.
Decisions, decisions: Choosing a vet
Finding a good horse vet — or a new vet, if you’re looking to make a change —
isn’t hard if you know how to look. And finding a good horse vet is important.
Just like human doctors, veterinarians come in different packages. Some have
great bedside manner, some are great diagnosticians. Some are simply better
doctors than others. It’s up to you to find the professional you most want to
work with. The steps in the following sections can help you find a good vet
for your horse.
Although your horse may be healthy right now, don’t wait until something
goes wrong before you go looking for a vet. An emergency isn’t the time to
start interviewing potential doctors — especially if the problem strikes in the
middle of the night. Having a vet lined up before your horse officially needs
one is good pre-planning, and will pay off most when you need help.
Ask for referrals
If at all possible, work only with a veterinarian who has a special interest in
equine care. Equine veterinarians have chosen to work exclusively with horses
(and sometimes with donkeys and mules too), and are specially trained to
diagnose and treat equine illnesses. They have much more knowledge of horse
issues than their small animal counterparts. At the very least, if you can’t find
a veterinarian in your area who deals only with equines, make sure that the
vet you choose has at least moderate experience with horses.
In order to locate a good horse vet, you need to do a little research. Don’t
pick your horse’s vet from the phone book — use referrals as your best
source for names.
The most important way to find out who the best horse vets are in your area
is through other horse owners. Ask people who have horses which vets they
prefer and why. Ask questions about why they like these particular doctors.
Do they have good bedside manner? Do they have an area of special interest,
such as lameness or dentistry? Find out the doctors’ strong points and
narrow your search down to one or two who appeal to you.
In addition to asking other horse owners for opinions, talk to trainers, breeders,
and farriers. Anyone in the horse business in your area should have opinions
about the best vets in town. You can also contact the American Association of
Equine Practitioners (AAEP), which can provide a list of member horse
veterinarians in your area. (See the appendix for AAEP contact information.)
50
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Interview the vet
After you have a veterinarian’s name or two, get on the phone and start asking
questions. In most cases, you get a receptionist or answering service when
you call. Tell the person you speak to that you’re thinking of becoming a new
client, and find out whether you can talk to the veterinarian. Find out how long
he or she has been practicing; whether he or she has any areas of special
interest — and what they are; and what he or she charges for routine 
procedures, farm visits, and emergency calls. Find out where the vet will refer
your horse in the event the animal needs hospitalization or major surgery.
After you make contact with the vet over the phone or in person, don’t be afraid
to ask about training and credentials, especially if you’re seeking a vet trained
in acupuncture and chiropractic, or any other type of alternative medicine.
(See Chapter 14 for more information about alternative medicine.)
If it’s time for your horse to get vaccinations or have other preventative care
performed, make an appointment with the vet to have those things done so
that you can see how he or she handles your horse — and you — while also
getting in your interview. If your horse is up-to-date on shots and doesn’t
need any particular care right now, schedule a wellness exam so that you can
meet the vet while also getting your horse a professional once-over. (We dis-
cuss checkups and vaccinations in more detail later in this chapter.)
When talking to the veterinarian, be sure to ask what he or she does for emer-
gencies. Some vets are on call 24/7 and you can always reach them, even in
the middle of the night. Other vets refer emergencies to another veterinarian,
or to an equine hospital. Make sure that the vet’s emergency policies are to
your liking.
Make a decision
Ultimately, the vet you choose to be your horse’s medical care professional
should be someone you’re comfortable with. This person should have good
bedside manner and should be able and willing to explain complex situations
to you in easy-to-understand terms. The vet should also show a strong interest
in your horse’s well-being, as well as your horse’s behavior and training, and
your personal goals with the horse. The vet should also be accessible day
and night, either directly or through an answering or referral service.
No matter how impressive a vet’s credentials, it’s more important that the
person really cares about you and your horse. A vet who truly cares refers
your horse to a specialist when necessary, goes the distance to find answers
to difficult problems, and constantly seeks knowledge and further training to
improve his or her services to you and your horse. Your vet should provide
you with information on the risks and benefits of any and all treatments and
procedures, and should explain costs as well. A good vet is willing to recommend
the best course of treatment for your horse given your financial and lifestyle
circumstances.
51
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

If you make a decision and ultimately decide that you don’t like the services
you’re given, don’t hesitate to switch veterinarians. Just make sure that
you’re being fair to your vet and discuss any problems or issues with him or
her before you seek out a different professional.
Covering healthcare costs right off the bat
One of the most difficult areas of horse ownership is paying for healthcare
costs when your horse gets sick. Horses are big animals, and their veterinary
bills are often large in stature as well.
Many unfortunate horse owners have had to make painful decisions to eutha-
nize a sick horse because they couldn’t afford the treatment. You can avoid
this heartbreaking dilemma if you plan ahead by using some or all of the info
in the following sections.
Setting up a savings plan
One way that smart horse owners deal with the potential for high veterinary
costs is to create a savings plan for their equines. By putting money aside for
a rainy day (or, in this case, a serious horse ailment), they wisely provide
themselves with peace of mind.
To know how much money to put aside for an illness — or even for routine
care — talk to your vet. Find out how much colic surgery costs in your area,
because that’s often the greatest expense a horse owner faces. Then, get a
schedule of associated costs for the yearly routine care that your horse will
need. This care includes vaccinations, deworming, dentistry, and a Coggins
test (which checks for equine infectious anemia), as well as health certificates
if you plan to travel with your horse. After you have this information, figure
out how much you need to put away each week or each month. Set the money
aside in an interest-bearing, easy-access account, and add an extra 25 percent
buffer just in case.
Having a credit card as a back-up plan, dedicated only to costly emergencies
like a colic surgery, isn’t a bad idea. Coauthor Dr. Kate knows a number of
horse owners who use this tactic, and it’s made the difference between life
and death for their horse when an expensive, unexpected crisis has occurred.
Buying horse insurance
Another good way to be prepared for an equine health issue is to purchase
horse insurance. Believe it or not, a number of insurance companies offer
major medical insurance for horses. A policy like this can be a literal lifesaver
in the event of a catastrophic illness. You can find equine insurance compa-
nies by checking the advertising in local and national horse publications, or
ask your veterinarian for a suggestion.
52
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Where horses are concerned, major medical policies — which require a single
premium paid once a year, determined by the declared monetary value of the
horse — typically cover costs such as diagnostic procedures, surgery, med-
ication, and visits by a veterinarian associated with an illness or injury. Each
incident has a deductible, which is usually determined by the insurance com-
pany. (It’s unlikely that you’ll get to choose this amount the way you can with
a human health insurance policy.) In many cases, you must supply a veterinary
health certificate to the insurance company to prove that your horse has no
preexisting conditions.
Major medical insurance for horses does have a drawback. Age restrictions
almost always apply, and it’s rare if not impossible to find a policy that will
cover a horse who’s 15 or older. Because most serious illnesses happen to
horses in the senior category, discovering that your horse is too old to be
covered can be frustrating.
A slightly less expensive alternative to major medical insurance for horses is
a surgical-only policy. Surgical-only policies cover your horse’s expenses only
as they relate to surgical care. Because equine surgeries tend to be expensive
(anesthetizing and operating on an animal this big isn’t easy), many owners
opt for this type of insurance because of the lower premium.
If you take out a major medical policy or a surgical-only policy, you’re also
required to have full mortality coverage on the horse. This type of insurance
pays out if the horse dies due to illness or accident, and usually pays the
estimated or declared value of the horse. Technically, major medical and
surgical-only policies are considered riders to a full mortality policy. You
can’t purchase them separately.
Joining a clinic-based HMO
Many veterinary clinics are creating their own healthcare plans as a service
to their clients, and as a way to make sure that horses get the routine and
preventative care that they need. These plans also provide a savings to the
owner. Veterinary HMOs work by having the client pay, in advance, a fee that
covers all routine veterinary care for the coming year. These services usually
include vaccinations, deworming, and dentistry. The fee is less than it would
be if you had the services administered one at a time.
Not all veterinarians offer this service, but it’s a good idea to ask whether
your vet has such a plan. If your vet does offer an HMO, ask him or her to
give you details of the plan in writing so that you know the specifics of the
coverage.
53
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

Getting an annual checkup for your horse
Most people realize the value of going to the doctor for a wellness exam
every year. It’s a good time to touch base with your doctor and make sure
that everything is in working order.
Horses need annual physical exams too, especially if they’re on the younger
or older side. (But unlike humans, who have to go to the doctor’s office for an
exam, the vet usually makes a house call to see your horse.) Making an
appointment once a year to have your horse checked out is a good idea. As
with humans, most horse health problems are much easier to fix if they’re
caught early. In the following sections, we walk you through the phases of a
typical exam.
Your horse’s health history
The first thing your vet does when he examines your horse is ask about her
health over the past year. Has the horse shown any signs of illness or injury?
Have you seen any lameness, weight gain, or weight loss? What about perfor-
mance? Is your horse behaving as well under saddle as she has in the past?
The answers that you provide to these questions help your veterinarian
determine whether trouble may be brewing somewhere in your horse’s health.
For this reason, it’s important to pay close attention to your horse’s behavior
so that you have useful information to pass along to your vet. Flip to Chapter
3 for information on observing your horse’s behavior and linking it to her health.
The physical exam
Next, your vet gives your horse the once-over. He performs the following
steps during the physical exam:
 Eye exam: Your vet looks into your horse’s eyes, using a light source.
He’s looking for corneal scarring, cataracts, inflammation, and other
signs of disease.
 Gut sounds: Your vet checks to see whether your horse’s digestive
system is working well. Using a stethoscope, he listens to the sounds
coming from the horse’s gastrointestinal system.
 Heart and lungs: The vet listens to your horse’s heart and lungs with a
stethoscope.
 Tooth check: Your vet examines your horse’s mouth for missing teeth,
overgrown molars, and poor alignment.
 Vital signs: The vet checks out basic life functions, including temperature,
respiration, and pulse while at rest (see Chapter 2 for details on these
functions). After some light exercise, your vet may check these again.
Abnormal readings are sometimes a way to detect illness.
54
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

After this exam, your vet will have a good sense of how well your horse is
feeling overall and how her body is functioning.
Blood work
If you want your vet to get an even more complete picture of what’s going on
with your horse, you can have him run a complete blood panel; this way, you
get an idea of the general internal health of your horse. This test requires taking
blood from the horse’s jugular vein and sending it out to a lab for analysis.
With a blood test, your vet can get an overview on how well some of your
horse’s organs are working. He can get a picture of your horse’s liver and
kidney function, as well an accurate count of how your horse’s immune system
is working at that time. You can also request a thyroid evaluation and other
tests. Discuss the options with your veterinarian and see what he suggests.
Vaccinations
A host of infectious diseases (like the ones described in Chapter 12) are lurking
in the environment, ready to compromise your horse’s health at any moment.
Vaccines are the best way to protect your horse from some of the most
deadly of these infections. Regular vaccination is particularly important if
your horse is exposed to other horses by going to shows or living in a boarding
stable (we talk about stables later in this chapter).
Here are basic vaccines that are needed in most parts of the country:
 Equine encephalomyelitis: Western equine encephalomyelitis 
(WEE), Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), and Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE) are three strains of the same encephalomyelitis
illness. They’re known to infect horses through the bite of a mosquito.
This disease attacks the central nervous system and can cause severe
neurological symptoms and even death. This vaccine is given at least
once a year (more often to pregnant mares and foals).
 Influenza/rhinopneumonitis: These two respiratory illnesses have similar
symptoms. Influenza can sometimes cause neurological disease, and
abortions in pregnant mares. Some veterinarians recommend that horses
be inoculated with flu/rhino vaccine as frequently as every three months
to avoid respiratory conditions. (No vaccines are currently approved to
prevent the neurological form of the virus.) Some vets may recommend it
only once or twice a year if the horse is at low risk of exposure.
 Tetanus: Tetanus is contracted through open wounds. This bacterial 
disease can cause serious symptoms and even death. Horses are particu-
larly susceptible to tetanus, so veterinarians recommend an inoculation
of tetanus toxoid at least once a year.
55
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

 West Nile virus: This virus has been in the news a lot over the last few
years. Humans, birds, and horses are most susceptible to it. Spread by
mosquitoes, it attacks the nervous system. Horses who contract this
disease can become permanently damaged, and death often results.
Some vets inoculate twice a year for this illness, others just once a year.
The series of vaccinations that your horse needs each year depends largely on
where in the country you live, the horse’s age, her environment, your travel
plans with her, and her health history. Many vaccines require several boosters
to be given periodically after the initial vaccine, and then annual or semiannual
boosters. The horse’s vaccination history can help your equine veterinarian
advise you correctly on this aspect of your horse’s routine healthcare. Certain
illnesses are more common in different places in the country, and vets are more
vigilant about giving particular vaccines in those areas.
The frequency with which your veterinarian recommends vaccination depends
on the vaccine, your region of the country, and your veterinarian’s attitude
toward vaccines in general. See the nearby sidebar “Vaccinate with care” for
more details.

Vaccinate with care
Although vaccinations are necessary to keep
your horse healthy, a trend has developed away
from over-vaccination. Veterinarians are now
much more interested in providing individual-
ized vaccine programs versus “flock-shooting”
all horses and vaccinating for everything sev-
eral times each year. Many veterinarians have
become concerned in recent years that over-
vaccinating causes immune-related problems
in the long term.
If you’re concerned about over-vaccinating, ask
your veterinarian to check vaccine titers (a mea-
surement of specific antibodies in the blood) to
see whether an adequate level of protection
already exists. (Keep in mind that checking titers
may prove to be more costly than giving the vac-
cine again.) If the titers show that the horse has
adequate protection, discuss with your vet the
possibility of skipping the vaccine this time
around, and possibly using it next time instead.
Another issue of concern is giving too many
vaccines at once. If possible, try to spread out
your horse’s vaccines so that you’re not giving
too many antigens (the element in vaccines that
prompt the body to produce protective antibod-
ies) at one time. Remember, all a vaccination
does is ask the horse’s body to start producing
immunity to that particular disease. A horse who’s
stressed at the time of vaccine administration, or
soon thereafter, may not respond by producing a
sufficient amount of immunity to ward off that par-
ticular disease. Though one scientific study has
shown otherwise, too many vaccines adminis-
tered at one time may be too much of a stress on
the horse to achieve adequate immunity to all the
diseases. Ask your vet to devise a schedule that
spreads out your horse’s yearly vaccination pro-
gram over several visits.

Housing Your Horse Safely 
and Comfortably
If your horse lived in the wild, all the world would be his home. Wild horses
roam far and wide every day, searching for the best plants to eat. They can
cover as many as 20 miles a day, rarely staying in the same area for very long.
Domestic horses are in a completely different situation. Unlike their feral
brethren, they’re forced to live in confinement. Their physical and mental
health can suffer under these conditions if their owners don’t manage things
right. It’s your job as a horse owner to do what you can to make their living
arrangements as natural and pleasant as can be, using the guidelines in the
following sections. (For even more details on housing your horse, see Horses
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by coauthor Audrey with Janice Posnikoff,
DVM, and published by Wiley.)
Telling the difference between 
different types of enclosures
Whether you board your horse at a stable or keep your horse at home (see
the following section), three basic types of enclosures are available:
 Pasture: The most natural setting for a horse is in a pasture, because it
mimics conditions in the wild. The horse can walk around and eat all
day, the way he would in nature. If you have the option of boarding your
horse in such a setting, you’re more likely to have a happy horse. Your
horse is less likely to develop stable vices (see Chapter 3 for details on
these), digestive problems, and lameness if he has access to a pasture.
Just be sure that the pasture is able to maintain the number of horses
being kept on it, and that your horse is able to get along with the other
horses. (See Chapter 7 for more details on pastures.)
 Paddock: The next best thing to a pasture is a paddock, and the bigger
the better. A paddock is a large enclosure that doesn’t include pasture
grass. Horses love to be outside, because it feels most natural to them.
They enjoy being around other horses and seeing the comings and going
of everyone at the stable. Horses kept in large paddocks are healthier of
mind and less prone to digestive and lameness issues than horses who
are kept in stalls.
57
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

 Box stalls: Box stalls are the least natural enclosure choice for a horse.
The horse is kept indoors (except in cases where the box stall has an
outdoor run attached), and doesn’t have direct contact with other horses.
Many people think that they’re doing their horse a favor by keeping him
in a plush box stall filled with shavings and out of the weather, but in
truth horses like to be outdoors in the dirt. Humans are the ones who
prefer to live indoors!
Horses need a box stall only if you need to confine them for some reason,
or if the weather is inclement and they have no other option for shelter.
You may need to confine your horses when they recoup from a health
problem or give birth (although some people, like coauthor Dr. Kate,
prefer their mares to foal outside).
The big question: Boarding stables 
versus home accommodations
Whether to keep your horse at a boarding stable or at home is often a decision
that’s determined by where you live. If you can’t keep a horse at your home,
you’re pretty much restricted to keeping him at a boarding stable (unless you
have a friend or neighbor with private horse property). If you have your own
horse property, you may want to keep your horse at home, and with good
reason. Having your horse with you is rewarding, and it gives you more
control over your horse’s feeding and general care.
Boarding stables
Horse owners who aren’t fortunate enough to own their own horse property —
or who don’t want the day-to-day tasks of caring for a horse — rely on the
services of boarding stables. Boarding stables are commercial facilities that
provide housing and limited care for clients’ horses. They earn their income
from the fees paid by horse owners every month.
Accommodations at boarding stables vary greatly by facility and region. Some
provide large pastures where you can keep your horse in the most natural
setting possible. Others have paddocks that are either fairly large or rather
small. Many provide box stalls, small enclosures that keep your horse constantly
indoors (see the earlier section, “Telling the difference between different
types of enclosures,” for details).
You can find boarding stables advertised in your local equine publication, in
the newspaper, or on the Internet. You can also ask other horse owners in
your area where they board.
58
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

When choosing a boarding stable, keep the following points in mind to ensure
that your horse stays happy and healthy:
 Clean, safe accommodations: Make sure that enclosures are clean, well
constructed, and well maintained; if you see days’ worth of manure piled
up and/or you get a strong smell of urine, find a different place to board.
Gate latches must be secure and horse-proof. Avoid stables that use barbed
wire, and make sure that pasture boarding provides shelter.
 Clean, safe surroundings: Avoid boarding at a run-down facility with
junk lying around. This environment isn’t safe, healthy for your horse, or
pleasant for you. Also, if management doesn’t take care of the property,
they probably won’t take good care of your horse either.
 Clean, fresh water: Inspect the facility and make sure that each horse at
the stable has a generous supply of water at all times. If you live in a
cold climate, find out what method the facility uses for keeping water
from freezing in the winter.
 Good security: Your horse is safest at a stable with 24-hour security. Not
all boarding stables provide this kind of protection, but it’s a definite
bonus if you can find one.
 Quality feed: If you’re pasture boarding, make sure that the grass is of
good quality, and that it’s not overgrazed. (See Chapter 9 for more infor-
mation on growing quality pastures.) If your horse will be eating hay, make
certain that it’s of good quality. Inspect it, using Chapter 7 as a guide.
If grain is stored on the property, be sure that it’s kept securely locked
up so that the horses can’t get to it. Any escaped horse who gets into
the grain is in danger of becoming colicky or developing laminitis. (See
Chapter 11 for more information on these problems.)
Use caution with stables that feed only commercial pelleted feed with no
other options. A diet consisting solely of pellets and no, or minimal,
roughage (in other words, no hay or pasture) is unhealthy for your
horse. If a stable that you like feeds only pelleted feed as part of your
regular boarding agreement, make sure that it agrees to feed your horse
hay if you provide it.
 Good care: Get details on what kind of daily care your horse will
receive. Your horse’s stall should be cleaned at least once a day, every
day. Your horse should be fed at least twice daily. Find out what kinds of
pest control management is in place. You want to be sure that flies and
rodents are being kept under control. (We discuss pest control in more
detail later in this chapter.)
 Health requirements: Horses being boarded at the facility should be
required to be up-to-date on inoculations. The particular inoculations may
be different from what your vet recommends. If this is the case, discuss
the situation with your veterinarian to find out whether she thinks that you
should have your horse vaccinated for these illnesses. If not, discuss
your vet’s opinion with the stable management.
59
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

 Professional behavior: Be prepared to sign injury liability waivers and a
boarding agreement, and to fill out other official papers stating the name
of your veterinarian and a person to contact in case of an emergency.
Management should also provide you with written rules of the stable. Be
wary of any boarding stable that has an overly casual attitude about your
boarding agreement. They may also have an overly casual attitude about
caring for your horse.
After your horse is moved to a boarding stable, contact your veterinarian and
make arrangements that your horse be cared for in case of an emergency when
you can’t be reached. Notify the boarding stable of your vet’s emergency
number. Provide a backup vet’s phone number just in case your regular vet 
is unavailable.
Accommodations at home
Having your horse at home can be a wonderful experience — as well as a lot
of work. To keep your horse happy and healthy, you need to provide the right
care and accommodations to your equine companion.
Before you can bring your horse home (if you’re a brand-new owner or if you’re
moving your horse from a boarding stable), make sure that your accommoda-
tions are ready:
 Your horse should have a pasture or paddock with shelter or a stall. (We
describe these enclosures earlier in this chapter.)
 Water should be available at all times, either through an automatic
waterer or from a minimum 30-gallon (per horse) large pail or trough
that’s refilled daily. (See Chapter 6 for more information.)
 Find a good supplier where you can get your hay. (If your horse is on
quality pasture, you may not need to feed hay, or you may need to feed
hay only during the times of the year when the pasture is inadequate.
See Chapter 9 for details on growing good pasture.) Order as much hay
as you can store or afford to buy at once. Be sure to keep your hay in a
covered shelter, protected from rain and snow. Chapter 7 has all the info
you need to keep your horse well fed.
Develop a daily routine for your horse to ensure his proper care. This routine
should include the following:
 Feeding: If your horse is in a pasture, he can eat to his heart’s content,
and if your pasture is good quality, you don’t have to worry about feeding
him unless you’re giving him supplements to his grass diet. (See Chapter 7
for information on how to judge whether your pasture is good quality, and
Chapter 8 for details on dietary supplements.) If your horse is in a paddock
or stall, feed him at least twice a day or more. (The quantity of food can
remain the same, but the greater the frequency, the better.)
60
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Watering: Your horse needs fresh water every day. Horses drink as
much as 20 gallons of water a day. If you don’t have an automatic
waterer, you need to fill your horse’s water bucket or trough daily.
 Cleaning: Clean your horse’s stall or paddock of manure at least once a
day, more often if you can in warm weather. The less manure in the 
environment, the fewer flies you have.
 Grooming: Take your horse out of his stall, paddock, or pasture at least
once a day to give him a daily grooming and hoof cleaning (we explain
how to do these tasks later in this chapter).
 Exercise: If your horse is in a paddock or stall, provide him with exercise
every day. Even a 20-minute hand-walk is better than no exercise at all.
See Chapter 5 for the basics of exercising your horse.
Grooming Your Horse
Part of your routine should be to groom your horse. The benefits of grooming,
including daily brushing, regular bathing, and occasional clipping (if you
choose), are plentiful:
 Grooming not only keeps your horse looking pretty, but it also provides
your horse with much needed attention and strengthens the bond between
you; you help your horse feel loved and cared for, which goes a long way
toward keeping her healthy.
 Grooming gives you a chance to examine your horse’s body for abnor-
malities; if you groom daily, you’re more likely to notice changes or
problems as they arise.
 Grooming works to remove sweat and dirt from your horse’s coat, helping
keep her skin clean and healthy. A well-groomed coat is less prone to
chafing and skin irritation.
Brushing your horse
Brushing your horse can be a therapeutic activity for both you and your
equine companion. Use the following steps to create a routine for your
grooming sessions:
1. Bring dirt to the surface of your horse’s coat by rubbing it with a
rubber currycomb, using a circular motion.
2. Dissipate the dirt you brought to the surface by brushing in short
strokes with a stiff brush in the direction of the coat (see Figure 4-1).
61
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

3. Remove the remaining dust from the coat by using a soft brush,
moving along the lay of the coat with short strokes.
4. Wipe down the horse’s body with a cloth (a clean rag will do).
5. Clean out the insides of your horse’s nostrils with the cloth.
Dirt and mucus tends to accumulate there.
6. Gently groom your horse’s face and head with long strokes of the soft
brush.
7. Pick out shavings, burrs, or other foreign material lodged in the
mane, tail, or forelock with your fingers.
8. Use your fingers to separate tangles in the mane and tail.
You may need to add mane and tail detangler, available at tack stores,
for this step.
9. Groom the base of the horse’s tail with a soft brush.
10. Groom the base of the mane with the soft brush.
11. Brush out the hair of the mane and tail with a soft brush, gently
removing any tangles with your fingers.
While you’re brushing your horse, keep a lookout for areas that may be
swollen or abraded. This is the best time to spot a problem on your horse’s
body before it becomes more serious.

Bathing your horse
Horses need baths on a regular basis, and it’s not surprising when you think
about it. After all, they spend most of their lives in the dirt!
Dust and mud are only two elements that need to be washed off during a 
periodic bath. Horses sweat a lot too, especially when ridden. A buildup of
sweat and dirt can cause itchy, irritated skin.
The frequency of your horse’s bathing needs depends on your climate, how
dirty your horse is, and what you use her for. Don’t worry; it’s easy to tell when
a horse is dirty! If you have a show horse, wash her often — and especially
the day before a show — to keep her looking good for competition. Keep in
mind, however, that bathing a horse too often isn’t good because the shampoo
can strip the natural oils from the horse’s skin and coat.
Here are some tips when bathing your horse:
 Wait for warm weather. Don’t wash your horse if the weather is below 60
degrees, or if it’s late in the day and your horse won’t have time to dry
before the temperature drops. If your horse’s skin is wet when the air
gets cold, she’ll become chilled.
 Be sure that your horse is okay with being washed. If you don’t know
whether your horse has ever been bathed before, have someone hold
her and run a garden hose on her legs and shoulder. Gauge her reaction
before you start giving her a full-fledged bath. If she’s nervous about it,
give her a bath anyway but be patient and tell her that she’s a good girl
when she cooperates.
 Choose a good place to bathe your horse. Use a wash rack or area with
a concrete floor for safety, and to keep mud from gathering under your
wet horse.
 Have access to lukewarm water. Washing your horse with ice-cold
water isn’t nice, especially if the weather is on the cooler side. Use a
bucket warmer to heat up cold water before you splash it on your horse.
 Wash your horse’s body. Give your horse a good rubbing all over her
body with a wet, shampoo-laden sponge or cloth. Start on either side at
the neck, and work your way back. After you scrub that entire side of the
horse, rinse thoroughly. When all the soap and dirt are gone, the water
from the hose should run clear. Repeat on the other side of the horse.
 Use shampoo made especially for horses. Shampoo for horses is
designed with the equine coat and skin in mind. Avoid using other types
of shampoo because they can dry out your horse’s skin.
63
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

 Don’t forget to condition and rinse the horse’s mane and tail. Wash the
mane and tail with horse shampoo, and rinse thoroughly before applying
conditioner. Your horse’s hair will look wonderful, and keeping these
areas clean prevents itching and rubbing.
 Remember to wash the horse’s head. Dirt and sweat gather behind
your horse’s ears and along the sides of her face, where her halter and
bridle go. Use warm water to clean these areas and keep your horse free
from itching and chafing (see Figure 4-2).
After you wash your horse, she’s probably going to want to roll in the dirt. To
keep her from turning your hard work into mud, hand-walk her until she’s dry
(see Chapter 5 for more about hand-walking).
Considering clips
Most horses can stand to have some clipping done now and then, just to
neaten them up. Controversy rages over whether clipping a horse is a good
idea, however. Consider the following issues when deciding whether you
want to clip your horse (keep in mind you’ll be doing this yourself, or paying
your trainer to do it):
Figure 4-2:

your horse’s

64
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Whisker shaves: Many people like to clip a horse’s whiskers and trim
the long hair above the eyes. People who show their horses find this
practice to be mandatory. It gives the horse a neat appearance, but
some experts say that it robs her of tools that nature gave her to help
her sense objects near her head and protect her eyes and muzzle from
injury. We prefer that you don’t clip these if you don’t have to.
 Fetlock trims: Trimming the hair on your horse’s fetlocks helps produce
a cleaner, neater look to the legs. Some people believe this hair should
be left in place, however, because it helps water run off the back of the
leg and away from the hoof.
 Body clips: Many horses become wild and wooly in the coat department
come winter. Horses who work hard and have these kinds of coats —
especially in warm climates — end up hotter than they should be and
soaking wet. And they take forever to cool down. The answer is to clip
most of the horse’s hair down so that it’s very short, and then keep her
blanketed in cold weather to make up for the missing coat. Some people
don’t think this is a good idea, however, because it robs the horse of her
natural winter protection.
 Ear buzz: Trimming the long hair out of a horse’s ears gives her a neat,
trim appearance. It also removes her protection against biting insects,
which prey upon the delicate insides of the horse’s ears.
65
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care
Cleaning your horse’s privates
Part of a thorough bathing is cleaning your horse’s
most delicate of areas. On mares, this area is
between the udders. On geldings, it’s the penis. If
these areas become overly dirty, they can become
itchy and start causing your horse to rub and itch.
If you have a mare, the good news is that udders
are fairly easy to clean. Just don a latex glove,
and use a mild soap or gel to remove the waxy
substance that has gathered between the teats.
If you’ve never done this cleaning on your mare
before, stand safely to the side when you first
attempt it. Most mares don’t object to being
cleaned in this area, but some kick out when
they feel you touch them in that delicate spot. If
your mare proves difficult, have your veterinar-
ian clean her when he or she comes out for the
next visit. Some mares need cleaning as often
as every couple of weeks, others every couple
of months.
Geldings are much harder to clean than mares,
mostly because they don’t usually cooperate. The
good news is that you don’t have to do this “sheath
cleaning” every time you bathe your horse. Every
six months to a year is usually enough.
Cleaning this area on your gelding is important
because of something called “the bean,” which
is a pellet of gunk that forms in the pocket at the
end of the penis. This bean comes from a
buildup of secretions, and can cause irritation
and swelling. It needs to be removed either by
you or your vet.
If you’ve never cleaned your gelding’s sheath,
have a veterinarian do it the first time. Your horse
may not appreciate your attempts at cleaning this
very private area and could kick you. Chances are
your vet will give your horse a shot of sedative
before he or she even attempts to do this clean-
ing, just to make sure that no one gets hurt.

Whether you ultimately decide to clip your horse — and how much you choose
to clip — is your decision. If you show your horse, you’re expected to clip her to
some degree. (Some breeds are heavily clipped, while others need just a light
trim.) Be aware of any potential health issues that may arise for your horse as a
result of a clip and work with your vet to minimize these problems.
Taking Care of Your Horse’s Hooves
Caring for your horse’s hooves is one of your most important tasks as a
horse owner. Without good hoof care from you and a trustworthy farrier,
your horse won’t be able to stay sound and healthy.
Cleaning the hooves yourself
It’s vital that you keep your horse’s feet clear of manure and packed debris to
avoid a fungal infection called thrush. Follow these steps to properly clean
your horse’s hooves:
1. Start at the left side of the horse, with the front leg.
2. Put a hoof pick in your dominant hand with the handle in your fist
and the point of the pick facing away from you.
3. Ask your horse for his hoof; when he gives it to you, hold it so that the
bottom of the hoof is facing upward, and begin to clean the underside
with the hoof pick.
4. Clean out the areas around the triangular frog of the hoof.
Look for rocks, nails, and other items that may be lodged around the frog
(see Figure 4-3).
5. Use a hoof brush to wipe away excess dirt on the sole of the foot.
This step allows you a good view of the foot, enabling you to see stones
or other objects that may be lodged inside.
6. Repeat this procedure with the rest of the hooves, going to the back
left leg, the front right leg, and then the back right leg.
66
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

Working with a farrier
In the wild, horses wear their feet down naturally as they travel many miles
each day searching for food. (Because they spend so much time on their feet,
horses have hooves that constantly grow.) Horses who live with humans don’t
have the opportunity to trim down their own feet with wear and tear, so they
must rely on farriers to keep their hooves from overgrowing. In the following
sections, we explain how to find a farrier and discuss the work of a farrier:
trimming and shoeing.
What happens at the ground level affects every step your horse takes. Pain or
imbalance in the foot travels up the leg and eventually to the horse’s back.
One bad foot can spoil the entire horse, so don’t skimp on your horse’s hoof
care. Allowing a horse’s hooves to become overgrown, whether he’s shod or
not, is a dangerous game to play. Lameness can easily result, and over time,
may become permanent.
Finding a farrier
Next to you and your vet, the most important person in your horse’s world is
your farrier. To find a good one, ask your vet, trusted colleagues, and others
involved in your particular sport for recommendations.
Figure 4-3:

67
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

The farrier you choose should be knowledgeable and willing to talk to you in
easy-to-understand language. He or she should also be willing to confer with
your vet about your horse’s particular problems.
If the farrier you choose wants to see X-rays of your horse, it’s a good sign. If
your horse has a problem, the farrier may want to see films of your horse’s feet
to better determine the best shoeing procedure. Also, high level performance
horses are often X-rayed on a regular basis for just this purpose.
A good farrier is worth his or her weight in gold. Coauthor Dr. Kate has occa-
sionally recommended a particular shoe or shoeing procedure for a horse
only to have the farrier explain to her why it’s not the best option in that
case. She loves working with real professionals who have her patient’s best
interests at heart.
Trimming and shoeing (if you choose)
The average horse needs to have his feet trimmed once every four to eight
weeks. Horses who wear shoes may need their shoes replaced in the same
amount of time. Have your farrier help you determine the best trimming
and/or shoeing schedule for your horse, and budget that cost. Put that
money into your horse’s savings account if you have one (we discuss setting
up a health savings account for your horse earlier in this chapter).
You may be wondering whether shoes are even necessary for your horse.
Over the last several years, a revolution has taken place in the horse world.
Horses have started kicking off their shoes for good, thanks to a movement
known as “barefoot.” (Check out a barefoot hoof in Figure 4-4.)
Figure 4-4:
Barefoot
trims are

hooves of
wild horses.
68
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

The barefoot movement is based on the notion that horses are meant to go
without shoes. Debate rages over whether or not this is true — after all, horses
have been wearing iron shoes for centuries. Proponents of barefoot believe
that shoes simply aren’t natural and shouldn’t be there. Traditionalists believe
that shoes protect a horse’s hoof from the unnatural activities that humans
ask them to do. The two sides rage on, and horse owners are left wondering
which camp they should be in.
We believe that barefoot is best, whenever possible. Neither one of your
humble authors has ever met a good farrier who recommended shoes unless
it was absolutely necessary. That said, it’s important not to just jump onto
the no-shoes bandwagon without discussing the issue with your veterinarian
and doing research on your own. (You can find resources for barefoot and
other hoof care information in the appendix.)
Ridding Your Horse of 
Pests and Parasites
An important aspect of horse care is keeping small critters from bugging your
horse. Insects and parasites make your horse feel bad, and they can also seri-
ously affect your horse’s health.
Horse-pestering pests come in a variety of shapes and types, and keeping them
in check will keep you on your toes.
Flies and gnats
Flies and gnats are dirty bugs that transmit disease and filth on their feet. Some
also have painful bites that can drive horses completely out of their minds.
Many horses are allergic to fly bites and become very itchy during fly season,
rubbing their manes and tails nearly off their bodies as they frantically scratch
against everything in their environment.
Flies come in an annoying array of species, several of which live to make
horses’ lives miserable. Here are the top culprits when it comes to flies that
like to bother horses:
 Face fly: This disgusting insect feeds on secretions from the horse’s
eyes and nostrils.
 Stable fly: This flying pest draws blood from the horse’s legs with
painful bites.
69
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

 Horsefly: This large fly sucks blood from the horse’s upper body, usually
the withers.
 Black fly: Considered by most to be a gnat, this tiny bug feeds on blood
from the inside of the horse’s ears.
 Botfly: This fly lays its eggs on the horse’s front legs, belly, or hind legs
and waits for the horse to accidentally ingest them when grooming him-
self. When that happens, the horse swallows the eggs, the eggs hatch
inside the digestive tract, and new botflies pass out through the manure.
These parasites are harmful to your horse and can cause stomach
ulcers, as well as other digestive issues.
 Housefly: This common pest lays its eggs directly in the horse’s manure.
The eggs hatch, and the larvae feed and turn into annoying adult flies.
Your job as a horse owner is to keep these bugs at bay the best you can. Here
are options for keeping your horse and stable fly-free:
 Clean manure often. Many flies thrive in dirty environments, and some
lay their eggs in horse manure. By cleaning manure frequently during fly
season, you can do a lot to control the fly population in your horse’s
environment.
 Hang fly traps. Place traps or strips near your horse’s living quarters.
Flies are attracted to these objects and become trapped in or on them.
 Use biological controls. You can find companies that specialize in bio-
logical fly control. These businesses provide regular shipments of a
predatory wasp in the Chalcididae family. This wasp is so tiny that you
won’t even know it’s there. Yet these insects do wonders to keep fly popu-
lations down by feeding on the larvae of flies in the environment.
 Apply fly sprays and wipes. Applying these products to your horse
daily during fly season helps keep your horse relatively pest free. Fly
control wipes and sprays are available in a variety of formulas, and
include everything from all-natural sprays to oil-based chemical wipes.
 Install stall fans. Some horse owners install large fans near the ceilings
of their horse’s stall to keep flies (and mosquitoes) from being able to
land on the horse.
 Utilize fly coverups. You can place fly masks, ear covers, fly sheets, and
leg wraps on horses during fly season to minimize bites.
Be aware that some horses won’t tolerate these coverups and will tear
them off themselves or other horses not long after you put them on.
You’ll never completely rid your horse’s environment of flies and gnats, but
by waging war on these pests, you can keep them to a manageable level.

Mosquitoes
No one likes mosquitoes, least of all horse owners. Not only do these insects
leave itchy bites behind, but they’re also capable of spreading a number of
potentially fatal diseases to horses, including West Nile virus and encephalitis
(see Chapter 12 for more about these diseases).
The best ways to protect your horse from mosquitoes include the following:
 Use repellant. Mosquito repellant for horses is readily available at tack
and feed stores, and it discourages mosquitoes from biting.
 Cover your horse. Sheets designed to keep mosquitoes from biting are
available in different designs and colors.
 Vaccinate your horse. Stay current on vaccines for mosquito-borne dis-
eases to make sure that your horse stays healthy. We discuss vaccinations
in detail earlier in this chapter.
 Debug your property. Eliminate standing water anywhere on your property
where mosquitoes might breed. Put mosquitofish in ponds or large
water troughs. Keep high weeds cut down to discourage mosquitoes
from gathering.
 Hang traps. Mosquito traps are available at hardware and garden stores.
Hang them near your horse’s stall.
 Install fans. Stall fans keep mosquitoes from landing on your horse and
biting.
By being vigilant against mosquitoes, you’ll keep your horse healthy. As a
bonus, you may have fewer itchy bites, too!
Ticks
If you’re a dog owner, you’re probably familiar with ticks, those nasty arachnids
that latch onto an animal’s (or a human’s) skin and suck the blood for nourish-
ment. Ticks go after horses, too, and can easily spread disease. Tick-borne
illnesses that can make your horse very sick include Lyme disease and
encephalitis. (See Chapter 12 for details on these diseases.) That’s why keeping
ticks at bay — and off your horse — is important.
The tick most likely to latch onto your equine companion is the deer tick, a
tiny black bug that lurks in high brush during warm seasons. Although these
ticks especially like horses, and are the ones most likely to carry Lyme disease,
any type of tick can latch onto your horse.
71
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

A nasty creature called the ear tick likes to attach to the horse’s ears. These
pests can cause head and/or ear shyness, as well as bleeding from the ear.
Horses with ear ticks may also hold their ears down, or off to the side.
Sometimes, they rub their ears on anything they can find.
It’s important to keep ticks off your horse to prevent disease. A large infestation
of ticks can also cause anemia, so be vigilant about these pests. To deal with
ticks, follow these guidelines:
 Apply tick repellant. Before riding your horse through wilderness areas,
or if he lives in an area that has tall plants, apply tick repellant to keep
these bugs from latching onto him.
 Groom carefully. When you groom your horse, keep an eye out for ticks
that may have grabbed onto your horse.
Check the ears carefully because it’s a favorite spot for ticks.
 Remove body ticks. Using tweezers, grasp the tick at the base of the
head and use slow, steady upward pressure to pull the creature from
your horse’s body.
Be careful not to squeeze the tick’s body with the tweezers, because it
will re-inject possibly contaminated blood back into the horse. If you fail
to get the tick’s entire head out of the skin, call a veterinarian.
 Clear out ear ticks. If you think that your horse has ear ticks, and the
ear isn’t especially sore, you can take a tissue-wrapped finger and very
gently probe the ear canal in a sweeping motion. If you’re lucky, you’ll
retrieve the nasty little culprits. Be careful not to rigorously dig into your
horse’s ears with your fingers because you’ll drive the ticks deeper into
the canal. (If this tactic doesn’t immediately alleviate the problem, call
your vet.)
Worms
Internal parasites in the form of worms are a huge scourge to horses if they
aren’t properly controlled. A variety of worms prey on horses, and can do
serious and permanent damage to their internal organs if left unchecked.
A worm-infested horse is a sorry sight to see. A dull, ratty looking coat and an
underweight appearance are sure signs of worm infestation. Although 150
species of internal parasites can cause harm to horses, the most common
ones include:
 Bots: An egg-laying fly (see the earlier section “Flies” in this chapter),
the bot begins as larvae that attaches itself to a horse’s stomach after
being swallowed. The result can be colic.
72
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Pinworms: These worms reside in the horse’s rectum and cause irritation
and discharge. They can prompt a horse to rub the dock of her tail
obsessively.
 Roundworms: Foot-long roundworms are truly disgusting to see. They
live in the digestive tracts and cause horses to become colicky and lose
condition.
 Stongyles: This intestinal parasite uses the horse’s circulatory system to
spread its larvae through the bloodstream. This parasite can cause serious
and permanent damage to the horse’s organs. Recurrent colic can also be a
result of a lack of good blood supply to the intestines. Also, certain stages
of strongyles can encyst in the horse’s intestinal tract and remain there for
long periods of time. This may cause unthriftiness, diarrhea, and colic.
Keeping worms from infecting your horse to some degree is nearly impossible,
but you can control how many worms your horse has with regular deworming.
Several chemical agents are available over the counter, allowing horse owners
to regularly deworm their horses. Or, your vet can deworm your horse for you.
Because worms can develop a resistance to some dewormers, it’s important
to discuss a deworming program with your veterinarian. Your vet can tell you
how to best rotate different types of deworming drugs to avoid resistance,
and how often to deworm your horse, depending on where you live and your
horse’s environment.
Smile Pretty! Caring for 
Your Horse’s Teeth
Your horse needs healthy teeth to chew up all that roughage you’re feeding
him — and that roughage is so important for his digestive health. In order to
keep your horse’s teeth healthy, you need help from your veterinarian.
Wild horses wear their teeth down naturally as they graze on a variety of
different plants in their environment. Domestic horses need help keeping
their teeth in good shape, though, because their diet is different from that 
of wild horses.
Uneven wear on a horse’s teeth results in sharp points that can cut into the
horse’s cheeks. These sharp points can hurt the horse when he chews and
when he wears a bit in his mouth. For this reason, horses need to have their
teeth filed down, or floated, on a regular basis.
73
Chapter 4: Getting Up to Speed on Routine Care

Your equine veterinarian performs this task for you. In most cases, your vet
gives your horse a sedative (to ensure cooperation) and uses a handheld or
power-driven file to grind the points off your horse’s teeth.
Most horses need to have this procedure done about once a year, but your horse
may need it more often depending on his age and particular circumstances.
Coauthor Dr. Kate recommends a dental exam every six to nine month in horses
who are 2 to 5 years old, because horses’ teeth change the most during this
time and around the time a bit is first placed in the mouth.
Your veterinarian should check your horse’s teeth when he or she comes to
inoculate your horse, and can advise you as to your horse’s dental needs.

Exercising for Health
In This Chapter
 Working your way into exercise
 Exploring ways to exercise your horse
 Helping your horse during lay-up
O
ne of the most crucial elements to your horse’s health is exercise. Nature
designed horses to walk almost constantly as they graze, so your horse’s
joints, tendons, and ligaments need movement to keep them in good working
order. Exercise is also good for your horse’s digestive system, and for his
metabolism. Even your horse’s mental health benefits from regular exercise.
In this chapter, we show you the safest ways to exercise your horse. You dis-
cover how to begin and end your horse’s exercise regimen, and how to make
the most of your time spent getting him to move. For horses recovering from
injuries, we provide details on how to help them recuperate with movement.
Starting Safely with Exercise
When it comes to exercise, horses are a lot like people. If you exercise only
occasionally, you wouldn’t start jogging 5 miles a day without building up to
this distance first. Or at least you shouldn’t! The same goes for horses. If your
horse isn’t doing much right now, you need to slowly get him into an exercise
regimen. In addition, each time you exercise your horse, it’s important to warm
him up and cool him down, just as human athletes do. In the following sections,
we take a look at how to safely handle exercising your horse.
Easing into a routine
Horses need to work up to their full exercise potential. If your horse has been
a stall potato for too long and you’ve decided to get serious with his exercise,
don’t go hog wild and start working him for long periods at a time right off

the bat. Or, if you’ve been riding only a day or two a week and want to start
doing more, don’t ask your horse to suddenly hit the trail every day.
Instead, condition your horse for whatever his ultimate exercise goal will be.
If you plan to ride on the trail for hours at a time, work up to it. If you plan to
ride him in jumping sessions for 45 minutes a day, this is his exercise goal.
Make sure that your horse is sound and healthy first by having your veteri-
narian examine him (if it’s been a while since he’s seen the doc), and then
start to add 15 minutes more to each of your ride times. If you currently ride
your horse for 30 minutes twice a week, increase your rides to 45 minutes
twice a week. After a couple of weeks, add another day of exercise so that
you’re riding him for 45 minutes three times a week. After two weeks, you can
add another day of riding.
The goal is to add exercise slowly so that you don’t make your horse sore or
lame. Increasing his exercise gradually rather than suddenly helps keep your
horse in a positive frame of mind for work. Nothing sours a horse more than
feeling sore and uncomfortable after being asked to do more than he’s physically
capable of doing.
Warming up
Whether you plan to ride your horse, longe him, or work him in the round
pen (we discuss these options later in this chapter), it’s vital that you warm
him up before you start his workout. A proper warm-up helps get his joints,
tendons, and ligaments ready for the job ahead. Horses who are properly
warmed up are less likely to injure themselves during exercise.
Start by asking your horse to stretch before you get on him. You can do this
by holding the reins and bending down, holding a carrot between his front
legs. This forces him to stretch his neck and back. Then, hold a carrot at the
left side of his abdomen and let him stretch his head around to reach it. Do
the same on the other side.
After you get on, you can begin the next phase of warm-up. Before you start
trotting your horse, have him walk for five to ten minutes to warm him up.
Ask him to do circles and figure-eights to get his mind warmed up too. Then
trot for a good five minutes or more before you ask for a canter or gallop.
Cooling down
Just as important as warming up is cooling down after a hard workout.
Among horse people, the expression “ridden hard and put away wet” is used
to describe someone who has received poor care. Giving a horse a hard
workout and then sticking him back in his stall dripping with sweat and
76
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

breathing hard is not a good thing. (Doing so can lead to muscle and respiratory
disorders; see Chapter 11 for more information.)
If you work your horse hard, take at least 10 minutes to cool him down before
putting him away. Remember these tips when cooling down your horse:
 Relax the girth. When you get off your horse after riding him hard,
loosen the girth a notch to give him some relief from the pressure of the
saddle as he tries to catch his breath.
 Walk him. Whether you’re still in the saddle or on the ground, walk your
horse for at least 10 minutes or until his breathing returns to normal.
 Avoid food and water. Don’t allow your horse to eat or drink until he
stops breathing hard. If you aren’t sure whether he’s cooled down
enough, check his respiration and compare it with his normal rate. (See
Chapter 2 for details on taking your horse’s respiration.)
 Let him dry. Your horse should stop sweating after he’s sufficiently
cooled down. If the weather is cold and his coat is soaked with sweat, it
may take quite a while for it to dry. Cover him with a cooler or sweat sheet
while you walk him to keep him from catching a chill until he dries off.
 Rub him down. Horses enjoy a good rubdown after a hard workout. Use
a rubber currycomb to give him a good grooming, followed by a brushing
and maybe a short massage. (See Chapter 4 for details on grooming.)
 Let him roll. If your horse wants to roll after you ride him, go ahead an
allow it. Rolling works as a self-administered chiropractic maneuver, and
is good for your horse’s back.
Cooling your horse down properly helps keep his attitude about exercise pos-
itive. He’ll feel good after his workout instead of feeling fatigue and discomfort.
Surveying Workout Options 
for Your Horse
As you probably know, you have a few options when you’re exercising your
horse. What’s important is that you get her feet moving and stimulate her
mind at the same time. In the following sections, we give you the lowdown on
a few activities, ranging from gentle to vigorous.
Mixing up your horse’s exercise routine is a good idea. Horses get bored with
the same activities every day, just like people do. Although they appreciate
having a regular routine, the actual activities can be varied from day to day to
keep them from becoming dull.
77
Chapter 5: Exercising for Health

Turning out
One way to get your stabled horse some exercise is to turn her out, which
means letting her run loose in a large paddock or pasture. If your horse lives
in a pasture, she already has all the free room she needs to run, roll, buck, and
just be a horse. But if she lives in a stall or small paddock, she’ll appreciate
some time in a larger enclosure where she can let loose.
Horses who receive regular turnout tend to have less pent-up energy. Even if
your horse just stands around in the turnout and stares at you, getting her
out of her stall and providing a change in scenery does her good.
Turnout is great in theory, but you must handle it with caution. Horses who
have been standing in a stall for hours on end can seriously hurt themselves
if they’re suddenly let loose to go crazy. Bowed tendons and even irreparable
fractures can occur during turnouts.
If you want to turn your horse out (as in Figure 5-1), follow these precautions:
 Work out first. Consider turning your horse out after you ride or work
her in a round pen or on the longe line. She’ll be less likely to go berserk
and hurt herself.
 Warm up. If you can’t turn her out after riding or exercising (some horses
feel so cooped up that they need a turnout before you can get on them),
loosen up her muscles, ligaments, and tendons with a 10-minute walk first.
 Cover the legs. If your horse wears shoes, put protective leg wear on
her. This protective wear helps to keep her from nicking herself with a
shoe when running around.
 Turn out alone. Don’t turn your horse out with another horse if the
horses don’t know each other, don’t get along, or are wearing shoes.
 Check for safety. Make sure that the turnout area has a fence at least 5
feet high so that your horse won’t jump it.
 Teach your horse. Don’t let your horse bolt away from you the minute
you take off her halter, because this is a dangerous habit. Instead, put
the lead rope around her neck before you undo the halter and make her
stand for 20 to 30 seconds before you release her.
 Reduce space. Try to use an arena that’s on the smaller side. This prevents
your horse from galloping wildly.
 Stay close. Keep a close watch on your horse while she’s in the turnout.
 Stay calm. Kissing to your horse to let her know that this is her time to
cavort if she wants to is okay, but don’t get carried away and start chasing
her with a whip or other object.
78
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Watch for riders. If you can only turn a horse out in a riding arena, make
sure that the arena is clear of riders before you let your horse go.
 Turn out often. Turn your horse out frequently to minimize her urge to
behave in a crazy manner that may get her hurt. Most horses need to be
turned out at least once a week.
Hand-walking
For days when you can’t ride — the weather is bad or your horse is recovering
from an injury or illness (we discuss recuperation from injury later in this
chapter) — hand-walking is a good alternative. You can hand-walk your horse
for 10 minutes or an hour, depending on how much time you have. The longer
you walk her the better, especially if your horse lives in a stall or small paddock.
Hand-walking your horse is easy if you have a well-behaved horse. Simply
dress her in her halter and lead rope, and go for a stroll. Hand-walking
loosens her joints, tendons, and ligaments; gets her circulation going; and
provides her with mental stimulation.
Figure 5-1:
To avoid
injury,
horses who
live in stalls
should be
warmed up
properly
before being
turned out.
79
Chapter 5: Exercising for Health

You can also use your hand-walking times as training sessions. If you want to
get your horse used to an unfamiliar trail before you climb on her back, hand-
walking is a good way to get started. Horses are braver when being led as
opposed to being ridden, and are more likely to get used to a strange place
without incident if you’re on the ground and in the lead.
Hand-walking also gives you a chance to bond with your horse and school
her on her ground manners. She should walk nicely alongside you, and stop
and turn when you ask her to. Ask her to back up on a loose lead rope, back
up in a circle, and do anything else that you can think of to challenge her mind.
You can work on all these things while you’re hand-walking your horse. You’ll
discover that she’s better behaved in the saddle after you spend time walking
her from the ground. (To brush up on the basics of leading your horse, see
Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition, co-written by your coauthor Audrey with
Janice Posnikoff, DVM, and published by Wiley.)
Longeing
Yet another way to exercise your horse is by longeing her. Longeing requires
that you stand in the center of an imaginary circle while your horse moves
around you at the various gaits. You can do this at the end of a longe line (a
rope that attaches to the horse’s halter or bridle), or in a round pen.
Longeing is a good way to exercise your horse for several reasons, including
the following:
 You can provide controlled exercise on days you can’t ride.
 You can use longeing to help your horse get rid of excess energy before you
get on her.
 Longeing helps teach your horse to respect you and to respond to voice
commands.
If you’ve never longed a horse, you should get an experienced person to help
you. (You can also read about longeing in Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition.)
Horses have to be trained to longe, so if your horse has never done it, she
needs to be taught. You’ll have to get help for that too.
Follow these guidelines for longeing (and check out Figure 5-2 to see what it
looks like):
 Longe smart. Be sure to warm up and cool down your horse before and
after longeing (we discuss warming up and cooling down earlier in this
chapter).
 Work both sides. Longe your horse in both directions so that you don’t
build up muscles more on one side of the body than the other.
80
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Build up. Slowly work your horse up to longeing with a 15-minute session,
gradually getting to your ultimate goal. A half an hour to 45 minutes is the
maximum time that you should spend longeing your horse at a time.
 Don’t overdo it. Avoid longeing more than a couple of times a week
because traveling in tight circles can cause stress on your horse’s legs.
 Protect the legs. If your horse wears shoes, put protective leg wear and
bell boots on her to avoid possible injury.
 Cover your hands. Wear gloves when you longe to protect your hands.
Riding
Of course the most fun you’ll have exercising your horse is by riding her.
Whether you work hard in the arena or simply stroll down the trail, riding
provides great exercise for your horse while also stimulating her mind. Plus,
the more you ride your horse, the better she’ll become under saddle.
In order for your horse to enjoy being ridden by you — and for riding to be
good, healthy exercise for her — pay attention to these guidelines:
 Fit tack. Make certain the saddle, bridle, and other tack you use on your
horse is in good working order and fits properly. Poorly fitting tack can
make your horse sore and uncomfortable. It can also make your horse
appear lame when she’s really just trying to compensate for the pain of
poorly fitting tack.
Figure 5-2:
When you
longe your
horse, warm
her up and
cool her
down just as
you would
when riding.
81
Chapter 5: Exercising for Health

 Groom well. Be sure to groom your horse thoroughly before riding her.
Dirt and debris can get caught between your horse’s coat and her tack,
causing irritation and soreness.
 Warm up. Don’t jump on your horse and just take off. Always warm your
horse up first for about 10 minutes with mostly walking and some trotting
to get her muscles, ligaments, and tendons warmed up.
 Cool down. Don’t stick your horse back in her stall or pasture sweating
and breathing hard. Cool her down with a 10- (or more-) minute walk so
that her respiration goes back to normal before you put her away. (We
discuss both warming up and cooling down earlier in this chapter.)
 Take lessons. Even the best rider still has more to learn. Continue your
education as a rider by taking lessons now and then. The better you
ride, the easier it is on your horse.
 Vary your riding. Don’t do the same activities over and over again with
your horse because it’ll make her bored. Mix up your riding with arena
work, trail rides, and group activities.
 Be considerate. Work your horse only at the level she’s comfortable with.
If you ride only once a week, don’t expect her to go on a four-hour ride in
one day. Be considerate of your horse and condition her for long rides, as
we explain in the earlier section “Easing into a routine.”
For more details on how to ride, see coauthor Audrey’s book Horseback
Riding For Dummies, co-written with Shannon Sand and published by Wiley.
Helping Your Horse Recover 
from Injuries or Illness
Horses are athletes and, like all athletes, run the risk of injury. When a human
athlete gets hurt, he or she has to go on the disabled list. Same goes for horses.
When a horse has to be “laid up” because of an injury or an illness, he has to
stop his normal exercise routine and go into recuperation mode. In the following
sections, we explain the importance of full recuperation and show you how
to ease your horse back into exercise.
Knowing the importance of rest
Horses have amazing recuperative powers. Their bodies can do self-repair on
some of the scariest of injuries, especially injuries to muscles and tendons.
But in order for a horse’s body to work on repairing itself, the injured area
needs to rest. Putting further strain on damaged muscles, ligaments, or bones
82
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

only worsens the problem, possibly to the point of no return. For this reason,
it’s vital that injured horses receive proper lay-up so that they can heal.
Lay-up can be extremely frustrating for horse owners. You spend a lot of money
and time on your horse every month, and you want to enjoy him. If he’s laid
up, you can’t do much of anything with him except pay the feed and vet bills.
So, the tendency of many owners is to rush horses through lay-up. As soon as
they see that the horse is feeling better, they want to get the horse back into
work. The truth of the matter is that getting a horse back into work too soon
can cause the injury to reoccur, and the lay-up to start all over again.
The amount of time and the type of recuperation depend on the injury; your
veterinarian will tell you how long your horse needs to be laid up. In some
cases, laid-up horses can be hand-walked or even ridden at a walk, depending
on the injury. Other horses are given “stall rest,” which means that they aren’t
even supposed to leave their enclosures. Whatever type of lay-up is required,
it’s vital that you follow your vet’s instructions in order to give your horse the
best chance at recovery. Your horse will thank you for it, and you’ll reap 
the rewards after your equine companion is back in fighting shape.
Keeping your horse sane during lay-up
Humans aren’t the only ones who get frustrated during lay-up. Horses —
especially active, high-strung horses — can literally go crazy during a long
lay-up. A horse who’s been working hard, particularly at a competitive activ-
ity, and has to suddenly stop all activity and become sedentary often has a
difficult time adjusting. This is especially true of horses put on stall rest.
These poor creatures aren’t even allowed to leave their immediate confines.
As a compassionate horse owner, you can do a few things to help your horse
keep his sanity while being cooped up during lay-up. Here are some suggestions:
 Walk him. If your horse is allowed hand-walking but nothing else, take
advantage of it and get him out every day. A 20-minute walk for a normally
active horse isn’t much, but it’s better than nothing and can do wonders
to keep a horse from feeling like he’s gone into no man’s land.
 Find companionship. If your horse is stuck in lay-up, get him a buddy.
This can mean moving him to a stall or paddock with a horse next door
to interact with. You may not want to put another horse in the same
pasture with your horse because the two of them may decide to play
and run around. But a next-door neighbor can relieve the boredom and
loneliness of lay-up.
 Add stall toys. Some horses like to play with toys in their stall or pad-
dock. You can find balls, hanging treats, and all kinds of other goodies
designed for horseplay at a tack store or online. Having something like
this in your horse’s stall can help him keep from going stir crazy.
83
Chapter 5: Exercising for Health

 Groom him. Even if your horse is on stall rest, you can still shower him
with attention by grooming him every day. Clean his feet to keep them
healthy, and brush and massage him to keep him from feeling neglected.
(See Chapter 4 for grooming information.)
 Cut his feed. If your horse has been on grain, alfalfa, or any kind of high-
performance diet or supplement, you need to change his diet during lay-
up. Giving him high-energy feed during his recuperation will make him
put on weight and leave him feeling even more pent up. Your vet can
recommend a feeding program for lay-up. (Part II has the full scoop on
nutrition and feeding for your horse.)
 Alter his feed. Give your horse grass hay to munch on during the day and
at night to give him something to do. If your horse puts on weight easily,
give him smaller portions more frequently instead. Giving him something
to chew on will help keep him mentally and physically stimulated.
Be patient with your laid-up horse. He may start to get cranky, mouthy, or
spooky as time goes on — all signs of a bored horse with pent-up energy.
Reassure him — and yourself — that the lay-up is just temporary and life will
eventually get back to normal.
Returning your horse to his exercise routine
When it’s time to get your laid-up horse back into an exercise routine, things
can get tricky. Your horse doesn’t know that he needs to take it easy so that
he doesn’t reinjure himself. Instead, he’s going to be anxious to run, buck,
and get out all that energy that’s he’s had pent up for so long.
Your veterinarian can be a huge help during this part of the process. He or
she can give you instructions on exactly how to start your horse back on his
journey to normal exercise. These instructions depend on your horse’s injury
as well as his age and personality.
Keep these pointers in mind when getting your horse back into the swing of
things:
 Go slowly. Whatever you do, make his reintroduction to exercise slow
and methodical.
 Short but frequent. Making a slow reintroduction to exercise is a challenge
because your horse wants to go hog wild at first. You can help combat this
tendency by making his exercise sessions short but regular. After getting a
10- or 20-minute workout daily for a few days, your horse should start to
calm down and allow you to slowly get him back into shape.
84
Part I: Honing Basic Horse Care Skills 

 Keep control. Avoid any kind of exercise in the beginning that limits
your control of your horse’s behavior. If he’s been living in a stall or small
paddock, don’t turn him out for at least a couple of weeks after regular
exercise. Otherwise, he’ll run, buck, and go crazy — and possibly reinjure
himself. Instead, longe him (if your vet says it’s okay), or make him canter
around loose inside a small round pen (50 feet in diameter or less).
 Stay safe. Remember that your horse has been cooped up for a long time
and may not have the same attitude he does when he’s being exercised
on a regular basis. Don’t get on your horse until you know that he’s over
his initial burst of energy at being “free” again. This means that you may
need to exercise him from the ground by longeing him or working him in
a round pen for a couple of weeks before you get on.
After your horse is back to his normal routine, and is sound and healthy
again, you’ll discover that the long lay-up was well worth the effort.

 Discovering the importance of water and fiber

M
ost people don’t think much about their own nutrition. They eat what
they want while trying to watch their weight. Fortunately, they’re able
to get most of the nutrition that they need from everyday foods.
Domestic horses, on the other hand, can’t eat whatever they want. They’re
dependent on their owners and caretakers to provide them with foods that
will get them the nutrition they need to stay healthy. The consequences of
not doing so can be dire, which is why understanding equine nutrition is so
important for horse owners.
In this chapter, we explain what horses need to eat and why. You discover the
importance of water, protein, fats, carbohydrates, and roughage to the equine
body, and you find out about essential equine vitamins and minerals. We also
describe in detail why all these elements are vital if your horse is to stay
healthy. Flip to Chapter 7 for specific information on different types of feed
for your horse.
Drink Up! The Importance 
of Water in a Horse’s Diet
Every living creature, without exception, needs water to survive. This is cer-
tainly true of horses, who need to drink anywhere from 10 to 20 gallons or
more of water a day to keep their bodies working in good order. As much as
60 to 70 percent of a horse’s body weight is made up of water.

Horses lose much of the water that they drink through the process of diges-
tion and through urination, respiration, and sweating. This water needs to 
be replenished throughout the day, which is why providing your horse with
fresh water at all times is vital.
Horses get their water in three different ways: they drink it, obtain it from
moist food, and produce it internally as they break down fats, protein, and
carbs during digestion.
Here are just some of the reasons why water is vital to your horse’s body:
 Water is necessary for gastrointestinal health and function.
 The function of muscles and nerves is dependent on water.
 Horses who eat high-protein diets (such as alfalfa hay) require increased
water to metabolize their feed. This is also true of horses who have a
large amount of protein, salt, and potassium in their diet.
 Normal breathing expels water from the body, and that water has to be
replaced.
 Nursing mares need water to produce milk for their foals.
Horses who don’t get enough water are at risk of becoming seriously ill and
even dying. If your horse loses about 100 pounds of her body weight in water,
she’s at risk for fatal dehydration. This is why it’s vital that horses have
round-the-clock access to clean, fresh water, and that they’re encouraged to
drink it.
Remember these points when providing water for your horse:
 Always have water available; you can provide automatic waterers, buckets,
or troughs in your horse’s enclosure. Make sure to check your buckets or
troughs a couple of times a day to be certain that your horse has water.
 If you use automatic waterers, use a bucket style (as opposed to the
bowl and paddle type) because most horses like this style better, and
will drink more often.
 Check automatic waterers daily to make sure that they’re working.
Consider keeping a backup water source in your horse’s stall if you can’t
check the system daily.
 Keep buckets, troughs, and automatic waterers clean and free of algae
and debris. A good rule of thumb is to clean these devices at least once
a week or more if they need it. (Consider locating them in the shade to
cut down on the amount of algae.)

 If you’re traveling with your horse and feeding her dry feeds like hay (as
opposed to pasture grass), be sure that she has access to water for at
least an hour afterward. You can offer water in a bucket during rest
stops along your trip.
 When traveling with your horse, make sure that she gets enough water
by soaking hay in a hay net before offering it to her. (This trick will help
keep her hydrated, but it’s not a substitute for offering water in a
bucket.)
 Warm up your horse’s water if the weather is cold; you can use a bucket
warmer or a waterer equipped with a heater. Colic is more common in
winter months because horses don’t like to drink cold water.
 In the wintertime, ice can form in water buckets. If you live in a cold cli-
mate, use a waterer equipped with a heater, or break the ice throughout
the day to ensure that your horse can get to her water.
You may notice your horse dunking her hay in her water. Although it makes a
mess of the water, it’s actually good for the horse’s body because it provides
her with moist feed. Coauthor Dr. Kate has even seen foals learn this behav-
ior by watching their mothers do it.
If you have a horse who seems to drink too much, she may be sick, or she
may be bored. Some confined horses consume lots of extra water to give
themselves something to do. If your horse is drinking an excessive amount of
water and urinating a lot, call your vet immediately. Her behavior may well be
boredom but could also signal a metabolic problem, too.
Keeping Your Horse’s System Working
Right with Roughage
Without roughage, your horse wouldn’t live too long. In the wild, horses
graze for around 18 hours a day, eating various tough, fibrous plants that
they find in their environment.
The equine digestive system was designed to process this type of material.
Although human bodies would be hard pressed to digest this tough cellulose,
horses are built to do just that. Without roughage and the fiber it provides,
their bodies can’t function.
91
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

What does fiber do?
Most people know what happens to their bodies if they don’t get enough
fiber. No doubt that’s why bran muffins and high-fiber cereals have become
so popular.
If people need fiber, horses need it a lot more. Fiber helps keep the intestines
working properly, prompting normal motility that pushes particles of
digested food through the system in an efficient manner. In other words, fiber
helps your horse’s intestines move food wastes through and out of his body.
Which foods are rich in fiber?
Horses who roam free have no trouble finding fiber-rich foods for their diets.
The grasses, brush, and even tree bark that they encounter in their environ-
ment does the trick. Domestic horses, however, rely on their owners to 
provide them with the fiber they need.
The most important source of fiber for stabled horses is hay, whereas pasture-
kept horses get their fiber from pasture grass. Each of these two sources 
provides significant fiber (in addition to providing necessary carbohydrates
for energy, as we explain later in this chapter). They also satisfy the horses’
innate and powerful urge to chew. Fulfilling that urge by feeding hay or allow-
ing a horse to graze on good pasture makes for a happier, healthier horse.
Another feed with a lot of fiber is beet pulp. When soaked in water, beet pulp
is a good choice as a source of fiber for senior horses who have trouble
chewing hay. It’s also great for horses suffering from COPD, because when
soaked, it’s free of dust. (See Chapter 11 for more details on COPD.) Horses
seem to love beet pulp, and it provides almost as much fiber as hay does.
How much roughage should 
your horse have?
Your horse can’t have too much roughage. The more roughage he eats the
better. The only caveat is not to feed him so much that he becomes fat. Give
your horse as much hay or pasture access as you can while still keeping his
body at a healthy weight by providing the right balance of carbs, protein, and
fat and by giving him plenty of exercise (see Chapter 5).
92
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

A good way to provide roughage without adding too many calories is to 
feed your horse grass hay. Grass hays in form of orchardgrass, Bermuda, 
or timothy can provide roughage and may not encourage your horse to put
on weight.
Energizing Your Horse with
Carbohydrates, Protein, and Fat
Your horse can’t live by carbs, protein, or fat alone. All three of these vital
nutritional components must be present for a horse’s diet to be complete.
Carbs, protein, and fat are found in different sources of food in varying
amounts. In the following sections, we look at these components, why 
they’re important, and how your horse gets them.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are the primary source for usable and readily available
energy, and all horses need carbs to function. Carbs, in other words, are the
primary fuel source necessary to keep the machine running! On the other
hand, too many carbs can cause a lot of problems for horses, which is why
it’s important to know the best types of carbs around and the right amount to
feed to your horse.
Discovering what carbs do
The building block of carbohydrates is glucose. In addition to providing the
basis for carbohydrates, glucose components are also important for other
roles, such as the manufacturing of glucosamine, which is so important for
healthy joints. Brain function and hoof growth are also fueled by glucose.
The two basic types of carbohydrates are simple sugars, like glucose, and
complex carbohydrates, like starches, which are found in pasture grass and
grains. The latter must be broken down into simple sugars before their
energy is released in a more easily usable form.
93
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

Horses who are exercising or growing, or who are in the last trimester of
pregnancy or early in lactation, require more energy in their diet, which can
be obtained through carbohydrates. An excess of carbohydrates can leave a
horse with too much energy (often making her spooky and unmanageable),
and in high doses, it can cause laminitis and other metabolic problems. (See
Chapter 11 for more information on these conditions.) Horses who get more
energy than they need through carbohydrates store the excess as fat.
Horses with a carbohydrate-deficient diet have to break down fats and pro-
teins to use as energy — even for the most basic of metabolic functions. They
become lethargic and can’t perform well. They lose their body condition, and
pregnant mares can abort. Stallions lose their sex drive, and youngsters show
poor growth.
Choosing from the abundance of carbohydrate-rich foods
Foods high in carbohydrates are easy to find in the horse world. Because
carbs are an easy source of energy, they’re popular among horse people who
want their horses to have some “oomph.” Sources of carbohydrates include
the following:
 Grains: Oats, corn, and barley are three grains that are high in 
carbohydrates.
 Hay: Alfalfa and orchardgrass can be particularly high in carbs, depend-
ing on when the hay was harvested. Hay cut at a later stage of maturity
is lower in carbs than hay that’s cut early.
 Pasture grass: Pasture grasses can be high in carbohydrates, depending
on the species of plant, stage of growth, and environment. Cool-season
grasses, such as bluegrass and tall fescue, produce sugars during photo-
synthesis, sometimes to excess.
 Commercial feeds: Certain commercial products known as “sweet
feeds” and pelleted feeds can be high in carbohydrates. The molasses
added to sweet feeds is a significant source of carbs in these products,
as is corn.
 Beet pulp: A byproduct in the manufacture of table sugar, beet pulp is
dried for storage. It’s available as feed for horses in shredded or pelleted
form, and is a good source of carbohydrates, although it can be deficient
in vitamin A and selenium. (It should always be soaked in water before
being fed.)
Your vet can help you determine the best carbohydrate to feed your horse
based on her individual nutritional needs.
94
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Figuring out how much to give your horse
Trying to figure out the right amount of carbohydrates to feed your horse 
can be complicated. The finer details of nutritional issues and corresponding
energy production can make your head spin. To top it off, various sources of
carbohydrates are available to your horse, and you want to make sure that
you don’t overdose her on carbs.
The good news is that you don’t need to worry too much about deliberately
adding carbs to your horse’s diet. As long as you’re feeding your adult 
horse a basic diet of good-quality hay or pasture grass, her carbohydrate
needs usually will be met. (We discuss feeding hay and pasture grass in 
detail in Chapter 7.) Exceptions may be if your horse has an extremely fast
metabolism, has a slow metabolism, or is undergoing very intense training
and exercise. In these cases, your veterinarian can give you specific advice
about what to feed your horse to more finely control her carbohydrate
intake.
Proteins
Although horses aren’t meat-eaters (those weird show horses who share 
hot dogs with their owners notwithstanding), they still need protein. An
essential ingredient to proper equine nutrition, protein is necessary for a
horse’s survival. On the other hand, too much protein can cause problems.
Understanding what protein does for the body and how much to feed is
essential if you want your horse to be healthy.
Discovering what these building blocks do
Proteins are building blocks, and horses must have protein in order to 
construct new tissue. Muscle, hair, skin, hormones, and hooves — to name
just a few parts of the horse — can be healthy only if a horse is getting
enough protein.
Horses who don’t get enough protein in their diet develop a rough haircoat
and endure weight loss, decreased milk production (for lactating mares), 
and decreased energy. On the other hand, horses with an excess of protein 
in their diets drink too much water and urinate a lot. They sweat too much
when exercising, which leads to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. For
this reason, too much protein can really be detrimental to a hard-working
horse.
95
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

Getting protein from plants and grains
Fortunately, you don’t need a degree in nutrition to figure out how to give
your horse the proper amount of protein. All you need is to do a quick study
of the protein level of available feeds.
Horses glean proteins from plants and grains. Different plants and grains
have different protein contents. Proteins are made up of amino acids in vari-
ous combinations, so all proteins are not created equal. That’s why getting
your feed from very reputable sources is crucial.
Here are the protein levels of common types of high-quality feed:
 Alfalfa hay: Quality alfalfa for horses has about 18 percent protein.
Poor-quality alfalfa hay may have 14 to 15 percent protein.
 Grass hay: High-quality grass hay contains 7 to 12 percent of crude 
protein.
 Soybean meal: With a 44-percent protein content, soybean meal is a
good source of supplemental protein when added to feed. This feed is
usually most suitable for young horses and lactating mares.
 Linseed meal: This meal may be a good source of protein for horses
who suffer from rhabdomyolisis (also known as tying up syndrome, azo-
turia, or myoglobinuria) because it contains selenium, which may be
helpful in managing this condition in some parts of the country. (For
details on azoturia, see Chapter 11.) Linseed meal may contain as much
as 35 percent protein. However, it’s low in lysine, so it shouldn’t be a
horse’s only source of protein (this is especially true for young horses).
With all these choices, how do you know which type of protein-rich food to
give to your horse? The best rule of thumb when deciding what protein-rich
foods to feed your horse is to talk to your veterinarian, county extension
agent, or local university nutritionist, if you have one.
Consuming the right amount of protein
A good rule to remember when dealing with protein and horses is that your
horse should consume between 8 and 10 percent of her rations in protein.
That rule is for adult horses. Young, growing horses — that is, horses who
are younger than 2 years old — need more protein than mature horses.
Lactating mares also need extra protein to help them produce milk for their
foals. Young horses and nursing mares should have 12 to 14 percent of their
rations in protein.
96
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Your veterinarian can help you determine which feeds to use and how much
you should give your horse to meet her protein requirements.
Old wives’ tales abound in the horse world, and one is that mature horses in
training or those getting a lot of exercise need more protein than idle horses.
This isn’t true! Although very active horses may lose a small amount of nitro-
gen in their sweat, they get all the nitrogen they need from grain energy
sources needed to fulfill their requirements. To support this, many astute
owners will tell you that grumpy, irritable horses calm down and feel better
when their protein levels are at the correct level.
Fats
Fat is a dirty word in the rider’s vocabulary. Too much of it makes a human
portly, and that’s not good for a horse’s back. But when you’re dealing 
with horse nutrition, fat is vitally important, as you find out in the following
sections.
Letting fat do its job
The body uses fat to create energy. Fat also fosters good nerve and hormone
production. Fat is also important for the functioning of all organs, and it helps
keep the body from breaking down muscle tissue to use as energy.
Horses who eat fats are less likely to have digestive and metabolic problems,
such as colic, laminitis, tying up, and stomach ulcers. This is especially true
when compared to horses who are fed large amounts of grain.
Fats are the most calorie-dense form of energy, providing three times the
number of kilocalories of energy than carbohydrates and proteins. That’s
why keeping a close eye on your horse’s fat intake is important; you don’t
want her to become overweight!
Finding the best fatty foods for your horse
When you’re feeding fat to horses, corn oil is the most economical way to
add it. Although corn oil is somewhat messy, many horses love it. Some
people prefer to give their horses rice bran oil, but we like corn oil because it
has twice the calories per pound than rice bran products. That means that
you can feed less of it and spend less money.
If you’re looking to save money, you may be tempted to give your horse a
combination vegetable oil containing soybean oil, sunflower oil, and canola
oil. These lack the palatability of corn oil and aren’t as good for your horse.
97
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

If you shop at a big box store that sells food items in large quantities, you can
buy corn oil in big jugs for considerably less than you would pay at your local
supermarket.
If you don’t like the idea of handling oil every day, consider using food-grade
stabilized rice bran. It’s about 20 percent fat, and easily digested by horses. It
provides an excellent source of energy. Rice bran products can be mixed into
food or added on top of feed.
If you plan to feed commercial bran, you should know that at high levels, this
feed can cause a mineral imbalance in your horse. The body has to compen-
sate for this imbalance by taking calcium from its primary storage source:
bones. This can result in a decrease in bone density that will in turn lead to
an increase in fractures and injuries. It can also contribute to developmental
orthopedic problems in young horses. To avoid causing a mineral imbalance
in your horse, don’t feed more bran than what’s recommended on the label.
Another way to provide fat to your horse is through high-fat commercial
feeds. These are often excellent in content (percentages vary among feeds)
and palatability. However, after a certain percentage, fats require a process
called “extrusion” to keep them from spoiling quickly and to remain palat-
able. You’ll recognize these feeds because they’ll remind you of dry dog food.
Good extruded feeds can be more expensive but are worthwhile if your horse
won’t eat her fat any other way.
When storing fat-rich foods, be sure to keep them in a cool environment —
they can easily become rancid in the heat. You’ll be able to smell an “off”
odor when fats get rancid, and most horses won’t eat it.
Feeding your horse enough fat
Up until about 12 years ago, experts didn’t think that horses needed much fat
in their diets, and that too much fat was detrimental. Now experts say that
horses can tolerate up to 20 percent of their total diet in fat.
Figuring out how much fat to feed your horse is easy. If you use oil, start with
a 1⁄4 cup per day mixed in a small portion of commercial feed or grain (see
Figure 6-1), and work your way up to 1 cup over a period of one week,
increasing in 1⁄4-cup intervals.
Your horse doesn’t need or want more oil than one cup per day, so adding
more doesn’t help her, and it won’t hurt her. However, more oil per day may
decrease the palatability of the feed (she probably won’t eat it), and it may
damage your wallet.
98
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

If you prefer to use a commercial rice bran product or a high-fat commercial
feed, follow the directions on the bag for how much to feed. Don’t overfeed
because your horse may start to get fat!
Understanding the Value of Vitamins
You probably already know that vitamins are important for people, and
they’re just as important for horses. The body needs these very small organic
compounds for metabolic function, for the clotting of blood, to aid muscle
contractions, for heart function, for body tissue growth, and for much, much
more.
Too many vitamins can be toxic, however, so make sure that you have a thor-
ough understanding of these nutrients and how they work before you start
adding them to your horse’s diet.
Telling the difference between 
different types of vitamins
Vitamins come in two types: water-soluble and fat-soluble. These two 
classes of vitamins are very different, and are processed differently in your
horse’s body.
Figure 6-1:
Adding oil to
a horse’s
feed.
99
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

Water-soluble vitamins
Water-soluble vitamins are required primarily as enzyme cofactors in metabo-
lism. In other words, enzymes need water-soluble vitamins to perform their
functions in the body. Horses easily excrete water-soluble vitamins from the
body through the urine; these vitamins aren’t stored for future use.
Here are the most important water-soluble vitamins for horses (all are 
present in good-quality hay and pasture):
 Vitamin C: Horses make their own vitamin C. Vitamin C is produced by
the liver, and is also found in green, leafy foliages; fruits; and vegetables.
 Vitamin B (complex): The B complex vitamins include vitamins B1, B2,
B5, B6, B9, and B12, and the horse’s body produces them. They’re
byproducts of the gut’s microbial fermentation.
Some people give nervous horses B vitamins to calm them. These vita-
mins help only if the horse is so stressed that his body isn’t producing
enough on his own. Coauthor Dr. Kate has never seen vitamin B change
behavior in a normal, healthy horse.
 Choline: This B vitamin helps metabolize fat, maintain good cell 
structure, and preserve normal nerve function.
Fat-soluble vitamins
Fat-soluble vitamins are difficult for the body to excrete and can be easily
stored. This is a good thing in most cases, although if too much of a fat-
soluble vitamin is found in a horse’s diet, it can cause toxicity because the
horse isn’t able to eliminate the excess amount.
These fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for a horse’s good health:
 Vitamin A: This vitamin is used for vision and the creation of epithelial
cells (important cells that can be found in many different parts of the
body). It’s also necessary for normal bone metabolism. Vitamin A also
plays an important role in reproduction.
Signs of vitamin A deficiency are night blindness, brittle bones, poor
haircoat, excessive tearing, and increased respiratory infections.
Horses obtain vitamin A from their diet by ingesting its precursor, beta
carotene. Carotene is found in high amounts in fresh green pasture, but
it oxidizes very quickly, so the content decreases when hay is cured and
stored for more than six months. The only hay that retains a fair amount
of vitamin A after storage is alfalfa, and even then, it diminishes over
time. Horses aren’t very efficient in converting beta carotene to active
vitamin A, so depending on your hay source, you may need to supple-
ment (see the next section for more information).
100
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Vitamin D: This vitamin is obtained by exposure to sunlight, so horses
who are stalled most of the time are at risk for vitamin D deficiency
unless they receive supplementation. If a horse spends at least four to
six hours a day in a paddock or pasture, he’ll receive plenty of vitamin D.
Vitamin D is important in the normal absorption and utilization of cal-
cium and phosphorus. Deficiency in this vitamin can result in rickets
(distortion of the bones) in young animals, and osteomalacia (softening
of the bones) in mature horses. On the other hand, large doses or over-
supplementation of vitamin D can lead to calcification of soft tissues.
 Vitamin E: A potent antioxidant (a compound that protects body tissue
from damage during the conversion of food to energy), vitamin E is
important in nerve function, as well as in other physiological functions
in the horse’s body. It’s necessary for membrane stability and red blood
cell integrity, and may be important in reproduction. A horse deficient in
vitamin E can develop equine motor neuron disease, which is a rare con-
dition of the nerve cells, and equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy,
which is a degenerative nerve disease of the spinal cord and brain stem.
Horses kept on pasture most of the year seldom develop deficient vita-
min E levels.
Vitamin E is usually present in ample quantity in natural feeds, particu-
larly roughages, cereal grains, and especially in cereal grain oils like
wheat germ oil. Vitamin E has a special relationship with the mineral
selenium. The interaction between these two nutrients may be impor-
tant in the management, treatment, and prevention of rhabdomyolisis
(also known as azoturia or tying up). See Chapter 11 for more on this
condition.
Horses under stress and with heavy workloads may benefit from vitamin
E supplementation, and horses with nerve problems or certain muscle
function problems — like those that can result from West Nile virus and
EPM — may also benefit from vitamin E supplementation. (For more
details on West Nile virus and EPM, see Chapter 12.)
 Vitamin K: This vitamin is important for blood clotting. A product of gut
microbial fermentation like vitamin E, vitamin K can also be found in
some green, leafy plants.
Horses suffering from a vitamin K deficiency develop bleeding disorders.
Too much vitamin K may cause toxicity and can result in liver failure.
If you’re feeding your horse a very high-fat diet for some reason, be aware
that it may increase his need for higher levels of fat-soluble vitamins. Ask
your vet whether this should be a concern with your horse.
101
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

Adding vitamins to your horse’s diet
Go to any tack and feed store and you’ll see plenty of vitamin supplements
for the “performance” horse. In fact, a large segment of the equine products
industry is devoted to various vitamin and mineral supplements.
Before you succumb to the marketing on the label, talk to your vet about how
to provide the best diet for your horse given his individual circumstances.
Your horse is best served if he gets all his vitamins from his diet.
A healthy horse on a good diet doesn’t need extra vitamins. When water-
soluble vitamins are provided in excess, horses just urinate them out. These
vitamins aren’t stored in the body, so feeding them to your horse may make
you feel better, but unless your horse is extremely stressed (which may upset
the happy GI tract leading to decreased microbial action), supplementation
isn’t necessary. Adding fat-soluble vitamins, which are stored in the body, can
cause a problem, especially with vitamin A, when oversupplementation could
affect the liver.
That said, added vitamins may be necessary in certain situations, like when 
a horse is growing, lactating, in heavy race training, or recuperating from a
prolonged illness. In these situations, higher amounts of some vitamins can
be useful. Still, meeting those vitamin requirements via the diet, if possible, 
is best.
If you’re at all confused about whether to provide your horse with a vitamin
supplement, talk to your vet. If he or she recommends adding vitamins to
your horse’s ration, you can mix them with a small amount of commercial
pellet feed (see Figure 6-2).

Staying Strong with Minerals
Horses (and humans) need minerals to metabolize fats, proteins, and carbo-
hydrates. They also need minerals for their muscles and nerves to function
properly and for their bones to be strong.
Minerals come in two different forms: major minerals and trace minerals.
Each serves a unique purpose in the equine body.
Major minerals
Major minerals, or macrominerals as they’re also called, are found in larger
quantities in the horse’s body than trace minerals. These major minerals
include the following elements:
 Calcium: Necessary for bone strength and repair, calcium is also needed
in the horse’s body for the function of cardiac muscles, cell membrane
strength, glandular function, body temperature regulation, and blood
clotting. Adult horses deficient in calcium can develop lameness or a
softening of the bones; young horses can develop brittle bones that
easily fracture. Older horses absorb calcium less efficiently than
younger horses, so they sometimes need calcium supplementation pos-
sibly in equal proportion to phosphorus.
 Magnesium: This mineral is important to bone strength and enzyme per-
formance. Horses deficient in magnesium can experience nervousness
and muscle tremors.
 Phosphorus: A close partner to calcium, phosphorus is required for
healthy bones and teeth. It also aids in the function of cells and is vital
for mares producing milk for their foals. Horses lacking phosphorus can
develop lameness that shifts from leg to leg.
 Potassium: Horses need potassium, an electrolyte, to maintain the bal-
ance of body fluid. Horses who don’t get enough potassium can become
fatigued, have weak muscles, and eat and drink less. Some potassium-
deficient horses even show behavior changes and become spooky and
restless.
 Sodium and chloride: These two elements together make salt, a vital
mineral necessary to the horse’s body function. Considered electrolytes,
sodium and chloride are necessary for correct chemistry of the horse’s
body fluids. Horses who don’t get enough sodium chloride tire easily,
stop sweating, and experience muscle spasms.
103
Chapter 6: The Building Blocks of Good Nutrition

Both of these minerals are easily lost through sweating and urination, so
they must be supplemented in the form of a salt block (see Figure 6-3) or
free-choice loose salt.
 Sulfur: Necessary to healthy hooves and coat, sulfur also helps in the
metabolism of the B vitamins and other important elements in the
horse’s body.
Bob Langrish
With the exception of sodium and chloride, major minerals may not need to
be supplemented to horses who are eating a good diet of water and quality
hay, pasture, or commercial feed. If supplementation of minerals is necessary,
your vet will let you know.
Trace minerals
Trace minerals, or microminerals, are so called because they’re needed only
in very small amounts in the horse’s body. Although horses need only tiny
measurements of these elements, they’re still vital for the horse’s health and
well-being.
Trace minerals important to horses include:
 Cobalt: Closely tied to the function of vitamin B12 (which we discuss
earlier in this chapter), cobalt enables the body to produce this impor-
tant vitamin. Researchers haven’t seen any problems in horses from too
much or not enough cobalt, so horse owners have no need to supple-
ment this mineral in healthy horses; your horse will receive enough
cobalt from her feed.
Figure 6-3:

chloride.
104
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Copper: Creation and maintenance of the horse’s connective tissue is
dependent upon copper in the body. Copper also enables the horse’s
body to utilize iron and synthesize melanin, which is pigment in the
body. Insufficient levels of copper can cause hind limb weakness and
infertility. Horses usually get enough copper in their diets, although
copper can usually be added in supplementation without risk of toxicity.
Discuss this option with your veterinarian.
 Iodine: This trace mineral aids in the absorption of thyroid hormones,
and is necessary for overall good health. Horses deficient in iodine can
develop swollen thyroid glands; too much iodine can cause the same
problem. Most horse feed contains adequate amounts of iodine, so sup-
plementation isn’t necessary. However, talk to your vet about a possible
need to add this mineral to your horse’s diet (particularly if you have a
pregnant mare or foal) if feed grown in your area is lacking in iodine.
 Iron: Just as in the human body, iron is used to produce hemoglobin, a
vital part of red blood cells. Fortunately, iron is plentiful in most hays
and pasture grasses, and rarely needs to be supplemented. In fact, too
much iron prevents the absorption of other minerals, such as zinc and
copper, and creates a deficiency in these elements. Excess iron is espe-
cially dangerous to newborn foals.
That said, horses who have lost a considerable amount of blood can
often benefit from iron supplementation. Supplement iron only if your
vet has taken a blood test, and the results indicate that your horse has 
a need for this mineral.
 Manganese: A mineral used for the metabolism of lipids (a type of fat)
and carbohydrates, manganese also helps the horse’s body metabolize
chondroitant sulfate, which helps joints stay healthy. This mineral is
most important to growing foals, who can develop cartilage and bone
deformities without it. Your vet will let you know whether your horse
needs a manganese supplement.
 Selenium: Working in partnership with vitamin E, selenium is a powerful
antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from free-radical damage.
Normal, healthy horses need only a very small amount of selenium in
their diet, and shouldn’t be supplemented with this mineral unless your
vet indicates otherwise. Selenium is present in most hay and pasture
grass, although soil in some areas of the U.S. is deficient in it. In these
situations, you may need to supplement this mineral.
Because horses’ bodies easily become toxic if oversupplemented with
selenium, make certain that your horse needs selenium before adding it
to her feed or providing her with a mineral salt block that contains it.
Your veterinarian can advise you on this.
 Zinc: Enzymes containing zinc help the horse’s body metabolize the
important dietary elements of carbohydrates and proteins. A lack of zinc
in the diet may cause brittle hooves and a dull haircoat. Hay and pasture
grasses contain adequate levels of zinc, so supplementing this mineral
isn’t necessary.

 Exploring different hays and pasture
 Discovering other types of horse food
 Finding out how often and how much to feed
You know that what you feed your horse is very important or you wouldn’t
be reading this book. But what to feed your horse — that is the question.
Horse feeds come in a number of different shapes, sizes, and textures. Each
one is significantly different in terms of nutritional value and palatability to
the horse.
In this chapter, we describe all the feeds available to horses. You explore
which types of feed are best for your horse given his age, condition, and
workload. How much to feed your horse and how often will no longer be 
mysteries to you.
Hay Now! Choosing Hay for Your Horse
If you horse isn’t on pasture (and most likely he isn’t, simply because you
don’t have the option of keeping him on it), hay is the most important com-
ponent of his diet, after water (see Chapter 6). For this reason, it’s very
important that you buy the best hay you possibly can. Because the quality of
the hay you buy determines how much nutrition your horse gets, it’s vital
that you know how to recognize good hay.

Why choose hay for your horse?
Unless you have a pasture to graze your horse, hay is the best choice of basic
feed for your equine companion. Quality hay provides the horse with all the
carbohydrates he needs to function. It gives him plenty of protein, and just
about all the vitamins and minerals that his body requires. It also provides
vital roughage to his diet, which keeps his digestive system working properly.
(See Chapter 6 for more about all these building blocks of equine nutrition.)
Hay is also less expensive than complete feeds (which we discuss later in this
chapter), and it satisfies the horse’s needs to chew. Watch a horse munching
on hay and you can see how much he enjoys it!
Looking at different types of hay
Everyone knows that horses eat hay. But what is this mysterious stuff that
looks like dried-up sticks but makes horses salivate?
Basically, hay is made up of plants that have been cut, dried, and baled. Each
type of hay usually contains one or two different plants, depending on the
bale. (We discuss different types of hay bales later in this chapter.)
You can buy three different types of hay: legumes, grasses, and cereals. Each
type has different nutritional properties. Where you live, your horse’s individ-
ual needs, and your veterinarian’s advice will help you determine which hays
to feed to your horse.
Legumes
Legume hays (see Figure 7-1) are rich in nutrients and provide plenty of
energy to a horse’s diet. The type of legume hay most available to you
depends on where you live.
 Alfalfa is one of the most commonly fed legumes, and you can purchase
it in many parts of the U.S., particularly the West. Most horses love it,
although it has to be fed with some care because of its high calcium
level in relation to phosphorus. You don’t want to create an imbalance of
these important minerals in your horse; doing so will risk the health of
your horse’s bones.
An excellent source of protein and carbohydrates, quality alfalfa usually
provides more protein than horses actually need — a whopping 18 per-
cent. (Horses typically need 10 percent protein in their diets.) High pro-
tein content is especially seen in dairy-grade alfalfa, which is harvested to
be fed to dairy cattle. Alfalfa that’s cut earlier in the growing season has
less protein, so it’s more suited as feed for horses; your hay supplier can
tell you when your hay was cut. (When horses get too much protein, they
urinate a lot and can become unmanageable because of excess energy.)
108
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Clover is another legume hay that’s often fed, and one that horses espe-
cially like. When eating it, they often select the most highly palatable
clovers from the hay. This hay has a high energy content, and is a good
hay for horses who get a lot of exercise. Different types of clover hay can
be found throughout the United States.
Grasses
Grass hays (see Figure 7-2) are generally lower in protein content than
legume hays, and also provide less lysine (an important amino acid) than
legume hays. Some experts believe that you should feed both a legume hay
and a grass hay together, although coauthor Audrey and many other horse
owners feed their horses only grass hay and they do just fine.

Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals

The fiber content of grass hays is pretty high compared to other types of
hays. These hays are usually lower in vitamin E than legume hays.
Common grass hays that make good food for horses include orchardgrass,
coastal Bermuda, brome, bluegrass, fescue, and timothy.
 Orchardgrass grows tall in cool seasons. It offers 8 to 13 percent protein,
depending on when it’s cut. Coastal Bermuda has a 10 percent protein
content. Brome has 12 percent protein, and bluegrass has 10 percent.
 Fescue has 11.8 percent protein, but be cautious when feeding it. Many
tall fescue grasses contain a fungal endophyte (a plant parasite) that
grows inside the plant but has no visible symptoms in the plant. This
organism can cause reproductive problems in pregnant mares, abortion,
poor milk production, retained placentas, and reduced growth rates in
young growing horses. If you want to feed fescue, look for hay labeled
“endophyte-free.”
 Of all the grass hays, timothy is the highest in calcium and contains a
greater amount of vitamins A and D. Timothy has a protein content of 
7 to 11 percent.
All the grass hays mentioned here have good nutritional value and can be fed
in unlimited amounts to horses, as long as it doesn’t cause a weight problem.
Cereals
Cereal hays get their name from the grain heads that grow as part of the 
harvested plant. These hays aren’t fed to horses very often because they can
be hard to come by and don’t hold their nutrition very long. (After the grain
heads fall off as the hay matures, what’s left is essentially straw, which has no
nutritional value to horses.) Some horses rely on these hays for their prime
source of roughage, however, because they can’t eat legume or grass hays
because of allergies or digestion problems.
Here are three popular cereal hays:
 Oat: Oat hay is the most commonly fed cereal hay and can be a good
choice for older horses because of its lower protein level — 9.5 percent —
when compared to legume and grass hays. (Older horses often have trou-
ble metabolizing protein and produce large quantities of urine if they’re
fed a higher protein hay.) One problem with oat hay is that many horses
eat only the grain heads and leave the stems behind.
 Barley: This hay has a protein level of 9 percent. It can be lower in nutri-
tional value than some other hays. For this reason, feed this hay only if
your vet recommends it. She may also suggest that a vitamin and min-
eral supplement be fed in conjunction with barley hay (see Chapter 6 for
more information on vitamins and minerals.)
110
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Wheat: With a protein content of 8.5 percent, wheat hay is high in fiber
and can be a good choice for horses who can’t eat legume or grass hays.
It can be lower in calcium than these other hays, however, so lactating
mares and growing foals may need a calcium supplement. Discuss this
issue with your veterinarian.
Distinguishing between different 
types of bales
Hay that has been harvested and prepared for sale comes in two different
forms: square bales and round bales. Hay bales also come in small and 
large sizes:
 Small rectangular bales weighing 50 to 125 pounds are the most common
bale size. These bales are great for most horse owners because they’re
easy to handle and transport. Small rectangular bales are divided up into
individual flakes, which makes them easy to feed in small increments.
(The weight of each flake varies considerably from bale to bale and
among different hay types.)
 Large rectangular bales and large round bales are also available, weigh-
ing from 800 to 1,200 pounds. These huge bales are practical for horse
owners who have a lot of horses to feed, and can help minimize cost 
and labor. These large bales are usually placed in a pasture or paddock
inside special feeders made specifically for them so that they don’t sit in
accumulated rainwater. The feeders also help minimize waste by catch-
ing the hay that comes off the bale as the horses are eating. (We talk
about basic feeders later in this chapter.)
Large bales made up of grass hay are a good choice for a group of
horses. However, coauthor Dr. Kate doesn’t recommend feeding big
alfalfa bales to horses at all unless you can effectively keep the big bales
dry and covered (alfalfa molds quickly in damp weather) and are willing
to tear the bales apart for feeding. (Horses shouldn’t have free access to
alfalfa hay because they’ll get fat!)
Keep the following in mind when you’re feeding your horse from a bale: You
don’t know whether anything else is in that bale besides just hay. Foreign
objects such as trash or even dead and decaying rodents are occasionally
found in hay bales. You’re more likely to find these potential dangers when
you’re hand-feeding small square bales, so you can discard that bale if
needed. Consider this just another opportunity to prevent your horse from
swallowing something that can be potentially harmful.
111
Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals

Evaluating hay quality
Picking up the phone and ordering hay from the feed store or just trusting
the boarding stable to give your horse whatever it buys from its supplier is
so easy. But if you really care about the quality of your horse’s diet, you
should get more involved by personally evaluating your horse’s hay.
You should consider a number of factors when evaluating hay, including the
following:
 Color: The ideal hay color is green. Beta carotene is greater when hay is
green. A beige or brown color can indicate that the hay has been
bleached and rain has leached nutrients after the cutting.
 Texture: The hay should be soft, leafy, and without lots of stems.
 Condition: It should be fresh, dry, free of dust, and without any trace 
of mold.
 Age: Buy hay that was harvested during the current year, if possible.
(Ask you supplier for this information.) If you must buy older hay, be
certain that it was properly stored in a covered and dry environment.
(Many vitamins degrade with time, and old hay may not provide the
amounts of vitamins your horse needs.)
 Weed content: Some weeds present in hay present no problems at all,
and most hay bales contain some weeds. But too many weeds affect the
palatability and nutrition of the hay you’re feeding.
Be careful not to mistake bright green weeds for alfalfa. Even though
they’re green, these weeds have a lower nutrient content than brown
alfalfa.
 Bug free: Inspect alfalfa hay for blister beetles. Even just one of these
tiny little beetles, which are sometimes accidentally baled in hay, can
cause fatalities in horses. They’re often found in alfalfa hay grown in
areas that don’t have a hard winter freeze. If your alfalfa comes from
such an area, make sure that the hay producer sprays for blister beetles.
(If you’re buying your alfalfa from a feed store, ask whether blister beetle
prevention was taken.)
Be prepared to see hay prices go up and down. The cost of hay varies greatly
depending upon availability (hay costs skyrocket during drought years). You
may pay anywhere from $3 a bale to $25 a bale, depending on where you live
and what type of hay you’re buying. Hay can quadruple in cost within a year
when demand exceeds supply. Feeding poor-quality hay to try to save money
can cost you plenty in terms of gastrointestinal upsets and poor health.
112
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

If you have your own horse property and plenty of storage, buy a year’s
worth of hay at a time, all from one source. Then, have your hay analyzed by
your county extension agent for a small fee, and build your nutrition program
based on your hay. The analysis tells you the amount of protein and total
digestible nitrogen (TDN) in your hay. You find out how much “bang” you’re
getting for your hay buck. On the other hand, if you board your horse at a
stable, you have little control over the hay your horse is getting. Some sta-
bles do allow owners to supply their own hay, so if you don’t like the quality
of the hay your horse is getting, discuss the possibility of supplying hay with
management.
Storing hay
If you keep your horse — and your horse’s hay — on your property, storing it
properly is vital. Proper storage involves keeping it dry and free from dust
and mold.
Water is your hay’s worst enemy, so keeping it out of the rain is paramount.
Store your hay indoors if you can. If you don’t have a barn or garage where
you can keep it, cover it with a tarp before it rains. Don’t cover it with a tarp
after it rains, however, because this encourages mold to grow. Instead, open
the bales and spread the flakes out to dry. If you find mold on your hay, bite
the bullet and throw it away. Feeding moldy hay can cause respiratory prob-
lems in horses, as well as colic (see Chapter 11 for more information about
these issues).
113
Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals
Hay and pasture help from a pro
A great way to learn about hay and pasture is
through your county extension office. Extension
agents — who can be found in every county in
the country by looking in your telephone direc-
tory under “Government” — can show you
examples of forages, and even possibly direct
you to a local college that may have an animal
husbandry course that has lots of great info.
Many extension offices offer regular seminars
on how to live in the country, designed to edu-
cate new livestock owners about how to take
care of their animals. At these seminars, you get
to see the types of hay and pasture that are
common in your area.

When storing hay, keep it elevated off the ground where moisture can accu-
mulate. Wooden pallets are great for this. They keep your hay off the ground,
and can be found for free or minimal cost at many big box stores and home
repair centers.
Grazing Time: Providing 
Pasture for Your Horse
If you have access to pasture, you and your horse are fortunate. Pasture is
the best thing for your horse because it’s the most natural environment for
her. Horses evolved to graze, and pasture enables them to do that. Pasture
that’s well planted and maintained can also provide horses with excellent
nutrition. However, keep in mind that poor pasture or toxic pasture is much
worse than no pasture at all.
A variety of grasses can be grown for horses, including all the types also
made into hay (which we discuss earlier in this chapter). If you have existing
pasture and want to make sure that it’s good for your horse, read on. If you’re
planning on growing and maintaining your own pasture from scratch, see
Chapter 9 for details.
Why choose pasture for your horse?
When horses live the way nature intended them to, they spend many hours a
day grazing. They walk around, slowly picking their way through the various
plants in their environment, nibbling and chewing as they decide which
pieces to eat and which to leave behind.
When you put your horse on pasture, you give her the opportunity to behave
the way she was born to do. Eating and walking, eating and walking — this is
what horses are really all about. The result of this natural environment is a
happier, healthy horse. If you keep your horse on pasture, she’ll be less likely
to develop stable vices, leg problems, and digestive problems.
Surveying different types of pasture
Pasture grasses come in pretty much the same types as hay. Fescue, orchard-
grass, Bermuda, bluegrass, and brome are all common hays seen in pastures,
depending on which part of the country you’re in.
114
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

As a general rule, grass is the only type of pasture that you want for your
horse. Horses grazed on alfalfa and clover quickly become obese because of
the higher calorie content of these hays. They’re also at greater risk for devel-
oping colic and laminitis when they graze on pasture that’s too rich.
Evaluating pasture
Before you put your horse out on a pasture (either grown on your property
or provided by a boarding facility), you need to make certain that the grass is
of the right quality. The plant species should be appropriate for horses, and
no toxic weeds should be growing among the pasture plants. (You can find
out about the grass quality by contacting your county extension agent.)
You also need to know how productive the pasture is. Vibrantly green, lush-
looking acreage can be full of weeds and plants that your horse won’t eat.
Horses have been known to starve standing knee-deep in what an owner mis-
takenly thought was edible grass. If you aren’t sure of the productivity of
your pasture, ask your extension agent for help.
Pastures change with the seasons. Quick growth in the spring — with plants
full of water after a lot of rain — has a different nutritional value than the
same pasture in the fall with mature grasses that have concentrated sugars
and nutrients. This latter growth, although more nutritious for the horse, can
also be less palatable.
To make your late-season pasture grass more palatable, manage your pasture
correctly all through the season. Keep manure piles down by removing them or
spreading. Mow stands of mature grass. Practice good rotational grazing, and
keep weeds under control at all times so good grass doesn’t have to compete.
Switching your horse from hay to pasture
The equine digestive system doesn’t take well to sudden changes in diet. So if
your horse has been eating hay only and now has access to pasture, you
need to make the change gradually.
Start by allowing your horse to graze for one hour a day on the pasture, while
continuing to feed her a normal diet of hay. Do this for three days in a row.
Then extend the grazing time to two hours per day for a few days as you
reduce the amount of hay she’s getting (talk to your vet about how much 
to cut back). Using this system, gradually work your way up to having 
your horse spend all day on pasture with little or no hay supplementation,
depending on the quality of your pasture. (Your vet can tell you if your horse
still needs hay.)
115
Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals

If horses aren’t used to being on pasture, they sometimes gorge themselves
when you first introduce them to this new type of feed. Watch to make sure
that your horse isn’t grabbing huge mouthfuls and not really chewing before
swallowing. If she is, leave her on pasture for only 30 minutes a day to start
with and go up in 30-minute increments.
If your horse begins to grow fat while she’s on pasture, reduce the amount of
time she spends grazing. Pasture grass can be richer in the spring when it’s
new, so though your horse may need to graze less in the spring to keep her
weight down, she may be okay grazing all day in the fall.
Lush green grass can be a cause of colic or laminitis. In some areas of the
country, many horses shouldn’t be turned out on pastures during the early
grass-growing season for more than 30 minutes per day, if at all. It may be
safer to start acclimating your horse to the pasture when the summer starts
and the pasture growth slows.
Considering Other Feeds
The staples of your horse’s diet should be hay and/or pasture. You can add
other feeds as well, depending on your horse’s situation. Your veterinarian
can guide you on which types of the following feeds, if any, you should give to
your horse.
Grains for active horses
“He’s feeling his oats!” You may have heard this expression, which harkens
back to the days when horses were everywhere and cars had yet to be
invented.
Oats and other grains like corn and barley have become synonymous with
vigor in horses, and with good reason. These feedstuffs provide plenty of 
carbohydrates, which convert into energy in the horse’s body:
 Oats: Of all the grains, oats provide the greatest nutritional boost.
They’re a good source of fiber and much less likely to develop mold or
mycotoxins than other grains. Oats don’t have to be processed at all for
horses to get the available nutrition, and because they aren’t processed,
they don’t spoil as easily as corn or barley.
116
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Corn: Corn is now the most popular type of grain fed to horses because
it’s inexpensive and provides a lot of energy. It’s nutritious and very
palatable to horses. It should be fed in moderation, though (your vet 
can tell you how much is right for your horse). Because corn doesn’t
have a hull, it’s lower in fiber than oats, but it’s also higher in density
and digestible energy than oats. One pound of corn has twice the energy
of one pound of oats.
Overfeeding corn can cause laminitis, colic, and diarrhea (see Chapter 11
for more information about these issues). Corn also is more expensive
than oats and barley.
 Barley: Barley has the same protein content as grass hay and should 
be fed only in rolled or crushed form. The most widely cultivated of all
cereal grains in the world, it looks similar to oats but is very hard and
therefore more difficult for horses to chew. It’s also less palatable than
oats or corn. Buy barley that has been crimped or rolled because it’s
easier to chew.
Barley has more fiber than corn and more energy density than oats.
However, less of its starch is digested in the small intestine, so you
should feed it with caution to avoid founder. Your vet can tell you how
much is right for your horse.
Grain may not be necessary to your horse’s diet. In fact, if you don’t do 
too much with your horse, he probably doesn’t need grain included in his
daily rations. Giving him grain gives him more energy, and if you don’t ride
him much, all that energy may be channeled into unwanted behavior (like
spooking).
Complete feeds for the old and young
Complete feeds (see Figure 7-3) are commercially prepared diets that contain
all the nutrients horses need to survive. These types of feeds are usually
given to older horses. Senior horse diets, which are labeled specifically for
use in older horses, are designed to meet the special needs of older horses
who may have dental issues and require a diet that can be easily chewed 
and assimilated. (See Chapter 17 for details on caring for senior horses.)
Complete feeds are also used for weanlings and for horses who have certain
medical conditions (such as equine metabolic syndrome; see Chapter 11)
that require a closely monitored diet.
117
Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals

Some horse owners use complete feeds to mix with supplements (see
Chapter 8) or medications (see Chapter 13). These feeds tend to be very
tasty to horses, making them more willing to take their medicine if it’s 
disguised within a bucket of complete feed.
Healthy adult horses shouldn’t be fed an exclusive diet of complete feed.
Even though these feeds are nutritionally complete, the horse’s innate need
to chew and biological need for roughage dictates that some kind of forage be
a significant part of the horse’s diet.
Before you give your horse a commercial feed, it’s important to read the feed-
ing instructions and nutritional information on the bag. Consult with your
veterinarian and your feed dealer to know what you’re buying and whether
it’s appropriate for your horse. For example, some senior feeds are formu-
lated to include roughage and may need to be fed in greater volume to pro-
vide a horse with adequate forage intake. Other senior feeds are formulated
to be fed in conjunction with pasture or hay.
You get what you pay for when it comes to commercial feed. The cheapest
bag of feed may be just that. Many vitamins degrade with time, and feed that
has been sitting in a warehouse before appearing at a discount farm supply
store may not contain all the nutrition it once did. Also, cheaper prepared
feeds tend to use cost-based rations rather than a recipe-based formulation;
the ingredients listed on the feed tag can be included in any amount that will
contain the listed amounts of protein, fat, and fiber if the feed were to be ana-
lyzed in a laboratory. Therefore, the actual ingredients may vary from one
batch of feed to another.

needs.

Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Feeds for special circumstances
Over the centuries, horsemen have developed a lot of different types of feeds
for horses. Each of these has different reasons for being fed, and may be of
use to you and your horse in certain situations. Some special feeds include:
 Hay pellets: Made from either grass hay or alfalfa that’s finely ground
and pressed into 3⁄4-inch pellets, this form of hay is a type of concen-
trated feed. It’s an ideal choice when a horse is suffering from a respira-
tory ailment that makes him sensitive to the dust found in baled hay.
Hay pellets (see Figure 7-4) are cheap to feed but shouldn’t make up 
the main part of your horse’s diet because they lack roughage and don’t
satisfy the horse’s urge to chew. In fact, horses fed a diet of only pellets
can develop stall vices like cribbing and wood chewing. (See Chapter 3
for more information on stable vices.) Pellets also aren’t good for the
horse’s digestive tract, and when they’re dry, they can cause choking;
soak them before feeding.
 Hay cubes: Concentrated blocks of coarsely chopped hay, usually 2 x 
1 1⁄2 inches in size, are called hay cubes. They’re easy to store and trans-
port, and can be good for senior horses who have trouble chewing hay
because the cubes break easily. (Some types of hay cube producers rec-
ommend soaking cubes in water before feeding to make them softer.)
Horses with respiratory problems can benefit from a diet of cubes as
well because they’re less dusty than baled hay. Cubes are also good at
putting weight on horses who have trouble keeping meat on their bones.
Cubes aren’t the ideal diet for a healthy horse, however, because they
don’t satisfy the horse’s need to chew.
 Beet pulp: High in protein, beet pulp is a byproduct of the table sugar
industry. The sweet stuff is removed from the sugar beet, leaving the
sugarless pulp behind. Horses like beet pulp, and when soaked, it can
make a good treat for mixing supplements or medication. Some people
feed it to help put weight on horses who are perpetually thin.
 Bran: Bran is a popular treat for horses who live in cold climates. Horses
love a warm bran mash on cold days and owners love to provide it.
(Warm, soupy bran mixed with pieces of carrot and apple is the earthly
equivalent of heaven for a horse.) Although bran is fine as an occasional
treat, it’s not beneficial on a regular basis. The hull of the grain left over
after milling (usually wheat or rice), bran has very little nutritional
value. It also can cause impaction if it’s fed regularly and then abruptly
discontinued.
119
Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals

These other feeds are fine on occasion or under special circumstances, 
but should never take the place of hay or pasture as the basis for your
horse’s diet.
Feeding Your Horse Properly
If you want your horse to be healthy and happy, you should do everything
you can to provide an environment that’s as close to nature as possible.
Horses are best off when they can live the way they evolved to do over time.
When it comes to feeding, you have the opportunity to mimic the horse’s nat-
ural environment in a few different ways, including providing feeding at the
right frequency and in the right amounts.
The right frequency
Because horses were designed to eat for about 18 hours a day, the more often
you can feed your horse, the better. The exact frequency of feeding depends
on whether your horse eats hay or pasture:
 If your horse is stabled and eating hay, feed her at least twice a day —
more if possible. Break up her daily ration into smaller portions so that
she has less time between meals. Try to feed around the same time each
day, too. Horses seem to have an internal clock that lets them know
when it’s feeding time, and they can become quite stressed if the food
doesn’t come when it’s supposed to, especially if they’re confined to
stalls and don’t have much to do all day.
Figure 7-4:
Hay pellets
should be
given only
as a treat.
120
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 If your horse is on pasture, let her graze as much as possible. If your
pasture has a shelter, she can be on it round-the-clock regardless of the
weather. This is the most natural situation for a horse.
The right amount at each feeding time
For your horse’s digestive tract to function at its best, she should consume 
a minimum of 1 to 2 percent of her body weight per day in long-stem dry
matter, either pasture or hay. That means that the typical 1,000-pound horse
should eat 10 to 20 pounds of forage daily.
If you aren’t sure how much your horse weighs, buy a weight tape from your
local tack-and-feed store. This tape allows you to measure your horse’s girth
and find her approximate weight. See Chapter 2 for details on figuring your
horse’s weight.
The weight of a flake of hay varies from bale to bale (see Figure 7-5), so it’s
important to get a sense of how heavy a flake is before you feed it to your
horse.
Figure 7-5:
A flake
varies 
in size,
depending
on the bale
and type 
of hay.
121
Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals

In most cases, the amount of hours per day that your horse spends on pasture
determines how much pasture grass she’s consuming. Watch your horse’s
weight closely. If she’s gaining weight, she may be getting too much pasture. 
If she’s losing weight, she may not be getting enough to eat. Ask your veteri-
narian to help you evaluate your horse’s condition when she’s on pasture.
The right feeders
You see all kinds of feeders for horses on the market. The type of feeder you
buy is determined in large part by your horse’s enclosure. If you have your
horse in a pasture with other horses and feed from a large bale, you need a
big bale feeder. If your horse lives in a stall, you need a stall feeder.
Because horses are meant to eat with their heads down, using a feeder that
enables the horse to eat close to the ground is best (see Figure 7-6). You
don’t want to put the hay directly on the ground because it encourages the
horse to pick up dirt as she eats, which in turn can cause sand colic. (See
Chapter 11 for more on this problem.)

Feeders at ground level come in a variety of different styles, so simply pick
one that appeals to you (you can ask your vet for advice on the safest types
of ground feeders). Coauthor Audrey likes to feed her horses from big black
rubber bins that are attached to a corner of the paddock.

Chapter 7: Your Hungry Horse: Feeding Fundamentals
Breaking down the significance of enzymes
Horses are nonruminant herbivores (they don’t
chew cud and they eat only plants), and derive
their nutrition from forages. How? With the help
of important elements called enzymes. They’re
responsible for helping the horse break down all
that tough feed (have you ever chewed on a
piece of hay?). The reason enzymes are impor-
tant is a bit complicated, but if you’re a horse
owner, understanding the biology behind it is a
good idea.
Here’s how it works: Forages that horses eat
have two carbohydrate components: soluble
and insoluble. Soluble carbs are broken down
into packets of energy by digestive enzymes
that break bonds between the glucose mole-
cules. The horse himself makes these digestive
enzymes, which are very specific in the job that
they do. When the enzymes break down soluble
carbs, the carbs are absorbed in the small intes-
tine along with minerals, vitamins, fats, and pro-
teins. But the insoluble carbs, which the horse
can’t digest so easily, pass along into the 
fermentation vat known as the cecum.
Horses don’t have the enzymes necessary to
break down insoluble carbs, but they do have a
great relationship with many different species
of microorganisms that do have the enzymes
that can break down insoluble carbs. Previously
unusable food stuff can be used by both the
microbe and the horse. The result of this fer-
mentation is the production of energy packets
called volatile fatty acids (or VFAs), certain
microbial proteins, other digestive enzymes,
and vitamins like vitamin K and B vitamins.
These microbe populations can be rather unsta-
ble, especially in horses who are stressed, or
who quickly change from one diet to another as
in the case of grain overload. These circum-
stances can cause changes in the microbial
environment. And if the change is rapid and sig-
nificant, a large number of these beneficial
microbes die, often with dire consequences.
Here’s an example of what can happen when
the upset occurs: The resident microbe popula-
tion is happily doing its job, digesting a diet of
primarily hay with a small amount of grain.
Suddenly, there’s big change. The horse gets
out of his stall, wanders into the feed room, and
eats a large amount of grain. Some of the grain
is digested by the small intestine, and a small
amount of soluble carbs are absorbed, but
because the horse’s stomach is very small, the
excess soluble carbs speed through the small
intestine undigested and land in the cecum.
The microbes aren’t prepared for this upset, but
some bacteria thrive on the sudden change of
food, and begin to multiply. The excess produc-
tion of lactate by these organisms changes the
acidity of the environment, causing death to a
lot of other bacteria. When some of those bac-
teria die, they release endotoxins, which are
absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause
laminitis, colic, and — if severe enough —
death.
Keeping your horse’s enzymes balanced by
making only slow and gradual introductions to
new feed is vital. And because stress can cause
an upset in the microbial population of your
horse’s digestive system, the use of probiotics
in stressful situations can help keep your horse
healthy. For more information on supplementing
your horse with probiotics, see Chapter 8.

Choosing to feed alone or in a herd
If your horse lives in a pasture or in a paddock with other horses, she’s part
of a herd situation. If she eats only pasture grass, you don’t need to worry
about whether to feed her alone or with the group because she’s already
eating with company. If your horse eats hay and lives in a large paddock 
with other horses, however, you need to decide whether you want to feed 
her separately. Although horses enjoy eating together, they also become 
territorial about their food. Because herds have a hierarchy, one or more
horses inevitably become the low men on the totem pole and end up being
chased away from the food.
If your horse is getting picked on when she tries to eat with the group — or if
she’s bullying another horse — it’s a good idea to separate her at mealtimes.
You can feed her in a stall and wait until she and the other horses have fin-
ished before returning her to the herd.

Special Considerations for 
Your Horse’s Diet
In This Chapter
 Exploring dietary supplements
 Rehabilitating horses with weight issues
 Feeding horses with allergies
 Changing behavior with diet
You know that hay or pasture is the basis of your horse’s diet, and that
you can add grain or other goodies if you so choose. (If you’re not so
sure, you can glean all this and more from Chapter 7.) But what if your horse
has special circumstances? Can you do anything that’s diet-related to help a
horse with health or behavioral problems?
The answer is a resounding yes. In this chapter, we give you the lowdown on
those dietary supplements that fill tack-and-feed store shelves. We also give
you pointers on how to safely slim down a fat horse (or bulk up a skinny
horse) and how to control equine allergies with diet. And last, but not least,
we take a look at behavioral issues and how you can manage them with diet.
The Skinny on Dietary Supplements
If you’ve ever gone into a tack-and-feed store, you’ve seen The Supplements.
They usually take up one or two entire aisles, and they have names and func-
tions that you never even imagined would exist.
How are you to know whether your horse needs any of this stuff? And how are
you to know how to shop for and feed supplements to your horse? We can
help you with that — read through the information in the following sections.

Determining when supplements 
truly are necessary
Here’s our philosophy on supplements: If your horse is generally healthy, if
you spend your money on the best food for your horse (see Chapter 7 to find
out what that is), and if you work and train her properly, you probably don’t
need any dietary supplements. (In fact, doing so may cause an imbalance in
her body and even toxicity.) You need only one rule for the equine diet: Keep
it simple.
Many people underestimate the activity levels of their horses; this can lead
to not conditioning or exercising their horses enough to be competitive in
whatever activity they like to do with their horses, such as showing,
endurance, barrel racing, and so on. These folks try to make up the difference
with supplements. No supplement is going to make a winner out of an aver-
age horse, or one who isn’t in good physical condition. That said, if you want
to try some supplements on your horse and see whether they improve her
performance, keep flies away, or make her coat shine like a diamond, go right
ahead. Just remember that certain vitamins and minerals can cause real
problems if given to excess. (Read Chapter 6 to find out which vitamins and
minerals can cause problems.)
Here are some situations where a horse may genuinely benefit from supple-
ments (see the following section for the scoop on the different types of 
supplements we mention):
 While in training: Joint supplements may be useful because the horse’s
joints are being stressed. Antioxidants may be something to consider
too, as long as you don’t overdo the vitamin A. (See Chapter 6 for details
on vitamin A.)
 While under high stress: Stress makes it difficult for the body to prop-
erly absorb nutrients. Horses undergoing extreme stress, like being
shipped long distances or traveling extensively on a show circuit, may
benefit from a vitamin supplement.
 While pregnant: The last third of a mare’s pregnancy is very taxing on
her body. Vitamin supplements designed for broodmares can be helpful
at this time of gestation. (See Chapter 15 for more details on caring for
pregnant mares.)
 While nursing: Nursing mares put out a lot of vitamins and energy to
their foals in the form of milk. Vitamin supplements designed for lactat-
ing mares can help them stay in good condition during this time.
126
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 While eating poorly: Horses who aren’t eating much because they suffer
from a chronic illness probably aren’t getting all the vitamins they need.
A supplement may be warranted in this case.
 While eating marginal hay: If you can’t get good hay for part of the year
because of a lack of supply due to weather or other issues beyond your
supplier’s control, you can supplement with vitamins and minerals.
(Also consider using a good quality pelleted feed or hay cubes instead;
we discuss these options in Chapter 7.)
 While in the senior years: Geriatric horses may benefit from vitamin
and joint supplements. See Chapter 17 for more details on this.
 While having hoof problems: Horses with hoof problems (such as those
in Chapter 11) may benefit from a hoof supplement containing biotin.
First, be certain that you’ve ruled out any environmental causes such as
overly dry conditions or stabling in shavings; both of these situations
cause feet to dry out and become brittle.
 While recovering from illness: Horses who have been sick or suffering
from an infection can benefit from supplements containing probiotics or
prebiotics, especially if the horse has been on antibiotics.
• Probiotics contain the beneficial organisms that live in the horse’s
digestive tract and are necessary to proper function. Illness or the
use of antibiotics can disturb the balance of these bacteria.
• Prebiotics are nutrients that encourage those beneficial bacteria 
to grow.
Your veterinarian can advise you about the use of probiotics or prebi-
otics in your horse.
If you’re not sure whether you should be giving your horse a supplement for
any of the preceding situations, don’t hesitate to discuss your concerns with
your veterinarian.
Surveying different types of supplements
Keeping track of supplements is difficult, because so much variety exists.
Here are some of the most popular and useful types of supplement products
that are out there:
 Hoof: Strong hooves are something that every horse owner desires, 
and you can find several supplements designed to make hooves grow
tougher. They usually contain a type of vitamin B called biotin, which 
is believed to contribute to hoof growth.
127
Chapter 8: Special Considerations for Your Horse’s Diet

 Joint: Supplements designed to help maintain healthy joints are proba-
bly the most abundant type of supplement on the market. Most of these
products contain a combination of different ingredients, several of
which may increase joint mobility.
• Many joint supplements contain the compounds of glucosamine
and chondroitin. Some also contain methylsulfonylmethane
(MSM). We use joint supplements containing these ingredients
because some of these products have been scientifically proven to
work. Coauthor Audrey uses them for her senior Quarter Horse
gelding, and coauthor Dr. Kate uses them for a number of her per-
formance horses.
• Other ingredients such as yucca and devil’s claw, which are both
natural anti-inflammatories, are sometimes used in joint supple-
ments. Although no double-blind scientific studies have been 
done to prove that these ingredients help joints, enough anec-
dotal evidence exists to make adding these to your horse’s diet 
a consideration.
 Vitamins: Just like humans take vitamins, so can horses. The difference
is that if your horse is eating a quality diet of hay or pasture and has no
special needs, she really doesn’t need a vitamin supplement. However,
your horse may need a vitamin supplement in certain situations, such as
pregnancy (see the previous section).
Other types of supplements on the market include the following:
 Allergy: Horses can get allergies just like people do, and some supple-
ments purport to help them with allergic symptoms. These supplements
contain antihistamines, or all-natural ingredients designed to reduce
inflammation. (We discuss other options for helping horses with aller-
gies later in this chapter.)
 Calming: Supplements to help nervous horses contain anything from vit-
amin B to valerian root to L-tryptophan. All these natural ingredients
have been shown anecdotally to relax the nervous system. Just be sure
that your horse isn’t nervous because of fixable issues like poor training,
wrong diet, lack of exercise, or a stressful environment before you dose
him with calming supplements.
If you show your horse, be aware that some of the ingredients in these
supplements will cause your horse to test positive on horse show drug
tests, resulting in disqualification.
 Electrolytes: For horses who work hard and sweat a lot, electrolyte sup-
plements are meant to replace electrolytes lost from the horse’s body.
128
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Fly control: Natural supplements meant to keep flies at bay may contain
powdered garlic. Garlic is purported to be unpleasant to flies, and
horses who eat these supplements are supposed to be less attractive 
to the flying pests.
 Skin and coat: Every horse owner wants a horse with healthy skin and a
glowing coat, and these supplements are designed to provide just that.
They often contain different oils and minerals that are supposed to
foster a healthy skin and coat.
 Weight gain: Some of these supplements, designed for underweight
horses, contain high-calorie ingredients to help the horse gain weight.
Others are made up of natural ingredients meant to promote healthy
metabolism.
Supplements exist for just about every equine condition you can imagine. If
your horse is in need of a particular supplement, your veterinarian will prob-
ably recommend one. If you see a supplement for sale that you think may be
helpful to your horse, ask your vet about it.
Choosing a quality supplement
When you’re shopping for dietary supplements, things can get tricky. Here
are some guidelines:
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t control supplement
labels on equine products, so determining the quality of the ingredients
or the product is difficult. One way around this is to look for a seal on
the label that says NASC. Short for National Animal Supplement Council,
the NASC seal indicates that the ingredients in the product meet certain
standards for quality.
 If you find that you can’t clearly understand what’s in the product or
what levels of ingredients are inside without having to use a calculator,
you should be concerned.
 Unrealistic claims as to speedy results or the effects of the product indi-
cate that the manufacturer isn’t being truthful. For example, don’t trust a
supplement that says it can cure something.
 Don’t be fooled by higher and higher levels of active ingredients. Horses
can assimilate only so much. The rest of the ingredients will be wasted —
as will the extra money that you’re paying for the higher dose.
129
Chapter 8: Special Considerations for Your Horse’s Diet

If you aren’t sure of the quality or quantity of a supplement that you’re con-
sidering, talk to your horse’s veterinarian. He or she is the best one to give
you advice on this subject.
Feeding supplements to your equine friend
Most supplements are designed to be palatable to horses, who can be notori-
ously fussy about what they eat. Some supplements can be fed directly to the
horse, added to pelleted feed, or given as a paste.
Follow the manufacturer’s directions on the label when it comes to adminis-
tering the supplement you want to give to your horse:
 If the label recommends that the supplement be a “top dressing” to 
feed, simply mix it with a commercial pelleted feed or hay pellets (see
Figure 8-1).
 If the supplement is in a powder form, add it to a pelleted feed, mix in 
a little water, and stir the mixture before serving it to your horse (see
Figure 8-2).
 A paste supplement calls for administering the paste directly into the
horse’s mouth with a syringe (see Figure 8-3). You do this by tying your
horse securely by his halter and placing the tip of the syringe into his
mouth. Depress the syringe plunger so the product goes into the horse’s
mouth and onto his tongue.

Chapter 8: Special Considerations for Your Horse’s Diet

Helping Horses with Weight Problems
Horses love to eat, no doubt about it. Put food in front of a healthy horse, and
it’s gone in no time. This penchant for chowing down serves the horse well in
the wild, where food is scarce. But in captivity, when horses are given foods
that are much higher in calories than the food that they’d find in nature, they
can easily put on weight. Some horses are “hard keepers,” however. This
means that no matter how much they eat, they can’t maintain a healthy
weight. Both of these types of horses need specialized feeding programs.
Chubby equines
Being overweight is bad for your health, whether you’re a human or a horse.
Here are just a few dangers facing overweight horses:
 Too much weight on a horse puts considerable stress on his joints and
can result in premature arthritis, or can aggravate existing arthritis and
other joint problems. (See Chapter 11 for more information on arthritis.)
Overweight horses can end up permanently unsound before their time
as a result of their excess weight.
132
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 
The magic of good food
To illustrate how much a good diet matters to
your horse’s well-being (and to prove that you
really don’t need all kinds of supplements if your
horse is being well fed), coauthor Dr. Kate tells
a story of how she recently began riding with a
new instructor to help improve her basic riding
skills. The instructor has been everywhere and
won everything at top levels in the American
Quarter Horse Association world.
Upon arriving at Dr. Kate’s 30-acre cutting horse
ranch in Texas, the instructor was very impressed
at how Dr. Kate’s horses’ coats gleamed even
though they’re out in the hot sun all day. The
instructor wanted to know what kind of supple-
ments Dr. Kate was feeding her horses.
When Dr. Kate showed the instructor the alfalfa
and hay mix that she feeds her horses, along
with the pasture they graze on, the instructor
wouldn’t believe it. After being at Dr. Kate’s
ranch for several weeks, she finally got it. Dr.
Kate’s horses get to be outside on pasture, and
they’re worked hard but they’re not stressed. In
short, Dr. Kate does everything that she and
coauthor Audrey promote in this book. And it
works.

 Even worse than arthritis, overweight horses are at great risk for lamini-
tis. This crippling disease causes the horse’s coffin bone to rotate inside
his hoof, rendering him lame, sometimes for life. (See Chapter 11 for
more details on laminitis.)
 Overweight horses also are at risk of developing equine metabolic 
syndrome. (See Chapter 11 for more details on this illness.) Though
much research is currently being done concerning this condition, a high
starch/carbohydrate diet and subsequent development of insulin resis-
tance is thought to be involved.
Horses who have too much poundage on their bones need help getting the
weight off safely. Because the equine digestive system is designed to be con-
stantly functioning, you can’t just cut back solely on the amount of food you
feed if you hope to take weight off your horse. You also need to change what
you’re feeding him.
Keep the following considerations in mind when you’re dealing with an over-
weight horse:
 Some illnesses can cause a horse to gain weight no matter what he’s
eating. If your horse starts to become fat without an increase in his feed
or a decrease in his exercise, contact your veterinarian before you
change anything regarding his lifestyle. (In fact, be sure to talk to your
vet before you make changes to your horse’s diet for any reason.)
 If your horse is very overweight, ask your veterinarian to help you
develop an exercise and feeding program for your horse. The vet should
take into consideration the horse’s current level of fitness, age, any
soundness issues, and current body condition score. Flip to Chapter 5
for general information on exercising your horse.
See Chapter 2 for details on determining whether your horse is underweight,
overweight, or at a normal weight.
Changing feed
If you read through Chapter 6, you know that certain types of horse food con-
tain more fats and carbohydrates than others. If your horse is overweight,
take a look at what you’re feeding him:
 Grains: The first thing you should consider is grain. If you horse does
only light or moderate exercise, and you’re feeding him grain, that may
be your problem right there. Grain — especially corn — is high in fats
and carbohydrates, and can cause a horse to put on weight quickly.
133
Chapter 8: Special Considerations for Your Horse’s Diet

A horse on a light or moderate work schedule likely doesn’t need grain,
so eliminating or reducing the amount may be the right move. (Talk to
your vet about how much you should cut down.) If you’re using grain to
mix with supplements or medications, substitute a lower-carbohydrate
option, such as a complete feed that’s low in carbs and with no added
molasses, and cut back on the amount you give.
 Hay: If your horse is eating legumes like alfalfa hay or clover, his weight
problem may be a result of these higher-energy hays. Your horse likely
isn’t getting enough exercise to be eating this type of hay, so he needs
something lower in carbs. A grass hay is a great substitution because it
provides needed protein with fewer carbohydrates.
 Pasture: If your overweight horse is on pasture and you don’t have
another option as far as the type of forage that he’s eating, consider con-
fining him off the pasture for a few hours a day to see whether it helps
him lose weight. (If you can’t confine him, fit him with a muzzle for a few
hours a day that will allow him to drink but not graze.) If he still doesn’t
lose weight, you’ll have to keep him off the pasture even longer. To keep
him from getting bored, feed him grass hay while he’s confined.
The nutritional and caloric content of pasture changes with the seasons,
so although your horse may get fat eating spring pasture 24 hours a day,
that much fall pasture may not have the same effect on him.
Any changes you make to your horse’s diet must be done gradually. Slowly
introduce new feeds by making the new feed one-quarter of the horse’s diet
for the first three days. Then increase the new feed to one-half of the horse’s
diet. Maintain this amount for three days, and then add enough new feed to
make it three-quarters of your horse’s diet. If you’re substituting a new food
for one you plan to discontinue, continue this for three more days until you
finally switch your horse over completely.
Decreasing feed
Cutting back on a horse’s feed intake to encourage him to lose weight can be
tricky. You don’t want to deprive him of his intrinsic need to chew. You also
don’t want to create a situation where his stomach is empty for much of the
day, because that can lead to colic, ulcers, and stall vices (see Chapter 11).
If you’ve already looked at what you’re feeding your horse (see the previous
section) and have determined that he’s simply getting too much food, reduce
the size of the portions you’re giving him without cutting back on the number
of meals he’s getting. Another option is to decrease or eliminate any grain
he’s getting and to switch to grass hay or a grass-legume hay mix.
134
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Use this method to determine how much to cut back on your overweight
horse’s feeding:
1. Because the average 1,000-pound horse should get 18 to 20 pounds of
hay per day, begin by gradually switching from the same amount 
of legume hay that your horse is currently getting to grass hay or a
grass-legume hay mix; cut out any grains or concentrates that your
horse is getting.
See how your horse does on this amount.
2. If your horse continues to gain weight, cut him down to 15 pounds of
grass hay or a grass-legume hay mix a day; if he maintains his weight
but doesn’t lose, cut him down to 14 pounds a day.
Meanwhile, parcel this hay (whatever the amount) out into three to four feed-
ings per day. Some horses eat more quickly than they ideally should. Horses
in confinement — which is most horses these days — are especially bad
about eating too quickly.
Weight loss should be gradual. Do not cut your horse’s hay intake to less than
15 pounds per day (for a 1,000-pound horse). Horses fed minimal forage diets
are likely under a significant amount of stress, predisposing them to develop-
ing gastrointestinal ulcers, colic, laminitis, and other diseases.
If your horse still doesn’t lose weight after this feed change/reduction, 
contact your veterinarian.
Underweight horses
When it comes to weight issues, horses usually have more problems with
being overweight rather than underweight. That said, some horses are
known for being “hard keepers,” meaning that it’s tough for their owners 
to keep these horses at a high-enough weight.
If you have a horse who can’t keep weight on, your first step is to have him
checked out by a veterinarian. The vet should check the horse’s teeth and
talk to you about your deworming program (see Chapter 4 for general infor-
mation about tooth care and deworming). He or she may then make some
suggestions as to how you can boost the horse’s calorie intake. This boost
may involve giving the horse more of the same food, adding new foods, or
changing the type of food altogether.
135
Chapter 8: Special Considerations for Your Horse’s Diet

In some cases, horses can be hard to keep at a good weight because of
genetic factors. Their metabolisms are such that they burn through calories
at a higher rate than other horses and simply need more food to eat.
If deworming the horse, caring for his teeth, and increasing his feed don’t
solve the problem, the vet should follow up with a fecal exam and blood 
work to see whether a health problem is causing the weight loss.
Controlling Allergies with Diet
Horses get allergies just like humans do. Sometimes their allergies are air-
borne. Other times the allergies come from diet. Whether your horse’s aller-
gies are from what she’s breathing, touching, or eating, a change in diet may
help. (For more details on allergies, see Chapter 11.)
Recognizing signs of allergies
Horses show signs that they’re allergic to something in different ways. These
include:
 Coughing: When an allergen irritates a horse’s airways, she coughs. This
coughing may be intermittent or constant, depending on the severity of
the allergy.
 Loud breathing: Horses can develop something called chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, or COPD (sometimes called “heaves”; see
Chapter 11 for more information). Although COPD may not be caused
specifically by allergens, it can be aggravated by them. Horses who have
COPD breathe loudly, almost like they’re wheezing. The loud breathing
increases with exercise.
 Hives: Small itchy bumps that appear in a certain spot on a horse’s
body, or all over it, are hives. Hives can erupt when a horse comes into
contact with something that she’s allergic to, such as certain types of
bedding or an insect bite. Breathing in allergens or eating something
that she’s allergic to can also trigger hives in horses.
 Digestive upset: Horses with allergies to food can get sick when they eat
something that causes their immune system to overreact. One symptom
of this may be diarrhea or loose stool.
If your horse shows any of these symptoms, allergies may be involved. Other
life-threatening or contagious diseases may be involved, however, so a veteri-
nary exam is recommended.
136
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Checking out options for allergic horses
Horses who have allergies can benefit from changes in their diet. Depending
on what your horse is allergic to, certain feeds can make a difference.
 Many horses who have allergies that affect their airways can benefit
from eating feed that’s low in dust. If your horse coughs a lot and your
vet believes that she suffers from allergies, consider soaking her hay 
in a tub of water (enough to cover the hay) before you feed her (see 
Figure 8-4). Feeding the horse with a ground-level container is another
good choice. Both methods reduce the amount of dust that wafts up her
nose while she’s eating.
Horses with allergic respiratory symptoms sometimes are forced to eat
hay cubes or other types of complete feeds that are dust free. However,
because horses need the roughage that comes with hay, we recom-
mended feeding at least some hay, and soaking it first. Discuss this pos-
sibility with your vet.
 If your horse gets hives and your vet believes that the condition is being
caused by food that she’s eating, or if your horse gets digestive upset as
a result of a food allergy, you need to find something for her to eat that
doesn’t trigger her immune system to overreact. Trial and error is often
the best way to determine what food is most suitable for your allergic
horse. Gradually switch your horse’s hay or pasture to a different plant
type and watch for an improvement in symptoms. For example, if your
horse seems to be allergic to Bermuda, gradually switch her over to timo-
thy to see whether that helps. If that doesn’t do the trick, try another hay,
such as orchard, or possibly alfalfa. Although food trials like this can be
frustrating, if you persist, you may eventually find the right diet for your
allergic horse. Your vet can help guide you through this process.

Chapter 8: Special Considerations for Your Horse’s Diet

Affecting Your Horse’s 
Behavior with Diet
You may have heard that children who eat a lot of sugary foods can become
hyper. This is a classic case of how diet can affect behavior, and it applies to
horses as well. Keeping horses calm requires a balance of food, exercise, and
training. Overwork and/or stall confinement can actually make a horse seem
more hyper when the actual problem is that the horse is nervous or stressed
because he never gets any downtime.
That said, certain types of foods can cause horses to build up more energy
than they can easily burn. The result is behavior that the average horse
owner doesn’t appreciate. The good news is that for many of these horses, 
a change in diet can literally change their personalities. (For the basics of
handling misbehaving horses, flip to Chapter 3.)
Food-related misbehaviors
Most of the diet-related bad behavior seen in horses has to do with an excess
of energy. Give a horse food that gives him gobs of energy and not enough
exercise, and you have a recipe for disaster. Some horses are so affected by
their diets that even hours of exercise every day won’t calm them down.
Here are a few bad behaviors that can be food related:
 Spookiness: Ever ridden a horse who feels like he’s going to explode 
out from underneath you? Who jumps at every sound and can’t be 
consoled no matter how much you talk to him or try to distract him?
Although many horses are just built to be spooky due to genetics or
training, others may behave like this because they’re getting too many
carbohydrates.
 Difficulty under saddle: Some horses don’t respond to training when
being ridden. They can’t seem to focus on the rider and want to do
things like buck, run off, rear, or generally misbehave. Although most 
of the time this is due to poor training or riding, in some cases, it’s the
result of a diet that’s way too high in carbohydrates.
 Bad barn behavior: If you’ve ever walked by a horse’s stall in a barn
aisle and had him come lunging at you, teeth bared, you know how
unpleasant a cranky horse can be. Most horses who act this way are
unhappy about something in their lives, or just don’t like people, for
whatever reason. Others are getting too many carbs and are crawling
out of their skin with excess energy.
138
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Not all horses react so violently to too many carbs in their diet, but enough
do to make diet change one of the first recommendations vets and well-
educated trainers suggest when clients express frustration with a horse’s
behavior.
Figuring out whether diet is the cause of bad behavior can be tricky. Discuss
this possibility with your veterinarian before you look for other causes.
Changing your “hot” horse’s diet
Take a close look at horses who are misbehaving for reasons related to diet,
and you’ll see that they’re probably kept in stalls and are getting a legume
hay (alfalfa in particular can make some horses high). Or, they may have a
diet that includes grains, which are loaded with carbs. Another common
ingredient in high-horse diets is sweet feed, a grain or hay mix or commercial
feed containing molasses. The excess carbohydrates in each of these types of
feed convert to sugar in the horse’s body, which becomes unhealthy energy
with nowhere to go.
Take these high-carb foods away from a “hot” horse and you just may see a
change in personality. If you suspect that your horse may be one of these
carb victims, cut out the grain and the sweet feed, and switch to a grass hay
from a legume hay. Give your horse a month on his new diet to see whether it
helps. If it doesn’t, you may have a training or genetic issue. Get help from a
professional trainer. (For details on how to find a good trainer, see Horses For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by coauthor Audrey with Janice Posnikoff,
DVM, and published by Wiley.)

I
f you’re fortunate enough to have a lot of land at your disposal and are
also a stickler about your horse’s health and nutrition, this is the chapter
for you! Growing food for your horses is a rewarding pastime, and your equine
buddies will be happier and healthier for the experience. You’ll save yourself
a bundle of money on feed, too.
In this chapter, we tell you how to grow your own pasture and how to maintain
it. We also educate you on the ways of turning that pasture into hay that you
can store away for winter months. When you’re done reading this chapter,
you’ll have a good idea of what’s involved in being a self-sufficient horse owner.
Before You Begin: The Basics 
of Growing Food for Horses
Horses love pasture. It’s not only good for them nutritionally, but it also satisfies
their ever-burning need to graze. Wild horses are constantly browsing for food
in their environment, and domestic horses who are robbed of this activity can
suffer both physically and emotionally from this loss.
Of course, to grow good pasture (or good hay, for that matter), you have to
know what you’re doing. Your horse’s very life depends on it. Fortunately, it’s
not that hard, and after you figure out how to do it, you’ll find that it becomes
an enjoyable part of your regular routine. In the following sections, we cover
some basics for you to consider before you take the plunge and start growing
food for your horse.

The benefits of growing food
The best thing about pasture is that it gives the horse a chance to do what
comes naturally to him: graze! Because a pasture is the most natural environ-
ment for your horse, it’s what he would prefer. So if you have a choice, let your
horse graze on pasture instead of cutting it, or make it into hay, at least for
part of the year. If you live in a cold climate where pastures just don’t grow in
the wintertime due to a deep freeze (and most people in the U.S. do), you’ll
have to feed your horse hay anyway for a part of the year. You can either grow
that hay yourself or buy it from another source.
Additional benefits of growing pasture include the following:
 Growing pasture saves you money on hay. If you decide to cut your
pasture and turn it into hay, you need the right equipment and man-
power to get the job done. See the later section “Harvesting Hay for the
Future” to find out exactly what this process entails.
 Growing pasture is less work. You don’t have to feed your horses every
morning if they’re on fully sustainable pasture — they feed themselves.
 Pasture saves you money on vet bills in the long run. Pasture-kept
horses have fewer problems with colic and lameness. You may even
save time and money on training too. Horses who live in pastures have
fewer behavioral problems than stall-kept horses.
A hard look at the responsibilities 
of growing food
Before you run out and plant a pasture, it’s important to realize that taking on
this venture requires considerable care and maintenance. You can’t just turn
your horse loose in a field full of plants and think that you have your horse
on pasture. You have to make sure that the right plants are growing in the
field, and you have to fertilize and irrigate the field, rotate the pasture, clean
the pasture, and keep a close eye on it to make sure that it’s producing the
right type of nutrition for your horse. (Don’t worry; we explain how to do all
these tasks later in this chapter.)
Turning pasture into hay for your horse requires additional work. You need
to cut, bale, and store the hay, which means you need the equipment to do
these tasks or you must hire someone to do them for you. See “Harvesting
Hay for the Future” in this chapter for more information on growing hay.
If you aren’t willing or able to commit to this kind of workload, reconsider
your ideas about keeping your horse on pasture. You can always go back to it
later when the time is right.
142
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Starting and Maintaining a Pasture
In order to grow a pasture and keep it in good shape, you have to maintain it.
This maintenance takes work, so be prepared. After you take in all the informa-
tion in the following sections, think long and hard about whether you want to get
involved in this endeavor. It’s rewarding, but it does require real commitment.
A new pasture can take a couple of years to mature enough to accommodate
grazing horses, so be patient.
The stuff you need before you do anything
In order to successfully keep horses on pasture, you need some basic things.
These basics include:
 Land: You can grow pasture on as much as 40 acres of land or as little as 40
square feet of land — and everything in between (see the nearby sidebar
“Hope for the pasture challenged”). But you do need soil that’s workable
in order to pull it off. Ask your county extension agent to evaluate your
soil for workability.
 Fencing: You need good fencing materials and secure gates if you hope
to keep your horse safely in a pasture. You can use any type of fencing
that’s suitable for horses (pipe, no-climb woven wire, wood, PVC). Get
the best fence that you can afford. Never use barbed wire for horses —
they can easily become tangled in it and seriously injured.
143
Chapter 9: Growing Your Own Food
Hope for the pasture challenged
Many people don’t have room on their property
for a proper pasture. You may be working with
an acre or less of land, and just don’t have room
for one or two pastures to sustain your horse. If
this is the case, don’t despair. You can still give
your horse the opportunity to indulge his natural
instincts to graze. Simply create a small area
that your horse can use as “pasture,” even for
just an hour or two daily.
When coauthor Dr. Kate lived in Las Vegas —
which isn’t an area that’s known for acres of
lush green pastures — she planted a 60 x 60
foot square area of Bermuda grass and watered
it with a simple garden hose sprinkler. She let
each of her five horses have about an hour daily
in that area. When the pasture began to look
overgrazed, she cut back on the time the horses
spent there.
Because it was a small area, Dr. Kate rented an
aerator once a year to keep the soil from becom-
ing compacted and to make sure that it remained
productive. She also kept the area fertilized and
watered for optimum productivity. Even though it
was only a small area, Dr. Kate’s horses really
looked forward to their grazing time.

After your fencing is installed, you need to walk it frequently to look for
holes, sagging, or any damage or problems that could be hazardous to
your horse.
 Irrigation: Unless you live in a tropical rainforest, you have to water
your pasture on a regular basis. Plan this out ahead of time. (See the section
“Irrigating” later in this chapter for details.)
Make sure that you plan for all these necessities before you establish your
pasture. You want to be prepared before the pasture starts growing.
Deciding what to plant
The types of forage you’re able to grow depend on your geographic location,
how much average rainfall you get, and which grasses are most resistant to
local insect pests. (If you have an irrigation system, rainfall will be less of an
issue for you when you’re determining what to plant.)
Grow a combination of forages in your pastures so that your horse has a vari-
ety. Each species of grass will grow and be most productive at different times
during the season. And if you add legumes to your pasture, in addition to
grass, you fix nitrogen into the soil too.
To discover the best pasture grasses to grow in your particular area, consult
with your USDA Cooperative Extension System agent. (See the appendix for
the address of the USDA Cooperative Extension System office’s Web site.)
This individual can give you great advice about what grows well where you
live, as well as what kind of treatment you need to give your soil for optimum
pasture nutrition.
144
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 
Letting your horse mow your lawn
Although it may be tempting to toss grass clip-
pings to your horse after you mow your lawn,
resist the urge! The size of grass clippings is too
short for your horse to chew. The result is that
the clippings can easily wad up into a ball in the
esophagus and cause the horse to choke.
Instead, let your horse mow the lawn for you
with his teeth. Horse-proof your lawn first by
looking for anything your horse could cut or
scrape himself on, and make certain that you fer-
tilize only with organic fertilizer. Don’t use insec-
ticides on your lawn, either. You may need to
replace your sprinkler heads with industrial
strength versions, but your horse will love you for
the opportunity to help with gardening chores.

Preparing the ground
Before you can plant your pasture, you need to prepare the soil. Unless you
have all the equipment on hand to do this, you may want to hire someone to
do it for you (such as a neighbor who works his own pasture or a pasture
maintenance service). Here are the general steps to follow:
1. Till the soil with a plow or rotary tiller, and then work it with a
mulcher.
Tilling aerates the soil and removes clumps of dirt.
2. Level the field with a harrow.
The soil should be fine and without large clods or chunks of dirt before
you plant the seed.
3. Have your local county extension office test the soil.
You want to make sure that the pH level is just right for the plants you
intend to grow before you put down that precious seed.
Seeding
Seeding a pasture isn’t as easy as seeding a flower garden. You can’t just toss
the seeds out and hope for the best. (Actually, you could, but this technique
would be wasteful.) Consider hiring an expert with the right equipment for this
task if you’re growing a pasture for the first time. Such folks include neighbors
who are experienced with growing pasture or a pasture maintenance service.
Have an expert with the right equipment drill the seeds into the soil as they’re
planted. The best depth is from 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch, although the ideal depth can vary
from grass to grass. Get help from your county extension agent.
You may also want to consider planting a nurse crop, such as oats. A nurse
crop helps the seedlings sprout by anchoring the soil and protecting them
from the sun. (You plant the nurse crop seeds alongside the hay seeds.) You
can harvest the nurse crop the next season, leaving the young hay exposed
to light when it’s ready.
The best time of year to seed your pasture is in the fall — the moisture in the
winter and spring will help it grow.
145
Chapter 9: Growing Your Own Food

Irrigating
Your pasture needs water in order to grow and survive. If you’re lucky
enough to live in a climate with a lot of rain, nature does much of the work
for you. If you live in a dry climate, your pasture grass depends on you to
keep it alive. How you choose to provide water depends on how big your pas-
ture is, as well as your resources, time restraints, and personal preferences.
Use the information in the following sections to help you irrigate your pas-
ture in the best way possible.
Sticking to a few basic irrigation rules
Irrigating takes a bit of knowledge, but after you know the basic rules, you
can water your pastures with success. Here are some rules to follow:
 Don’t graze horses on freshly irrigated pasture because it damages the
grass.
 Learn the water needs of your grasses, and don’t over- or under-water.
 Test the quality of your water to ensure that it doesn’t contain too much
salt or too many minerals. Too much salt or minerals can store up in the
soil and affect its fertility. Your local county extension agent can test
your water for you.
 Irrigate early in the morning when wind and sun are low.
Getting water
If you have a tiny pasture, irrigation isn’t too difficult. You can water your
pasture the way you water your lawn: with sprinklers. But if you have a
bigger pasture, you need a more sophisticated method.
Here are some methods of pasture irrigation. Choose the method of irrigation
best suited to your pasture needs:
 Sprinklers: One way to water a large pasture is with multiple sprinklers
hooked up to a traveling system. The system operates unattended and
shuts off automatically when it’s finished.
 Flooding: This method allows you to open a valve and flood the surface
of your pasture with water. This calls for more labor than a sprinkler
system because you have to monitor the water flow and shut it off before
it reaches the end of the field. Also, if your land has slope, undulates, or
is very sandy, this type of irrigation won’t work very well.
 Water reels: Water reels are a popular choice for a lot of pastures, espe-
cially larger ones. The water reel moves through the pasture on its own,
and can negotiate difficult terrain and work around trees and other objects.
146
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Before you invest in an irrigation system, make sure that you have a reliable
water source. You need from 5 to 20 gpm (gallons per minute) from a well or
stream to effectively water a pasture.
Knowing how often to irrigate
Too much or too little water can stress your plants. Grazing plus stress from
poor irrigation can leave you with sorry pastures.
The actual amount of water to give your pasture varies depending on where
you’re located. Information on pasture water use, also called evapotranspira-
tion, is available at your local USDA Cooperative Extension System office.
(See the appendix for full contact information.) This info can help you deter-
mine how often you should water.
The frequency of irrigation also depends on the kind of grass that you’re
growing. Find out how much water your crop needs by discussing it with your
county extension office. Then, purchase soil moisture sensors to keep track of
how wet your soil is, and to help you figure out when you need to water.
You can also figure how much to water based on the idea that many pastures
should receive an inch of water every five days. If natural rainfall doesn’t
provide this much water, you need to provide it with irrigation.
The type of soil you have determines how much you should water, too. Loam
types of soil hold more water than sandy soil, so they don’t require as much
irrigation.
Cleaning
Just because your horse is out to pasture doesn’t mean that you don’t have
to pick up the poop! Keep your pastures clear of manure by breaking up piles
or picking up manure at least once a week. Reasons for doing this include:
 Horses won’t eat where they poop. Who can blame them?
 Internal parasites re-infect your horse if he’s forced to graze near manure.
 Flies multiply if you leave manure lying about the field.
Either use a piece of equipment known as a drag to disperse manure piles
(thereby breaking up parasite incubators) or use one of the newer vacuuming
devices designed to pick up manure in pastures. You can find these devices
at farming supply stores.
147
Chapter 9: Growing Your Own Food

Fertilizing
If you want to keep your pasture grass nutritious, you need to fertilize it. Grazing
depletes the grass of nutrients, and fertilizing pasture spares you the expense
of having to reclaim soil that’s been destroyed by improper care.
To know what kind of fertilizer to use for your particular crop in your area of
the country, take soil samples. Your county extension agent can help you with
this task and can also tell you how frequently to fertilize the type of pasture
you’ve chosen. Keep in mind that if you want your pasture to be organic, you
have to use only organic fertilizers.
Aerating
Horses walk while they graze, which is great for their legs. Unfortunately, it’s
not great for the pasture. All this walking compacts the soil and makes it
more difficult for grass to grow and for soil to absorb water.
To combat this, you need to aerate your pasture on a regular basis. The fre-
quency depends on your soil type, the amount of rainfall you get, and the
number of horses you keep on the pasture. A county extension agent can
help you determine the frequency rate. You can aerate the pasture yourself
by investing in an aerator (the type you push for small jobs, or the kind you
pull with a tractor) or by hiring someone who provides this service.
To help reduce the need for frequent aeration, don’t graze your horses during
or right after a rainfall. Give the pasture a chance to dry out. Grazing on wet
ground increases the soil compaction rate.
Managing your pasture
In order to have continued good forage and healthy horses who get the nutrition
they need, you need to manage your pasture. Maintaining a pasture is much
cheaper than reclaiming one and starting from scratch. Here are some tips on
how to best maintain your horse’s pasture:
 Take soil samples. Taking soil samples of your pasture either in the spring
or fall of each year is a wise maneuver. Have the sample analyzed by your
local USDA Cooperative Extension System office so that you know the
general health of your soil, and whether you need to add anything to it.
148
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

 Practice rotational grazing. Whenever possible, divide your pasture
into at least two areas so that your horse can graze on one part while
the other part “rests” for at least one season, depending on the type of
grass you’re growing. Resting enables your pasture to recover from
repeated grazing.
 Use weed control. Practice weed control to keep your pastures healthy.
Coauthor Dr. Kate doesn’t use herbicides at all, but she controls weeds
by mowing intensively before the weedy plants bud and go to seed.
Eventually, the good grasses take over and crowd out the weeds. Yes, it’s
more labor-intensive, but it’s better for the environment in the long run.
Harvesting Hay for the Future
Some people not only graze their horses on pasture, but also like to grow
their own hay. Growing hay is a lot of work, but it’s rewarding. You save money
on feed, and you have the satisfaction of knowing exactly what your horses
are eating. You can even grow your hay organically to be sure that your horses
aren’t ingesting any herbicides or pesticides.
Before you can start harvesting your own hay, you need to find out about
cutting, baling, curing, and storing hay.
Cutting hay in your pasture
The second cut of hay from a pasture during its second year of growth is usually
the best stuff to feed to your horse. Generally, during the first season, the hay isn’t
mature enough. And the first cutting usually isn’t high enough in quality to feed
your horse. (It’s fine for cows, though, if you or your neighbors have any of those.)
The time of the season when you cut your hay is very important, as is the
weather. (When you cut your hay depends on the crop you’re growing; your
county extension agent can advise you on the right time.) Too much rain can
result in wet, moldy hay, and weather that’s too dry can leave you with dried-
out hay. Watch the weather and cut when the air is dry but not too hot.
Plant maturity is another issue tied in with the time of season to cut. Less
mature plants have more leaves than they do stems, so they’re more nutritious.
On the other hand, they don’t give as much yield as more mature plants. Again,
your county extension agent can help you learn the nuances of hay maturity
and nutrition, depending on the type of hay that you’re growing and where
you live.
149
Chapter 9: Growing Your Own Food

After the hay is cut, usually with a sickle-bar mower, it’s left in piles called
windrows. The hay sits and dries out in these windrows until it’s ready for
baling (see the next section). The amount of time it takes the hay to dry out
depends on the level of humidity in the air at the time of the cutting. To help
the hay dry, you can turn over the windrows a few times. (If you’re inexperi-
enced in cutting hay, have an experienced neighbor help you or hire a service
to do the work.)
Baling and curing hay
When the hay in the windrows is dry, the baling process begins. In some parts
of the country, you need to get up very early to get the job done. The morning
dew helps keep the stems and leaves together during the baling process. In
other regions, the hay has too much moisture in the morning and needs some
time in the sun to dry properly for baling conditions.
Waiting until later in the day when it’s hot leaves you with bales that aren’t
very good. In fact, they can be dangerous because harmful bacteria can grow
inside them.
A hay baler, which is pulled by a tractor, determines the size of the bales.
Most hay for horses is baled with a hay baler that yields bales weighing
about 40 to 60 pounds. The hay baler compresses the hay into a bale, and
then ties it together with baling twine. (You need someone with this equip-
ment and experience baling to help you with this work. Hay baling services
are available for hire.)
After you bale the hay, you may leave it out in the field to continue curing.
This allows more of the moisture in the bales to evaporate before you move
them indoors. This curing process can take anywhere from one day to three
or more, depending on the weather and humidity levels.
Hay that’s damp and kept inside is susceptible to mold, which can be danger-
ous to your horse’s health. It can also cause the hay to start to ferment,
which can lead to combustion, allowing the hay to catch on fire all by itself.
150
Part II: Good Eats: Nutrition and Feeding 

Storing hay
After your hay is baled and cured, you should store it indoors away from rain
or snow. A three-sided building often is best for storage because it allows the
hay to ventilate while still protecting it from getting wet and moldy.
If your only option is to store your hay outdoors in an uncovered area, be
sure to cover it with a tarp to prevent it from getting wet. Check your tarp
regularly too, to make sure that it doesn’t contain any holes. If your hay gets
wet, remove the tarp immediately and let the hay dry out as soon as you can
by opening the bales and spreading the hay around. Leaving wet hay under a
tarp encourages mold to grow.
When storing your hay on the ground, use wooden pallets underneath it to
keep the hay from touching the ground, where moisture can get to it. Another
option is to keep your hay in a barn loft so that you don’t have to worry
about the bales making contact with the ground.

 Exploring the horse’s body systems
 Discovering outer parts of the horse
Your horse is of course a beautiful creature on the outside, but did you
know how awesome she is on the inside too? The horse has an amazing
anatomy, designed to function in perfect harmony with her environment.
Knowing some of the details of how your horse’s body works can help you take
good care of your equine companion. It gives you a sense of what’s happening
when things are going right — and when things are going wrong.
In this chapter, we give you a tour of your horse’s body. You discover all the
important systems and how they work. You also explore the major organs,
and other important stuff like teeth, ears, and hooves.
The Workings of Your Horse’s Innards
Your horse’s body is made up of a number of systems, each responsible for a
different function. Put all these systems together and you have an incredible
living creature known as the horse.
For your horse to stay healthy, it’s vital that each of these systems functions
properly and in conjunction with each other. In the following sections, we
take a look at what goes on inside your horse’s body and makes her tick. You
can check out the details of these systems in the color section.

Start your engine: The 
cardiovascular system
The cardiovascular system — also known as the circulatory system — is one
of the most important systems in your horse’s body. This system is responsible
for moving blood from one part of the body to another. It’s essentially the
engine that runs your horse’s body, and it’s the foundation for all other systems.
The cardiovascular system is responsible for moving nutrients, wastes, and
gases to and from cells throughout the body. It’s also responsible for stabilizing
body temperature and body pH. It involves three different elements: the heart,
the systemic circulation, and the pulmonary system. Arteries and veins are
part of both systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation, and blood itself
runs through everything.
Fortunately, cardiovascular ailments are rare in horses.
The heart
The equine heart is more than just a place where your horse’s love for you
resides. It’s a four-chamber muscle weighing about 10 pounds that pumps blood
throughout the blood vessels in her body. The equine heart is particularly
powerful, as you might imagine, because it has the task of circulating blood
through the horse’s rather large mass.
The famous racehorse Secretariat was found after his death to have an
abnormally large heart even for a horse (along with very large lungs). This is
believed to be the reason he was able to run with such incredible speed.
The equine heart is very much like the human heart. It has left and right
chambers, left and right ventricles, and a series of valves, veins, and arteries.
The difference is that the horse’s heart can pump about 40 quarts of blood
per minute. That’s a lot more than the human heart, which pumps only about
4 quarts in that same amount of time.
Pulmonary circulation
The reason for the circulation of blood in the horse’s body is to spread oxygen
to various parts. That oxygen comes from the air your horse breathes, and
gets into the horse’s blood through the lungs, or pulmonary system. Pulmonary
circulation is the part within the cardiovascular system that sends blood to
the lungs so that it can be enriched with oxygen before it goes to the rest of the
body.
It works like this: Blood without oxygen (which is deep red in color, by the way)
enters the right atrium of the heart and then moves into the right ventricle.
156
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

From there, it’s pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where
it picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood is then pumped out of the heart
and into the rest of the horse’s body.
Systemic circulation
While the heart works as a pump to move blood around your horse’s body,
the systemic circulation aspect of the cardiovascular system works to carry
oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body, and then back to the
heart after the oxygen has been removed. A system of arteries, veins, and
blood vessels moves blood throughout the body.
Essentially, the systemic circulation keeps the blood flowing, spreading much-
needed oxygen to cells in different parts of your horse’s body.
Arteries and veins
In order for oxygenated blood to be carried away from the heart, it needs a
passageway. This comes in the form of arteries, which are flexible tubes. Some
arteries are large, while others are smaller. They can be found in various areas
of the horse’s body (as you can see in the color section in the center of this
book).
Veins are made up of blood vessels that carry blood with very little oxygen
toward the horse’s heart. From there, the blood is sent through special
pulmonary arteries, where it gathers oxygen before returning to the rest of
the body through the arteries.
Blood
You know what blood is, but do you know what it’s made of? Whether you’re
talking about horse blood or human blood, the essence is the same. Both are
made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These elements are
contained in a protein-rich fluid called blood plasma. Here’s more info on each:
 Red blood cells provide transportation of oxygen to different parts of
the body, via the arteries.
 White blood cells help stave off infection from invading organisms.
 Platelets govern the consistency of the blood.
 Plasma serves to hold all the other components of blood together and
provides immunoglobulins and clotting factors. If you were to separate
the elements of blood in a test tube, a majority of what you’d see would
be plasma.

Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

Eat up! The digestive system
A very important system in the equine body is the digestive system. Horses
are virtual eating machines, designed to consume food for nearly 18 hours a
day. So, as you can imagine, their digestive systems are designed to work
overtime.
The horse’s digestive system consists of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus,
stomach, pancreas, intestines, liver, rectum, and anus. Each of these body
parts serves a distinct function in helping your horse’s body obtain nutrients
from her food.
When a horse’s digestive system stops functioning properly due to illnesses or
a particular condition, colic is often the first symptom. In Chapter 11, you find
details on a variety of problems that affect the function of the equine digestive
system.
The mouth
The process of digestion begins with your horse’s mouth. The mouth not only
provides entry to the digestive system, but also begins the digestive process.
When your horse chews her food, her teeth crush it into tiny particles. The
food mixes with saliva and becomes moist, and then slips down into the
esophagus through the pharynx.
The pharynx
Shaped like a funnel, the pharynx is a six-inch muscular sac in the area where
the trachea (the tube that leads to the lungs) and the esophagus (the tube
that leads to the stomach) meet. When your horse eats, her food passes
quickly through the pharynx. After the food gets past this point, it can’t go
back into the mouth.
The esophagus
Next in the process is the esophagus, a tubular muscle that’s nearly five feet
long. It begins in the pharynx and feeds into the stomach. A wave-like
process called peristalsis moves food that has been moistened with saliva
down through the esophagus and into the stomach.
In the horse, the esophagus is a one-way street. The peristalsis can go only
from the top down to the stomach. This is one reason why horses can’t vomit.
The stomach
The next destination for the swallowed food is your horse’s stomach, which
is shaped like a J and pretty small, considering how big the horse is. (It can hold
only from 5 to 15 liters at a time.) The entrance to the stomach is governed by
158
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

the cardiac sphincter, a muscle that opens to allow food to come in, but it
doesn’t allow food to come out.
After the food reaches the horse’s stomach, it’s enveloped by digestive juices,
which begin the process of breaking it down. The stomach then sends the
food on to the intestines, where the majority of the nutrients are absorbed.
The pancreas
Some of the digestive juices that the stomach uses to begin to break down the
cellulose material that your horse ingests come from the pancreas. Called pan-
creatic juices, these substances consist of enzymes that are alkaline in nature.
The pancreas also produces hormones, including insulin, which helps regulate
blood sugar.
The intestines
The intestines are the most impressive part of your horse’s digestive system.
Your horse has 70 (or more) feet of intestine inside her abdominal cavity. The
intestines absorb most of the nutrition from your horse’s food.
The intestinal tract consists of the small intestine and the large intestine:
 The stomach empties into the small intestine, which contains the duo-
denum and the jejunum. Both the duodenum and the jejunum have a
part in digestion; the duodenum breaks down food in the small intestine,
and the jejunum absorbs nutrients from the food.
 The small intestine is connected to the large intestine (also called the
colon) via the ileum. Microbes in the large intestine are responsible for
breaking down the plant fiber ingested by the horse. Many of these 
critters are in part of the intestines called the cecum. The cecum joins
the ileum on one side and the large intestine on the other.
Without the amazing cecum, the horse wouldn’t be able to digest its
food. The comma-shaped bit of intestine can hold as much as 30 liters of
fluid, and is considered part of the large intestine.
The liver
Your horse’s liver is part of her digestive system; it converts amino acids into
fat and glucose or glycogen, metabolizes ammonia, and keeps the horse healthy
by purifying her blood like a filter. It serves several other functions: It stores
glycogen, which is important in energy, and it synthesizes proteins found in
blood plasma.
159
Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

The rectum and the anus
After your horse has finished digesting her food, waste moves to the rectum,
which is about one foot in length. From there, it goes to the anus, where it’s
projected out of the horse’s body. That’s when you come in, manure fork in
hand, and clean it up.
Raging hormones: The endocrine system
If you’ve ever wondered where your hormones come from, wonder no more.
The endocrine system — a series of small organs — produces the hormones
in your body. Oh, and in your horse’s body too.
The organs that make up the endocrine system are the hypothalamus, the
pineal gland, the thyroid, the parathyroid, the thymus, the pituitary gland,
the adrenal gland, the pancreas, and the ovaries or testes, depending on the
gender of your horse. Each of these organs produces a different type of hor-
mone. Hormones regulate all kinds of stuff in your horse’s body, including
adrenaline, thyroid, insulin, estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone, to
name just a few.
As you probably know, hormones affect not only the way your body functions,
but also your moods. This is true of your horse too. For example:
 Adrenaline kicks in when your horse spooks at something.
 If you have a mare, varying levels of estrogen and progesterone cause
her to develop the equine version of PMS when she goes into season.
 If you have a stallion, you’ve no doubt seen his assertive attitude toward
mares and sometimes life in general; this attitude is the result of 
testosterone.
Fighting off germs: The immune system
The immune system is a complicated series of protein types, organs, cells,
and tissue, all interacting in a complex and elaborate way. The function of
your horse’s immune system is to protect her from viruses, bacteria, parasites,
and any other foreign organism or material that may compromise her health.
Of all the elements that make up the immune system, white blood cells, also
known as leukocytes, serve as one of the body’s defensive linemen. When an
outside invader enters the body, white blood cells attack the offending party
and render it helpless.
160
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

The lymphatic system is another important part of your horse’s immune system.
A network of lymph nodes in your horse’s body produces phagocytes, Pac Man-
like cells that may remove bacteria and cancerous cells in the bloodstream.
When a horse’s immune system becomes weakened, she becomes more
susceptible to illness. The bone marrow doesn’t produce enough white blood
cells to combat invading organisms, and the lymph nodes don’t produce enough
phagocytes. The result is that the horse easily becomes infected by viruses or
bacteria that exist in the environment. (Check out Chapter 12 for an introduction
of common infectious diseases that may affect your horse.)
Sometimes the immune system becomes hyperactive, overreacting to foreign
bodies and causing a problem as a result. Allergies are a good example of this
problem. Horses who suffer from allergic reactions are victims of a hyperactive
immune system that’s overreacting to the pollen, dust, or other allergens in the
horse’s environment. (For more information on allergies, see Chapter 11.)
Strong stuff: The muscular system
Your horse is a pretty muscular beast, as you have no doubt noticed. In fact,
her muscular system is one of the most incredible things about her. It’s what
gives her the ability to run like the wind, spin on a dime, and buck like a fiend.
More than 60 percent of your horse’s body is made up of skeletal muscle. These
muscles come in bundles, which are in turn made up of muscle fibers. 
These fibers contract to make the muscles move. Fascia, a fibrous tissue,
covers the muscles. Muscles attach to one another through the fascia, and
attach to bone through the tendons.
Tendons are important because they’re vulnerable to injury and can render a
horse lame if they’re damaged. This is most true of the tendons found in your
horse’s legs. These include the common digital extensor, the lateral digital
extensor, the deep digital flexor, and the superficial digital flexor. A tendon
sheath protects tendons that extend over joints, and contains synovial fluid,
which works as a lubricant.
Disorders of the muscles and tendons are one of the biggest issues for horses
because they’re athletes. Horses who are worked hard can damage muscles
and tendons. See Chapter 11 for more information on muscle and tendon
injuries.
161
Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

Feeling sensitive: The nervous system
The most complicated system in your horse’s body is easily the nervous
system. You could say that the nervous system is a big part of what makes
your horse who she is. So much of her personality and functionality are the
result of workings in her nervous system.
Your horse’s nervous system is made up of two subsystems: the central nervous
system and the peripheral nervous system.
 The central nervous system consists of your horse’s brain and spinal cord.
 The peripheral nervous system is made up of the cranial and spinal
nerves, nerve ganglia, and the autonomic nervous system.
The central nervous system is largely responsible for your horse’s behavior.
It also controls your horse’s senses, in conjunction with the peripheral ner-
vous system. What your horse sees, feels, tastes, and hears is all deciphered
by the central nervous system. The way she reacts to these stimuli is also a
function of her nervous system. (Check out Chapter 3 for details on the con-
nection between your horse’s health and behavior.)
If your horse is nervous, does that mean that she has more nerves in her
body than a naturally calm horse? No, but her nervous system may be more
sensitive than that of a quieter horse.
Breathe in, breathe out: 
The respiratory system
If you ride your horse in any kind of performance event — or even if you just
enjoy watching her gallop across the pasture — you can appreciate her glorious
respiratory system.
Horses have pretty much the same respiratory organs and processes that
humans have. The biggest difference is the size. Your horse’s nasal passages
are very long compared to yours. Her lungs are tremendous too, compared to
a human being’s lungs. This isn’t surprising, of course, because such a large
animal needs to be able to take in a lot of air.
When your horse breathes, she inhales air into her nasal passages with the
help of her diaphragm. The air passes through her trachea, into her lungs via
the bronchial tubes. Here, oxygen is taken from the air and transferred to the
blood (see the earlier section “Start your engine: The cardiovascular system”
for more information). The remaining carbon dioxide is exhaled back out
through the nostrils.
162
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Horses are susceptible to many of the same respiratory problems as humans,
including allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia.
For more information on respiratory problems, see Chapter 11.
Boning up on the skeletal system
The horse has a big skeleton, which serves several purposes. It provides a
frame for the body, protects the organs inside it, and supports soft tissue.
Your horse has around 205 individual bones in her body. These include the
following:
 Long bones, which help the horse move
 Short bones, which absorb concussion that’s the result of movement
 Flat bones, which enclose the organs
 Irregular bones, which encase the central nervous system (which we 
discuss earlier in this chapter)
Your horse’s skeleton is held together by tendons and ligaments. Tendons
attach muscle to bone, and ligaments attach bone to bone. The joints are
essentially the flexible parts of your horse’s skeleton, which allow the
individual bones to move independently of each other.
Cartilage is also part of your horse’s skeletal system, and is located at the
ends of your horse’s bones. Cartilage is nourished by synovial fluid (joint
fluid). Because it’s pliable, it’s often the first place to show wear and tear,
even in your horses.
Horses are prone to skeletal injuries, which can be very serious because of
the weight of the horse’s body. Broken legs are difficult to repair, and fractured
skulls are usually fatal. For details on conditions and injuries of the lower
skeleton, see Chapter 11.
Wasting away: The urinary system
Ever heard the expression “pee like a racehorse”? Well, part of that term
comes from the fact that racehorses are sometimes given diuretic drugs,
which make them urinate a lot. The other reason for this expression is that
horses have pretty big bladders!
163
Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

The horse’s urinary system is responsible for producing, storing, and elimi-
nating urine. Urine is the liquid waste that the kidneys produce. The kidneys
filter waste from the blood, as well as excrete and reabsorb water and elec-
trolytes to help keep the body’s blood electrolytes balanced. Horses have
two kidneys, just like humans do, although the equine kidneys are much
bigger. Each weighs almost 2 pounds.
The urine produced by the kidneys is mostly made up of water, and contains
only a small portion of solid waste. After production in the kidneys, urine moves
to the bladder and is excreted through the horse’s urethra.
You can tell a lot about a horse by her urine. Horses with abundant, clear or
light-colored urine are well-hydrated. Horses who have darker, shorter streams
of urine may not be drinking enough water. A horse’s urine may also change
depending on what she’s eating. And very copious, clear urine can signal a
kidney or endocrine problem.
The good news is that kidney disease and urinary issues in general are pretty
uncommon in horses. As long as your horse has plenty of fresh water to drink,
she’s unlikely to ever develop kidney or urinary troubles. Flip to Chapter 6
for more about the importance of water in a horse’s diet.
Important Parts on the Outside 
of Your Horse
Your horse’s internal organs and systems are pretty darn important, but what
about all the stuff that you can actually see on the outside? How important is
that? Well, very, of course. Without those external body parts, your horse
couldn’t function. Or at least not very well! In the following sections, we 
introduce you to some of the most important outside parts of your horse.
Figure 10-1 shows different parts on the outside of a horse’s body. The terms
in Figure 10-1 aren’t anatomical (like those in the following sections); they’re
simply meant to help horse people identify different areas of the equine form.
164
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

To serve and protect: The skin
The horse’s skin is more than just a covering for his body. It’s actually an
organ — and the largest organ in your horse’s body. Made up of different
layers called the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis, the skin holds hair follicles,
sweat glands, and sebaceous glands (see Figure 10-2).
The most important role that your horse’s skin plays is protecting him from
invasion by outside pathogens. The skin serves as a barrier, keeping your
horse’s vital organs from coming into contact with bacteria that could cause
serious damage.
Your horse’s skin also serves as insulation, keeping his internal organs from
becoming too cold or too hot, in response to outside temperatures. And
because his skin is sensitive to touch, it also protects him by keeping him
apprised of possible dangers in his environment.

Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

When your horse’s skin is damaged by trauma, it forms scar tissue as it heals.
During the healing process, before the wound resolves into a scar, granulation
tissue may be produced in significant quantities. Some areas of the horse’s
body are particularly prone to producing an excessive amount of granulation
tissue when a wound isn’t managed properly. Another common name for
excessive granulation tissue is proud flesh.
Your horse’s skin is susceptible to fungal and bacterial infections, as well as
injuries. See Chapter 11 for more information on these kinds of problems.
Looking at the eyes
The eyes are the windows to the soul. This is true not only of humans, but of
horses as well. The equine eye is very expressive, and horse owners who know
how to read their horse’s eyes become good at judging their horse’s moods.
Although the eyes are a good way to determine your horse’s state of mind,
they’re also highly functional external organs. The horse has a very large eye

that’s built very similarly to the human eye. The exterior of the eye has a cornea,
pupil, iris, and sclera, just like the human eye, as well as upper and lower eyelids.
Further in, the eye contains a lens, retina, optic disc, and optic nerve. Horses
also have a third eyelid, which helps protect the eye from trauma. Figure 10-3

Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

Your horse is equipped with better night vision than you are. He also has a
very wide range of vision on either side of his head. On the other hand, he
can’t see well directly in front of his nose or directly behind him.
Unfortunately, several ugly conditions and diseases can affect equine eyes.
Keeping a close eye on your horse’s eyes is important because such problems
must be treated immediately. See Chapter 11 for more details.
Listen up: The ears
The equine ear does more than just allow the horse to hear. It also provides a
great way to judge how a horse is feeling at any given moment. Horses use
their ears as tools of expression, and to send messages to other horses. (See
Chapter 3 for an illustration of equine expressions, and take note of the ears.)
Besides mood gauges, your horse’s ears are also functional — they detect
sound. Because horses evolved as prey animals, they’re astute at picking up
noises that could possibly be a predator lurking in the bushes, or approaching
in the distance. Watch a horse’s ears swivel around to take in various sounds
and you get a good sense of how these sound receivers really work.
The inside of your horse’s ears are similar to yours (see Figure 10-4). They
contain pinna, an ear canal, an ear drum, cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular
canals. All these parts work together to collect sound from the environment
and pass it along to the horse’s brain for filtering. They also provide a source
of balance and body position for the horse.
Horses are prone to a few different ear problems. Ear ticks can get into the
horse’s ear canals and cause head rubbing and much discomfort. Gnats can
also bite the insides of the horse’s ears and make them sore. In cold climates,
the tips of a horse’s ears can be lost due to frostbite.
If you suspect any problems with your horse’s ears (he tilts his head, shakes
it a lot, or rubs his ears on objects), contact your vet immediately.
168
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Taking a bite out of the teeth
You have no doubt noticed that your horse has a lot of teeth. Anywhere from 36
to 44, to be exact. They break down like this (see Figure 10-5 for the top and side
views):
 Twelve of those are incisors, used for grasping and tearing food.
 Twenty-four of your horse’s teeth are cheek teeth; they grind the food
down into fine particles before he swallows it.
 Horses (usually only males) also may have four canine teeth, which are
located between the incisors and the molars.
 Some horses have two wolf teeth, which are found just in front of the
upper molars. Occasionally, horses have four wolf teeth, two upper and
two lower.

Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse

Your horse’s teeth grow continuously, and will do so throughout most of his
life. This constant growth keeps the teeth from being worn down into useless
nubs from all that grinding of tough plant material. However, in horses who
are kept in domesticity, the fact that the horse’s upper jaw is wider than his
lower jaw creates a problem. The upper-outside teeth and lower-inside teeth
have nothing to wear against as they grow, and ridges and sharp points result.
These areas restrict the horse’s normal side-to-side rotary chewing motion.

Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

This restriction causes pain to the horse when he chews, and may cause him
to drop his food. These sharp points can also cause sores, or ulcers, on the
lining of the cheeks or on the tongue. Horses with this problem tend to chew
their food abnormally or incompletely. They can be prone to choking, colic,
or weight loss (see Chapter 11 for more about colic). These sharp points also
hurt the horse when the noseband is tightened and when the bit hits the
horse’s teeth.
To keep ridges and points from getting to the point where they hurt your horse,
you need to have his teeth filed — called floating or dressing the teeth — 
periodically. See Chapter 4 for more details on this procedure.
Step on it: The hooves
The expression “no hoof, no horse” is truer than we’d like it to be. Your horse’s
hooves are the foundation for his structure and his ability to move. If they
aren’t in good shape, neither is your horse.
Your horse’s hooves are made of what’s called cornified material, which is a
tough, fibrous protein. The bottom of the hoof is made up of the heel, bars,
frog, sole, outer wall, and white line. The hoof wall is divided into sections:
the toe, quartet, and heel (see Figure 10-6). The hard, insensitive areas of the
hoof — the heel, bars, frog, sole, heel bulbs, and the outer wall — are called
the hoof capsule, and are made of hoof horn. The hoof capsule houses and
supports structures such as the coffin bone, the very important hoof-shaped
bone within the horse’s foot. Between the coffin bone and the hoof capsule is
tissue lined with blood vessels and nerve endings, called the laminae. (See
Chapter 11 for more about the coffin bone and the laminae.)
171
Chapter 10: Introducing the Anatomy of a Horse
A cool trick: Telling your horse’s age 
by looking at his teeth
You may already know that you can tell a horse’s
approximate age by looking at his teeth. As a
horse gets older, the length, color, shape, and
markings of his teeth change. As the teeth grow,
the surfaces also wear down and change their
shape. Dark marks in the surface of the teeth —
called dental cups — slowly appear and then
disappear with age. The number and condition
of dental cups visible in a horse’s mouth may aid
in determining the horse’s approximate age.
A mark in the horse’s upper incisors called the
Galvayne’s groove also helps determine age. The
mark appears on the outside surface of the upper
incisors after a horse hits about 10 years of age.
As the horse ages, the groove expands down-
ward. By the time a horse reaches 20, the groove
extends all the way to the end of the tooth.

The function of your horse’s hoof is not only to carry your horse’s weight and
protect it from excessive impact from the ground, but also to protect the
coffin bone and laminae from damage. The frog portion of the hoof acts as a
cushion that aids in the circulation of the lower leg.
When your horse stands or moves, weight is borne on different parts of his
hoof, depending on the way that he’s built and how he moves. Wild horses
don’t need to have their feet trimmed because they gradually wear them
down as they move in their daily lives — as much as 20 miles a day. Domestic
horses who are barefoot don’t move as much as wild horses and therefore
don’t wear their feet down naturally. Horses who wear shoes can’t wear down
their feet at all. That’s why domestic horses need their feet trimmed by a far-
rier. (See Chapter 4 for more information about hoof care.)

Tackling Common Ailments
In This Chapter
 Understanding lameness issues
 Recognizing digestive disorders
 Exploring skin, eye, respiratory, and other common problems
C
onsidering how big, strong, and powerful horses are, it’s amazing how
prone they are to illness. Some people (like your authors, for example)
believe that many of these problems are related to the way that humans manage
horses in captivity. Wild horses don’t suffer from most of these issues, in large
part because they live the way nature  intended horses to live.
In this chapter, we help you get a handle on some of the problems your domestic
horse may unfortunately encounter. You find out about soundness and digestive
troubles, which are the two most prevalent health issues for horses. You also
discover illnesses affecting the horse’s skin, eyes, respiration, and metabolism.
Hopefully, when you finish perusing this chapter, you’ll have a good handle on
the kinds of conditions that your horse may be prone to.
Getting a Leg Up on Soundness Issues
One of the most widespread health issues in the horse world concerns
soundness. Soundness refers to a horse’s ability to move freely and without
pain, at all the natural gaits (walking, trotting, and cantering), and to be free
of any disease. Unfortunately, many horses become unsound at some point in
their lives, and some become so permanently.
Recognizing unsoundness in your horse and understanding the various
causes make it easier for you to help your veterinarian give your horse the
help that he needs.

Arthritis
Arthritis is the most common cause of soundness problems in horses. Basically,
arthritis is an inflammation of the joints. Horses tend to develop arthritis in
their knees, hocks, and fetlocks (see Chapter 10 for an illustration of these
parts of the horse). The joints become painful, and the condition tends to
worsen over time.
Veterinarians recognize four different types of arthritis:
 Degenerative joint disease (DJD). The most common form of arthritis,
degenerative joint disease develops as horses age. Horses who have
been worked hard are most likely to develop this type of arthritis.
Most cases of DJD affect the hocks. The knees are the next most com-
monly affected joint, followed by the fetlocks and stifles. Horses with
poor conformation and those who have worked hard in their lives are
most susceptible to this condition.
Symptoms of DJD can include chronic stiffness and swelling around a
joint, inability to perform activities that used to be easy, and bumps or
swellings on the legs.
Your veterinarian has a few different treatment options available to tackle
DJD. The goal with each is to stop the cycle of inflammation in the joint.
Stopping the cycle may include injection of the joint with hylauronic acid.
Other treatments may include corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatories, and oral joint supplements containing glucosamine,
chondroitant, and MSM. Alternative therapies, particularly acupuncture
and Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine, have also proven helpful.
(See Chapter 14 for details about alternative therapies for horses.)
DJD can’t always be prevented, but you can help minimize the likelihood
that this debilitating condition will cripple your horse. Keeping your
horse’s feet trimmed properly (see Chapter 4 for details), riding him on
surfaces that provide good footing (such as a well-maintained riding
arena or flat, rock-free trails), and not working him too hard, especially
when he’s not properly conditioned, can help stave off DJD.
 Septic joint arthritis. Septic arthritis occurs when the horse has an
infection of the joint and the by-products of the infection and accom-
panying inflammation cause degradation of the cartilage. This degrada-
tion causes a change in the biomechanical properties of the cartilage.
An infected joint in an adult horse can be the result of direct trauma with
an accompanying bacterial or fungal contamination. The most common
causes of joint infections are puncture wounds, infection secondary to
joint injections, and surgery followed by a generalized bacterial infection.
Heat, pain, and severe lameness are signs of septic arthritis.
174
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

If your horse ever suffers a joint injury, call your veterinarian right away.
Septic arthritis can be not only career-ending, but also life-ending.
Your veterinarian will treat this condition with antibiotics or another
drug, depending on the type of organism affecting the joint.
Arthroscopic surgery may also be necessary to treat the joint.
To help prevent septic arthritis, have your horse seen immediately if he
experiences a joint injury.
 Immune-mediated arthritis. This type of arthritis is actually quite rare
in horses. Experts suspect that immune-mediated arthritis is secondary
to lupus erythematosis, an immune-mediated disease that causes the
immune system to go haywire and destroy normal tissue. Although con-
sidered rare, coauthor Dr. Kate suspects that veterinarians may be diag-
nosing this illness more in the future because its existence is becoming
more well-known.
Symptoms can include joint pain, lameness, lack of appetite, and fever.
Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications and chemotherapy
drugs. Veterinarians don’t know how to prevent immune-mediated arthritis.
 Traumatic arthritis. Traumatic arthritis is common and caused by 
repetitive injury or sometimes an isolated trauma to the joint. Horses who
are worked too much and too hard can suffer from this type of arthritis.
It’s similar to DJD (see the earlier bullet), and viewed as the same by some
veterinarians. It’s usually treated with the same remedies.
Hoof problems
Issues that arise because of some insult to the hoof can cause problems for
your horse. The good news is that these problems are fixable, and they’re
often preventable with good care.
Hoof cracks
Hoof cracks are just what they sound like: cracks in the hoof. They can begin
from the coronet band and extend downward, or begin at the toe and go upward.
Cracks that extend from the bottom up are most common, and may be due to
poor hoof care. In these cases, the hooves become overly long, brittle, and dehy-
drated. (Chapter 4 has tips on good hoof care so that your horse can be clear of
cracks.) Some cracks are secondary to a condition called seedy toe, where the
hoof wall separates from the sensitive laminae — not a good thing!
175
Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

The major types of cracks include the following:
 Hoof cracks that start from the bottom up may not be a big problem, but
if your horse develops one of these, you need to determine why it
occurred. Also, if the crack progresses and extends into the deeper
structures of the foot, it can lead to a hoof abscess (see the next section
for more information).
 Cracks that are consistently found at the quarters and heels of the hoof
are a concern. The horse needs to be evaluated for poor conformation
or poor shoeing or trimming practices.
 Hoof cracks that start at the coronet band and go down are usually
caused by an injury or trauma, and result in a lack or unusual growth of
horn at the injured site. You’ve likely seen a similar crack in people who
have had an injury to their fingernail bed and forever after have a
deformed nail.
Your veterinarian should treat any trauma to your horse’s coronet band
immediately. Deep infections or trauma to this part of the hoof can
cause severe and permanent problems.
Common and simple hoof cracks often can be easily treated by a good farrier.
A special shoe may be applied, and the horse may be limited to stall rest or
only very light exercise while the crack grows out.
Hoof cracks are best prevented with good hoof care. Make certain that your
farrier knows what he or she is doing. (For details on how to find a good far-
rier, see Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by coauthor Audrey with Janice
Posnikoff, DVM [Wiley].)
Hoof abscesses
A hoof may seem like a weird place for an abscess, but horses get them all
the time. Hoof abscesses can cause severe lameness. Often, they start at the
bottom of the hoof at the white line and work their way up into the laminae.
They eventually break open at the coronary band and drain out. The subsolar
abscess is usually caused by a puncture wound on the bottom of the hoof
that becomes infected. Abscesses can cause sudden and severe lameness.
Veterinarians diagnose hoof abscesses by observing clinical symptoms and
examining the limb. If the lameness is sudden and on only one leg, and if an
increased digital pulse is present, an abscess is likely. Sensitivity to hoof testers
may also point to an abscess.
To treat an abscess, your veterinarian may open it up on the sole of the hoof
by using a hoof knife. By opening the abscess, the veterinarian enables it to
drain out with the help of gravity. He or she then soaks the hoof in Epsom
176
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

salts, or other drawing agents, because this helps draw out the pus from the
abscess and reduce inflammation. The vet may also choose to administer
anti-inflammatory drugs.
The prognosis for hoof abscesses is usually very good. Most horses recover
fully in three to five days. (Figure 11-1 shows the treatment of an abscess.)
To avoid having your horse go through this unpleasant ordeal, keep your
pastures free of nails and other debris that your horse can step on. Examine
your horse’s feet daily for nails and puncture wounds. If you find anything,
contact your veterinarian immediately, even if your horse isn’t showing signs
of lameness.

Laminitis
One of the strangest soundness problems that affects horses is laminitis. Also
known as founder, this condition results when the lamina in the hoof are severely
inflamed. This inflammation can lead to disruption in the attachment of the
coffin bone to the hoof, allowing the coffin bone to rotate out of its normal align-
ment. The consequence of this rotation is tremendous pain in the affected leg.
Figure 11-2 shows a normally aligned coffin bone, and Figure 11-3 shows
laminitis.

Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

The causes
Laminitis occurs when the blood supply to the horse’s legs is compromised.
The tissue that lines the coffin bone, called the laminae, degenerates rapidly
and the coffin bone slips out of its normal position.
A number of factors can cause the blood supply to the legs to short circuit.
One of these factors is diet. Abrupt changes in feed or a sudden substantial
increase in carbohydrates can lead to an imbalance of microorganisms in the
horse’s digestive system. Toxins are released from the digestive tract into the
bloodstream, wreaking havoc in the horse’s body.
Other causes of laminitis include:
 High doses or prolonged use of corticosteroids
 Obesity
 Bedding with black walnut shavings
 Severe colic (which we cover later in this chapter)
 Improper shoeing
 Retained placenta in mares after foaling
 Excessive exercise on hard surfaces (called road founder)
 Grazing on a lush pasture without gradual introduction (grass founder)
 Trailering long distances
 Any primary foot disease (any disease that affects the function of the
hoof, such as an abscess)
 Any illness with high fever
 Any metabolic problem, such as Cushing’s disease (we discuss these
types of problems later in this chapter)
Laminitis is a complicated disease. At this time, researchers need more pieces
to solve the puzzle. This condition is extremely serious and excruciatingly
painful for the horse. To help manage this terrible disease, you need immediate
attention from your equine veterinarian.
Certain equines are more prone to developing laminitis than others. Ponies
and draft horses seem more likely to have problems with this illness than other
horses. Also, horses who have foundered in the past are more likely to suffer
a recurrence of the condition.
179
Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
Veterinarians initially diagnose laminitis by observing the clinical signs of the
disease. These signs include lameness, a painful stance (where the horse leans
back on his heels while standing), increased digital pulses in the feet, and heat
in the foot. X-rays can confirm coffin bone rotation and the degree to which it
has occurred. Because coffin bone rotation may occur days to weeks after
the initial onset of laminitis, X-rays on day one may show no rotation, while
X-rays taken one week later may show significant rotation.
Treatment for laminitis may include anti-inflammatory drugs like phenylbuta-
zone (bute), drugs to help dilate blood vessels, drugs to help thin the blood,
antibiotics, and placing a special shoe on the affected leg or legs. Pain med-
ication is important, too, because laminitis is excruciating for the horse.
Acupuncture has also been shown to help in many cases.
The prognosis for a horse who’s suffering from laminitis depends on the degree
of rotation of the coffin bone. Many horses can recover from laminitis, although
the damaged tissue in the hoof may take almost a year to grow out. In very
severe cases, horses with laminitis are euthanized.
Horses recovering from laminitis need soft bedding or sand to help relieve
their pain and pressure on their hooves. This soft bedding or sand is not only
easier on the hooves, but also encourages the horse to lie down.
Because most cases of laminitis are diet related, this condition often is
preventable with good nutrition. Pay close attention to what you feed your
horse, and keep his weight down to a healthy level. (See Chapter 7 for infor-
mation on how to feed your horse, and Chapter 2 for details about determining
the proper body weight for your horse.)
If you even suspect that your horse has eaten too much of any good thing (he’s
gotten into the grain bin, for example), call your veterinarian immediately. Don’t
wait to see whether your horse develops symptoms of laminitis. Your vet can
take preventative measures to try to prevent the development of laminitis.
To get a jump on laminitis, feel your horse’s feet frequently so that you know
his normal hoof temperature. Plus, ask your veterinarian to show you how to
measure your horse’s digital pulse so that you can check it yourself if you
suspect laminitis.
180
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Navicular syndrome
A small bone in the horse’s hoof called the navicular bone is involved in various
ways in navicular syndrome, which can render a horse unsound in his front
legs (see Figure 11-4). Researchers believe that one cause of navicular syndrome
is the degeneration of the navicular bone as a result of decreased blood supply.
A more current theory on the condition suggests that it occurs as a result of
excessive force on the navicular bone, causing abnormal bone remodeling.
No one is sure how the problem arises, although many veterinarians suspect
a genetic link because some types of lower leg conformation seem to be
prevalent in horses with this condition.
To diagnose navicular, your veterinarian uses visible symptoms rather than
X-rays. These symptoms include consistent reluctance to stand with weight
on a particular leg and intermittent lameness. Nerve blocks and hoof testers
can help your vet rule out other issues and make a diagnosis of navicular 
syndrome.
Navicular syndrome doesn’t have a cure, but it can often be managed with
special shoeing, drugs to help increase the blood flow to the navicular bone,
intra-articular injections, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Some horses who
suffer severely from navicular syndrome may be helped by cutting the nerves
to the heel portion of the hoof. The horse can no longer feel the pain in the
caudal portion of his hoof after this procedure.
You can help prevent your horse from developing navicular by providing him
with good farrier care.

Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD)
Osteochondritis dissecans is a mouthful, so most people call this condition
OCD. A type of degenerative bone disease, OCD is basically a problem at the
cartilage’s cellular level, and starts when a horse is young and growing. The
cartilage in the young horse’s bones fails to ossify like it’s supposed to —
that is, it fails to turn into bone. So, instead of growing up like good cartilage
cells should, they remain as cartilage. This happens at the growth centers of
the horse’s bones, so as the horse matures, this abnormal cartilage gets
thicker and can separate from the underlying bone. It can also die, or wrinkle
up and become flaps and little loose pieces of cartilage floating around in the
joint capsule. (Coauthor Dr. Kate says that vets like to call these particles
“joint mice.”) These floating pieces of cartilage can make the joint very
painful and cause lameness.
OCD is believed to have several causes. It’s considered a developmental
orthopedic disease (DOD for short), and can be caused by rapid growth in
young horses, which is often caused by incorrect diet. Young horses who grow
too fast because they’re fed high-energy foods or have overweight mothers who
produce overly rich milk can develop OCD, as well as other DODs. Genetics can
also play a part in OCD, and some lines of horses show a greater tendency
toward this condition.
Underfed young horses can also develop OCD. Poor-quality and low-quantity
foods can lead to decreased bone growth, which puts additional stress on
bones. Both lack of food and too much food can cause a mineral imbalance,
which is believed to be behind OCD.
You can’t always tell whether your horse has OCD. Although some horses
display swelling of the affected area, others show no signs of it at all. Sometimes
they become lame and sometimes they don’t. The only definitive way to 
diagnose OCD is with the use of X-rays. If the OCD is giving the horse trouble,
your vet may prescribe joint injections with anti-inflammatory drugs or simply
prolonged rest. In cases that don’t respond to conservative treatment, surgery
may be in order.
The prognosis is good for some horses with OCD, especially after surgery in
some cases. After the offending OCD is removed, the horse can often live a
normal, active life.
182
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Ringbone
An insidious lameness problem by the name of ringbone (technically known
as phalangeal exostosis) is often diagnosed in horses. Ringbone is the devel-
opment of extra bone in or around the joint and affects the pastern and coffin
joints, usually in the forelegs. Low ringbone affects the coffin joint. High ring-
bone affects the pastern joint. High ringbone is worse than low ringbone
because it causes more pain and lameness in the horse.
Ringbone often starts out slow and shows itself as mild lameness. Eventually
more of the joint becomes involved with the disease, and the lameness
becomes worse.
No one is completely sure why ringbone develops in some horses and not
others, although certain factors seem to be involved. Those factors include
the following:
 Genetics. When horses with ringbone are bred, their offspring have a
tendency to develop the condition as well.
 Conformation. Horses who have very upright leg angles are more prone
to the condition.
 Poor hoof trimming. Uneven trimming causes trauma to the joint.
One of the most common forms of treatment for ringbone is therapeutic
shoeing. This involves special trimming and shoeing techniques that promote
balance in the horse’s feet. Anti-inflammatory drugs (taken orally or injected
directly into the joint) can also help manage this condition, but can’t cure it.
Nutraceuticals designed to support the joints, acupuncture, and Traditional
Chinese Medicine have also been shown to help.
Surgical treatment for ringbone calls for arthrodesing, which involves “freezing”
(or fusing) the joint to make it nonfunctional while still allowing the horse to
use the leg. Depending on the severity of the ringbone, this method may
produce a good outcome, especially if the problem is in the hind limbs.
Unfortunately, when extensive bone growth with joint involvement has
occurred, arthrodesing may be the only option. Even with this procedure,
many horses still have some lameness.
The best way to help protect your horse from ringbone is to make sure that he
gets proper hoof care from a reputable farrier. See Chapter 4 for more details.
183
Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Tendonitis
Tendonitis, or bowed tendon, is a common problem in hard-working horses.
In fact, experts estimate that 30 to 40 percent of all performance horses have
some degree of tendonitis.
Tendonitis is a condition that affects the lower foreleg. Some cases are acute,
while others are chronic. Sometimes, tendonitis is a precursor to a fracture,
back pain, or joint problems. It occurs when the tendons at the back of the leg
(the flexor tendons) are strained or torn. Jumping and galloping, especially in
deep footing, can cause a horse to develop tendonitis.
Tendonitis may be easy to spot. The horse acts lame, and the back of his leg
may be swollen and hot to the touch. The condition and its relative severity
can also be diagnosed by a veterinarian who’s using ultrasound.
Veterinarians treat tendonitis by trying to reduce the inflammation. This
treatment involves icing the leg, giving oral anti-inflammatory drugs, and
resting the horse. A tendon takes a long time to heal, and horses who suffer
from severe tendonitis often need six months to a year in order to recuperate.
Stem cell therapy is being used to combat this condition, and so is shock
wave therapy. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine
have also been shown to help.
Whatever form of treatment you choose to treat your horse’s tendonitis, it’s
imperative that the affected horse receive an ultrasound examination before
returning to work. Ultrasound helps to tell the veterinarian whether the
tendon has healed sufficiently enough to likely withstand the rigors of a
normal exercise routine.
Bowed tendons can sometimes be prevented by following these guidelines:
 Make certain that your horse is receiving good hoof care from a qualified
farrier (see Chapter 4).
 Ride your horse in footing that’s not too deep, slippery, or muddy. (If
you must ride in these conditions, keep your horse at a walk.)
 Rinse your horse’s legs with cold water after a workout. (Coauthor Dr.
Kate does this for all her horses to help keep their tendons healthy.)
 Make sure that splint boots, polo bandages, and leg wraps are properly put
on. The wrong application of leg protection can actually cause tendonitis.
184
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Trying to Stomach Digestive Problems
Horses are eating machines, designed by nature to spend most of their lives
ingesting and digesting. Put them in an artificial environment where they’re
given foods that they wouldn’t find in the wild, and then limit the time during
which they can eat, and you have a recipe for trouble.
Digestive problems are one of the biggest veterinary issues in the horse world.
The equine digestive tract doesn’t always function well in the confines of
domesticity. The result is a host of conditions that both horse owners and
veterinarians face on a regular basis. (Flip to Chapter 10 for general information
about a horse’s digestive system.)
Diarrhea
Recognizing diarrhea in your horse is easy. Loose, liquid feces are a sure 
sign of it.
Diarrhea can be caused by any number of things, including an infectious agent
(such as salmonella or clostridium bacterial diseases), Potomac Horse Fever
(a bacterial disease), antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication,
blister beetle ingestion, poisonous plants, and a heavy parasite burden. Bowel
strangulation or obstruction, peritonitis, and liver disease can also bring on
diarrhea.
Before even trying to find the cause of the diarrhea, your veterinarian treats
the condition to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. He or she
also gives aggressive supportive care to help prevent your horse from going
into shock or developing laminitis. In severe cases, your horse may have to be
admitted to a hospital, placed in intensive care, and possibly put in isolation.
A condition called chronic diarrhea is any diarrhea episode that lasts longer
than two to three weeks, with stool that’s wet and unformed, but not com-
pletely liquid. The cause of this type of diarrhea is the same as the cause of
acute diarrhea: parasites, internal issues (such as liver disease), salmonella
infection, chronic peritonitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and unfortunately,
cancer. Sometimes, nonspecific chronic diarrhea responds to a change in diet
to grass hay.
Getting a specific diagnosis on chronic diarrhea can be challenging for your
veterinarian, but it’s important to ultimately get one. Hit-or-miss treatments
may prolong the problem or, at best, be a temporary fix that may seriously
delay resolution of the problem.
185
Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

If your horse develops diarrhea, don’t wait to call your vet, especially if your
horse exhibits pain, fever, weakness, or lethargy. Diarrhea is a serious problem
that should be immediately addressed.
Enteroliths
Imagine having a giant rock growing in your intestines. Horses who suffer
from enteroliths have just that problem. A rock is literally growing inside them.
Enteroliths, also called “stones,” form inside horses as a result of something
that they may have eaten. Accidentally ingesting sand, hay bale twine, or a
piece of wood starts the process. If the body fails to expel the foreign object,
it becomes a nidus — essentially, it’s like the pearl in an oyster. The horse’s
body tries to get rid of it while protecting itself, so it deposits mucous, miner-
als, and food around the object. That process, along with the normal peri-
staltic movements of the gut, turns the mass into a hard, rocklike ball.
Enteroliths are usually round, but they can assume other interesting shapes
as well. Horses can pass very small enteroliths in their feces, or the stones
can float around in the GI tract and cause impactions that can lead to fatal
colic. (We discuss impactions later in this chapter.)
Some enteroliths can be seen on X-rays or felt by your veterinarian on rectal
palpation. Most often, they’re found with exploratory surgery. The enterolith
must be surgically removed if the horse has any chance at surviving the
impaction.
Horses living anywhere in the U.S. can develop enteroliths, but this problem
is most often seen in the Southwestern states. California in particular has a
very high incidence of enteroliths. Some experts believe that alfalfa hay, which
is often fed to horses in California, combined with the high magnesium content
of the state’s water, contributes to the condition.
Because veterinarians aren’t completely sure why enteroliths form, no one
can say for certain how to prevent them. Some horse owners don’t give their
horses alfalfa for fear that stones may develop.
Gas colic
With all the fiber horses eat, it’s not surprising to find out that they can some-
times suffer from gas. Colic can result when excessive gas production causes
gas to become trapped in the cecum and large colon. This can be extremely
painful to the horse. After all, just think about how you feel when you have
severe gas pains. It’s not fun.
186
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Most cases of gas colic are simply the result of gas not being passed the way
that it should. In other situations, gas colic can be a sign of an intestinal
blockage or a twisted intestine. A gas-filled bowel can even rupture if the
problem isn’t rectified.
Horses with gas colic may paw the ground, roll repeatedly and kick at their
bellies (see Figure 11-5 for a horse who’s exhibiting some of these symptoms).
Bob Langrish
Veterinarians treat gas colic by giving the horse an IV-painkiller. Vets recom-
mend that you hand-walk your horse to help her pass the gas that’s causing
the problem. If this doesn’t do the trick, your vet may opt to give your horse
mineral oil or a laxative via a stomach tube. This can help stimulate move-
ment of the bowel and allow the offending gas to pass.
If your horse is showing signs of colic pain, contact your veterinarian right
away. It could be just a bit of gas, but it could also be something more serious.
To help prevent gas colic, make diet changes gradually in your horse.

Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Impactions
When a horse is impacted, dry manure has clogged up her intestines and
stopped her from being able to defecate. Impactions are very serious in
horses, and can be fatal if they’re not treated quickly.
Impactions occur most often when a horse is fed tough, dry, forage with a lot
of stems and not provided with enough water. Occurrences of impaction
increase in the colder months because horses don’t like to drink cold water —
a good reason to keep your horse’s water warm in the winter. Long stall rest
or a long trailer ride can also be a contributing factor to impaction, because a
horse’s bowels work better with exercise.
A horse suffering from an impaction may show signs of colic, including
pawing the ground, rolling repeatedly, or kicking at her belly. She may also be
unable to produce manure.
Impactions are treated with large amounts of mineral oil passed into the
horse’s stomach through a tube in the nose. If this treatment doesn’t make
the impaction pass, the vet may give oral or intravenous hydration to the
horse to help moisten the impaction and make it passable. If this tactic fails,
surgery may be the only option for removal of the impaction.
If your horse must be confined for a period of time, ask your veterinarian for
suggestions on how to prevent impactions in your horse. Soaking your horse’s
hay is one way to help decrease the likelihood of your horse becoming impacted.
Sand colic
If you ate your food off the ground, you’d probably end up with a belly full of
sand. Well, that’s what often happens to horses who live in areas with sandy
soil. As they graze or munch on their hay, they accidentally ingest particles 
of sand.
The Southwestern states are most known for sand colic, which occurs when a
significant amount of sand builds up in the horse’s large intestine. It erodes
the lining of the gut and can cause extreme pain, diarrhea, depression, weight
loss, and decreased appetite.
Horses with sand colic are treated by being fed psyllium. The psyllium helps
the sand move through the large intestine and out of the horse’s system.
Horses who don’t respond to this treatment must have the sand removed
from the intestine surgically.
188
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to sand. Here are some tips:
 If you live in an area with sandy soil, avoid feeding your horse directly
off the ground. Use a feed bin, and put a stall mat underneath it. If some
of the food spills out, your horse isn’t eating directly off the ground.
 As a preventative for sand colic, give your horse 1 cup of dry psyllium
every day for a week, mixed with a complete feed, oats, or another kind
of grain mixture. This combination helps clear out any sand that may be
lurking in your horse’s gut before it becomes a problem.
Ulcers
Horses don’t have long commutes or sales quotas to make, but they still get
ulcers. In fact, 90 percent of all performance horses and horses in training have
some degree of stomach ulcers. These gastric ulcers are caused by stress, fre-
quent dosing of phenylbutazone or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories,
and certain diets, such as those lacking in adequate roughage.
Even baby horses can get ulcers, possibly indicating a bacterial link in some
cases. Foals affected with ulcers grind their teeth, salivate excessively, have a
decreased appetite, show pain after eating, and lie down more frequently
than unaffected foals.
Adult horses with ulcers often show no signs of illness, although some are
clearly uncomfortable. Frequent colic episodes may be a sign of possible ulcers.
The gold standard to confirm the presence of a gastric ulcer in horses involves
placing an instrument called an endoscope into the horse’s esophagus and
down to the stomach. By the time an ulcer is visible by endoscope, it’s already
causing the horse considerable discomfort because ulcers begin forming and
are painful before they can even be seen with endoscopy.
Treatment for ulcers requires that the horse’s stress be reduced, if possible.
If the horse is being given phenylobutazone for a medical condition, alfalfa
hay should be fed to help protect the stomach. Ulcer medication is also given
to a horse suffering from ulcers. Drugs by the name of cimetidine or famotidine
and omeprazole can help, and so can stomach ulcer protectors. Coauthor Dr.
Kate also uses Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine to treat ulcers and
has great success with it.
To help prevent gastric ulcers in your horse, feed her a diet high in roughage.
If your veterinarian prescribes a regimen of phenylobutazone for a health
issue, ask him or her about medication that can be given to your horse to
help prevent ulcers.

Saving Your Horse’s Skin: 
Examining Skin Disorders
Horses are big animals, so they have a lot of skin. They’re also prone to a
number of skin disorders. These problems are usually pretty obvious to the
astute horse owner, and can sometimes be alarming. The good news is that,
in most cases, skin problems aren’t fatal.
Allergies
Horses get allergies just like people do, and sometimes symptoms take the
form of hives, or urticaria. These hives usually appear as either small or large
wheals (anywhere from half an inch to a few inches in diameter) that may or
may not be itchy (see Figure 11-6).
Dr. Janice Sojka, Purdue University
Hives are usually brought on by hypersensitivity to drugs, feeds, insects,
chemicals, molds, dust, pollens, or any number of other substances. With so
many causative agents, finding the inciting culprit can be tricky. Your vet may
want to do skin or other allergy testing, or even a food trial to attempt to find
out exactly what’s causing your horse’s allergies.
The usual treatment is corticosteroids, either injected or oral. Determining
and eliminating the causative agent is also part of the prescription.
Figure 11-6:

Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Bacterial infections
Bacterial skin problems in horses are usually secondary to other problems that
disrupt the protective barrier of the skin. These secondary problems can include
trauma or injury, warm and humid weather, a dirty environment, and poor
hygiene. Figure 11-7 shows a typical bacterial infection.
Dr. Janice Sojka, Purdue University
A common bacterial skin problem in horses is called greasy heel, scratches,
or pastern dermatitis, and is a condition involving the underside of the pastern
or fetlock area. Like other bacterial skin problems, a predisposing factor —
such as moisture or an abrasion — is usually to blame. Horses with white
legs are most commonly affected. In some cases of pastern dermatitis, a fungus
or mite is involved. Whatever the cause, your vet needs to make an accurate
diagnosis for proper treatment and future prevention. (Treatment depends
on the source of the problem.)
Another, similar problem in horses with white legs results when urine hits the
ground and splashes onto the front of the hind legs. If it’s not cleaned or
rinsed often, it may also lead to a secondary bacterial infection that must be
treated with antibiotics.

191
Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Fungal infections
Fungal infections can be more than itchy and painful to your horse, causing
him to be irritable. Your veterinarian can use a Woods Light test to detect some
fungal species, but a fungal culture or microscopic exam may be needed for
diagnosis.
The most common fungal skin problem in horses is ringworm, which isn’t
actually a worm but a fungal infection that’s highly contagious to other horses
and humans. Called “ringworm” because the lesions often begin as small,
round areas of hair loss — sometimes with raised edges — this infection relies
on the presence of the fungal spores and skin abrasions to take hold (see
Figure 11-8). It’s most common during damp seasons, or when horses are
kept in damp, dark conditions with poor hygiene.
Dr. Janice Sojka, Purdue University
Most problems occur at the girth and saddle blanket areas, or the shoulders
and neck — areas where horses sweat the most. Ringworm can also be spread
by using dirty brushes, blankets, and other equipment on multiple horses.
Treatment for any kind of fungal infection is to avoid sharing grooming tools
between horses and to clean all tools thoroughly in anti-fungal cleansers.
Tack should be kept clean, especially girths and blankets. Horses affected by
ringworm should be bathed with an anti-fungal shampoo recommended by
your veterinarian. Vets may also give topical prescription medication to put
on your horse.
Figure 11-8:
Ringworm

192
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Another common fungal infection of the skin is rain scalds, sometimes called
rain rot. Technically called dermatophilosis, rain scalds are caused by a genetic
anomaly that has properties of both a fungus and a bacterium. The organism
responsible for rain scalds becomes active in damp weather and causes the
most trouble in rainy seasons or in warm, humid climates.
The organism responsible for rain scalds enters the skin at a break. A bug
bite or scratch is all that the organism needs to gain entry. Symptoms include
areas of matted hair with crusty scabs on your horse’s coat that look like
paintbrush strokes. These areas show up primarily on the back, hindquarters,
and thighs.
The best way to prevent rain scalds is to keep your horse dry in wet weather.
Provide him with shelter to escape from the rain, and provide a waterproof
blanket to wear during rainstorms. More severe cases may need veterinary
treatment.
Sarcoids
Sarcoids are benign tumors of the skin. The most common of all equine tumors,
sarcoids occur in horses of all ages but are most often seen in horses older
than 7 years of age.
Most sarcoid tumors occur on the head, neck, limbs, and ventral abdominal
area. The tumors can be solitary or occur in clusters, and they can be raised
or flat in appearance. They can also look like warts, or large, firm skin masses,
and usually come in one of two forms: flat and proliferative. (Figure 11-9 shows
sarcoid tumors.) Some researchers believe that sarcoids are the result of a
virus, although no conclusive evidence exists to prove this theory.

Sarcoids don’t spread (metastasize) through the body the way that cancerous
tumors do (we discuss skin cancers later in this chapter), but they can send
out tentacles that spread into the immediate area, making some of them very
difficult to eradicate. They can also be very persistent and locally invasive.
Depending upon the location and size of the tumor, surgical removal is an
option, but recurrence is common, even with very wide skin margins.
Sarcoids aren’t usually life threatening except when they develop in areas of
the body where normal function is affected. Sarcoids that develop on the anal
area can be a particular hazard because they can grow large enough to prevent
the horse from being able to defecate. Sarcoids around and in the eyes can
also be dangerous. If they become large or invasive, the eye may have to be
removed. That’s why lumps or bumps near your horse’s eyes warrant a visit
with your veterinarian. When sarcoids occur in areas that come into contact
with the saddle, girth, or other pieces of tack, surgical removal is often 
warranted.
Treatments for sarcoids include cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser therapy,
radiation therapy, and topical chemotherapy.
Seborrhea
Have you ever seen a horse with crusty skin on the front of his hind legs
between the hoof and the hock? This condition can be maddening if you have
a horse who suffers from it. No matter how much you wash his legs, you just
can’t get rid of the ugly crusts.
The technical term for these crusts is seborrhea. In most cases, seborrhea is
secondary to another problem. (Primary seborrhea, caused by a genetic
problem, is extremely rare in horses.) Also called cannon keratosis, secondary
seborrhea may be the skin’s response to the insult of bacteria, the contact of
urine (in geldings, it splashes up and hits the legs), or even too much sun.
The skin at the effected area may react by producing a greasy substance (see
Figure 11-10).
You can buy over-the-counter shampoos to treat secondary seborrhea. These
shampoos are labeled for such use, and can contain tar and sulfur, emollients,
or mild sulfur-salicylic acid. The shampoo that you choose should be determined
by which type of seborrhea your horse is experiencing. Treat seborrhea oleosa
with a tar and sulfur shampoo. Seborrhea sicca may respond to emollient
shampoos or mild keratolytic sulfur-salicylic acid shampoos. Your veterinarian
may be able to tell you which type of seborrhea you’re dealing with by taking
a biopsy of the affected area.
194
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

To help prevent secondary seborrhea, keep your horse’s hind legs clean by
washing them every few days. If your horse has pink skin on his hind legs,
consider putting sunscreen on them during the summertime.

Skin cancer
Every species of mammal seems to be prone to cancer, and horses are no
exception. Unlike in humans, cancer of the lungs, liver, kidney, and other vital
organs is uncommon in horses. However, horses are prone to skin cancers,
which can cause a lot of problems, including death.
If you see a growth on your horse’s skin that doesn’t go away after a week or
so, contact your veterinarian.
Melanoma
Especially common in older gray horses, melanoma is most often seen in
Arabians and Percherons because of the large number of gray horses in these
breeds. Three-quarters of these tumors are malignant, and they most often
occur in the skin. They usually show up on the perineum (the area between
the anus and the genitals), underside of the tail, around the eyes, and on the
limbs. One form of melanoma occurs in young horses who are less than 2
years of age. This melanoma is usually benign, and usually is different from
the melanomas of older horses.
Melanomas are usually under the skin and are black in color. Not all melanomas
are black, however. The only way to know for sure whether a tumor is
melanoma is through a biopsy.

Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Melanomas are most manageable when they’re diagnosed and treated early.
Removing these tumors surgically is the best way to prevent them from
spreading further, but some veterinarians prefer to use cryosurgery. In some
cases, vets opt to treat the tumor orally with a drug called cimetidine, which
can bring about partial to even full regression.
Squamous cell carcinoma
This malignant tumor originates in the epidermal cells of the skin. It tends to
develop in areas of the body in which some horses don’t have pigment. These
areas include the eyelids, nose, vulva, and penis. Chronic sun exposure is a
primary culprit.
Squamous cell carcinoma may initially appear as warts or granulation tissue,
and grows into raised, crusty lesions that don’t heal. This cancer doesn’t usu-
ally spread to the entire body, but it can be very locally invasive, especially in
the eye, where it can spread into the tear duct or sinuses. Because this type of
cancer can initially look like scar tissue, sarcoids, bacterial granuloma, or fungal
granuloma, only a veterinarian can determine its true nature with a biopsy.
Squamous cell carcinoma can be treated with cryotherapy, radiation therapy,
surgery, and various implants.
Watching Out for Eye Problems
The eyes are the window to the soul, and this statement is especially true of
horses. Few things are sadder than a horse with eye problems. These conditions
often are not only painful, but also very troubling to the horse. Because horses
are prey animals, they depend a lot on their sight to feel safe.
All eye problems require immediate veterinarian attention. Most eye problems
are quite painful, so your vet may perform a nerve block and/or sedate your
horse before examining her eyes. The vet also may use topical anesthetic eye
drops to lessen pain.
Coauthor Audrey lost her beloved Appaloosa mare Rosie to eye disease several
years ago, and knows all too well how insidious eye problems can be.
Blocked tear ducts
Horses live in dusty, plant-filled environments, and sometimes their tear ducts
become blocked as a result. Blocked tear ducts (technically called the naso-
lacrimal ducts) can make your horse’s eye tear excessively, leaving her with a
constantly wet face. It happens because dust or pollen plugs up the ducts,
causes swelling, and keeps the tears from draining normally through the sinuses
196
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

and out through the nose. This ailment is most common during allergy season
and when the weather is hot, dry, and windy.
Bacteria can feed on the excess tears and cause itching and irritation. The
itching and irritation, in turn, cause your horse to rub her face and possibly
damage her eyes. This is why it’s important to have your vet examine your
horse if her tear ducts appear to be blocked. Your vet can clear the ducts,
and also check to make sure that no other, more serious issues are at play.
If your horse develops blocked tear ducts, your vet may put a tube into the
tear ducts by going through your horse’s nose. He or she then flushes the
ducts with solution to clear the blockage.
To prevent blocked tear ducts, try to minimize the dust in your horse’s envi-
ronment. If your hay is very dusty, soak it in water before feeding it to your
horse. Water arenas and dusty paddocks during dry times of year.
Cataracts
Horses get cataracts just like people do. In horses, however, the condition
can not only develop with age, but also be present at birth. If your horse has
a large and diffuse cataract, you may easily see it. It presents itself as a gray
colored pupil.
Congenital cataracts, which are present in newborn foals, may be removed by
a veterinary ophthalmologist with the greatest likelihood of a successful 
surgical outcome. Acquired cataracts usually are secondary to another eye
problem like ERU (which we discuss later in this chapter), but they may be
the result of old age.
Cataracts can be present in one or both of a horse’s eyes. They can affect your
horse’s vision because they prevent light from getting through to the retina.
The maturity of the cataract determines how much vision the horse loses.
Several years ago, coauthor Dr. Kate’s husband bought a 21-year-old gelding
to be his first cutting horse. The horse had to be retired only two years later
because of cataracts. He had trouble seeing at night, and couldn’t be ridden
in the evening unless a full moon was in the sky. Eventually, he became
unsafe to ride at night at all.

Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Corneal ulcers
Corneal ulcers or abrasions are injuries to the surface of the cornea that
result from injuries to the eye. Trauma, burns, chemicals, and even dirt or
debris can cause corneal ulcers.
This condition is extremely painful, as are most eye problems. Untreated
corneal ulcers can lead to other eye problems and loss of vision or the eye
itself if untreated.
Veterinarians use a stain to determine the extent of the ulcer, and may manage
the problem with ophthalmic antibiotics and ophthalmic atropine if bacteria
are involved. Your vet may culture the ulcer to see what kind of bacterial or
fungal agents may be destroying the cornea. Deep corneal ulcers that don’t
respond to medication may require surgical intervention.
Corneal ulcers are difficult to prevent, but they can be treated successfully if
you catch them early. Pay close attention to your horse’s eyes, and don’t
hesitate to call the vet if your horse is squinting, tearing, or rubbing her eye.
Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU)
Also called moonblindness or periodic ophthalmia, equine recurrent uveitis
(ERU) is the most common cause of equine blindness. The condition comes
and goes, and is primarily a problem in the acute phase.
Uveitits, which means inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye, may
be caused by trauma, a septic infection, certain bacterial or parasitic infections,
or an immune-mediated disease. Some researchers believe that a genetic
component may be involved as well.
In the acute phase, uveitis causes considerable pain, excessive tearing, and
sensitivity to light (see Figure 11-11). The condition is treated symptomatically
with anti-inflammatories and pain medications that may be administered 
topically, orally, and by injection. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese
Veterinary Medicine has also proven to be helpful.
If your horse is diagnosed with uveitis, you can manage the condition by
keeping a close watch for symptoms, and instituting treatment immediately
when the problem recurs. You want to initiate treatment immediately,
because each episode may cause some degree of permanent damage to the
eye. Good management of this condition often helps minimize the speed of
progression of the disease.

A Common Respiratory Problem: Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Because horses are such athletic creatures, equine respiratory problems can
create huge issues. Riding your horse in a show, competition, or even just on
the trail is hard if he’s having trouble breathing.
One of the most common respiratory diseases that’s seen mainly in the older
horse is COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the equine
version of asthma, and it causes a horse to have difficulty breathing in, and
even more difficulty breathing out. COPD is also called recurrent airway
obstruction (RAO) or heaves. This illness causes inflammation and spasms
within the lungs. It’s usually triggered by airborne allergies to mold, dust, and
pollen, or by poor air quality.
Horses with COPD have shortness of breath during exercise, chronic coughing,
and wheezing. They also often may develop a heave line, which is a line of
developed muscle along the belly. It forms as a result of the horse’s struggle
to push air out of his lungs.
Just like some humans are born with a predisposition to asthma, some horses
are born with a predisposition to COPD. To keep it from showing up in your
horse, you can take a few precautions. These precautions include providing
good ventilation in your horse’s stall or keeping him in a pasture with shelter,
giving your horse hay and bedding that’s low in dust, and feeding your horse
from a ground feeder to help him clear his nasal passages as he eats.

Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

If your horse is diagnosed with COPD, your veterinarian may treat him with
bronchodilators and/or corticosteroids. He or she may also suggest that you
soak your horse’s hay in water before feeding, or switch to pellets or hay
cubes. Most horses with COPD do better when housed outdoors, because
barn environments can be very dusty.
Surveying Other Systemic Problems
Issues that affect your horse’s entire system are scary. Discovering that your
horse is suffering from a systemic problem can be a frightening realization.
Fortunately, veterinary science has made great inroads into diagnosing and
treating these issues in the past 10 years, making it easier on affected horses
and their owners.
Anhidrosis
“No sweat!” is generally something you like to hear — unless it applies to
your horse. Some horses can develop a metabolic problem called anhidrosis,
which is the inability to produce normal amounts of sweat.
The condition has a range of seriousness, from the extreme of a horse who
has no ability to sweat, to a horse who simply produces less sweat than she
should at certain temperatures and levels of exercise. The problem can be
seasonal; some horses with this problem do fine in the cooler seasons, but
have trouble when the weather heats up and humidity elevates.
Your horse depends heavily on sweating to regulate her body temperature.
Sweat is critical so that evaporation can cool her down and keep her body
temperature from becoming dangerously high. When a horse stops sweating,
she tries to cool herself through an elevated respiratory rate or even panting,
which isn’t very effective. And the body temperature of a horse who can’t
sweat may elevate as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit. (The normal body
temperature for a horse is between 99 and 101.5.) Add exercise to the equation,
and the horse’s body temperature can go as high as 108 degrees. Brain damage
is highly likely when body temperature exceeds 106 degrees.
Veterinarians believe that anhidrosis may result from a malfunction in the
physiological or neural pathways involved in sweating. One theory is that the
constant stimulation of sweat gland receptors wears them out, so to speak,
and they quit responding. The problem is most common in the southern U.S.,
and especially in areas of higher humidity, but it can show up anywhere given
the right conditions. Even horses who sweat normally can have episodes of
anhidrosis, given the right set of circumstances of weather conditions, workload,
and stress.
200
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Your horse should normally cool off within 30 minutes after exercise. If your
horse doesn’t seem to be cooling off, check her rectal temperature. If it’s above
normal, and your horse is also breathing rapidly, has decreased energy, lethargy,
and a lack of sweating, contact your veterinarian.
If your vet suspects anhidrosis, he or she may choose to test your horse to see
whether the sweat glands are functioning properly. Anhidrosis has no proven
treatments, but environmental adjustment (moving the horse from a hot, humid
climate to a drier, cooler area of the country) tends to provide the best results.
Some horses may be managed with misting fans, stall air conditioning, or by
choosing to exercise them in the coolest part of the day. Horses with milder
cases may respond to dietary supplements containing a combination of cobalt,
vitamin C, L-tyrosine, and niacin. Some horses may benefit from methyl dopa
and/or electrolytes. Other horses respond to acupuncture and Traditional
Chinese Veterinary Medicine.
Treatment isn’t 100 percent effective in all cases of this no-sweat conundrum.
In cases where horses don’t respond to treatment, house them in cool envi-
ronments on hot days, making sure that they have plenty of shade and venti-
lation. They should be worked only at cool times of the day or at night during
hot weather.
Exertional rhabdomyolysis (tying up)
Exertional rhabdomyolysis — more commonly known as “tying up” or
azoturia — happens to some horses, often after extreme exercise following
several days without much exercise, and while fed grain, especially high
carbohydrate feeds. It may occur when a horse is overexerted when she’s not
fit to perform the work being asked of her. It can also occur when a horse is
experiencing an electrolyte imbalance, heat exhaustion, or possibly a vitamin
E deficiency.
The signs of exertional rhabdomyolysis include sudden hind limb stiffness or
lameness, muscle cramping, refusal to move, and other distress, such as
increased heart and respiration rates, sweating, and acting colicky. Veterinarians
diagnose exertional rhabdomyolysis based on your horse’s behavior, and
through a blood test for elevated muscle enzyme levels. If your horse’s creatine
kinase levels are moderately elevated, the prognosis for recovery is good and
the damaged muscle tissue will heal in a few months. In severe cases, horses
can have a guarded prognosis for healing and future competition.
The possibility of exertional rhabdomyolysis makes it very important to
carefully warm up your horse before exercise, and to gradually get her in
condition for hard work.
201
Chapter 11: Tackling Common Ailments

Diet is extremely important for horses prone to exertional rhabdomyolysis.
Limit starch in the diet, and avoid feeds that produce a grain high. (See
Chapter 7 for more on how to feed your horse.) Diets developed specifically
for horses with exertional rhabdomyolisis can be a huge help.
Metabolic problems
Horses are prone to several different metabolic problems. Each of these prob-
lems has a different origin, yet all are closely related. Diagnosis can be tricky,
but finding out which one of these problems may be affecting your horse is
important.
Although the solution to metabolic problems may be as simple as changing
your horse’s diet, any hormonal metabolic problem becomes more difficult to
treat the longer it progresses. If you suspect any of the problems described in
this section, have your veterinarian test your horse for a metabolic condition.
The following conditions are often difficult to differentiate, and ongoing
research is constantly changing the equine veterinarian’s understanding of
these syndromes, diagnostic testing, and management:
 Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) has, in the past, been called peripheral
Cushings disease. Many horses who suffer from EMS are insulin resistant.
Symptoms often appear in the form of fat deposits at the base of the tail
and crest of the neck (see Figure 11-12). These animals are often prone
to developing laminitis. Current recommended management of EMS
consists of regular exercise and a low-carbohydrate diet (no pasture, a
grass hay diet, little or no low carbohydrate grain, and balanced vitamin
and mineral supplementation). If your horse isn’t on pasture, she may
need vitamin E supplementation.
 Cushings syndrome is more accurately referred to as pituitary pars
intermediary dysfunction (PPID). Because a portion of the pituitary gland
becomes unable to function properly, ACTH (a hormone) and blood
cortisol levels are chronically too high. Horses who suffer from Cushings
syndrome may also be insulin resistant, and they often have a long, curly
haircoat (so they’re often sweaty because they’re hot). They’re prone 
to developing laminitis, chronic infections, and loss of muscle mass
(producing a pot-bellied appearance), and they may have increased water
intake and urine output. This condition can’t be cured, but many horses
can be managed with drugs such as pergolide or cyprohepadine. Because
much research is currently being done on this condition, your equine
veterinarian may have newer, better information for diagnosing and
treating this condition in the future.

Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

 Primary hypothyroidism was once thought to cause many adult horses
and ponies to develop cresty necks and excess fat at the tail head. Although
many horses with this condition do have lower than normal blood thyroid
hormone levels, many experts now think that this is a result of their
overweight condition rather than a cause of it. Researchers found that
horses who had their thyroid glands removed didn’t develop this classic
appearance. In addition to primary hypothyroidism, a congenital form of
hypothyroidism is occasionally seen in foals.

H
orses are social creatures, and they have a host of infectious diseases
that plague them to prove it! Passed from horse to horse or by a parasitic
host, these diseases are dangerous and can be fatal.
In this chapter, we give you the basics on a number of common infectious dis-
eases that can affect your horse. As soon as you see any suspicious symptoms,
be sure to contact your veterinarian immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
The good news is that vaccines and other prevention methods are available for
many of these problems. After reading this chapter, you’ll be motivated to keep
your horse inoculated. (Flip to Chapter 4 for the basics of equine vaccinations.)
A Toxin Produced by Bacteria: Botulism
Most people have heard of botulism, the deadly disease that infects food and
causes severe illness and often death. Although botulism is most often thought
of as something that can show up in canned food, the disease is actually a
problem for horses as well.
Horses are affected by the toxin that’s produced by the bacterium Clostridium
botulinum. These bacterial organisms are strict anaerobes, which means that
they can’t live in the presence of air. These organisms produce seven different
types of toxins, and these neurotoxins cause very distinct symptoms. Protection
from one type doesn’t cross-protect for another.
Horses can be infected with the botulism toxin in three different ways:
 With any deep puncture wound or when a wound results in considerable
dead tissue.

 When a rodent or other animal dies in a field where hay is cut and
processed. The tightly compressed hay bales limit the amount of oxygen
that comes in contact with the dead animal, creating a perfect growth
environment for the oxygen-hating Clostridium botulinum. The horse
accidentally ingests the bacteria when eating the hay or hay cubes.
 When the horse ingests bacteria that’s living in pasture soil. After the
horse accidentally swallows it, the bacteria begins to grow and produce
toxins in the gastrointestinal tract. These toxins are absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. From there, it goes to the
nerves throughout the body.
After a horse absorbs the bacteria, production of the toxin takes place within
the horse’s gastrointestinal tract.
Symptoms
Botulism causes weakness and paralysis. Muscles that are involved with
standing and moving, as well as swallowing, are often involved first.
The first sign you may notice in your horse is the inability to swallow or a lot
of drooling. The horse may not be able to get up after lying down, and he may
begin to lose control of his muscles. In the early stages, this loss of control
may cause extreme anxiety in the horse. You may also see his muscles quiver
and tremble.
Affected horses may also fall abruptly when trying to lie down. The third eyelid
begins to protrude, and the horse can’t control his tongue. The internal muscles
are also affected, and the horse can’t control his bladder. His digestive system
stops working properly. Finally, the diaphragm, which is the largest muscle
involved with breathing, stops functioning, resulting in the horse’s death.
Diagnosis and treatment
No specific diagnostic test for botulism exists, and blood work on affected
horses is typically normal. Veterinarians make a diagnosis based on clinical
signs. Although serum and feces can be submitted to a lab for toxin analysis,
the vet will probably begin treatment immediately because time is of the
essence when you’re combating this disease.
Treatment involves giving the horse hyper immune plasma that’s very high in
antitoxin titers. However, because botulism types vary, the vet has to use plasma
that’s specific to the particular toxin that affected the sick horse.
206
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Treatment is costly, and unfortunately, after the disease progresses and the
toxin adheres to nerve cells, the antibodies are ineffective. Treatment is then
aimed at providing intense nursing care for the horse until his body can make
new neuromuscular transmissions and restore nerve function. This can take
seven to ten days, and all the horse’s bodily functions must be supported in
the meantime. This support involves providing fluids, feeding the horse through
a nasogastric tube, and giving him antibiotics to combat secondary infections.
Prevention
To help prevent botulism, inspect your horse’s hay regularly for animal 
carcasses that may have been accidentally baled into it. If you find animal parts,
don’t feed the rest of the bale to your horse, and keep an eye on him for possible
symptoms. Wound botulism can be prevented by calling a veterinarian right
away if your horse seriously injures himself. Immediate treatment of the
wound can help ward off botulism.
Affecting the Nervous System:
Encephalomyelitis
Encephalomyelitis is a viral disease of the nervous system. Three strains of
the same disease can infect horses. Called Western equine encephalomyelitis
(WEE), Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), and Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE), the illness can cause severe neurological symptoms
and often death. EEE and WEE are most prevalent in the U.S., but VEE is
becoming more common, especially in the South.
The virus lives in hosts like birds and rodents, and all strains of equine
encephalomyelitis viruses are spread by blood-sucking insects, specifically
the mosquito. A mosquito bites the host and then transfers the virus from
the host to the horse by biting.
Symptoms
Symptoms of equine encephalomyelitis viruses can be lethargy, lack of appetite,
and persistent fever. If the virus isn’t successfully cleared by the horse’s immune
system after the initial infection, the disease can cause neurological behaviors
such as circling, seizures, stumbling, and lethargy. As the disease progresses,
the horse may begin head pressing (pressing the head against a wall or other
207
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

object), become blind, and fall into a coma. Horses with VEE may have diarrhea
or lethargy, or they may die before they show neurological signs. Pregnant
mares who contract the disease may abort their babies. Some horses experience
bleeding of the lungs.
EEE and VEE are especially deadly, and in severe cases that don’t respond to
treatment, the horse must be euthanized.
Diagnosis and treatment
The encephalomyelitis viruses may be diagnosed by blood tests, which isolate
antibodies to the disease, along with clinical symptoms, or on postmortem
testing.
No cure is known for equine viral encephalomyelitis, but veterinarians can
provide supportive treatment for affected horses in the form of intravenous
fluids, anti-inflammatories, and anti-diarrhea medications.
Prevention
Vaccinating your horse is the best way to prevent serious infection with
encephalomyelitis. Your veterinarian can recommend a vaccine protocol that
is appropriate for your particular area of the country.
Eliminating areas where mosquitoes can breed is another way to help control
encephalomyelitis. Here are a few tips:
 Remove standing water from your property. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in
standing water, and the larvae hatch and grow there. Eliminating water
where the insects can lay their eggs can help reduce mosquito populations.
 If you have a water trough for your horses, stock it with mosquitofish. The
fish will eat the mosquito larvae and reduce the number of mosquitoes
that may bite your horse. Mosquitofish are often available at no charge
from county vector control agencies.
 Spray your horse with mosquito repellent during mosquito season, and
try to keep her indoors at night (or during the dusk and dawn mosquito
feeding times) if at all possible. You can buy mosquito repellent
designed specifically for use on horses at your local tack and feed store,
in equine product catalogs, or on the Internet.
208
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

A Disease in Three Forms: Equine 
Herpes Virus (EHV)
The viral disease equine herpes virus (EHV), also known as rhinopneumonitis,
has gotten more publicity lately because highly contagious neurological forms
of the disease have become more prevalent. Horses transmit EHV to one another
through direct contact or by coughing or snorting and releasing the virus
into the air.
Symptoms
The symptoms of EHV depend on the form:
 The neurological form of herpes can start with mild fever, slight lethargy,
and mild respiratory signs such as a cough.
 The respiratory form usually begins with a cough, fever, and nasal
discharge. Many horses also develop a loss of appetite and lethargy,
while some horses aren’t affected much at all.
 The abortion form of EHV can be a silent and deadly killer. A mare
infected with the virus in the last trimester of pregnancy can abort her
fetus two weeks to several months after infection. Some foals may escape
abortion but are weak and sickly and die soon after birth. Some mares
show a respiratory infection, but many don’t.
Diagnosis and treatment
Neurological EHV can show the same symptoms as many other neurological
diseases discussed in this chapter, such as WEE, EPM, and rabies. You can
help your vet make the proper diagnosis by maintaining good vaccine records
and allowing him or her to perform the appropriate diagnostic tests. These
include microscopic examinations of blood, nasal discharge, and tissue samples.
As with most viral diseases, no specific treatment exists for EHV. Most horses
recover with good nursing care, and antibiotics may help treat secondary
bacterial infections. Unless the horse’s fever is very high, coauthor Dr. Kate
prefers to let the disease run its course because the cyclical fever can be used
to help monitor the disease’s progress. Also, fever is part of the immune
system’s defense.
209
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

Prevention
The vaccines currently on the market are labeled to protect against the abortion
and the respiratory forms of EHV, not the neurological form. However, it’s
important to vaccinate against EHV because cross-protection may occur. The
vaccine will also stimulate your horse’s immune system.
As with other diseases, horses involved in activities such as racing, training,
showing, or transport are at an increased risk, not only due to exposure, but
also because of stress on the immune system. Do whatever you can to reduce
your horse’s stress level (see Chapter 3 for help), and limit your horse’s 
exposure to common water buckets at shows.
If you decide to breed your mare, be sure to ask your vet about proper vaccine
protocols, and be diligent about protection so that your mare doesn’t abort
as a result of EHV. Chapter 15 has more information on breeding horses.
Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA)
Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a disease that affects the blood. It’s caused by
a virus that’s spread between horses by biting horseflies. It can also be spread
by using needles, dental floats, and other contaminated equipment between
horses. Infected pregnant mares can pass the disease on to their babies if they
don’t abort them first.
Symptoms
Horses with a serious case of EIA have a high fever, are lethargic, and develop
anemia. They often develop thrombocytopenia (lack of platelets), which causes
hemorrhages (heavy bleeding) to occur on the gums and elsewhere. They may
also exhibit stocking up (swelling) of the lower legs and along the bottom of
the abdomen.
The signs of EIA develop 7 to 30 days after exposure to the virus. Horses can
die from EIA or become chronic carriers of the disease. These horses will have
an intermittent fever and weight loss.
Diagnosis and treatment
The best test for EIA is something called the Coggins test. Because EIA is so
serious and must be reported by law to state health authorities, blood for the
210
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Coggins test must be drawn by a licensed and accredited veterinarian, and
the sample submitted to a state-approved lab.
If a horse tests positive for EIA, he must be euthanized or quarantined for life
because this disease has no treatment, and infection is permanent. The infected
horse must be kept a minimum of 200 yards from any other equine. The virus
lives for only 15 to 30 minutes in the horsefly, so keeping horses this far apart
means that the virus usually dies before the infected fly can travel to get
another blood meal.
After a horse is deemed positive for EIA, most states also require an obvious
brand on the animal. Check with your veterinarian to find out your state’s
requirements for frequency of the Coggins test.
Before transporting your horse across state lines, check out the health require-
ments for transporting. Many large horse show and competitive venues may
require a current Coggins test prior to competition. Some venues even want
to see the paperwork before you can bring your horse on the grounds and
unload. You may be asked to produce current negative Coggins paperwork at
any time during any horse-related activity, so don’t leave home without it.
Prevention
You’d think that with all this testing, EIA would have been eradicated by now.
But unfortunately, that’s not the case. To help protect your horse from EIA,
follow these guidelines:
 Board your horse only at a facility that’s vigilant about requiring proof of
negative EIA status for all horses. (See Chapter 4 for more information
about boarding your horse safely.)
 Never use any needle syringe more than once, and be diligent that
equine professionals clean all instruments before using them on your horse.
 Make certain you know the EIA status of any horse you purchase.
Hitting the Respiratory System: 
Equine Influenza
Equine influenza is one of the most debilitating and highly contagious viral
respiratory diseases to affect horses. Equine influenza is transmitted from
horse to horse and through the air in particles that come from discharge
released from the horse’s nose. All horses can contract equine influenza, but
younger animals are most susceptible.
211
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

Symptoms
Equine influenza can cause a high fever, lethargy, and a nasal discharge that
starts out thin and clear, and can quickly develop into a thick copious discharge
(see Figure 12-1). Affected horses often develop a cough.
Dr. Janice Sojka, Purdue University
Uncomplicated cases clear up on their own within a week, although a persistent
cough may last several weeks. Complications and secondary infections can
lead to pneumonia and persistent poor performance, especially if the horse is
continually stressed and not allowed to recover completely.
Diagnosis and treatment
Veterinarians often diagnose equine influenza based on clinical symptoms. No
cure exists for this illness, but good supportive care — such as intravenous
fluids and drugs to control fever — can keep a horse from developing serious
complications. Sometimes your veterinarian may recommend antibiotic 
treatment to deal with a possible secondary bacterial infection.
Prevention
The best way to prevent equine influenza is to vaccinate. Although not foolproof,
the vaccine for this virus can go a long way toward keeping your horse from
contracting this illness. The number of times per year that you should vaccinate
depends on the amount of exposure your horse has to other horses as well
as her age. Your veterinarian can tell you how often you should vaccinate.

A Common Neurological Disease: Equine
Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM)
Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, or EPM, is caused by a protozoan called
Sarcocystis nerona and is the most commonly diagnosed neurological disease
in horses today. Many horses have been exposed to EPM, but not all horses
develop the disease. Younger and older horses are more commonly affected,
and horses who have never been exposed to the disease are more susceptible.
In horses who have already been exposed, stress is thought to play an 
important role in developing clinical signs of this disease.
The opossum is the host of this disease. Birds can carry this nasty little parasite
in their muscles. The opossums eat the birds and pass the organism out through
their stool. Horses then get the disease from eating food or water that’s 
contaminated with the opossum’s feces.
Symptoms
The EPM protozoa affects the spinal cord and brain, resulting in a variety of
symptoms, including incoordination of one or both rear limbs, stumbling, muscle
atrophy, and other subtle to severe neurological signs, such as bucking under
saddle, an inability to execute lead changes, and unequal stride length. Any
signs of brain and spinal cord problems can also signal EPM, from paralysis
to loss of bladder control and urine dribbling.
Diagnosis and treatment
At this time, the most definitive test for EPM requires examination of the
cerebrospinal fluid (drawn from a spinal tap) in conjunction with clinical
signs. Other tests are currently being developed.
Only a few approved products are on the market to treat this disease. The
success of treatment depends on the individual horse. Some horses recover
completely, while others retain some neurological damage for the rest of their
lives. Recurrence of the disease is also a possibility.
213
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

Prevention
A vaccine is available for EPM, but it’s somewhat controversial because it can
give a false positive on tests for EPM in horses who are suspected of having
the disease. Ask your veterinarian if this vaccine should be a regular part of
your horse’s protocol.
To help prevent EPM, keep water and feed sources clean and as free from
contamination as possible. Keep trash covered in secure containers to avoid
attracting opossums to your property. Remember though that any horse kept
outdoors anywhere can be exposed.
Beware of Ticks! Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is more common in people and dogs than in horses, but equine
veterinarians are seeing more cases in some areas — most frequently in the
Northeastern U.S. This tick-borne disease affects different areas of the body.
Ticks that are infected with an organism called Borrelia burgdorferi spread
the disease to horses through their bite.
Symptoms
The symptoms of Lyme disease may include a stiff gait, shifting-leg lameness,
fever, swollen joints, lethargy, and unwillingness to work. Incidents of equine
recurrent uveitis (a chronic eye disease) and neurological problems have
also been reported with Lyme disease.
Diagnosis and treatment
Lyme disease is tricky to diagnose because current tests can only indicate
whether your horse has been exposed to the causative organism, not whether
the horse has an active infection.
Because of the difficulty of this test, Lyme disease is usually diagnosed based
on clinical signs and after other diseases with similar symptoms have been
ruled out.
Treatment for Lyme disease is a regime of tetracycline, possibly given orally
and by injection. In some cases, the disease is never completely eradicated
from the body.
214
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Prevention
As yet, no vaccine for Lyme disease is available. The best prevention is to
keep your horse as tick-free as possible by keeping him stabled indoors if
Lyme disease is a problem in your area; you can find out by asking your vet-
erinarian. Groom your horse every day as well, keeping an eye out for embed-
ded ticks; we provide details on ridding your horse of pests in Chapter 4.
A Fatal Neurological Disease: Rabies
Nearly everyone has heard of rabies, but most people don’t know that horses
can contract this disease. Rabies, which is alive and well all around the U.S.,
is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system. It’s transmitted through
the bite of an infected animal. When an open wound comes into contact with
infected saliva, the virus gains entry into the body. Just about any type of wild
mammal can transmit the disease to a horse, including a coyote, bat, or raccoon.
Symptoms
Infected horses may show classic symptoms such as hypersalivation, seizures,
and other neurological problems, but they can just as often experience
lethargy, colic, lameness, muscle twitching, or even abortion.
Diagnosis and treatment
The symptoms of rabies are similar to other neurological diseases, such as EPM
(which we discuss earlier in this chapter), the equine encephalitis diseases 
(discussed earlier), equine herpes virus (also discussed earlier), and tetanus
(which we discuss later in this chapter), so this disease can be hard to diagnose.
In most cases, ruling out other possibilities is the best way to determine
whether rabies is the culprit in a horse who’s showing neurological symptoms.
(A horse who’s suspected of having rabies must be quarantined.)
No treatment exists for rabies in horses. The disease is almost always fatal,
and can be definitely diagnosed only with a necropsy (an animal autopsy).
215
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

Prevention
To minimize the possibility of your horse contracting rabies, avoid attracting
wildlife to your property by keeping trash containers well secured and keeping
grain stores under tight control. But the best way to protect your horse against
rabies is to vaccinate her. Talk to your veterinarian about the possibility of
adding rabies to your vaccination program. Although rabies may be a relatively
infrequent occurrence, the disease’s frequency is increasing. Vaccination is a
small price to pay for huge peace of mind.
A Nasty Bacterial Disease: Strangles
Strangles sounds nasty, and it is. Caused by the Streptococcus equi bacterium,
this disease affects the lymph nodes. Strangles commonly occurs in younger
horses between the ages of four months and five years. Older horses seem to
be less susceptible, probably because their immune systems are more 
developed.
Strangles is transmitted from horse to horse, either by direct or indirect con-
tact. A horse with strangles can contaminate a drinking trough, exposing all
other horses who drink from that same trough. Horses can also pick up the
disease from contaminated stalls.
The strep bug is a tenacious fellow! The bacterium can survive cold tempera-
tures. In fact, freezing preserves it. It can live for three to four weeks in water
that’s been contaminated by nasal discharge. It can also live on wood, glass,
and other surfaces for weeks.
Symptoms
Strangles causes fever, lethargy, and a thin, watery nasal discharge that even-
tually becomes very thick, and usually yellow. Horses usually start showing
signs of the disease 7 to 12 days after exposure.
As strangles progresses, it often causes swelling at the throat area, where
lymph nodes are situated between the jawbone and throat area. Affected horses
may develop a harsh cough or noisy respiration, and a large abscess may form
in the lymph nodes and then break open, draining the thick, ugly pus. Most
horses recover, but some develop secondary infections or complications.
Approximately 15 to 20 percent of horses experience complications of strep
infection, such as laryngeal inflammation and paralysis, and chronic infection
of the guttural pouches (see Figure 12-2). These horses carry and shed the
strep bacteria and may have recurrent episodes of coughing and nasal dis-
216
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

charge. Other horses just carry the bacteria and aren’t sick themselves, but
can infect other horses.
Dr. Janice Sojka, Purdue University
Horses can also experience two very serious complications of strangles.
 One is purpura hemorrhagica, an immune system problem that causes
severe inflammation of the blood vessels. Signs include swelling of the
legs and hemorrhages on the gums and mucous membranes, and it may
occur about three to four weeks after the initial infection.
 The other serious complication is “bastard” strangles, where the strep
bug goes to the lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, or any other lymph node,
and causes abscesses in the tissues of these areas. If these abscesses
enlarge and rupture, the resulting infection and inflammation can be life-
threatening.
Diagnosis and treatment
If your vet suspects that your horse has a guttural pouch infection, he or she
will use an endoscope to view the guttural pouches, take a culture by doing a
swab, and flush the pouches with antibiotics.
Treatment is supportive with isolated stall rest. The disease will run its course
if the infection is mild. Severe cases with high fever and severe respiratory
impairment from the abscess may require antibiotics, and even tracheostomy
(a hole is cut in the trachea and a tube is inserted so that the horse can breathe
through it). Vets disagree about how to treat the disease in its early stages,
however. Using antibiotics as soon as the disease is diagnosed can prevent
the formation of abscess, but prevent the horse from building a stronger
Figure 12-2:

case of
strangles

pouch.
217
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

immunity. This may result in a re-infection of the bacteria that remains in the
environment. Coauthor Dr. Kate prefers to let the abscess form and rupture
before giving antibiotics if necessary. (If the abscess doesn’t open on its own,
a veterinarian may have to lance and drain it.)
The serious complication of purpura hemorrhagica requires an aggressive
approach and is considered a veterinary emergency. Treatment can include
antibiotics, steroids to quiet the immune over-response, diuretics, leg wraps
if necessary, and hydrotherapy, possibly in a hospital.
Prevention
Try to prevent strangles by isolating all new horses who come to your facility
for at least two weeks.
Before you vaccinate your horse, ask your vet whether he or she recommends
doing so based on your horse’s level of exposure. Although vaccination may
not prevent the disease completely, it may lessen the severity.
Never vaccinate a horse who is already showing signs of the disease, or any
horse who has had strangles within the previous 12 months. These horses
already have a high antibody concentration, and a vaccine could cause the
horse to develop purpura hemorrhagica. If you have any question at all, ask
your vet if taking a blood sample to check for a vaccine titer, or possibly a
nasal culture, is in order.
You’d think that with modern science, strangles could be eradicated, but even
the cleanest, best-run facilities have strangles outbreaks. Part of the problem
is that even though vaccines are available, and horses who have had strangles
infections develop some immunity, this resistance diminishes over time.
A Lockup of the Muscles: Tetanus
Tetanus, also called “lockjaw,” is a serious and scary disease — and horses
are particularly prone to it. Tetanus infection is caused by a toxin produced
by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. This bacterium is commonly found in the
intestinal tract of animals, and the spores can live in the soil for years. That
means that it can be found everywhere in your horse’s environment. Horses
are also the most susceptible of all domestic animals to the tetanus toxin.
So how is tetanus transmitted? Horses are known for their predilection for
injuries, even in the safest environment. Cuts and puncture wounds allow the
bacterium to enter the tissues. Here, the bacterium releases its potent toxin.
These toxins affect the neurotransmitters in the horse’s spinal cord and
brain, and the animal develops muscle spasms and can’t relax.
218
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Symptoms
The symptoms of tetanus include a stiff gait, muscle spasms, and protrusion
of the third eyelid. Affected horses often jump violently when touched.
Diagnosis and treatment
A tetanus diagnosis is based on observing the horse’s symptoms. Depending
upon the severity of clinical signs when the horse develops symptoms, treatment
focuses on locating and treating the wound, neutralizing residual toxin by
administering an antitoxin, and providing nutritional and airway support if
the horse’s respiratory system is affected. Medication is also given to control
muscle spasms.
Sadly, even with all possible intervention, tetanus in unvaccinated horses is
always a very guarded to poor prognosis.
Prevention
Tetanus vaccine is one of the safest and most effective of equine vaccines.
Every horse should be vaccinated against this disease.
Horses who are fortunate enough to recover from tetanus don’t acquire
future immunity and still require the vaccine yearly.
Attacking the Brain: West Nile Virus
West Nile virus has gotten a lot of press lately. The disease usually has serious
effects on only two mammals: humans and horses. It attacks the body, infecting
the brain and nervous system.
The virus was first detected in the U.S. in 1999 in Connecticut, and has since
spread throughout the country. It can be an especially devastating disease,
with up to 30 percent of infected horses dying or requiring euthanasia from
complications of the disease. Of the survivors, approximately 17 percent
have permanent neurological deficits.
Horses contract West Nile virus after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
Birds are the main host of the disease. Mosquitoes bite infected birds, and
then bite horses, transmitting the infection to them.
219
Chapter 12: Fighting Infectious Diseases

Symptoms
Horses infected with West Nile virus may experience either mild or severe
neurological symptoms, including
 Lack of muscle coordination, stumbling, and weak limbs
 Partial paralysis
 Muscle twitching (especially around the muzzle)
 Hypersensitivity to sight or sound
 Head drooping
 Lethargy
 Falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as while eating
Symptoms usually appear seven to ten days after the horse is infected. Some
horses also run a fever when they first start showing signs of the disease.
Diagnosis and treatment
Veterinarians diagnose West Nile virus by testing the horse’s blood serum for
antibodies against the virus. No cure exists, so treatment involves supportive
care, such as intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatory drugs, to help the
horse’s body battle the effects of the organism.
Though not all horses who are bitten by an infected mosquito develop the
disease, after a horse begins to show neurological problems, the prognosis
for recovery is guarded.
Prevention
Regular vaccination is the best way to protect against West Nile virus. Most
veterinarians recommend vaccinating twice a year for optimum protection.
Vaccination protocol may depend on the climate and epidemiological status
of the disease in different parts of the country.
Discourage mosquitoes from breeding on your property by getting rid of
standing water and by adding mosquitofish to large water troughs and ponds.

Staying Prepared with 
Equine First Aid
In This Chapter
 Putting together the right tools and information
 Handling an injured horse
 Administering first aid to your horse
 Recognizing an emergency situation
H
orses have an amazing ability to hurt themselves. Maybe it’s because
they’re such big creatures who are kept in relatively small confines. Or
perhaps they’re just naturally clumsy. (Coauthor Audrey recalls the story of a
draft horse filly who once fell into her water trough and got her legs caught in
a fence, all at the same time.) Whatever the reason, horses seem to get 
themselves in situations requiring first aid on a regular basis.
In this chapter, we show you how to prepare for a first-aid emergency. We
give you instructions on how to deal with a variety of injuries and situations
until your veterinarian arrives to save the day.
Gathering the Right Tools and
Information for Emergencies
To effectively handle any equine emergency that may arise, you need to be
prepared. That means you have to think ahead of time about how you might
respond when your horse is in need, and you need to have the tools ready to
do what’s needed.
Before you do a thing, your first step in being prepared is having your horse
vet’s emergency number on hand and easy to find. Post it on your tack room
door, put the number in your cellphone, and leave it for your horse sitter if
you go away for the weekend. If you don’t have your own trailer, have the phone
number of an equine ambulance or friend with a trailer close at hand, too.

Staying aware of your horse’s health
A big part of providing first aid for your horse is knowing when it’s necessary.
Discovering as much as you can about equine health will give you the knowledge
you need to determine when your horse is in trouble and needs your help.
The following steps can help you develop a good working knowledge of horse
health and prepare you for potential emergency situations:
 Explore equine anatomy. Memorizing the parts of the horse, where the
major organs are located, and how the horse’s body works will give you
a solid background in how a healthy horse functions. (Chapter 10 is a
great place to start.)
 Know your horse. Watch your horse when he’s feeling well so that you
can tell if something isn’t right. Observant owners are usually the best
judges of whether a horse is experiencing a health problem. (Chapter 2
lists the signs of a healthy horse.)
 Find out about equine health problems. Study up on the types of prob-
lems that can affect horses so that you’re better able to recognize a
health issue when it comes up. (Flip to Chapters 11 and 12 for a primer.)
If you become a knowledgeable horse owner in these areas, your veterinarian
will love you for it.
222
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 
Making the medicine go down
Unfortunately, horses aren’t always cooperative
when you try to give them their medicine. But
we do have some tips and tricks that you can try
to make this job easier.
If you’re giving your horse a pill to swallow, dis-
guise it. Grind it up and mix it with grain, apple-
sauce, syrup, or even cake frosting. Experiment
to see what works for your horse. (Never try to
give your horse a pill without grinding it up first;
he’ll just spit it out.)
This trick also works with powdered medica-
tions. Some powdered medications are easily
disguised in food. Others are bitter and require
experimenting with added flavors. Powdered
gelatin mix or a strawberry-flavored soft drink
mix (like Kool-Aid) can often disguise unpleas-
ant tasting powders.
To help your horse take liquid medicine, ask
your vet about mixing it with pancake syrup or
molasses in a syringe and depressing the
syringe directly into the horse’s mouth. If the
medication is flavored, your vet may suggest
that you mix it with some grain or pelleted feed.
Paste medications need to be administered
directly into your horse’s mouth. Depending on
your horse, this will be either an easy task or a
difficult one. Some horses let you put a syringe
inside the corner of their mouths and allow you
to inject the paste right in. Others fight you like
a tiger to keep you from getting a syringe inside
their mouths. If you have a horse who hates get-
ting paste medicines, talk to your vet about 
getting the medication in an alternate form.

Assembling a first-aid kit
You can buy a complete first-aid kit at a tack store or through the Internet. Or
you can put together your own by using a lunch pail or fishing tackle box.
Keep the kit in your tack room or in your trailer if you travel with your horse.
If you like to trail ride, consider putting together a small first-aid kit to take
with you. The kit should fit in a saddle bag.
Include the following items in your kit:
 Antibiotic ointment: Triple antibiotic ointments are great for applying to
minor wounds for protection against infection.
 Antiseptic cleanser: Chlorhexidine scrub is a good choice when it
comes to an antiseptic cleaner for wounds.
 Bandages: Vet wrap bandages are good for applying pressure to leg
wounds. They’re available in tack stores, on the Internet, or through
mail-order catalogs.
 Cotton sheets or quilted wraps: Sheets of cotton measuring 30 x 36
inches are good for wrapping injured legs.
 Duct tape: A roll of duct tape is useful in wrapping a hoof after a puncture
wound.
 Gauze pads: Sterile, nonstick gauze pads are great for dressing small
wounds, abscesses, and other breaks in the skin. They come in a variety
of sizes.
 Hand sanitizer: If you can’t find water to wash your hands, use a hand
sanitizer before handling a wound.
 Latex gloves: These are handy if you have to handle an open wound on
your horse.
 Lubricant: K-Y Jelly or another personal lubricant is good to have on
hand for lubricating a rectal thermometer. (Petroleum jelly is not a good
choice because it can irritate the lining of the rectum.)
 Pocket knife: A knife with a serrated edge sharp enough to cut is good
to have because horses sometimes get tangled in ropes, wires, and their
own tack.
 Rectal thermometer: A veterinary or human rectal thermometer is an
absolute necessity. Knowing your horse’s temperature before calling the
vet helps give the doctor a better idea of what’s wrong. (See Chapter 2
for instructions on taking your horse’s temperature.)
 Rubbing alcohol: Rubbing alcohol is valuable as a disinfectant for rectal
thermometers.
 Scissors: Scissors can be used for cutting bandages and cloths in an
emergency.
223
Chapter 13: Staying Prepared with Equine First Aid

 Tweezers: A splinter or cactus spine can be removed with a pair of
tweezers.
 Wound medication: A wide variety of wound medications are available
for use in a first-aid kit. These products help protect the wound, discour-
age flies from landing, soothe the skin, and promote healing. Ask your
veterinarian for a recommendation.
Keep your first-aid kit up to date by replacing ointments, cleansers, alcohol,
and lubricants every two years.
Considering the possibility 
of natural disasters
Unfortunately, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires
have become all too common and have forced most communities to have
evacuation strategies not only for people, but for animals as well. In the fol-
lowing sections, we explain the importance of planning for natural disasters
and obtaining identification for your equine friend.
Making plans
Take the time to make a plan for any disaster that may strike your home, and
know how to act on it if the time ever comes. The following points can help
you evacuate and care for your horse in a disaster:
 Have a halter and lead rope available for every horse and have quick
access to them.
 Plan a barn evacuation strategy in the event of fire. Your local fire
department will be happy to help you devise a safety plan. You should
also have a fire extinguisher in every barn and trailer, and be certain
that each is in good working condition.
 Line up a ride for your horse well before a disaster strikes. If you don’t
have your own trailer, know who you’ll call if you need to get your horse
out of the area in a hurry.
 Don’t wait until the last minute to evacuate your horses. Getting a horse
out of danger quickly is usually very difficult. Heed voluntary evacuation
warnings so that you’ll have enough time to move your horse.
Securing permanent and temporary identification
Natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and even earth-
quakes can create situations where horses either escape from their enclo-
sures or are deliberately turned loose in an effort to save their lives. Other
224
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

horses are taken from their stalls or pastures by rescue workers and hauled
to safety. If you’re absent at the time of the rescue, you may have no way of
knowing where your horse ends up.
You can mark your horse in permanent ways so that if disaster strikes, you’re
more likely to get your horse back. Here are some permanent ways to identify
your horse:
 Freeze brand: A common and effective method of horse identification,
freeze branding consists of a cold iron applied to the horse’s neck. The
freezing destroys the cells in the skin that produce color in the hair. 
The hair grows back white in the shape of the brand. (If your horse is white
or gray, the hair doesn’t grow back because the brand is held on longer,
leaving an area of gray skin in the shape of the brand.) The brand provides
a permanent mark that you record with a freeze-branding registry. Call your
local brand inspector for a list of approved freeze branders in your area.
(You can find brand inspectors by contacting your county extension agent.)
 ID certificate: Identification certificates for horses are available through
some state agricultural offices. The identification certificate features line
drawings with your horse’s markings, brands, scars, and other identifying
factors drawn in. The vet filling out the paperwork gives a written
description of the horse and files the certificate with the state.
 Lip tattoo: If your horse is retired off the racetrack, he already has a lip
tattoo. Or a veterinarian can put one on the inside of your horse’s upper
lip. Some people like this form of identification best because it can’t be
seen unless you lift up the horse’s lip.
Before you go this route, check with your horse’s breed registry (if you
have one) to make sure that their rules allow you to have your horse’s lip
tattooed. (Be aware that lip tattoos tend to fade and become unreadable.)
 Microchip: An electronic identification microchip is placed into a ligament
in your horse’s neck by a veterinarian. This tiny computer chip contains a
unique number that corresponds to your contact information. This infor-
mation is maintained electronically by a microchip-registering company.
You can’t see the chip, and it doesn’t cause the horse any discomfort.
Even if your horse has permanent identification of some kind, adding a tem-
porary ID is a good idea if you’re preparing to evacuate because of an emer-
gency. Rescuers will be looking for temporary identification on horses who
have been separated from their owners, and this type of ID is easier to see.
Here are some ways to identify your horse to help ensure that you get him
back when the crisis is over:
 Fetlock ID bands: These bands attach to your horse’s fetlock area and
should contain your name, address, and a phone number where you can
be reached during the emergency. (You can order these bands via the
Internet.)
225
Chapter 13: Staying Prepared with Equine First Aid

 Hair ID: Using clippers, shave your phone number into your horse’s
neck. You can also use a permanent marker for this if you don’t have
clippers available.
 Halter tag: Sold in tack stores and through equine catalogs, halter tags
attach to the side of the halter. They’re engraved with one or two lines —
usually the owner’s phone number and address. You can also use a luggage
tag with your contact information and attach it to your horse’s halter.
 Photographs and record of identifying marks: Take color photographs
of your horse with you, along with notes on any identifying features
such as scars, brands, markings, cowlicks, and anything else that sets
your horse apart. Make sure that the photos show your horse from both
sides and from the front and rear.
 Tail ID: A luggage tag with your name, phone number, and address and
your horse’s information can be attached to your horse’s tail.
Braid the tag into the tail. Don’t tie it to the dock of the tail because this
can cut off circulation.
Approaching an Injured Horse
Few things are as scary as an injured horse. Horses are big animals, and their
injuries are often dramatic. Injured horses are often scared and in great pain.
They’re sometimes panicky, too, especially if they’re unable to get up or move.
To keep yourself and your horse safe during an injury emergency, you need
to know the best way to approach and handle the horse. You can do a lot to
help an injured horse, but you have to do it carefully or both you and the
horse can suffer serious consequences.
One of the best things that coauthor Dr. Kate ever learned about emergency
medicine was that in the event of an emergency, the first thing you do is take
your own pulse. Why? It causes you to take a deep breath and gives you a
moment to calm yourself. If you can’t take your own pulse, or if your pulse is
racing out of control, you won’t do the horse much good.
Keep the following points in mind if you ever encounter an injured horse:
 Stay calm. It can be hard not to panic when you see a horse injured,
especially if the horse is panicking too. But getting hysterical is the worst
thing that you can do. Horses feed off your emotions, and if you stay calm,
the horse is more likely to relax and allow herself to be helped. (By the
way, Dr. Kate says that staying calm is easier for a vet because it’s not the
vet’s horse experiencing the emergency.)
226
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

 Call for help. If you’re alone, calm the horse down by staying calm and
reassuring her, and then call for help right away. Ask someone to do that
for you if you’re with other people. You should call an equine veterinar-
ian or even 911 if a horse is trapped and injured.
 Put human safety first. If a person also has been injured or if someone
gets hurt trying to help an injured horse, help the person first before
you attend to the horse.
 Wash your hands. If you need to handle a wound, wash your hands, use
hand sanitizer, or put on latex gloves to prevent infection. (We explain
how to handle wounds later in this chapter.)
Applying First Aid
Giving first aid to your horse depends on the situation. Do a bit of studying up
on how to handle each of the following problems so that when an emergency
hits, you’re ready.
Wounds
Wounds come in several different types, and as you find out in the following
sections, you need to handle each one differently when you administer first aid.
If your horse is bleeding freely from an open wound of any variety, try not to
panic. Have someone call the vet while you apply first aid. Here’s how:
1. Assess the situation.
If you understand the type of bleeding that you’re seeing, you can accu-
rately gauge the seriousness of the situation.
• If blood is spurting from your horse, your horse probably has sev-
ered an artery. In this case, take immediate action to stop the flow
of blood.
• On the other hand, if the blood is dark and oozing, it’s coming from
a vein. You should try to stop the bleeding, but this kind of blood
loss usually isn’t life threatening.
2. Quiet the horse.
You need a cooperative patient if you’re going to stop the bleeding. Talk
to your horse and ask him to stand in one place because movement will
make the bleeding worse. Keep everyone around you calm because hys-
terics will only upset the horse.

3. Apply pressure.
Put pressure on the wound to help stop the flow of blood. Do this by
wrapping a bandage around the source of the blood flow. If you can’t do
this because the affected area is too large to bandage, put a piece of
gauze or another clean, absorbent material against it and press firmly. If
you don’t have a bandage or other material to press against the wound
and the blood seems to be coming from an artery, use your bare hand to
apply pressure to the wound. (Wear a latex glove if you can to avoid
infecting the wound.)
4. Add a tourniquet.
If you’re dealing with a severed artery in the leg and applying pressure
doesn’t help stop the spurting of blood, make a tourniquet out of a clean
towel or piece of cloth. Do this by wrapping the cloth around the leg
above the wound (between the heart and the point of bleeding). Tighten
the tourniquet and tie it until the blood flow stops. While waiting for a
vet to arrive, loosen the tourniquet every 15 minutes for a few minutes
at a time to allow blood to temporarily flow back into the leg.
Many wounds tend to happen on the legs. Know how to properly and safely
wrap legs before you tackle this situation (Figure 13-1 shows a properly
wrapped wound). If you wrap too loose, the bandage slips and can potentially
slow down the blood supply. Wrap the leg too tight and your well-intentioned
wrap could cause a bowed tendon. Ask your veterinarian to show you how to
wrap a leg so that if your horse ever injures himself, you’re prepared. (When
coauthor Dr. Kate was in vet school, the students had to put bandages on
each other’s legs and wear them for several hours while attending classes. It
was a great lesson, as you can imagine.)

Abrasions
Abrasions are superficial wounds that usually result when a horse scrapes
himself on something with a rough or jagged surface. Poorly fitting tack can
also cause abrasions.
These types of wounds aren’t dangerous in and of themselves unless they’re
particularly large and/or deep and become infected. You can prevent infec-
tion by handling an abrasion properly as soon as you discover the wound.
If your horse gets an abrasion that isn’t too deep or large, you can handle it
yourself with the following steps:
1. If the abrasion is bleeding profusely, stop the blood by following the
steps we give earlier in this chapter.
2. Cleanse the area with chlorhexidine scrub and apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Don’t bandage the area.
You want the area to be exposed to the air to help ward off infection.
Lower-leg abrasions are an exception; they can benefit from bandaging
to prevent fly infestations.
4. If the area becomes swollen, contact your veterinarian.
Flies can feed and lay their eggs in a wound, so be sure to keep these pests away
from any open sores on your horse’s body. You can buy special wound cream
that contains fly repellent at your local tack store or on the Internet. See
Chapter 4 for more information about getting rid of pests.
Lacerations
If your horse cuts himself, he’s suffering from a laceration. Lacerations can be
shallow or deep, depending on their severity.
Take the following steps if your horse has a laceration:
1. Flush the wound with water from a garden hose to get rid of foreign
material like dirt or rocks.
2. If foreign material clings stubbornly to the site, use chlorhexidine
scrub on a sponge to clean it gently.
3. If the wound is bleeding, apply pressure to stem the flow of blood
(just follow the steps we give earlier in this chapter).
4. If the laceration is shallow, apply antibiotic ointment to the wound —
don’t bandage it — and let it heal on its own.
If the laceration is deep (you can tell because deep lacerations bleed pro-
fusely and appear to go deep into the skin), don’t apply ointment. Instead,
contact your veterinarian right away.
229
Chapter 13: Staying Prepared with Equine First Aid

Punctures
Puncture wounds are serious because they provide an avenue for bacteria to
enter deep into the body. Nails and other sharp objects are the most frequent
culprits for puncture wounds.
If your horse suffers a puncture wound, follow these steps for first aid:
1. If the object is still embedded in the horse, remove it carefully and
keep it; if it’s embedded very deeply, have your veterinarian remove
it.
2. If the puncture wound is on the bottom of the hoof, mark the area of
the wound with a pen so that the vet can find it.
3. Don’t try to stop the bleeding.
The flow of blood helps wash out the bacteria.
4. Call a veterinarian right away.
The danger of serious infection is real with a puncture wound, so you need a
vet to come out and examine the wound. (Chapter 12 covers infections and
their consequences in more detail.)
Fractures
Fractures are terrifying and serious injuries in a horse. The way that you
handle first aid with a fracture can mean the difference between life and
death for your horse.
When a horse fractures a bone — usually a leg — the initial injury is only part
of the problem. As the horse struggles to stand or walk, further injury occurs.
If your horse fractures a bone, follow these steps:
1. Have someone call a veterinarian immediately.
2. Immobilize the fracture site by keeping the horse as quiet as possible
and keeping him from moving.
You can do this by staying calm, reassuring your horse with a soothing
voice, and asking him not to move by saying “whoa.”
3. If a wound is present along with the fracture, control the bleeding by
putting pressure on the area.
Clean the wound with water and bandage it to prevent contamination
with bacteria. (Do this only if you can keep the horse quiet.)
4. Don’t attempt to transport the horse before a veterinarian arrives to
splint the broken bone.
230
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Poisoning
Unlike dogs and cats, horses don’t routinely get into poisonous household
cleansers and antifreeze. They can still eat toxic substances, however, usually
in the form of plants growing along the trail or in the pasture. (See the nearby
sidebar “Problem plants” for a long list of threats.)
You may not know that your horse has eaten a toxic plant until he starts to
exhibit the symptoms of poisoning. The symptoms depend on the type of
toxin ingested. Some common poisoning symptoms include
 Colic (this ailment is explained in Chapter 11)
 Neurological symptoms like staggering
 Refusal to eat or drink
 Diarrhea
 Lethargy
 Poor coat and body condition that worsens over time
 Abortion of foal
 Profuse sweating
The symptoms of poisoning are similar to many other illnesses, so your vet-
erinarian will need to determine the cause if your horse is exhibiting any of
these behaviors or conditions. If you see one or more of the noted symptoms,
call your vet immediately; treatment depends on the type of poisoning that
has occurred.
Bites
Horses live outdoors and sometimes come into contact with other animals.
These meetings can result in a horse being bitten. The consequences of a bite
depend on the type of animal and the seriousness of the bite, as you find out
in the following sections. If your horse is bitten, take steps immediately to
deal with the situation.
Spiders
Two species of spiders can cause painful and serious bites in horses: the
black widow and the brown recluse. If your horse is bitten by one of these
spiders, you’ll probably see a wound that starts as a dime-sized lump and
gradually grows larger as the hair falls out. The spot is sore to the touch, and
your horse may even start rubbing it on fence posts or the walls of his stall.
Eventually, the lump opens up and a thick greenish pus begins to ooze out.
231
Chapter 13: Staying Prepared with Equine First Aid

If you discover a bite wound on your horse, follow these steps to provide him
with relief:
1. Call your veterinarian.
You need a vet to treat the bite, which has become infected. Your vet
may administer antivenin (if the wound isn’t too old) and/or antibiotics,
and may perform minor surgery to remove damaged tissue.
232
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 
Problem plants
As a horse owner, you need to know the most
common poisonous plants in your area. Watch
out for these plants in your pasture or along the
trail. If your horse eats one of these, contact
your veterinarian right away:
 Arrowgrass
 Asters
 Azalea
 Black locust
 Black walnut
 Boxwood
 Broomweed
 Buckwheat
 Buttercup
 Castor bean
 Clover
 Cotton
 Fern palm
 Fescue
 Fitweed
 Ground ivy
 Hemlock
 Horse chestnut
 Hydrangea
 Indian paintbrush
 Lantana
 Larkspur
 Locoweed
 Lupine
 Mesquite
 Milkweed
 Mistletoe
 Mountain laurel
 Oak
 Oleander
 Onions
 Rape
 Red maple
 Rhododendron
 Snakewood
 Squirreltail grass
 Tobacco
 Wild cherry
 Yew

2. Don’t let your horse rub the bite.
While waiting for your vet, keep your horse from rubbing the area by
tying him in a place where he can’t rub.
3. Remove food from your horse’s reach (providing him with water is
okay).
Take your horse’s food away from him in case your vet needs to give him
a sedative or anesthetic for the surgery.
Where one spider lurks, many others can be found. Search out black widows
and brown recluses in dark corners. Get rid of clutter where these spiders
can hide.
Snakes
Most snakes found in the U.S. are harmless. That said, you do have about 25
poisonous species to worry about. The most common of these is the pit
viper. Species in this family are the rattlesnake, cottonmouth or water moc-
casin, and copperhead. Each can deliver a bite that can make a horse very
sick. It’s a good idea to find out what each of these reptiles looks like so that
you recognize them if you see them on the trail. (The easiest way to know
what these critters look like is to do a simple Internet search.)
If you happen to run across one of these snakes, go around it, giving it plenty
of room. These snakes usually coil as a warning before they strike, and rattlers
shake their noisy tails. If you happen to see a viper in this position and you
can’t pass at least 30 feet from it, turn your horse around and go the other
way. The snake will probably leave the trail after you’re gone, and you can go
back several minutes later to see if it returned to the brush.
If your horse accidentally steps on one of these snakes or gets bitten on the face
by one because he lowered his nose to investigate, follow these tips and try not
to panic. Most snake bites aren’t fatal, although they can cause lameness,
swelling, and plenty of discomfort.
 Try to keep your horse from moving. The more he moves, the faster
the venom will circulate through his body. (This is if the snake injected
venom in its bite — not all bites contain venom.)
 Call for help, either with a cellphone or by sending another rider
ahead. If you’re alone and don’t have a phone (or can’t get cell service),
tie your horse to a tree and go get help. If this isn’t feasible, slowly hand-
walk your horse to get help.
 If you trail ride frequently in an area where pit vipers are common,
consider carrying two 5- to 6-inch long pieces of garden hose in your
saddle pack. If your horse is bitten in the face, inserting the hose pieces
into his nostrils will keep them from swelling shut.
233
Chapter 13: Staying Prepared with Equine First Aid

 Don’t put a tourniquet above the bite, cut the wound, or try to suck
out the venom. These methods are old wives’ tales that will do more
harm than good.
Other animals
Your horse may tangle with just about any kind of animal when out in a pasture,
but the most common altercations are with other horses. If your horse is bitten
severely by another horse, let the wound heal on its own with just an applica-
tion of antibiotic ointment. Keep flies out of it as it heals with a combination
wound cream/fly repellent. Make certain that your horse is up to date on his
tetanus vaccine because the wound can become contaminated with the tetanus
organism that’s widespread in the horse’s environment. (See Chapter 12 for
more information about tetanus.)
If your horse is bitten by another type of animal, like a dog, cat, coyote, or
raccoon, call your veterinarian immediately. These types of bites are prone to
infection, and antibiotics may be warranted.
Choking
When a horse chokes, it’s not the same as when a person or even a dog or cat
chokes. Food doesn’t block the horse’s airway — instead it blocks his esopha-
gus and makes him unable to swallow.
You can tell that your horse is choking if he coughs and salivates with his head
down while watery food comes out of his nose and mouth. He may also back
away from his food, act anxious, and/or swallow repeatedly.
If your horse is choking, call the vet right away. Food trapped in the esophagus
can cause irritation that often results in scarring and permanent damage or
may actually rupture the wall of the esophagus. The scarring causes the
esophagus to narrow, which means that the horse is more prone to choking
in the future. While you’re waiting for the vet, don’t allow your horse to have
access to any food or water.
Burns
It’s rare for a horse to experience a burn, but it sometimes happens. Horses
can be singed in a barn or brush fire, accidentally electrocute themselves, or
get a very bad sunburn.
 If your horse receives a burn from an open flame or from an electrical
wire, contact your vet immediately. While waiting for the vet to arrive,
run cool water over the burned area.
234
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

 Sunburn is the most common type of burn seen in horses and tends to
happen more often to horses with pink skin. The muzzle and nose are
most prone to this, although horses with pink skin on their backs can
also get sunburned. A sunburned horse can benefit from an application
of aloe, which helps soothe the skin. It’s best to protect your horse before
he becomes sunburned. A thick, zinc oxide ointment can shield the area
and prevent it from burning. Some people simply use a strong sunscreen
lotion to keep the sun from burning sensitive skin. Ask your veterinarian
to recommend a sunscreen suitable for use on horses.
Another option is to keep your horse indoors during the day. Or you can
fit your horse with a sun-blocking fly mask. If your horse has a pink
muzzle that tends to burn, purchase a mask that extends down the nose
and covers the delicate area.
Heat stroke
When horses work hard in hot weather, they’re prone to heat stroke — especially
if they’re unfit for the task that they’re performing. Heat stroke occurs when a
horse is unable to cool his body temperature because of increased exercise
and hot, usually humid weather.
If you see any of the following symptoms in your horse, he may be suffering
from heat stroke:
 Sweating stops: Even though the horse is exerting himself, he stops
sweating.
 Heavy breathing: Your horse is breathing more heavily than usual at
rest and may even try to breathe through his mouth.
 Fatigue: Your horse becomes tired and has trouble continuing with his
exercise.
 Stumbling: Just walking is difficult for a horse with heat stroke, and the
horse begins to stumble.
If you notice any of these signs in your horse, stop all activity and contact a
veterinarian immediately. While you’re waiting, work on getting the horse’s body
temperature back to normal by pouring cool water on his body, especially
around the head and neck and on the inside of the legs. By cooling the blood
flowing though these areas, you can bring down the overall body tempera-
ture. Try to move the horse into the shade too.
If your horse is diagnosed with heat stroke, give him a couple of weeks of rest
before asking him to work again.
235
Chapter 13: Staying Prepared with Equine First Aid

Knowing When to Call 
the Vet Immediately
If something is wrong with your horse, should you automatically call the vet?
That depends on what the problem is. You can handle some issues yourself,
or at least provide first aid before the vet comes.
Some situations are serious, though, and require an immediate call to the vet.
If your horse has one or more of these symptoms, call your vet for help:
 Bleeding: If your horse has significant bleeding, apply pressure to stop
the flow as we describe in the earlier section “Wounds.” Then call the vet.
 Bloody urine: If blood comes out when your horse urinates, she may
have an infection or bladder injury.
 Choking: If your horse coughs and salivates with her head down, and
watery food comes out of her nose and mouth, and she acts anxious,
swallows repeatedly, and/or backs away from her food, she may be
choking. (We discuss choking in more detail earlier in this chapter.)
 Colic: Signs of colic may include profuse sweating, repeatedly lying
down and getting up, pawing, standing with her legs outstretched,
rolling, and/or biting at the abdomen. Take away the horse’s food and
hand-walk the horse until the vet arrives. (For more information on
colic, see Chapter 11.)
 Diarrhea: Severe, liquid, foul-smelling diarrhea is an emergency.
 Difficulty breathing: Horses who are breathing rapidly, coughing repeat-
edly, or have noisy, raspy breath need to be seen by a veterinarian.
 Fever: If your horse’s temperature is significantly above 101.5 degrees
Fahrenheit (38.6 degrees Celsius) or below 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7
degrees Celsius), call your veterinarian right away. (We explain how to
take your horse’s temperature in Chapter 2.)
 Inability to stand: Staggering, falling, or not being able to get up signals
an equine emergency.
236
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

 Injury: Deep wounds that expose the bone are emergencies, as are 
puncture wounds. Infected wounds also demand a call to the vet.
 Irritated eye: If one or both of your horse’s eyes becomes teary or is held
partially or completely closed, contact your vet. Other signs of serious
eye problems include the white part of the eye turning red, sensitivity to
light, a cloudy surface, or the inability to see in the dark. (See Chapter 11
for the basics on eye problems.)
 Pain: A horse showing pain in any part of her body should be seen by a vet.
 Refusal to eat: This is a serious sign of illness.
 Straining: Straining to defecate or urinate with little or no result may
indicate a serious intestinal or urethral blockage.
 Swelling: Swelling in any part of the body requires a call to the vet.

Checking Out Complementary 
and Alternative Therapies
In This Chapter
 Discovering different types of nontraditional therapies
 Finding out how to choose a practitioner
You’ve no doubt heard about alternative therapies in relation to human
health. Well, many of these same therapies are available for horses too.
Really!
Alternative medicine is called alternative medicine because that’s just what it
is: an alternative to conventional medicine. In recent years, different types of
alternative therapies have grown in popularity, both in human and veterinary
medicine. That’s because, in many cases, they work.
Your authors believe that alternative therapies work well when used in con-
junction with conventional medicine or in place of traditional therapies when
these therapies haven’t proven helpful. In a nutshell, we want you to understand
and hopefully embrace alternative medicine but still rely on conventional veteri-
nary medicine, too. We use many of these therapies on our own horses, and
coauthor Dr. Kate practices them. So you’re in good hands in this chapter! Here
we explain the different types of alternative medicines available to horses and
what kind of problems these therapies can address. We also show you how to
find a trustworthy practitioner. You’ll know a thing or two about what you can do
in addition to conventional veterinary medicine after you finish this chapter.
Working with your primary-care veterinarian as a veterinary healthcare team
will help your horse get the best integrative and comprehensive care. Your
veterinarian should remain your horse’s primary care provider and provide
all conventional (or Western) medical and surgical needs and diagnostics
that your horse may need.

240
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 
Understanding Which Treatments 
May Help Your Horse
Alternative medicine comes in a variety of treatments. Although scientific
studies have shown some of these therapies to be useful, the success of
others is based on anecdotal evidence. In the following sections, take a look
at the different types of alternative therapies available for horses to get an
idea of what’s out there.
No one therapy can cure every disease or condition, but some of the therapies
in the following sections can surely help. They can work to complement
traditional treatments or as a substitute for traditional practice.
 In the first case, alternative therapies can be used in conjunction with
traditional treatment. For example, a horse with a tendon injury can be
treated traditionally, and then acupuncture can be used to help the
horse heal faster.
 In the latter case, we recommend that you go this route only if you try
traditional therapies and don’t find success with them.
Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese
Veterinary Medicine
Acupuncture is probably the most well-known alternative therapy. This ancient
Chinese practice has taken hold in the Western world, both in human and 
veterinary medicine, and with good reason: It works. Acupuncture goes hand
in hand with Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM), another
ancient practice.
In the narrowest sense, acupuncture is the application of small-gauge needles
to various points on the body in order to cause physiological responses in
the treatment of almost any disease or condition. It can be especially useful
for relieving pain.
In a broader sense, acupuncture is an ancient procedure used in TCVM for
the treatment of whole-body conditions. TCVM is an entire medical system
that also includes food therapy, herbal prescription medications, massage
therapy (known as tui-na; we discuss massage in more detail later in this
chapter), and addressing emotional/behavioral and environmental issues.
According to acupuncture theory, electrical life energy, or Qi (pronounced
chee), travels through the body in very specific pathways called meridians.
Acupuncture points act as valves along the pathways, which the acupuncturist
can manipulate with needles to change the energy flow, help balance that

energy, and promote a healing response. Horses’ bodies want to be healthy —
this natural inclination toward health is how you can fight or, better yet, pre-
vent disease. Western medicine has a more mechanistic view of health, reduc-
ing disease and illness to specific cellular and molecular systems.
If you’re wondering right now how your horse is going to feel about having
needles stuck in her, take heart. The needles are usually small enough that
horses experience minimal pain. However, the needle stimulation can cause
warmth, tingling, or numbness, which can be slightly discomforting to some
horses. Most don’t seem to notice the individual placement of needles during
their session. Many horses become very relaxed or sleepy and may continue
to sleep for hours after their treatment. Others may feel energized and may
have increased energy and activity. These responses signal neurological or
hormonal changes or pain relief brought about by the treatment.
Because TCVM (including its most common component, acupuncture) is an
entire preventative and therapeutic medical system in itself, you can use it as
a supportive or adjunct therapy for a vast number of diseases and problems
and not just for pain control. For example:
 Veterinarians have reported favorable acupuncture results in the treatment
of cardiovascular disorders, chronic respiratory conditions, skin disorders,
gastrointestinal problems, allergies, reproductive disorders, immune-
mediated problems, musculoskeletal diseases, neurological disorders,
and disc disease, as well as behavioral problems in horses.
 It also helps support the care and recovery of cancer patients, often
improving their quality of life during treatment.
 Emergency veterinarians may even use acupuncture to help stop or 
control seizures and to aid in cardiac CPR.
Using the other components of TCVM in addition to acupuncture can
increase your horse’s chances for health and recovery.
 Food therapy is very important and, as practiced in TCVM, very specific
for each individual patient. For example, an older horse showing a certain
pattern of disharmony in the body would be given more barley in his diet.
 Chinese herbal prescriptions are very specific prescription medications
used to treat disease imbalances. They aren’t over-the-counter substances.
 The practitioner may also teach you how to perform massage or 
acupressure procedures to help your horse at home.
241
Chapter 14: Checking Out Complementary and Alternative Therapies

Aromatherapy
Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of plant essences, or essential oils, for
healing. You can use aromatherapy alone, but many people commonly use it
in conjunction with massage therapy (which we discuss later in this chapter)
and other bodywork techniques. Aromatherapy is most commonly used to
calm and relax horses.
Some plant oils have inherent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and healing
properties. Other oils are used for their aromatic properties, which suppos-
edly affect healing and well-being. The essential oils used in aromatherapy
come from flowers, leaves, bark, and the fruit of plants. They usually have a
very strong scent.
Aromatherapy works like this: When the potent scent molecules from the
plant essences are inhaled into the body, they’re read by the limbic system of
the brain, which then triggers the endocrine system to release various neuro-
chemicals that cause varied responses in the body. For example, essential oil
of lavender seems to exert a calming effect on animals and people.
Aromatherapy is generally very safe, although some oils can render a horse
disqualified in a drug test for a competitive event. Camphor, menthol, and
thymol are absorbed systemically and can cause positive reactions in drug
tests. Some oils are also very irritating and can cause sensitivity reactions if
applied to the skin of some horses.
Flower essences, such as the popular Bach flower essences available in health
food stores, are distillates of flower blossoms or plants that are believed to
have powerful harmonizing effects on animals. They’re frequently used for
behavioral, emotional, and stress-related issues. One of the most common
Bach flower essences is Rescue Remedy, which some horse owners feel helps
to alleviate anxiety in their horse during situations such as trailering and
weaning. In fact, some competitors not only give Rescue Remedy to their horse
prior to competition, but also take it themselves to help calm preshow jitters.
Chiropractic
You’ve no doubt heard of chiropractic for humans. Believe it not, chiropractic
is used quite a bit on horses too. Chiropractic is the use of manipulation of the
spine, joints, and specific anatomic regions of the body to cause a therapeutic
response. It uses controlled forces applied to these areas to improve neuro-
logical and physical function.
242
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

The theory behind chiropractic is that spinal and joint dysfunction can affect
the normal physiological function and balance in healthy horses. The health
of the spine and all associated structures — including the vertebrae, nerves,
blood vessels, muscles, and ligaments — is involved. Chiropractic care is an
excellent therapy to help horses heal from injuries that often involve sec-
ondary compensatory problems; these problems result when one part of the
body is injured or weak and another part becomes overworked or injured
trying to compensate.
Veterinary chiropractors perform adjustments to the spine and joints to correct
any improper alignment and restore normal range of motion, and thus restore
health and relieve pain. Most horses don’t seem to mind chiropractic adjust-
ments. Some even seem to enjoy them. A good chiropractor will take care
with a horse’s painful areas, using gentle techniques to reduce pain before
making an adjustment to the horse’s spine.
You can find chiropractors without veterinary degrees, but coauthor Dr. Kate
recommends that you use only veterinary chiropractors for your horse because
their veterinary knowledge is key in properly assessing your horse’s healthcare
issues. They also know when chiropractic care is the best option for your horse
or whether you should use conventional care and diagnostics. We give you the
scoop on finding trustworthy practitioners later in this chapter.
Homeopathy
Homeopathy is a healing system developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late
1700s in Germany. In this form of healing, extremely diluted forms of particu-
lar substances are given to a patient to promote healing. Some of these sub-
stances include arnica montana, chamomilla, and nux vomica.
Proponents of homeopathy say that this therapy treats the patient, not the
disease. Each horse is diagnosed and treated on a specific, individual basis.
For example, two horses with a similar diagnosis of degenerative joint dis-
ease would both be treated conventionally with a drug called bute and possi-
bly other drugs or procedures. But with homeopathy, the veterinarian would
consider the individual differences in each horse’s underlying disease
processes, and he or she would treat each horse differently.
Homeopathic practitioners look to restore the balanced state of the patient’s
vital force. Hahnemann’s theory is that disease manifests when there’s a d
isruption of that vital force. When the integrity of the vital force is restored,
so is the animal’s health, and the disease is cured. Hahnemann believed in
thoroughly assessing all aspects of a patient’s health issues for clues to 
determine the disruption of the vital force and prescribe a specific remedy.
243
Chapter 14: Checking Out Complementary and Alternative Therapies

You can dilute homeopathic remedies to a strength of only 1:10,000. Although
such a dilution contains an almost imperceptible amount of the original 
substance, homeopaths maintain that shaking the solution appropriately
between dilutions to add energy has a positive effect on a patient. The exact
dilution of the remedy is also determined by the individual patient.
Horses can drink the remedy if it’s added to their water, or they may eat the
remedy in solid form after it’s mixed with some grain.
If you want to treat your horse with this type of therapy, seek out a qualified,
experienced veterinarian who’s trained and certified in veterinary homeopathy.
(We explain how to find a practitioner later in this chapter.)
Laser therapy
If you (or your horse) have had any surgery within the last five to ten years,
the surgeon probably used a surgical laser to expedite the procedure and
cause less trauma. You probably had a faster and less painful surgery and a
quicker recovery, thanks to the laser.
Although surgical lasers are extremely high-powered, using low-powered
lasers to reduce tissue swelling and shorten healing time for numerous soft-
tissue problems and injuries is becoming common. These low-light lasers are
believed to help healing by utilizing electromagnetic radiation that’s trans-
formed into amplified light beams. These beams can penetrate the skin and
some muscle tissue and may stimulate the release of neurotransmitters,
which in turn can enhance cellular functions without producing heat.
The most common application for low-light laser therapy in horses is treating
tendon and ligament problems. Some practitioners use laser therapy to
manage the pain that comes from navicular syndrome and arthritis (see
Chapter 11 for more information on these ailments). It may also facilitate the
healing of wounds.
In addition, some acupuncturists use laser therapy to stimulate acupuncture
points that may be too difficult or dangerous to needle in a horse who won’t
stand still for treatment. (We discuss acupuncture in more detail earlier in
this chapter.)
By the way, the word laser is actually an acronym for Light Amplification by
Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Who knew!
244
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Magnetic therapy
You’ve undoubtedly seen folks at horse shows wearing those interesting
necklaces and bracelets made of magnets. Many people who wear them
swear that these magnets have pain reducing and healing powers. Proponents
claim that certain parts of the body respond positively to magnetic fields.
This notion has caught on to the point that every horse publication and
equine supply catalog has at least one advertisement for magnetic therapy
products. You can find these products for horses in hock wraps, blankets,
and even headbands. For humans, you can find jewelry, mattress pads, and
even socks.
Although most healing benefits of magnetic therapy are believed to be a result
of initiating cell membrane stabilization in tissue that has been disrupted,
some believe that magnets also reduce pain. Magnets help to stimulate hoof
growth and treat navicular problems, laminitis, and thrush. Magnetic leg wraps
supposedly speed healing, generate heat, and increase blood flow by rearrang-
ing the ions in the blood stream. They also treat tendon and bone problems.
However, many conventional scientists don’t believe these claims because no
double-blind studies have been conducted to prove them.
Electromagnetic therapy is the use of pulsating electromagnetic energy via
electrical current. In addition to the previously mentioned applications, 
veterinarians also use this form of magnetic therapy for fracture healing.
Massage therapy
Massage therapy comes in many different forms. It’s great for relaxing horses
and for increasing their circulation. It can also help ease muscle soreness and
stiffness. Massage therapy can be helpful after strenuous exercise to help
muscles get rid of waste products like lactic acid.
Massage therapy also facilitates bonding between owner and horse. People who
routinely massage their horses notice health problems with their animals early,
when treatment can be quicker, easier, and less expensive. Coauthor Dr. Kate
believes that all horse owners can benefit from studying even the most basic
massage techniques so that they can use them on a regular basis to enhance
their horse’s well-being.
You can use different types of strokes with various massage therapies, each
with specific applications. And massage can also include the use of liniments
and essential oils.

A popular type of massage for horses is equine sport massage therapy. Designed
to increase circulation, relax muscle spasms, relieve tension, enhance muscle
tone, and increase range of motion, this type of massage is most popular on
performance horses.
Another technique often categorized as massage is T.Touch. Developed by
horsewoman Linda Tellington-Jones, the technique involves circular move-
ments of the fingers and hands on various parts of the horse’s body.
The theory behind this technique is that cells in the body retain memory of
injury or pain. The movement to the skin applied through the T.Touch method
helps reset the body’s cellular memory, thus eliminating the pain or emotional
issue associated with that part of the body.
T.Touch is used for a variety of purposes, including muscle stiffness and sore-
ness, as well as pain in any part of the horse’s body. Behavior issues arising
from fear, anxiety, and lack of confidence can also be treated with this method.
Nutraceutical therapy
A nutraceutical (the word comes from a combination of nutrition and pharma-
ceutical) is a dietary supplement that supposedly has benefits that go beyond
nutrition effects but aren’t quite in the category of a drug. Although some would
classify nutraceuticals as alternative treatment, the use of these compounds
has grown so dramatically that you’d be hard-pressed to find a conventional
veterinary practice that doesn’t carry at least one of these products.
The good news about nutraceuticals is that they aren’t regulated as drugs, so
they’re easier to get. The bad news is that their effectiveness hasn’t been
conclusively proven. The claims and benefits are mostly anecdotal and theo-
retical. Plus, not all nutraceuticals are created equal; the difference in quality
of ingredients can vary because little standardization exists.
Horse owners have so many nutraceuticals to choose from that picking the
right one can make your head hurt. You see nutraceuticals in a wide range of
prices, along with an even wider range of ingredients. They can be found to
help manage a wide range of conditions, including allergies, arthritis, and
hoof problems.
On the market you can find some excellent nutraceuticals that coauthor Dr.
Kate has personally used through the years on her patients, and she believes
that these animals have benefited from them. But she also thinks that, in most
cases, your horse can get along fine without them if you have an excellent equine
healthcare program in place. Remember: Nothing will turn old Dobbin into
the next Secretariat.

Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

Nutritional therapy
Certain diseases can benefit from nutritional therapy, which is basically the use
of food to help control the disease process. Some examples of equine illnesses
that you can manage with nutritional therapy include hyperkalemic periodic
paralysis (HYPP), which is a genetic disease affecting the muscles; pituitary
pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), or Cushing’s disease, which is a metabolic
condition; equine metabolic syndrome (EMS); and insulin resistance (IR). (See
Chapter 11 for details on the last three ailments in this list.)
For example, in horses with HYPP, veterinarians instruct owners to give the
affected horses feeds that are low in potassium; examples include alfalfa, tim-
othy, Bermuda grass hays, beat pulp, and oats. In fact, owners can find pro-
prietary feeds made just for HYPP horses.
If your horse is diagnosed with an illness that you can manage with nutri-
tional therapy, your veterinarian will instruct you on how to best feed your
horse.
Physical therapy
Physical therapy comes in many different shapes and sizes. Everything from
craniosacral work (moving the spinal and cranial bones to treat the central
nervous system) to hyperbaric oxygen therapy to therapeutic ultrasound falls
under the heading of physical therapy. More traditional physical therapy focuses
on veterinary sports medicine and rehabilitation after surgery.
Some veterinary schools have started offering postdoctoral courses for 
rehabilitative physical therapy in response to the demand created by an
increase in equine surgeries and more intense equine competitions.
An example of one type of physical therapy is therapeutic ultrasound. (This
isn’t the same ultrasound that your vet uses to check for pregnancy or tendon
lesions — that’s diagnostic ultrasound.) This type of ultrasound is a form of
acoustic energy, and is used to increase the metabolic activity in the cell that
the sound wave passes through or near. Although topical application of heat
affects skin (like those chemical heat packs), deep-tissue ultrasound can 
penetrate as far as 5 centimeters into muscle tissue to aid in healing.
This form of ultrasound provides pain relief, softens calcium deposits, softens
or reduces scars, increases joint mobility, and can increase tendon elasticity.
For this reason, it’s a favorite form of physical therapy for some veterinarians.
Because deep-reaching ultrasound units can cause burns very deep in the
tissue, only therapists working under veterinary supervision should apply this
type of therapy. (See the next section for details on searching for a practitioner.)
247
Chapter 14: Checking Out Complementary and Alternative Therapies

Another type of physical therapy for horses involves mobilizing and stretching
the muscles that have become strained or inflexible. Stiffness and restriction
of muscle movement of different areas of the body can cause pain for a horse.
Physical therapy that focuses on increasing mobility works in part by causing
a reflex in a part of the horse’s body that allows whatever muscle has
become tense to automatically relax.
Physical therapists use their hands to gently trigger these reflexes. They can
also encourage the horse to stretch the muscles herself. If the horse has a
problem in her neck, for example, the therapist can get her to voluntarily
stretch her muscles by offering her a treat in a way that makes her move her
neck a certain way.
Qualified and skilled equine physical therapists can do wonders to help a
horse who’s suffering from pain related to muscle stiffness and soreness. If
you think that your horse may benefit from physical therapy, discuss with
your veterinarian the possibility of having her treated by a physical therapist.
Finding a Practitioner
When choosing an alternative or complementary therapy practitioner, you
should use the same degree of care that you use to select your regular veteri-
narian. (We detail how to find a vet in Chapter 4.)
You also need to make sure that the person you’re considering is truly qualified
to practice the type of alternative or complementary medicine that he or she
is advocating. The person should have completed extensive training in the
therapy and not be someone who just hung up a shingle. Also, be wary of a
practitioner — even a licensed veterinarian — who claims to practice a little
bit of many different types of therapies. The expression “jack of all trades,
master of none” comes to mind in this scenario.
To help you find a good practitioner, ask your regular veterinarian who he or
she would recommend — assuming your vet is open-minded to alternative
and complementary therapies. Ask the person you’re considering a lot of
questions about the particular therapy that you’re pursuing. Good questions
include the following:
 What are your training and credentials?
 How long have you been practicing this modality on horses?
 How many treatments will my horse need?
 What is the cost of this treatment?
 How long will my horse need to recover?
248
Part III: Recognizing and Treating Illnesses 

A good alternative or complementary practitioner will be honest in his or her
opinion about whether a certain therapy can help your horse. Run fast if
someone claims to be the next big thing or guarantees results.
Some types of alternative or complementary practitioners are certified by or
are official members of organizations in their relevant field. Certification or
membership helps to guarantee that the person has been trained in the chosen
technique. If you’re considering a veterinary chiropractor, a homeopath, or an
acupuncturist for your horse, verify that the practitioner is certified by or is
a member of his or her respective organization. (You can find contact informa-
tion for these organizations in the appendix.) Some states require licenses for
alternative practitioners. Contact the professional organization for the modality
that you’re considering to find out whether your state requires licensing.

O
ne of the great joys of horse ownership comes with breeding your own
foal. Determining which stallion to put with your mare can be a fun and
exciting activity. And caring for your pregnant horse can be very rewarding.
In this chapter, we give you a primer on horse breeding: how the equine repro-
ductive system works and how to provide the best care to your mare during
pregnancy and foaling. Because breeding your horse is a huge responsibility,
we encourage you to make sure that this is something you really want to get into.
Equine Reproduction 101
The equine reproductive system is truly incredible when you take a close
look at it. How a baby horse comes to be is just amazing. Studying the mechanics
of how it all works will help you understand this miraculous process.
The female horse’s system
When it comes to reproduction, mares have a lot in common with human
females. That’s because both are mammals and both usually give birth to
only one baby per pregnancy.
The mare’s reproductive organs are located inside the pelvic and abdominal
regions of her body. The external reproductive organs include the vulva and
the teats, the latter of which deliver milk to the foal. The internal organs

include the vagina, the cervix, the uterus, two uterine horns, two fallopian
tubes, and two ovaries. (Figure 15-1 shows the female reproductive system.)
When a mare breeds, semen enters the vagina, passes through the cervix, and
moves into the uterus. The stallion’s sperm make their way into the fallopian
tubes, where they make contact with a ripe egg that has been released from
one of the ovaries. This fertilized egg moves down through the fallopian tube
into the uterine horn, and then to the uterus, where it attaches to the uterine
wall. The embryo inside the egg develops into a fetus, and 11 months later the
mare gives birth to a foal. (We describe the development of a fetus in detail
later in this chapter.)
The male horse’s system
Just as mares have many reproductive similarities to human females, so stal-
lions are similar to human males.
The stallion’s reproductive organs include the external sheath, penis, and 
testicles. Inside the penis is the urethra. Sperm is manufactured inside the
stallion’s testis, located within the testicles, and then stored in the epididymis.
It’s released from the epididymis into the vas deferens. Seminal fluid is created

in the ampulla, which is part of the vas deferens. The seminal vesicles,
prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands make up the remainder of the acces-
sory sex glands of the stallion. They contribute the seminal plasma, gel por-
tion, proteins, and various enzymes that make up the remainder of the semen.
These components mix with the sperm, and at the moment of ejaculation, the
semen is transported through the urethra and out through the penis opening.
(Figure 15-2 shows the male reproductive system.)
The breeding process
In terms of the actual act of breeding, horses are just like most mammals. The
mares cycle at certain times of the year, are receptive to breeding when they’re
in season, and don’t conceive again until they birth their foals.
The particulars of horse breeding are different from those of many other
mammals — although rabbits also have a lot in common with horses in this
department. In the following sections, we take you on a tour of the finer
details of breeding season and cycles.

Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

The breeding season
Mares typically come into heat in the springtime and go in and out of estrus
(the time when mares are receptive to stallions) throughout the summertime.
In the fall, the cycles of estrus in many mares end until the following spring.
The equine breeding season is dependent upon the number of daylight hours,
which trigger the pineal gland to signal the hypothalamus (the pineal and
hypothalamus are glands in the brain) to begin the hormonal changes that
set a mare’s breeding cycle in motion. In nature, this is all well-planned in
order to have breeding and foaling occur during the best weather conditions,
primarily from May to July.
However, some people want their mares to foal early in the spring because
many breed registries officially consider all foals to be one year old on January
1st. To produce a foal shortly after that January date, they must breed the
mare in the prior February or March because she takes 11 months to gestate.
The folks put their mares under lights to simulate the longer days of spring and
bring the mares into estrus. (Some breeders also put the stallions under lights
at this time of year in hopes of increasing their sperm counts.)
Breeding cycles
Mares are seasonally polyestrous, which means that they have recurring
estrus cycles during the breeding season until they become pregnant. In gen-
eral, average mares have single estrus cycles that last from 21 to 23 days.
During that time, the mare is receptive to the stallion for 4 to 7 days. This is
called the period of estrus. During the remaining 14 to 15 days, she isn’t
receptive to the stallion.
256
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 
Equine PMS
Many mare owners are painfully aware when
their mare is cycling. Some mares never seem
to have problems when they cycle — they act
and perform like real ladies. Some mares, how-
ever, have pain in the back area where their
ovaries are located, and are stiff and sore. This
causes them to perform well below par. And
mares exhibit what has become known as
witchy mare syndrome. These cantankerous
females show behavioral issues ranging from
pinning their ears to kicking trailers apart.
For this reason, many mare owners elect to give
their mares hormones that shut down their
normal cycles. Although this sounds like a great
and simple solution, you need to know that
doing so can affect a mare’s reproductive capa-
bilities later on.
Before you elect to use any hormonal manipu-
lation on your mare’s estrus cycles, please collect
all the facts and get several opinions from dif-
ferent veterinarians. Hormones that affect your
mare’s cycles are potent and can have side
effects. Also, oral preparations must be handled
with extreme caution because they can have
adverse effects on humans.

Typically, mares ovulate 24 hours before the end of estrus. The average gestation
is about 340 days — or 11 months — with some degree of variation on either
side.
Possible reproductive problems
When left to their own devices, horses seem to reproduce rather efficiently.
Human interference can sometimes reduce the natural equine efficiency for
reproduction, and that’s when breeding problems arise. The following sections
list additional reproductive problems that humans can’t control.
Female problems
Mares can develop breeding problems for a number of reasons beyond the
control of their human handlers:
 Age: A mare’s fertility declines with age, and getting an older mare —
that is, one 18 or older — pregnant can be challenging. Senior mares may
begin to cycle later in the breeding season and cycle less frequently. The
mare’s aging eggs may not be as viable as a younger mare’s, either. Also,
an older mare’s uterus may not function as efficiently as that of a
younger mare.
As mares age, they may have anatomical changes that necessitate a
procedure called a Caslick’s. In this procedure, the vet sutures the vulva
two-thirds shut to keep the mare from contaminating her reproductive
tract with feces. (This measure may be necessary in some younger mares
who have a vulvar anatomy that predisposes them to uterine infections.)
 Scarring: Mares that have been bred numerous times can also experience
scarring of the reproductive tract. This scarring can challenge fertility,
as can multiple or large uterine cysts, which may affect implantation.
 Infection: Chronic uterine infections can also affect a mare’s fertility and
are one reason why mares should have cultures prior to breeding. A cul-
ture can reveal a uterine infection that needs treatment before breeding.
 Hormone imbalance: Mares can also develop hormonal problems. If a
mare has any metabolic imbalances, such as Cushing’s syndrome, she may
be less likely to become pregnant. Also, some mares don’t produce enough
progesterone — the hormone primarily responsible for maintaining 
pregnancy.
257
Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

Male problems
Stallions also have their issues with fertility, although they’re often not as
complex as the problems seen in mares:
 Age: Stallion fertility also declines with age. Sperm count diminishes,
and the sperm produced may be abnormal or less motile.
 Low sperm count: Not all stallions are created equal. Some stallions just
don’t produce as many sperm as others. Also, some stallion semen
doesn’t lend itself to artificial insemination because it doesn’t fare well
in the shipping or freezing processes.
 Low libido: Some stallions just aren’t in the mood. These boys usually
turn out to be stallions who haven’t spent much time around mares.
Research shows that stallions with low libido develop a stronger drive if
they’re more frequently exposed to the gentler sex.
Determining Whether You 
Should Breed Your Horse
Breeding sounds like great fun, and it can be. But it’s also a huge responsibility.
If you want to breed your horse so that you can have a cute baby around the
barn, you need to realize that you’re taking on a huge responsibility. And when
all is said and done, breeding is still a crapshoot. You can never know for sure
what you’re going to get. In the following sections, we explain the responsibili-
ties of bringing a foal into the world and the considerations you should think
about before breeding your mare. (We don’t discuss how to breed a stallion in
this book because only experts in breeding should be handling stallions for
this purpose.)
Before you bring another horse into the world, remember that many horses
end up unwanted and suffer sad fates, either at the slaughter house or living
out their lives in neglect. Unless you plan to keep the horse that you breed
forever, realize that you may be contributing to the unwanted horse population.
Understanding the responsibilities 
of having a foal in the family
Bringing another life into the world comes with a number of responsibilities,
especially if that life is equine. Here are some points to consider before
breeding your horse:
258
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

 Cost: Obviously, you’ll be feeding and caring for mama before, during,
and after breeding, and at least until you wean the baby. (Coauthor Dr.
Kate recommends weaning foals at five to six months.) Figure on your
mare’s regular healthcare and feeding costs, plus that of the baby when
he arrives. (Remember that mares need special vet care, so this will cost
you more than her normal routine care.)
Unless you own the stallion, you’ll also have to pay a stud fee for breeding
services. If you’ll be taking your mare to the stallion to be bred, plan on
the costs of boarding at the breeding facility, transportation of your mare
to the stallion, nonrefundable chute fees (the monitoring of your mare during
reproductive procedures), and other possible fees.
If you plan to sell your foal to make up for all these costs, be aware that
you may not be able to sell the foal! You may end up having to keep him.
As a wise old horseman once told Dr. Kate: “You’d better breed for 
something that you’d like to keep and ride, in case it doesn’t sell.”
 Time: Aside from the time it takes to breed your mare, you’ll also spend
time caring for her while she’s pregnant. When she gets close to foaling,
you need to monitor her closely. Before the day (or likely night) that she
foals, plan to spend many hours watching her — possibly for days or
weeks beforehand. (We describe foaling in detail later in this chapter.)
After the foal is born, you need time to care for the baby, get him started
on early training (see Chapter 16), and keep a close watch on him to
make sure that he’s healthy and getting along okay.
 Work: Foals are a lot of work. Cute as they are, they need attention and
training. If you want your baby to grow up to be a good, easy-to-handle
horse, you need work with him when he’s young. You can’t just ignore
him until he’s ready for a saddle. During his young, impressionable
months, he needs to learn all kinds of stuff to prepare him for adulthood.
As his first owner, your job is to teach him (or hire someone who can).
Judging the mare
Before breeding your mare, think about why you think she deserves to be a
mother. That’s right. It sounds cold, but not every mare deserves the right to
reproduce. Although you may think that she’s a nice horse, she objectively
needs to be more than that. She must be healthy, have a good disposition, and
be physically well put-together. Why? Because any flaws that she has have a
good chance of being passed along to her offspring. You won’t be doing the
horse world a service bringing another equine into the world who’s sickly,
difficult to handle, or so badly conformed that the poor horse can’t stay sound
with normal work.
Conformation is the way that your horse is put together; signs of good confor-
mation include legs with the correct angles and overall balance. Figure 15-3
shows a horse with good conformation.
259
Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

Dr. Colleen Brady, Purdue University
So look at your mare very critically. Is she healthy? Is she sound? Does she
have good conformation? Does she have a pleasant temperament?
If your mare is registered, ask yourself whether she has genetics desirable for
your breed. If you aren’t sure, get advice on this subject from a good judge
for your breed.
Judging the stallion
The mare is only half of the equation when making a foal. The stallion is a big
factor as well. You can find stallions by looking at ads in local equine publica-
tions, in breed magazines, and on the Internet.
Do a lot of homework before choosing a stallion. Study the stallion’s confor-
mation and show record, and ask a lot of questions about his disposition. Try
to see as many of his adult progeny as possible in order to discover any
genetic predisposition for health problems. Also, check out this horse’s off-
spring because some stallions (and mares) are incredibly prepotent — which
means almost all of their progeny look similar no matter the cross!
Next, consider the hypothetical product of your mare with this stallion. Be as
objective as possible.

Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

Try if at all possible to visit the stallion in person. You want to select a stud
that truly complements and enhances your mare, and compensates for any of
her faults. (And, yes, she does have them. All horses do.)
Surveying Different Breeding Methods
There’s more than one way to breed a horse! Seriously, you can put horses
together for breeding in a number of different ways. The way you ultimately
choose depends on your situation, and the stallion owner’s situation and
preferences. Take a look at each of the three most common types of breeding
methods.
Live cover
Live cover is when humans manage the actual breeding process — that is,
they carefully control the actions of the stallion and mare (see Figure 15-4).
This is how many horses are bred these days. Some breed registries don’t
register foals who are conceived in any other way. That’s because they want
witnesses that the stallion did actually impregnate the mare who gave birth
to the foal. Live cover is also cheaper than using artificial insemination.

261
Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

Stallions who participate in live cover breedings are trained to do so. They
learn to mount the mare when told to do so. Mares, on the other hand, aren’t
as well-trained at this task as stallions and often wear hobbles on their back
legs to make sure that they don’t kick and injure the stallion. They may also
be placed in breeding stocks so that they can’t move around too much.
Before the breeding can take place, a teaser stallion prepares the mare and
helps the handler determine whether the mare is receptive to breeding. This
stallion puts the mare in the mood through a barrier so that when the breeding
stallion is brought into the shed, she’s ready to receive him. Another preparatory
step to breeding is the washing of the private parts of both mare and stallion
to lessen the chance of infection during the mating process.
Only experienced breeding handlers should be involved in live covers. Both
stallions and mares can get out of control during this very exciting time, and
people can be seriously injured if they don’t know exactly what they’re doing.
Handling of the breeding is the responsibility of the stallion owner. Make cer-
tain that the stallion owner has an experienced person managing the breeding.
Pasture breeding
Probably the simplest and most natural way of putting two horses together is
pasture breeding. In this type of breeding, the mare is placed in a pasture
with the stallion during her regular reproductive cycle (see Figure 15-5). Here,
nature takes its course.
Pros and cons exist to this method. Here are the pros:
 Pasture breeding is probably the most effective way to get a foal. For
many mares who have trouble conceiving with live cover, pasture breeding
may do the trick. The reason is probably that some mares have a very
quiet estrus cycle and don’t exhibit many of the signs of a mare in heat
(squatting, urinating frequently). In a pasture setting, a good stallion
knows exactly when the mare is receptive to his overtures. He also has
more opportunities to breed with her.
 Pasture breeding can also be helpful to a maiden mare (one who has
never been bred). Sometimes, maiden mares are afraid of the stallion
and resist breeding. In pasture settings, they have time to get to know
the stallion, and that seems to make them more receptive to his advances.
The greatest downfall of pasture breeding is an increased chance for injury to
both mare and stallion. Some stallions are quite aggressive when they breed
and can viciously bite mares during the act of breeding. On the flip side, mares
can kick and injure stallions, especially if the stallion tries to mount her when
262
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

she isn’t in the receptive part of her cycle. The risk of infection to both horses
is greater with pasture breeding. Owners of very valuable stallions and mares
are usually reluctant to go the pasture-breeding route.
If you like the idea of pasture breeding your mare, you need to find a stallion
owner who uses this method.
Bob Langrish
Artificial insemination
The most common breeding practice among serious breeders, artificial
insemination, allows mares and stallions in different parts of the country to
come together to make a foal without ever actually meeting each other.
Artificial insemination requires collection of the stallion’s semen. This is done
by teasing a trained stallion with a mare who’s in estrus and then having him
mount a breeding dummy. The ejaculate is collected in an artificial vagina,
and the semen is processed so that it can be shipped to one or more mares
around the country for insemination (see Figure 15-6). Mares are inseminated
during their estrus cycle.

Testing for genetic problems 
before you breed your horse
Before you put your mare with a stallion, you
need to take some precautions to make sure
that your foal isn’t born with a genetic disease.
If the breeding stallion and mare are of certain
at-risk breeds, they should both be tested for
known genetic problems. Some of these condi-
tions include:
 Hereditary equine regional dermal asthe-
nia (HERDA): Other names for this condition
include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and der-
matosparaxis. This hideous disease, which
has been seen in Quarter Horses and
horses of Quarter Horse lineage, occurs
due to an inherited connective tissue disor-
der resulting in defective collagen forma-
tion. Horses with this illness have skin that’s
stretchy and not adequately attached,
allowing it to tear easily. These animals
suffer from the pain involved, secondary
skin infections, and disfiguring scars.
Because no cure exists, most animals are
euthanized.
 Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HYPP):
Also seen in Quarter Horses and those of
Quarter Horse lineage, this disorder tends
to be found in those horses bred for
extreme muscle development. HYPP is a
genetic disease that results in unpre-
dictable attacks that may vary from muscle
fasciculation or trembling to extreme weak-
ness with collapse and even death. Though
some of these animals can be managed
with diet and treatment, breeding of such
carriers is discouraged and homozygous
individuals born in 2007 or later are ineligi-
ble for Quarter Horse registration.
 Overo Lethal White Syndrome: Usually the
result of breeding two Paint horses who are
carriers of a particular color gene, this con-
dition results in early death of the foal.
 Glycogen branching enzyme deficiency
(GBED): Seen in Quarter Horses and
Quarter Horse related breeds, this disease
results in abortion, stillbirths, and foal
deaths.
 Severe 
combined 
immunodeficiency
(SCID): A genetic disease of Arabian
horses, SCID causes affected horses to
have inadequate immune response against
infectious diseases. Foals with this condi-
tion rarely live to the age of 6 months.
 Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB):
This disease is usually manifested by miss-
ing patches of skin and mucosa at birth. It
shows up in several draft horse breeds, as
well as Saddlebreds. This condition is also
called Epitheliogenesis Imperfecta, or EI.
Foals with this defect are usually eutha-
nized at birth.
By having your horse tested before breeding,
you can be sure not to pass these lethal genes
along to the next generation of foals. Talk to
your veterinarian about having your horse
screened.

Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse
Bob Langrish
Some stallions have semen that ships very well; others have semen that doesn’t.
Some breeders process semen for shipping by cooling it by a very strict
process. Other breeders may use a freezing process to preserve the semen
for breeding. Both processes have advantages and disadvantages. Costs and
equipment needs also differ.
Artificial insemination is more costly than live cover because it requires the
services of a veterinarian. It also costs money to ship the semen. The advan-
tages are that you can breed your mare to a stallion who’s on the other side
of the country without having to ship your horse. You also don’t have the risk
of mare or stallion being injured during the breeding process.
Not all breed registries allow the registration of foals who are the result of
artificial insemination. The Jockey Club, which registers Thoroughbreds,
doesn’t permit this type of breeding at the time of this writing.
If you want to use artificial insemination to breed your mare, talk to your vet
to make certain that he or she offers this service. Discuss the timing of the
insemination with your vet as well because the semen needs to inseminated
when the mare is in estrus.
The Skinny on Horse Pregnancy
On the day you breed your mare, you’ll be beside yourself with glee. This feel-
ing may soon be replaced by momentary panic when you realize that you have
a baby on the way and all the responsibility that comes with it. But have no
fear. You have almost a year to prepare for your new arrival. In the following
sections, we explain how to make sure that your horse really is pregnant,

describe the stages of equine pregnancy, and give you tips for prenatal care.
We also let you know the signs of a possible pregnancy problem.
Verifying that your horse is pregnant
First, you need to make sure your horse really is pregnant. Just because you
bred her doesn’t mean that she conceived.
To be sure that the breeding took, your vet uses either palpation by hand or a
combination of palpation with ultrasound to see whether your mare is pregnant
(see Figure 15-7). In most cases, this exam and ultrasound should take place
about 14 to 16 days after the breeding. Ultrasound exam at this stage helps to
rule in or out the possibility of twins. And the veterinarian can use the ultra-
sound exam to evaluate the ovaries, embryo, uterus, and cervix. If the vet
sees any hint of an abnormality, he or she may recommend additional tests
or medications.
Many equine veterinarians also recommend evaluating the pregnancy by
ultrasound around day 24. By this time, you can see the heartbeat, which
means that the embryo is alive. As a general rule, most mares should also be
checked for pregnancy at about day 40. If a mare loses her pregnancy after
about day 35, she’s unlikely to come into heat again for many months.
After pregnancy is verified, the mare can be released from the breeding facility.

Looking at the stages of pregnancy
At 40 days of pregnancy, the developing embryo is now mature enough to be
called a fetus, with limbs and organs. Throughout the coming days, the fetus
begins to slowly morph into a horse. Consider the following:
 At around 90 days, the baby has tiny ears and little hooves, but its size
is close to that of a hamster (see Figure 15-8).
 By 180 days, it looks a lot like a small horse and is the size of a beagle
(see Figure 15-9).
 At 10 months, the baby appears as it will at birth, complete with mane
and tail (see Figure 15-10). At this point, its front legs are already starting
to move into the birth canal.

Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse
What if your mare is pregnant with twins?
If having one foal is awesome, wouldn’t two be
double the fun? Actually, no. When it comes to
horses, twins aren’t a cause to celebrate.
The cold reality is that in 95 percent of the
cases, mares carrying twins abort the entire
pregnancy before the due date. Healthy twins
carried to term are very rare in the horse world.
When a veterinarian checks a mare 14 days into
her pregnancy, he or she may discover twins. In
most cases, mare owners opt to have one of the
twins eliminated to help ensure survival of the
second one. This procedure is done by a veteri-
narian, who ruptures the embryo.
Although eliminating one of the embryos is a
sad decision to make, it gives the other a fight-
ing chance to survive. But, sometimes, both
embryos can be lost when the attempt is made
to eliminate one of them. Where the embryos
are positioned in the uterus relative to each
other can make this task very difficult or impos-
sible. Sometimes aborting the entire pregnancy
and starting over is wiser.

As the foal is developing, the mare’s belly grows larger. Pretty soon, she
starts to look like she’s going to burst. That and the calendar tell you that
you’re near the end of her pregnancy.
Caring for the mom-to-be
As your mare’s baby is growing inside her, your job is to help her maintain a
healthy pregnancy. Here are some things to keep in mind when caring for
your mare:

Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

 Good weight: Make sure that the mare’s body condition is good; don’t
let her get too fat or thin. If she gets too fat, she’s predisposed to meta-
bolic syndrome or laminitis, each of which can cause her to lose her
foal. (See Chapter 11 for more information on these conditions.)
Conversely, if your mare becomes too thin, her pregnancy will be compro-
mised because her body may have to make a choice between sustaining
her health or that of the foal.
 A smart diet: Your pregnant mare is eating for two, so take that into
account when serving her meals. Discuss her diet with your veterinarian.
During the first two trimesters (the first six months), you don’t need to
change your mare’s ration, assuming that she’s in good health and body
condition and is neither fat nor thin. (Vitamin/mineral intake or supple-
mentation may be necessary for mares on pasture or forages only.)
In the last few months of pregnancy, the baby makes big demands on mama.
Her energy requirements, protein needs, and vitamin/mineral requirements
are likely to increase. She should already be eating 90 percent of her food as
roughage (mostly hay). Discuss increasing her daily protein intake 8 to 10
percent with your vet, and talk to him or her about increasing calcium,
phosphorus, copper, and zinc — these are the building blocks for the
foal’s healthy bones. (See Chapter 6 for details on high-protein feeds.)
 Preventative care: Follow the deworming program outlined for your mare
by your veterinarian; a worm infestation can threaten your mare’s preg-
nancy (see Chapter 4). And give your mare the recommended rhinopneu-
monitis vaccines during her pregnancy to prevent an abortion caused by
the equine herpes virus (see Chapter 12).
Be sure to use only vaccines provided by your veterinarian because you
need to use a special rhinopneumonitis vaccine for pregnant mares.
Also, ask your veterinarian about boostering your mare for immunity to
other diseases while she’s in late gestation. Vaccines at this time may
increase her antibody levels and thus provide greater protection to the foal.
 Low stress: Keep your mare’s stress to a minimum. You can still ride her
and give her light exercise to keep her fit, but coauthor Dr. Kate recom-
mends letting her be a happy pasture girl with pregnancy leave from
work from the sixth month of gestation until she weans her baby.
 Being careful: Never give your pregnant mare any medications or sup-
plements without consulting your veterinarian first. A healthy mare on a
good diet doesn’t need any special supplements or vitamins unless your
vet recommends them for a specific reason.
269
Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

Staying aware of possible 
pregnancy problems
Unfortunately, things can go wrong during a mare’s pregnancy. Signs of a pos-
sible problem with the pregnancy include vaginal discharge or dripping milk.
If you see either of these symptoms in your mare, call the vet right away. In
addition, if your mare becomes ill for any reason, goes off her feed, or acts
depressed, call your veterinarian immediately. Abortion is relatively rare, but
any time a pregnant mare seems ill, she should be seen by a vet.
Viral and bacterial infections can certainly cause abortion, and so can ingestion
of toxic plants, and certain drugs and chemicals. Diseases of the placenta and
umbilical torsion can also result in abortion.
Although this all sounds scary, chances are good that your mare will enjoy
her pregnancy without any problems at all.
Delivering a Baby Horse
Of course the most exciting moment in the entire breeding and pregnancy
process is the moment of birth. When your new little baby horse comes out
to meet the world, you’ll be moved beyond words.
You need to be ready for that big day and know what to expect; we tell you
what you need to know in the following sections. Being prepared helps you
stay calm and provide the best care for mama and baby.
Preparing a place for foaling
The place your mare foals depends on your facilities and your personal pref-
erences. She can foal out in a pasture, in a paddock, or in a cozy box stall.
Coauthor Dr. Kate likes to let her mares foal in a clean, grassy pasture by
themselves, even though she has 12-x-24-foot foaling stalls at her facility just
for this purpose. Her reasoning is that the foaling process can be quite an
athletic event, and she doesn’t want to risk her mares getting cast (stuck against
a wall) in the stall during delivery. So she puts her mares in a foaling pasture 30
days before their expected delivery date to give them time to become familiar
with their surroundings.
270
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

If you prefer to have your mare foal indoors, as many horse owners do, you
must provide her with a stall that’s at least 14 x 14 feet in size, although bigger
is better. The stall must have clean bedding, preferably straw because shavings,
sawdust, or sand can cling to the new, wet baby and the mare (see Figure
15-11) and result in umbilical cord infection. You should also keep the stall
scrupulously clean at all times.
Bob Langrish
Recognizing the signs of foaling
Toward the end of your mare’s pregnancy, she starts to show signs that she’s
ready to foal. The signs of eminent delivery are variable between mares, but
many give the following clues before giving birth:
 Two to four weeks before foaling, the udders fill up and appear swollen.
 Four to six days prior, the teats of the udders become distended.
 One to four days before, a waxy buildup shows on the nipples. Honey-
colored colostrum may also drip from the teats.
 When foaling is imminent, your mare’s udders may begin to drip milk.
You may also see changes in her behavior. She may start to act restless
or uncomfortable, and may even rub her tail on a wall or fence or start
to kick at her belly. She may pace or get up or down a lot. At this point, if
you’re really astute, you may notice that the muscles of your mare’s
croup soften and flatten and the vulva relax.
If your mare’s restless behavior lasts for more than a couple of hours with-
out producing a foal, call your veterinarian. She may be having a problem.

271
Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

Taking action just before foaling
Hopefully, before your baby is about to be born, your vet has given you a
video to watch that shows the foaling process. If you haven’t watched it yet,
now is the time!
As foaling time approaches, wash and clean your mare’s vulva and hindquarters;
you can also wrap her tail carefully with gauze to keep it clean and out of the
way as the foal comes out of the birth canal.
Make sure that you have your veterinarian’s phone number ready in case you
need him or her. (You should need your vet only if your mare starts having
problems, described later in this chapter.)
Watching the stages of foaling
As soon as your mare goes into labor, she begins the three stages of foaling.
Stay outside your mare’s stall or pasture and watch from afar as the miracle
unfolds:
 Stage one: Contractions begin in this stage and can last from one to two
hours. The mare’s uterine contractions push the baby through the cervix
and into the correct position in the birth canal. The mare gets up and
down several times and may roll during this stage. The fetal membranes,
called the allantoic sac, may be visible at the mare’s vulva. When the sac
breaks and fluid goes all over the place, stage one is over.
 Stage two: This is the actual expulsion of the foal. This process happens
extremely fast, so if it’s taking more than 30 minutes for your mare to
deliver her baby, call your vet right away.
When the foal is in normal delivery position, he looks like a diver going
off the high-dive as he comes out of the birth canal (see Figure 15-12).
 Stage three: During this stage, the placenta is expelled. Placentas should
be passed one to three hours after delivery.
Offering postpartum care
Your foal will be born with a sac known as the fetal membrane around him.
As he struggles after birth, he breaks the sac with his mom’s help. (If he
doesn’t, you should get involved by using a clean towel to clean membranes
272
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

and secretions off the nose and mouth.) After this breakage happens, check
to see whether the foal is breathing. Watch the foal’s flanks to see whether
they go up and down as he breathes.
Bob Langrish
The umbilical cord may have broken during delivery, or it may break when
the foal stands up. No need for you to cut it. In fact, doing so can be danger-
ous to the health of the baby. Instead, let it break on its own and then treat
the stump with whatever antibacterial solution your vet recommends.
You may feel the urge to get your hands all over the baby right away, but
coauthor Dr. Kate recommends letting the mare and foal rest for at least 30
minutes so that they can form a strong bond. (If you want to imprint your foal —
a method of early training in newborn horses — see Chapter 16 for details.)

Chapter 15: Breeding Your Horse

Keeping an eye out for possible problems
during and after foaling
Horses have been giving birth without the help of humans for millions of
years, so it’s likely that everything will go smoothly when your foal is born.
However, things can go wrong during the process. If you see any of these
problems unfolding, step in and intercede or call your veterinarian right away:
 Wrong position: If you notice the foal coming out in any other position
other than front feet first, call your vet right away. Other positions
include hind feet first, head but no feet, feet turned upward, or anything
other than feet first followed by the head, neck, torso, and hindquarters.
 Water doesn’t break: Before the mare can safely deliver the foal, her
water must break. If this doesn’t happen and you see a balloon of water
showing from her vulva, break it yourself with your fingers.
 Fetal membrane doesn’t break: If the foal has already been born and
the fetal membrane hasn’t broken, intercede and break it yourself. Start
at the foal’s nose to enable him to breathe. Clear his nasal passages of
the membrane by using a clean towel.
 Umbilical cord won’t break: Letting the cord break on its own is a good
idea, but if the placenta has passed and the cord is still attached to the
foal 20 minutes later, consult your veterinarian, and follow his or her
instructions.
 Retained placenta: If the placenta isn’t expelled within 1 to 3 hours, call
your vet. Retained placentas can be dangerous and can lead to laminitis
and serious uterine infections.
 Foal is unresponsive: If the foal has been born but isn’t moving, clear
the baby’s nostrils by sweeping your hand down the face from the eyes
across the nose. Move the baby around to see whether he stirs. If not,
call your vet immediately.
 Any other concerns: If something just doesn’t seem right to you, don’t
take a chance with the health of your mare and foal. Call your vet right
away. Being on the safe side is better than waiting, because your foal
could die if you don’t act quickly.

 Training your foal
J
oy of joys, your baby horse is here! And man, is she cute!
If you can stop staring at her long enough to read this chapter, you’ll find that
we give you a great start in figuring out how to care for your new infant equine.
You find out how to make sure that she’s healthy, how to keep from panicking
as you watch her try to stand up, and how to examine Mom to make sure that
everything is hunky-dory. You also discover how to provide healthcare and
good nutrition to the baby and how to get that baby started in her basic training.
Monitoring Mom and Baby after Delivery
Out on the open range, mares have their babies in the grass, away from the
safety of the herd. Their offspring stand quickly, nurse on their own, and
eventually make their way back to the other horses. So why do humans need
to get so involved with newborn baby horses? Can’t they make it on their
own without human intervention?
Well, chances are, they can. But out on the open range, not every foal makes
it because no one is there to help in case of a problem. And because you defi-
nitely want your foal to survive, you need to get involved to make sure that
she has the best chance possible. You also want to keep an eye on Mom to
make sure that she’s in good shape, too.

Watching the baby
As soon as your baby is born, you need to check her to make sure that she’s
healthy and doesn’t need veterinary intervention. In Chapter 15, we describe
several problems that can occur at the moment of birth. Review these conditions
to make certain that your foal has made it this far without a problem.
After the baby has been born, she should be bright and alert to her surroundings.
She should try to get up within 30 minutes after birth. Seeing your foal trying
to get her legs under her for the first time will make you want to laugh and cry
at the same time. It can be a big struggle for one so small and weak to get those
long, spindly legs in order. But a healthy foal tries to make it happen within
only half an hour of birth.
You may feel the urge to jump in and help your baby learn to stand and walk,
but try not to intercede. Your foal needs to do this on her own, and as long as
she has plenty of room in the stall — and plenty of soft bedding beneath her
feet — to stumble and fall over without getting hurt, she’ll be fine (see Figure
16-1). Have no fear while you watch — she’ll eventually figure it out.

When foals stand to nurse, they’re very adept at finding the udder. Again,
resist the urge to interfere and help. The mare and foal need to have time to
bond and adjust to one another without you being in the middle of it.
If your baby stands, but seems to be completely unable to find the udder after
about 10 minutes of searching, you can assist at this point by gently guiding
her to the udder location — put your arms around her neck at chest level and
around her buttocks as you help her walk in the direction she needs to go, as
shown in Figure 16-2. (If she struggles a lot and seems more interested in fighting
you than in looking for the teat, back off and let her find it on her own.)
If, despite your efforts to help and a lot of searching, the baby still can’t find
the udder, she may have a problem. Call your veterinarian.
If your foal doesn’t stand and nurse at all within two hours, call your veteri-
narian. The foal may be weak and need medical attention. Foals need to receive
colostrum (the mare’s first milk, which is high in protective antibodies) within 8
to 12 hours of birth, when their intestines are able to absorb it. Colostrum
provides the foal with passive immunity to prevent disease and provide
protection until her own immune system develops. If the baby is too weak to
nurse, you may have to milk the mare and give the foal milk and colostrum
through a stomach tube.

277
Chapter 16: Caring for the Newborn

Foals should pass a sticky, dark stool called meconium — which forms in their
intestines before birth — within the first 12 hours, after eating a meal or two.
If your foal doesn’t pass meconium, she needs an enema. Ask your vet to
show you how to do this procedure before your foal is born so that you’re
ready to perform this task if needed. (If you’re uncomfortable with the idea of
giving your new baby an enema, be prepared to call your veterinarian to
come out and do it for you.)
Examining the mare
Let your mare rest for about an hour after she gives birth. She’s tired and
needs a break. During this time, she bonds with her foal. (You’ll know the two
are bonding because the mare will lick the foal and clean her up, nuzzle her,
and maybe even nicker to her.)
After your mare rests for an hour, start taking her temperature every eight hours.
If her temperature goes much above normal — 101 degrees Fahrenheit — call
the vet. (See Chapter 2 for details on how to take a horse’s temperature.)
Your mare should be producing milk for her foal. You can probably see the
milk dripping from her udders. If not, give them a very gentle squeeze to see
whether milk comes out. (Be careful when you do this — most mares are fine
with it, but if this is your mare’s first foal or if she’s touchy about that area,
she may kick out. Put a halter on her and have someone hold her while you
squeeze the udder.) If no milk comes out, contact your vet immediately.
Without milk from her mother, the baby has nothing to eat.
If your mare seems okay within these first 24 hours — that is, she’s alert and
is eating, drinking, taking care of her foal, and passing urine and manure —
she’s probably fine. If anything seems amiss, including signs of distress or
lethargy, call your vet immediately.
278
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 
The signs of a good equine mom
You’d expect your mare to be delighted with her
new baby, and most mares are. She should be
curious but not aggressive toward her baby, and
she should begin to nuzzle and lick her. First-
time mothers may be frightened of their babies,
however, and may even reject them.
If your mare seems to be aggressive toward her
foal, put a halter on the mare, remove the baby,
and reintroduce the foal with the mare under
control. Let her slowly get used to the foal and
hope for her maternal instincts to kick in. If after
a couple of hours the mare still doesn’t accept
the foal, call your veterinarian. Your baby needs
to nurse and get much-needed colostrums from
the mare, and if the mare won’t let this happen,
you may need to milk the mare and bottle feed
the baby. Your veterinarian can help you with
this task.

Make an appointment with your veterinarian to perform a thorough exam on
mom and baby approximately 24 hours after the birth. The vet will check both
for any possible complications (see the next section for details).
When your mare passes her placenta (also known as the afterbirth), save it
all in a bucket so that your vet can examine it. Your vet needs to make sure
that the mare passed the entire placenta because retained placenta can cause
serious infection and laminitis.
Providing Healthcare and Good
Nutrition for Mom and Baby
If you managed to get through the birthing process without having to call your
vet, congratulations! Your job isn’t over, however. In the following sections,
we explain how to offer the best healthcare and nutrition to your new equine
friend and his mom.
Taking care of the first vet 
appointment after delivery
When your veterinarian comes 24 hours after the foal’s birth to check on the
mare and foal, he or she examines the placenta that you saved in a bucket
(see the earlier section “Examining the mare”) to ensure that the mare passed
the entire thing.
Your vet also performs a complete exam of the foal to be certain that everything
is progressing as it should. This is the perfect time to ask any additional ques-
tions that you may have about foal care, especially if this is your first foaling
adventure. Your vet can also check your foal for good antibody protection if
you request this test (and we recommend that you do). The foal should have
acquired antibodies from the mare’s colostrum (see the earlier section “Watching
the baby” for details). If not, the vet can administer plasma to the baby if 
necessary.
The vet then examines your mare to be certain that she isn’t having postpartum
complications. If she’s having trouble letting down her first milk, the vet may
give her an injection to encourage it. The vet may also want to deworm your
mare at this time to further decrease possible transfer of parasites to the baby,
even if you’ve kept up with a good deworming program all along (as we 
recommend in Chapter 4).
279
Chapter 16: Caring for the Newborn

Nursing and feeding
Your foal was born with the instinct to nurse and makes his way to the mare’s
udders not too long after standing. Newborn foals suckle an average of four
to six times per hour during the first week of life, drinking about 30 percent of
their body weight daily. During this time, they grow very fast, gaining one to
three pounds of weight each day!
Watch your foal suckle. He should be vigorous, and you should see him swal-
lowing. If you notice that milk comes out of his nose, or if feeding is accompanied
by coughing, call your vet right away. These problems indicate a possible
blockage in his esophagus.
As the foal ages, his nursing decreases to one to two times per hour. By the
time he’s about three to four weeks old, he starts to show an interest in solid
food. This stage is where managing his diet gets tricky. You don’t want your
foal to eat too much of certain foods because he can get developmental ortho-
pedic disease (DOD), which causes limb deformities. Grain and concentrated
feed aren’t good for your baby and may make him grow too fast, which brings
on DOD. (Some researches also believe feeding too many carbohydrates to a
young horse can encourage the habit of cribbing — see Chapter 3 for more
information on this vice.)
If your mare is getting these kinds of foods and allowing the baby to share
them, find another way to feed the foods to your mare so that your foal 
doesn’t have access to them. If your foal is still growing too fast, limit his
access to hay too, particularly alfalfa. Discuss your foal’s diet with your 
veterinarian so that you know you’re feeding him right.
Your mare should remain on the same diet she was eating during the latter
stages of her pregnancy. She can stay on this diet while she’s nursing her baby.
Talk to your vet to make sure that the mare is getting the diet she needs.
280
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 
Baby’s eating what?
Be prepared for this one: Your cute little foal is
probably going to horrify you by eating some of
his dam’s manure. Although that sounds yucky,
it’s actually normal and necessary behavior.
Called coprophagy, this eating of stool allows the
baby to get necessary bacteria into his gut and
acquire other nutrients.
Keep your foaling stall clean, especially of urine,
but allow some normal feces from the mare to
remain. Foals eat feces several times daily for the
first week of life, and usually cease altogether by
two to three months of age.

Recognizing and treating foal-specific
health problems
In the days after birth, foals can sometimes develop problems. Some of these
include:
 Infection: Foals can sometimes develop bacterial or viral infections
requiring immediate veterinary care.
 Parasites: Intestinal worms can make a foal sick.
 Gastroduodenal ulcers: Foals sometimes develop ulcers in their
intestines. Symptoms include grinding teeth, pain after eating, and
excessive salivation.
 Pneumonia: The cause of pneumonia can be bacterial, fungal, or viral. Foals
may develop pneumonia from accidentally breathing in milk while nursing
(if the baby was born with a cleft palate), or when nursing from a bucket or
bottle. Lack of cleanliness of the stall can also cause this condition.
 Polyarticular septic arthritis: A septic arthritis and joint infection usually
affects multiple joints. Foals with this condition have swollen and painful
joints, depression, poor appetite, and fever. This condition is usually the
result of a failure of passive antibody protection, uterine infection from the
mare, or poor hygiene during foaling, allowing infectious agents to enter the
foal’s body via the navel. This condition can have serious consequences
and can lead to chronic lameness and death if not treated. Vets use
aggressive supportive veterinary care and appropriate systemic 
antibiotics to treat septic arthritis.
When a young foal becomes sick, it’s serious business. Seriously ill foals usually
require IV fluid therapy, plasma transfusion, and antibiotics. If a foal is having
great difficulty breathing, the baby may need bronchodilators to open up his
air passages, as well as oxygen therapy. The foal may also need tube feeding
to keep his energy and protein intake at high levels.
When an older foal — anywhere from three to six months — gets sick, the
young horse is more likely to exhibit the kinds of respiratory symptoms seen
in adult horses, including coughing, raspy breathing, depression, fever, and
loss of appetite. This is the time in the foal’s life when maternal antibodies
are waning and the foal’s immune system is developing. During this period,
limit a foal’s exposure to strange horses who have been at shows or in other
places where large numbers of horses congregate. If you handle any horses
like this yourself, wash your hands well before handling your foal.
Keep a close eye on your foal so that you can monitor his health. Don’t hesi-
tate to call the vet if something isn’t right. If you see the following symptoms
in your foal, the time to act is now!

mean that the foal isn’t nursing)
 Struggle to defecate
 Inability to urinate
Training Your Baby Horse Early On
It’ll be years before you (or someone else) start riding your new horse. But
that doesn’t mean that you should wait several years before you start her
training. Teaching your young horse should begin early in her life. Setting a
strong foundation now makes your horse easier to train as she gets older.
Imprinting
Imprinting is a term used to describe a method of early training developed by
Robert Miller, DVM. The principle behind imprinting is that you teach the foal
that humans are part of her herd and that she’s subordinate to them. By
imprinting the foal and making this strong first impression, the foal becomes
easier to train in the future.
Imprinting has become a controversial subject in the horse world. Some
people believe that imprinting creates a pushy horse who doesn’t respect
humans. Others believe that it’s too invasive and interferes with the bond
between a mare and her foal.
Other people find that, if done right, imprinting creates a calm, malleable horse
who’s easy to train and handle. According to Dr. Miller, the key to successful
imprinting is to do it right. Badly done imprinting is worse than none at all.
If you choose to imprint your foal, study this method carefully long before
your baby even hits the ground. Videotapes — available from equine catalogs
and Web sites — give you detailed step-by-step advice on how to perform
this training method.
282
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

Before you begin imprinting, allow the mare and foal to bond. After you get
the sense that the two have made that connection, you can proceed with the
imprinting. Bonding usually reveals itself by the baby and mother interacting
with each other.
You should imprint over three separate sessions. Conduct each session as
follows:
 Session one: Performed immediately after the foal is born, this step con-
sists of placing a halter on the foal; bending the foal’s head and holding
it to teach yielding; rubbing the foal all over with a towel; handling the
foal’s legs and tapping the hooves; placing a finger in the foal’s ears, nos-
trils, mouth, and anus; and rubbing the foal with different objects, such
as clippers, a white plastic bag, and a newspaper. These steps help to
teach the foal to submit to human handling.
During the session, the foal may struggle in an effort to get away from
the stimuli. The key to successful imprinting is to continue the stimuli
until the foal relaxes. This crucial point is where many handlers go wrong.
If you stop the stimuli while the foal is struggling, you teach her to resist
you.
 Session two: This session takes place after the foal is standing and has
nursed for the first time, and it lasts about 15 minutes. The objective is
to desensitize the foal’s back where the saddle will sit, as well as the girth
area. The foal also learns to be sensitized in certain areas of her body,
like the flanks, and to back up in response to chest pressure, to move
forward in response to butt pressure, and to turn on the forehand and
hindquarters with pressure. The session also consists of follow-up
desensitization of areas covered in the first session.
 Session three: Designed to further sensitize the foal in certain areas of
her body, you perform this session when the foal is 12 to 36 hours old,
depending on the foal. (The baby needs to be strong on her feet and well-
coordinated for this session.) First, halter the foal and repeat all the desensi-
tizing steps from sessions one and two. Then add a leading lesson (see
the section “Lead training” for more information).
Now that you know the basics of imprinting, we want you to know that you
can overdo imprinting and take it to the extreme. Coauthor Dr. Kate believes
that mare and foal must have time alone together early on in order to form a
strong bond. This period is especially critical for a maiden mare and her first
baby, when foal rejection is a possibility. Don’t let imprinting interfere with
your mare’s ability to bond with her foal. Keep sessions short and don’t keep
your mare away from her baby.
283
Chapter 16: Caring for the Newborn

Additional handling
Whether you choose to imprint your foal or not, it’s a good idea to continue
to handle her a lot during her young weeks and months. Dr. Kate uses a spe-
cific method that works well for her foals.
At about a month of age, Dr. Kate brings her mares and foals in from pasture
and puts them in stalls for four or five days so that the babies can get a
refresher course on handling. The babies get lots of pats and scratches from
people and get their feet picked up, their ears played with, and both sides of
their bodies rubbed.
Dr. Kate starts putting halters on her babies at this stage, but she doesn’t
leave them on for safety reasons. (The halter could get caught on something
out in the pasture, including another foal; see the next section for more about
halter training.)
Because Dr. Kate’s broodmares come to the edge of the pasture daily to get
petted (they love attention), the babies come with them and get additional
handling, too. They get their feet handled and their bodies and faces touched.
At this point, she also starts teaching the babies how to give when light pressure

Mom and baby: A real team
Mother horses are among the most protective
and doting of all domestic animal species. And
baby horses are among the most devoted off-
spring. The two are deeply bonded. Keep this fact
in mind when you’re handling them, and check
out these pointers for dealing with mom and baby
as a team:
 If you want the baby to move, you have to
move mama first. The foal takes her cues
from mom, and if mom isn’t going in that
direction, neither is baby.
 Mom won’t leave her baby, no matter what.
She can be the best-trained horse in the
world, but if the baby isn’t coming along,
mom isn’t going either. (And no human is big
or strong enough to make it happen.)
 Mom has only one thing on her mind:
Protecting and staying close to her baby.
She has no qualms about risking her own
life to save her foal. Remember this before
doing anything with the baby that mom may
perceive as threatening. If the baby acts
scared or upset, mom may very well jump in
to protect her.
 Baby will always go to mom for comfort. In
fact, if the baby gets scared or nervous, she
runs to mom’s udder and puts her nose near
it. The smell of the udder means safety and
security to the baby. (You can help the baby
feel more comfortable with you by adding
this smell to your hands by handling your
mare’s udders.)

is applied to their bodies — an important lesson for them to learn now so that
they’re easier to train when they get older. Dr. Kate asks them to back up by
putting pressure on the chest. She also asks them to sidepass (move sideways)
by applying light pressure to their sides.
Dr. Kate follows all early training with immediate praise. Soon, she has a very
responsive, respectful, and eager group of babies.
Halter training
Foals get used to wearing a halter pretty quickly. At first they may react like a
giant fly has landed on their faces. But in short order, they come to ignore the
halter.
Breeders and trainers use different methods for teaching babies how to wear
a halter. Some people put a special foal-sized web halter on the baby after
she’s only a couple of hours old. Others wait a month or more to introduce
this piece of equipment.
Coauthor Dr. Kate waits to halter break her babies until they’re weaned, which is
at about five to six months of age. (We discuss weaning in more detail later in this
chapter.) Working with the foals in a small pen, she puts a halter that’s loose
enough to be comfortable but snug enough to prevent getting a foot caught in
the webbing on each horse. She attaches a soft cotton lead rope long enough to
trail on the ground for about 11⁄2 feet. (When the baby steps on the rope, she
learns how to stop and give to pressure — an important lesson when you’re
teaching her to accept a rider.)
Dr. Kate takes her babies into a pen several times each day and works with
them. This exercise is where the foals’ early training with handling comes in.
Because the babies aren’t afraid of pressure on their heads, she can gently
restrain them with the lead rope. While she has the foal restrained, she picks
up the foal’s feet, gives her injections, and deworms her. This lesson requires
time, patience, and repetition.
You can begin halter training your foal at birth by putting a halter on her
right after she’s born, or you can wait until the foal is anywhere from one
week to four weeks old to get started. The sooner your start with your baby,
the sooner your foal will know how to wear a halter.
If you’re new to horses and don’t have a lot of experience handling adult horses,
get a trainer or experienced horse person to help you teach your foal her
early lessons.
285
Chapter 16: Caring for the Newborn

Lead training
Training a foal to lead is trickier than teaching her to wear a halter. The best
age to start is when the baby is a couple of weeks old, after she’s already
learned to wear a halter.
People use different methods to teach foals to lead. One of the more popular
methods is using a butt rope and halter (see Figure 16-3). The butt rope attaches
to the halter and goes around the baby’s rump, behind the back legs. This
method works because it teaches the baby to give to the pressure of the rope
instead of resisting it, as she would if you just pulled on her head.
The details on training a foal to lead are beyond the scope of this book, so we
suggest that you check out the appendix for some of the books we suggest on
foal training to get you started.

Weaning
Mares and their foals stay together at all times until the weaning process begins.
A lot of different ideas exist as to when to wean a foal (in other words, when to
permanently remove her from her mother). In nature, foals wean themselves at
around five or six months of age. In domestic situations, they sometimes wean
as early as three months. Some people believe that it’s easier on the mare to
have the baby removed early. Others believe that it’s better to leave the foal
with the mare until the baby is more mature.
Both of your authors believe that it’s better to wean a foal in its fifth or sixth
month. By this time, the foal has become much more independent of her mom
and is eating well on her own. The mare’s milk production begins to decrease
gradually at about the third month, which encourages the baby to eat more
solid food.
A number of different weaning methods exist. Some handlers wean foals grad-
ually, slowly separating them at a farther and farther distance from their
moms. On the other hand, some handlers take foals away cold turkey.
Although your individual situation determines what works best for you, the
most important factor in your plan should be to minimize as much stress as
possible for both mare and foal, to prevent injury to both, and to maintain
adequate nutrition for the growth of the foal. See the appendix for resources
that you can use to wean your foal.
Coauthor Dr. Kate’s method of weaning starts with putting the broodmares
and foals all together in a group so that the babies make friends with each other.
(This togetherness is also helpful because it teaches the babies how to behave
properly around other horses.) At weaning time, the mares move into a pasture
next door with a safe 5-foot no-climb woven fence between them. Although the
mares and weanlings hang out at the fence for several days to be near each
other, Dr. Kate doesn’t hear much whinnying or see signs of stress. The moms
and babies can all see one another, but the babies can’t nurse. The mares’ milk
quickly dries up, and the babies have friends to play with.

Helping Your Horse 
Age Gracefully
In This Chapter
 Exploring health problems in older horses
 Keeping your senior horse happy and active
 Discovering the best way to retire your horse
S
enior horses are absolutely wonderful. They have a wisdom about them
that you just don’t see in a young horse. They’re also much more sensible,
less easy to spook, and often a real joy to be around.
In this chapter, we tell you how to keep your senior looking and feeling good
well into old age. You discover some of the common health problems seen in
older horses, and we give you pointers on feeding and exercising your old
faithful. We also give you pointers on how to know when it’s time for your
buddy to retire.
Knowing How Old Is Old
It used to be that horses didn’t live much into their 20s. But these days, it’s
not uncommon to see a horse in his early- to mid-30s still doing light work
and enjoying life despite a few aches and pains.
Just as with people, every horse is an individual, and some age better than
others. Technically, a horse is considered a senior when he hits about the age
of 15. Many horses work well past this age, and for some horses, 15 finds them
in their prime.
The way a horse is cared for early in his life does seem to play a significant
role in how well he navigates his senior years. So take the advice in the rest
of this book to heart!

Handling Common Health Issues 
in Your Senior Horse
When horses age, their bodies begin to slowly give out. They start developing
problems much like senior humans do. That doesn’t mean that they still can’t
be productive, however. You just need to understand the difficulties that come
with equine old age so that you can help manage them.
Vision problems
As horses age, their eyes undergo changes. Your senior horse may not see as
well as she did in her younger days.
As the lenses of your horse’s eyes age, the tissue fibers become more densely
compacted, leading to something called nuclear sclerosis. Most people know
this condition as cataracts (see Chapter 11 for details). The retina also under-
goes aging, and between the two issues, your horse’s vision declines.
One of the first changes that you’ll probably notice about your horse’s eyesight
is her loss of night vision. Light can’t get through the cloudy lens to get to her
aging retina. Some loss of peripheral vision is common too.
The result of this vision loss is that your horse may be much more prone to
spook at stuff she didn’t spook at before. For this reason, some older horses
suddenly act as though they’re 2 years old even though they’re going on 20!
(Chapter 3 has more information about spooking.)
You can continue to ride your senior horse with these vision changes. Just be
aware that she may not see that well, especially at night. (Have your vet
examine your horse’s eyes if she acts particularly spooky at night.) Let your
horse know when you’re near her by talking to her as you approach.
Even if your senior horse’s vision seems normal, keep a close watch on her eyes.
As her immunity weakens with age, she’s more susceptible to eye disease. If you
see any kind of change in your horse’s eyes, such as opacity, inflammation,
squinting, or increased tearing, contact your veterinarian.
If you have a horse with serious vision loss, and your veterinarian has
addressed all treatable causes, don’t make sudden changes to your horse’s
environment. Horses who are sight impaired develop almost a sense of
“radar” and do very well in familiar surroundings.
290
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

Tooth problems
Old horses can be plagued by tooth problems. That’s because they can literally
wear down their teeth with years of chewing fibrous material.
Dental care is hugely important as your horse ages. Some horses live long
enough to outlive their teeth!
One problem more common in older horses than younger ones is periodontal
disease. Infection in the gum progresses until the tooth is lost or must be
extracted. This isn’t good because your senior horse needs all the teeth she
can get. Tooth loss can compromise chewing and affect the wear of remaining
teeth. (Figure 17-1 shows the worn teeth of a 20-year-old horse.)
Watch your horse for signs of tooth trouble. These include:
 Dropping food while eating
 Salivating excessively while eating
 Bouts of colic (see Chapter 11)
 Eating very slowly
 Unexplained weight loss
 Coarse-looking manure (Chapter 2 describes the appearance of normal
manure)
 Fussing while wearing a bit
 Reluctance to have face or muzzle touched

Chapter 17: Helping Your Horse Age Gracefully

If you see any of these symptoms in your horse, call your veterinarian right
away. If the vet confirms a tooth problem that can’t be corrected with dental
care, be sure to adjust your senior’s diet, as we explain later in this chapter.
Arthritis
Finding a senior horse who doesn’t have some level of arthritis is hard to do.
After a while, the joints start to give out and stiffen.
Although some horses have very bad arthritis — so bad that they can barely
walk — others have just a mild case. If your older horse seems stiff when you
first take her out of her stall in the morning, and then she loosens up after a
bit of exercise, she probably has arthritis. Or, if she has persistent lameness
on one or more legs and your vet has ruled out laminitis and navicular or
another type of lameness, arthritis is the likely cause.
Here are some steps that you can take to manage your horse’s arthritis:
 Give her room. The more space an arthritic horse has to live in, the
better her arthritis will be. A pasture is the best environment for an
arthritic horse because she’s more likely to move around. (See Chapter 4
for more about pastures.)
 Provide daily exercise. If your horse lives in a stall, it’s imperative that
you take her for at least a 30-minute daily walk around the barn to get
her joints moving. Talk to your vet about how much and what kind of
riding you should be doing with your horse; hard riding will make her
arthritis worse. (We discuss exercising a senior in detail later in this
chapter; flip to Chapter 5 for general exercise information.)
 Warm up slowly. When you exercise your arthritic horse, start slowly.
She’ll be stiff at first and will need more time to loosen up than she did
when she was younger. Allow at least 10 minutes of warm-up time before
a workout.
 Give joint supplements. Talk to your veterinarian about putting your
horse on daily joint supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin,
and MSM. (Chapter 8 has the full scoop on supplements.)
If your horse’s arthritis gets worse despite these guidelines, consult with
your vet about putting your horse on medication to help her feel more com-
fortable. We discuss arthritis and other soundness issues in more detail in
Chapter 11.
292
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

An inability to keep weight on
Senior horses sometimes get pretty thin in their old age. Sometimes, they
can’t digest their food as well as they did in their younger days, resulting in
getting less nutrition and less weight on their bones. Or their thinness could
be the result of another problem. Whatever the cause, you can take steps to
manage the weight loss.
If your older horse is losing weight, follow these steps to help her:
 Contact your veterinarian. First, you need to make sure that your horse
isn’t suffering from a serious illness or condition. Have your vet examine
her.
 Check her teeth. Older horses are more susceptible to tooth problems,
which can keep them from properly chewing their food. Poorly chewed
food doesn’t digest well, leaving your horse with a void in her nutrition.
(We talk about tooth problems earlier in this chapter.)
 Change her diet. If your older horse is eating grass hay and can’t seem
to keep weight on, you may need to add a legume hay to her diet, or
perhaps a concentrated senior feed. (See the later section “Feeding Your
Senior Horse” for more information.)
A loss of muscle
As horses age, their muscles start to lose some elasticity and tone, especially
if they aren’t being worked very much. Coauthor Audrey first got her horse,
Red Playboy, when he was 18. This senior horse had a bad case of being out
of shape, and his loss of muscle had caused his back to sag and his belly muscles
to hang down, causing him to develop back pain. (Figure 17-2 shows a horse
with a loss of muscle.) Audrey got him back into shape by providing him with
regular exercise every day; she gradually increased his exercise over a period
of time to lessen the stress on his body.
The best way to keep an older horse from losing muscle is to keep her busy.
Even a light workload goes a long way toward keeping those muscles in
shape. Walking up hills is good for your horse, as is backing up and trotting in
a straight line. (Avoid trotting in circles because it can put undo stress on her
legs.) See the later section “Making Sure Your Senior Horse Stays Active” for
more information.
293
Chapter 17: Helping Your Horse Age Gracefully

Feeding Your Senior Horse
Older horses often need to be on a special diet, for a number of different reasons.
These include:
 Worn teeth. Old horses sometimes have teeth that are so worn that they
have trouble chewing (see the earlier section “Tooth problems” for infor-
mation). These horses should be on feed that’s easy for them to swallow
without having to chew much. These can include some types of complete
senior feeds, or hay cubes or pellets that have been soaked in water.
 Protein intolerance. Senior horses can’t metabolize protein as well as
their younger counterparts. Diets high in protein (such as all alfalfa
diets) result in excessive urination and very wet stalls. Switching to a
mostly grass hay diet can help with this issue.
 Weight issues. Some senior horses have trouble maintaining their
weight (as we explain earlier in this chapter). These horses should be
fed hay cubes or a complete senior diet in addition to hay to help them
keep some meat on their bones.
Before you make any changes to your senior horse’s diet, talk to your veteri-
narian. He or she can guide you toward the best food for your horse in his
golden years. Flip to Chapter 7 for the skinny on feeding fundamentals.

Making Sure Your Senior 
Horse Stays Active
Some people make the mistake of thinking that an older horse should be left
alone to spend her remaining days in peace and quiet. This couldn’t be further
from the truth. Older horses — especially those who have worked throughout
their lives — often do poorly when put out to pasture to live a quiet life of
retirement.
Just like people, horses need to feel needed, and having a regular job to do —
even if it’s for just half an hour a day — gives an old horse a reason to keep
living. Plus, the exercise is good for those old joints, tendons, and muscles, as
long as it isn’t too strenuous.
You can give your senior horse exercise in a few different ways, as we explain
in the following sections. (We start with the most strenuous activity first.)
Chapter 5 has general information on exercising your horse.
Riding
If your senior horse is relatively sound, you can keep riding her for as long as
your veterinarian says it’s okay. Many horses well into their teens and 20s are
ridden frequently, taken out on the trail (see Figure 17-3), or even shown and
competed. (In fact, coauthor Audrey’s senior gelding, Red, entered his first
parade at the age of 19.) As long as your senior horse is healthy, you can keep
riding her.
That said, remember that older horses take longer to warm up than young
horses, so they need time to limber up. Give your horse at least 10 minutes of
walking before you start to trot or canter.
When riding a senior horse on the trail, be aware that a lot of hill work may
not be good for her legs. Going up and down a lot of hills can be tough on the
joints, tendons, and muscles, and may shorten the amount of time that your
horse stays sound into her senior years. Working in small circles isn’t great for
old horses either. Lots of walking straight on flat ground is the best exercise
for seniors.
295
Chapter 17: Helping Your Horse Age Gracefully

Hand-walking
Some older horses can no longer be ridden, but that doesn’t mean that they
need to spend the rest of their lives stuck in a pasture or stall. Hand-walking a
senior horse can do wonders for her body and her mind.
Even half an hour a day of hand-walking helps your senior feel like she has a
job to do. It provides her with much needed attention and helps solidify your
bond. It also loosens her joints, muscles, and tendons and gives her something
to look forward to each day.
Before you hand-walk your old buddy, be sure to clean out her feet and
groom her (see Chapter 4 for details). Senior horses thrive on attention, and
some people believe that horses live longer when they’re regularly fussed
over by their favorite human.

296
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

Turning out
Healthy, sound senior horses benefit from regular turnout. If your senior is
kept in a stall or small paddock, she needs to be turned out regularly so that
she can stretch her legs. Because of her age, however, you need to handle her
turnout carefully.
Hand-walk your horse for 10 minutes before turning her out to make sure that
her joints, tendons, and muscles are loose. You don’t want her tearing around
the turnout without a warm-up because she may hurt herself. Don’t chase her
around the turnout, either. Let her do what she feels like doing in there. Even
if it’s just standing in a corner looking at the scenery, give her the option of
doing what she feels up to.
Retiring Your Senior Horse
As we explain earlier in this chapter, senior horses can work well into their
20s, and sometimes into their 30s. Coauthor Audrey once knew a lesson
horse who carried little kids around until he was 32 years old. He was working
the day before he passed away from natural causes.
Don’t be too quick to retire your senior horse just because he’s up there in age.
Before you do it, take a close look at him to make sure that he’s really in need
of retirement.
Judging your horse’s condition
The most important aspect to determining whether your senior needs to be
retired is his condition. Ask yourself the following questions:
 Is my horse serviceably sound?
 Can my horse still be ridden?
 If he has a health issue, can it be managed so that he can still work?
 What is his attitude about work? Is he still willing to perform when asked?
If you answer yes to these questions, retirement may be premature for your
senior horse.
If you aren’t sure whether your senior horse needs to quit working altogether,
ask your veterinarian for advice. He or she can evaluate your horse and give
you an expert opinion on the subject.
297
Chapter 17: Helping Your Horse Age Gracefully

Tapering off work
If your older horse definitely needs to be retired — and you verified this with
your veterinarian — it’s important that you slowly taper off your horse’s work
instead of just stopping it cold turkey. A sudden, complete halting of work will
be a shock to your horse, both mentally and physically. If he’s physically fit
and you suddenly cease all exercise, he will become pent up and unhappy. He
will also miss his daily routine and may ultimately become depressed and
lethargic.
Instead, slow your horse’s workload gradually. If you were riding him for an
hour a day, cut down to riding an hour a day just a few days a week. Then,
eventually ride him only 30 minutes for those few days a week. Get down to
one day until you eventually stop riding him altogether, and replace the riding
with hand-walking (which we discuss earlier in this chapter). Do this over a
period of several weeks to help him get used to his new life of leisure.
Putting your horse out to pasture
If your horse is definitely in need of retirement, and you have the means to
put him out to pasture for the remainder of his days, remember that you still
need to take care of your horse. You can’t just put him out in a field and
forget about him. He still needs daily care.
Your older horse needs company too. Don’t put him in a pasture by himself.
Get him a buddy so that he’s not lonely. (But keep an eye out to make sure
that the buddy isn’t bullying him, or vice versa!) You can provide him with a
buddy by boarding him at a pasture with other horses, boarding a friend’s
horse in your pasture, or getting another horse (senior or otherwise) as a
companion.
Before you place your horse in a pasture, make certain that the pasture is safe
and can provide for your horse’s nutritional needs (see Chapters 7 and 9 for
details on this). Your horse may need additional forage, instead of just living
on pasture grass alone. Talk to your veterinarian for advice on what to feed him.
Although your senior horse is out in a pasture and not working, don’t forget
his feet! Horses in the wild don’t need their feet trimmed because they travel
for so many hours a day on such rough terrain that they wear their feet down
naturally. A horse in a pasture is a whole different situation.
298
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

Your retired horse requires the same foot care as he did before. As an older
horse, his feet may grow more slowly, but they’re also more prone to cracking
and brittleness. Talk to your veterinarian about pulling your horse’s shoes (if
his feet are shod), and consider having his feet trimmed regularly by an 
experienced barefoot trimmer. (See Chapter 4 for the basics of hoof care.)
Keep a close watch on his feet, too. Clean them daily, especially if the pasture
becomes muddy, because this is when a fungal infection of the frog called
thrush can rear its ugly head. (Chapter 11 has general information on fungal
infections.)
Observe your pasture pet every day, too, and watch how he walks. Note any
pain or changes in his gait, and call your vet if something doesn’t look right.
Keep an eye on other aspects of your senior horse’s health, as well. For example:
 Give him treats every day, and watch how he chews to make sure that
he’s not experiencing difficulty. (See the earlier section “Tooth problems”
for details.)
 Take him out of the pasture and groom him. Give him the once-over
while you brush him, and apply insect repellant during bug season.
With regular attention, your retired horse will learn to love being out to 
pasture and enjoying his golden years.

n the old days, horses were just commodities, easily bought and sold and

what would happen when the horse became old and couldn’t work anymore.

to get a job done. Caring horse owners make provisions for their senior horses
so that they can retire (see Chapter 17 for details), and for horses who are ill
and can’t be cured. These people often choose to give these horses a dignified
end as a thank-you for years of service and companionship.
When a horse is too old or too ill to be able to go on without horrific suffering,
the kindest thing a caring owner can do is help that horse have a swift, pain-free
end to her life. This is done with euthanasia, administered by a veterinarian.
Although giving the order to put a horse down is always a difficult one, it’s a
selfless act when done with the horse’s best interest at heart.
In this chapter, we take a look at euthanasia, and we give you guidance on when
to choose this option for your horse. We also provide information on what to
do with your horse’s remains and how to cope with grief from losing your
equine friend.

Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 
Facing the Process of Euthanasia
The technical term for putting a horse “to sleep” is euthanasia. Although other
methods of ending a horse’s life are still used in certain parts of the country —
like shooting a horse in the head or sending it off to slaughter — we maintain
that euthanasia administered by a qualified veterinarian is the most humane
way to put a horse down. In the following sections, we give you a few guidelines
for deciding when euthanasia is the right option for your horse, and we look
at the basic process.
Sometimes owners choose to be present during the euthanasia to be with their
horse during her transition to the “other side.” We don’t know how much this
helps the horse during the process, but being present can help some owners
deal with their grief by saying goodbye. For other owners, it’s a traumatic
experience. When euthanasia is administered to a horse who’s standing, the horse
falls over or collapses during the process. This can be upsetting to some owners,
who may opt not to be present during the euthanasia.
Deciding when it’s time 
to put down your horse
Knowing when it’s time to put a horse down can be tricky. Most people are
reluctant to give the go-ahead to a veterinarian to give a horse the necessary
injection. People feel like they’re “playing God,” and are loath to make this
decision. No doubt about it, this is one of the hardest decisions you’ll ever
make. Fortunately, your veterinarian can help you figure out when the time is
right. Veterinarians are trained in euthanasia in vet school and, unfortunately,
have plenty of opportunity to practice it in their day-to-day work. Although
the vast majority of equine veterinarians would rather do anything else than
put a horse down, it’s part of their job and one that they understand very well.
Keeping the following elements in mind while discussing the situation with
your vet can help you make this very difficult decision:
 Quality of life. Think about the horse’s quality of life. Is the horse suffering?
Is her life filled with pain? Does she have more bad or marginal days
than good days? Will her disease continue to worsen as time goes on?
Having your horse euthanized is more humane than letting her suffer if
the condition is painful and incurable.
 Pain. Consider how much pain the horse is experiencing. Does walking
cause the horse pain? Is the horse’s pain so bad that medication can no
longer control it?

 Mobility. Horses are very mobile creatures. Walking, trotting, and galloping
are all essentials to equine happiness. Old horses can get so stiff and
sore that doing anything other than walking can be difficult. But can the
horse do at least that? Is even a slow walk painful for the horse?
 Ability to stand. Because they’re prey animals, horses are meant to stand
most of the time so that they can make a quick getaway if danger presents
itself. When a horse gets to the point in life where she can no longer stand,
she’s suffering not only mentally but also physically. A horse who’s forced
to lie down because she’s unable to stand is a horse who’s ready to be
euthanized.
 Your finances. It may be difficult to consider, but is keeping the horse
alive costing more than your pocketbook can stand? Does the horse
stand little chance of recovering, and just keeping her alive is costing
more than you can spare? One of the most painful aspects of deciding on
euthanasia comes with having to consider the cost of continued vet
care. However, if your horse is very old or if her condition is incurable,
and throwing more money at the situation isn’t going to help her but will
undoubtedly hurt you, don’t feel guilty about making finances a part of
your decision.
Human beings have a hard time letting go of what they love. Sometimes, because
of this, owners hold on too long to their horses. Coauthor Dr. Kate has seen
this time and again — owners who let horses suffer too long before making
the decision to give them a peaceful rest with dignity. She says:
I will say that I personally have never heard an owner say, “I put him to
sleep too soon,” but all too often owners lament, “I should never have let
her suffer this long . . . I should have done this sooner.” I will always speak
for those who cannot speak because this is my job and honors the oath I
took — that I will alleviate suffering. I’m sure that I practice more euthanasias
than most veterinarians because of my ER experience and my alternative
practice. Often, owners come to me when all other avenues of treatment
have been exhausted, so whether Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine
(TCVM) can help their horse or not, I’m the last veterinarian they experience.
It’s a huge and humbling responsibility.
Having memories of your horse feeling good at the end is best. Don’t let the
last memory you have of her be one of pain or suffering, if at all possible. Trust
your veterinarian to help you understand that some problems won’t get better,
and that everything ages and dies. What a blessing that you can help your
horses and give them the gift of euthanasia when it’s time.
303
Chapter 18: Reaching the End of Your Horse's Life

Understanding how euthanasia works
When a veterinarian administers euthanasia to a horse, he or she uses a
barbiturate drug. Euthanasia drugs are injected in large quantities into a horse’s
bloodstream, stopping brain function almost instantly. The horse doesn’t feel
any pain during this process; essentially, she feels as if she’s just going to
sleep. She loses consciousness (similar to being anesthetized for surgery)
and then stops breathing. Soon afterward, the heartbeat ceases. The entire
process takes only a few minutes.
In many cases, veterinarians may administer a sedative to the horse before
administering the euthanasia drug to help make an excited horse more relaxed.
A relaxed horse may accept the euthanasia drug more easily and is less likely
to fight the sensation that comes with the final injection. Sedation prior to
the final injection also may allow your veterinarian to help the horse lie down
safely and quietly, which is much less stressful for both owner and horse. Ask
your veterinarian whether sedation can help to ensure that your horse isn’t
distressed during the process.
Taking Care of Your Horse’s Remains
Because horses are such large animals, disposing of their remains can be
rather tricky. Unlike a cat or a dog, even transporting the body requires
considerable work and planning. Local laws can also determine what you’re
allowed to do with your horse after he passes. You have a few options for your
horse’s remains after euthanasia, as you find out in the following sections.
Plan ahead and decide what you want to do before your horse is put down.
Emotions can be raw right after the horse’s passing, and making a decision
may be difficult at that time. In addition, coauthor Dr. Kate strongly recommends
to her clients that they not be present when their horse’s remains are
removed. Ask a friend to securely cover the horse with a blanket or tarp and
let him or her handle the removal.
Burial
If you’re fortunate enough to have your own expanse of land and live in a
county where it’s legal to bury a horse on your own property, your first
option for your horse’s remains may be burial.
304
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

In order to bury your horse on your own land, you need to rent a backhoe (if
you don’t have one yourself). A backhoe can not only dig a grave deep
enough for your horse’s remains (the hole must be six feet deep or more
depending on the legal requirements in your area), but can also transport
your horse’s body from where it lies elsewhere on your property. The back-
hoe can also fill the grave with dirt, covering the body thoroughly.
If your horse will be buried on your property, let someone else put him in the
grave and cover his body with dirt. Watching the process of moving such a
large body can be unpleasant, and as a grieving owner, you don’t need to see it.
If you don’t have your own property and don’t know anyone who will permit
you to bury your horse on their land, consider having your horse buried at a
pet cemetery. Keep in mind that this option costs a few thousand dollars,
including the money that you pay to have your horse’s body taken to the ceme-
tery. The plus side is that you always have a place where you can go to visit
your horse. Most pet cemeteries are bucolic places, and many owners find
great solace in knowing that their beloved equine is buried in such a place.
Cremation
If you don’t have your own land, a less expensive alternative to burial at a pet
cemetery is cremation. More and more pet cemeteries are starting to offer
cremation services for horses. Although this method of disposing of your
horse’s remains is still costly (usually between $1,000 and $2,000), it’s
cheaper than burial.
If you have your horse cremated, you can keep his ashes with you at your
home, or scatter them on your property. If you choose to keep them, you can
purchase an urn or memorial box for the ashes. You can purchase urns and
boxes on the Internet, or through the pet cemetery that does the cremation.
If you want to scatter your horse’s ashes, be sure to inform the pet cemetery
of this before you have your horse cremated. The crematorium handles your
horse’s remains differently if the ashes are to be scattered than if they’ll
remain in an urn or box.
Rendering
The least expensive way to handle your horse’s body is to have it rendered.
For a relatively small fee of usually just a few hundred dollars, a livestock
remains transport company or the rendering company comes to pick up your
horse’s body and takes it to a rendering plant.
305
Chapter 18: Reaching the End of Your Horse's Life

For most horse owners — especially those who don’t have their own property
for burial and have limited funds — this is the best option. The horse’s body
will be used to make fertilizer or other organic materials.
Not all counties have rendering plants that accept horse carcasses. Discuss
disposal of your horse’s body with your veterinarian when the time comes.
He or she can tell you whether rendering is an option where you live.
Grieving for Your Horse
Losing a horse you love is one of the most painful things you’ll ever endure.
Both of your coauthors have gone through this loss and speak with experience.
In order to get past the pain and anguish of losing your horse, you must experi-
ence grief. Some people think that grief is appropriate only when you lose a
beloved human. But if you love your horse, you’re entitled to grieve as if you
had lost a human in your life. In fact, you need to grieve in order to heal.
Surveying the stages of grief
Psychologists have discovered that grief has various aspects to it. These aspects
are sometimes called “stages of grief,” but they don’t always come in any 
particular order, and in fact can come and go alternatively.
The following emotions are normal and part of the process of grieving the
loss of your horse. Allow yourself to feel them, and try not to judge yourself.
You may feel at times like you’re losing your mind, but in reality, you’re
experiencing what all people experience when they lose someone they care
about. Here are the different aspects of grief:
 Denial. You have trouble believing that your horse is dying or has died.
The situation feels unreal.
 Anger. You feel enraged that this has happened to you and your horse.
 Guilt. You irrationally feel like your horse’s death is somehow your fault.
 Depression. You have trouble caring about things you normally enjoy.
 Numbness. You have moments when you can’t feel anything at all.
 Anguish. You have waves of intense emotional pain, and sometimes you
can’t stop crying.
 Acceptance. You start to feel a sense of acceptance about your loss.
Be aware that you may even experience some of these aspects to grief before
your horse dies, if you know that the end is coming.
306
Part IV: Horse Care for All Stages of Life 

The amount of time that it takes to finally reach acceptance — and stay there —
varies from person to person. If you find that you’re unable to accept what’s
happened, or if you just need support as you grieve your horse, contact one
of the support group hotlines listed in this book’s appendix. For additional
information about grieving, check out Grieving For Dummies, by Greg Harvey,
PhD (Wiley).
Remembering and honoring your horse
After your horse has passed, you may want to do something to acknowledge
her passing. Although holding a funeral for a horse is rare, people do other
things that help them find closure. Here are some ideas that may help:
 Lay flowers in your horse’s stall.
 If your horse has been buried, lay a marker on her grave.
 If your horse has been cremated, scatter her ashes in a place that means
something to you — perhaps a favorite place she liked to trail ride, or in
her pasture.
 Write a letter to your horse telling her how you feel about her.
 Create an album of photos and keepsakes.
 Donate to a charitable cause in your horse’s name, plant a tree or flowers,
or help another animal in need.
When coauthor Audrey’s blind Appaloosa mare Rosie died, Audrey donated
the board she was about to pay that month to a horse rescue, in Rosie’s
name. The rescue put a plaque with Rosie’s name in its memorial garden.
Friends may like making donations for you, too. Receiving a note in the mail
from a charitable organization saying that a donation has been made in your
horse’s honor is touching. After Rosie died, one of Audrey’s friends donated
money to help find a cure for the disease that caused Rosie to lose her eyesight.
Coauthor Dr. Kate was fortunate enough to be able to bury her sweet old
mare, Glo, in a pasture on her Texas farm, beneath a grove of trees in Glo’s
favorite spot. Dr. Kate planted daffodils there that will naturalize and spread
every year (horses and deer won’t eat daffodils). The flowers remind Dr. Kate
of how Glo brought so much joy into her life. Dr. Kate further honors Glo by
always wearing at shows the first buckle she ever won in cutting, on Glo,
even though Dr. Kate has won lots of fancier, more impressive buckles since.
The bottom line is that you should do whatever works best for you to help
you remember and honor your horse. Acts such as these help you grieve and
enable you to accept what’s happened to your horse. In time, you’ll find that
you’re able to open your heart to love another horse.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens is a mixture of important information
regarding your horse’s health. In these chapters, we
provide you with ten signs that your horse is under the
weather, as well as ten pointers on how to keep him healthy.

Chapter 19
Ten Signs of Horse Illness
In This Chapter
 Recognizing signs of equine distress
 Discovering the causes of bad behavior
G
ood horse owners get to know their horses very well. They see them
every day and come to understand all their behavioral nuances: how
they eat, how often they lie down, how they behave under saddle. Good
horse owners figure out how their horses act when they’re feeling fine — and
how they act when they aren’t.
In this chapter, we alert you to behaviors or conditions that you may notice
in your horse if he’s under the weather. Your horse can’t talk, so all he can do
is demonstrate his discomfort in the following ways. Pay close attention.
Your horse is depending on you.
A Fever
When a horse is feeling well, his temperature is usually between 99 and 101.4
degrees Fahrenheit. If he’s battling an infection, whether bacterial or viral, his
temperature is either below or above that range.
When a horse has a fever, he may exhibit some or all of the following behaviors:
 Lack of appetite
 Lethargy or depression
 Heavy breathing
A horse with a fever may have other symptoms as well, depending on what’s
plaguing him. The fever may be accompanied by nasal discharge, coughing,
or diarrhea. Or, it may be completely void of symptoms other than those pre-
viously listed.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you suspect that your horse has a fever, take his temperature by using the
directions we give in Chapter 2. If the fever is below 97 or above 102, call
your veterinarian immediately. If it falls between 97 and 99, or between 101.4
and 102, wait a few hours and take the temperature again to make sure that
this was just a normal variation and that it hasn’t gone up or down in range.
Diarrhea
The equine digestive system is an efficient tool that’s good at processing difficult-
to-digest plant material. Bacteria located in the horse’s gut are instrumental in
breaking down cellulous plant fiber and turning it into a nutritional element.
When the delicate bacterial population in the horse’s gut becomes imbal-
anced, she can develop diarrhea. Other issues can also cause diarrhea, and
may include:
 Salmonella
 Potomac Horse Fever
 Clostridium colitis (irritation of the colon caused by the Clostridium
bacteria)
 Cryptosporidia (a protozoan parasite that affects the digestive system)
 Blister beetle poisoning
 Drug toxicity
 Sand impaction
 Intestinal parasites
 Oak and acorn poisoning
If your horse develops diarrhea — very loose stool that’s watery — possibly
accompanied by lack of appetite, call your vet right away. Diarrhea can rob
your horse of valuable nutrients and minerals, and cause severe dehydration
and malnutrition in a very short amount of time. (See Chapter 2 to find out
what normal manure looks like.)
An Inability to Pass Manure
One of the most dangerous conditions for any horse is an intestinal
impaction, which can cause an inability to pass manure. A horse with an
untreated impaction won’t live long.

You can tell that your horse is having trouble passing manure if you see one
or more of the following signs:
 Lack of normal amount of manure in his stall or pasture
 Signs of colic, including stretching out, biting at sides, pawing, or rolling
(see Chapter 11 for more about colic)
 Difficult passage of hard, dry balls of manure (Chapter 2 explains what
normal manure looks like)
If you see any of these symptoms, call your vet right away. He or she can
treat your horse with medications that provide a laxative effect and can get
the manure passing through as it should.
Always keep a source of clean, fresh water available to your horse. One of the
leading causes of intestinal impaction is lack of water intake.
Heavy or Noisy Breathing
Horses are athletic by nature and have large lungs and substantial airways.
So if you hear your horse breathing noisily, or if you see her breathing hard
even though she hasn’t been exercising, something is amiss.
Noisy breathing during exertion can be a sign of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), also called heaves. This can be similar to asthma in humans,
and is often allergy related. Horses with this condition can be treated with
medication and environmental changes to help them breathe better. (See
Chapter 11 for more about COPD.)
Heavy breathing without exertion can be a sign of a high fever. It can also be
an expression of pain and stress.
If your horse’s breathing changes from its normal pattern to something faster or
noisier, call your veterinarian so that he or she can figure out what’s going on.
Weight Loss or Gain
If your horse’s diet has been consistent but you notice a dramatic weight loss
or gain, something is going on with his health. (Chapter 2 can help you deter-
mine a normal weight for your horse.)
313
Chapter 19: Ten Signs of Horse Illness

Weight loss can be caused by any number of health problems, including tooth
problems, digestive troubles, kidney or liver disease, Cushing’s disease (a
metabolic disorder), parasite infestation, or cancer. Only your vet will be able
to help ascertain the cause of the problem, so you need to get him or her in
the loop.
Weight gain can be the result of a lack of exercise and too much feed. If your
horse’s food and exercise routine has remained the same and your horse is
putting on weight, he may be suffering from a metabolic or endocrine disease.
If you have a mare who you recently acquired, she may be pregnant. Again,
only your vet can help you figure out why your horse is putting on weight.
Limping
If your horse is limping, she’s considered lame. This diagnosis means that she’s
sore on one or more of her feet or legs, and isn’t carrying her weight evenly
on all four legs. Lameness can be apparent at the walk, trot, or canter.
Lameness can be caused by something as minor as a rock lodged in the
bottom of a hoof, or something as serious as a bone fracture. Other causes of
lameness can include:
 Hoof abscess
 Laminitis (a condition where the coffin bone rotates inside the hoof)
 Muscle soreness
 Navicular disease (a condition affecting the navicular bone inside the hoof)
 Arthritis
 Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) (a disorder affecting joint cartilage)
 Tendonitis (a damaged or injured tendon)
Lameness can be very obvious or almost imperceptible to all but a very trained
eye. But if you learn to really know your horse, you’ll be able to spot even
minor problems before they become serious.
When your horse is doing well, feel her legs to determine what’s normal so
that you can spot any subtleties in heat, tenderness, and swelling early on.
Start at the top of each leg and run your hands down to the hoof. Notice the
temperature of your horse’s legs and hooves, and the look and feel of all the
nuances of her normal bone structure.
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If your horse acts lame when you’re riding her, stop and get off. Check her
hooves for signs of a foreign object. If you see something minor like a stone in
her hoof, remove it and see whether that solves the problem. If you find 
something that’s gone deep into her foot, or if you find no visible problem 
at all, put your horse back in her stall, and call your veterinarian.
Many horse owners are tempted to just let a lame horse rest in her stall for a
few days in hope that the lameness will disappear on its own. But without a
vet’s involvement, you have no way of knowing the cause of the lameness. Your
veterinarian can provide treatment as well as recommendations for rehabili-
tation. Remember that untreated lameness can often worsen and become
even more serious.
Lethargy or Depression
Horses are generally cheerful creatures, acting alert when new stimuli are added
to their environment and enthusiastically accepting good training. When a
horse acts lethargic or depressed, something is bothering him. In some cases,
the trouble is physical. Pain and physical discomfort can prompt a horse to
act depressed and void of energy. If your horse starts acting depressed, 
suspect a physical malady.
Psychological issues can also cause a horse to act depressed. Unlike humans,
who have complicated psychological problems, horses usually have simple
issues. They’re lonely, bored, or unhappy about the way they’re being han-
dled. They don’t like their living conditions or they don’t get along with their
herd mates. Any of these things can cause a horse to become depressed.
A veterinary behaviorist is your horse’s best friend if something like this is
bothering him. Have your horse checked out for a physical problem first. If
your vet gives him a clean bill of health, contact a behaviorist through the
Animal Behavior Society. (See the appendix for contact information, and
check out Chapter 3 for details on the connection between a horse’s mind
and health.)
Aggression
A horse who’s born nasty is rare. Horses become mean when they’re unhappy.
Often this unhappiness can be traced to pain somewhere in the body.
315
Chapter 19: Ten Signs of Horse Illness

Some horses are nasty because they have dominant personalities and have
never been trained to treat humans with respect, but these horses have
shown this behavior for a very long time. Normally nice horses who start
acting mean are letting you know that something is wrong with them.
Horses who aren’t getting enough to eat can become nasty, trying to bite
their handlers and other horses with the least provocation. Horses who
suffer pain from a poorly fitting saddle can get aggressive when they’re being
taken from their stalls.
If your horse suddenly becomes mean and aggressive toward you or any
other human, ask your vet to examine her to see whether she’s experiencing
pain or discomfort somewhere on her body.
Misbehavior under Saddle
Imagine having to carry weight on your back while it’s being pinched. That’s
what a horse with a poorly fitting saddle has to go through. It’s not long
before many horses in this situation start to rebel.
Misbehavior under saddle is often a clue that something is amiss with a
horse’s body. Bucking may be a sign of back pain when being ridden, as is
refusing to go forward. Refusing to hold the head in a normal position may
indicate mouth pain. Neck, shoulder, and croup pain can be demonstrated in
any number of ways.
Some horses are nonspecific in their protest, behaving in an uncooperative
manner the entire time they’re being ridden because they’re uncomfortable.
If your horse starts to misbehave when being ridden, have your veterinarian
give him a complete checkup. Before you call in a trainer for help with bad
behavior, be certain that it’s not the result of pain or discomfort. (See
Chapter 3 for more information about equine misbehaviors.)
Additional Signs of Pain
Horses tend to be stoic creatures. In the wild, the animal who acted sick was
the one most targeted by predators. So pretending not to be in pain was a
boon to your horse’s ancestors.
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If you get to know your horse well, you’ll be able to recognize whether she’s
in pain. The signs of pain depend on where the pain is coming from. Here are
some guidelines to help you determine whether your horse is feeling pain in a
particular part of her body:
 Leg: Limping, holding it up, not bearing full weight on a limb (we talk
about limping in more detail earlier in this chapter)
 Eye: Squinting, tearing, holding it closed
 Ear: Holding to the side, shaking head
 Mouth: Dropping food when eating, resistance to having bit inserted
 Head: Tilting while chewing, shaking while being ridden
 Abdomen: Rolling, pawing, kicking, and biting at belly, pacing
 Back: Flinching when pressure is applied, pinning ears or threatening to
bite when girth is tightened, misbehaving when ridden
Some horses are hard to figure out because they don’t show you where it
hurts by doing the things in this list. Instead, they’re just lethargic or irritable
(we discuss both conditions earlier in this chapter). In these cases, you need
a vet to help you figure out where the pain is coming from.
Avoid the temptation to give your horse any painkilling drugs (like phenylbuta-
zone or Banamine flunixin meglumine) before a veterinarian examines her.
These drugs can mask the signs of pain and make it harder for the vet to
make a diagnosis.

Ten Ways to Keep Your 
Horse Healthy
In This Chapter
 Reducing your horse’s stress
 Scheduling an annual exam with your veterinarian
 Engaging in routine care
 Recognizing the importance of daily exercise and good feed
 Trying out joint nutraceuticals
E
ven if you do everything right, your horse may someday get sick. But the
better you treat her on a daily basis, the less likely that is to happen.
In this chapter, we give you the top ten things that you need to do to keep your
horse happy and in good health. Follow these guidelines and you reduce 
your chances of having to deal with equine illness.
Minimize Stress
Horses are watchful creatures, and some are downright nervous. It’s under-
standable if you look at their history: horses evolved as prey animals over eons.
The habit of looking over their shoulders is genetically ingrained in them.
Consequently, horses are more prone to stress than a lot of other creatures.
Many horses get worked up when they’re placed in new situations. Most get
upset when they’re taken away from other horses. Some become overwrought
when they’re asked to ride in a trailer. Others get stressed when they’re taken
to shows and competitions.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Stress is bad for horses, just like it is for people. Too much stress can cause
the following problems in your horse:
 Diarrhea
 Digestive tract ulcers
 Compromised immune system
 Bad behavior
 Depression
Keeping stress completely out of your horse’s life is almost impossible. The
activities that owners ask their horses to partake in do put some pressure on
them. But you can certainly keep stress to a minimum. Here are a few pointers
to keep your horse relaxed and happy:
 Take care of her health by following all the advice in this chapter (and in
this book, for that matter!).
 Don’t ask her to live without another horse as a companion; if you can’t
afford more than one horse, consider boarding a friend’s horse on your
property, or keeping your horse at a boarding stable or friend’s house.
 Be patient when you’re riding or training her, and seek professional help
if necessary.
 Try to see the world from her perspective (such as understanding that
horses are prey and herd animals).
 Prepare her for new experiences by slowly introducing her to them.
 Let her be a horse. Give her time to unwind and just hang out, doing
what horses like to do: grazing, being around other horses, rolling, and
running loose in a big paddock or pasture.
Be aware that horses stress easily. Even if yours doesn’t show it outwardly, she
may be internalizing her stress. Keep her mental health in mind at all times,
and you’ll be sure to keep her stress to a minimum. See Chapter 3 for more
information about the connection between your horse’s mind and health.
Schedule an Annual Vet Exam
When money is tight, the first thing that horse owners often give up is having
a well-horse exam every year. After all, if your horse is feeling fine, why have
the vet come out?

Just like humans need to see their doctor every year for an annual checkup,
horses need to see the vet every year. Although your horse may seem healthy,
your vet can determine whether or not a problem is lurking undetected.
When you call your vet out for an annual exam, one of the first things that he
or she checks is your horse’s teeth (we talk about teeth in more detail later in
this chapter). He or she will also listen to your horse’s lungs and heart.
The vet will also ask you questions about your horse’s appetite and manure,
his performance when asked to work, and other basic questions. This is the
time to let the vet know if you’re seeing anything unusual, or if you have any
concerns about your horse. If something seems amiss, your vet can follow up
with whatever tests are deemed necessary to help get to the bottom of your
horse’s condition. You can also use this time to discuss your horse’s vaccination
and deworming program (which we discuss later in this chapter), and have
shots given if they’re due. (In fact, many owners schedule their horse’s annual
exam around the time vaccinations are needed so that the vet can give these at
the same time that he or she conducts the exam.)
You may also want to consider having your vet draw blood and run a full
blood count on your horse. This test allows your vet to see how well your
horse’s organs are functioning, whether he has any issues with white or red
blood cell count, and a host of other things.
By having your horse checked out once a year, you’re sure to stay on top of
his healthcare. You also build a rapport with your veterinarian, who will be
there to help you and will already know your horse in the event of an emergency.
Have Your Horse Vaccinated Annually
Horses are susceptible to a whole host of infectious diseases, many of which
can kill them. Fortunately, veterinary medicine has developed vaccines for
many of these diseases, making it easy for horse owners to protect their
equine companions.
The vaccines regularly given by veterinarians may include the following:
 Equine encephalomyelitis
 Influenza/rhinopneumonitis
 Tetanus
 West Nile virus
In addition to these vaccines, your veterinarian may recommend others spe-
cific to your area of the country and your horse’s circumstances.
321
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Keep Your Horse Healthy

The veterinary community is currently revising some of its long-standing
vaccination protocols. Many vets are recommending vaccination less often
than in the past. Nevertheless, having your horse inoculated against common
horse diseases every year is still important. Discuss a vaccination protocol
with your veterinarian and stick to it. Your horse’s life depends on it. Check
out Chapter 4 for more information on vaccinations.
File Your Horse’s Teeth Regularly
Horses have amazing jaws and teeth. They’re strong enough to grind down
the most fibrous of plant materials in a short amount of time. The catch is
that, in domestic life, a horse’s teeth need special care.
In the wild, horses manage to wear down their teeth evenly as they chew,
probably because of the varied plant life they ingest. When living with humans
and eating the same type of feed over and over, however, their teeth develop
problems. Molars in the back of the horse’s jaw wear unevenly, leaving points
on the outside and inside of the teeth that can cut into the horses’ cheeks
and tongue when she chews. Hooks can also form on the molars.
All this causes the horse to chew her food improperly and predisposes her to
infections in the mouth, as well as the development of more complicated dental/
oral problems. These situations may lead to problems such as weight loss or
poor overall body condition, colic (see Chapter 11 for details on colic), chok-
ing, or sinus infections, as well as misbehavior when a bit is in her mouth.
The best way to remedy the situation of unevenly worn teeth is to have the
points filed down as often as your veterinarian recommends it. The best person
for this job is an equine veterinarian. Vets are trained to file teeth correctly
and to also examine the horse’s mouth for other issues, such as an abscessed
or loose tooth.
Take Good Care of Your Horse’s Hooves
If you watch horses play or run, you get a good sense of how important their
feet and legs are to them. Nature built them to stand almost all the time, and
to move swiftly in a moment’s notice. Without healthy hooves and legs, a
horse isn’t all he should be. In fact, without healthy hooves and legs, your
horse may end up unable to be ridden or even function as a pasture orna-
ment. Horses need to be able to stand and move in order to survive.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

As a horse owner, you have an obligation to keep those hooves and legs in
good condition. You do this by providing quality hoof care on a regular basis.
As with feed, this isn’t an area to skimp on. Find a good farrier and stick to
the hoof-care schedule that he or she gives you. (For details on how to best
care for your horse’s hooves, see Chapter 4.)
Deworm Regularly
Internal parasites can wreak havoc with a horse’s internal organs. The sight
of a domestic horse who hasn’t been dewormed for much of her life is a sad
one indeed. Horses who are infested with internal parasites have a shortened
lifespan; these parasites literally suck the life out of them.
Deworming is easy to do thanks to many different deworming products now
available to horse owners. These dewormers aren’t expensive and they’re
easy to administer to your horse. You can buy them at your local tack and
feed store, through mail order catalogs specializing in equine products, or
through the Internet.
Your veterinarian is your best friend when you’re developing a good deworm-
ing program. The frequency of deworming and the type of dewormer that you
use is dependent on your horse’s age, how she’s kept, and the area of the
country where you live. Ask your vet to provide you with a good deworming
program, and stick to it. Your horse will be all the better for it. For more
details on internal parasites and deworming, see Chapter 4.
Exercise Daily
Horses were designed to move all day long, taking little steps as they graze.
When kept in stalls or paddocks, horses tend to stand around a lot. This puts
pressure on their joints, tendons, and ligaments because it’s unnatural. It also
reduces the motility of the horse’s digestive system.
By getting your horse out of his stall or paddock every day and getting him to
move around, you’re providing his legs with the movement that they need to
stay healthy. You’re also helping your horse’s circulation, and stimulating his
digestive system. All this adds up to a horse who has a healthier body that
will stay in good working order for a longer period of time.
323
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Keep Your Horse Healthy

Daily exercise also does wonders for a horse’s attitude. Horses who are cooped
up in stalls or paddocks become bored. Some get depressed. Others develop
stable vices (see Chapter 3 for a description of these unfortunate behaviors).
Just about any horse who is regularly cooped up in a stall and doesn’t get out
much will be unmanageable or difficult to ride on the rare times he does get to
come out. In fact, lack of exercise is one of the leading causes of training and
behavioral issues in horses used for recreational riding. Getting your horse out
once a day for some exercise and mental stimulation helps him stay sane.
Chapter 5 has the scoop on exercising your horse to keep him healthy.
Feed Quality Food
You are what you eat, even if you’re a horse. Feed your horse quality food
and you have a healthier horse. It’s very simple.
Horses need roughage to stay healthy, and that means hay or pasture. It can
be frustrating to spend your money on hay or to slave over your pasture and
see it vanish so quickly, coming out the other end as loads of poop.
Because of this, one of the toughest aspects of horse ownership is resisting
the urge to buy cheap hay, graze on not-so-good pasture, or purchase low-
end grain or commercial feed. Horses are expensive, and horse owners often
look for any way they can to save money.
But saving money on your horse’s feed is pennywise and pound foolish. Your
horse won’t stay healthy if you don’t provide her with good nutrition. Not only
will her general condition suffer, but she may also become ill from eating hay
or grain that’s moldy, or pasture that’s contaminated with toxic weeds.
Always buy the best hay or grain that you can afford and that’s appropriate
for your individual horse’s needs, and work hard to keep your pasture
producing quality grass. For details on how to judge the quality of feed, 
see Chapter 7.
Keep Your Horse at an Optimum Weight
Nothing is sadder than seeing a horse who’s grossly underweight. Seeing
such a noble creature with all his bones protruding is incredibly depressing.
But just as depressing to those who know horses is seeing a horse who’s
grossly overweight. Fat horses have owners who mean well, giving them as
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

much food as they’ll eat in the hopes of keeping them happy. The result is an
animal whose joints and ligaments are being unnecessarily stressed, and
who’s at risk for laminitis. (See Chapter 11 for details on this disease.)
Use the guidelines in Chapter 7 to determine how much your horse should eat
every day. Keep a close eye on his weight, and if he’s getting too thin, ask
your veterinarian about the best way to increase his dietary intake. After a
physical exam to help rule out medical causes, your veterinarian can recom-
mend changing the amount of food that you give your horse or possibly a
change in type of food. If he’s getting too fat, reduce his grain intake and/or
increase his exercise. If you aren’t sure whether your horse is too fat or too
thin (or if you see changes in body condition despite food and exercise being
the same as before), check out Chapter 2 and consult with your veterinarian.
Keeping your horse at the optimum body weight increases his chances of
staying healthy throughout his life.
Use Joint Nutraceuticals
Although it hasn’t been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt in clinical studies,
anecdotal evidence has shown that joint nutraceuticals containing glucosamine,
chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) may help a horse’s
joints stay healthy.
You can find a vast array of products containing these ingredients in tack
stores, in equine product catalogs, and online. Selecting the best one can be
tricky because no real guidelines exist on how to pick these products. Ask
your veterinarian for guidance. He or she may have experience with some of
the products that are out there, and will most likely have an opinion on which
one you should use for the best results.
For more information on joint nutraceuticals, see Chapter 14.

Veterinary Teaching Hospitals
When you’re talking about state-of-the-art vet care, nothing compares to vet-
erinary teaching hospitals. These working hospitals are located within veterinary
schools, and you can find them around the country. They’re the source of the
latest in research on issues affecting equine care, and they employ specialists
who are up-to-date on all the latest treatments for horses. You can rely on these
hospitals for detailed information on just about any disease or condition affect-
ing horses. Your veterinarian may refer you to one of these hospitals if you live
within driving distance to one, or he or she may consult over the phone with a
specialist at one of these facilities.
