There are two kinds of arguments I have with
my PC. The most common is rather one-sided,
as I politely enquire why, of all times, it has
chosen to restart now, just as I was in the
middle of something more important than it
could ever comprehend. The other type is more
constructive. These ‘arguments’ are the
technical values that deﬁne how a computer
will perform a particular task.
In our Cover Feature, Jonathan Parkyn
explains how to use the second kind of
argument to schedule tasks on your PC. You
can order it to shut down and wake up at set
times, and even open your favourites websites
as soon as you log on. With the help of
software, you can also schedule it to remove
junk, perform a backup, and send an email at a
later date.
One thing on our schedule is the next
Computeractive Back Issue CD, containing all
26 issues from 2017 as searchable PDFs. We’ll
let you know when it’s on sale.

Huge processor flaws slow
down your PC and phone
What a great start to 2018!
The UK’s National Cyber
Security Centre said there’s
no evidence hackers are
using these ﬂaws to steal
data, but that’s of little
comfort because the attacks
would be diﬃcult to detect
anyway. The Meltdown
updates should be eﬀective,
but more worrying is Spectre,
which could take years to ﬁx
properly. Its complexity also
makes it hard for hackers to
exploit, though thousands
must be already trying.
Rarely has a ﬂaw been so
aptly named: Spectre will
haunt PCs for years.
COMMENT
page, containing ﬁxes for
blue-screen crashes: www.
snipca.com/26711.
Google also released a ﬁx
in early January, covering its
mobile operating system
Android. Any device that has
received a security update
dated 5 January or later is safe.
A Chrome update is due on
23 January, while Mozilla
protected Firefox with an
update to version 57.0.4.
On 4 January, Apple
updated iOS, the operating
system that runs on iPhones
and iPads, to version 11.2.
Make sure you’ve got it by
going to Settings, General,
Software Update on your
device.
E
very computing device
you own – PC, laptop,
phone and tablet – could
be slowed down by ﬁxes to
two processor ﬂaws that
have been described as
some of the worst
bugs ever found.
Tech companies have
been racing to ﬁx the ﬂaws,
called Meltdown and Spectre
by the researchers who
discovered them.
They aﬀect billions of
devices worldwide powered
by Intel, AMD, ARM and
Qualcomm processors. These
include Windows and Linux
computers, Android phones
and tablets, and iPhones and
iPads. The ﬂaws go so deep
that updates are not only
needed for processor ﬁrmware,
but also for browsers and
operating systems.
Intel pledged to release
updates in the second week of
January. These will be given to
manufacturers, who will add
them to your computer
through Windows Update. If
you built your own computer,
you’ll need to search for
updates on Intel or AMD’s
website, as well as from your
motherboard’s manufacturer.
Some experts expect these
ﬁxes to slow down computers
and other devices by up to 30
per cent, though Intel said
performance loss will depend
on what you do on the device.
The more software you use the
bigger the impact, though it
claimed the slowdown
“should not be signiﬁcant” for
average home computer users.
Speculative execution
Both ﬂaws aﬀect a practice
whereby processors – in
order to speed things up –
try to ‘guess’ what piece of
information a device needs
next. The technical term
for this is speculative
execution.
As the processor guesses,
it momentarily stores data
from other programs,
including sensitive
information such as passwords.
Meltdown, the most
pressing ﬂaw, lets attackers
access this information
through an operating system.
It aﬀects most Intel processors
made since 1995. Spectre,
which is more of a long-term
problem, allows hackers
to trigger speculative
execution in order to steal
important data.
Other updates you
need
As the scale of the problem
unfolded, there were fears
that every aﬀected device
would need to be replaced.
But some companies
responded quickly with ﬁxes.
Microsoft released an
update, called KB4056892,
on 3 January, and said more
ﬁxes are planned. However,
it warned that some
“incompatible” antivirus
programs are reacting to the
update by causing a Blue
Screen of Death crash.
Microsoft urged users
whose computers are crashing
to contact their antivirus
company. High-proﬁle
security programs reported to
clash with the update include
Norton, F-Secure and Avast.
Microsoft said aﬀected
antivirus companies will need
to update their software to
handle the update. The
company has published a help

The Government has pledged
to ban touts using automated
software to bulk-buy tickets
for concerts and sports events
advertised online.
Touts often use programs
called ‘bots’ to snap up tickets
in larger numbers than
websites technically allow.
They then oﬀer the tickets at
rip-oﬀprices on secondary-
ticketing websites such as
Viagogo and StubHub.
The Government has told
the European Commission it
intends to enshrine a ban in
law. It says a new criminal
oﬀence in the Digital Economy
Act will leave touts facing
unlimited ﬁnes for breaching
the rules.

DoyouuseanHPlaptop?Check
whetheritmightcatchfire
If you’ve bought an HP laptop
in the past two years you
should urgently check
whether its battery could
catch ﬁre.
The company said that some
laptops sold worldwide
between December 2015 and
December 2017 contain faults
that make them overheat. It
has recalled the models after
eight reports of batteries
“overheating, melting or
charring”, according to the
United States Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
One incident caused a
ﬁrst-degree burn.
Visit HP’s site to check
whether your laptop is at risk:
www.snipca.com/26700.

MICROSOFT EDGE IS
‘FASTER THAN CHROME’
Microsoft says its Edge
browser is 48 per cent faster
than Google Chrome, and
blocks 18 per cent more
phishing sites. The claims
appear in a new advert from
the company (www.snipca.
com/26681). Another advert
(www.snipca.com/26682)
boasts that Edge uses less
of a laptop’s battery when
playing videos. It quotes a
test run by Microsoft showing
that Edge lasted for over 16
hours, beating Chrome’s 13
hours, 31 minutes.
REPEAT OFFENDERS USE
PHONE WHILE DRIVING
Many motorists are
repeatedly using phones
while driving despite being
caught, new ﬁgures from
the DVLA show. More
than 6,000 were stopped
at least twice for driving
while distracted, over 400
three times, and 20 drivers
four times. The RAC said
responsible motorists will be
“shocked” by the numbers,
adding that repeat oﬀenders
believe there is “little
chance of seeing a traﬃc
police oﬃcer”.
IN BRIEF
winning US musical Hamilton
(pictured above) were re-sold
for £6,000 last year.
Hamilton’s producers are
trying to beat the touts by
using a paperless ticket system
that requires the ticket
purchaser to present their
credit card when they arrive
at the theatre.
Recent concerts by the
singers Adele and Ed Sheeran
have also been targeted by
touts. Last year, an £85 ticket
to see Adele at London’s O2
venue was being oﬀered for
£24,840.
Matt Hancock, the minister
for the creative industries,
said: “We’re determined to
make sure 2018 is the year
we help real fans get the
chance to see their favourite
music and sports stars at a
fair price”.
The move is part of a
growing movement aimed at
preventing ticket touts from
exploiting fans online. In
November last year Google
said sites reselling tickets
would need to seek its
approval before advertising in
search results. Sites must also
disclose that prices may be
higher than the face value.

If this tool identiﬁes a
dangerous battery, it will issue
a BIOS update and the laptop
will reboot. You’ll be asked to
accept Battery Safety Mode,
which will let you safely use
your laptop by plugging it into
the mains, rather than using
the combustible batteries.
HP says the batteries are
internal and can’t be replaced
by users, so it will provide
“battery replacement services
by an authorized technician at
no cost”. It added that the
fault “pertains to 0.1 per cent
of the HP systems sold globally
over the past two years”.
This is the second time in 18
months that HP has warned
about dangerous laptops. In
June 2016 it recalled 41,000 of
them, expanding this to
101,000 in January 2017. Read

Justsendatextundernewrules
Switching your phone
network will be as easy
as sending a text, under
new Ofcom rules.
The regulator said
that from July 2019
you’ll only need to send
your existing mobile
network a text to tell
them you’re leaving.
They must reply
immediately with a PAC
(Porting Authorisation
Code), which you have
to give to your new
network within 30 days.
Their text must also
include any outstanding
costs that you owe, any
pay-as-you-go credit
you have, and whether
you need to pay termination
fees. Switching must then take
place within one working day.
Currently, if you want to
switch you have to speak to
your provider, which gives
them the chance to try to
persuade you to stay. Ofcom
says the changes mean
you’ll always avoid these
“unwanted attempts” to keep
you as a customer.
However, you’ll still be able
to cancel by calling your
provider if that’s what you
prefer. You’ll also have to
speak to them if you don’t
want to keep your number.
Over the next 18 months
mobile companies will work
together to set up a new
switching system. They will
have to agree on the codes
sent to customers.
Ofcom claims
switching will be so
“quick and easy” that
customers will be able
to request their code
while looking for a new
deal, such as when
shopping on the
high street.
The regulator says
reform is urgently
needed because
research shows that
38 per cent of people
who tried to switch –
2.5 million people –
have experienced major
problems.
The new rules will
also ban mobile
companies from charging
customers after the switch
date. This will put to an end
people paying for old and new
services at the same time.
Ofcom estimates this will save
customers around £10 million
each year.

British spies have substantially
increased their hacking
powers in recent years, an
oﬃcial report has said.
The annual report from the
Intelligence and Security
Committee said GCHQ had
“over-achieved” in building
tools that let them hack
criminals and terrorists. More
than double the number of
cyber-weapons had been
developed than expected. It
added that GCHQ’s new digital
arsenal is on a “diﬀerent scale”
to what it previously possessed.
Some of these tools could be
used to ward oﬀattacks from
states like China, Iran, North
Korea and Russia, or threaten
retaliation that could target
their infrastructure.
UK spies build stronger hacking weapons
Super-fastWi-Fiontrains,butnot
until2025
Rail passengers have been
promised a “world-class”
internet and 5G mobile
service, but will have to wait
until 2025 to enjoy it.
Under new Government
plans, ﬁbre-optic cables could
be laid along tracks and
through tunnels, and wireless
transmitters placed on mobile
masts. The Government said
speeds could reach 1Gbps,
fast enough to let “everyone
onboard stream videos
simultaneously”.
At present, internet and
mobile signals are supplied by
phone networks, meaning
they are often patchy and
even non-existent in some
remote areas.
Transport Secretary Chris
Grayling said it was part of the
Government’s pledge to deliver
“the biggest rail improvement
plan since Victorian times”.
He added: “Improved
mobile connectivity will help
passengers to keep up with
work, connect with friends or
even check the latest journey
information online while on
the move”.
Bruce Williamson, from
passenger campaign group
Railfuture (https://railfuture.
org.uk), welcomed the
plans, saying that “seamless
connectivity” should be
standard on all trains.
“Very soon, trains without
Wi-Fi will become unthinkable,
and rail passengers will look
forward to the day when the
phone doesn’t cut out in
tunnels,” he added.
But senior MPs questioned
why it would take another
seven years. Damian Collins,
Conservative chair of the
Culture Committee, said:
“I would prefer this to be a
backstop date and we will be
able to deliver it much quicker
than that. I don’t know why it
should take this long”.
Work is already under
way on a trial on the trans-
Pennine route between
Manchester and York, in
partnership with Network
Rail. It’s part of the
Government’s £31bn National
Productivity Investment
Fund, announced by
Chancellor Philip Hammond
in the 2016 Autumn Budget.
The Government will now
consult on how the upgrades
will be funded. Read its
proposal on Gov.uk at

noisy adverts that play

NOKIA MAKING 4G
RETRO PHONE
Nokia is making a 4G version
of its retro 3310 phone,
according to documents
leaked online. The £50 phone,
launched in 2G and 3G
editions last year, is a
modern remake of the
classic design, which sold
over 120 million between
2000 and 2005. Reports
say the new 3310 will be a
ble to run the hugely popular
messaging service WhatsApp.
REPORT CRIMES USING
AMAZON ECHO
Police in Lancashire will
soon start delivering daily
bulletins through the
Amazon Echo smart
speaker. Rob Flanagan from
Lancashire Constabulary
said that by the end of
January news about crimes
will be sent to users’
phones, which synchronise
with their Echo. He added
that in the
following months
the device will be
able to answer
questions such as
‘How do I report
this crime?’.
IN BRIEF
In 2015, the Government
outlined ambitious plans to
boost GCHQ’s hacking
abilities, which it deﬁned as
the power to “disrupt, deny,
degrade or destroy computer
networks and internet-
connected devices”.
But not all projects have
been successful. GCHQ
admitted that a project to
hack encryption used by
enemies has been delayed due
to a skills shortage. Codenamed
Foxtrot, the project is GCHQ’s
“number one priority and
number one worry”.
The report was released in
late December, a day after the
White House and the Foreign
Oﬃce both publicly blamed
North Korea for the Wannacry
ransomware attack, which
devastated NHS computers
in May last year.
North Korea’s Ministry of
Foreign Aﬀairs called the
accusation “absurd”. A
spokesman said: “Crystal clear
is the purpose of the US to try

has the ability to – and I quote –
“read and change all your data on
the websites that you visit”.
That ought to scare the hell out of
you, because it means you’ve just
handed over an absolute treasure
trove of personal information to the
extension’s developer. There’s no
way of knowing what they might do
with all your private data, but the
deceptive way the software sneaks
on to your system in the ﬁrst place
doesn’t auger well. It doesn’t help
that EagleGet is based in China, far away
from the data-protection rules we take
for granted.
If you like the idea of a download
manager, give EagleGet a miss and try
something like Free Download Manager
(www.freedownloadmanager.org). It
doesn’t look very slick, but it won’t try to
install junk on your system.
Junk oﬀender: EagleGet
I’m a bit of a magpie when it comes
to software downloads, so I’ve been
trying out a free download manager
called EagleGet. It features multi-
threaded downloading, to make
your ﬁles come down the line faster,
and interrupted downloads can be
seamlessly resumed. So far, so good.
Unfortunately, that’s not all it
does. When you install EagleGet,
you’re invited to add a Chrome
extension called EagleGet iNewTab,
with no explanation of what this is. I
assumed it was part of the download
manager, and installed it without a
second thought.
Big mistake. Huge, in fact. The
extension replaces Chrome’s familiar
‘New Tab’ page with a garish canvas,
packed with ugly buttons and cryptic
icons (see screenshot). It’s confusing to
say the least, and the Google search bar is
replaced by Yahoo, so your web searches
don’t work the way you’re used to either.
That’s not the most disturbing thing
though. iNewTab also shows how many
unread Facebook notiﬁcations and Gmail
messages are sitting in your inbox. How
does it know this? Well, if you dig into
the settings you’ll see that this extension

Question
ofthe
Fortnight
I
n early January, as the NHS
cancelled all non-urgent
operations amid increased
pressure, an innovative trial
was announced that may
herald a brighter future for
the service. John Radcliﬀe
Hospital in Oxford said it
will start using artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) to help
diagnose early signs of heart
disease. Experts say it could
save the NHS hundreds of
millions every year.
The system, called Ultromics
(pictured), was developed by
Paul Leeson, Professor of
Cardiovascular Medicine at
Oxford University. He taught it
to recognise heart disease by
feeding it 1,000 heart scans of
patients from the last seven
years. He also told it whether
the patient went on to develop
heart problems. It uses this
information as a baseline to
predict and diagnose the scans
of new patients.
Professor Leeson said this
method, which has been
tested in six cardiology units,
shows signs of being much
more accurate than human
diagnosis. The current
approach, in which
cardiologists check the timing
of the heartbeat, is far from
perfect. Of the 60,000 heart
scans carried out each year,
around a ﬁfth are
misdiagnosed. Patients are
either sent home and have a
heart attack, or undergo an
operation they don’t need.
These errors cost the NHS
around £600m a year.
The trial results will be
published later this year in a
medical journal. If successful,
the system will be made
available for free to NHS
hospitals across the country.
Professor Leeson said: “As
cardiologists, we accept that
we don’t always get it right.
But now there is a possibility
we may be able to do better”.
Another new system could
deliver breakthroughs in
diagnosing lung cancer.
Developed by Oxford-based
company Optellum, it checks
scans for clumps of cells called
nodules, which may be
cancerous. It can’t yet
diagnose cancer, though it can
rule out harmless cases earlier
than doctors can. Optellum’s
chief science and technology
oﬃcer, Dr Timor Kadir, says
the system could free up
enough medical resources to
give 4,000 extra patients an
early screening, boosting their
chances of survival.
Worldwide, there’s plenty of
evidence of AI’s potential,
from US researchers using it
to spot signs of schizophrenia
in brain scans, to Japanese
scientists identifying bowel
cancer from colonoscopies.
Dr Kadir says the focus for
using AI in the NHS shouldn’t
be about saving money, but
instead looking at “how to
oﬀer better healthcare to more
people for the same
proportion of GDP”. However,
geneticist Sir John Bell, the
Government’s healthcare tsar,
said: “There is about £2.2bn
spent on pathology services in
the NHS. You may be able to
reduce that by 50 per cent. AI
may be the thing that saves
the NHS”.
His optimism is shared by
NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens, who has said
Willartificialintelligence
savetheNHS?
Computers can now diagnose faster and better than humans
A fifth of the 60,000 heart
scans carried out each year by
doctors are misdiagnosed
the service will invest more of
its £120bn budget in AI.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt
also sees AI playing a bigger
part in the NHS, saying that by
2028 computers could be
diagnosing conditions before
the patient has developed
symptoms. There are already
plans to use AI to analyse
X-rays and tissue samples.
AI isn’t a silver bullet for the
NHS, of course. But the money
it saves could be spent
tackling long-term NHS
problems, such as obesity and
an ageing population. Smarter
technology may mean no
more winter crises.
• A new artiﬁcial-intelligence
system is being used to
diagnose heart problems
• Errors in diagnosing heart
disease cost the NHS
around £600m every year
• The Government’s health
tsar says AI could cut some
NHS costs by 50 per cent

that the Echo Dot is the best present I’ve
ever bought her. She loves asking it
questions to test its knowledge, and
seeking information from the web. The
curious thing is that until now my
mother has shied away from technology.
Even though they are connected to the
web, devices like the Echo aren’t really
computing gadgets at all. Because they
are voice-controlled, they bypass all the
diﬃculties that people associate with
computers. Everyone should buy one -

Sat-navs as distracting

We all know it’s naughty and
dangerous to use our phones while
driving. It can be expensive too if caught.
However, how many of us realise that
where we position our phone holders,
sat-navs and safety cameras can be just as
distracting or worse?

Facebookers
Am I the only reader of your
magazine not on Facebook? At
work I can’t ‘talk’ to others at my break
because everyone is Facebooking. At
breakfast time in Premier Inns and in
eating places at night I am surrounded by
Facebookers. I stand in a queue to order
food and the person ordering in front of
me pauses the order to ‘like’ somebody.
A guy with a coﬀee in one hand and
Facebook in the other trips over my
wife’s wheelchair footplates and looks at
me as if I’d trod in something. Why build

them feel inferior to you?
People who know the real me

Use local banks or lose them
Having just read the Star Letter by
Len Bradshaw (Issue 518) about
online banking, I have to agree with him
about the importance of face-to-face
interaction with the counter staﬀ.
Some time ago I booked a holiday on
the high street with a major tour
operator. After booking it, the girl said I
could have got it a little cheaper online. I
answered yes, but if we all did that you
would be out of a job. “I never thought
about that,” she said. If I book in store
and something goes wrong, I can go back
to the store and talk it over. If you book
online you have to sort it out online. I had
the same conversation in my bank. I can
bank online if I have to, but we need the
outlets. As they say, ‘use it or lose it’.
Alan Merser
Len Bradshaw paints a rosy picture
of local bank branches, but my
local community has actually been
boosted by their closure. Over the years
fewer and fewer people were using them,
choosing online services instead. Where
an old HSBC and Barclays once stood
now stand two high-street coﬀee chains.
You might think the coﬀee has daft
names and is expensive, and you’d
probably be right. But the stores are also
comfortable places to sit and socialise.
I’m a member of three groups who meet
weekly over a coﬀee and a muﬃn. They
are also, ironically perhaps, excellent
places to browse the web. I sometimes
feel a twinge of nostalgia for local banks,
but times change, and so do people’s
habits.

Facebook ‘ripping society apart’?
Hysterical nonsense!
worldwide crisis.
Also, I’m very
sceptical that fake
news is really that big
a problem. I think the
Facebook-haters are
so worried about it
simply because it
allegedly led to two
events they didn’t
approve of, namely the
Brexit referendum
vote and the election
of Donald Trump.
Would they be so
concerned if the results
had gone the other way?
The fuss about Facebook being an
echo chamber is also overblown.
There’s nothing new about people
seeking the opinion of like-minded
people. It’s why we buy newspapers
with columnists we agree with.
What puzzles me is why Facebook’s
former employees lament its success. I
suspect they hate the fact that it’s used
by millions of people they don’t
approve of. Their hysterical nonsense
reeks of snobbery.
Len Forshaw
I’m ancient enough
to have lived
through many moral
hysterias. I remember
when everyone thought
rock’n’roll would bring
about the end of
civilisation. Then it was
mods and rockers,
followed by punk
rockers. A few years
later computer games
were the devil’s work,
then it was video
nasties. When mobile
phones arrived, people
worried they would fry their brains.
Any new technology always gets
criticised for having a malign inﬂuence
on people, which is why I’m fairly
relaxed about concerns that Facebook
is “ripping society apart” (‘Question of
the Fortnight’, Issue 518).
Facebook is simply the latest target of
self-appointed moral guardians, who
always hate it when they can’t control
what the great unwashed masses use.
People may not be as nice online as
they are face to face, but it’s a fatuous
overreaction to say this represents a

about a device of about 60 square
centimetres stuck in the same critical
area?
I’ve seen people peering over the top of
their sat-nav-enabled phones, which are
right in their line of sight. Arms ﬂailing
over the steering wheel, trying to prod a
touchscreen, is not a good idea.
My favourite one was the young lady
reaching to retrieve her charger cable
from the passenger footwell to plug into
her device. Her car looked like one of
those driverless things for a while. OK,
we were only creeping along in traﬃc at
the time, but she must have wrapped it
around her indicator stalk about three
times before she got it plugged in.
My camera is mostly tucked away
behind the mirror and I use a power
bank to keep it running on longer trips.
The power bank ﬁts in the roof-mounted
glasses storage and negates the need for a
cable trailing over the dash (another
distraction).
Next time you are out, have a look at
the crazy places people put these things.
You’ll be amazed (unless it’s your car).
Happy gadget-distracted motoring.

iPhone update flushes
battery life down toilet
I am an iPhone owner who cannot
aﬀord the ridiculous (in my
opinion) £1,000 for the iPhone X so, I
bought a reconditioned iPhone 5s
instead. I recently replaced the battery
myself and reaped the
beneﬁts immediately. I
understood that this was
done oﬀmy own back and
if anything went wrong I’d
have no complaints.
Contrary to reports that
this was a complicated
process, I found it quite
easy to do by following a
helpful YouTube video.
So what could be the
problem? I downloaded
the latest iOS update (version 11.2.1) as
we are advised to do to remain safe.
That’s where the success story turns bad.
This update has almost rendered the
phone useless. The battery life has gone
down the toilet. So what options do I
have? Well, according to the Apple
forums (https://discussions.
apple.com), one solution is
to upgrade my phone, but I
can’t aﬀord that. Another
option is to take my iPhone
to an Apple Store and pay
them more than £90 for a
new battery and installation,
even though the battery is
only a couple of months old.
It seems that Apple don’t
want my kind of custom.

Cheap printer inks make
photos fade
In his letter about printer inks in
Issue 516, Ray Moss says that
“modern cheap alternatives are as good
as originals”. Well I can assure him they
are nothing like the original inks, which I
have found out to my cost.
One of my hobbies is photography and
I have a top-of-the-range Canon DSLR
camera. I also use a Canon Pixma printer.
Because I print lots of pictures at various
sizes I use a lot of printer inks, and have
tried lots of suppliers to keep the costs
down. Here’s where I have come unstuck,
because after using some inks from
Amazon (very, very cheaply) I was
horriﬁed to ﬁnd that the photos I’d
printed were fading!

Should I return faulty phone to
the manufacturer or retailer?
Q
I bought a Motorola Moto G5S
phone from Debenhams Plus
(www.debenhamsplus.com)
on 24 September 2017, but after a
couple of weeks the screen started
going blank when I was making and
receiving calls. I tried removing apps
and resetting the phone, but nothing
worked. Debenhams advised me to
contact Motorola because it would be
quicker to get a repair, and told me I’d
have to pay to return it. But Motorola
says I have to return it via Debenhams.
Is this acceptable?
Andy Armitage
A
It appears Motorola and
Debenhams are trying to use
the manufacturer’s warranty
to get this phone repaired so, no, this
isn’t acceptable.
Generally, you shouldn’t use a
warranty to seek redress for inherently
faulty products unless there’s no
way of forcing the retailer to take
responsibility – such as they’ve gone
bust or it’s diﬃcult to prove the fault
is inherent.
By using the warranty you’re letting
the retailer argue that you’ve not let it
use its rights to carry out one repair, as
allowed under the Consumer Rights
Act (CRA). So if Andy sent the phone
directly back to Motorola, and it wasn’t
ﬁxed properly or another fault shows
up, Debenhams would be entitled to
oﬀer another repair.
Our advice to Andy is to return the
phone to Debenhams, and tell the
company he won’t be paying for the
delivery. The terms and conditions of
Motorola’s warranty do state that the
customer must pay to return items, but
Andy should cite the CRA, which says
consumers must not be out of pocket if
they’ve been lumbered with inherently
faulty goods. So if Debenhams won’t
supply a pre-paid label or send a
courier once the inherent
fault has been proven, it
must refund Andy the
delivery costs.
Q
It was immediately obvious that
an Asus laptop I’d bought was
faulty because it failed to boot
properly. But the retailer, Hughes TV and
Electrical (www.hughes.co.uk), said that
legally it didn’t have to replace it. They
blamed my internet connection for the
problems. Can you help?
Carl Hughes
A
Hopefully, we won’t have to,
because since ﬁrst emailing us
Carl got back in touch to say that
he has ﬁnally convinced Hughes that the
PC is broken. The company says it will
pick up the PC and refund him.
Hughes should have already picked up
this PC, of course. Within the ﬁrst 30
days after purchase, if goods appear to be
inherently faulty, the consumer can reject
them, choosing a replacement or refund.
But Hughes doesn’t have to refund him
straightaway. Within six months retailers
are entitled to test whether a fault is
inherent. It must carry out these tests
within a ‘reasonable’ time, which is the
kind of ambiguous wording that can
frustrate consumers. There’s no deﬁnitive
time limit for tests, but
generally longer than
four weeks would be
considered unreasonable.
Can a retailer
refuse to help in
the first 30 days?
A
You can claim under the CCA for
faulty goods paid for with a gift
card or voucher that’s been
bought with a credit card. John’s problem
is he only paid £100 for the gift card and
£67.36 for the external drive. Section 75
claims can only be made if a single
purchase costs a minimum of £100.01.
However, Amazon has agreed to examine
John’s claim. This is a goodwill gesture,
because John is outside the 90 days
allowed by the site’s ‘A-z Buyer Protection’.
But John is well within the six-month
deadline to return an inherently faulty
product without having to prove it’s
defective. We’ve said this to Digimedia,
and are waiting for a reply. The company
will be allowed to test the drive, but if it
can’t show that it was damaged
by user error, it will have
to refund John, repair the
drive, or replace it.
Q
In Issue 516 you mentioned
the lack of protection that is
oﬀered by Section 75 of the
Consumer Credit Act (CCA) when
using third-party payment providers
such as PayPal. An Amazon Marketplace
seller called Digimedia refused to
replace a defective external hard drive
I’d paid for with an Amazon gift
card. Its reason was that, like PayPal,
gift cards are not covered by the
CCA. Is there another way I can get
a refund?

But a new contract begins
every year, when the
subscription is renewed.
So as long as he hasn’t downloaded
the software since this date, he
can cancel.
In addition, Magix’s terms and
conditions don’t sit well with changes
brought in by the Consumer Rights Act
(2015), which considers lengthy
cancellation-notice periods (such as the
eight weeks that Magix asks for) and
insuﬃcient reminders about an
upcoming renewal as unfair.
Hopefully, newer and even clearer
protection is on the way. In last year’s
Spring Budget, Chancellor Philip
Hammond announced proposals to
“protect consumers from facing
unexpected payments when a
subscription is renewed or when a free
trial ends”. It remains unclear, though,
what form this greater protection
will take.

Epson ends reader’s torment by
refunding in full
It sometimes seems
that companies toy
with customers like
a cat torments a wounded bird. In
Issue 517 we reported how Martin
Day’s sanity was being tested
by Epson, which was offering a
refund one day, then withdrawing
it the next. In despair, he turned
to us, explaining that Epson had failed
to repair his printer, then sent him two
replacements that didn’t work.
After the first printer broke Martin wanted a refund. But
because more than 30 days had passed since purchase, Epson
was entitled to try to repair it. What it wasn’t allowed to do was
subject Martin to further repairs and replacements. Instead, it
should have refunded Martin when the first repair failed.
Happily, it has now agreed to give Martin his money back.
We were confident of a partially successful outcome, but not
necessarily that Martin would get a refund for the full RRP,
which was £309. This is because he used a £75 cashback deal
from Epson to cut the price to £234. However, Epson did refund
him the full amount, which we think is fair because Martin
easily spent £75 on wasted ink cartridges. Martin thanked us
for helping him, adding: “I was beginning to lose all hope in
rectifying this”.

What’s the threat?
Scammers pretending to be phoning
from HMRC are conning elderly and
vulnerable people by saying that the
only way to pay a “large” tax bill is to
buy digital vouchers and gift cards,
including those for iTunes.
Victims are instructed to go and buy
the vouchers from a local shop, then
read out the redemption code to the
scammer, who has stayed on the
phone. They then spend the codes,
or sell them.
It’s not a new tactic, but just before
Christmas HMRC issued a warning
that it continues to “hit a large
number of people”, with incidences
rising in recent months. Between
January 2016 and August 2017 there
were 1,500 reports of the scam. Most
victims are aged over 65, and lose an
average of £1,150.
HMRC added that
the scammers are
extremely aggressive,
frequently using
“intimidation to get
what they want,
threatening to seize
the victim’s property
or involve the police”. HMRC’s Director
General of Customer Services, Angela
MacDonald, said they were “very
conﬁdent, convincing and utterly
ruthless”.
How can you stay safe?
If you receive a phone call from HMRC
scammers, hang up straight away and
report it to HMRC (email: phishing@
hmrc.gsi.gov.uk), and Action Fraud on
0300 123 2040 or at www.snipca.

BCUninstaller 4.1
www.snipca.com/26666
What you need: Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10
1 To uninstall multiple
programs, hold down
the Ctrl button and
click the ones you want
to remove, then click
Uninstall. You’ll see a
conﬁrmation screen –
click Continue (twice),
then Begin Uninstallation.
2 To uninstall programs
automatically, so you don’t
have to see conﬁrmation
screens for each one, select
the programs you want to
remove from the list and
click ‘Uninstall quietly’,
Continue (twice), then Begin
Uninstallation.
3 The new treemap
displays all installed
programs by size – bigger
blocks represent larger
programs. For more
information, right-click a
block and select Properties
to see a window with more
details.
4 Click the Tools menu for
some useful options,
including a Startup
Manager and a ‘Clean up
“Program Files” folders’
tool, which searches for
and removes ﬁles, folders
and other junk left over
from uninstallations.
UNINSTALLER
Our current favourite free uninstaller is Wise Program
Uninstaller (www.snipca.com/26667), which won a Gold
Award in our last group test of uninstallers (see Issue 504,
page 50). But if you want more advanced features and
customisation options, then we wouldn’t blame you for trying
BCUninstaller instead.
It might look more daunting at ﬁrst glance than Wise’s
uninstaller, and it might have a rude name (BC stands for
‘Bulk Crap’). But BCUninstaller is an undeniably powerful
tool that gives you total control over both traditional desktop
programs and Windows Store apps.
BCUninstaller lets you uninstall multiple programs at the
same time, for example, and installed software is presented
using a colour-coded view that makes it easy to see what type
of program each one is. Every program is listed along with
plenty of useful information – not just the install date and
size, but also the version number, whether there’s a related
startup item and any associated registry keys. The brand new
version of BCUninstaller adds even more advanced features,
including a new treemap under the main program list that
shows installed programs by size. You can now safely
automate bulk uninstallations, so that you don’t have to click
through dozens of conﬁrmation screens. It also automatically
detects related software when uninstalling and asks if you
want to uninstall them as well.
Download BCUninstaller from the link above. You’ll notice
there are two options – download the portable version if you
want to run the program without installing anything, or
download the ‘Installer and Portable’ version, which will give
you the option of installing BCUninstaller or running its
portable version when you launch it.
The ﬁrst time you run BCUninstaller, you’ll see instructions
that let you conﬁgure some of its settings – language, layout
and so on. Don’t worry too much about these – the default
selections are ﬁne, and you can always change them at a later
point by clicking Tools, then Settings.

MUSIC PLAYER
http://plexamp.com
What you need: Windows 7, 8/8.1
or 10 (64bit only)
If you use media-streaming tool
Plex, you should try this new
experimental program from its
developers. Like Station (see
below), Plexamp is a 64bit-only
program. It’s a compact music
player inspired by classic media
programs such as WinAmp. It lets you play tracks from your
Plex library via a tiny window on your desktop, complete with
album art and lyrics. You can ﬁnd speciﬁc artists, tracks or
albums via the Search box. But Plexamp is all about
rediscovering forgotten tunes from your music library, so you
can also choose one of three ‘radios’. Library Radio plays
random tracks across your whole collection, Time Travel Radio
plays your oldest tracks ﬁrst and Artist Radio plays tunes similar
to your initial selection.
https://getstation.com
What you need: Windows 7, 8/8.1 or 10 (64bit only)
Station is a very interesting new tool that lets you access
dozens of online tools – including Google Docs, WhatsApp,
Dropbox and more – from within a single tabbed ‘workstation’
interface, rather than via several diﬀerent apps and browser
windows. It’s primarily targeted at business users but anyone
can use Station – as long as you have a newer 64bit computer.
One great way to use Station is to unite all your online storage
accounts. You’ll be prompted to ‘Log in with your work
account’ when you ﬁrst run the tool, but you can simply log in
with a Google account. Once you’ve done that, shortcuts to
your Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar will magically
appear on the left. Click the plus (+) sign at the bottom left
to browse for and add other apps. Click the ‘Storage &
File-sharing’ category, for example, to add Box, Dropbox,
OneDrive and more.

Q
Could you please tell me of a good free program
for touching up old photos? I’d like one that can
add hair to your head and hide wrinkles.
Malcolm J Reid
A
Removing blemishes and retouching portrait
photos can be done with many decent free image-
editing programs, including Paint.net (www.
getpaint.net). Open your photo and zoom into the area you
want to retouch. To remove a wrinkle, click the Clone Brush
(rubber stamp) tool on the left. Hold down the Ctrl key and
click a smooth section of skin adjacent to the wrinkle, then
release Ctrl and click the wrinkle. Continue doing this until
the entire wrinkle is hidden. Use the Undo button to correct
mistakes. The same technique can be used in Gimp (www.
gimp.org) and other image-editing tools.
You may be able to use a similar trick to replace missing
hair, but this can be a little harder to get right. Try adjusting
the ‘Brush width’ and Hardness levels in the toolbar directly
above the main preview area to see if that helps.
If that all sounds like too much hard work, you could
consider a face-tuning app on your phone or tablet. These
are designed to improve portraits and selﬁes using simple,
touch-control tools. Facetune for Android (www.snipca.
com/26670) and iOS (www.snipca.com/26669) oﬀers a
Smooth tool that lets you swipe away any oﬀending
wrinkles with your ﬁnger, and a Patch tool that lets you
copy areas – such as hair – and place them somewhere else.
But this fountain of youth comes at a price: £3.99 to be
exact. There are free alternatives, but in-app purchases are
often required to unlock the best tools. The smoothing tools
included with Facetune 2 for iOS (www.snipca.com/26671)
and AirBrush for Android (www.snipca.com/26672) are
currently free, though.

but there’s a very handy set on the side,
too, where they’re easier to reach,
including USB 3.1, an SD card reader and
a headphone jack. As well as an HDMI
output for a second monitor, there’s an
HDMI input, so you can use the built-in
screen with another PC – an enormously
useful feature that’s too often omitted
(particularly by Apple).
Annoyingly, although 802.11ac Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth 4.1 are built in, the
included wireless keyboard and mouse
require a separate wireless dongle, taking
up one of the three USB 2.0 ports – but
that still leaves plenty, including a
USB Type-C. The keyboard wasn’t our
favourite for typing, so you might want
to sacriﬁce the coordinated look for
something less spongy.
All-in-one PCs tend to be either
overpriced or compromised, and overall
this is one of the better eﬀorts we’ve seen.
We’d hope for a processor upgrade soon
to make it a really solid buy.
Compared to Dell’s bigger and pricier
XPS 27 all-in-one (see our review, Issue
517), the 24in Inspiron looks more
restrained and businesslike. Instead of
an in-your-face multi-speaker grille, you
get a neat, dark grey front with elegantly
slim bezels and a more conventional
grille below the screen, through which
the built-in audio sounds decent.
With its white back panel and matching
accessories, the Inspiron 24 looks
attractive for a relatively aﬀordable PC,
and the 24in size is big enough for you to
work and watch ﬁlms comfortably while
ﬁtting the snuggest of studies.
The range starts at a reasonable £699
with a Full HD screen, AMD A10-9700E
quad-core processor and 1TB hard drive.
We tested the top model, though, which
came with a touchscreen that could be
laid ﬂat using the hinged stand supplied.
The touchscreen is standard on this and
the £829 mid-range conﬁguration, which
both have the faster AMD A12-9800E
processor. However, the clever stand costs
extra, and Dell is not currently selling it
in the UK yet anyway. We’re not really
bothered, given that anyone who wanted
to use their PC like that would probably
require a pressure-sensing stylus, which
isn’t oﬀered. In fact, we’d have preferred
the choice of saving a few quid by
skipping the touch feature altogether. But
the price is also justiﬁed by a 128GB SSD,
which comes in addition to the hard
drive for faster Windows startup and
loading, and a 4GB AMD Radeon RX460
graphics card.
That means most 3D games will run
smoothly, give or take a bit of ﬁddling
with quality settings for the most
demanding. The main processor is the
weak point, coming from the previous
generation of AMD chips, before the
impressive new Ryzen series, and
performing similarly to a low-end Intel
Core i3. Despite the four cores, we found
multi-tasking was slow, so although
everyday tasks didn’t pose any problem,
the system didn’t feel as nippy as we’d
have hoped for the money. If games aren’t
your thing, and you don’t need a
dedicated graphics card to speed up
video eﬀects, the £699 model could oﬀer
a better balance of price and performance.
We can’t comment on the quality
of that machine’s screen, but the
touchscreen on ours looked ﬁne,
covering 91.4 per cent of the sRGB
colour range, according to our meter,
with high accuracy. Brightness and
contrast are modest, and this wouldn’t be
our ﬁrst choice for serious photo editing,
but colours are punchy enough
regardless of viewing angle, and for
general tasks it won’t disappoint.
Like other all-in-one PCs, the Inspiron
24 has most of its connectors on the back,

battery life
2017 was the year the ‘two-in-one’ PC – a
laptop that folds into a tablet – began to
look less like an unwanted novelty and
more like something we’d genuinely
want. That’s partly because a laptop can
now be made slim and light enough
not to feel ridiculous
when wielded as a
tablet with the
keyboard still
attached. Windows 10 must
share the credit, too, for oﬀering a Tablet
mode and Windows Ink features that
make switching from keyboard to
touchscreen feel natural.
The Yoga 920 embodies these virtues.
Starting at a penny under twelve hundred
quid, it’s not cheap, but you can see
where all of those other pennies have
gone. Lenovo’s all-metal case – available
in copper, bronze or platinum-coloured
ﬁnishes – combines matt and polished
surfaces for a strikingly upmarket feel.
With its ‘watchband’ hinge, an intricate
yet sturdy construction that holds the
screen at whatever angle you choose, the
whole machine feels like it would be
more at home in the window of Tiﬀany’s
than Currys. A nearly-14in screen is
squeezed into less volume than many
13in laptops, and the designers have still
found room for two Thunderbolt-

ticking over. Our pricier test laptop went
one better with an i7-8550U and twice
the SSD storage, at 512GB. We’ve noted
before that this chip is a big step up in
performance, and in our tests the Yoga
920 scored as well as many seventh-
generation i5 desktop PCs in demanding
tasks. Just as importantly, it eked almost
12-and-a-half hours of video playback

That’s two hours more than Microsoft’s

watercooling?
What does it do?
Every PC needs to dissipate the heat
generated by its major components,
particularly the main processor (CPU)
and graphics processor (GPU). This is
most often done by air cooling – fans
at the front draw air
into the case, and fans
at the top, rear or sides
push it out, carrying the
excess heat with it. With
water cooling, you’ll
still need fans, but by
pumping water on to the back
of a metal plate ﬁxed directly to the hot
component, and circulating this water
to a radiator that helps heat escape,
cooling is made more eﬃcient.
Why would I want it?
It means you can get away with fewer
fans rotating at slower speeds while still
letting the chips reach their maximum
performance level – especially
important if they are overclocked. That
makes for a quieter computer.
What’s the catch?
Installing a water-cooling system can
be a complicated plumbing job, with
pipes to run around inside the case,
pumps and reservoirs, and multiple
joints with the risk of leaks.
So can I do without it?
Yes. Very few PCs really need a full-
blown water-cooling system – it’s more
of an aesthetic option for those who
want an impressive-looking computer,
typically accompanied by colour-
controlled LED lighting (see the Cube
Aorus PC pictured above). But ‘closed
loop’ water-cooling units – like Cooler
Master’s MasterLiquid Pro 140 –pictured
below) come with everything sealed in,
and although they’re ﬁddly to ﬁt, they
won’t need any maintenance or topping
up. So if a PC comes with one ﬁtted, like
the Palicomp AMD
Galaxy (see page
23), it’s a valid
choice that shouldn’t
cause you any
problems.

MESH ROUTER ❘£380 from Amazon www.snipca.com/26632
Better broadband for bigger budgets
17 – 30 January 2018
back
back
t
Mesh routers (see Issue 518, page 58)
have quickly become the best choice in
Wi-Fi for most homes. Supplied as a set
of two or more boxes, they add on to
your existing broadband equipment and
spread the signal wider, using clever
new technologies to ensure all your
devices get the best connection. That
includes those that use Wi-Fi and those
with a wired Ethernet port.
The latter can be cabled to one of the
two sockets on each of the Asus Lyra’s
three puck-shaped units, a little bigger
than a stack of 10 CDs. BT’s rival Whole
Home WiFi dishes only have one
Ethernet apiece. Then again, they are
compatible with BT Sport, if you have it
– unlike Lyra.
As usual, there’s a free app that
you’ll need on your phone or tablet to
set up the system, after which you can
also use a web page to change its
settings. These include the option to run
it in PPPoE mode to replace an existing
router rather than adding on to it. This
option is initially simpler but means
you’ll be using two (or more) IP
addresses, making it more ﬁddly to set
up things that require port forwarding,
such as multiplayer games.
You can create a separate guest
network with its own password, and
like Google Home (see Issue 501) Lyra
lets you create user proﬁles for members
of your family, letting you control what
they can access and when. You also get
Trend Micro’s AirProtection, which
helps to stop malicious websites
communicating with your PCs.
In our tests, we got high speeds of 200
to 350Mbps on the ground and ﬁrst ﬂoor
of our test home, falling to a still very
fast 150Mbps in the attic. This puts the
Lyra on a par with BT Whole Home
Wi-Fi. It wasn’t quite as good at the
bottom of the garden, falling just below
50Mbps, but that still beat the likes of
TP-Link’s Deco M5.
So Lyra is a ﬁne system all round,
but at more than twice the price of BT
Whole Home Wi-Fi, it’s clearly too
expensive. Asus insists its three-unit
pack will cover a home of up to 6,000
square feet, while BT recommends four
dishes for any property more than 4,500
sq ft – but that still works out at £140
less, and most UK homes are under
2,000 sq ft.

23
There’s only room for one more 2.5in and
one 3.5in drive beyond the installed 2TB
hard drive and 256GB M.2 SSD, but the
latter is astonishingly quick, showing
read speeds of over 2400MB/s and nearly
1400MB/s write speeds in our tests – over
three times faster than basic SATA SSDs,
let alone hard drives.
There are also plenty of USB 3.1 ports
for external storage, although if you
want anything like the same speed you’ll
need to use the remaining M.2 slot. Two
memory slots are free to double the
supplied 16GB, and the available PCI slots
would support an SLI dual graphics card
setup as well as a couple of extras such as
a Wi-Fi card or a TV tuner.
The noise issue is not to be ignored, but
this PC is so powerful it would be
churlish not to recommend it. Let’s hope
we have more deals like this to talk about
in the coming months.
Have we mentioned that overclocked
AMD Ryzen processors are quite fast?
Stop us if you’re sick of hearing it,
but seriously, these chips have changed
our expectations of the performance
per pound you can expect from a
desktop PC. The AMD Galaxy is a case in
point. Its Ryzen 7 1700 processor isn’t
even at the top of the range, but with
eight cores and running at an ambitious
3.8GHz (with the help of a sealed
water-cooling unit), it gives this £1,300
desktop PC the kind of muscle that six
months ago you’d have struggled to ﬁnd
for less than £2,000.
We run our own set of benchmark
tests on every PC, so we can see just
how much diﬀerence each advance in
technology makes. In photo editing, the
AMD Galaxy was as fast as last year’s
seventh-generation Intel Core i7 PCs. In
video editing, where the eight cores could
demonstrate their full beneﬁt, it left last
year’s PCs in the dust. We said at the time
that Intel’s eighth-generation Coﬀee Lake
series would ﬁnally give the Ryzens a run
for their money. Well, compared with a
similar system based on the
new top-end six-core Intel
i7-8700, the AMD Galaxy was
over 10 per cent faster overall
and 15 per cent faster in
multitasking. And the Intel
PC was more expensive. To be
fair, you could overclock the
i7-8700K to make up the
diﬀerence, but AMD can trump
that with its even faster Ryzen 7
1800 – and still at a lower
component price.
The AMD Galaxy also features
Gigabyte’s version of the Nvidia GeForce
GTX 1070 graphics card, which comes
with 8GB of its own memory and a
performance level that comes close to the
market-leading GTX 1080. At Full HD
resolution, any game will run very
smoothly on the highest graphics
settings, and less demanding 3D games
are ﬁne up to 4K.
There’s no current graphics card that
will handle the most demanding games
at 4K without some compromise. And
we got a very playable 50-frames-per
-second (fps) frame rates by turning oﬀ
anti-aliasing, which isn’t needed in a
picture that sharp. You won’t see any
jagged edges unless you’re a ﬁghter pilot
who’s drunk way too much coﬀee.
Our only reservation is that the fans
both on the graphics card and on the
water cooler got annoyingly loud during
some processor-intensive tasks, including
games. There were no overheating
problems, though, and if you keep the PC
tucked well under your desk, and you
like the sound turned up loud or use
headphones, it may not bother you.

The latest thing in smartphones is 18:9
screens, which are taller, so you can see
slightly more without having to scroll.
Another way of looking at it (literally)
is they’re wider, when held sideways,
which is actually a bit annoying because
ﬁlms are still 16:9.
At least Huawei hasn’t chopped a funny
notch out of the screen like the 18:9
iPhone X. You get a proper rectangle,
with a narrow strip at the top containing
the camera and phone speaker. You also
have a narrow strip at the bottom with
‘Honor’ on, reminding you that while
iPhone X users paid a grand for their
phone, you got this one for £270.
Fitbit’s Surge smart watch was one of the
more popular models – even Barack
Obama was spotted wearing one – but
not everyone loved it. Its successor also
has an opinion-dividing design, making
no attempt to resemble a traditional watch.
Described as unisex, it looks like it might
suit a robot. But we found it comfortable
to wear, and its display is clear and
bright, protected by Gorilla Glass.
As you’d expect from the Fitbit brand,
ﬁtness tracking is the Ionic’s big selling
point, although it also brings your online
notiﬁcations to your wrist, can run apps
made for Fitbit’s new OS, and store music.
At this price the Honor 7X is an
exceptionally attractive model. It’s big,
but thanks to the narrow format it’s
still comfortable to hold, and the slim,
rounded metal case feels classy. The
screen only covered 85 per cent of the
sRGB colour range in our tests, but with
sharp resolution, high contrast and
reasonable brightness it looks ﬁne.
The eight-core Kirin processor is fast
enough to make the Honor version of
Android 7 (sadly not 8) work smoothly,
although it’s way behind pricier phones
in 3D games performance. The dual
cameras, with background-blur portrait
eﬀect, work very well in good light. On
the back is a ﬁngerprint sensor, which
unlocks the phone very quickly but
doesn’t support contactless payments.
Our main reservation is that the battery
only lasted us nine hours 47 minutes of
video playback. It’ll get you through a
whole day sometimes, but not always.
GPS is built in, but not 3G/4G internet,
and you’ll need an Apple or Android
device to view your data. The Ionic is
fully waterproof, and Fitbit’s claims of
accurate swim tracking were borne out
in our tests, although neither GPS nor
the heart-rate monitor work in the water.
Whether running, swimming or cycling,
it can detect when you start and stop.
You can also shop with it using
contactless Fitbit Pay.
With battery life of about three days in
regular use, the Ionic is a practical smart
watch, and at this price it’s decent value.
iPhone users might prefer an Apple
Watch Series 1, at around £279, but the
Series 3, with GPS, is much pricier.
For a less chunky ﬁtness tracker with
heart monitor and basic notiﬁcations,
consider Fitbit’s Charge 2 (£100, see our

This budget multi-function inkjet printer
comes from the same new Canon range
as the TS8050 (see our review, Issue 504),
which costs £100 more. Sadly it doesn’t
share the sleek two-tone design, but the
TS3150’s more conventional black plastic
case is nonetheless neat and attractive. A
ﬂap at the top rear folds up from the lid of
the scanner to guide paper into the printer.
Without a paper tray as such, you can
only load 60 sheets at one time, reﬂecting
this model’s suitability for occasional
rather than high-volume printing.
Rather than a big colour touchscreen
now found on pricier models, it has a tiny
monochrome LCD that doesn’t really help
with anything. There are, however,
buttons for basic photocopying.
Canon’s PC software makes the various
functions easy to access, though –
including Wi-Fi setup, which in most
cases will happen automatically.
If anything does go awry,
you can plug in a USB
cable temporarily to
do things the old-
fashioned way. Canon
phone apps are also
available, and you can
print directly from
other iOS and Android
apps via AirPrint and
Mopria. Unusually, the
TS3150 takes a black cartridge plus a
single cartridge for its three colour inks.
Ideally, costs should work out at about
5.4p per colour page using Canon’s XL
cartridges, which is slightly cheaper than
average, but there could be some wastage
if you use one colour more than another.
Our tests found scanning acceptably
quick, while printing was noticeably slow
– a maximum rate of 7.4 pages per minute
(ppm) for plain black text and just
1.6ppm for colour graphics. A postcard-
sized colour photo on glossy paper took
two minutes 30 seconds, and we couldn’t
make the TS3150 print on full-size A4
photo paper at all. Its advertised
borderless output only works at smaller
sizes. Canon’s test model had unfortunately
got wet on its way to us, causing vertical
lines in scans and copies, but ignoring
these one-oﬀproblems we were very
happy with the quality of both printing
and scanning.
You’d expect some compromises at this
price. The TS3150’s very slow printing
would be a frustration if you suddenly
needed a 100-page document in a hurry,
and it can’t print both sides (duplex). The
photo-printing restrictions will rule it out
for some. Within its limitations, however,
this is quite a decent printer-scanner for
very little money.
PRINTER ❘£35 from Amazon www.snipca.com/26615
Print more for less
CanonPixma TS3150
It’s amazing that you can get a
multi-function printer for just 35
quid. Of course, there’s a catch
– ink. Using Canon’s XL
cartridges, it costs about 5.4p
to print a colour page using the
TS3150, which compares well
with 7p (and above) on some
budget models. The ISO-standard
pages used for these estimates are
sparse. For colour photos, you might
use ﬁve times more ink, which adds up
much faster. By contrast, the TS3150’s
black ink is relatively pricey, at around
4.3p. Even for text, that’s a tenner extra
for every pack of A4 (500 sheets). So
overall value depends on what you print.
Other factors might make the TS3150
unsuitable. It’s pretty slow. Canon’s old
but decent MG5750 is about twice as
fast and, if you shop around, less than

twice the price. For big photos on
glossy paper, on the other hand, the
HP Envy 5540 (£49 from Tesco Direct

could be a better buy.
None of these printers has an

you can connect it wirelessly to any Mac

It’s not as cheap as some, but the
UltraBoard is easily portable while still

It’s a good thing we have internet
shopping now, because – given its name

and while this portable Bluetooth
keyboard has a conventional design it’s
certainly very useful. Connected to a
PC or Mac via USB, it works as you’d
expect, but it can also be paired
wirelessly with up to ﬁve Apple or
Android phones or tablets.
The keys, though low-proﬁle, have
some of the three-dimensional shape and
tight spacing of a traditional mechanical
keyboard. Underneath are scissor
switches like those used in most laptops.
They feel reasonably crisp when pressed,
giving an audible click without being too
irritating, and we had no trouble typing
at speed. The single-deck Enter key is
easy to miss at ﬁrst, as is the tiddly
Backspace, but there’s a full set of
function keys that provide the usual
options across the various operating
systems, plus a set of buttons at the top

NumLock. The latter turns the keys below
7, 8 and 9 into a virtual number pad,
because a separate one wouldn’t ﬁt in the
compact format. Fold-out legs let you
angle the keyboard, although they are
somewhat ﬂimsy.

We’ve tested several Wi-Fi home-security
cameras, which connect wirelessly and
are controlled from an app, making them
simple and ﬂexible to use. But they
mostly have the same two disadvantages.
First, they rely on visual motion-sensing
to start recording then send you a
notiﬁcation, which is annoyingly prone
to triggering when nobody’s actually
there. Secondly, to store and replay what
they see for more than 24 hours (or in
some cases to store any footage at all),
you have to pay several pounds a month
for an online service.
This more traditional CCTV kit from
Swann avoids those issues, but has an
app too. The four cameras – which are
suitable for indoor or outdoor use – must
be wired to the base unit (18 metres of
cable is provided for each) and only
record video, not sound. No computer is
required: the digital recorder connects to

Swann’s digital recorder can store more
video than you’re ever likely to need on
its 1TB hard drive, with no ongoing
costs. But if a savvy intruder rips out
the box, you’ve lost all trace of their
visit. With online cameras, there’s a
monthly fee to store more than a little
bit of footage – typically what was
captured in the last 24 hours – but at
least the evidence is always safe online.
Netgear’s Arlo cameras (from £169,
or £270 for three, see Issue 454,
pictured) work wirelessly from
batteries indoors and out, and come
with a week’s free online storage.
Backing up to a USB drive is possible

ﬁeld of view isn’t very wide, which
minimises the ‘ﬁshbowl’ eﬀect but
requires careful positioning. Recording is
triggered by passive infra-red (PIR)
sensors on the cameras – the ‘heat
sensing’ part – which is more reliable
than the image-processing methods used
by most cams. We found it worked very
well, and wasn’t falsely triggered by
events like the movement of shadows.
You can limit activation to scheduled

noise escaping. The USB 3.0 interface will
suit the vast majority of PCs and Macs.
It’ll also work with USB 2.0 ports, but
that would cut speeds by more than half.
No mains power is needed.
The Ultra Slim drive is only available
formatted as NTFS, for Windows, but
Mac users can install Seagate’s Paragon
NTFS driver for macOS 10.10 or above,
making the drive usable across both
platforms, or reformat it themselves.
There’s nothing especially backup-related
about the drive itself, but it comes with
Seagate’s Dashboard software to back up
a Windows PC, while Mac users are
sensibly advised to use Apple’s built-in
Time Machine feature for that.
Seagate’s Backup Plus desktop drives
have been a popular choice for years, but
this portable model is a very diﬀerent
proposition. Less than a centimetre thick,
it’s as portable as a mobile phone. The
case comes in a distinctive sandblasted
ﬁnish with a pattern of large circular
dimples, available in gold or platinum
colours. It looks very much like
something a particularly stylish Bond
villain might slip in a suit pocket to keep
the plans for world domination handy.
You can also get it in a plain brushed
silver, blue, red or black.
Inside is a traditional mechanical hard
drive, which explains why you can get a
terabyte of storage for less money than an
external SSD with a quarter of the
capacity. A 2TB version is also available
for around £75, which is even better
value. Of course, the downside is that it’s
nowhere near as fast, and certainly won’t
trouble the 640 megabytes-per-second
ceiling of its USB 3.0 interface.
In our tests, it peaked at 135MB/s
reading and 125MB/s writing, which is a
little faster than most portable hard
drives. A large batch of small ﬁles – the
most challenging prospect for disk-based
hardware because it has to ﬁnd lots of
diﬀerent places on the surface of the
spinning platters – didn’t slow it down
as much as some rivals.
Hard drives are inherently more
breakable than solid-state drives, and this
isn’t sold as a rugged device, but the
plastic case seems sturdy enough and
manages to stop most of the mechanical

Casio FX-7000G
WHAT WAS IT?
Introduced in 1985, the FX-
7000G was the ﬁrst graphing
calculator. For about $90
($200 today, or £150), it
incorporated maths operations
such as square roots and
logarithms, supported its own
programming language, and
could graph functions on its 64x96-
pixel monochrome LCD screen. It was
the most powerful computing device
anyone was likely to have in their pocket.
HOW HAVE THINGS CHANGED?
The FX-7000G’s capabilities were
enabled by its processor, a variant of the
Zilog Z80. This 8bit design permitted
16bit addressing and could access up
to 64K of memory, although the FX-
7000G oﬀered less than half a kilobyte.
Today, a basic Android smartphone
has millons of times more processing
power and at least a gigabyte of
memory (RAM), and can not only run
graphing calculator apps, but much
more powerful maths software.
Ironically, calculators made by Casio
and Texas Instruments are still popular
because phones aren’t allowed in
school and university exams.

To download it, go to www.
snipca.com/26676 and click
the blue Multi-Launcher link
(in the paragraph beginning ‘New
release’). It’s a portable tool, so doesn’t
require installation. Launch it and the
program will run in the background,
keeping track of everything you do. The
window will be empty at ﬁrst, but will
start to list programs as they come into
use 1 . You can hide the window until
it’s required by selecting it and pressing
Esc. You can also hide or show it at any
time by clicking on the icon in the
system tray 2.
STEP
2
The Programs list shows when each piece of
software last ran. This string of numbers 1
is made up of the date (year, month, day)
and time (in 24-hour format, including seconds).
The currently selected program appears at the top of
the list 2. You can see the name 3, and install
location 4 of all running programs. To use Multi
Launcher as a task switcher, double-click any name
in the list to bring that program’s window to the
forefront.
W
eb browsers record and store
every site you visit, as well as
every ﬁle you download. In Windows,
File Explorer’s Quick Access feature
remembers frequently accessed
folders and the 20 most recently
opened items. While these provide
handy snapshots of some activity
that’s taken place on your computer,
Multi-Launcher provides a much
more comprehensive breakdown,
listing all the ﬁles, folders, programs
and links that you (or anyone else)
has accessed on your PC.

You can, however, ﬁnd any
item quickly by using the search
box 1 . Press Shift+Pause to open
the program window, then start typing
any part of the name. The list will display
potential matches, reﬁning the results as
you type 2. If you’re looking for a
particular kind of ﬁle, such as an MP3
audio ﬁle, type MP3 into the box. Note,
unlike a lot of similar programs, Multi
Launcher doesn’t support wildcards, so
typing *.MP3, for example, won’t return
anything.
STEP
5
The Folders tab 1 lists any folders that
you’ve opened or accessed in Windows.
This can be really handy if you want to
quickly reopen a folder in File Explorer – just
double-click a location in the list. There are a couple
of things to be aware of though. Some entries in the
list link directly to programs or documents rather
than locations, and while any searches you’ve
performed in File Explorer appear in the list,
double-clicking one will show an error message
rather than repeat the same search.
STEP
6
The Web Pages tab 1 shows all the sites
you’ve visited, and all the links you’ve
clicked 2. Double-clicking a URL will
switch to that tab (if it’s still open) or re-open that
page in a new tab. You can use the search box to ﬁnd
and launch any previously visited site, and this will
also let you ﬁlter the list by browser, if you use more
than one. Type chrome into the box, for example, to
only show web pages visited using your Chrome
browser.
STEP
3
The tabs at the top let you switch
between the Programs,
Documents, Folders, and Web
Pages sections 1 . The Documents section
doesn’t only contain Word or text ﬁles – it
lists most ﬁle types, including audio and
video formats. As a result, the list can
quickly get long, making ﬁnding a
particular item challenging. You can sort
the list by time, name, and ﬁle path 2,
but not by ﬁle extension (.pdf, for example).

Items in the list can be sorted by date (last used) 1 or
by usage 2 (most frequently accessed). That will help
you quickly ﬁnd anything you’ve been working on
recently. Right-click any item – a program, document, folder
or web page – and the context menu that appears will oﬀer
you a choice of actions. You can delete the item (only from the
list, not from your computer) 3, ﬁlter it out of the list 4, or
edit the ﬁlter 5.
STEP
9
To conﬁgure Multi-Launcher, right-click its
icon in the system tray. This displays a list of
options. If you ﬁnd the text in the program
too small, click Set Font Size 1 and increase it.
Untick ‘Use Tabbed View’ 2 to switch to the Stacked
(or vertical) view that shows the top results for each
section on one screen 3. If you’re using the latest
version of Firefox (Quantum) and sites you visit
aren’t being recorded, untick ‘Use Firefox Legacy’ 4.
STEP
10
If you want to save the lists for future access, go to DATA
Options 1 . In the pop-up menu you can back up all lists 2 to a
location of your choice (create a new folder if required) and also
restore all lists 3. This menu lets you clear the programs, documents,
folders or URL lists 4 and remove any invalid recent items 5. The Set
Refresh Time option 6 lets you choose how often Multi-Launcher records
new items. This can be half a second, one second or two seconds. ●
STEP
7
You should be aware that Multi-Launcher records all
pages visited in your browser, including ones accessed
in Private Browsing/Incognito mode 1 . If you want to
see what sites friends or family members have been accessing
‘oﬀthe record’ on your PC, leave Multi-Launcher running in the
background and then switch to it once they’ve ﬁnished. If you
want to remove sites you’ve visited in this mode you can do so
via the right-click context menu.

Install PhraseExpress (www.
phraseexpress.com) and open it.
The folders on the left 1 provide
features and tips on how to use the
program. We’ll start by creating our ﬁrst
‘boilerplate’ response – a default message
you can send when you don’t have time
to write a proper response but want the
sender to know you’ve received and read
their message. Click the New Phrase
button.
STEP
2
Give your new phrase a description 1 , then enter your response
text in the ‘Formatted phrase content’ box below 2. You can
format the text 3, paste in content 4, add pictures 5, links 6 and
tables 7 . You can insert the current date and time in the format of your
choice 8. PhraseExpress saves your changes as you make them, so you
don’t need to click a save button.
A
ccording to market research
ﬁrm The Radicati Group,
around 3.1 billion people currently
have access to email, with 269
billion messages being sent every
day. Even if you only get a few
emails every week, the time spent
replying to them, or sending new
ones, can soon add up. Thankfully,
PhraseExpress can help save you
time. The free program lets you
create custom responses you can
paste into emails and messaging
services like WhatsApp.
Create automatic
email replies
STEP
3
Next, create the keyboard shortcut (hotkey)
you want to use to quickly paste this response
into your messages. To do this, type a
keyboard character into the box (for example, Q in
our screenshot 1 ) or click the down arrow and select
one from the dropdown menu. Some keys may
already be reserved by the operating system or
another program, in which case you’ll see the yellow
warning symbol 2. Click any combination of the
Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Win buttons 3 to create your
keyboard shortcut (the yellow warning will disappear).

If you set up a lot of phrases, using
shortcuts and/or autotext, you might ﬁnd
you start to forget those you don’t use
regularly. As a backup, you can export a particular
saved response as a text ﬁle or email 1 , or print the
full list of phrases 2 so you can refer to it as and
when you need to. ●
STEP
4
There’s another easier method of pasting
your phrase into an email response. Simply
type a descriptive word (or short phrase)
into the Autotext box 1 . You can make it case
sensitive if you want 2. Once set up, just type this
word into your message followed by the so-called
‘default delimiter’, which in this case is any
punctuation mark, or the Enter, Tab, or Space keys.
To avoid accidentally triggering the autotext, don’t
use an everyday word; use something like “xreply”
or “reply1” instead.
STEP
5
The dropdown menu 1 on the right lets you determine when the
autotext is triggered. The default option is ‘Execute after default
delimiter’, but you can have it run the moment you ﬁnish typing
your word. To avoid accidentally creating autotext you can set it so you
have to manually conﬁrm the action 2 (by hitting the tab key when
prompted). SmartComplete 3 kicks in when you type the ﬁrst three letters
of your message description. You can also unlock additional options by
switching to Expert Mode 4 but it’s not necessary.
STEP
6
PhraseExpress works in any text window,
so you aren’t limited to pasting your
response in emails. You can also paste it
into messaging programs, Word, Notepad and
more by using the keyboard shortcut or autotext
keyword you created. The built-in Clipboard
Cache remembers everything you’ve saved to the
clipboard. You can paste any into any text window
by tapping the default key combination (Ctrl+Alt+V)
and selecting the item you want from the list 1 or
pressing its saved message 2.

Go to www.snipca.com/26710 to see a list of
problems CIR can help you repair. To download
the program, scroll down the web page to the
Download Complete Internet Repair section, where you

You can launch the program via its desktop shortcut
whenever you notice your internet isn’t working properly.
STEP
2
When you open the program, click the Help tab 1 , then ‘Check for
updates’. If you’re not using the latest version, you’ll be prompted
to update it. CIR recommends you create a system restore point 2.
To do this, click the Maintenance tab 3, then ‘Create a Windows Restore
Point’ 4. In the System Properties window that opens, click Create 5, name
your restore point, then click Create. Once that’s done, click Close.

CIR also lets you measure your broadband speed and

Go button on the screen that opens. To ﬁnd your router’s default
password, click Get Router Passwords 2. On the page that
opens, select your router’s name from the dropdown menu,
then click Find Password. ●
STEP

Your PC may freeze and cursor may ﬂicker
momentarily as the ﬁxes are applied. You’ll
see a blue progress bar under the ﬁx as it’s
being applied. You can stop any ﬁx by clicking the
Stop button (that replaces the Go button at the
bottom right). When all the ﬁxes have been applied,
you’ll see the ‘All selected tasks Complete’ message
at the top. Next, click the File tab 1 , then click
Reboot Windows 2 to restart your PC and check
whether the problems have been ﬁxed.
STEP
5
If you still have problems, CIR has other tools that you can use to
ﬁnd and ﬁx them. For example, if you think your PC’s wireless
adapter is the cause, click the Troubleshoot tab 1 then click
Network Diagnostics Network Adapter. In the Network Adapter window
that opens, click Next 2. After a short scan, you’ll be prompted to select the
network adapter that isn’t working - Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ‘All
network adapters’ etc. Any faulty items will display a red cross.
STEP
6
Select the faulty item, then click Next to start applying
the ﬁx. You’ll see a message when that’s ﬁnished.
If you think the problem is caused by your internet
connection, PCs connected to a home group or Windows
Update, click the Troubleshoot tab 1 , then select the relevant
option 2. You’ll see a window similar to that in Step 5. Click
Next and follow the prompts to ﬁx the problem.

your picture, select it, and click Open. PicResize
recognises all of the popular image formats, including JPEG,
GIF, PNG, BMP and SVG. The developers plan to add support for
additional image formats in the future, but for now if you want
to resize something like a PSD (Photoshop) ﬁle, you’ll need to
convert it into a diﬀerent format. There are many programs you
can use for this, like CloudConvert (https://cloudconvert.com).
STEP

You’ll now be asked what size you want the printed
image to be. Use the Units dropdown box 1 to choose
between centimetres (the default), millimetres, inches,
or pixels. Next, enter the width you want 2, and the height 3.

t’s easy enough to resize photos for
sending or sharing – you just need
an image editor or an online tool like
PicResize (www.picresize.com). But
it can be harder to resize an image
for printing at a speciﬁc physical
size. If you’ve ever tried to print a
photo for a 6x4in frame, and ended
up ﬁlling an A4 sheet, you’ll know
what we mean. Resize.site (https://

SCREENS
Use Windows Repair to
restore aspect ratio
The aspect ratio on my eMachines
laptop changed from 16:9 to 4:3
for no apparent reason, resulting in all
my icons and images becoming short
and fat. I could ﬁnd no way of reversing
the change until I read Norman A
Clark’s tip in Issue 517 recommending
Tweaking.com’s Windows Repair
(www.snipca.com/26322). I downloaded
and ran it, and after a restart all was
well and I got my 16:9 screen back. Well
done Computeractive, Windows Repair
and Norman.

COMMANDLINE ACTIONS
Use NirSoft’s command-line
options
It didn’t surprise me to see NirSoft’s
DevManView (www.snipca.
com/24964) in the list of readers’ most
popular programs of 2017 (Issue 518, page
59). Computeractive introduced me to
NirSoft’s programs a few years back, and
I’ve been using them ever since. They
fulﬁll the key purpose of software for me,
which is to improve upon Windows’
built-in functions.
One of my favourite things about them
is they give you lots of command-line
options. This is a part of Windows I love
tinkering with. In DevManView, for
example, you can type /stext to save a list
of all your system devices as a text ﬁle.
The same command saves searches in
SearchMyFiles (www.snipca.com/26643),
probably the NirSoft tool I use most.
There are hundreds of others, all listed
and explained jargon-free on the page for
each program (scroll down to see them).
Any reader who loves the command-line
as much as I do will enjoy browsing the
options.

SECURITY
Use Task Manager to escape
tech-support scam
If when using the internet you get a
‘click to call’ tech-support scam
that threatens to ‘disable, lock or suspend
your device if you close this message’,
don’t be alarmed. Simply right-click
your taskbar, then click Task Manager.
On the Processes tab you’ll see an Apps
column, where you’ll see the name of the
browser you’re using. Right-click this
and left-click ‘End task’ (see screenshot
above). When you reopen your browser
the scam message will be gone.

5 in the screenshot). Click OK.
Once that’s done, LibreOﬃce will
start remembering new words you type.
When you type a word again, you’ll see
it appear in a little box, prompting you
to complete it. You can do this by
pressing Enter, saving you the hassle of
typing more letters. I use lots of long

PhoneandTabletTips Brilliant things to do on your device
ANDROID & iOS
Add eﬀects and messages
to your photos
p
In Issue 517, we explained
how to use the free app
Pixlr to create a photo
collage. The app also lets you edit your
photos, add eﬀects and frames, and even
scribble a message across your photo.
Open the app (Android www.snipca.
com/26683; iOS www.snipca.
com/26684), then tap ‘photos’ to see a list
of locations you can import photos from.
As well as your photo gallery, you can
import photos from your Downloads
folder, Google Photos, Google Drive or
Dropbox. Select the location, then tap to
choose the photo you want to edit.
You’ll now see your photo with ﬁve
icons along the bottom (see screenshot
below left). The ﬁrst icon has options to
crop, rotate, blur and sharpen your photo.
The second lets you brighten, darken or
scribble something across your photo.
The middle icon oﬀers several photo-
ﬁlter eﬀects that you can apply. The
fourth icon lets you choose from a
selection of frames. And the ﬁfth icon lets
you write a message across your photo.
Tap ‘done’ at the top left to see options to
save the edited photo to your device, or
share it on social media.
ANDROID
Type faster using Gboard
The Gboard keyboard app (www.
snipca.com/26685) has several
settings that can help speed up
your typing, but many of these are easy to
overlook. For example, Gboard doesn’t
include a numbers panel by default, but
it’s easy to add one. To do this, tap the
right-pointing arrow at the top left of the
keyboard, tap the three dots on the right,
Settings, then Preferences. Here, tap the
‘Number row’ slider to add a number row
to the top of your keyboard.
While you’re at it, tap ‘Text correction’
after tapping Settings to see a list of
settings that can make typing easier
(most of these sliders aren’t switched on
by default). We recommend enabling
‘Show suggestion strip’, ‘Next-word
suggestions’, ‘Auto-correction’, ‘Auto-
capitalisation’ and ‘Double-space full
stop’ (see screenshot above). Each option
has a brief description of what it does.
ANDROID

we showed you how to use
Google’s new free Files Go app to recover
storage space on your device. One feature
we didn’t have space to cover is the option
to send ﬁles instantly from one Android
device to another, even without an
internet connection. For this to work,
both devices will need to have the app
(www.snipca.com/26688) installed.
The sender needs to open the app, tap
the Files tab at the bottom right, scroll to
the bottom, then tap Send. The receiver
then needs to open their app, tap the Files
tab, then tap Receive. After doing so, the
receiver taps the slider to let their device
transfer ﬁles wirelessly. They then need to
type their name (for identiﬁcation
purposes), then tap Next.
The sender will now see the receiver’s
name listed in their app. They need to
tap this to connect the two devices. The
receiver then taps Connect to conﬁrm
this. The sender will now see various ﬁle
categories (Images, Videos, Audio, etc) at
the top. They need to select the relevant
category, tap to select the ﬁles they want
to send, then tap Send to transfer the ﬁle
between devices.

What’s All the Fuss About...
Tacotron 2
Google reckons it has cracked text-to-speech technology, but can a computer-
generated voice really be indistinguishable from a human one?
‘decorum’. But, aside from its inability to
order wine in a swanky restaurant,
Tacotron 2 is actually pretty convincing.
You can even see (or rather hear) for
yourself by playing the audio samples
Google has posted online at www.snipca.
com/26678. In each case you can listen to
both a Tacotron 2 sample and a real
human voice reading the same text, and
see if you can tell which is which. In
many cases it’s genuinely too close to call.
So, when will we all be chatting
with our computers, then?
Tacotron 2 is still very much in
development. A research paper was
only submitted just before Christmas
(www.snipca.com/26679), and it’ll be
a while before the technology makes it
to our devices. Currently, it can’t
generate audio in real-time and Google
is still working on a way to reproduce
emotions, such as sadness and happiness.
On top of that, the current voice used is
that of an American female, so to
generate male speech patterns or other
localised accents and languages, the
whole system would need to be trained
again. Whether or not Stephen Hawking
has his eye on a Tacotron 2 upgrade
is unknown.
What is it?
It’s a new text-to-speech system
developed by Google, which aims to
make computers and other devices speak
with a much more natural, human-like
voice.
Why is it important?
Currently, text-to-speech (TTS) is
commonly used for getting our devices to
read text ﬁles – documents, web pages,
ebooks and so on – aloud to us. Microsoft
Narrator, which is built into Windows,
is a good example. So, one obvious
beneﬁt would be to make TTS
applications like these sound more
natural and less robotic.
But current technology trends point to
a future where we will increasingly ﬁnd
ourselves using our voices to interact
with technology – not just voice-
controlled virtual assistants like Cortana,
Siri and Google Now, but also smart
speakers, such as Google Home and
Amazon Echo (pictured below), smart
TVs and – eventually – cars, heating
systems and any number of devices in
between. These devices rely heavily on
speech-recognition technology to
understand our spoken commands. But
they also have to use an eﬀective TTS
engine to generate their vocal responses.
The less artiﬁcial and stilted our devices
sound when they talk, the more
comfortable we feel when we use them,
which is why creating natural TTS is an
ongoing goal for many tech companies.
How does it work?
In its Research blog (www.snipca.
com/26677), Google explains that
Tacotron 2 is, in fact, powered by the best
bits of two of the company’s previous TTS
technologies, namely Tacotron and
WaveNet. Firstly, Tacotron technology is
used to convert a sequence of text into a
spectrogram (a visual representation of a
spectrum), which can capture subtle
diﬀerences – such as pronunciation,
volume, speed, intonation and so on. This
data is then interpreted into actual audio
output, using a WaveNet-like technique,
which generates raw, natural-sounding
speech waveforms from scratch, rather
than artiﬁcially sticking snippets of
pre-recorded spoken text together.
But it still sounds fake, right?
Google admits that the system still has
diﬃculties pronouncing complex words
including, apparently, ‘merlot’ and
Smart speakers like the Amazon Echo need to
sound natural to be popular

time by taking care of repetitive tasks
automatically. And it can remember to
carry out important duties, so that you
don’t have to.
In this feature, we’ll be looking at some
of the most useful tasks that you can get
your PC to take care of all by itself. We’ll
explain how to set each one up using
either Windows’ built-in tools and
settings or free software.
But you don’t necessarily need a cyborg
Jeeves to do the jobs you hate – instead
you can delegate many routine tasks to
your PC.
The principles of task scheduling are
simple – you’re eﬀectively telling your
computer to carry out a particular action
when speciﬁc criteria – a time, date or
event – are met. One simple example
might be an alarm clock, where the
action is a sound scheduled to occur at a
speciﬁc time every day. But your PC’s
scheduling abilities go way beyond that.
Behind the scenes, your computer is
actually running dozens of tasks on
schedules already – checking for updates,
defragging your drives and more. You can
• Set security, maintenance and backup
tasks to happen automatically
• Schedule print jobs, reminders,
alarms, downloads and much more
• Uncover settings and software
to automate other PC, tablet and
smartphone functions
• Find out how to use Windows’ hidden
Task Scheduler tool

USE WINDOWS’ HIDDEN SCHEDULING TOOL
Later in this feature we cover essential
programs and settings that let you
schedule tasks on your PC, but Windows
also has its own dedicated scheduling
tool. Task Scheduler has been part of
Windows in one shape or another since
Windows 95, but often gets overlooked
– partly because it’s not easy to ﬁnd, but
also because it’s not the easiest tool to
use. Nevertheless, once you’ve learned
the basics, you’ll ﬁnd that it’s pretty
powerful.
Task Scheduler is tucked away in
Windows’ Computer Management
console, so the easiest way to ﬁnd it is by
clicking Start, typing schedule and
pressing Enter. Its main screen is split
into three panes, with the Task Scheduler
Library on the left, an Overview in the
middle and a list of Actions on the right.
Click the Task Scheduler Library heading,
and the middle pane will change to show
existing scheduled tasks at the top and
details about each below.
You’ll notice that your PC already has
quite a few items scheduled. These are
tasks that have been automatically
conﬁgured by programs you have
installed on your PC. Your graphics card,
for example, may have set up a task that
automatically checks for updates at
speciﬁed intervals. Click the arrow next
to Task Scheduler Library to reveal
further folders. Click the arrow next to
the Microsoft folder, then click the arrow
next to Windows to show all the tasks
Windows runs on a schedule, without
any input from you.
Each task has a Trigger and an Action,
and settings you can specify. The Trigger
could be a scheduled time or a speciﬁc
occurrence, such as when you log into
your PC. The Action usually involves
starting a program, but you can use
‘arguments’ (a computer-science term)
to further deﬁne the Action that the
program carries out when it runs. That
might all sound somewhat complicated,
so the best way to make it clearer is by
talking you through a few diﬀerent
examples.
1
Schedule your PC to
shut down every night
Launch Task Scheduler as described
above, then click Create Basic Task on the
right. This will launch the Create Basic
Task Wizard. Type a name for your task
– Shut down at night, for example – and a
longer description if it’s helpful, then
click Next. In the Trigger options, select
Daily, then click Next. Now, choose the
time you want your PC to turn oﬀand
make sure there’s a ‘1’ in the ‘Recur
every… days’ box.
Click Next, ensure that ‘Start a
program’ is selected in the Action list and
click Next again. In the ‘Program/script’
box, type shutdown, then in the ‘Add
arguments’ box, type /s /f /t 30 (see
screenshot below). The ‘/s’ element of the
argument tells the program to shut down
your PC, the ‘/f’ tells it to force programs
to close and the ‘/t 30’ sets a time-out
period of 30 seconds, which provides
a brief on-screen warning before your
PC switches oﬀ. If you want to restart
your PC instead of shutting it down, you
could substitute the ‘/s’ for ‘/r’. Click
Next, then Finish.
2
Wake your PC up
every morning
Setting your PC to go to sleep
automatically doesn’t require any
tinkering in Task Scheduler. In Windows
10, for example, the easiest way to do this
is to click Start, Settings, System, ‘Power
& sleep’, then select how long you want
to wait before automatically entering
Sleep mode in the ‘When plugged in,
PC goes to sleep after’ menu. However,
making it wake up again at a speciﬁc
time of day – say, every morning at 8am
– will require a spot of scheduling.
Follow the steps above to launch the
Task Scheduler and work your way
through the Create Basic Task Wizard
as before, selecting Daily in the Trigger
options, then entering the time of day
you want the PC to wake up. This time,
when you see the ‘Program/script’
box, type cmd.exe and, in the ‘Add
arguments’ box, type /c “exit”, then
click Next, followed by Finish.
Before you exit Task Scheduler,
though, click Task Scheduler Library,
then right-click your newly created task
in the middle pane and select Properties.
On the General tab, tick the ‘Run with
highest privileges’ box and select the
‘Run whether user is logged on or not’
option. Click the Conditions tab in the
window that opens, then tick the ‘Wake
the computer to run this task’ box (see
screenshot above), then click OK. Enter
Tick ‘Wake the

17 – 30 January 2018
Though powerful, Windows Task
Scheduler is undeniably clunky and dated.
We’d love to see a modern scheduling tool
incorporated into Windows 10’s Settings
app at some point, though this seems
unlikely. Instead, Microsoft is adding
scheduling options, such as Cortana’s
recurring reminders (see page 56), across
the operating system.
Several free alternatives to Task
Scheduler are available, such as Z-Cron
(www.z-cron.com) and Splinterware
System Scheduler (www.snipca.com/
26586). But, to be honest, these tend to
be just as unwieldy as Microsoft’s built-in
option. If you don’t like Task Scheduler,
then you’re probably better oﬀusing
individual tools and settings that provide
alternative ways to schedule speciﬁc
tasks, rather than several in one go. For
example, Wise Auto Shutdown (free from
www.snipca.com/26529, see screenshot)
provides a much simpler way to set your
PC to switch oﬀ, restart or go to sleep.
ALTERNATIVES TO TASKSCHEDULER
your Windows password, if prompted.
Note that your PC will automatically
go back to sleep if you don’t use it before
the time you set in the ‘Power & sleep’
settings. And, if you’re using a laptop,
your PC won’t wake up unless it’s
plugged into the mains.
3
Fetch the morning papers
If you like to read the news
headlines ﬁrst thing in the morning
when you start your PC, create a
schedule that not only automatically
launches your web browser, but also
opens your favourite news websites as
soon as you log on (or at another time
of your choosing).
Open Task Scheduler and create a
new basic task (as described above).
Under Trigger options, choose ‘When I
log on’, and under Action, choose ‘Start a
program’. If you use the Chrome browser,
type chrome.exe into the ‘Program/script’
box. In the ‘Add arguments’ box, enter
the URL for the website you want to open
– http://bbc.co.uk/news, for example
(see screenshot right).
If you want to open several websites
in individual tabs, enter their URLs
into the ‘Add arguments’ box, separating
each with a space. In the ‘Start in’
box, type the location of the directory
where the program you want to launch is
stored. In the case of Chrome, for
example, that would normally be
C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\
Application. Make sure the address is
typed correctly, and don’t leave an extra
‘\’ at the end. Click Next, followed by
Type a URL in Task Scheduler to make your PC go straight to
certain sites when it starts
Finish, then restart your PC
to test it.
If this procedure doesn’t
work and you’re using a
laptop on battery power,
right-click your task in the
Task Scheduler Library, then
select Properties. Click the
Conditions tab, untick the
‘Start the task only if the
computer is on AC power’
option then click OK.
To avoid slowing your
PC’s startup, you could also
opt to delay the task slightly. Right-click
the task, select Properties, Triggers, then
double-click ‘At log on’. Under ‘Advanced
settings’, tick the ‘Delay task for’ option
then select ‘15 minutes’ in the dropdown
menu. Click OK twice.
SECURITY & BACKUP

Automatically clean up
your PC
Before the Windows 10 Creators Update
in April last year, if you wanted to rid
your PC of junk on a regular basis,
you’d either have to remember to run
Windows Disk Clean-up manually
or set up a convoluted scheduled task
involving advanced command-line
switches. Worse still, many junk-
cleaning tools – including CCleaner
– don’t let you schedule junk clear-outs
unless you pay for the premium version.
Now, though, there’s an easy, free way
to run this type of task on an automatic
schedule from within Windows. Click
Start, Settings, System, Storage, then
click ‘Change how we free up space’
under ‘Storage sense’. Click the slider at
the top to turn Storage Sense on, then
tick the boxes to select the ﬁles you
want to get rid of (see screenshot left).
Tick them all and Windows will erase
temporary ﬁles on an ongoing basis and
delete unused ﬁles that have been in the
recycle bin or the Downloads folder for
over 30 days.
5
Schedule a
system-image backup
Windows 10’s built-in backup tools
aren’t bad, but they lack the option
to perform scheduled system-image
backups – copies of your entire hard
drive that you can restore in the
event of hardware failure or damage.
Thankfully, EaseUS Todo Backup Free
has this covered. You can download
the program free from www.snipca.
com/26589, though take care to deselect
Tick these boxes and Windows 10 will remove

any unwanted options when installing.
To set up an image-backup schedule
in EaseUS Todo Backup Free, click
System Backup, then select your
System Name from the top pane and
click the folder icon under Destination
to browse to a connected external drive
that you want to save the backup to.
Next, click Schedule and select your
options – we’d suggest scheduling a
Monthly backup (see screenshot above).
Choose the time and day you want
the backup to occur, then click Save,
followed by Proceed.
6
Schedule Windows Updates
Windows 10 is notorious for forcing
automatic updates on PC users but,
with a bit of simple scheduling, you
can make sure you’re never again
interrupted by annoying update-related
restarts. Click Start, Settings, ‘Update
& security’, then click ‘Change active
hours’. Here, you can schedule a section
of your working day when you don’t
want to have to contend with a random
We recommend setting a monthly backup schedule in EaseUS Todo Backup
restart (8.00 to 20.00 in our screenshot
below). Just click a ‘Start time’ and an
‘End time’, then click Save. The latest
version of Windows 10 lets you stipulate
a period of up to 18 hours.
Another recent improvement is
an option to schedule a time for any
pending updates to ﬁnish installing.
Click ‘Restart options’ (under ‘Change
active hours’), switch it on and select a
time and day in the dropdown menus
(17.37 and ‘today’ in our screenshot
below).
7
Schedule a regular
security scan
Most paid-for security programs let you
set security scans on a schedule. For
example, in Kaspersky Internet Security
(winner of our past nine antivirus tests
– see our Reader Oﬀer page 70), click
Scan, ‘Scan schedule’ and choose the
type of scan you want (Full Scan,
Quick Scan or Vulnerability Scan).
Next, select the frequency from the ‘Run
scan’ dropdown menu (see screenshot
below), set a time, then click Save.
Many free security tools limit the
control you have over scheduling
scans. Windows 10’s built-in Defender,
for example, runs on an automated
schedule but doesn’t let you stipulate
when or how the scans are carried
out. If you use AVG AntiVirus Free,
though, you get a very decent amount
of scheduling options without having to
pay for the premium version.
Launch the AVG dashboard and click
the cog icon next to Scan Computer,
then click Schedule Scan in the bottom
right of the next screen. Give the scan
a name and select which drives you
want to scan under Scan Areas. You can
use the tabs on the left to choose other
options for your scan, such as Sensitivity
(how thorough you want your scan to
be) and Exceptions (ﬁles and folders you
want your scan to ignore). Next, click
the Scheduling tab at the bottom, tick
the ‘Schedule this scan’ box and set
your Schedule Type (Once, Daily,
Weekly or Monthly) then choose the
time, days, and any other options you
require. Click OK.

If you really want to go to town with your
PC scheduling, you could use a service
called IFTTT (https://ifttt.com). Its name
stands for ‘If This Then That’ and it’s a
surprisingly simple way to automate all
kinds of tasks, from saving attachments
to Dropbox whenever you receive one via
email, to setting up a weekly email digest
of all the songs you’ve liked on Spotify.
IFTTT basically works by connecting the
various services you use. And you can
also connect web-connected ‘smart’
devices, such as a ﬁtness tracker, Philips
HuelightingoraHivehome-heatingsystem.
For a list of all the services and products
IFTTT supports, go to www.snipca.com/
26600. Click each one for a few examples
of what’s possible. To use IFTTT, sign
up for a free account, then click My
Applets, followed by New Applet. Click
the large blue ‘+this’ link and choose the
ﬁrst service you want to connect - scroll
down for YouTube, for example. Click the
Connect button, then sign in with your
YouTube account. You’ll see a selection of
triggers. Choose the one you want – for
example, you could choose to trigger an
action every time a YouTube user you
subscribe to posts a new video (third from
the left in the screenshot above).
Once you’ve created the trigger, click
the blue ‘+that’ link to set up the action.
For example, you could connect your
Gmail account here and choose ‘Send
yourself an email’ as the action, so that
you’ll automatically receive an email
message whenever the YouTube user
posts a new video.

Schedule a print job for later
Most printers have a hidden setting
that makes it extremely easy to schedule
print jobs to occur at a speciﬁc time of
day. To access this, open Windows 10’s
Settings app, click Devices, then ‘Printers
& scanners’. Click your printer in the
list, Manage, then ‘Printer properties’.
Click the Advanced tab, then check the
‘Available from’ option and enter the
period of the day you would like your
print jobs to take place in the From and
To boxes – say 19.00 to 20.00 (as in our
screenshot below), then click OK. Next
time you print a document outside of
these hours, you’ll see a message telling
you that the print job will occur when
the printer is available.
9
Send an email at a
particular time and date
It can be extremely useful to draft an
email in advance, then set it to be sent at
a speciﬁed time in the future. If you have
Microsoft Oﬃce, you can use Outlook’s
Delay Delivery tool (under the Options
tab in the Message window), but very few
free email programs include this feature.
You can, however, add a similar ability
to Gmail if you use Chrome. Install the
free Right Inbox extension from www.
snipca.com/26592, then log into Gmail.
You’ll be asked to sign in with your
Google account again to ﬁnish setting up
the extension. Now, whenever you write
an email, you’ll see a Send Later option
at the bottom. Click this, then select
from one of the preset times or click ‘At a
speciﬁc time’ to schedule a precise date
and time (see screenshot below left).
It will then be sent at that time even if
you’re not using Chrome or your PC is
switched oﬀ.
10
Schedule ﬁle downloads
at any time of day or night
If you’d rather not have large, disruptive
downloads clogging up your bandwidth
during the day and slowing down your
broadband speeds, you could schedule
them to happen in the wee hours of
the morning by using Free Download
Manager (www.snipca.com/26596).
Download and install the latest
version (5.1.33, at time of writing).
Now, whenever you want to download
something large, instead of clicking the
download button (or link) on the web
page, drag and drop it into the main
section of Free Download Manager’s
main screen. In the ‘New ﬁle’ window
that opens, select where you want to
save the ﬁle to (your Downloads folder
is the default location, see screenshot
above), then tick the bottom-left
Scheduler box to reveal more scheduling
options. Select the day and time you
want the download to occur then click

Wake yourself up to music
By deﬁnition, alarms are alarming.
It’s much nicer to be woken up – or
reminded of something you need to
do – by your favourite piece of music.
Windows 10’s built-in ‘Alarms & Clock’
app is pretty simplistic and doesn’t allow
much tweaking. But free Microsoft Store
alternative Alarm Clock HD (www.
snipca.com/26599) lets you play the
song of your choice at a speciﬁc time.
You can even set it to play on a recurring
schedule. To do this, click Alarms, then
click ‘+New Alarm’. Give the alarm call a
name, choose the time and the regularity,
then select ‘Custom (mp3)’ from the
Alarm Sound options (see screenshot
below). Click Choose Sound File, browse
to the MP3 ﬁle of choice, click Open,
then click Save.

Remind yourself to
exercise
In the Creators Update addition is
Microsoft expanded support for
scheduling recurring reminders in
Cortana. To set yourself a reminder to,
for example, stretch your legs or walk the
dog, click inside the Start menu search
box, then click the Notebook icon (circle
in a box) and select Reminders. Click the
plus (+) sign, then enter a short reminder
description in the ‘Remember to…’ box
(see screenshot right). Click the Time
box and select one of the time options,
or click ‘Another time…’ and enter the
time and day you want in the options.
Click the ‘Only once’ menu to select from
the available recurrence options – for
example, ‘Every day’ or ‘Every Saturday’ –
then click Remind.

Smartphones and tablets
have a lot of scheduling
and automation features,
from setting alarms to
automatically downloading
updates when connected
to Wi-Fi. One of the most
useful is Do Not Disturb,
which lets you specify
periods where you won’t
be interrupted by calls or
notiﬁcations.
To set this up in iOS,
tap Settings, then Do Not

to Scheduled and select
your time period (see
screenshot).
In Android, tap Settings, then Sound,
then ‘Do not disturb
preferences’. Tap ‘+ Add

addition was the Night Light setting. This
alters your screen’s colour temperature

ruining a good night’s sleep.
To set Night Light to come on and go

Like all tech giants, Microsoft copies
some of its best ideas from smaller
companies. One of its better eﬀorts is the
task-automating service Flow, a rival to
IFTTT. It works in much the same way,
though it leans more heavily towards
Microsoft’s own online tools (in
particular its Oﬃce web apps).
The other big diﬀerence is that the free
version limits you to 750 free ‘ﬂows’ a
month (at 15-minute intervals). This
should be enough for most people.
Paid-for accounts with more ﬂows, aimed
at business people, start from $5 per
month. Both the iOS (www.snipca.

BEAT WINDOWS’ RIGHTCLICK RESTRICTIONS
Windows is very protective of its right-
click options. Making changes typically
requires tweaking the registry. You can
free yourself from these restrictions by
installing Right Click Enhancer (www.
snipca.com/26608, see screenshot),
which lets you edit what appears when
you right-click anywhere in Windows.
It adds new programs to the menu, ﬁle
types to the ‘New’ option, and lets you
choose where to send or move ﬁles
to. There’s a paid-for version for $9.99
(around £7.46) containing advanced
options, but the free edition should be
suﬃcient for most people.

CCLEANER
Prevent certain ﬁles
from being wiped
PC-optimisation program CCleaner is
such a powerful tool there may be times
when you want to rein it in a little.
Perhaps there’s a particular ﬁle you don’t
want wiped every time you run CCleaner’s
scan – such as your internet history.
Select the Cleaner option in the
left-hand pane then click Analyze, as you
normally would to run a scan. When the
list of ﬁles to be deleted appears, double-
click the type you want to preserve (for
example, ‘Google Chrome – Internet
History’). Now select all the ﬁles you
want to retain, right-click them, then
select ‘Add to Exclude list’ (see screenshot
above). From now on whenever you run a
scan with CCleaner these ﬁles will be
left untouched.
If you want to undo your actions and
add ﬁles you previously excluded, click
Options in the left-hand pane, followed
by Exclude. Select all the ﬁles you want to
include in your regular scans, then click
Remove.

Aspect Ratio, and select one. If it still
doesn’t look right, repeat the process
until it does.
MUSICBEE
Play songs by genre
If you don’t feel like listening to an entire
album of songs by the same artist, you
can ask MusicBee to play random tracks
from a selected genre. Right-click any
track, move your cursor down to ‘Play

being the genre of the track you selected).
You can see which songs have been
included in this random playlist in the
top-right corner of the program window.
Adjust your music’s volume
If you ﬁnd that certain albums play
at a lower volume than others, or that
certain tracks are louder, you can ﬁx the
problem using MusicBee’s built-in
volume analyser. To make tracks play at
the optimum level, select them, then
right-click. Next, move your cursor to
‘Send to’, click Volume Analysis (see
screenshot above), then Proceed. If the
optimum level isn’t right for you, adjust
the slider labelled ‘adjust calculated

Find the location of a
track’s ﬁle on your PC
Once you’ve imported a track to
MusicBee, you may still need to locate the
original ﬁle saved on your PC. To do this

Google provides a vast amount of knowledge
at your fingertips, but scammers lie in wait if
you search for the wrong thing. Daniel Booth
reveals what you should never look for
support’ and typically one of the top
sponsored results is for GuruAid. Its
headline sounds promising: ‘Tech
Support for Microsoft - Call Now
(UK Toll Free) - UK.com’ (see screenshot
above). At ﬁrst glance, that sounds
like oﬃcial support for Microsoft
products. Click through to their (very
ugly) website and you’re asked to phone
a number for “toll-free assistance”. But
instead of contacting UK experts, you’ll
reach workers at an Indian call centre
who will subject you to the hardest of
hard sells, pestering you to cough up
hundreds of pounds to ﬁx minor
problems.
GuruAid has been around for some
time. Back in 2011 someone on the
Microsoft Forums asked whether they
could trust the company (www.snipca.
com/26704). Complaints last year show
it’s as awful as ever (www.snipca.
com/26703). For genuine help from
Microsoft, bookmark its Support page
(https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb)
or ring 0344 800 2400.
O
f the trillions of searches Google
processes every year, 15 per cent
are brand new, meaning nobody
has ever typed those speciﬁc
queries before. It’s unlikely they’ll
produce fake search results because they
are not common enough to attract the
attention of fraudsters. Scammers aim
big, trying to exploit search terms that are
typed millions of times every day. To
avoid those traps, make sure you never
search for any of the following.
Software that’s been
discontinued
When companies stop supporting a
program and remove download links to
it, scammers see a chance to con people
who still want to use it. Search for it on
Google and you’ll see results promising to
provide a download, but it’s often malware.
Sometimes the link will download the
genuine program, but charge a fee when
previously it had been free. That was the
tactic used late last year by fraudsters
tempting searchers with Windows Movie
Maker, which Microsoft stopped oﬀering
in October. Click the link in the search
result (see screenshot above) and you’ll
be charged $29.95 to unlock the “full
version”. It’s a crafty con trick that preys
on people’s natural desire to stick with
software they’re familiar with.
Tech support for Microsoft
Many tech-support scammers actively
target you over the phone. They claim to
be calling from Microsoft, and declare in
an ominous voice (often with an Indian
accent) that your computer is riddled
with malware. The ‘miracle’ cure is to
give them control of your computer. Once
in, they waste no time stealing your
sensitive info, such as banking passwords.
There are other ne’er-do-wells who set
traps on Google, just waiting for naive
searchers to fall in. Type ‘Microsoft tech

AVOID OTHER GOOGLE
SCAMS
Google’s ubiquity is a gift to fraudsters.
They use the company’s (generally
positive) reputation to give a veneer of
legitimacy to their shameless scams.
The company exposes some of these
on its website, including emails claiming
you’ve won the ‘Google Lottery’ (which
doesn’t exist), and text messages
saying that the company needs to
phone you to conﬁrm your identity (it
never does this). Visit www.snipca.
com/26702 for more details. You’ll also
ﬁnd ways you can report scams.
Google
What you must
never search for on

Look at the screenshot below showing a
search results page on Bing. Can you see
what’s missing? In May 2016, Microsoft
banned adverts on its search engine for
third-party tech-support companies like
GuruAid. As the image shows, search for
‘Microsoft tech support’ and Microsoft’s
own support page appears ﬁrst. There are
no dodgy adverts above it, so no danger
that you’ll be scammed.
So why hasn’t Google followed
Microsoft’s lead? Could it possibly be
SHOULD YOUSWITCH TO BING?
61
Google now says it detects and disables
85 per cent of fake listings before they
even appear on Google Maps. And to
check that a new listing is genuine, it
sends a postcard to the company’s
claimed address. When a business has
new owners, Google phones them to
verify the change.
While these measures are reassuring,
nothing beats word of mouth when
booking a local service. A friend’s
recommendation can’t be hacked.
Bitcoin investment advice
Scammers love it when a fad becomes a
hysteria, because they know it makes
people less cautious when clicking results
in Google. And nothing generates more
hysteria at the moment than Bitcoin,
the cryptocurrency which rocketed 1,000
per cent in value last year.
There’s nothing wrong with searching
Google for more information about
Bitcoin, or the Blockchain technology
behind it. The safest option is to type a
question, such as ‘What is Bitcoin?’
You’ll have a choice of hundreds of
safe websites, all explaining how the
currency works and examining (in other
words, speculating) whether it’s a real
investment opportunity or a bubble
waiting to burst. Nobody really knows –
and don’t trust anyone who says they do.
But what you shouldn’t search for is
‘Bitcoin investment advice’, or similar
phrases. This will generate dubious
get-rich-quick schemes guaranteeing a
crypto-fortune. Don’t get sucked in.
Charities’ phone numbers
We’re not saying you should stop
donating money over the phone, but
searching Google for the correct number
is fraught with risk. In November last
year, the RSPCA complained to Google
and Ofcom about sites appearing in
search results that were advertising
expensive premium-rate phone numbers
for the charity. People calling the number
are put through to the RSPCA’s National
Control Centre, so they may not realise
they’ve been scammed.
The RSPCA said it found eight rogue
sites in the ﬁrst 10 pages of results. It’s
hard to remove these entries completely,
but the charity asked Google to make
sure they don’t appear too highly.
As this proves, scammers don’t just
exploit people’s curiosity and confusion;
they also take advantage of their kindness.
Only use the phone number that you ﬁnd
on a charity’s oﬃcial website.
The web’s most popular sites
In 2016, Google removed 1.7bn fraudulent
adverts from its results (2017 ﬁgures
haven’t been released yet), but some still
sneak through, particularly those for the
world’s most popular sites. Amazon was a
favourite for criminals last year, and they
are experts at making the scams seem
convincing. For a while in February, the
top paid-for result when searching for
‘Amazon’ was ‘www.amazon.com/
Amazon’. Cleverly constructed to fool
even careful clickers, this link directed
people to a Windows-support scam.
The scam reappeared in November, a
few days before the Black Friday sale
frenzy began (see screenshot below). The
greedy fraudsters were hoping to steal
some of the millions spent by shoppers.
A similar scam using YouTube search
results was also reported.
Scammers will always exploit the
popularity of such sites, so it’s best to
bookmark them if you’re likely to visit
them regularly. That applies not just to
Amazon and YouTube, but also eBay,
Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo and Netﬂix.
Local services on Google Maps
This is the kind of scam that makes you
mourn the passing of the Yellow Pages. In
April last year, Google said it would crack
down on criminals listing fake businesses
in its Maps service. This scam peaked in
2014-15, when Google detected 100,000
fake listings.
The company said fraudsters were
posing as “locksmiths, plumbers,
electricians, and other contractors”.
When customers phone them, they are
quoted an incredibly cheap price. But
once the work is done, they end up being
charged a much higher fee.
17 – 30 January 2018
This advert for Amazon looks genuine, but it’s the work of scammers
because the company makes most of its
money from advertising? Banning adverts
isn’t as lucrative as turning a blind eye.
According to recent data (www.snipca.
com/26709), only 6.6 per cent of all UK
searches were made on Bing. Google
dwarfs it on 90.5 per cent. But we
recommend using Bing for a while to see
whether its search results are accurate
enough for you. If so, then you can stick
with it knowing you won’t be scammed by
so-called tech ‘gurus’ oﬀering ‘aid’.

I have ﬁve email accounts all set
up using the IMAP protocol –
one each for Sky, Yahoo,
Outlook, Hotmail and Gmail. I use the
stock email app on my Samsung Galaxy
S7 smartphone and Thunderbird on my
laptop. All emails sent from the laptop
show in the Sent folder on my phone and
vice versa, except for Gmail where emails
sent on the laptop show in the Sent
folder on the phone, but emails sent from
my phone do not show in the Sent folder
on my laptop. I have Googled the
problem several times and found various

This appears to be a persistent
bug in Samsung’s email app, as
many users report similar or
related problems. As such, we’re unable
to oﬀer an easy or elegant solution –
because it’s down to Samsung to ﬁx these
hiccups by updating the app.
We can’t tell you if or when that will
happen but, while you’re waiting, one
option is to install a diﬀerent email app.
You could either use this as a replacement
for the Samsung app, or just for
synchronising the problematic account.
Google’s own Gmail app is an obvious
choice, and the Sent folder will
synchronise perfectly to both your S7
and laptop. Grab it free of charge from

Q
I bought my ﬁrst tablet, a
Kindle Fire 7, on Black Friday
for £30. I can’t complain about
the price but I’ve discovered the app
store doesn’t have all the same apps as
my iPhone. In particular, I wanted to
use the SwiftKey swipe-typing keyboard
that I’ve installed on my smartphone
but it seems that’s not available for
Kindle. Do you know why this is? Is
there any way to get the iPhone app
working on my Kindle Fire? A friend
says I should look in the Google Play
Store but I can’t ﬁnd that either.
Sally-Ann Davies
A
Your Kindle runs a forked
version of the Android
operating system, called Fire
OS. This is not compatible with iOS,
the operating system that runs on your
iPhone, which is why you can’t run the
Apple version of SwiftKey on your Fire.
Because Fire OS is based on Android
it is actually capable of running very
many apps designed for Android,
including the Android version of
SwiftKey. However, that particular app
is not yet available in Appstore, which
is Amazon’s name for its own app store
— so you can’t obtain it that way.
Tablets running ‘real’ Android
usually include Play Store, which is the
app store run by Google. This is what
your friend was talking about, and
SwiftKey is indeed in the Play Store.
However, the Fire does not come with
Play Store, so you can’t get SwiftKey
that way, either.
But there is a way to get SwiftKey
— and other Android apps — running
on your Fire, and that’s to use a
technique known as ‘side loading’.
You’ll ﬁrst need to ﬁnd and download
an app’s installation ﬁle, known as an
Android Package Kit or APK. Some
developers make these freely available
from their own websites, while others
will have to be sourced from elsewhere.
SwiftKey falls into the latter category,
though its APK is available from a few

reliable sources. That means you can
use side-loading to install it on your
Fire. However, you proceed at your own
risk because you’ll be installing
software that hasn’t been oﬃcially
vetted by Amazon or Google.
Grab your Kindle Fire, then tap
Apps followed by Settings and then
Applications. Flip the ‘Apps from
Unknown Sources’ switch to the On
position, and then tap OK to conﬁrm.
Now launch the Kindle Silk browser
and visit www.snipca.com/26507.
This is the APKMirror website run by
the trusted Android Police website
(www.androidpolice.com). Click the
link for the latest (non-beta) version of
SwiftKey, which when we visited was
6.7.3.28, and then click for the latest
‘arm’ (ARM) version for ‘Android 4.1+’.
Now click the Download APK button.
The download should take just a few
seconds. Tap Silk’s menu button (three
horizontal lines) and then choose

I was reviewing ﬁles stored

Q
I took advantage of the last-ditch
chance to upgrade my old
Windows Vista desktop PC to
Windows 10, using the accessibility
loophole that you detailed in Issue 516
(see the Workshop on page 38). As I had
a legitimate copy of Windows 7 on DVD
I ﬁrst used that to do a clean install to
wipe Vista, and then used Microsoft’s
generosity to upgrade to Windows 10. All
seemed to go without a hitch, but I can’t
seem to install the graphics card drivers.
I found out, perhaps too late, that
this PC’s Nvidia 7900 graphics card
apparently isn’t compatible with
Windows 10, so there are no Windows
10 drivers! I thought I’d try my luck with
the Windows 7 drivers but they refuse
to install, with the only error message
being a terse ‘Failed’. The PC is working
ﬁne apart from the graphics, which are
slow and clunky (and they weren’t under
Vista, so I know it’s not the hardware).
I contacted Nvidia, who told me the card
was unsupported and it had no plans to
introduce Windows 10 drivers. Do you
know of any way around this?
Daniel Burroughs
A
We’re afraid your graphics card
is over a decade old and there is
no prospect of Nvidia releasing
drivers for Windows 10. However, while
this card is oﬃcially not supported it is
actually possible to install the most recent
drivers for Windows 7 and 8.1.
It sounds like you already have those but
do check at www.geforce.co.uk/drivers –
the version number you want is
309.08. And just to be crystal clear,
if you’re making your selection
from the dropdown menus in the
Manual Driver Search section, then
choose GeForce 7 Series (see
screenshot), and not GeForce 700
Series. The latter drivers are for
much-more-recent graphics cards.
Next, you’ll need to fool both
Windows and Nvidia’s drivers into
running the new drivers. To do this,
right-click the downloaded ﬁle (called
‘309.08-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-
64bit-international-whql.exe’) and
choose Properties. Now click the
Compatibility tab, tick the box labelled
‘Run this program in compatibility mode
for’ and from the dropdown menu below
this choose Windows 7. Now click OK.
Finally, double-click the driver ﬁle
to begin the installation and follow
the prompts, restarting your PC when
it’s ﬁnished.

Q
As I’ve gotten older my

stiﬀ, so needs a lot of pressure to
turn it. I ﬁnd myself pressing too
hard and clicking the button that
this wheel also has. That activates an
annoying scroll mode that I never
use. So, I’d like to disable my scroll-
wheel button. Could you tell me
how to do this, please?
Eric Harman
A
It depends on your mouse
or, more accurately, its
driver. You didn’t tell us
the make and model, but in most
cases changing the setting is easy. In
the ﬁrst instance, click Start followed
by the Settings cog, and then Devices
followed by Mouse. Next, click ‘Additional
mouse options’ (see screenshot). This
opens the Mouse Properties box.
Now click the tab relating to your
mouse. For a Microsoft mouse, for
instance, click the ‘Mouse and Keyboard
Center’ tab followed by ‘Click here to
change Microsoft mouse settings’. Next,
click ‘basic settings’ followed by ‘Wheel
button’, then choose ‘Disable this button’.
Click the Back button (the left arrow),
and you’re done.
If you don’t see a mouse-speciﬁc tab in
the Mouse Properties box, then head to
the mouse manufacturer’s website to
download and install the latest driver.

After downloading the

alarmed to see a large number of
gigabytes of space disappear from
my computer’s C drive. During my
investigations I went to the
Administrative Tools section of Control
Panel and launched Disk Clean-up. I
used this to scan C drive, then noticed
an unticked box labelled ‘Previous
Windows Installation(s)’ that’s hogging
a massive 30.8GB of disk space. I’m not
sure what they mean by ‘Previous

In the context of your
particular setup, ‘Previous
Windows installation(s)’
means the ﬁles that allow you to revert
to an earlier version of Windows 10.
So, in your case, most if not all of the

possibly, the Anniversary Update (AU,

Q
While testing my broadband
speed I saw a new Wi-Fi name,
alongside my and my
neighbour’s Sky routers. My neighbour’s
connection is blocked but this new
connection said it was free and open for
use, so I assumed it was a hotspot. I
connected my PC to it and immediately
noticed a welcome speed boost, and
nothing untoward happened. But when
I told my son he was very suspicious, and
thought that it could be used to steal my
personal information. I have returned to
my Sky router, but do you think this free
connection is safe to use?
Ian E Mitchell
A
You didn’t tell us the name of
this mystery Wi-Fi device,
but there’s no way we’d
recommend connecting to a random
router or hotspot. Even using a hotspot
in a public space such as a café or
library carries risk, but at least you’ll
normally know who’s providing
the service.
If you’re lucky then there was nothing
malicious behind this, because a
neighbour or nearby business had failed
to secure their own connection. If that’s
the case, there’s no harm done — and
they’ll probably never know that you
connected, either.

beneﬁt from the extra cores — such as
gamers and video producers.
With its eighth-generation Core
range, Intel has caught up in the
processor-core stakes but, like for like,
Ryzen is typically still cheaper.
Q
Your explanation of Intel
Core processor diﬀerences
(Problems Solved, Issue 514)
was interesting. However, it left me
wondering about the diﬀerence
between Intel and AMD. AMD’s Ryzen
has been getting a lot of publicity
recently. Is it basically the same as an
Intel Core processor? If I bought a PC
with a Ryzen chip, would it run all the
same software?
Mark Metcalfe
A
Your second question is both
the easiest to answer and the
most relevant so, yes — an
AMD Ryzen processor will run all the
same software as an equivalent Intel
Core chip. Or, more accurately, a
computer with a Ryzen CPU will run
any major PC operating system, and
that operating system will in turn run
all the software it normally does. For
most PC users, that obviously now
means Windows 10.
Beyond that, things quickly become
much more complicated. If you digested
our previous answer then you’ll know
that there are a dizzying number of Core
processors in existence, beyond the
primary designations of i3, i5, i7 and i9.
These processors diﬀer by multiple
speciﬁcations, with the key ones being
number of processor cores, clock speeds
and cache, and the presence or otherwise
of integrated graphics (a PC powered by a
processor with integrated graphics
needn’t have a graphics card, though
many still do). There are also various
‘generations’ of each Intel Core processor,
with the most recent generation being
the eighth.
The generation and number of cores
are key. When AMD launched Ryzen,
midway through 2017, the (then-top)
seventh-generation Core i7 had just four
cores. The equivalent Ryzen 7 has eight.
AMD’s chip was also considerably
cheaper at all tiers (Ryzen 3, 5 and 7
models are pitched against the Core i3, i5
and i7). That made it a very attractive
option, particularly for users most able to

Q
My Windows 10 PC recently
applied the Fall Creators Update
(FCU). I watched as it did this,
and saw it crash midway through.
Windows said that it would recover itself,
Why have my searches stopped working?
which it duly did. My PC seems to be
running okay, but since this event when
I execute a search in a File Explorer
window it doesn’t seem to ﬁnd what I
want. All I get is the message ‘No items
match your search’. Previously, I could
type a word or phrase I knew to be in a
particular document and that document
would appear in the results list right
away. Oddly, searches still work on my
C drive, but not on drive D or E, where
I respectively keep my photos and
documents. Could this have been
caused by the crash I witnessed? And
do you know how to get my searches
working again?
Kev Concannon
A
It sounds like the index File
Explorer uses for searches has
either been disabled or has been
corrupted, which could indeed have been
the result of the crash during the FCU
update. Re-enabling or rebuilding the
index will ﬁx this.
First, click Start, type index then click
Indexing Options. If your D and E drives
are listed under the Included Locations
heading, then the index is most likely
corrupt. To ﬁx this, click the Advanced
button and then, in the Troubleshooting
section, click Rebuild (see screenshot)
followed by OK to conﬁrm.
If the drives aren’t listed then you
need to re-add them to the index. Click
Modify and then, under ‘Change selected
locations’, tick both drive D and E, and
then click OK.
If your files have become corrupted, you can
delete and rebuild them in Index Settings

Why won’t web version of
WhatsApp work?
Q
The ‘Problem of the Fortnight’ in
Issue 516’s Problems Solved section
explained a workaround for using the
web version of WhatsApp on an iPad.
This doesn’t work for me, as I don’t have
the Request Desktop Site button in the
Share menu. My iPad runs the latest
version of iOS 11. Could this be anything
to do with the fact that previously I had
installed another version of WhatsApp,
called Messenger? I have deleted this, but
I wonder if my iPad still ‘sees’ it.
Peter Lewin
A
It’s not because of the now-deleted
Messenger app. Rather, it’s probably
that you yourself can’t see the Request
Desktop Site button. That’s because it’s
not always in view, and it’s not at all
obvious that the displayed strip of icons
icons is scrollable. So, just swipe from
right to left to bring the button into view
(see screenshot above), then tap it and
the web version of WhatsApp will appear,
as per our original instructions.
How do I replace my antivirus?
Q
Following your review of antivirus
software in Issue 516, I would like to
change programs. However, I don’t know
how to delete my old antivirus software
from my system before installing a new
one. Any advice that you can give me
would be very helpful.
Paul Wynn
A
Removing security software is usually
no diﬀerent to uninstalling any
other kind of program. First, open the
security tool in question and choose the
option to exit or fully close the program.
You’ll probably be confronted by a box
warning that you’ll be left unprotected,
and conﬁrming that you wish to proceed:
click Yes or Agree. Now it’s disabled, you
can remove it just like any other program.
In Windows 10, click Start followed by
the Settings cog and then Apps. Now
click the app, followed by Uninstall (see
screenshot below) and then Uninstall to
conﬁrm. In earlier Windows editions,
launch Control Panel and then, under
Programs, click ‘Uninstall a program’,
then proceed as above.
How do I install the
Fall Creators Update?
Q
I followed the Windows Update
Workshop in Issue 514 and
discovered that version 1709 – the Fall
Creators Update (FCU) – had not been
installed. I get a message saying: “One
or more Windows Update components
are conﬁgured incorrectly. Error
0x800703f9”. I’ve tried troubleshooting
it many times but it always comes back
to these messages. Can you help, please?
Colin Roberts
A
There are many possible reasons
for errors like this. The sure-ﬁre
way to get the update installed is to use
Microsoft’s media-creation tool to create
an installation disc or USB stick, as this
takes the current Windows 10 installation
out of the loop. It’s a free download from
www.snipca.com/26587. Choose the
‘Create Windows 10 installation media’
option (see screenshot above), then
create a DVD or USB stick. Now restart
your PC with this disc or stick inserted,
then follow the prompts to apply FCU.
How do I ﬁx my custom PC?
Q
After reading the story in Issue 516
about the ﬂaw with Intel processors,
I turned to the Workshop on page 42
and used the company’s Detection Tool,
which advised me that I ‘may’ be liable to
being hacked and to download a ﬁx from
my PC manufacturer. However, therein
lies the rub: I built the PC myself in 2010,
with an Intel i5 750 2.6GHz processor.
Obviously, I do not have a maker to turn
to, so can you oﬀer any advice as to what
to do next?
Trevor Stanswood
A
If a ﬁx is available, or becomes
available, it will be in the form
of a BIOS update for the computer’s
motherboard. So, in your case you’ll need
to visit the website of your motherboard
manufacturer, and check the relevant
support pages for updates. Note that not

KeepYourBrainActive
exercise that really, really got me was a
simple one: that if you’re shown the same
shape twice running, you click a tick (see
screenshot above). As simple as that. So
simple that every time I tried, the game
gave me a minus score, and if it could,
would have mockingly told all its mates at
the Microsoft Store. That aside, I’m very
happy to recommend it, though I’m not
sure my brain gained anything, as was
promised.
With some trepidation, I moved on to
Brain Calculator (www.snipca.com/
26624), which comes with a ‘12’ age
rating for some reason. At ﬁrst I thought
it was because there was too much maths
for younger minds, because the ﬁrst
exercise just wanted me to do sums.
H
mmm. I feel that, three
columns in, my tenure
on this prized back
page is under threat already.
Over a cup of better-than-
usual instant coﬀee, I
persuaded the editor of this
organ that brain training is the
in-thing, and that scientiﬁc
research would back me up.
This would send sales of the
magazine through the roof.
Then the science came in.
Latest example? The Practice
Center of Minnesota issued a
study suggesting that brain
training has no impact at all on
slowing dementia. On the
upside, they suggested it can
improve cognitive skills. Inspired by this,
I tried three free apps from the Microsoft
Store that might help.
My challenge for 2018 is, via the power
of computer software, to play games that
claim to physically grow my brain. They
won’t just make me smarter; they’ll
actually add new brain cells. Wow! That’s
the promise in the title of the game Gain
More Brain (www.snipca.com/26623).
I soon became fascinated by it, not
least because it takes eﬀort just to work
out what you need to do. I realise I have
the male gene that makes reading
instructions optional, but still. When this
game shows you what to do, it’s great.
When it tries to explain things, it
struggles a bit.
You take a bunch of tests, get a score,
then compare it to others worldwide (I
declined, fearing humiliation). The one

Again, it’s light on explanation,
but the likes of Concentration,
which prompts you to ﬁnd
matching pairs of pictures in a
grid, are straightforward
enough. And actually very
addictive. Likewise,
Imagination (see screenshot
below left) cleverly asks you to
identify objects from diﬀerent
angles, such as from above.
One for the sparrows in my
garden, perhaps.
After all this strenuous
mental exercise, my head
needed a friend, so gleefully
ignoring the one-star review
bestowed upon it in the
Microsoft Store, I downloaded
Brain Buddy (www.snipca.com/26625).
But it’s not your Buddy at all. One star
might be a little harsh, but there’s little
cerebral pleasure to be had by matching
poorly designed pairs. Worse, when you
ﬁnish you’re rewarded with a dancing
green vegetable (see screenshot below)
that I wouldn’t want as part of my
Sunday roast. It’s harsh to grumble when
something is free, but then I’m old, and
having a good moan is one of the perks of
ageing. In an eerie parallel of my career,
this game does nothing that hasn’t been
done a lot better elsewhere.
After playing three games in an hour, I
closed my computer with my brain ﬁrmly
the same size as it was just over 600
words ago. Maybe watering it with more
coﬀee will help it grow.
